Road Traffic - Offences – Dangerous driving

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9602/2020/01.\]

18 August 2020

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 55-year-old Singaporean male, was charged with an offence of dangerous driving under section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”) for a road traffic accident involving three vehicles.

2       On 21 August 2019 at about 4.41pm, the accused failed to conform to the traffic red light signal when he travelled straight across the junction of Sixth Avenue and Jalan Haji Alias in his motorcar no. SDH6808H (“the accused’s motorcar”). The accused was travelling along Sixth Avenue towards the direction of Holland Road. This resulted in a collision with motor taxi no. SHD7039C (“the first victim’s taxi”), which was turning right from the opposite direction with the traffic light signal showing green right arrow. The second victim was a passenger in the first victim’s taxi.

3       The impact from this collision (“first collision”) in turn caused the first victim’s taxi to spin and collide into the front right portion of motorcar no. SKA8178H (“the third victim’s motorcar”). The third victim’s motorcar was stationary on the next lane (which was meant for vehicles travelling straight or turning left) to the first victim’s taxi prior to the first collision due to the traffic red light signal. This was the second collision.

4       The accused’s motorcar did not stop immediately after the first collision with the first victim’s taxi. It continued to move forward and collide into the rear right portion of the third victim’s motorcar. This was the third collision.

5       On 6 July 2020, the accused pleaded guilty before me to the singular dangerous driving charge. Accordingly, the accused was thereafter sentenced as follows:

6       On 14 July 2020, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal because he was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed on him.

7       The accused has since paid the fine in full and did not apply for a stay of the disqualification order pending the appeal.

## Background facts

### The Charge

8       The dangerous driving charge reads as follows:

> You, are charged that on the 21 August 2019 at about 4.41pm along Sixth Avenue did drive/ride motorcar No. SDH6808H in a manner which was dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road, to wit, by failing to conform to red light signal whilst travelling straight thus resulting in a collision with a motor taxi which was making a right turn from the opposite direction and then colliding into a stationary motorcar and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act Chapter 276.

### Statement of facts

9       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 3 September 2019 without qualification. A concise, succinct and edited version of both the SOF depicting the offence of the dangerous driving charge reads as follows:

> …

> **First Incident Report**

> 5.    On 21st August 2019 at about 4.41 pm, Police received a call from Ms Vita who reported: “_CAR ACCIDENT, WE NEED AMBULANCE. SOMEONE CRYING INSIDE THE CAR. I AM THE INNOCENT VICTIM_”. The incident location was given as “Laurel Wood Ave and Sixth Ave”.

> **Facts relating to case**

> 6.    On 21st August 2019, at or about 4.41 p.m., the Defendant did drive Singapore registered motorcar, SDH6808H, at the signalized cross junction of Sixth Ave by Jalan Haji Alias, Singapore, in a manner which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time or might reasonably expected to be on the road, to wit, by failing to conform to red light signal whilst travelling straight thus resulting in a collision with a motor taxi, SHD7039C driven by the First Victim who was making a right turn from the opposite direction. The impact caused the First Victim’s taxi to spin and collide onto a stationary motor car, SKA8178H driven by the Third Victim.

> 7.    CCTV from First Victim’s in-car camera clearly shows that he was travelling along Sixth Ave towards Bt Timah Rd on lane 1 of 2 lanes. At the junction of Jalan Haji Alias, traffic light was showing red with green right turning arrow. When the First Victim proceeded to make a right turn, the Defendant who was travelling straight on the centre of 3 lanes along the opposite direction continued proceeding straight across the junction and collided into the First Victim’s front portion. The impact caused the First Victim’s motor taxi to spin and collide into the Third Victim’s front right corner portion of the motor car. At the time, the Third Victim’s motorcar was stationary on the left of 2 lanes abreast of the First Victim’s taxi prior to the impact from the Defendant. After the collision, the Defendant’s motorcar continued moving forward and collide onto the right rear portion of the Third Victim motorcar.

> 8.    CCTV from the Third Victim’s in-car camera shows that she was travelling on the left of 2 lanes along Sixth Ave towards Bt Timah Rd. Upon approaching the junction of Jalan Haji Alias, the Third Victim’s motorcar was seen slowing down before coming to a stop as traffic light turned red. When the traffic light showed red with green right turning arrow, the First Victim’s taxi who was abreast of her on the right of 2 lanes proceeded to make a right turn into Jalan Haji Alias. Whilst the First Victim’s taxi was making the right turn, the Defendant’s motorcar came from the opposite direction and collide into the front portion of the First Victim’s taxi causing his vehicle to spin and collide onto the front right corner of the Third Victim’s vehicle.

> **Damages**

> 9.    The Defendant’s motorcar sustained dents and cracks mostly on the front and right portions.

> 10.    The First Victim’s motor taxi sustained dents and cracks on the front and right front portion.

> 11.    The Third Victim’s motorcar sustained scratches and dents on the front right corner and right rear portion.

> **Injuries**

> 12.    As a result of the accident, the Second Victim \[who was a rear seat passenger in the First Victim’s motor taxi\] sustained neck pain due to whiplash and was conveyed by ambulance to National University Hospital where discharged with 7 days of medical leave.

> **Prevailing Condition**

> 13.    At the time of accident, the weather was clear, road surface was dry, traffic flow was light and visibility was good.

> …

![]([2020] SGDC 0185 _Image/[2020] SGDC 0185 _image1.png)

## Antecedents

11     The accused was traced for two previous traffic convictions. On 21 November 1984, he was convicted for reckless or dangerous driving under s 26(1) (Cap 92, Reprint 1973) of the old RTA and sentenced to a fine of $800 and disqualified from driving for Class 2 licence for a period of two years. On 5 September 1989, the accused was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $400 for speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA (Cap 276).

12     Besides the traffic convictions, the accused had eight compounded speeding and one compounded failing to conform to the red light signal offences between the period from 30 November 1990 to 29 August 2014.

13     The accused confirmed his antecedents to be correct.

14     In respect of his conviction under the s 26(1) provision for reckless or dangerous driving of the old RTA, the Prosecution submitted that for the purpose of the present dangerous driving charge under s 64(1) of the RTA, the accused would not be considered as a repeat offender in that this would not be considered as his second or subsequent conviction for reckless or dangerous driving.

15     Nonetheless, Prosecution submitted that the s 26(1) conviction under the old RTA would still be considered a similar and relevant previous conviction for sentencing purpose.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

16     The Prosecution orally submitted for a maximum fine of $5,000 and a disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“DQAC”) for a period of 12 months.

17     The Prosecution highlighted that in terms of culpability, it was medium as the accused had beaten the red light at the traffic light junction. As a result, the accused’s motorcar collided into two vehicles, one of which was stationary on the opposite side of the road.

18     In terms of harm, there was property damage caused to two vehicles. The costs of damage for both vehicles were not available in this case. The second victim, who was a passenger in the first victim’s motor taxi, was also injured. Thankfully, her injuries were not serious as she had sustained neck pain due to a whiplash injury arising from the accident. She was not hospitalised but given seven days of medical leave. As such, overall, the harm caused was between the slight to moderate range.

19     Hence, the Prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold was not crossed in the present case. Nonetheless, as the accused was previously traced with a relevant dangerous driving conviction in 1984 as well as a speeding conviction in 1989, the Prosecution was of the view that as a matter of both general and specific deterrence, a maximum fine of $5,000 together with a 12-month DQAC was necessary to be imposed on the accused.

20     Finally, as the accident happened prior to 1 November 2019, in coming to its submissions on sentence, the Prosecution did not consider or rely on the accused’s nine other compounded traffic offences pursuant to s 139AA of the amended RTA. The new s 139AA of the RTA only came into effect on 1 November 2019. The Prosecution further drew reference from the High Court decision of _PP v Neo Chuan Sheng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 97</span> (“_Neo Chuan Sheng”_).

## Mitigation

21     The Defence, on the other hand, submitted a sentence for a $3,000 fine and a DQAC of 6 months to be imposed on the accused.

22     In support of its submissions, the Defence tendered a written mitigation on behalf of the accused.

23     At the material time of the accident, the accused was employed as a chauffeur for a family who lives in the vicinity of Sixth Avenue. The accused was driving an S-Class Mercedes Benz, which was one of the larger models of the salon car series. He was driving the motorcar in the course of his employment and was not driving under the influence of alcohol.

24     In terms of culpability, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, the traffic flow was light and visibility was good. Therefore, the speed at which the accused was driving across the junction did not demand any special consideration. The beating of the red light by the accused was further unmotivated and was due to a one second delay in stopping.

25     Furthermore, based on the damage patterns of the vehicles involved, the damage caused to the motor taxi was largely located to the front of the vehicle, thus suggesting that the motor taxi had only just started to execute the right turn. Hence, whilst the accused had beaten the red light, he was not so blameworthy since the lights had only just turned red at the traffic light junction. This was not a situation where the lights had been red for a substantial period.

26     In support of its proposition that the accused had only just beaten the red light in a matter of one second, it invited this court to consider the case of _Jali Bin Mohd Yunos v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1059</span> (“_Jali_) at \[6\] of the headnotes:

> The Question was therefore answered as follows:

>> (1)    finding of rashness in sentencing in road traffic offences requires consciousness as to the risk by the accused (who is in charge of the vehicle). In this regard, rashness and recklessness are treated as interchangeable concepts.

>> (2)    Such consciousness includes:

>>> (a)    situations in which there was in fact subjective appreciation of the risk by the accused; and

>>> (b)    situations in which the risk is so obvious that the accused ought, as a reasonable person, to have known of it, inasmuch as had he paused to consider it, it would have been artificial to have ignored a risk.

>> (3)    However, in Situation (2)(b) above, there might nevertheless be no finding of rashness or recklessness on the part of the accused where there exist exceptional circumstances, for example, where the accused acted under some understandable and excusable mistake or where his capacity to appreciate risks was adversely affected by some condition not involving fault on his part. There might also be cases where the accused acted as he did in a sudden dilemma created by the actions of others: at \[32\]

27     The Defence sought to argue that the accused’s consciousness at the material time was affected by the subjective appreciation of the risk by the accused himself and the situational risk.

28     This submission by the Defence was rather puzzling in my view and it was unclear to me how this would bolster the accused’s point that he had only just beaten the red light by only one second. _Jali_ was a case where the applicant had pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death under s 66(1) of the RTA where he drove into a traffic junction when the traffic light was red against him. This resulted in the death of a pedestrian. The applicant had failed to check the state of the traffic lights as he had followed the vehicle in front of him.

29     However, the Defence then went on to say that the collision had happened because the taxi was making a right turn from the opposition direction when the accused was travelling straight on the centre lane of a three-lane road. The Defence urge this court to bear in mind that even though the accused was at fault for the collision, the situation at that time involved a large Mercedes Benz which collided into a lighter and smaller diesel operated taxi. Following from there, the taxi then spun and collided into another stationary car (which I noted that the third victim’s motorcar was a white BMW, also another European car). Given that this situation was similar in nature to a chain collision, the accused’s culpability in terms of the second collision should be given less weight when determining sentence.

30     In terms of harm, the Defence reiterated that when compared to the weight of the accused’s motorcar, the damage caused to the other two vehicles would have to be considered as minor. They involved dents, cracks and scratches. The second victim also suffered minor injury.

31     In the circumstances, the Defence submitted that the present case was not as egregious as the situations in _PP v Koh Thiam Huat_ \[2017\] 4 SLR 1009 (“_Koh Thiam Huat_”) or _PP v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1141</span> (“_Aw Tai Hock_”). Instead, it submitted that the High Court decision of _Neo Chuan Sheng_ should be followed.

32     Moreover, after the accident, the accused rendered all necessary assistance to the victims and was extremely remorseful. He pleaded guilty at an early stage. His previous traffic convictions were very dated and should be disregarded completely. His compounded offences should not be considered.

33     Lastly, the accused’s current employer would like to inform the court that the accused has been an exemplary driver and she even entrusted her grandchildren with the accused to perform various errands. For a long time, the accused was not involved in any other accident until the present one.

## Decision on Sentence

### Section 64(1) of the RTA

34     S 64(1) of the RTA prior to 1 November 2019 (i.e. the old provision) states:

> Reckless or dangerous driving

> 64.—(1)    If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

35     For the disqualification period, pursuant to s42(1) of the RTA:

> Disqualification for offence

> 42.— (1)    A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

36     For the present case, the Prosecution has treated the accused as a first offender and he would therefore not be liable to the punishment of a second or repeat offender even though the accused has a previous conviction for reckless or dangerous driving under s 26(1) of the old RTA (Cap 92, 1973 Edition).

37     The history of the RTA commenced with the original enactment of the Road Traffic Act on 1 January 1963 via Ordinance 26 of 1961. It was then renamed the Road Traffic Act (1970 Revised Edition, Cap 92) (“old Act”). There were reprints of this version in 1973 and 1985. The new Road Traffic Act 1985 Revised Edition under Cap 276 commenced on 30 March 1987(“new Act”). Since then, the RTA has always kept the Chapter No. 276 until the present day. The present edition is the Revised Edition 2004 with the latest amendments made to it on 1 November 2019.

38     In essence, whilst the Chapter No. of the RTA has changed once and its editions several times throughout its history, the primary Act has always remained the same. As stated in its preamble, the RTA has always been “_An Act for the regulation of road traffic and the use of vehicles and the users of roads and for other purposes connected therewith_”. Following from there, even though the provision for reckless or dangerous driving has been changed from s 26(1) under the old Act to s 64(1) under the new Act, to my mind, the nature of the offence the RTA seeks to regulate has not changed over the years.

39     Therefore, even though I was of the view that the accused should be considered a repeat or second offender for dangerous or reckless driving, I was prepared to accept the Prosecution’s position to treat the accused as a first offender under s 64(1) of the RTA in consideration of the punishment provision to be invoked as this was a favourable or not an adverse position for the accused. Instead, I treated the accused’s s 26(1) RTA conviction as a similar or relevant conviction for the purpose of sentence.

### Sentencing framework for dangerous driving

40     Before I come to the appropriate sentence to impose for the present case, it would be useful to highlight the seminal High Court decision of _Koh Thiam Huat_ as cited by the Defence, which was a case that similarly involved a dangerous driving offence. In _Koh Thiam Huat_, the High Court has set out the two principal parameters to which a sentencing court should have regard in evaluating the seriousness of a crime, which is applicable to a traffic offence, and they are:

> (a)     harm caused by the offence; and

> (b)     the accused’s culpability.

41     See Kee Oon J held at \[41\] that “harm” is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence and “culpability” is a measure of the degree of blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act.

42     In the context of the offence of dangerous driving, See J further held at \[41\]:

> …the primary factor relating to the harm caused would be the extent of injury or damage caused. _A related and equally important consideration would be the potential harm that might have resulted, given that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike_. The factors increasing the accused’s culpability would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving. As illustrations, the aggravating factors identified in Hue An Li, i.e., speeding, drink-driving and sleepy driving, would clearly contribute to this, as would driving while using a mobile phone. In addition, _if the dangerous driving was deliberate (for instance, in “hell riding” cases), this would also indicate a higher level of culpability_. Aside from these two principal parameters, the court should also have regard to other mitigating and aggravating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence per se. These include (but are not limited to) an accused’s good or bad driving record, as well as his remorse or lack thereof. \[emphasis added\]

43     As such, in terms of “harm”, this includes any potential harm that might have been caused to other road users or pedestrians as an important factor for the courts’ consideration when it comes to dangerous driving behaviour.

44     In terms of “culpability”, factors which would increase the accused’s culpability would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving, aggravating factors (like speeding, drink driving and sleepy driving) and the deliberate manner of driving dangerously.

45     Aside from these two principal parameters, the court should also have regard to other mitigating and aggravating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence per se. They could include the accused’s driving record as well as his remorse or lack thereof.

46     In _Aw Tai Hock_, which was also cited by the Defence, it was enunciated by the High Court at \[37\] that the factors which affect culpability for dangerous driving offences would generally include (a) the manner of driving; (b) the circumstances of driving; and (c) the offender’s reasons for driving.

47     In terms of the manner of driving, Steven Chong JA highlighted at \[38\] that this assesses how dangerous the driving was and the extent of danger to road users posed by the offender’s conduct. Examples of situations where the culpability of the offender would be increased include speeding, drink-driving, sleepy driving, driving whilst using a mobile phone, flouting of traffic rules, driving against the flow of traffic or off the road, involvement in a car chase, or exhibiting poor control of one’s vehicle.

48     As for the circumstances of driving, the circumstances surrounding the incident that may have increased the danger to road users during the incident must also be taken into account. They would include instances where the offender drives:

> (a)     during rush hours and when volume of traffic is heavy;

> (b)     within a residential or school zone;

> (c)     a heavy vehicle that is more difficult to control and requires a quicker reaction time; or

> (d)     a substantial distance to reach his destination or intends to do so: See \[39\].

49     For the reasons or motivations for driving that can increase the culpability of an offender, Chong JA said at \[40\] that such situations included deliberate act of driving in a dangerous manner as compared to a genuine emergency or other extenuating circumstances.

50     Finally, it has been affirmed in both _Koh Thiam Huat_ (at \[60\]) and _Aw Tai Hock_ (at \[28\]) that the primary sentencing consideration for dangerous driving offences are those of specific and general deterrence.

### The appropriate sentence to impose

#### Culpability of the accused

51     The accused conceded that he had beaten the red light. Although the Defence sought to argue that the accused had “only just beaten the red light in a matter of one second” or that the lights at the traffic light junction have only just turned red against the accused, the video footages of the accident obtained from the in-vehicle front cameras of the first victim and third victim did not seem to support that proposition.

52     Still images taken from the video footages showing how the accident happened are as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0185 _Image/[2020] SGDC 0185 _image2.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0185 _Image/[2020] SGDC 0185 _image3.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0185 _Image/[2020] SGDC 0185 _image4.png)

53     It was evident that the traffic light had turned red at the junction as the accused was approaching the junction. It was about two car lengths before the accused’s motorcar would have reached the junction. Therefore, it was not a situation whereby the traffic light had only just turned red as the accused’s car reached the junction.

54     As seen from the video footages, the white van traveling on the next lane and ahead of the accused’s motorcar had already stopped when the traffic light turned red. Yet, even though there was no evidence before me to suggest that the accused was speeding at the material time, it was clear that the accused failed to slow down or be prepared to stop when approaching the traffic light junction.

55     When the green arrow signal came on and the first victim’s taxi started to make a right turn, once again, the accused did not slow down, jam his brakes or stop his motorcar. He continued to proceed straight ahead across the junction. This resulted in an effectively head-on collision between the accused’s motorcar and the first victim’s taxi. The bonnet of the taxi was effectively crushed and dented inwards due to the collision.

56     Despite the fact that the first victim’s taxi was not travelling at a fast speed as it has just started to make the right turn from a stationary position, due to the impact from the collision, the taxi spun 180 degrees and collided straight into the front right portion of the third victim’s stationary motorcar before coming to a stop. The third victim’s motorcar, which was travelling in the same direction as the first victim’s taxi earlier, was waiting in a stationary position at the junction due to the traffic red light signal.

57     Unfortunately, as a double whammy for the third victim, the accused failed to brake or stop his motorcar after the first collision with the first victim’s taxi. Instead, the accused lost control of his motorcar, went against the flow of traffic on the opposite side of the road across the junction and collided into the rear right corner of the third victim’s motorcar before finally coming to a halt some distance away along the side of the road.

58     This would not be what I would call a typical chain collision situation as described by the Defence. The accident was caused by the accused when he beat the red light and the green arrow light had already come on for vehicles on the opposite side to turn right.

59     As mentioned earlier, in _Aw Tai Hock_, the flouting of traffic rules would increase the culpability of an accused.

60     Further, in the case of _Jali_ as submitted by the Defence, it was held by the Court of Appeal at \[22\] and \[23\] that:

> \[22\]  …_it is clear and axiomatic that when a driver drives into a signalised traffic junction, he must ensure that the traffic lights are in his favour in order to avoid the dire (or even tragic) consequences that might ensue if they are not, in fact, in his favour. If he chooses to drive into such a junction and does not bother to check the state of the traffic lights, he is not merely negligent; he has committed a rash or reckless act_….

> \[23\]  …what if the accused _simply did not bother to check the lights at all_, and drove into the signalised traffic junction without more? In our view, that would clearly be a _rash or reckless_ act. It is clear that to drive into a _signalised traffic junction without checking the state of the traffic lights (for whatever reason)_ would be to consciously and deliberately do an act with the knowledge that this might cause damage and/or personal injury, or even death. It is a conscious and deliberate act that demonstrates a _heedlessness or indifference towards the risks just mentioned_. It is not merely negligence or carelessness; it is _rashness or recklessness._ \[emphasis in original\]

61     In the circumstances, given that there was a certain degree of rash or reckless driving in the manner of driving by the accused in beating the red light, I would agree with the Prosecution that the accused’s culpability in this case was medium. Moreover, it was a situation where the accused had even failed to slow down or stop when he approached the traffic light junction. In fact, the accused had failed to brake or attempted to or stop even as he collided into the first victim’s taxi.

62     As an added point, I disagreed with the Defence’s argument that the accused’s consciousness as to the risk for beating the red light was affected in this case and there were no exceptional circumstances present to suggest otherwise.

#### Harm caused by the offence

63     As for the actual harm caused, it was fortuitous that the second victim suffered minor injuries as a consequence of the accident. She had sustained neck pain due to a whiplash injury arising from the accident. She was not hospitalised but was given seven days of medical leave.

64     In terms of property damage, even though the costs of damage for both the first victim’s taxi and the third victim’s motorcar were not available, the still images from the video footages showed that the front portion of the taxi was rather badly damaged and the bonnet was crumpled inwards. This was confirmed by the vehicle damage report where it was recorded that the front portion of the taxi was dented, cracked, crumped and scratched with the front bumper being ripped off. The vehicle damage report of the third victim’s motorcar confirmed that there were scratches, dents on cracks on the front right portion of the motorcar. The rear right corner portion of the motorcar sustained scratches and dents and had crumpled.

65     The Defence’s argument that the damage caused to the other vehicles were more serious than they seemed because the accused was driving an S-Class Mercedes Benz which was a heavier vehicle. Since all drivers of heavy vehicles have to take extra care when driving on the roads, _a fortiori_, the accused should exercise greater caution when driving if he knew that he was driving a heavier motor vehicle.

66     As for the potential harm that could have been caused, as seen from the video footages, there were other motorists (including a motorcyclist) waiting for the traffic red light to turn green on the opposite side of the road at the material time. When the accused lost control of his motorcar and went against the flow of traffic on the opposite side, one could not exclude the possibility that the potential harm that might be caused to the other motorists and perhaps even pedestrians walking along the side of the roads can be significant. The accident location was also in a residential area.

67     Overall, I would say that the harm caused was somewhere in the lower spectrum of the moderate range.

68     All things considered, I agreed with both the Prosecution and Defence that the custodial threshold had not been crossed in the present case. At the same time, given the level of culpability and degree of harm here, I was of the view that the fine amount to be imposed should be on the higher spectrum of the sentencing range.

#### Mitigating factors

69     In coming to my decision on the appropriate fine and period of disqualification to be imposed, I gave due consideration to the accused’s remorsefulness and his early plea of guilt. I further noted that he had cooperated fully with investigations and rendered all necessary assistance to the victims.

#### The accused’s driving record

70     I would first touch on the accused’s compounded traffic violations.

71     In the past, the High Court has taken into account an offender’s compounded offence under the RTA for sentencing purpose, as there is a need to deter bad driving habits. In _Koh Thiam Huat_, See J said at \[56\] – \[57\]:

> \[56\]  In my view, an offence under the RTA (or its subsidiary legislation) which has been compounded _can_ be taken into account for sentencing purposes.

> \[57\]  In _PP v Lim Niah Liang_ \[1966\] 3 SLR(R) 702, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 18(2) and punishable under s 31(1) of the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95, 1988 Rev Ed) (“EPHA 1988”). The accused had previously compounded a similar offence, and the essential point for consideration on appeal was whether the respondent could have been properly characterised as a recalcitrant offender, such that a corrective work order should have been imposed pursuant to s 21A(1) of the EPHA 1988. Yong Pung How CJ held (at \[21\]) that:

>> In my opinion, in the context of s 21(A) of the \[EPHA, 1988\] and for the purpose of showing that an offender is “recalcitrant’, it would suffice to rely on evidence that he has previously _committed_ the same offence on at least one occasion. He need _not have been convicted_ of the offence. In the circumstances, _I did not see why evidence of a compounded offence could not be relied upon for the specific purpose of imposing a corrective work order under the \[EPHA 1988\]…_

> … \[Emphasis added in the original\]

72     Further at \[59\] – \[60\] of _Koh Thiam Huat_, it was held:

> \[59\]  Moreover, allowing a court to take into account a compounded offence under the RTA (or its subsidiary legislation) allows for a more holistic approach in sentencing. It cannot be gainsaid that a court should have regard to all relevant factors in sentencing. This is, in fact, hinted at by s 228(2)(c) of the CPC, which provides that the Prosecution’s address on sentence may include _“any_ relevant factors which may affect the sentence” \[emphasis added\] (although this provision appears to apply only to plead guilty proceedings, s 230(1)(x) of the CPC makes it applicable to trial proceedings as well). It follows that the court must be allowed to take these same factors into account.

> \[60\]  Furthermore, the offence of dangerous driving is one that calls for both specific and general deterrence (_D’Rozario Pancratius Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 46</span> at \[27\]). Allowing a court to take into account a compounded offence under the RTA (or its subsidiary legislation) gives better effect to this need. Indeed, whether a traffic offence is compounded may ultimately depend on the prevailing prosecutorial policy of the day. But the need to deter bad driving remains regardless and is better given effect to when a court is allowed to take into account compounded offences under the RTA (or its subsidiary legislation).

73     In _Aw Tai Hock_, endorsing the view in _Koh Thiam_ Huat, Chong JA said at \[28\]:

> Equally relevant is the role of specific deterrence which has been inherently built into the sentencing regime for the offence through the tiered punishment ranges. The legislative intention is clear that repeat offenders if dangerous driving should be subject to an enhanced level of punishment. In _Koh Thiam Huat_ \[18(a)\] _supra_, it was thus held (at \[60\]) that a court may also take into account compounded offence under the RTA (or its subsidiary legislation) to better give effect to the end of specific deterrence.

74     On the other hand, the High Court has also disagreed that compounded offences can be taken into consideration for sentencing purposes in the absence of legislative intervention. This is because it is wrong for the courts to assume that composition of an offence amounts to an admission of guilt. In _Neo Chuan Sheng_, Chua Lee Ming J opined at \[37\], \[39\] and \[40\] as follows:

> \[37\]  In my respectful view, it is wrong to assume that acceptance of an offer of composition is tantamount to an admission of liability. Even if an offer of composition is accepted in many instances because the offender in fact admits to the offence, the same cannot be said in respect of _all_ cases. This much was in fact acknowledged in _Koh Thiam Huat_ (at \[58\]). How is a sentencing court to decide whether a particular compounded offence amounts to an admission of guilt and can therefore be taken into consideration? It would be unsafe to simply assume so; one may accept an offer of composition purely on grounds of “Practicality and expediency” without admitting liability (_Lim Chor Pee_ (at \[56\]). Whether the compounded offence is a less serious or more serious offence is irrelevant. Apart from the ambiguity as to what constitutes a “less serious” traffic offence, the relative severity of an offence bears no rational nexus to the question as to whether that offence should be taken into account for sentencing purposes once compounded.

> …

> \[39\]  It may perhaps be argued that composition of an offence does not prohibit the Prosecution from proving that the compounded offence was committed, if this is done for the purposes of sentencing only. In my view, this cannot be correct as a matter of principle. The effect of composition is that there is an acquittal or that no further proceedings may be taken. It seems clear that once an offence has been compounded, the alleged offender can no longer be said to have committed the compounded offence. It cannot be right that the Prosecution can still seek to prove the commission of the compounded offence. In any event, leaving aside whether the Prosecution would still be able to prove the offence when evidence may have been lost with the passage of time, having to do so defeats the very purpose of composition.

> \[40\]  On a final note, the RTA was amended in 2019 to specifically provide in s 139AA that the court may consider compounded RTA offences as an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing a person convicted of an RTA offence…. In my view, the amendment to the RTA shows that the general principle that compounded offences are not relevant in sentencing should be departed from only by way of statutory intervention.

75     As s 139AA of the RTA only came into effect on 1 November 2019, it does not apply to the present case.

76     As regards to offences committed prior to 1 November 2019, there appears to be differing views from the High Court decisions mentioned. However, given that the Prosecution has requested the court to rely on the more recent decision of _Neo Chuan Sheng_ instead of the other earlier decisions, I agreed not to consider his compounded offences for the purpose of sentencing the accused here. This was also a more favourable position for the accused, to which the Defence had no objection to.

77     Pertinently, this would not affect offences committed on or after 1 November 2019 as s 139AA of the RTA states:

> For the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence for an offence committed by a person under this Act, a court may take into account, as an aggravating factor, any offence that has been compounded (whether before, on or after the date of commencement of section 21 of the Road Traffic (Amendment Act 2019) under this Act before the date of the sentencing.

78     As for the accused’s previous traffic convictions, I was unable to agree with the Defence to disregard them. Both were relevant convictions for reckless or dangerous driving under s 26(1) of the old RTA and speeding under s63(4) of the RTA respectively.

79     Nonetheless, I placed little weight on his previous traffic convictions as I accepted that they were rather dated. Otherwise, I would have given a disqualification order closer to the period that was imposed on the accused for his previous dangerous driving conviction. It must be highlighted that the accused was actually given a disqualification order for two years in respect of his Class 2 licence in 1984. This would not have been an insignificant period of disqualification at that time or even in the present day.

#### The fine and disqualification order imposed

80     All things considered, having duly examined the culpability of the accused in relation to the accident, the potential and actual harm due to the accident and any mitigating or aggravating factor, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $4,500.

81     As mentioned earlier, due to the level of culpability and harm caused by the accused as a result of the accident, I agreed with the Prosecution that the fine amount to be imposed should be on the higher end of the spectrum. Thus, I was of the view that the submission of a $3,000 fine by the Defence was manifestly inadequate in the circumstances. Besides, its submission was inconsistent with the authorities submitted by the Defence.

82     As for the duration of the disqualification order, I had to consider both the aspects of general and specific deterrence vis-à-vis the accused by taking him off the roads for a certain period in the interest of public safety. Significantly, a disqualification period of 12 months or more would require the offender to take his or her driving test again: See s 43(1) of the RTA.

83     In determining the appropriate duration of the disqualification, it was emphasized by Chua J in _Neo Chuan Sheng_ at \[19\] and \[20\]:

> \[19\]  In deciding on the appropriate period of disqualification, it must first be borne in mind that the disqualification order and the fine imposed are not mutually compensatory; an increase in the quantum of the fine imposed should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced period of disqualification than would otherwise have been ordered: _Edwin Nathan_ at \[13\]. The fact that the fine imposed in this case was close to the maximum provided for under s 64(1) RTA was therefore not a reason to reduce the period of disqualification.

> \[20\]  Next, it is clear that the period of disqualification should increase in tandem with the severity of the offence: _Edwin Nathan_ at \[14\]….

84     Here, for the reasons stated above, I agreed with the Prosecution that the disqualification period of 12 months was unequivocally necessary as a matter of both general and specific deterrence. There was a beating of the red light where both actual personal and property damage were caused. On top of that, even though the accused was considered a first offender under s 64(1) of the RTA, he did have similar and relevant previous convictions. It was certainly, to my mind, not manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I disagreed with the Defence’s argument that _Neo Chuan Sheng_ should be followed on the facts.

85     In _Neo Chuan Sheng_, there was no actual injury or damage caused unlike the present case. The High Court in _Neo Chuan Sheng_ also determined potential harm there to be low (See \[41\]). I was of the view that the level of harm (both actual and potential) in the present case was plainly greater than that in _Neo Chuan Sheng_ even if I was prepared to accept that the degree of culpability might be similar in both cases at medium.

86     Another point to note was that in _Neo Chuan Sheng_, the previous convictions of the accused were for dissimilar type of traffic offences from his latest offence of dangerous driving. They were convictions for driving whilst underage and without insurance coverage. Here, the accused’s previous convictions were for similar type of traffic offences which dealt directly with an offender’s manner of driving. They were convictions for dangerous driving and speeding respectively. On the whole, I was of the view that there was a need for a longer disqualification order so as to give the full effect of deterrence in the present case as compared to _Neo Chuan Sheng_.

87     Ultimately, the authorities submitted by the Defence did not support its submission that a disqualification period of six months was warranted on the facts. This, in my view, would have been woefully inadequate in any event even if the offender had been untraced.

## Conclusion

88     To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="37.66%"> <col width="62.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence Ordered</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TP191015408111</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of <b>$4,500</b>, in default 18 days’ imprisonment.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of <b>12 months with effect from 6 July 2020</b>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

89     As the accused did not apply for a stay of the disqualification order pending appeal, the accused has been serving out the disqualification order imposed on him since 6 July 2020.
