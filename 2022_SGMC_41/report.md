Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Striking out – Default of pre-action protocol

13 July 2022

### Deputy Registrar Lewis Tan:

1       Procedural rules are handmaidens of justice (_Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 537</span> at \[63\], citing _Lea Tool and Moulding Industries Pte Ltd v CGU International Insurance plc_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 745</span> at \[16\]). Their importance cannot be understated, and while it is substantive law that “occupies the throne, … one must climb the steps of procedure if he is to pluck the crown” (_Edmund Tie & Co (SEA) Pte Ltd v Savills Residential Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 349</span> at \[13\]).

2       Of the many procedural steps that can be taken during the lifeblood of a civil suit, seeking a striking out order pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Ed) (“ROC 2014”) is one of the most draconian. As such, the court’s striking out jurisdiction is jealously guarded, and is only invoked in “plain and obvious cases” (_Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others_ \[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 648 at \[18\] and _The “Osprey”_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 1099</span> at \[6\]).

3       In this case, the Plaintiff was incensed with allegedly defamatory comments that the Defendant had made on the latter’s Facebook business account. A letter of demand was sent to the Defendant, seeking damages and an apology for the remarks. This letter of demand was however inconsistent with the format provided in Form 1 of the Pre-Action Protocol for Defamation Actions (“Pre-Action Protocol”), as found in Appendix K of the State Court’s Practice Directions. The Defendant responded through her counsel that she would “not be addressing the contents of \[the letter of demand\]” until the Pre-Action Protocol was complied with. The Plaintiff perceived this response as intimating an unwillingness to resolve the matter expeditiously, and accordingly initiated the present action, claiming damages. Again, there was a procedural lapse on the Plaintiff’s part, as the Statement of Claim was filed without the Pre-Action Protocol Checklist found in Form 5 of Appendix K.

4       Faced with the purportedly “flagrant and total disregard” of the Pre-Action Protocol, the Defendant filed a summons to strike out the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim for being an abuse of process, pursuant to O 18 r 19(1)(_d_) of ROC 2014. Counsel for the Defendant, Mr Lee Wee Peng Lawrence (“Mr Lee”), submitted that such a sanction was necessary, as a mere costs order against the Plaintiff would create a “bad precedent”.

5       However, Mr Lee was unable to point to any authority whereby the court has struck out a matter due to a breach of a pre-action protocol. A survey of the authorities shows that such breaches can result in adverse costs orders against the defaulting party (see, _eg, Vishva Protech Pvt Ltd v Pacific Pharmaceuticals Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 49</span> at \[8\]), and in the appropriate case, such costs orders may be made on an indemnity basis (see _Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd v PH Hydraulics & Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 103</span> at \[18\], referring to O 59 r 5(_d_) of ROC 2014).

6       That is not to say that breaches of procedural rules will never be sufficient to justify the invocation of the striking out jurisdiction of the court. But the application of the abuse of process doctrine “must necessarily be premised on a proper balancing exercise to prevent the greater risk of injustice” (_BWG v BWF_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 1296</span> at \[5\]), and the balance in this case clearly tended against the making of an order for striking out pursuant to O 18 r 19(1)(_d_) of ROC 2014. As recently observed in _Fu Yuan Construction Pte Ltd v Fab-5 Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHCR 2</span> at \[30\]–\[31\], “a breach of a procedural rule does not, in and of itself, amount to abuse of process” and “where the \[party’s\] offending conduct is in the nature of a default of a procedural rule stipulated in the Rules of Court, the court would be remiss in its judgment if it were to make a quantum leap and equate such default as amounting to an abuse of process of the court”.

7       The breaches here amounted simply to a failure by the Plaintiff to abide by the format in Form 1 of the Pre-Action Protocol, and to file Form 5 of the same protocol with its Statement of Claim. Such defaults did not cause substantive prejudice to the Defendant because the Plaintiff’s letter of demand nonetheless set out the details of the offending words and why they were defamatory, as well as the damage caused and remedies sought. Therefore, while non-compliant in form, the letter of demand was _in substance_ in accordance with Form 1, and the Defendant had been given due notice of the claim to be made against her. As regards the failure to file Form 5 with the Statement of Claim, this could be easily remedied given the early stage of the proceedings whereby the Defence had not even been filed.

8       Despite this, the Defendant opted for the nuclear option, and Mr Lee insisted that the breaches of the Pre-Action Protocol warranted a striking out. He also proposed a circuitous route whereby the Plaintiff was to commence fresh proceedings, and to re-file and re-serve its Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim, upon compliance with the Pre-Action Protocol. This would not only result in a waste of time and costs for the Plaintiff but would also entail a wastage of the court’s resources as two identical suits would have to be taken out simply to ensure compliance with the Pre-Action Protocol.

9       In any case, paragraph 8.1 of the Pre-Action Protocol provides that breaches of the protocol can result in adverse costs orders against the defaulting party, and this in my view was a more than proportionate response here. To allow the striking out on the basis of remediable breaches that caused little to no substantive prejudice to the non-defaulting party would, to borrow Mr Lee’s words, create a “bad precedent” whereby strict compliance of the Pre-Action Protocol would be required before claims for defamation in the State Courts may proceed. That would not only be unduly prohibitive and stringent but would also stand afoul of the high threshold required for invoking the court’s striking out jurisdiction. As mentioned, Mr Lee could not provide any authority in support of such a stark proposition.

10     I therefore dismissed the striking out application without hesitation. As regards costs, while oral arguments took less than 30 minutes, I agreed with counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Siew Wei Ying, Silas (“Mr Siew”), that there was little basis for the Defendant’s application. The law was clear that the threshold for striking out is high, and despite the Plaintiff’s well-reasoned written submissions, the Defendant’s position remained unwavering even though Mr Lee could not produce any authorities in support. Considering that this was a Magistrate’s Court Suit and given the work done in resisting the application, costs was fixed at $1,300 (all-in), to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. This was scaled down from Mr Siew’s submission of $1,500 to account for the procedural defaults of the Pre-Action Protocol by the Plaintiff.
