24 September 2020

### District Judge Samuel Hwa Kuan Chua:

1       The Accused is Mok Chek Meng, presently a 40-year-old male Singapore citizen. He was initially tried on one charge under section 7(1)(a) r/w section 10(1) Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CMA”). At the start of the second tranche on 13 July 2020, the Prosecution amended the charge to section 7(1)(b) r/w section 10(1) CMA. The Accused was tried on the amended charge for the remainder of the trial.

2       The amended charge states:

> You … are charged that you, on the 13th day of June 2019, in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with Nurharyadi (FIN: XXX) to impair the usefulness of data stored in a computer, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, to wit, Nurharyadi attached a magnet on the Mass Flow Meter (“**MFM**”) onboard Singapore tanker “Fragrance”, while it was delivering marine fuel to a vessel the “Southern Glory”, thereby causing the Human Machine Interface Data Logger (“**HMI Data Logger**”), a computer connected to the MFM onboard “Fragrance”, to erroneously record that 4.24 more metric tons of marine fuel was delivered to the “Southern Glory” than what was actually delivered over approximately 1 hour and 18 minutes, which act took place with your knowledge and which you knew would impair the usefulness of the data stored in the HMI Data Logger without lawful excuse, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 7(1)(b) read with Section 10(1) of the Computer Misuse Act, Chapter 50A. (_sic._)

3       The Prosecution called nine witnesses to prove its case. At the end of the Prosecution’s case, I called on the Accused to give his defence under section 230(1)(j) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). The Accused gave his defence and did not call any other witnesses to testify in his defence.

## Undisputed Facts

4       Throughout the trial, the Accused accepted that he was the bunker clerk on duty onboard “Fragrance” on 13 June 2019 while it was delivering marine fuel to a vessel “Southern Glory” within Singapore’s territorial waters, and that Nurharyadi had attached a magnet on the Mass Flow Meter (“MFM”) onboard “Fragrance” during the said delivery. The Accused also accepted that the attachment of the magnet on the MFM caused the Human Machine Interface Data Logger (“HMI Data Logger”), a computer connected to the MFM onboard “Fragrance”, to erroneously record that 4.24 more metric tons of marine fuel was delivered to “Southern Glory” than what was actually delivered over approximately one hour and 18 minutes. The Accused further accepted that the value of the 4.24 metric tons of marine fuel was USD 1,602.72 (equivalent to SGD 2,174.17 as at the date of full payment on 15 July 2019).

## Disputed Facts

5       The Accused disputed that:

> (a)     He had on 13 June 2019 engaged in a conspiracy with Nurharyadi to impair the usefulness of data stored in the HMI Data Logger onboard “Fragrance”;

> (b)     It was pursuant to the conspiracy that Nurharyadi had on 13 June 2019 attached the magnet on the MFM;

> (c)     Nurharyadi had attached the said magnet on the MFM with his knowledge; and

> (d)     He knew that the attachment of the magnet on the MFM would impair the usefulness of the data stored in the HMI Data Logger.

## Summary of the Prosecution’s Case

## Nurharyadi

6       Nurharyadi had been working as an Assistant Bosun onboard “Fragrance” since April 2019. Prior to that, he had worked on the same vessel for two years, when it was named “Consort Justice”.[^1] Nurharyadi referred to the grey U-shaped pipe on the deck of “Fragrance” which formed part of the MFM system as “pipe U”.[^2] His job as an Assistant Bosun was to conduct manual sounding of the fuel tanks onboard “Fragrance” after every bunker operation and to report the results of the manual sounding to the bunker clerk on duty. While the fuel was being delivered, he checked the pressure at the deck and stood by the emergency pump at the deck.[^3] According to Nurharyadi, sounding was done to measure the depth of the marine fuel remaining in the tanks by using the sounding meter.[^4] After every bunker operation, he was also required to report the reading on the MFM system to the bunker clerk on duty, which reading was found in the computer in the Computer Control Room (“CCR”).[^5]

7       Nurharyadi identified the Accused as “Jordan” and testified that the Accused was the bunker clerk on duty onboard “Fragrance” on 13 June 2019.[^6] Nurharyadi testified that the Accused had instructed him to put the magnet on the “pipe U” during the delivery of the fuel to “Southern Glory”, after the delivery pump was started.[^7] The Accused had also instructed him to take off the magnet from the “pipe U” and to throw away the magnet if there were Maritime Port Authority (“MPA”) officers around.[^8]

8       On 13 June 2019, about five minutes after the pumping started, Nurharyadi put the magnet on the “pipe U”.[^9] Just after finishing his lunch, Nurharyadi saw the MPA vessel alongside “Fragrance”.[^10] When Nurharyadi saw MPA officer Abdul Aziz Bin Ismail (“Aziz”) boarding “Fragrance”, he took off the magnet from the “pipe U”. Thereafter, he hid the magnet in a wooden box on the deck as he did not have time to throw it away.[^11] When Nurharyadi informed the Accused that MPA was coming, the Accused asked Nurharyadi whether the magnet had been thrown away. Nurharyadi said “Yes” but did not tell the Accused where he had thrown the magnet.[^12]

9       Nurharyadi testified that the Accused had simply ordered him to put the magnet on the “pipe U” and to throw away the magnet should MPA officers come onboard, without telling him why he had to put the magnet on the “pipe U” and why he had to throw away the magnet. Nobody had taught him to put the magnet on the “pipe U’ and that he had simply placed it there.[^13] He also did not get any monetary reward for placing the magnet on the “pipe U”.[^14]

10     Upon boarding “Fragrance”, Aziz asked Nurharyadi where the magnet was. Nurharyadi replied that the magnet was in the wooden box and led Aziz to the magnet.[^15] Aziz also asked Nurharyadi where he was supposed to install the magnet and who had instructed him to do so.[^16] Subsequently, after about 30 minutes to an hour, the Police Coast Guard (“PCG”) officers arrived at “Fragrance” and similarly asked Nurharyadi where he was supposed to install the magnet and who had instructed him to do so. Nurharyadi admitted to Aziz and the PCG officers that it was the Accused who had instructed him to install the magnet on the “pipe U”.[^17] When the PCG officers asked Nurharyadi whether he knew the function of the magnet, he replied that he was not sure whether it would increase the meter reading and that they should ask “the boss, Mr Jordan”.[^18] When asked what would happen to him if he did not place the magnet on the “pipe U” as the Accused had instructed, Nurharyadi testified that maybe he would be sacked. He further testified that if the Accused, as the bunker clerk, had not instructed him to place the magnet on the “pipe U”, he would not have done so on his own accord.[^19]

11     Nurharyadi testified that 13 June 2019 was the first time that he had placed the magnet on the “pipe U” and that he was supposed to place the magnet on the “pipe U” for one hour.[^20] He had attached the magnet to the “pipe U” by using the grey duct tape that was already stuck onto the magnet when he took it from its storage place above a wooden board on the deck, which was situated higher than his height of 157 centimetres.[^21]

12     As bunker clerk, the Accused was in charge of calculating the quantity of marine fuel involved in the pumping, and Nurharyadi was not aware of how the calculations were done.[^22] He did not know that placing the magnet on the “pipe U” would increase the pumping rate of the MFM.[^23] When asked how he knew which part of the “pipe U” to place the magnet on, Nurharyadi testified that he did not know but that after he had placed the magnet on the “pipe U”, the Accused checked something in the CCR.[^24] The Accused did not tell Nurharyadi whether his checks in the CCR following the placement of the magnet on the “pipe U” showed that the meter “runs good or not”. Neither did Nurharyadi ask the Accused about it.[^25]

## Abdul Aziz Bin Ismail

13     Abdul Aziz Bin Ismail was working as a Port Inspector with the MPA at the material time. His job scope comprised attending to marine incidents, collecting oil samples from vessels and doing enforcement work on vessels, including checking for the manning licence and compliance with regulations.[^26]

14     On 13 June 2019, at about 4pm, Aziz was on duty when he saw “Fragrance” and “Southern Glory” doing bunkering operations. “Fragrance” was on MPA’s list of vessels for oil samples to be collected. “Fragrance” was also targeted by MPA as it had engaged in malpractice when it was previously named “Consort Justice”.[^27] Aziz approached “Fragrance” in the MPA vessel. While approaching “Fragrance”, Aziz saw Nurharyadi and another crew member at the mid-ship of “Fragrance”. Aziz then saw Nurharyadi at the back of the MFM, removing an object and acting very suspiciously. Aziz observed Nurharyadi climbing up and down a bench twice, moving to the portside of “Fragrance”, going to the back of “Fragrance” and returning to the mid-ship, where Aziz met him.[^28] Aziz asked Nurharyadi what he had removed behind the MFM. Nurhayadi admitted to Aziz that he had removed a magnet and had thrown the magnet inside a wooden crate on the deck of “Fragrance”.[^29] Nurharyadi then showed Aziz the wooden crate, and the oil sample bottle which the magnet was contained in.[^30]

15     At about 4.20pm, Aziz telephoned his control centre to activate PCG for assistance.[^31] Aziz asked Nurharyadi where he had placed the magnet and who had instructed him to do so. Nurharyadi admitted that he had placed the magnet on the MFM but did not know what the magnet would do to the MFM readings. He admitted that the bunker clerk (later identified to be the Accused) had instructed him to do so.[^32]

16     While Aziz was waiting for PCG’s arrival at “Fragrance”, the Accused identified himself to Aziz as the bunker clerk. When Aziz confronted the Accused with Nurharyadi’s admission that he had instructed Nurharyadi to place the magnet on the MFM, the Accused denied knowing about the magnet.[^33] Aziz instructed the Accused to stop the bunkering operation and to wait for further instructions.[^34]

17     At about 4.45pm when the PCG patrol officers arrived at “Fragrance”, Aziz removed the oil sample bottle and the magnet from the wooden crate in their presence.[^35] Aziz then showed the PCG officers where on the MFM Nurharyadi had placed the magnet. In the process, the magnet became stuck onto the metal staircase.[^36]

## Helmi Bin Mohamed Ali

18     Helmi Bin Mohamed Ali (“Helmi”) was a police officer attached to PCG’s investigation branch at the material time.[^37] On 13 June 2019, at about 5pm plus, PCG (it remained unclear whether it was the PCG operations room or the PCG investigation team) received a call about a magnet being found onboard “Fragrance”. Subsequently, Helmi, Senior Investigation Officer Tan Seong Yuet Randy (“Randy Tan”) and Assistant Investigation Officer Muhammad Zamakhsyarii (“Zamakhsyarii”) proceeded to “Fragrance” together with officers from the Criminal Investigation Department’s (“CID’s”) forensic crime unit.[^38] Helmi met Aziz onboard “Fragrance” and Aziz informed Helmi that Nurharyadi had been caught using a magnet onboard “Fragrance”. Aziz informed Helmi that when he boarded “Fragrance”, he found that Nurharyadi had thrown the magnet into a wooden crate. Aziz and Nurharyadi showed Helmi the crate where the magnet had been thrown into.[^39] Helmi interviewed Nurharyadi separately about how long he had been onboard “Fragrance”, what he had done and what had happened. Nurharyadi told Helmi that when he came out of the toilet, he saw the MPA vessel alongside “Fragrance”. Nurharyadi then ran towards the MFM, took off the magnet and disposed the magnet into the wooden crate.[^40] Nurharyadi brought Helmi to the wooden crate and claimed that the Accused, who was the bunker clerk on duty, had instructed him to place the magnet on the MFM.[^41] Nurharyadi informed Helmi that the Accused was on the left side of “Fragrance” near “Southern Glory” when MPA boarded “Fragrance”.[^42]

19     Helmi went to Cabin 1 to look for the Accused and observed him smoking cigarette after cigarette. Helmi also observed that the Accused’s hand was “a bit shaky” and that the Accused was “very nervous”.[^43] Helmi interviewed the Accused, whereupon the Accused claimed that he did not know anything about the magnet being found onboard “Fragrance”.[^44] Helmi checked the Accused’s belongings and found SGD 3,099 in his black sling bag. The Accused informed Helmi that his girlfriend had given him the SGD 3,099 cash but did not state the purpose for which she had given him the large amount of cash.[^45] Helmi asked the Accused for his mobile phone, to which the Accused informed Helmi that he had dropped his mobile phone into the sea while helping to pull the gangway on the left side of “Fragrance”.[^46] Helmi interviewed a crew by the name of Waskanah, who informed Helmi that when MPA officers boarded “Fragrance”, the Accused had borrowed his mobile phone to call someone. Helmi took down the number and gave it to the Investigation Officer for tracing.[^47] The Accused informed Helmi that he had called his girlfriend when MPA officers boarded “Fragrance”.[^48] Helmi and his team then arrested the Accused and Nurharyadi.[^49]

## Randy Tan Seong Yuet

20     Randy Tan Seong Yuet (“Randy”) was a senior Investigation Officer with PCG’s investigation branch at the material time. On 13 June 2019, at about 4.45pm, Randy arrived at “Fragrance” together with his colleagues from PCG and CID’s forensic unit.[^50] Randy obtained a summary of the case from Aziz and interviewed Nurharyadi thereafter. Nurharyadi admitted that he had placed the magnet on the MFM earlier. When he saw the MPA vessel approaching “Fragrance”, he became nervous. He wanted to throw the magnet into the sea from the left side of “Fragrance” but did not do so as he was afraid that the magnet would stick to the hull of “Southern Glory”.[^51] Nurharyadi also admitted to Randy that the magnet would not stick onto the MFM, which was why a tape was needed to attach the magnet to the MFM.[^52] Randy testified that Aziz did a re-enactment earlier, during which the magnet became stuck onto a metal staircase. Nurharyadi then brought Randy to the staircase, where Randy saw the magnet for the first time. Nurharyadi assisted Randy in pulling the magnet off the metal staircase.[^53] After interviewing Nurharyadi, Randy asked him to re-enact the whole incident and showed what he did when MPA officers arrived at “Fragrance”. Nurharyadi showed Randy that he was standing near the MFM. When he saw the MPA vessel approaching “Fragrance”, he removed the magnet and wanted to throw the magnet into the sea from the left side of “Fragrance”. He hesitated because he knew that the magnet would stick on the hull of “Southern Glory”. As such, Nurharyadi continued running towards the tower of “Fragrance”. By this time the MPA vessel had already berthed and Aziz was about to board “Fragrance”. Nurharyadi didn’t know what to do and dumped the magnet into the wooden crate.[^54]

21     After the re-enactment, Randy instructed the crew of “Fragrance” to flush out the fuel pipes with air, so that all fuel remaining in the pipes would be discharged into “Southern Glory” and the crew of “Southern Glory” would be in a position to finalise the actual amount of fuel that had been transferred from “Fragrance”.[^55] After the flushing, Randy went onboard “Southern Glory”, where the crew of “Southern Glory” performed manual sounding of their fuel tanks to determine the actual amount of fuel that “Southern Glory” had received from “Fragrance”.[^56] Thereafter, Randy and the crew from “Southern Glory” went to the CCR on “Fragrance”, where they printed out the receipt from the MFM, which showed that 573.406 metric tonnes of marine fuel had been delivered from “Fragrance” to “Southern Glory”.[^57]

22     After this, Randy went to the Accused’s cabin to interview him and observed that the cabin was filled with smoke. The Accused told Randy that “Fragrance” was a “losing vessel” but did not elaborate further.[^58] Randy allowed the Accused to complete the documentation for the marine fuel that ‘Fragrance” had supplied to “Southern Glory”, including preparation of the Bunker Delivery Note. Thereafter. Randy and his team placed the Accused and Nurharyadi under arrest, and seized the magnet and the SGD 3,099 which had been found in the Accused’s sling bag.[^59] Randy testified that the officers from “Southern Glory” came down to “Fragrance” together with him after they had completed the manual sounding of the fuel tanks on “Southern Glory”, as they needed to verify the manual sounding readings against the MFM reading onboard “Fragrance”.[^60]

## Aw Woon Liang

23     Aw Woon Liang (“Aw”) was working as a marine fuel trader at Inter-Pacific Petroleum Pte Ltd (“IPP”) in June 2019, selling fuel to trading houses that in turn sold the fuel to end customers.[^61] Aw confirmed that on 15 July 2019, IPP received full payment of USD 216,747.47 for the supply of 573.406 metric tonnes of Marine Fuel Oil 380CST to “Southern Glory” on 13 June 2019.[^62]

## Tay Tien Whui Jason

24     At the material time on 13 June 2019, Tay Tien Whui Jason (“Tay”) was a director of three companies, namely, Success Energy, Ocean Express Services and Gast Maritime. His companies provided cargo officers and operations services to the bunker industry.[^63] Ocean Express Services had employed the Accused as one of their bunker clerks. Tay testified that he had allowed his employees to use magnets onboard the vessels to assist him to cut losses but after the Southernpec case, he had briefed his employees to not have such magnets onboard the vessels as it was illegal to use them.[^64] Tay believed that the use of the magnets would increase the volume of fuel that was recorded by the MFM as compared to the actual volume that was supplied and measured through manual sounding. Tay did not know where the magnet should be placed in order for it to achieve its intended effect.[^65].

25     In the afternoon of 13 June 2019, Tay received a telephone call from the Accused using another person’s mobile phone. The Accused informed Tay that MPA officers had found a magnet onboard “Fragrance”. The Accused told Tay that he did not know what was happening as he was sleeping in his cabin. Tay instructed the Accused to find out what was happening. Tay didn’t receive any updates from the Accused thereafter.[^66]

## Benjamin Swisher

26     From 2017 to June 2020, Benjamin Swisher (“Swisher”) worked in the Singapore office of Emerson Automation Solutions (“Emerson”) as Director of Marketing. He then took up the appointment of Vice-President of Marketing for Coriolis, based in Boulder, Colorado, United States of America. Emerson manufactured the Coriolis flow and density measurement device that was installed onboard “Fragrance” as at 13 June 2019.

27     Swisher testified that:

> “4.2  Data Logging: The Human Machine Interface (“HMI”) Data Logger is connected to the Coriolis Flow Meter. Data from the Coriolis Flow Meter is logged and stored in the HMI Data Logger. To put simply, the HMI Data Logger is a computer that records and stores information from the Coriolis Flow Meter. During a bunkering operation to deliver fuel, mass flow rate can be monitored through the HMI Data Logger. If there is an external interference to the Coriolis Flow Meter, it will affect the readings and data recorded on the HMI Data Logger.

> 4.3    Data Security: The HMI Data Logger is password protected, and data from the HMI can be exported via a secured and dedicated USB. The HMI Data Logger is installed in the cargo control room, wheelhouse, or ship’s office of a bunker tanker The data recorded and stored on the HMI Data Logger contains all the data obtained from the Bunker Mass Flow Meter system. The records include history of operations batches, and critical alarms for future reference. The data is secured to prevent tampering and is required to be kept onboard for a minimum of 3 months.”

28     Swisher further testified that upon assessing 28 files containing Coriolis flow meter data for 28 bills of lading flow profiles, Emerson found five instances of unauthorised interference with the operation of the Coriolis flow meter onboard “Fragrance”, where the interference was likely due to the placing of an industrial strength magnet on the flow meter to tamper with the flow meter. The five instances were as follows:

> (a)     During a bunkering operation that started from 8am on 27 May 2019 for a duration of 2.7 hours, the magnet was applied for 1.65 hours, with the amount of increase due to the magnet estimated at 10.89 tonnes.

> (b)     During a bunkering operation that started from 12.02am on 28 May 2019 for a duration of 6.1 hours, the magnet was applied for 4.94 hours, with the amount of increase due to the magnet unascertained due to flow instability.

> (c)     During a bunkering operation that started from 1.28pm on 10 June 2019 for a duration of 3.3 hours, the magnet was applied for 2.24 hours, with the amount of increase due to the magnet unascertained due to flow instability.

> (d)     During a bunkering operation that started from 9.44pm on 10 June 2019 for a duration of 7.6 hours, the magnet was applied for 3.88 hours, with the amount of increase due to the magnet estimated at 10.41 tonnes.

> (e)     During a bunkering operation that started from 2.33pm on 13 June 2019 for a duration of 4.7 hours, the magnet was applied for 1.31 hours, with the amount of increase due to the magnet estimated at 4.24 tonnes.

29     According to Emerson’s report at Annex 4 of Swisher’s conditioned statement, “A Coriolis flowmeter includes a steel case protecting the flow tubes and the pickoffs. The steel case also eliminates interference with the pickoffs from all of the typical hazards in flow metering applications. Because of the steel case, tampering with the flowmeter would require an industrial strength magnet, specific knowledge of where to place a magnet, and access to the meter to install and remove the magnet. To our knowledge, there is no other external influence which would account for these instances of interference other than the likely malicious use of magnets.”

30     Swisher’s testimony as contained in his conditioned statement and the reports that were annexed to it was not disputed by the Accused.

31     The Accused’s entry and exit records at the Marina South Pier and West Coast Pier, where he did his immigration clearance whenever he departed from the mainland to board “Fragrance” or returned to the mainland upon disembarking “Fragrance”, were admitted into evidence as agreed facts between the Prosecution and the Defence. The records showed that for four out of the five bunkering operations in which the industrial strength magnet was applied to the MFM, the Accused was likely to have been onboard “Fragrance” either throughout the operation, or part of the operation:

> (a)     In respect of the bunkering operation that started at 8am on 27 May 2019 for a duration of 2.7 hours (i.e. it ended at 10.42am on 27 May 2019), the Accused had gone out to sea from Marina South Pier at 3.13am on 27 May 2019 and returned to land at Marina South Pier only at 1.09am on 28 May 2019.

> (b)     In respect of the bunkering operation that started from 12.02am on 28 May 2019 for a duration of 6.1 hours (i.e. it ended at 6.08am on 28 May 2019), the Accused had gone out to sea from Marina South Pier at 3.13am on 27 May 2019, returned to land at Marina South Pier at 1.09am on 28 May 2019, and gone out to sea again from Marina South Pier at 4.42am on 28 May 2019. He returned to land at Marina South Pier only at 12.05pm on 28 May 2019.

> (c)     In respect of the bunkering operation that started from 9.44pm on 10 June 2019 for a duration of 7.6 hours (i.e. it ended at 5.20am on 11 June 2019), the Accused had gone out to sea from West Coast Pier at 1.24am on 11 June 2019. He returned to land at Marina South Pier only at 4.52pm on 11 June 2019.

> (d)     In respect of the bunkering operation that started from 2.33pm on 13 June 2019 for a duration of 4.7 hours (i.e. it ended at 7.15pm on 13 June 2019), the Accused had gone out to sea from Marina South Pier at 11.31am on 13 June 2019, and remained onboard “Fragrance” until his arrest.

## Summary of the Accused’s Defence

32     The Accused gave evidence in his defence.

33     The Accused’s defence at trial and in his long statement was one of bare denial. He denied that he had entered into a conspiracy with Nurharyadi on 13 June 2019 to place the magnet on the MFM onboard “Fragrance” in order to cause the HMI Data Logger to record a higher volume of marine fuel than what “Fragrance” was actually supplying to “Southern Glory”. He denied knowing that there was a magnet onboard “Fragrance” on 13 June 2019. He also denied knowing where on the MFM the magnet needed to be placed in order to achieve the intended effect of recording a higher volume of marine fuel being supplied to “Southern Glory”.

34     In respect of the three previous occasions on which the magnet was applied to the MFM while the Accused was on duty, the Accused claimed that he had spent significant amounts of time waiting for vessels to ferry him between the pier and “Fragrance”, which followed that he was either not onboard “Fragrance” or had spent less time on “Fragrance” than was suggested by the Prosecution.

## Calling of additional witnesses by the Prosecution

35     At the closing submissions stage, the Prosecution applied under section 283 CPC to call two additional witnesses to testify at the trial, namely, PCG patrol officers Muhamad Firdaus Bin Abdul Rani (“Firdaus”) and Muhammad Azari Bin Hashim (“Azari”). The Defence had no objections to the Prosecution’s application. I allowed the application on the basis that the evidence of these two witnesses was essential to properly account for the sequence of events on 13 June 2019, and assisted the Court in determining the accuracy and veracity of the testimonies of the other Prosecution witnesses and the Accused.

36     Firdaus was a police officer attached to PCG’s Brani Base as an assistant crew commander.[^67] His duties included going out to sea with his crew to do patrols and to check on vessels.[^68] On 13 June 2019, at about 4.39pm, while he and his crew were patrolling sea area “Mike 7”, the PCG operations room radioed Firdaus and informed him of a Marine Gas Oil case onboard “Fragrance” that was reported by a port inspector.[^69] Firdaus and his teammate, Full-time National Service Special Constable Mohana Velu (“Mohana”), located “Fragrance” and boarded “Fragrance” at about 4.45pm.[^70] Upon boarding “Fragrance”, Firdaus met Aziz, who informed him that he (Aziz) had observed Nurharyadi standing behind the MFM and had thereafter followed behind Nurharyadi as Nurharyadi walked to the wooden crate and disposed something into the wooden crate.[^71] Together with Firdaus, Aziz retraced the path that Nurharyadi had allegedly taken from behind the MFM to the wooden crate.[^72] Nurharyadi was already standing at the wooden crate when Firdaus arrived at the crate with Aziz.[^73] Firdaus saw in the wooden crate the plastic container that was used to contain the magnet, but the magnet was no longer in the plastic container.[^74] Aziz led Firdaus to the metal staircase, where Firdaus saw the magnet stuck onto the frame of the metal staircase.[^75] Firdaus could not remember Aziz’s account to him of what had taken place from the time Aziz saw the magnet in the plastic container in the wooden crate to the time the magnet became stuck onto the metal staircase.[^76] Firdaus radioed his operations room to activate the Investigation Officers to proceed to “Fragrance” to conduct investigations.[^77] Firdaus and Mohana then secured the scene by ensuring that no one left “Fragrance” and no one touched anything, especially the magnet.[^78] Firdaus testified that he did not communicate with Nurharyadi or the Accused,[^79] and spoke only to Aziz before the arrival of the PCG Investigation Officers, who arrived at 6.50pm.[^80] At about 9.00pm, Firdaus and Mohana handed over their duties to the night shift team, and left “Fragrance” thereafter.[^81] Firdaus could not remember when the gangway leading from “Southern Glory” to “Fragrance” was lowered, and whether any crew from “Southern Glory” had boarded “Fragrance”.[^82]

37     Azari was a police officer attached to PCG’s Brani Base as a patrol officer.[^83] On 13 June 2019, while he was patrolling sea area “Mike 7” as part of his night shift duty, he was despatched to “Fragrance” to take over duties from Firdaus and Mohana.[^84] At about 9.09pm, Azari and Full-time National Service Special Constable Al-Fatih arrived at “Fragrance”.[^85] He met the three Investigation Officers and Firdaus.[^86] Azari took over the escort duties from Firdaus who was keeping watch over the Accused in his cabin, while Al-Fatih took over the escort duties from Mohana who was keeping watch over Nurharyadi.[^87] At about 10.20pm, Azari and Al-Fatih were instructed to bring the Accused and Nurharyadi back to Brani Base.[^88]

## Analysis of the Evidence

38     In **_Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_** <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[76\], the Court of Appeal set out the essential elements of abetment by conspiracy:

> (a)     First, the person abetting must engage, with one or more persons, in a conspiracy;

> (b)     Second, the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and

> (c)     Third, an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.

39     Agreement is the basic element in conspiracy. The idea of an agreement entails a meeting of minds, a mutual understanding between the alleged conspirators of what is to be done: see **_Hwa Lai Heng Ricky v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 195</span> per Yong CJ at \[32\].

40     In **_Er Joo Nguang v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 756</span> at \[35\], Yong CJ held that:

> “So far as proof goes, conspiracy is generally a matter of inference, deduced from certain acts of the accused parties, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them. Both the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties before and after the alleged commission of the crime will be useful in drawing an inference of conspiracy ... An inference of conspiracy would be justified only if it is inexorable and irresistible, and accounts for all the facts of the case.”

41     The High Court in **_Goh Kah Heng (alias Shi Ming Yi) v PP and another matter_** <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 258</span> at \[40\] noted that:

> “Proof of an agreement between the parties can be inferred from the words and actions of the parties, as elaborated upon in _PP v Yeo Choon Poh \[_1993\] 3 SLR(R) 302 at \[20\]. I quote:

>> One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.”

42     As summarised at \[5\] above, the only issues that were disputed during the trial were whether the Accused had engaged in a conspiracy with Nurharyadi to impair the usefulness of data stored in the HMI Data Logger onboard “Fragrance” and whether Nurharyadi had, with the Accused’s knowledge, thereafter attached the magnet to the MFM pursuant to that conspiracy.

43     In light of the Accused’s bare denial and the absence of direct evidence to implicate the Accused, the evidence of any conspiracy between the Accused and Nurharyadi, and the substance of that conspiracy, rested solely on Nurharyadi’s testimony, and the inferences that could be drawn from the words and actions of Nurharyadi and the Accused on 13 June 2019. Notwithstanding that Nurharyadi’s testimony that the Accused had instructed him to attach the magnet to the MFM on 13 June 2019 was corroborated by the testimonies of Aziz, Helmi and Randy on what Nurharyadi had admitted to them when they boarded “Fragrance”, it remained that these admissions still originated from Nurharyadi.

44     In assessing Nurharyadi’s evidence in the context of all the evidence that was adduced during the trial, I was mindful of the Court of Appeal’s decision in **_PP v GCK_** <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> at \[104\] and \[149\]:

> 104    In the circumstances, we answer the Applicable Standard Question as such:

>> **\[Answer\]** The “unusually convincing” standard applies to the uncorroborated evidence of a witness in all offences (and not just sexual offences), where such evidence forms the sole basis for a conviction. In principle, the standard applies regardless of whether the witness is an eyewitness or an alleged victim.

> …

> 149    The foregoing principles can be distilled into the following summary as our answer to the Specific Test Question:

>> (b)    The principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt entails that upon considering all the evidence presented by the parties, the evidence suffices to establish beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the charge against the accused person.

>> …

>> (k)    Whether an eyewitness’s uncorroborated evidence is unusually convincing (and therefore capable of discharging the Prosecution’s burden of proving the case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt) requires an assessment of the internal and external consistencies of the eyewitness’s account, and of any other evidence that the court is bound to consider, which includes the Defence’s case and the evidence adduced by the accused person (or the lack thereof). A finding must be made as to the relevant facts before the court directs itself to the ultimate inquiry of whether the Prosecution’s case has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

45     The following issues had to be determined:

> (a)     Was there an agreement between the Accused and Nurharyadi as at 13 June 2019?

> (b)     If so, was the agreement between the Accused and Nurharyadi to impair the usefulness of data stored in the HMI Data Logger onboard “Fragrance”, i.e. to cause the HMI Data Logger to erroneously record that more marine fuel was delivered to the “Southern Glory” than what was actually delivered?

> (c)     Was it pursuant to the said agreement with the Accused that Nurharyadi applied the magnet to the MFM on 13 June 2019?

46     Having considered the evidence, in particular, Nurharyadi’s testimony, and the testimony of Aziz, Helmi and Randy as to Nurharyadi’s admissions to them on 13 June 2019, I made the following findings of fact:

> (a)     The magnet was kept in a concealed location on the deck of “Fragrance”, on top of a wooden plank that was situated above Nurharyadi’s height.

> (b)     The magnet was wrapped completely in what appeared to be grey canvas tape, the colour of which was consistent with the grey surface of the MFM, which would have made the magnet less conspicuous to any observer while it was applied to the MFM. In addition, the position where Nurharyadi had applied the magnet was on the inner, back-facing side of the MFM which was not easily visible to persons who were walking in front of the MFM while accessing the metal staircase on the deck. In fact, Nurharyadi had identified the position on the MFM where he had applied the magnet by a chip or peel in the grey paintwork of the MFM, which suggested that that particular spot on the MFM had undergone some wear and tear, likely due to the repeated application and removal of the grey canvas tape used to apply the magnet to the MFM.

> (c)     Nurharyadi must have known that the application of the magnet to the MFM during the bunkering operation between “Fragrance” and “Southern Glory” was disallowed by the authorities, such that he had to dispose of the magnet if MPA or PCG officers came onboard “Fragrance”.

> (d)     Nurharyadi must have known that the application of the magnet to the MFM during bunkering operations had an effect on the running of the MFM, which effect could be observed from the HMI Data Logger in the CCR, although he did not describe exactly what the effect was.

> (e)     Coriolis’s assessment of the Coriolis flow meter data for 28 bills of lading flow profiles showed that there were four prior occasions where the magnet had been applied to the MFM.

> (f)     The application of the magnet to the MFM on 13 June 2019 would thus not have been unprecedented onboard “Fragrance” and would likely not have been unknown to Nurharyadi.

> (g)     As the bunker clerk on duty on 13 June 2019, the Accused was solely in-charge of the bunkering operation between “Fragrance” and “Southern Glory”. In that capacity, he had given instructions to the crew of “Fragrance”, including Nurharyadi, on the commencement of the bunkering operation, and monitored the supply of marine fuel from “Fragrance” to “Southern Glory” through the HMI Data Logger in the CCR.

47     In assessing Nurharyadi’s evidence, and his credibility as a witness, I considered the internal consistency and external consistency of his evidence, as well as its logic and reasonableness. I was mindful that Nurharyadi might not have been totally truthful and forthcoming in his evidence.

48     First, while he testified that 13 June 2019 was the first time that he had applied a magnet to the MFM, analysis of the Coriolis flow meter data for 28 bills of lading flow profiles showed that there were four prior occasions where the magnet had been applied to the MFM while he was working as the Assistant Bosun onboard “Fragrance”. It was, however, not clear from the evidence whether each of these four occasions had occurred during Nurharyadi’s shift, such that he was personally involved in each of the four bunkering operations.

49     Second, Nurharyadi was unable to explain why, if it was his first time using the magnet and no one had taught him how to use the magnet, he knew exactly where to find the concealed magnet above the wooden plank and where on the MFM to apply the magnet in order for the flow meter data to have been successfully manipulated. In this regard, Benjamin Swisher testified that it was important which side of the MFM the magnet was applied to, because if somebody took the magnet and applied it to the opposite side, there would be under-reporting of the flow rate, instead of the intended over-reporting.[^89] In other words, in order for someone to tamper with the voltage sensor in the MFM, that person would have needed specific knowledge of where to apply the magnet to the MFM.

50     Third, when asked how long he was supposed to apply the magnet to the MFM for, Nurharyadi replied, “1 hour”.[^90] However, according to Emerson’s assessment of the Coriolis flow meter data for the bunkering operation from “Fragrance” to “Southern Glory”, the magnet had been applied for 1.31 hours. Had Nurharyadi not spotted the MPA vessel approaching “Fragrance” and hurriedly removed the magnet from the MFM, the duration that the magnet was applied to the MFM would in all likelihood have been longer than 1.31 hours.

51     Even though Nurharyadi might have downplayed the extent of his involvement in manipulating the Coriolis flow meter data in terms of the number of occasions on which, and the duration for which, he had applied the magnet to the MFM (presumably to minimise his exposure to criminal liability), I was satisfied that his testimony that he had so on 13 June 2019, and that it was the Accused who had instructed him to do so, remained clear and unwavering. In this regard, I noted that Nurharyadi had earlier pleaded guilty to a parallel charge and was serving his imprisonment sentence when he testified in the present trial. Further, there was no clear evidence that Nurharyadi had any reason to falsely implicate the Accused in the conspiracy to apply the magnet to the MFM.

52     I had admitted evidence concerning the four previous occasions in which the magnet was applied to the MFM, and the Accused’s pier entry and exit records surrounding those occasions, pursuant to section 15 Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), as I was of the view that they formed part of a series of similar occurrences and were relevant to the present question of whether the application of the magnet to the MFM on 13 June 2019 was done with the Accused’s knowledge and pursuant to his conspiracy with Nurharyadi.

53     On the three prior occasions where the magnet was applied to the MFM allegedly on the Accused’s watch (see \[31\] above), the Accused claimed that he was not onboard “Fragrance” as he had spent a significant amount of time waiting at the pier to be ferried to “Fragrance”, or waiting on “Fragrance” to be ferried to the pier. The Accused was, however, unable to quantify the amount of time that he had spent waiting for the vessels to ferry him between the pier and “Fragrance”, or the amount of time that he had spent travelling between the pier and “Fragrance”. Neither did the Accused adduce any evidence to substantiate his claim that the availability of these vessels was infrequent, inconsistent and unpredictable, and that he had to sometimes spend hours waiting at the pier for a vessel to ferry him to “Fragrance” or waiting on “Fragrance” for a vessel to ferry him to the pier. Further, considering that the Accused’s work shift started at 12am on the days that he was on duty, his colleague from the earlier shift would be waiting to hand over the bunkering duties to him, he had to oversee the bunkering operations that were scheduled to take place during his shift (including the signing of bunkering related documents with the representative of the receiving vessel) and he had to instruct the crew to start or end the bunkering operation, it was unbelievable that the Accused had the latitude to wait helplessly at the pier for a vessel to come by to ferry him to “Fragrance”, or on “Fragrance” for a vessel to ferry him back to the pier at the end of his work shift. Be that as it may, there was no dispute that on 13 June 2019 the Accused was onboard “Fragrance” throughout the time that the magnet was applied to the MFM.

54     As the owner of “Fragrance” and the Accused’s employer, Tay had previously allowed all his bunker clerks (who would have included the Accused) to use magnets onboard the bunkering vessels to assist him in cutting losses by inflating the meter readings taken by the MFM system, which readings the Bunker Delivery Notes and other billing-related documents were based on. This enabled Tay’s companies to bill the receiving vessel for more marine fuel than what was actually supplied to them, and at the same time to have more marine fuel remaining onboard the bunkering vessel than what was reflected in the HMI Data Logger. As a result of the Southernpec case where the bunkering industry became aware that the use of magnets in bunkering operations was illegal, Tay claimed that he had instructed all his bunker clerks to stop using such magnets since their use was illegal. There was, however, no evidence that Tay had taken any affirmative steps to ensure that all magnets had been removed from the bunkering vessels (including “Fragrance”) that his bunker clerks were working on, and that none of his bunker clerks (including the Accused) had continued to use magnets during bunkering operations.

55     As one of the bunker clerks employed by Tay, the Accused would have been privy to Tay’s instructions endorsing the use of magnets during bunkering operations. Further, as the bunker clerk on duty onboard “Fragrance”, the Accused would have been the person-in-charge of the bunkering operations, and would have been accountable to Tay for the amount of marine fuel supplied to the receiving vessel and the amount of marine fuel remaining onboard “Fragrance” during the bunkering operations. He would also have access to the HMI Data Logger in the CCR from which he would have monitored, _inter alia_, the specifications of the marine fuel being supplied, the flow rate and the mass of marine fuel supplied. In addition, the Accused’s entry and exit records showed that he was likely to have been onboard “Fragrance” either throughout the operation, or part of the operation, for three out of the four previous bunkering operations in which magnets were applied to the MFM to manipulate the readings captured by the HMI Data Logger.

56     I noted that when Aziz boarded “Fragrance” and found the magnet, the Accused found it necessary to telephone his girlfriend to inform her that MPA officers had found a magnet onboard “Fragrance” and that he might be arrested. Further, when Helmi approached the Accused in his cabin, Helmi observed that the Accused was smoking cigarette after cigarette in his cabin, had shaky hands, and appeared “very nervous”.

57     In addition to the above, the Accused was unable to provide a logical and reasonable explanation for carrying onboard “Fragrance” cash of SGD 3,099 for his duty on 13 June 2019, considering that he had no way of spending such a large sum of money while he was out at sea. His explanation that the cash was part of some SGD 30,000 that his wife (as opposed to his girlfriend as he had earlier informed Helmi) had given to him from the sale of their flat, and that he had a habit of carrying on his person whatever cash he possessed (regardless of how large the amount was) instead of safekeeping it at home or in the bank was unbelievable, particularly since he was exposed to the risk of accidents, theft or misplacement while out at sea.

58     The Accused’s explanation concerning the sudden disappearance of his mobile phone when the MPA or PCG officers came onboard “Fragrance” was also baffling. The Accused had been working onboard vessels as a bunker clerk since 2016. Over the years, he would have been familiar with, or developed, protocols to ensure his personal safety and the safety of his personal belongings while working onboard vessels such as “Fragrance”. Considering that his mobile phone was the primary tool of his trade and his primary means of communication with his office to receive instructions and provide updates on bunkering operations that “Fragrance” had to undertake during his shift, one would imagine that he would have taken all necessary steps to secure his mobile phone to prevent it from being misplaced or damaged while at sea. Moreover, prior to Aziz’s arrival onboard “Fragrance”, the Accused had been using his mobile phone regularly to communicate with his girlfriend via text messages and phone calls. I found it too coincidental that it was only upon Aziz’s arrival on “Fragrance” that the Accused’s mobile phone allegedly accidentally fell into the sea and could not be recovered.

59     I would like to observe at this point that the Prosecution could have done better to present the evidence in a more systematic and comprehensive manner, in terms of the sequence of events from the time Aziz boarded “Fragrance” at about 4.00pm to the time Randy, Helmi and the team of PCG and CID forensic officers left “Fragrance” with the Accused and Nurharyadi at about 10.20pm.

60     Due to how the Prosecution had led the evidence from their witnesses, there was confusion as to how many re-enactments were done, when they were done and who were involved in each enactment, when and how many times the “Southern Glory” crew had boarded “Fragrance”, which of the “Southern Glory” crew had boarded “Fragrance” on each occasion, when the gangway of “Southern Glory” was lowered and pulled towards “Fragrance” to facilitate their descend, as well as if and how the Accused was involved in pulling the gangway towards “Fragrance”, during which time his mobile phone allegedly fell into the sea.

61     There were also inconsistencies in the timings reported by Aziz, Helmi and Randy as to when Helmi, Randy and Zamakhsyarii had arrived on “Fragrance” in the afternoon of 13 June 2019. Aziz testified that “PCG officers” arrived at “Fragrance” at 4.45pm without specifying whether these PCG officers were patrol officers or Investigation Officers. The Prosecution submitted that Aziz was referring to the PCG patrol officers and not the PCG Investigation Officers. However, Randy testified that he and his team of Investigation Officers (namely Helmi and Zamakhsyarii) arrived at “Fragrance” also at 4.45pm, despite their arrival being later in the sequence of events. Curiously, Helmi testified that it was only at about 5pm plus that “PCG” received a call about a magnet being found onboard “Fragrance”, following which Investigation Officers Helmi, Randy and Zamakhsyarii set out for “Fragrance”. It was clear that the first information report was lodged at 4.39pm. The timings mentioned by the various witnesses made sense only if it was the PCG operations room that received the call at 4.39pm and despatched the two PCG patrol officers to “Fragrance” as first responders, arriving at “Fragrance” at 4.45pm, and it was the PCG investigation team that received the call at 5pm plus for their Investigation Officers to proceed to “Fragrance” to conduct investigations, which then meant that Randy had recalled the 4.45pm arrival timing incorrectly. The mystery was solved only when Firdaus was called to testify at the closing submissions stage, when he testified that the PCG operations room had received the first information report at 4.39pm and had despatched Mohana and him to “Fragrance” as first responders and that he and Mohana had arrived at 4.45pm. Considering that the PCG patrol officers and Investigation Officers were police officers who were expected to maintain operation log sheets, field diaries and/ or pocket books to account for their deployments and movements, there should have been greater clarity in their testimonies in respect of the timings and sequence of events.

62     There was also inconsistency in what had taken place onboard “Fragrance” between Aziz and Nurharyadi before Firdaus and Mohana’s arrival at 4.45pm, including the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the magnet from the plastic container in the wooden crate and how the magnet had become stuck onto the frame of the metal staircase. While Aziz testified that he had waited until the arrival of the PCG patrol officers (i.e. Firdaus and Mohana) before bringing them to the wooden crate to recover the magnet, and that he had attempted to demonstrate to the PCG officers how strong the magnet was, during which process the magnet became stuck onto the frame of the metal staircase,[^91] Firdaus testified that by the time he and Mohana arrived on “Fragrance”, the magnet was no longer in the plastic container in the wooden crate and was already stuck onto the frame of the metal staircase. If a re-enactment had indeed been conducted before Firdaus and Mohana’s arrival at 4.45pm, the Prosecution remained unable to account for when the magnet was recovered from the plastic container in the wooden crate, who had recovered the magnet, who from “Fragrance” and/or “Southern Glory” had witnessed the re-enactment and how the magnet had become stuck onto the metal staircase.

63     In assessing the evidence in its totality, I distinguished between what I considered to be (i) deliberate untruths, (ii) inadvertent inaccuracies in recollection due to the officers’ failure to keep detailed and contemporaneous documentation of their involvement in the operation and the imperfections of human memory over time, and (iii) peculiarities of trial strategy, insufficient pre-trial preparation of the witnesses or imprecision in examining the witnesses during trial. In my judgement, the observations that I had highlighted above were of the latter two categories, and while they had resulted in unnecessary confusion and complication during the trial and closing submissions, I was satisfied that they did not undermine the veracity of these witnesses’ testimonies where the material evidence surrounding the main point of contention (i.e. the conspiracy between the Accused and Nurharyadi) was concerned.

64     I was also mindful that the abovementioned inaccuracies related to events that took place only after the commission of the offence (i.e. the placing of the magnet onto the MFM by Nurharyadi and the removal of the magnet from the MFM by Nurharyadi pursuant to the conspiracy between the Accused and him). Further, there was no credible evidence during the trial that the Prosecution witnesses had intended or attempted to falsely implicate the Accused in the commission of the offence.

65     In my judgment, the inference to be drawn from the abovementioned analysis was that the Accused must have known about the illegal use of the magnet onboard “Fragrance” during its bunkering operation with “Southern Glory” on 13 June 2019. Further, he must have instructed its use, with the connivance and assistance of Nurharyadi to apply the magnet to the MFM and to dispose of it should MPA or PCG officers come onboard. As the bunker clerk on duty, the Accused must therefore have known, and must have intended, for the application of the magnet to manipulate the operation of the MFM system and to inflate the volume of marine fuel recorded by the HMI Data Logger as having been supplied to “Southern Glory”. In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Accused had on 13 June 2019 engaged in a conspiracy with Nurharyadi to impair the usefulness of data stored in the HMI Data Logger onboard “Fragrance” and that it was pursuant to the conspiracy that Nurharyadi had on 13 June 2019 applied the magnet to the MFM.

## Decision on Conviction

66     Having assessed the evidence in its totality, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on the charge against him.

## Criminal Antecedents

67     The Accused was untraced with any criminal antecedents.

## Prescribed Punishment

68     The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 7(1)(b) r/w section 10(1) CMA is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

69     The Prosecution tendered comprehensive written submissions for the Accused to be sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment on grounds which can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     The use of magnets to tamper with MFM readings facilitates cheating in bunkering transactions and severely compromises the integrity of Singapore’s bunkering industry, which is crucial to maintaining Singapore’s standing as an international shipping hub. This will result in reputational damage and harm to Singapore’s national interest.

> (b)     The dominant sentencing consideration is general deterrence.

> (c)     The Accused was more culpable than Nurharyadi in the commission of the offence and should be sentenced to higher than the five months’ imprisonment that Nurharyadi received.

> (d)     There were no offender-specific mitigating factors operating in the Accused’s favour.

70     As no cases of a similar nature had gone on appeal to the High Court, the Prosecution highlighted the following District Court cases to guide the Court:

> (a)      **_PP v Nurharyadi_** (SC-905175-2019) heard on 27 August 2019;

> (b)      **_PP v Chua Yew Hui, Andy_** (SC-903639-2019) heard on 9 June 2020;

> (c)      **_PP v Ang Heng Chye_** (SC-904318-2019) heard on 26 August 2020; and

> (d)      **_PP v Yazid Hafizuddin bin Abdul Khair_** (SC-908949-2018) heard on 23 November 2018.

## Defence’s Mitigation Plea

71     Defence Counsel tendered a written mitigation plea, which urged the Court to sentence the Accused to not more than five months’ imprisonment, which was the same sentence that Nurharyadi had received.

72     In oral submissions, Defence Counsel re-calibrated the appropriate sentence to about seven months’ imprisonment. In his mitigation plea, Defence Counsel had also relied on the cases of **_PP v Nurharyadi_** and **_PP v Chua Yew Hui, Andy_**.

## Decision on Sentence

73     I sentenced the Accused to 10 months’ imprisonment.

76     The Prosecution and Defence agreed that while Nurharyadi fell within the Low Culpability – Severe Harm range in the abovementioned table, the Accused fell within the Medium Culpability (lower end) - Severe Harm range. The Defence submitted that the Accused could also have been brought within the Low Culpability (upper end) – Severe Harm range.

## Offence-specific factors

77     I agreed with the Prosecution that there were the following offence-specific aggravating factors in the Accused’s case:

> Culpability

> (a)     The Accused had abused his position as the bunker clerk on duty, and the trust that his company had reposed in him to oversee the bunkering operation and to ensure its integrity.

> (b)     The Accused, by standing in a more senior position vis-à-vis Nurharyadi and by instructing Nurharyadi on installing, removing and disposing the magnet, had played a role that was higher in the value chain than Nurharyadi.

> (c)     The commission of the offence was premeditated and the Accused, by using Nurharyadi to install, remove and dispose the magnet, had deliberately distanced himself from the offending acts in the hope of not implicating himself in the event of a raid. Unsurprisingly, he had at trial pushed all the blame onto Nurharyadi who earlier pleaded guilty to the offence.

> (d)     The offence was committed through sophisticated means. The simple act of attaching the magnet to the MFM using the grey canvas tape belied the specific technical knowledge necessary to know exactly where on the MFM to place the magnet in order to achieve the intended effect, and to know how to monitor and interpret the readings in the HMI Data Logger in the CCR.

> Harm

> (e)     The tampering of MFM data causes financial loss to the receiving vessel that the bunkering vessel is supplying the marine fuel to. Considering that each metric tonne of marine fuel can cost up to USD 378 (as in the present case), and that the shortfall resulting from the tampering of the MFM data can be up to 30 metric tonnes per bunkering transaction (see DAC-901799-2020 in **_PP v Ang Heng Chye_**), the financial loss to the receiving vessel can be rather substantial.

> (f)     Since the use of such magnets onboard bunkering vessels is committed while at sea, and since it is relatively convenient for such magnets to be disposed into the sea upon detection, it is difficult for MPA officers to successfully catch the perpetrators red-handed. According to the Prosecution, significant labour, expertise, time and cost are needed to analyse the MFM data for past transactions in order to identify suspicious transactions where the data may have been manipulated by an external source, such as the application of magnets. Even if such suspicious transactions are highlighted by Coriolis, much time and effort will need to be expended by the Police in their investigations in order to trace the relevant persons who were not only onboard the vessel but were participating in the bunkering operation while the MFM data was being manipulated.

> (g)     Commercial entities looking to transact in Singapore would lose confidence in the MFM system if there is widespread tampering of MFM data through the use of such magnets and if such incidents of tampering are not swiftly, effectively and resolutely detected, investigated and punished. The tampering of the MFM onboard a bunkering vessel, which was specifically designed by MPA and which installation and use on all bunkering vessels operating within Singapore were mandated by MPA to ensure the integrity of bunkering operations within Singapore waters, undermined Singapore’s standing as the leading and largest bunkering hub in the world.

## Sentencing precedents

78     Nurharyadi, whom parties agreed was less culpable than the Accused, was placed in the Low Culpability - Severe Harm range of the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework, which prescribed five to 10 months’ imprisonment. In view of the Accused’s higher culpability, I agreed with the Prosecution and Defence that the Accused should be placed in the Medium Culpability - Severe Harm range of the Prosecution’s proposed framework, which attracts a significantly higher sentence of between 10 and 20 months’ imprisonment.

79     In **_PP v Chua Yew Hui, Andy_**, the accused faced seven charges under section 7(1)(a) r/w section 10(1) Computer Misuse Act. He pleaded guilty to three charges and consented for four charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The shortfall in the marine fuel that was supplied to the receiving vessel ranged from 12.5 metric tonnes to 28 metric tonnes. The accused placed the magnet on the MFM and also facilitated the bunkering operations by using pre-signed Bunker Delivery Notes to record the details of each delivery, such as the quantity of marine fuel delivered and the date, time and place of the delivery. The accused also recorded the quantity of marine fuel saved through the use of the magnet by comparing the MFM readings and the readings that were taken by manual sounding. The accused received at least SGD 50 for each completed Bunker Delivery Note, and an additional SGD 30 for every metric tonne of marine fuel saved through the use of the magnet. The offences were committed between January 2019 and 19 April 2019. The accused was not employed as a bunker clerk onboard the bunkering vessel, was untraced with criminal antecedents and had pleaded guilty. The Prosecution had classified the case in the Low Culpability – Severe Harm category. For the charge involving shortfall of 14.5 metric tonnes of marine fuel, the accused received four months’ imprisonment (DAC-912802-2019). For the charge involving shortfall of 18 metric tonnes of marine fuel, the accused received four months and two weeks’ imprisonment (DAC-913879-2019). For the charge involving shortfall of 28 metric tonnes of marine fuel, the accused received five months’ imprisonment (DAC-913881-2019). The total sentence was nine months’ imprisonment.

80     In **_PP v Ang Heng Chye_**, the accused faced 24 charges under section 7(1)(b) r/w section 10(1) Computer Misuse Act and one charge under section 204A Penal Code. He pleaded guilty to five CMA charges and the section 204A Penal Code charge. The remaining charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The shortfall in marine fuel in the five CMA charges ranged from 21.2 to 30 metric tonnes. The accused was employed as a cargo officer onboard a bunkering vessel. His job was to perform and manage bunkering operations, to record the amount of fuel transferred on the Bunker Delivery Note and to keep records of the fuel remaining onboard. He also placed the magnet on the MFM during the bunkering operations. The offences were committed between December 2018 and April 2019, during which the accused was paid a commission of at least SGD 4,000 per month, in addition to his monthly salary of SGD 2,500. In respect of the CMA charges, it is noteworthy that the Court had classified this case in the Medium Culpability – Severe Harm category and agreed that the indicative starting point for each CMA charge was 12 months’ imprisonment. The Court had then given the accused a substantial discount on account of his plea of guilty and sentenced the accused to six to eight months’ imprisonment per charge. He received five months’ imprisonment for the Penal Code charge. His total sentence was 19 months’ imprisonment. The accused was untraced, apart from a 2001 conviction for corruption for which he was fined SGD 6,000.

## Offender-specific factors

81     Unlike Nurharyadi, who confessed to his role in the commission of the offence from the outset, was remorseful, cooperated with the authorities and pleaded guilty early, there were no offender-specific mitigating factors in the Accused’s favour. He was not remorseful. He did not confess to his wrongdoing. He did not cooperate with the police in their investigations and he did not plead guilty to the offence.

82     Considering the offence-specific factors in the present case, I found that the indicative starting point had to be significantly higher than the five months’ imprisonment that Nurharyadi had received, particularly since parties agreed that this case fell within the Moderate Culpability – Severe Harm category of the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that while the shortfall in the quantity of marine fuel was one of the primary factors to be considered in determining the appropriate sentence to impose on the Accused, it was not the only factor to be considered. While the shortfall in the present case was only 4.24 metric tonnes, I noted that it was the result of the premature removal of the magnet from the MFM when Nurharyadi observed Aziz approaching “Fragrance” in the MPA vessel. Significant weight would also have to be given to the role that the Accused had played in the commission of the offence, the public policy considerations and the general deterrence objective. In the circumstances, I found that the appropriate indicative starting point was 10 months’ imprisonment.

83     As there were no offender-specific mitigating factors that operated in the Accused’s favour, there was no basis to award the Accused any discount from the indicative starting point. In the circumstances, I sentenced the Accused to 10 months’ imprisonment, which was at the lowest end of the sentencing range of 10 to 20 months’ imprisonment for the Moderate Culpability – Severe Harm category of the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework.

## Conclusion

84     The Accused was dissatisfied with my decision and appealed against his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail of SGD 20,000.
