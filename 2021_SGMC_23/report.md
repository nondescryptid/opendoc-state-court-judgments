Criminal Law – Statutory offences – Voluntary Causing Hurt – Grave and Sudden Provocation

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9076/2021/01.\]

22 April 2021

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mr Oon Joo Seng, a 52-year-old male Singaporean, was charged with voluntarily causing hurt to one Haziq Firdaus Bin Sharuldin (“the victim”), an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed. The charge reads:.

> You…are charged that you, on 26th day of March 2018 at about 5pm, at New Upper Changi Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Haziq Firdaus Bin Sharuldin, _to wit_, by punching four to five times on the said Haziq Firdaus Bin Sharuldin’s helmet and once on his mouth causing him to suffer a cut on his lips, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2       The accused claimed trial to the charge. At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to prove the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted him accordingly. Thereafter, following sentencing submissions from the Prosecution, and a written mitigation plea, I imposed a sentence of four (4) weeks’ imprisonment. I also ordered the accused to pay compensation of $120 to the victim.

3       The accused has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He has, however, paid the compensation sum. I now give the detailed reasons for my decision on conviction and sentence.

## The Prosecution’s Case

4       The Prosecution called a total of five witnesses. They were a forensic specialist who prepared a sketch plan of the scene, the victim, two police officers, and a doctor who prepared a medical report based on the medical notes of another doctor who had attended to the victim. The Prosecution also presented an opening statement (PS1), which essentially summarised its case. I set out the main aspects of this below.

### Outline of Prosecution’s case based on the opening statement

5       On 26 March 2018, sometime before 5.00pm, the victim was riding a motorcycle bearing registration number FBA 6358A (“the Motorcycle”) on the first lane (from the right) of New Upper Changi Road, towards Changi Road. The accused was driving a lorry bearing registration number XD 3599P (“the Lorry”) on the second lane (from the right) of the same road. While the victim was travelling along New Upper Changi Road, the Lorry suddenly swerved into his lane and cut into his path of travel. The victim swerved to the right and narrowly avoided a collision. Following this, the victim sounded his horn, revved his engine, pointed his middle finger and exchanged vulgarities with the accused, as he was angry that the Lorry had almost collided into him.

6       The victim subsequently proceeded straight on the same lane and stopped at the junction of Bedok South Road and New Upper Changi Road, as the traffic light had turned red. The accused travelled to the extreme left lane and parked the Lorry at a slip road at the said junction. The accused then approached the victim and they were embroiled in a verbal dispute, during which the accused suddenly punched the victim’s helmet and mouth, with the intention of causing hurt to the victim. The victim did not retaliate and the assault ceased only after an unidentified passer-by intervened. The victim then went to the void deck of Block 422 Bedok North Road and called the Police.

7       Following this, Sergeant Chua Chang Yu (“Sgt Chua”) was despatched to Block 422 Bedok North Road on 26 March 2018 and arrived there at about 5.24pm, where he attended to the victim, and took photographs of the victim’s injury and helmet.

8       The victim was subsequently examined by Dr Looi Chong Heng (“Dr Looi”) at Changi General Hospital on 27 March 2019 at 12.16am. Dr Looi produced a medical report dated 3 October 2019 that showed as a result of the assault, the victim suffered pain on his head, face and right lower lip, and a cut and a contusion to his right lower lip. The contusion was consistent with the victim’s account of the assault.

9       Two statements were recorded by the Investigation Officer, Assistant Superintendent Lee Jun Hong, Melvin (“ASP Melvin”) from the accused on 28 March 2018 and 14 March 2019 respectively. The Prosecution stated that they showed the accused to have confessed to assaulting the victim.

10     I will now set out aspects of the main witnesses’ testimonies.

### The victim’s evidence about the assault and aftermath

11     The victim is a food pander rider. He confirmed that he had lodged the First Information Report (FIR – P4) on 26th March 2018 wherein he had stated that “Lorry guy punch me. My lips got cut. I don’t know him at all. He left already. The plate number is XD3599P. I don’t want ambulance.” The incident happened at New Upper Changi Road towards Changi Road.

12     The victim testified that on that date, he was heading towards home at Blk 422 Bedok North Road, and was riding his motorbike along New Upper Changi Road, which was a three lane road. He was travelling on the far right lane riding at a speed of less than 50 kmh when a lorry driver, driving a 24-foot lorry (“The Lorry”) in the centre lane, swerved into his lane. The Lorry was around one car length from him at that time, and the lorry driver did not signal before changing lane. The victim testified that this incident occurred along New Upper Changi Road near the bus stop.

13     As a result of the lorry driver’s action, the victim immediately swerved to the right to avoid the Lorry. The victim said that he was scared and angry when this happened. He scolded vulgarities once, and pointed his middle finger at the lorry driver. In addition, he horned and revved his bike engine at the lorry driver. The accused, who was the lorry driver, then wound down his window and said something which the victim could no longer remember.

14     The victim said that he continued riding straight ahead but had to stop his motorcycle at the junction of New Upper Changi Road as the traffic light had turned red. The accused also moved the Lorry to the left and stopped at the filter lane right before the zebra crossing, and this was to the left of the victim. The accused then alighted from the Lorry and walked towards the victim who was sitting on his bike. The accused, who looked angry and was standing about one metre away from the victim, then asked the latter why he had scolded him. The victim responded with vulgarities like “fuck” and “chibai”, and said that the accused had almost hit into him. The accused responded angrily that he had not done so. The victim also asked the accused why he had not given way to him. The conversation between them was carried out in English.

15     The victim said that subsequently, the accused moved closer to him rather than turn away. The accused then used his right hand to punch the victim. This punch landed on the left side cap of the victim’s helmet causing the side cap to fall off. The accused then threw fast punches four to five times in the form of left and right hooks, on the left and right side of the victim’s helmet. One of the punches, made with the accused’s left hand, landed on the right bottom lip of the victim.

16     The victim said that he felt pain on his head, face and lip as a result of the assault by the accused, and the punches also caused him to feel dizzy. He closed his eyes when he was getting punched,[^1] and felt scared and angry at that time. The victim did not retaliate as the accused was bigger than he was. Instead, the victim swung “..his arms to get away from it”,[^2] but did not know if his arms came into contact with the accused. However, he did not think that swinging his arms in this manner helped in any way as “nothing stopped”.[^3] He also tried to get up from his bike away from the punches.

17     The victim said that the assault by the accused ended only when a third party pulled the victim away. The third party also told the victim to calm down and to take a photo of the Lorry. The victim then saw the accused get back to the Lorry and drive off, despite the victim telling him to stop.

18     The victim denied defence counsel’s suggestion that he came down from his motorcycle and was fighting with the accused who held his two hands.[^4] The victim also denied that the incident stopped when the accused released the victim’s hand and walked away, and not because of any third party intervention. In addition, he also said that his motorcycle helmet visor was pushed up before he was punched, but that afterwards, the side cap flew off. In his words, “…basically, the visor just went up and down, uh, throughout the punches.”[^5]

19     Before the accused drove off, the victim took a photograph of the Lorry. The victim then rode home and contacted the police for assistance. He also told his parents that he had been punched. Following the assault, the victim said that there was blood on his bottom right leg from a cut, and also blood on his hip and face. In addition, the victim said that he felt dizzy and pain on his face.[^6]

20     The victim went to the Changi General Hospital (CGH) where he told the doctor about the incident, about where he got punched, and also where he felt the pain. The victim said that the doctor didn’t speak much with him. The victim was then given some medicine and had to pay more than $100 for medical fees. He was given two days of medical leave. The victim said that he went to the hospital after 9 pm, and stayed there till after midnight.

21     The victim also said that the photograph P5, taken by the police officers, showed blood on his bottom right lip. Photograph P6 showed the position on his helmet where the side cap was supposed to be, but the side cap had actually fallen off, and the helmet could not be used anymore. As for photograph P7, this showed that there was blood on the visor. The victim said that he has since disposed of his helmet and replaced it with a new one for $80. The victim also said that prior to the incident on 26th March 2018, he did not know the accused.

### Evidence of the police officer who attended at the scene

22     PW3 Sergeant Chua Chang Yu (“Sgt Chua”), was the police officer dispatched to deal with the report made by the victim. On the date of the incident, he had proceeded to the scene at Block 422 Bedok North Road and had met the victim at the void deck. Sgt Chua saw a blood stain on the right side of the victim’s mouth area which he said was like a “…cut on the lips on the right side”.[^7] The victim said that he did not need an ambulance. Sgt Chua then took photographs of the victim’s injuries as well as the damage on his helmet. One of the photograph P5 showed redness on the victim’s lower lip and a blood stain, while another photograph P6 showed something like a crack on the visor. The victim had also informed him that a cap on the visor had come off. As for photograph P7, this showed blood stains on the visor of the helmet, as well as on the top of the helmet. According to Sgt Chua, the victim had described the incident to him as follows:[^8]

> Okay. So, he told me that at about 1650 hours he was riding along New Upper Changi Road, uh, opposite Bedok Mall, lah, at the most right lane. So, there’s, uh, this, uh, lorry driver with the plate number XD53599P. So, he was like overtaking the vehicle in front. So, he swerved to my Complainant lane. So, almost hitting him, but, uh, Complainant managed to swerve to the right to avoid the collision. So, after that Complainant told me that, uh, he was angry at the point of time, lah, he rev the engines then he horn the driver. Af---after he horn he proceed to go straight. So, the dri---the lorry driver move beside, dr---drive beside him, lah. So, at that point of time, uh, this, uh, lorry driver look at him then he look back and he---Complainant scolded vulgarities at the lorry drivers. So, subsequently lorry driver also lower the window and scolded vulgarities once then after that the traffic light was red at that point of time, so the lorry driver turn left to the said road and stop there and approach this---uh, my Complainant. So, Complainant told me that, uh, the lorry driver asked him why did he scold vulgarities at him. So, he---Complainant told him that because, uh, the driver almost hit him, however the lorry driver insist that he never hit, lah. So, there was, uh, argument took place. **_So, Complainant told me that, suddenly this lorry driver use his left hand and punch once on his, uh, left face then subsequently there is a few more punches left and right, then one on the mouth area_**. So, after that Complainant told me that one driver came over to stop them and he ask him to take photo of the plate number and when he was taking the photo, uh, lorry diver already ran off. So, he went back to his void deck and he called for police assistance.

\[emphasis added\]

23     The victim also showed Sgt Chua the cut that he suffered on his lip. At that time, the victim was holding onto his helmet which had some scratches and cracks on the visor. The victim also informed Sgt Chua that he had swung his hands to get away from the lorry driver. After interviewing the victim, Sgt Chua briefed the investigation officer, ASP Melvin Lee (IO Melvin). He also handed the victim a medical form, and advised him to go to the hospital for a check-up.

### Evidence of the investigation officer (IO Melvin)

24     IO Melvin is an assistant superintendent of police. On 26th March 2018, he was the duty investigation officer (IO). He was briefed by the frontline officers who had attended to the case. He gave instructions for the taking of the photographs, as well as for the recording of the victim’s statement.

25     Based on information provided by the victim of the lorry’s registration number (XD3599P), IO Melvin managed to find out that the accused was the owner of the vehicle. IO Melvin then contacted the accused and subsequently recorded a statement from the accused on 28th March 2018 at about 3:30pm at Bedok Division level 3 interview room..

26     The statement P9 was recorded from the accused in Mandarin which was the language that he was more comfortable speaking in. IO Melvin confirmed that he himself was also conversant in Mandarin as he had taken Mandarin subjects in school until he was in junior college. IO Melvin said that he first identified himself, and then took down the accused’s particulars. He also informed the accused that he was going to record the statement and that the accused ought to give the statement truthfully.

27     For the seven paragraphs in P9, IO Melvin said that they were recorded in a narrative format. At the conclusion of the statement recording, he had read through the whole statement with the accused in Mandarin to see if there was any amendment to be made. IO Melvin also showed the statement to the accused, and went through the statement line by line, paragraph by paragraph.[^9] IO Melvin then invited the accused to point out if there was anywhere in P9 that he wanted to change.

28     IO Melvin also said that the amendment at paragraph 2 of P9 was made by him because it was a typographical error that he had spotted when reading through the statement after it was printed out. He had signed next to the amendment. Also at paragraph 6, 3rd line from the bottom, the word “provocation” was cancelled and the word “provocative” was added instead, as this was a grammatical error. Similarly, IO Melvin had made this amendment and signed beside it, after he had spotted the error when reading the printed statement. IO Melvin confirmed that the accused was aware of the amendments, and that they were made in front of the accused in the interview room.

29     Aside from the amendments at paragraphs 2 and 6, the accused did not propose any amendments to P9, even though IO Melvin invited him to do so, upon reading back the statement. In addition, as indicated at the end of the statement, there was no threat, inducement or promise made to the accused, and the accused affirmed that the statement was true and correct, and signed to confirm this. IO Melvin said that the signatures on the statement were appended after reading back of the statement, when he had invited the accused to sign at the top and bottom of each page, and at the middle of the 2nd page of the statement. IO Melvin also signed after the accused had signed, and wrote that the statement recording concluded at 4:30pm. IO Melvin said that the accused did not have any difficulty understanding him throughout the statement recording process.

30     In court, IO Melvin clarified that the word “started” at the 3rd line from the bottom of paragraph 4 should read “startled” instead i.e. the line should read “When I saw blood on his mouth, it had (startled) me a little and I immediately stopped”. Finally, from the date of recording of the statement (28 March 2018) to the date of his testimony (17 September 2020), IO Melvin has not received any information or complaint from the accused about the statement recording.

31     IO Melvin also recorded a cautioned statement P10 from the accused on 14th of March 2019 at about 5:45pm at Bedok Division. This was recorded in Mandarin at the accused’s preference. Similarly, the accused had no difficulty in understanding IO Melvin. For the recording of this statement, the accused had given a piece of paper containing what he wanted to say to IO Melvin, and requested IO Marvin to transfer its contents to the cautioned statement. Thereafter, as per the victim’s request, IO Melvin had copied the contents of the piece of paper onto the cautioned statement and showed this to the accused. The latter then confirmed that the contents of the paper had been transferred. IO Melvin also read the statement out to the accused in English, and invited the accused to sign at the bottom of the page which he did, followed by IO Melvin signing. IO Melvin did not keep a copy of the paper given to him by the accused.

### Medical Examination of the victim

32     The accused was examined by Dr Farid Khan at CGH on 26 March 2018. Based on Dr Khan’s consultation notes, Dr Looi of CGH had prepared a medical report P8 in which he had stated that the victim was diagnosed with “a contusion lip”. Dr Looi’s report further indicated that Dr Khan had noted that “Mild bruise was seen over the right lower lip.”

33     When shown photograph P5 taken of the victim after the incident had occurred but before he had sought medical attention at CGH, Dr Looi noted a superficial cut on the victim as shown in the photograph. He said that in the case of a superficial cut, a patient’s bleeding might stop in about an hour. Thus, Dr Looi said that if the incident, that had caused the cut, happened at about 5:00pm, the cut might have closed and the bleeding stopped by 12:16am the following day when Dr Khan examined the victim. As for the reason why the victim did not have injuries on his face, Dr Looi opined that, based on Dr Khan’s consultation notes about the victim being hit on the face a few times with a fist, Dr Looi commented that the lack of injuries could have been because the victim was wearing a helmet and this may have shielded the impact.[^10]In any event, Dr Looi opined that the cut on the victim’s right lower lip after the incident, was consistent with the victim’s account of the assault.

34     As for his opinion why, if a patient had a suffered a cut at 5:00pm but a medical doctor did not notice such a cut at 12:16am the following day, Dr Looi explained that this could have been because the cut may have closed up, and the blood may have dried by then. Thus, it may just have appeared like a swelling which the doctor did not open up to probe and see more thoroughly.

## The Defence’s Case: Accused’s version of events

35     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, as there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible and which satisfied each and every element of the charge, I called on the accused to give his defence. The accused elected to testify and he was the only witness for the Defence.

36     The accused said that on 26 March 2018 at about 5.00 p.m., he was driving his lorry on Lane 3 along New Upper Changi Road heading towards his company. As he wanted to overtake a bus, the accused turned on the Lorry’s right signal light, and upon seeing that there was no vehicle, he slowly moved the Lorry out towards lane 3. However, when he saw the victim’s motorcycle travelling at a high speed on lane 3, he turned on the Lorry’s left signal and moved back towards lane 2. The accused said that when the victim rode pass the Lorry on his motorcycle, the victim showed the accused his middle finger.

37     The accused said that as he wanted to go to Bedok South Road, he then filtered into the extreme left lane and turned into the slip road. When he saw that the victim had stopped his motorcycle at the red light in lane 4 nearby, the accused stopped his lorry, alighted from it, and approached the victim.

38     The accused said that he then asked the victim in English, “Why did you point your middle finger at me?”, to which the victim replied that the accused had almost collided into him. The accused was angry that the victim insisted that he was in the wrong, even though he had already given way to the victim.

39     The accused testified that as he did not want to argue with the victim, he decided to turn around and leave. He said that when he did so, the victim scolded vulgarities “Na bei. Ka ni na bei chao chee bye” (translated as “fuck your mother’s smelly cunt”). The accused said that when he heard this, he had a “natural reaction”,[^11] whereby he turned round and used both his hands to hit the victim’s helmet four or five times with the bottom of his clenched fists. When asked if he had hit the victim on the face, the accused said that it “(s)hould be no”, before insisting that he had not hit the victim on the face.[^12] The accused agreed that he was angry with the victim and wanted to teach him a lesson for scolding his mother. Hence, he decided to punch the victim with his bare fists.[^13]

40     The accused said that the victim retaliated by throwing a punch at the accused, but the accused dodged this. He further claimed that the victim tried to throw another punch, following which the accused held on to both of the victim’s hands. The accused said that because the victim missed hitting him, he had stated in his long statement P9 that the motorcyclist “did not hit me at all”, even though he claimed that the victim had tried to hit him.[^14]

41     The accused also said that an Indian man then intervened and separated the victim and him. The accused said that he saw some blood on the lower part of the victim’s face and he decided to walk away. He said that the victim’s bleeding might have been caused by the visor of the victim’s helmet, or maybe the victim had bitten himself on the lips. The accused insisted that he did not hit the victim on his face.[^15] He also said that when he hit the victim on his helmet four or five times, he did not use hard force. Further, the accused claimed that if he had hit the victim on his face, the latter would not have suffered such “minor injuries”. In addition, the accused said that when he walking away from the scene, he heard the victim scolding vulgarities behind him.

42     When cross-examined, the accused agreed that the side cap of the victim’s helmet had come off because he had hit the victim,[^16] and that the bleeding on the victim’s mouth was caused by the victim being hit by him.[^17]

43     As for the contents of his cautioned statement P10, the accused said that when he stated that he was appealing for a “lighter penalty”, this was said before he had engaged a counsel. He further claimed to have asked for a lighter sentence because he had once gone to jail, and the IO had indicated that if he accepted the judgment, he would go to jail.[^18]In addition, he explained that he had stated in P10 that “I plead guilty and I am sorry that I resorted to those actions”, because he thought that hitting people and fighting was wrong.[^19]

## Summary of Defence’s Submissions

44     The Defence’s arguments were presented in its \`Submissions for the Accused (Oon Joo Seng)’. The arguments can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     This was not a road rage case, but one where the victim was largely to blame, and that it was the victim who was the aggressor in the affair. Counsel highlighted that the manner the victim rode his motorcycle, his sounding of the horn loudly, and his showing of the middle finger at the accused, were totally unnecessary as there was no danger of the accused’s lorry hitting the victim. That the victim had to swerve when the accused’s lorry was already half-way in lane 3, instead of the victim moving to the empty lane 4 on his right, also suggested that the victim must have been speeding at that time.

> (b)     After the accused stopped his lorry, he had approached the victim to ask the latter why he had shown the accused the middle finger, and the victim’s response was that the accused’s lorry had almost hit him. The accused had then turned to leave. However, when the victim shouted extremely rude vulgarities at the accused, including scolding the accused and his mother, this had provoked the accused. This led the accused to turn back to face the victim and hit the victim on the left side of his helmet. The accused landed a total of two punches on the left side on the top of the victim’s helmet, and two on the right side on the top of the victim’s helmet, but the punches were not very hard.

> (c)     Counsel argued that there were contradictions in the victim’s account. He submitted that Sgt Chua’s evidence was that the victim had complained that he was assaulted four to five times on his helmet and once on his lip, but that the account given by the victim to the doctor who examined him, was that he had been fisted on the face quite hard several times and punched on his right lower lip which had bled. The latter account was the first time that the victim had said that he had been fisted on the face, as opposed to being hit on the helmet, and also the first time that he had mentioned that the punch was on his right lower lip. Counsel further argued that the victim’s claim that he did not retaliate was a lie, as was the victim’s claim about being almost hit by the accused’s lorry.

> (d)     Counsel insisted that the accused did not punch the victim on the face at all as there were no injuries on the latter’s face, and argued that if the accused had punched the victim's lip, several teeth of the victim’s would have been broken, which was not what was found during the doctor's examination. Finally, the bleeding on the victim’s right lower lip was not caused by the accused, but could have been caused by his hitting his helmet or by the visor hitting and causing bleeding to the lip. This would explain why the victim disposed of the helmet which was a crucial piece of evidence.

## Summary of Prosecution’s Submissions

45     The Prosecution’s arguments were set out in the “Prosecution’s Closing Submissions”. Essentially, the Prosecution’s position was that the accused had caused hurt to the victim in the manner alleged in the charge, and that he had done so with intention to cause hurt. There was also no grave and sudden provocation leading up to the assault. The main elements of the Prosecution’s submissions are outlined below

46     At the onset, the Prosecution highlighted that it was not in dispute that the accused had hit the victim four to five times on the victim’s helmet, and that the accused had punched the victim at a fast speed.[^20] The only dispute was in the manner in which the accused had hit the victim’s helmet, and whether his fist had made contact with the victim’s mouth. The victim had testified that the accused had indeed punched him on the left and right side of his helmet, and that one of the accused’s punches had landed on his mouth, while the accused’s version, given only during cross-examination, was that he had hammered down on the victim’s helmet, and had not punched or hit the victim on the mouth.

47     The Prosecution submitted that the victim’s account should be believed taking into account the victim’s demeanour, the internally consistency of his evidence, and the fact that it was corroborated by external evidence.

> (a)     As regards the victim’s demeanour, the Prosecution submitted that the victim had candidly admitted hurling vulgarities and pointing his middle finger at the accused, even though these facts were plainly unfavourable to him.

> (b)     Further, the victim’s account was cogent and internally consistent. In this regard, he had maintained the same account - that the accused had punched him four to five times on his helmet and once on his right bottom lip - from the time he made the police report, to the time he spoke to Sgt Chua and to the examining doctor, and also when he testified in court.

> (c)     In addition, the victim’s evidence was corroborated by photograph P6 taken of the damage caused to the victim’s helmet by the accused, photograph P5 showing the cut on the victim’s right lower lip and the blood stain below his lip, and photograph P7 showing the blood stains on the victim’s helmet visor. Further, the evidence of Sgt Chua concerning what he had seen of the accused’s injury, and Dr Looi’s evidence, about the cut and contusion on the victim’s lip, supported the victim’s account.

48     The Prosecution argued that, in contrast, the accused’s evidence was internally inconsistent and did not cohere with the extrinsic evidence. In particular, the claims made by the accused that he had only hammered the top of the victim’s helmet, but had not punched him on the face or lips, was inconsistent with various parts of his long statement P9, and with his cautioned statement P10. It was also inconsistent with extrinsic evidence such as the damage found on the side cap of the victim’s helmet, and the actual injury suffered by the victim on his right lower lip. Moreover, the accused’s account in court was not put to the victim. This was in breach of the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67.

49     As for the _mens rea_ element, the Prosecution argued that the accused had caused hurt with the requisite intention to do so, since each punch involved some degree of force, and the accused had punched the victim several times.

50     As for the hurt that was caused, it was undisputed that the victim had suffered a cut as a result of the accused’s assault. The victim was also not bleeding before the accused hit him, even though the accused claimed that the bleeding was not directly caused by him hitting the victim. [^21]

51     In addition, the Prosecution argued that the defence of grave and sudden provocation was not available to the accused, bearing in mind the guidance of the Court of Appeal (CA) in _Pathip Selvan s/o Sugumaran v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 453</span> (“_Pathip_”).

52     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that, contrary to the accused’s claims, the victim did not retaliate by throwing punches at the accused. This could be seen not only from the victim’s denial in court, but also from the fact that the accused himself had made no mention of these claims in his long statement P9.

## Decision on whether the charge was made out

53     Based on the charge tendered against the accused, there were three main issues that had to be decided:

> (a)     Whether the accused had caused hurt to the victim by punching the victim four to five times on his helmet and once on his mouth;

> (b)     If so, whether the hurt was caused voluntarily i.e. with the intention of causing hurt to the victim, or with the knowledge that he was likely thereby to cause hurt to the accused; and

> (c)     Whether hurt was caused on grave and sudden provocation, to the person who gave the provocation.

### Whether the accused caused hurt to the victim in the manner alleged

54     As correctly put forward by the Prosecution, it was not disputed that the accused had hit the victim four to five times on the victim’s helmet, and that he had hit him at a fast speed. This was the evidence of the victim, and also that of the accused who admitted as much when he testified.

55     However, as noted by the Prosecution, what was in dispute was how the accused had struck the victim’s helmet, and also whether he had actually punched the victim’s mouth as alleged in the charge. In this regard, the victim and the accused gave starkly different accounts; the victim alleged that the accused had punched him on his helmet using left and right hooks, and that one of these punches had landed on his mouth, while the accused’s version was that he had only hit the victim on the top of his helmet. In court, the accused demonstrated how he allegedly hit the victim by showing that he had used the bottom of his clenched fist to hammer down on the top of the victim’s helmet, without his hand coming into contact with the victim’s mouth.[^22]

#### Victim’s account of assault was credible, consistent and corroborated

56     Having carefully reviewed the accounts of both the victim and the accused, I was of the view that the evidence clearly supported the victim’s version of events. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that the victim was a credible witness, whose testimony was highly believable and both internally consistent and corroborated by external evidence. In contrast, I noted a complete lack of corroboration or consistency in what the accused had stated. I thus had no hesitation in accepting the victim’s account of what had transpired.

57     First, I agreed that the victim was forthright, and did not attempt to downplay his role or portray himself as an angel. Instead, the victim had candidly admitted in court to behaviour that painted him in a bad light, such as hurling vulgarities at the accused, and showing the accused the middle finger. All these actions of the victim preceded the accused’s action of stopping his lorry, and subsequently confronting and assaulting the victim.

58     Second, the victim’s evidence that he was punched by the accused, and that he suffered a cut on his lip as a result, was consistently maintained by him, in all the accounts that he made soon after the incident occurred. Indeed, from his first police report P4, to his evidence given to the police witness, Sgt Chua who had attended to him that same evening, and also in his account to the doctor, Dr Khan, that same night, the victim had maintained that he was hit by the accused using his fist, and that he suffered an injury as a result. Specifically:

> (a)     In his first information report (FIR - P4), which was made on 26th March 2018, the victim had reported to the Police about the hurt caused to him by the accused, when he stated: “Lorry Guy Punch Me. My Lips Got Cut”.

> (b)     Soon afterwards, and again on the same date of the assault (26th March 2018), the victim had informed Sgt Chua that the accused had punched him with his left and right hand, and one of these punches had landed on the mouth area.

> (c)     When he was then told to go for a medical examination, the victim was seen by Dr Farid Khan at CGH on 26th March 2018. There, he had told the doctor about the assault (by the accused) on him. As could be seen from the doctor’s consultation notes (D1), Dr Khan had recorded that the victim was hit on the face a few times with a fist, and that because he was wearing a helmet, there was no direct head injury.

> (d)     While Dr Khan was not able to be called to elaborate on the exact words spoken by the victim to him, nevertheless, and contrary to counsel’s submission otherwise, it was clear that what Dr Khan had recorded in D1 i.e. that the victim had informed him that “Driver hit him a few times on the face with his fists”, was broadly in line with what the victim had stated in the FIR P4 (see \[58(a)\] above), and also what he had earlier informed Sgt Chua (see \[22\] and \[58(b)\] above).

59     I would add that the victim gave essentially the same version of affairs – about how the accused had assaulted and caused hurt to him - when he testified in court. Indeed, the victim steadfastly maintained this same account, when questioned by both the Prosecution and the Defence.

60     Third, aside from his credible account in court, and the consistency of his evidence, I would add that the victim’s account was externally consistent and corroborated by other evidence adduced by the Prosecution.

> (a)     For one, I agreed with the Prosecution that the photographs taken on the date of the assault corroborated the victim’s account, in the following manner:

>> (i)       Photograph P6, which showed the victim’s helmet without its side cap, supported the victim’s evidence that the accused had punched him on the left side on his helmet, causing the side cap to fly off.

>> (ii)       Photograph P5 showed the cut on the victim’s right lower lip and the blood stain below his lip, which supported his evidence that the accused had punched him on the mouth, resulting in a cut and bleeding.

>> (iii)       The wide distribution of the blood stains on the victim’s helmet visor, as shown in photograph P7, suggested that the victim had been punched from the left and right side, and not from the top of his helmet.

> (b)     Another source of external corroboration came from Sgt Chua’s evidence. He not only testified as to what the victim had said to him soon after the assault, Sgt Chua himself observed a cut on the victim’s lip and blood stains on the victim’s helmet visor, which were consistent with the victim’s account.

> (c)     Finally, not only did Dr Farid Khan’s consultation notes (D1) support the victim’s account, the opinion of Dr Looi was also that the cut on the victim’s right lower lip and the contusion on his lip were consistent with the victim’s account that he had been punched.

61     All in all, there were compelling reasons for accepting the victim’s evidence that the accused had punched the victim four to five times on his helmet and once on his mouth, as set out in the charge.

#### Accused’s account was unbelievable and refuted by external evidence

62     In contrast to the clear and credible account of the victim, which was corroborated by the external evidence discussed above, the accused’s testimony was simply not believable. Not only was his version refuted by the victim’s evidence and the corroborative facts adduced, it was also clear that the accused’s testimony was undermined by his own evidence given in his police statements.

63     In this regard, as correctly pointed out by the Prosecution, the accused’s account (under cross-examination) that he had only used the bottom of his clenched fist to hit the top of the victim’s helmet but had not punched the victim on the face or on the lips, was not stated in any of his statements, even though all of the accused’s statements were recorded much earlier and closer in time to the date of the incident, than his testimony in court. Specifically:

> (a)     In his long statement P9 at \[4\], the accused had stated that: “In total, I punched his helmet for about 4-5 times. I understand that it had caused him to bleed because the impact had injured him.”

> (b)     Further, in his cautioned statement P10, after the charge and notice of warning were read to the accused, the latter had also stated that he “plead\[s\] guilty” and was “sorry that \[he\] resorted to those actions”.[^23]

64     In addition, not only did the accused not mention in either of these statements that he had hit the victim only on the top of the victim’s helmet with the bottom of the accused’s clenched fist, I also agreed with the Prosecution that during the accused’s examination-in-chief, when his counsel read out the portion in his long statement P9 about his punching the victim on the victim’s helmet, the accused did not dispute the accuracy of this part of his statement.[^24] Nor did the accused claim that rather than punch the victim, he had “hammered” down on the top of the victim’s helmet.

65     Indeed, it was only during cross-examination, that the accused claimed to have hit the victim on the top of his helmet and demonstrated this by using the bottom of his clenched fists to hammer downwards.[^25] The accused’s belated claim was apparently only made to explain how it was that it was “impossible” for him to have punched the victim’s mouth.[^26] However, making such a delayed and uncorroborated claim in those circumstances, made his evidence contrived and quite unbelievable.

66     Further, not only was the accused’s “cross-examination version” different from his earlier accounts, as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, his belated version was also inconsistent with the external evidence, such as the photograph showing damage to the side cap of the victim’s helmet, which suggested that the force was directed at the side of the helmet (as testified by the victim) rather than from the top; as well as inconsistent with the cut on the victim’s lip, all of which the accused had admitted were caused by his attack.[^27]

67     Further, when asked to explain how the victim had sustained the bleeding on his lip, the accused then speculated that the victim might have bitten his own lip, without providing any basis for such a claim. Indeed, I would add that contrary to the accused’s bare and unreasoned conjecture, the close proximity in time between the accused striking the victim with his hands, and the bleeding of the victim’s lip that occurred, as well as the lack of any intervening cause, made it quite clear that the two events – the accused’s assault on the victim, and the injury that resulted thereafter - were connected in terms of cause and effect.

68     Furthermore, I noted that the accused, despite being represented by counsel, did not put to the victim that he had hit the victim by using the bottom of his clenched fist to strike or hammer the top of the victim’s helmet, as opposed to landing hook punches on the left and right side of the victim’s helmet, which was the victim’s account. Nor was it put to the victim that the accused did not punch the victim once on his mouth area.[^28] As rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, the failure to question or challenge the victim on these crucial matters, breaches the rule in _Browne v Dunn_, and suggested that the Defence should not be allowed to make such claims in its submissions.

69     While the accused also tried to argue that the relative lack of serious injuries on the victim’s face supported his account that he had not struck the victim in the manner alleged by the victim, I rejected this claim of the accused as well. In this regard, as it was not disputed that the victim was wearing a helmet at the time the accused struck him on his head and face, the relative lack of serious injuries suffered by the victim was perhaps best explained by Dr Khan in his consultation notes (D1). Dr Khan had stated that because the victim was wearing a helmet, there was no direct head injury to him. I would add that Dr Khan’s assessment was supported by Dr Looi who had similarly opined that the lack of injuries on the victim could have been because the victim was wearing a helmet and this may have shielded the impact.[^29]

70     In short, having carefully evaluated the evidence, I was of the view that the evidence overwhelmingly pointed to the accused having assaulted the victim in the manner set out in the charge, causing him to be hurt in the process.

### Whether hurt was caused voluntarily

71     Moving on to the second element of the offence i.e. whether the accused had voluntarily caused hurt, section 321 of the Penal Code was instructive. This provision reads:

> Whoever does any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person, and does thereby cause hurt to any person, is said “voluntarily to cause hurt”.

72     On the facts of the present case, it was clear that the accused had voluntarily struck the victim at least four to five times in the head and helmet region with his hands. The accused had done this deliberately, and had struck with both his left and right hands, in quick succession, such that the victim was not able to avoid the blows. The accused had also admitted that he had assaulted the victim while the latter was still sitting on his motorcycle.[^30]

73     In addition, in his long statement P9 at paragraph 4, the accused had admitted that it was only after his assault, that the victim started to bleed. In the same paragraph, the accused also said that he ceased his actions as he “…felt a little worried because \[he\] knew that this might bring \[him\] trouble”.

74     Further, there was clear evidence from the victim, from Sgt Chua, from Dr Looi, from the medical report and Dr Khan’s clinical notes, as well as from the photographs produced in court and from the accused’s statements, that the victim suffered bleeding on his lip and also pain following the accused’s attack.

75     Clearly, by using his fists and directing his attacks in quick succession and with force at the helmet, and at the head/face regions of the victim, when the latter was essentially a sitting target on a stationary motorcycle that had stopped at the red light, there can be no doubt that the accused’s assault was done with the intention of causing hurt, or at the very least, with knowledge that he would likely thereby cause hurt to the victim.

76     In other words, I was satisfied that not only was hurt caused by the accused to the victim, such hurt was clearly voluntarily caused.

### Whether hurt was caused on grave and sudden provocation

77     It was clear from the evidence adduced that the assault arose out of an immediate prior incident on the road between the accused, a lorry driver, and the victim, a motorcyclist, where the latter essentially felt that the accused’s lorry had nearly collided into his motorcycle. This brought about an angry exchange between them which, in turn, caused the accused to also stop his lorry when he saw the victim’s motorcycle stop at a red light. The accused had then gone towards the victim to confront him. In court, the accused agreed that at that point, he was “sufficiently angry at the victim that \[he would\] leave \[his\] lorry parked at a slip road, walk across 3 lanes to question \[the victim\].”[^31] This was followed by an angry exchange between them.

78     The accused claimed that he then disengaged and turned around intending to return to his lorry. The accused claimed that he only turned back to punch the victim when he heard the latter utter vulgarities at him and his mother. These vulgarities, the defence argued, constituted grave and sudden provocation from the victim, which led to the accused assaulting the victim.

79     However, I was of the view that the accused failed to prove that the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation actually applied in this case.

80     In this regard, the CA in _Pathip_ had explained at \[34\] that there were two distinct requirements for the accused to prove before the defence can apply:

> First, it must be shown that the accused was deprived of self-control by the provocation (‘the subjective test’). Secondly, the provocation must be grave and sudden, and it has to be determined whether an ordinary person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to lose self-control (‘the objective test’).

81     Further, in its judgment:

> (a)     In respect of the subjective test, the CA had endorsed the definition of loss of self-control set out in _Regina v Duffy_ \[1949\] 1 All ER 932 as “…sudden and temporary loss of self-control, rendering the accused so subject to passion as to make him or her for the moment not master of his \[_sic_\] mind” (at \[35\]).

> (b)     As for the objective test, the conduct of the accused must be assessed by reference to the reasonable person with a broadly similar background. There were two types of characteristics which the court could take into account: characteristics affecting a similarly placed reasonable man’s level of self-control and characteristics affecting the gravity of the provocation. However, an accused’s exceptional hot temper alone should not be taken to exonerate an exceedingly violent response (at \[51\]).

> (c)     In addition, citing _Mahmood v State_ AIR 1961 All 538, the CA accepted that the criterion “sudden” should also mean that the provocation was unexpected, and the interval between the provocation and the commission of the offence must be brief (at \[46\]).

82     On the facts of the present case, I was of the view that this accused had clearly failed to prove this partial defence on the facts, certainly not beyond a balance of probabilities as he was required to do.[^32]

> (a)     First, while the accused claimed in court that he was already disengaging from the victim just before the assault, and that it was only when he heard the victim utter vulgarities directed at him and his mother that he lost his self-control and struck the victim, this version of affairs was quite different from that of the victim. The latter’s account was simply that after the accused confronted him, the accused struck him in the course of their argument. There was never any sign that the accused was seeking to disengage from the victim before he assaulted the latter. In fact, considering the actions of the accused in stopping his vehicle at the roadside after his unhappy experience with the victim just moments earlier, and his traversing several lanes, in a state of anger, to confront the victim at the red light, and doing so just to demand an explanation from the victim for the latter’s perceived belligerent behaviour, and then not getting a satisfactory response from the victim, I was more inclined to believe the victim’s account that the accused followed up immediately by assaulting him, rather than try to turn away as the accused had claimed. Further, in preferring the victim’s account over that of the accused, I would reiterate my earlier observations about the accused’s lack of credibility, as compared to the victim’s convincing evidence.

> (b)     Second, even if one accepted the accused’s version, it could hardly be argued that the vulgarities uttered by the victim amount to “sudden” provocation within the meaning of this defence, since hitherto the victim had already used vulgarities on the accused, and had even pointed his middle finger at the latter, well before the accused decided to stop his lorry to query the victim. In other words, there was nothing “sudden” or “unexpected” about the victim uttering further vulgarities at the accused, especially when the latter was the one who stopped his lorry and confronted the victim, after the victim was already minding his own business as he had moved on, and away from the initial point of conflict with the accused on the road.

> (c)     Third, the evidence also did not show that the accused was in fact deprived of self-control by the alleged vulgarities, such as to make him “not master of his mind” (within the meaning accepted at \[35\] of _Pathip_). Instead, the accused showed sufficient presence of mind to stop hitting the victim when he saw blood on the victim’s mouth (see paragraph 4 of his long statement P9) and upon the intervention of the third party. He was also clear headed enough to immediately leave the scene, enter his lorry and drive away.

> (d)     Fourth, in any event, it was also not shown by the accused that objectively, an ordinary person of the same sex and age as him, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to lose his self-control. In other words, even if vulgarities had indeed been uttered by the victim in the manner claimed by the accused, the accused had failed to show that these vulgarities would have objectively amounted to ‘grave’ provocation, such as to afford him the benefit of this defence.

83     In short, this was not a case where the defence of grave and sudden provocation had been made out, such as to reduce the charge from one under section 323 of the Penal Code to one under section 334.

### Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt

84     For completeness, I note that the accused also alleged that the victim attempted to retaliate against the accused by throwing punches at the latter.

85     To this claim, I would first state that such an assertion was strictly not relevant to the charge, since any such “retaliation” would have occurred after the offence had already been committed. In other words, retaliation by the victim, even if had been shown, would not change the fact that the elements of the offence under section 323 would already have been made out.

86     In any event, I was also of the view that the evidence did not in fact support the accused’s claim of any attempted retaliation by the victim.

> (a)     First, while the accused claimed in court that the victim had tried to hit back after he was assaulted by the accused, and the accused also claimed that he had managed to evade the victim’s “retaliatory punches”, there was no mention in the accused’s statement P9 of either of these alleged occurrences. In fact, what the accused stated at paragraph 5 of in P9 (recorded on 28 March 2018) was that “**_The said motorcyclist did not hit me at all_**.” When the accused was confronted with these discrepancies, the accused claimed that he had told the statement recorder to write these allegations down, but that the latter said that there was no need to. However, this serious allegation was not put to the statement recorder, IO Melvin, when he was on the stand. Thus, I agreed with the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“the DPP”) that the belated nature of the accused’s allegation showed that this was a mere afterthought that could not be believed.

> (b)     Second, in his subsequent cautioned statement P10, recorded on 14 March 2019, the accused had also made no mention of the victim trying to strike him or attempting to fight back.

> (c)     Third, the victim also refuted the accused’s claims. The victim said that after he was struck by the accused, he suffered pain on his head, face and lip, and also became dizzy as a result. He did not retaliate as the accused was bigger than he was, although he did swing his arms in a defensive manner “…to get away from it”[^33]. Despite his efforts, “nothing stopped”.[^34] In addition, the victim denied counsel’s suggestion that he came down from his motorcycle and fought with the accused who held onto his two hands.[^35] The victim also denied that the incident stopped when the accused released the victim’s hands and walked away, and not because of any third party intervention.

87     Finally, for completeness, while counsel suggested that the victim’s helmet, a crucial piece of evidence, was deliberately disposed of, with respect, there was really no basis for making such an unsubstantiated claim. This was especially so since photographs had already been taken by the police of the helmet soon after the incident, and there was no suggestion that those photographs had been doctored, or that the photographs misrepresented the condition of the helmet in any way. Indeed, as pointed out earlier in this judgment, those photographs showed that there was damage on the side of the helmet, which was evidence that corroborated the victim’s account. Indeed, that the helmet was in a damaged condition post-assault, was also implicitly acknowledged by the accused, when at paragraph 6 of his long statement P9, he even offered to pay for a new helmet for the victim, or to compensate for the value of that helmet.

88     Thus, in summary, having carefully reviewed the evidence and the submissions of parties, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted the accused accordingly.

## Sentencing Phase

89     In respect of the charge under s 323 of the Penal Code for an offence committed on 26th March 2018, the prescribed punishment was a term of imprisonment which may extend to 2 years, or a fine which may extend to $5,000, or both.

90     The accused did not have any similar antecedents, although he was traced for committing mischief in 1990, and also has numerous drug-related convictions in 2003.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

91     The Prosecution submitted that at least six weeks’ imprisonment should be imposed. The crux of its submission was that this was a road rage case as defined in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Yee Hua and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 308</span> (“_Lim Yee Hua”_) at \[25\], and that “general and specific deterrence is the primary sentencing consideration in road rage cases”. In this regard, the DPP pointed out that our roads “…are progressively becoming more crowded each month, as more and more cars add to the traffic, and motorists must simply learn to live with one another. There can be no place on our roads for road bullies.”[^36] She also highlighted that due to the close proximity of citizens to one another in Singapore, the preservation of order and harmony was the more important.

92     The Prosecution also pointed out that in line with the sentencing approach laid down in _Lim Yee Hua_ at \[26\] - \[27\], the court should consider the following two parameters when sentencing: (a) the harm caused by the offence; and (b) the culpability of the offender. In this regard, the Prosecution argued that:

> (a)     As regards the harm caused, this case fell in the upper end of the low-harm category, in terms of the cut on the victim’s right lower lip, which caused him to bleed, as well as the pain on his face, head and lip. There was also damage caused to the victim’s helmet, and inconvenience that resulted to other road users during the incident.

> (b)     As regards the accused’s culpability, it should be assessed to be at least moderate as:

>> (i)       He had displayed thuggish behaviour, and went out of his way to initiate and effect a face-to-face confrontation with the victim by leaving his lorry unattended at the slip road and walking across three lanes on New Upper Changi Road angrily towards the victim, despite the presence of oncoming traffic;

>> (ii)       The accused had reacted disproportionately to the vulgarities uttered by the victim by punching him _multiple times_, and targeting his head, a vulnerable part of his body; and

>> (iii)       The assault was entirely one-sided and at no time did the victim retaliate by hitting the accused.

93     Further, the DPP pointed out that the accused had demonstrated no remorse. Instead, he had fled the scene, claimed trial, and made spurious allegations against the victim. alleging that the latter retaliated by punching him back, something that he never mentioned in his statements. This offence was also not the accused’s first brush with the law.

94     In addition, the Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents consisting of six road-rage case involving offenders who were convicted after they had pleaded guilty, or after a trial. The sentences imposed in those cases ranged from 3 weeks to 6 weeks’ imprisonment. In essence, all the offenders and victims in those cases were either drivers or passengers in vehicles, and the assaults were committed after some unhappiness and conflict between the offenders and victims, arising from disputes over the use of the roads. In all the cited cases, the victims suffered minor injuries, and the offenders either had no antecedents, or had essentially unrelated antecedents.

95     In respect of the precedent cases, the Prosecution urged me to consider, in particular, the sentence imposed in _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Samudra bin Sjamsir_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 47</span> (“_Muhammad Samudra bin Sjamsir_”).

96     There, the offender had driven a vehicle that entered a main road suddenly from a side road, and had cut into the victim’s path, causing the latter to jam his brakes to avoid an accident. The victim then flashed his headlights at the offender. Following this, the offender, as if to provoke the victim, drove in a stop-start manner on the left-most lane of the road, causing the victim, who remained in the lane behind the offender, to have to do the same. The offender then suddenly came to a complete stop. Not wanting to get in front of the offender and continue on his journey lest the offender followed him to his residence, the victim stopped behind. The offender then got off his car and went to confront the victim. He beat on the window on the driver’s side and when the victim lowered the window, the offender immediately threw a punch at the victim’s face, causing him to sustain a small upper lip puncture wound/abrasion. The offender was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment. His conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal.

97     The Prosecution argued that the facts of that case were similar to the present case in that (a) the victims in both cases sustained a minor injury on their lips; (b) the offenders in both cases had gone out of their way to initiate confrontation with the respective victims; (c) both offenders had reacted disproportionately to slight provocation by the victims; and (d) both offenders had claimed trial to their respective charges. Further, while the offender in _Muhammad Samudra bin Sjamsir_ had provoked the victim before the confrontation, this was counter-balanced by the fact that the accused in present case had punched the victim four to five times, while the offender in _Muhammad Samudra bin Sjamsir_ had only landed one punch. In addition, the harm caused in the present case was arguably higher than in _Muhammad Samudra bin Sjamsir_, as the accused here had also caused damage to the victim’s helmet and the assault brought much inconvenience to other road users.

98     Aside from seeking the same six weeks’ imprisonment term that was imposed in _Muhammad Samudra bin Sjamsir_, the Prosecution also sought a compensation order of $120 in the present case. This was the amount incurred by the victim for his hospital expenses.

### Mitigation Plea and Defence’s reply

99     In his mitigation plea, counsel repeated many of the same arguments that he had put forward when submitting that the Prosecution had not established its case against the accused. Amongst other things, counsel insisted that the accused did not hit the victim on his face, even as he admitted that the accused had punched the victim four or five times on his helmet after the victim had allegedly insulted him and his mother. Counsel also insisted that the victim was not a credible witness and that it was he who had initiated the entire episode.

100    In addition, counsel insisted that this was not a road rage case, without explaining how he came to this conclusion. He also claimed that the accused had been very remorseful as could be seen from what he had stated in his long statement and cautioned statement. Finally, counsel submitted that a fine would be an appropriate punishment, and indicated that the accused would also make payment of the $120.00 compensation sum as requested.

## Court’s Decision on Sentence

101    In _Lim Yee Hua_, Chan Seng Onn J had explained what amounts to road rage violence. At \[25\], his Honour had stated:

> In my view, an incident of violence should be labelled as an episode of road rage violence only **_where the facts disclose violence perpetrated by road users as a result of real or perceived slights by other road users stemming from differences that arise in the course of the shared used of our roads. The litmus test_** for whether the deterrent sentencing policy associated with road rage offences should apply for a particular offence of violence **_is thus whether the violence originates from differences arising through common road use_**. In other words, the harsh deterrent sanctions for road rage incidents only apply **_when road users engage in violence specifically over disputes that arise from the shared use of our roads._** It follows that where incidents of violence happen to break out on the roads, but the cause of the violence has no nexus to the parties shared use of the roads, the road rage deterrent sentencing should not apply.

\[emphasis added\]

102    In the present case, the accused had claimed trial to his charge. In the course of the evidence being adduced, it was clear that the entire incident arose because of unhappiness between the accused and the victim “….stemming from differences that arise in the course of the shared used of \[the\] roads”.

> (a)     In this regard, the accused had driven his lorry into the victim’s lane in such a manner that it almost caused a collision with the latter who was on his motorcycle. This incident had occurred when both of them were essentially trying to drive on the same lane of the road. Following this near collision, angry words and gestures were exchanged.

> (b)     The dispute then continued with the accused deliberately stopping his lorry a short distance away. In an angry state, the accused then crossed three lanes to where the victim was and confronted him over what had just happened between them on the roads.

> (c)     Thereafter, following further exchanges between them, it was not disputed that the accused had struck the victim, resulting in the hurt caused by him to the victim.

> (d)     In the circumstances, and using the words of Justice Chan, this was one clear case “….when road users engage in violence specifically over disputes that arise from the shared use of our roads.” In other words, this was, without doubt, a road rage case.

103    That of course was not the end of the matter, since the mere fact that a case involved road rage violence, does not automatically mean that the offender has necessarily to be subjected to a custodial sentence. Instead, I had to consider the harm caused and the culpability of the offender, and any other relevant sentencing consideration that may be aggravating or mitigating in nature. At \[27\] of _Lim Yee Hua_, Justice Chan had provided the following guidance:

> The sentencing considerations that generally inform the sentencing of offences under s 323 of the Penal Code are trite. The court should first consider the two principal parameters of: (a) the _harm_ caused by the offence, which is a measure of the injury that has been caused by the commission of the offence, and is measured in terms of the magnitude of the infringement of the legally protected interests which are implicated; and (b) the _culpability_ of the offender, which is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions, and is measured in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act.

104    Expanding on these guidelines further at \[27\], Justice Chan added that:

> The harm caused by the offence would invoke the considerations of the nature and degree of: (a) personal injury directly sustained by the victim, (b) collateral harm or damage caused to other persons or property respectively, and (c) disruption or distress caused to the public. On the other hand, the culpability of the offender would primarily involve an assessment of the manner in which the assault was carried out (_eg_, the duration of the assault, whether the attacks were one-sided or aimed at a vulnerable part of the body, or whether a weapon was used). Following this, the court should then take into consideration the applicable aggravating and mitigating factors that may not relate to the commission of the offence _per se_ in order to arrive at a sentence that best fits the facts (_eg_, whether the offender is a first-time offender, whether the offender pleaded guilty and whether the offender has shown remorse in any other way).

105    Accordingly in the present case, as far as harm was concerned, in line with the guidance of Justice Chan, I noted that: (a) the personal injury directly sustained by the victim was relatively slight, in the nature of a cut on his lip and the pain that he had suffered; (b) in terms of collateral harm, there was damage caused to the victim’s helmet which had to be replaced; and (c) in terms of disruption or distress caused to the public, while there was evidence of inconvenience caused to other road users, this did not appear to be very significant since the entire episode apparently did not last very long, and the accused and the victim left the scene soon after it happened. On the whole, I agreed that the harm caused by the accused was relatively low.

106    As for the culpability of the accused, based on the guidance of Justice Chan, it was clear that the accused had initiated the confrontation with the victim, and that he had attacked the victim on a vulnerable part of the body i.e. the head. Further, the accused had struck the victim suddenly and in quick succession, giving the victim little chance to react or to defend himself, and the accused’s attack only ceased upon the intervention of a third party. The assault was also entirely one-sided. I was thus of the view that the accused’s culpability was on the higher end of low, trending towards moderate culpability.

107    As for other sentencing considerations, I noted that the accused had claimed trial. This meant that there would be no sentencing discount that may otherwise have applied if he had pleaded guilty and demonstrated remorse. In fact, I would add that the manner in which the trial was conducted, including the submissions made by counsel, evidenced no sign of remorse on the part of the accused at all. Further, with respect, there was nothing in the mitigation plea tendered by counsel that successfully identified any significant mitigating factor in the accused’s favour.

108    As for the sentencing precedents tendered, I considered the case of _Muhammad Samudra bin Sjamsir_, and the Prosecution’s argument that a sentence similar to the six weeks’ imprisonment sentence imposed in that case should also be imposed here. However, I was of the view that the offender in _Muhammad Samudra bin Sjamsir_ had displayed greater persistence and aggression following the near accident on the road that preceded the assault. As such, the culpability of the accused here could be regarded as lower than that of the offender in _Muhammad Samudra bin Sjamsir_.

109    Instead, I found the sentence imposed _in PP v Neo Hong Chye_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGMC 14</span> (“_Neo Hong Chye”_), another claimed trial case that was cited by the Prosecution, to be a more useful guide. In _Neo Hong Chye_, the male victim, who was 62 years old, was driving his lorry when the offender, who was driving a pick-up, cut into his lane without signalling. The victim shouted at the offender and scolded vulgarities at him for nearly causing an accident. The offender then alighted from his pick-up and approached the victim’s lorry, before pulling the victim out of the lorry and causing the latter to fall on the road. The offender then punched the victim once on his face before returning to his pick-up and driving off. The victim suffered two broken front teeth, a shaky right incisor, and a laceration on the right upper lip. In the course of the trial, the offender, who had no prior antecedents, made false allegations against the victim, calling him a gangster. He also coached a witness to give false evidence

110    In the present case, the victim similarly scolded vulgarities at the accused, after a near accident on the road caused by the accused’s manner of driving. It was also the accused who deliberately approached the victim, and struck the latter on his face. While there was only one blow inflicted in _Neo Hong Chye_, compared to the four to five punches inflicted in the present case, this was counter-balanced by the somewhat less serious injuries suffered by the victim here, as compared to those suffered by the victim in _Neo Hong Chye._

111    Aside from the above two mentioned precedents, I also considered the sentences of three and four weeks’ imprisonment imposed on the offenders in the other cases cited by the Prosecution, taking into account the fact that they all involved offenders who had pleaded guilty rather than claim trial.

112    All things considered, and having looked in particular at the sentencing considerations set out in _Lim Yee Hua_, and the precedent cases cited, I was of the view that a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment would be fair and proportionate. I also ordered the accused to pay compensation of $120 to the victim, in default one day’s imprisonment, for the medical expenses incurred by the victim arising from the assault.

113    The accused being dissatisfied has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He has, however, paid the compensation sum. The accused is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.
