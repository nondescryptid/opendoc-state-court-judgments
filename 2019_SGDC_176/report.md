28 August 2019

### District Judge Diana Haven Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused was charged with an offence under section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”) for voluntarily causing hurt to one Leow Suat Hong (“the victim”) by means of a heated substance, by using a ladle to splash hot water at her at least 3 times, causing her to sustain 1st degree burns on her upper chest, right loin and left arm and 2nd degree burns with a blister over her left breast areola region.

2       The accused claimed trial.

3       Having heard the evidence and arguments, I found that the Prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and acquitted the accused. The Prosecution being dissatisfied with my decision, has filed their Notice of Appeal against the acquittal. Accordingly, I set out my reasons for acquittal.

## BACKGROUND

4       The accused was at the material time, a stall assistant at a fish ball noodles stall. There is evidence that the accused was a hard working stall assistant, a quiet person who kept largely to herself and who had no issues with any of the other stall holders.

5       The victim, a stall owner of a prawn noodle stall is a friend of the accused’s boss, PW2 – Mr Sim Kok Soon (“Uncle Sim”). Uncle Sim allows the victim to take ingredients from his stall. The victim would frequently enter the fish ball noodles stall to take, borrow ingredients or retrieve her stuff from the fridge. Before the incident resulting in hurt, the accused had always given way or allowed the victim access to the ingredients in the fish ball noodle stall.

6       The accused and the victim did not speak to each other before the incident.

7       On the material day, the victim was upset with the accused as she was of the view that the accused was pointing at her and gossiping about her with others. The victim wanted to take or borrow some ingredients. The victim also wanted to confront the accused and ask why the accused does not like her or why the accused was pointing at her earlier that morning.

8       The victim duly confronted the accused.

9       At the material time, the accused was taking her wallet from a bag and getting ready to go for her coffee break.

10     The victim confronted the accused and pointed at the accused. The accused became angry. The victim wanted thereafter to access the fridge. The accused refused this time and pushed the victim. The victim resisted. In the scuffle which ensued, the victim who was holding a red bowl, hit the accused. The accused then used a ladle and splashed water in the victim’s direction 3 times. Some of the water landed on the victim. The victim sustained injuries. This entire incident (confrontation and hurt) was over in a matter of a few minutes and was captured by CCTV (see CCTV footage at Exhibit P10).

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

11     The Prosecution’s case is that this “_was a vicious one way assault by the accused on the victim.”_[^1] In support of its case, the Prosecution asserts in essence, the following:

> a.     The relationship between the accused and the victim was an unfriendly, hostile or strained one. The accused did not like the victim because the victim would borrow things but not return them. The victim on the other hand, vehemently denies borrowing/taking the items;[^2]

> b.     There was a staring incident which subsequently brought about an argument between the accused and the victim and sparked off the accused’s anger;[^3]

> c.     The accused then assaulted the victim;[^4]

> d.     Prior to the assault, the accused threatened to splash hot water at the victim;[^5]

> e.     The accused chased after the victim after splashing hot water at her;[^6] and

> f.     The water was hot.[^7]

## THE DEFENCE’S CASE

12     The Defence’s case is that the accused did not possess the necessary _mens rea_.[^8] The accused did not intend to cause hurt to the victim or did not subjectively know that her actions were likely to cause harm to the victim.[^9]

13     Alternatively, the accused is exercising her right of private defence after:

> a.     the victim verbally threatened to hit her;

> b.     the victim encroached into the accused’s space despite the accused telling the victim to leave;

> c.     the victim struck the accused’s head with a red bowl; and

> d.     perceiving that she would be struck by the victim again.[^10]

14     Further and/or in the alternative, the accused is entitled to the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation and that the charge should be amended to one under section 334 of the Penal Code.[^11]

## THE MAIN ISSUE – _MENS REA_

15     The main issue in this case is whether the accused possessed the necessary _mens rea_ for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt by means of a heated substance.

16     Section 321 of the Penal Code states,

> _“Voluntarily causing hurt_

> _321_.     _Whoever does any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person, and does, thereby cause hurt to any person, is said “voluntarily to cause hurt”.”_

17     The mental element required was that the accused intended or knew it was likely that her actions would cause hurt to the victim. The knowledge required by the section was actual knowledge. The accused had to be subjectively aware of the likelihood of causing hurt. Rashness or negligence was insufficient.[^12]

18     The subjective or actual knowledge of the accused could be inferred from the objective acts and circumstances of the offence.[^13] Some of the facts or essential facts to be taken into account when inferring intention and knowledge include:-

> a.     Whether there is evidence of previous enmity against the party who has suffered;

> b.     Overt act and declarations;

> c.     Amount of violence used;

> d.     Nature of weapon selected for the purpose; and

> e.     Part of body, vital or otherwise, where the wound was inflicted.[^14]

## Objective Acts and Circumstances of the Offence

19     The accused says that there was no intention to cause hurt. She had only intended to chase the victim away from the stall.

20     I turn now to the objective acts and circumstances of the offence to determine whether the accused actually intended to cause hurt or knew that hurt would be caused.

### Whether there is evidence of previous enmity

21     The Prosecution submits, in essence, that that the relationship between the accused and the victim was an unfriendly, hostile or strained one. The accused did not like the victim because the victim would borrow things but not return them. There is some evidence to suggest that the accused may not have been happy with the victim’s habit of taking and not returning things to the stall.

22     The accused and the victim do not talk or speak to each other.

23     Even then however, the accused would just move aside and allow the victim to take things from the stall on numerous occasions. The accused never resisted or prevented the victim from taking things before the incident.[^15]

24     Hence whilst the accused does not appear to like or to be fond of the victim, she has never demonstrated hatred or a desire to hurt the victim. Prior to the incident, she also had no reason to hurt the victim.

25     In this regard, I note that the victim herself accepted that based on their relationship or lack thereof, there is no reason for the accused to hurt the victim.[^16]

26     The victim also honestly accepted that she does not know whether the accused had an intention or absolutely no intention to cause hurt to her.[^17]

### The gossiping/staring incident, overt Act or declarations

27     The victim was the one who angrily approached or confronted the accused. In the argument that ensued, it is clear that the accused had refused to allow the victim to take any stuff and that the accused had wanted the victim to get out of the stall.

28     The accused had pushed the victim. The victim had however resisted. The bowl which the victim was holding appeared to have hit the victim in the region of the head/face once or twice.

29     The victim alleged that the accused declared and threatened to splash hot water on her. This is denied by the accused. Upon reviewing the CCTV footage, I am of the view that the incident took place so fast (in a matter of seconds) that it is unlikely that such a declaration or threat was made.[^18]

### Amount of violence used and nature of weapon selected

30     I turn to the amount of violence used and the nature of weapon selected to determine whether the accused intended to cause hurt.

31     First and foremost, I note that the whole altercation between the accused and the victim took only about 1 minute. Further, for a good part of the said minute, the parties appear to be exchanging heated words.

32     Although clearly angered, the accused’s first move was to push the victim out of the stall. There was no intention exhibited during the pushing, that the accused wanted to hurt the victim.

33     It was only after being hit (be it unintentionally or otherwise by the victim) that the accused resorted to taking a ladle to splash water on the victim.

34     The time between the accused being hit and splashing at the victim was very brief/short. A matter of seconds and almost in an instant.

35     Three splashes were thrown in the general direction of the accused. The splashes were not dished out in a particularly well thought out or directed manner. It was in quick successions. The first splash hit the victim and/or her plastic bag. It is not clear whether all of the second splash landed on the victim. The victim had run out. The third splash missed the victim completely. After that, the accused stopped.

36     In view of the nature of the weapon selected and the amount of force or manner of splashing exhibited, I am not persuaded that the accused was intent on injuring the victim for the following reasons.

37     If the accused had wanted to hurt the victim after being hit, the quickest, surest, most direct or forceful way would have been to hit the victim with the ladle. Splashing water is an odd choice.

38     The manner in which the accused splashed the water also does not clearly show an intention to cause hurt. The splashes were in quick succession and thrown in the general direction of the victim. The third splash, in particular, lands on the floor and not on the victim at all. This does not look like the splashes of a person intent of injuring another with hot water.

### Whether the Water was Hot and whether the Accused knew that the water was hot

39     In considering the nature of the weapon used and section 324 of the Penal Code, it was important to consider whether the water used to splash the victim was heated.

40     The Prosecution submits that the water was hot. The Accused’s evidence, on the other hand, is that the water was lukewarm or “_half warm cold_”[^19].

41     Uncle Sim gave evidence that the water scooped from the relevant container/tank is usually hot.[^20]

42     Another stall assistant, PW7 – Ms Sim Ai Choo (“Helen”) said that this is water which they would use to warm up their coffee; it was generally hot[^21]. She however agreed that when no one is cooking (as is the case at the material time), depending on the time of the day and whether cold water is flowing into the tank, it can be merely warm[^22].

43     The accused was going for a coffee break. This can be seen by her taking her wallet from her bag. She says that during the material time, the stove will be off otherwise she would be wasting gas. There were no customers and she was not cooking. The stove is off and the water ought not to be hot. The tank which she scooped the water from was further away from the stove/burner underneath. She also says that the cold tap water was running, albeit slowly, into the said tank.[^23]

44     Upon reviewing the CCTV footage, there is some doubt as to the correctness of the accused’s recollection. The water in the other tanks (directly above the stove/burner) appeared to be moving and emitting steam. The stove hence might not have been turned off yet. Due to the positioning of the camera, I am unable to see the tap and whether cold water was running from the tap into the tank. However, if the stove was not turned off yet, the tap is unlikely to be turned off as well. The is no reason to disbelieve the accused and no evidence to show that she was wrong when she says that the tap was still on and cold water was running slowly into the tank.

45     In view of the fact that (i) the accused was no longer cooking at the material time; (ii) the water in the relevant tank was furthest away from the stove/burner and hence, the “least hot”; and (iii) it is more probable than not, that cold tap water was still running slowly into the tank that she scooped water from, the water is unlikely to be boiling hot and may not have been very hot at all. The water could have been just slightly above 44 degree Celsius.

46     Putting aside the actual temperate of the water at the material time and whilst it cannot be denied that the water had to be sufficiently heated (above 44 degree Celsius)[^24] to cause the burns on the victim, in deciding whether the accused had the necessary _mens rea_ to cause hurt by using heated substance, it is important to determine whether the accused was aware that the water was hot or sufficiently hot enough to cause hurt/burns.

47     In this regard, I note that the accused was consistent in maintaining that the water she used was “_half warm cold_”.[^25]

48     The accused’s evidence is further reinforced by what transpired later on the day of the incident. There is no dispute that when asked by the Investigating Officer (“IO”) whether the water in the material tank was hot, the accused scooped a ladle of water, put her finger or fingers into the said scoop to demonstrate that it is not hot or not hot enough to cause any burns.[^26] While I note that the IO himself was of the view that the water was hot, that is not the question for the purpose of determining _mens rea_. In my judgment, the accused’s actions in putting her own finger or fingers into a scoop of the water showed to a large extent her view or belief that the water is only “_half warm cold_”.

49     In the light of the above and the available evidence, I am of the view that the accused believed that the water was only “_half warm cold_” and was not aware and/or did not know that her act of splashing this “_half warm cold_” water would likely cause burns.

### Events immediately after the incident

50     Events immediately after the incident also do not suggest that the accused had an intention to cause hurt. The accused stopped splashing after the victim went away.[^27] The accused even put the ladle back unto the counter top.[^28]

51     The Prosecution asserts that after the victim ran out of the fish ball stall, the accused chased after the victim.[^29] This is not a fair interpretation of the events. The accused had stopped after splashing; she did not pursue the victim when the victim went away. She had only “restarted” upon being further provoked. In this regard, I note that Helen gave evidence that the victim was still scolding the accused and had announced quite loudly that she was going to report the accused to the police.[^30] The victim carried out her “threat” by borrowing a hand phone from the fruit seller and calling the police. As a result of this announcement or further provocation, the accused took the ladle up again and used it to hit the hand phone out of the victim’s hands whilst saying words to the effect that, “_you started the trouble and now you are still trying to get me into trouble.”_.[^31] The hand phone fell to the ground and was damaged. The accused was separately charged for mischief and she had pleaded guilty to the said charge for mischief.

52     If the accused had wanted to hurt the victim with hot water, this subsequent escalation of events or provocation would have tempted or incited the accused to hurt the victim again. The accused however, did not hit/hurt the victim even though she had a convenient weapon or ladle in hand. The accused took aim and had only hit the hand phone; knocking it out of the victim’s hand.

53     The victim alleged that the accused had wanted to hit her with the ladle after hitting the hand phone but was stopped by Helen.[^32] The victim’s allegations were however, not substantiated or supported by the other witness’s evidence. Helen was not asked to give evidence specifically on this point and did not testify that the accused had wanted to hit the victim with the ladle or that she had stopped the accused from hitting the victim with the ladle. PW4 – Ng Chee Hoon, the fruit seller, did not notice, know or pay attention as to what happened after the hand phone was knocked.

54     I pause to note that if the accused had wanted to hurt the victim, she could have just used the ladle to hit the victim right at the outset instead of using it to merely hit or knock the hand phone out of the victim’s hands.

55     The fact that the accused had an opportunity to strike at the victim and had only in the process, damaged a hand phone, points towards a lack of intention to injure/hurt, rather than an intention to relentlessly pursue and hurt the victim.

## DECISION

56     In brief, I note the following:

> a.     The accused had no reason to hurt the victim.

> b.     After being scolded, pointed at or angered, the accused was just bent on pushing the victim out of the stall.

> c.     After being hit during the pushing or scuffle, the accused chose to scoop water from a tank containing water that is the least hot in the stall.

> d.     The nature of the weapon chosen and the manner or force wielded do not clearly evince an intention to injure:

>> i.       If the accused had wanted to hurt the victim after being hit, the quickest, surest, most direct or forceful way would have been to hit the victim with the ladle. She, however, did not do this.

>> ii.       If the accused had been determined to use hot water to hurt/scald the victim, then water from the hottest containers/tanks ought to have been used to splash the victim. Water from the “least hot” tank at a time when

>>> 1.       she was not serving customers;

>>> 2.       she may or may not have turned off the stove (as was her usual practice); and

>>> 3.       cold water is running slowly into the tank creates doubt,

>> as to whether she had an intention to hurt instead of a mere intention to chase or force the victim out of the stall; and

>> iii.       The second and third splashes were thrown in the general direction of the victim. The third splash in particular lands on the floor. These do not appear to be splashes of a person intent of injuring another.

> e.     The accused exhibited a genuine belief that the water is “_half warm cold_” and would not cause any burns by putting her own finger/fingers into the said water later that day.

> f.     Events immediately after the incident do not suggest the accused had an intention to cause hurt.

57     Flowing from the points highlighted above, in inquiring into the accused’s subjective state of mind by inferring from her objective conduct and all the surrounding circumstances, I am of the view that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused actually intended to cause hurt or knew that hurt would result from her splashing of water.

58     I find that the accused did not possess the requisite _mens rea_ for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt by means of a heated substance and I acquitted the accused accordingly. In the light of my views on the accused’s _mens rea_, it is unnecessary for me to express an opinion on the defences of private defence and provocation.

59     Being dissatisfied with my decision, the Prosecution has raised an appeal.
