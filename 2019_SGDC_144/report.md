Contract – Contractual terms – Interpretation

19 July 2019

### District Judge James Leong Kiu Yiu:

## Introduction

1       The present suit centres around an alleged oral contract purportedly entered into in or around early May 2009 at the premises of Al-Mawaddah Mosque (“AMM”), between the representatives of the Plaintiff and the representatives of AMM. The Plaintiff’s case is that a binding contract containing various terms had been entered into at that meeting. The Defendant wholly denies the existence of the meeting and/or any contract.

## Background to the dispute

2       The Plaintiff JG 1Stop Services is a partnership incorporated in Singapore. It carries on business as an event organiser, providing decoration, catering, entertainment, make-up and transport services for events including but not limited to weddings. The Plaintiff is owned by two partners: Mr Mohamed Gani Bin Nordin (“Gani”), and his son, Mr Muhammad Razin bin Mohamed Gani (“Razin”) who did not give evidence at trial.[^1] Gani’s daughter, Ms Kartini Binte Mohamed Gani (“Kartini”), is employed as the external events manager of the Plaintiff. The Defendant Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura is being sued in its capacity as a statutory board administering all mosques in Singapore under the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap 3, Rev Ed 2009).

3       AMM obtained its Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) on 30 March 2009. The official consecration ceremony was held on 15 May 2009. AMM allowed wedding couples to hold their weddings in the mosque upon payment of a rental fee. In some cases, the couples elected for wedding services which were in addition to what was covered by the rental fee paid to the mosque.

4       The Plaintiff provided such additional wedding services for various weddings held at AMM from 2010 to 2015. The Plaintiff also set up a wedding dais there. The Plaintiff’s case is that the dais was set up before 15 May 2009[^2] while the Defendant alleges that it was only set up sometime in or around August 2009.[^3]

5       At the heart of the dispute is the nature of the relationship between the Plaintiff and AMM surrounding the Plaintiff’s provision of wedding services and setting up of the dais. The Plaintiff claims that it had entered into a valid and enforceable oral contract with representatives of AMM on or around early May 2009. Under this alleged oral contract, the Plaintiff agreed to set up, install and maintain a permanent wedding dais in the function hall of AMM. In exchange, AMM would, _inter alia_, exclusively refer all requests for wedding services to the Plaintiff. The Defendant, on the other hand, claims that the wedding dais had been installed as a gift to AMM, and there never was a meeting in or around early May 2009 where terms of the alleged oral contract were discussed and agreed upon.

6       What is undisputed was that the Plaintiff did provide wedding services to customers who held their weddings at AMM. As it was not in every case that the wedding couple would require additional wedding services, the Plaintiff would typically be notified by a representative of AMM when its services were required. Upon notification, the Plaintiff would do the necessary set-up at AMM ahead of the wedding. The Plaintiff would be paid by couples who engaged its wedding services, either by way of direct payment to the Plaintiff, or indirectly from the couples to AMM and then to the Plaintiff.

7       The first of such wedding services was provided by the Plaintiff in July 2010, and the last was on 5 December 2015. From July 2010 to December 2014, the Plaintiff provided its wedding services at AMM on multiple occasions without much issue. However, the relationship between parties deteriorated over the course of 2015 as the Plaintiff noticed that there had been a stark decline in orders for its wedding services at AMM. In particular, from April 2015 onwards, the Plaintiff’s services were no longer engaged for wedding set-ups save for one event on 5 December 2015. It also came to the Plaintiff’s attention that a third party event organiser named Ash Karsani Events Management (“Ash Karsani”) had been engaged by AMM in or about August 2015 to provide the same wedding services which the Plaintiff had been providing. In addition, the Plaintiff claims that its property, which had been left at AMM for the wedding services, had been damaged. The Defendant however denies liability for any such damaged items as alleged. The Defendant’s position is that, given the nature of the Plaintiff’s business, it was not unlikely for the Plaintiff’s items to be damaged (if any damage was done at all) by wedding guests. The Defendant further submits that the Plaintiff’s items were subject to fair wear and tear.[^4]

8       On 9 and 17 November 2015, representatives of the Plaintiff (including Gani and Kartini) met with representatives of AMM. These meetings were audio-recorded by Kartini without informing the representatives of AMM. At the meetings, the Plaintiff voiced its dissatisfaction with AMM and sought compensation from AMM. Towards the end of the second meeting on 17 November 2015, the parties decided to part ways subject to a final engagement on 5 December 2015 as the Plaintiff’s services had already been engaged for that wedding. It was also mutually agreed that the Plaintiff would remove its items from AMM after the said wedding. On 5 December 2015, the Plaintiff removed all items and decorations from AMM, including the dais, the carpet, railings and cloths.

## The parties’ cases

9       The Plaintiff commenced action on 30 May 2016 to claim against the Defendant for damages arising from a breach of the alleged oral contract entered into in or around early May 2009. The Plaintiff avers that, in or around early May 2009, Gani and Kartini had met with representatives of AMM in AMM’s office (“May 2009 Meeting”).[^5] At this said meeting, the representatives of AMM allegedly agreed with the Plaintiff by way of an oral contract to engage the Plaintiff’s services (the “Oral Contract”). The 12 salient conditions (“Salient Conditions”) of the Oral Contract were allegedly as follows:

> (a)     Customers who wanted to hold their wedding function at AMM could contact AMM directly and make reservation for the function hall on a particular date;

> (b)     Any additional wedding services provided by the Plaintiff to customers would be paid by the customers to the Plaintiff directly;

> (c)     The Plaintiff would provide venue design, set-up, decoration and related services for wedding functions and other events to be held at AMM;

> (d)     The related services for wedding functions would refer to any wedding related services such as catering, flower arrangements and any other services which the clients of AMM would require for wedding functions or other events to be held at the function hall;

> (e)     For the avoidance of doubt, other events as mentioned at (d) above refer to any event other than wedding functions which required the use of the Plaintiff’s property, including but not limited to Family Day celebrations and grassroots events, Hari Raya Aidilfitri events, Hari Raya Aidiladha events, Award Nights, Baby Shower (Cukur Rambut) events, VIP visits, Prophet’s Birthday (Maulidur Rasul) events, Wedding Fairs and school visits;

> (f)     The Plaintiff was to set up, install and maintain a permanent wedding dais (_pelamin_) in the function hall of AMM, to be used for wedding functions and other events to be held there;

> (g)     AMM would refer and assign all venue design, set-up, decoration and related works for wedding functions and other events to be held at AMM exclusively to the Plaintiff, in consideration of the Plaintiff setting up the permanent wedding dais at AMM and agreeing to update the same on a regular basis;

> (h)     The Plaintiff was to be paid by AMM or their client directly for all work done and services rendered upon the Plaintiff tendering the relevant bills to the AMM Management Board (“AMMMB”) or AMM’s client;

> (i)     No one except the Plaintiff, its employees and/or its authorised representatives would be permitted to physically handle the wedding dais and other loose items and materials belonging to the Plaintiff (“Plaintiff’s property”) that were supplied by and placed at AMM at its request. AMM was to ensure that its own employees, do not by themselves or through other persons, move, alter, use or otherwise meddle with the Plaintiff’s property at all times without the Plaintiff’s prior approval;

> (j)     The Plaintiff would receive monthly updates for upcoming events to be held in AMM, so that they could prepare for the same in a timely way;

> (k)     The Plaintiff was to regularly maintain the wedding dais including the changing of backdrop, drapes and props at least once every three (3) months; and

> (l)     All advertisements or promotions pertaining to each wedding held at AMM must be consented to by the Plaintiff before such advertisements or promotion could be published to the AMM website or social media platforms including but not limited to Facebook.[^6]

10     In addition, the Plaintiff also avers that it was orally agreed to by all parties at the alleged May 2009 Meeting that termination of the Oral Contract shall be by 30 days’ written notice to the other party.[^7]

11     With regard to payment terms, the Plaintiff’s case is that on or about a week prior to the consecration ceremony of AMM on 15 May 2009, Gani and Kartini had attended a meeting at AMM with one Mr Yusoff bin Ismail (“Yusoff”), a representative of the mosque, to get the measurements of the event hall for the installation of the wedding dais. At that same meeting with Yusoff, the payment terms for the alleged Oral Contact were agreed by the Plaintiff and Yusoff as follows:

> (a)     AMM would provide the basic infrastructure such as tables, chairs and the in-house AV system and bill the client accordingly (the “infrastructure”); and

> (b)     Any additional requests by the clients to add further decorations or skirtings to the dais or the infrastructure and/or to customise any decorations would be directed to the Plaintiff, who would charge them a flat rate of $1,500 per request.[^8]

12     Initially, the employees of AMM with whom the Plaintiff (through Kartini) had liaised primarily with were Ms Rosmania bte Mohd Harris (“Rosmania”) and Ms Salamah Maharobin (“Salamah”). However, they subsequently resigned, and Kartini then liaised primarily with another employee, Ms Syahedah binte Samsudin (“Syahedah”), from on or about 2014.[^9]

13     The Plaintiff avers that in or around December 2014, Syahedah had represented to Kartini that the AMMMB and AMM wanted to vary the payment terms of the Oral Contract, such that AMM would pay the Plaintiff a flat rate of $2,000 per month regardless of the number of events held at AMM. These payment terms were only for the rental of the dais and table skirting, and any additional changes to the decoration of the dais and table skirtings would be chargeable accordingly. The Plaintiff’s case is that it had agreed to these payment terms by way of a further oral agreement starting from 2015 (“Subsequent Agreement”). The Salient Conditions remained the same under the Subsequent Agreement.[^10]

14     In or about late February 2015, Syahedah, on behalf of AMMMB and Yusoff, informed Kartini that the AMMMB did not want to pay the flat fee of $2,000 as per the Subsequent Agreement, and preferred an itemised charging scheme instead. In or around March 2015, Syahedah orally made a request to Kartini for the Subsequent Agreement to be amended to reflect the itemised charging scheme (“March 15 Agreement”). The Plaintiff avers that it agreed to the itemised charging scheme only on the condition that the Salient Conditions continue to remain unchanged and binding.[^11]

15     The Plaintiff states that payments had been made pursuant to the Subsequent Agreement and March 15 Agreement.[^12] However, from April 2015, the Plaintiff did not receive any orders from AMM concerning the provision of wedding services. Kartini had enquired with Syahedah, but was told that there were no weddings held then or in the near future. The Plaintiff avers that it had requested to meet the AMMMB (through Syahedah) to discuss the issue of a stark decline in orders but the meeting never materialised. In August 2015, Syahedah asked Kartini to change the decoration on the dais. However, as the Plaintiff wanted to meet with the AMMMB to clarify matters first, they declined Syahedah’s request.[^13] It was also around this time that the Plaintiff discovered damage to its property when Kartini and Gani went to AMM.[^14]

16     Subsequently, the Plaintiff discovered that AMM had engaged Ash Karsani in or about August 2015 for the wedding services that the Plaintiff used to provide. The Plaintiff also found out that Ash Karsani had used the Plaintiff’s property for several wedding functions held at AMM from 13 August 2015 to 3 December 2015.[^15] This culminated in the audio-recorded meetings with Mr Sharifuddin bin Mohamed Ali (“Sharifuddin”), the Chairman of AMMMB, on 9 and 17 November 2015 (see paragraph 8 above). The Plaintiff then brought the current action to claim for general and special damages arising from the breach of the Salient Conditions of the Oral Contract. In this regard, counsel for the Plaintiff had clarified during trial that the Plaintiff’s claim is for a breach of the Oral Contract and not the Subsequent Agreement and/or March 15 Agreement, which form a “backdrop to the story”.[^16]

17     The Plaintiff called five witnesses to give evidence at the trial of this matter:

> (a)     PW 1: Gani, one of two partners of the Plaintiff;

> (b)     PW 2: Kartini, external events manager of the Plaintiff;

> (c)     PW 3: Ms Nor Liyana bte Noor Mohammad, who had engaged the Plaintiff’s wedding décor services for her wedding at AMM on 5 January 2014;

> (d)     PW 4: Rosmania, an employee of the mosque who liaised with Kartini with regard to the Plaintiff’s provision of wedding services at AMM; and

> (e)     PW 5: Ms Zakiah bte Abu Mansoor (“Zakiah”), who engaged the services of the Plaintiff for her wedding at AMM on 14 December 2013.

18     It is the Defendant’s position that there was no such meeting in early May 2009 between the representatives of AMM and the Plaintiff confirming the Plaintiff’s provision of wedding services.[^17] According to the Defendant, no meeting could have taken place in AMM prior to the Mosque Building Committee (“MBC”) receiving the keys (including the keys to the offices and conference room of the mosque) around one week before the consecration ceremony on 15 May 2009.[^18]

19     With regard to the dais that was set up in the function room of AMM, the Defendant denies that it was placed by the Plaintiff as valuable consideration for AMM exclusively referring wedding services to the Plaintiff. The Defendant’s position is that the dais was a gift. In particular, Yusoff’s evidence was that in or about August 2009, he first noticed the dais in AMM. Yusoff said that he had asked Rosmania who put in the dais, and Rosmania had informed Yusoff that the Plaintiff had installed it as a gift.[^19]

20     The Defendant also denies that Yusoff had met with Gani and Kartini on or about a week prior to the consecration ceremony of AMM. The Defendant’s case is that Yusoff met Kartini (without Gani) for the first time sometime in or about July 2010, when Kartini was setting up the dais for a wedding. This was the first wedding set-up conducted by the Plaintiff at AMM.[^20]

21     At this alleged meeting in July 2010, Yusoff had informed Kartini that an informal arrangement could be worked out between the Plaintiff and AMM in reciprocation of the Plaintiff’s gift of a dais. Under this informal arrangement, AMM would give the Plaintiff’s contact to customers for wedding related services if the customers so enquired. Customers would then pay the Plaintiff for any services rendered by the Plaintiff directly. The Defendant’s position is that there was never any mention that the Plaintiff was to enjoy exclusivity over all wedding events or wedding related services in AMM, and couples could proceed with another vendor if they so wished. There was also no mention that the dais could only be used exclusively for weddings where the Plaintiff provided wedding related services.[^21]

22     With regard to the change in arrangement in December 2014, the Defendant’s case is that Kartini was the one who had approached Syahedah and Yusoff with a proposal for the Plaintiff to be paid a monthly lump sum of $2,000 for the setting up of all wedding events. This was only for the setting up, and not for the full wedding decorations, for which the Plaintiff would charge the client separately.[^22] This proposal was brought to the AMMMB during a board meeting on 16 January 2015, where the proposal was rejected by the board. The board proposed an itemised billing structure instead and Syahedah was tasked to gather quotations. Syahedah was also tasked to inform the Plaintiff of the rejection.[^23]

23     In the meantime, the Plaintiff had completed the wedding set-up works for January 2015 notwithstanding the AMMMB’s rejection of the $2,000 lump sum proposal. As the AMMMB was not agreeable to pay for the same, Syahedah and Yusoff obtained a third party sponsor to pay $2,000 to the Plaintiff out of goodwill. This was paid in or about February 2015.[^24]

24     Thereafter, at a subsequent AMMMB meeting on 20 March 2015, Syahedah presented three quotations for the itemised billing structure. However, the AMMMB found them unattractive and decided that AMM’s Corporate Services team, headed by Syahedah, would take over conduct of all wedding set-up unless the customer requested for more elaborate wedding décor that could not be done in-house.[^25] Nonetheless, the Defendant avers that prior to the AMMMB meeting on 20 March 2015, the Plaintiff’s services had been engaged on an ad-hoc basis based on their itemised pricing for two weddings in March 2015.[^26]

25     With regard to Syahedah’s request for the Plaintiff to change the dais cloth for the wedding in August 2015, the Defendant’s case is that AMM was constrained to engage the services of Ash Karsani as the Plaintiff did not do so. Subsequently, AMM continued to engage Ash Karsani as the Plaintiff did not indicate that it was willing to continue providing wedding decoration services.[^27]

26     After the meetings on 9 and 17 November 2015, Syahedah (on behalf of the AMMMB) had, on 2 December 2015, sent an email to the Plaintiff proposing a goodwill payment of $3,000. The Defendant avers that this was explicitly stated to be a goodwill payment and not to be construed as any admission of liability on the part of the mosque. This offer was however not accepted by the Plaintiff.

27     Finally, the relationship between parties came to an end after the Plaintiff removed all its items and decorations on 5 December 2015. The Defendant’s position is that it had allowed the Plaintiff to remove the dais, carpet, railings and cloth, which belonged to AMM, as a gesture of goodwill and to avoid further conflict.[^28]

28     The Defendant called nine witnesses to give evidence at the trial of this matter:

> (a)     DW 1: Mr Mohamed Azam bin Abdul Aziz, a Senior Director of Finance & Asset Development in the employ of the Defendant;

> (b)     DW 2: Mr Zulkifli bin Baba (“Zulkifli”), a member of the MBC from the outset sometime in 2004. He was also the Treasurer on the AMMMB from 19 August 2009 to 18 August 2011;

> (c)     DW 3: Mr Shukor bin Amin (“Shukor”), a member of the MBC from the outset sometime in 2004. He was also the Secretary on the AMMMB from 19 August 2009 to 18 August 2011;

> (d)     DW 4: Mr Saifulbahri bin Rasno (“Saifulbahri”), Chairman of the MBC and Vice-Chairman of the AMMMB from 19 August 2009 to present;

> (e)     DW 5: Yusoff, Secretary of the MBC. He also held different appointments in the AMMMB at various times – Assistant Treasurer (19 August 2009 to 18 August 2011), Secretary (19 August 2011 to 30 October 2013), Treasurer (1 November 2013 to 31 October 2016), and Secretary (1 November 2016 to present);

> (f)     DW 6: Sharifuddin, who was initially the Secretary of AMMMB from 1 November 2013 to 31 July 2015, but is currently the Chairman of AMMMB starting from 1 August 2015;

> (g)     DW 7: Syahedah, a Corporate Service Officer in the employ of AMM from 2 May 2012;

> (h)     DW 8: Ms Fazilah binte Abdul Rahman, a Corporate Service Officer in the employ of AMM from 13 November 2013; and

> (i)     DW 9: Mr Muhammad Asyraf bin Karsani, the sole proprietor of Ash Karsani.

29     It is useful to clarify at this point the difference between the MBC and the AMMMB. The Defendant’s witnesses have given evidence that while the MBC had been formed sometime in 2004, the AMMMB was only formally constituted on 19 August 2009.[^29] Nonetheless, and as can be observed from paragraph 28 above, several members of the AMMMB were also members of the MBC (_ie_, Zulkifli, Shukor, Saifulbahri and Yusoff). Saifulbahri explained during cross-examination that that some members of the MBC were retained and appointed to the AMMMB on 19 August 2009, while others left.[^30] The Plaintiff’s position is that at the alleged May 2009 Meeting, the representatives of AMM had represented to Gani and Kartini that they acted collectively on behalf of AMMMB.[^31] When Defendant’s counsel pointed out during cross-examination that the AMMMB had not been formed at the time of the alleged May 2009 Meeting, both Gani and Kartini said that they were not aware of this.[^32]

## Issues to be determined

30     There are four main issues to be determined by the court in this suit:

> (a)     Whether a valid and enforceable Oral Contract was entered into at the alleged May 2009 Meeting between the Plaintiff and the representatives of AMM for the Plaintiff’s wedding services.

> (b)     If there was an Oral Contract, whether there was a term and/or condition of the Oral Contract that provided for the exclusive referral of services by AMM to the Plaintiff and the exclusive use of the Plaintiff’s property in AMM by the Plaintiff.

> (c)     Whether the actions of AMM in engaging third parties other than the Plaintiff to provide wedding services has resulted in a breach of the Oral Contract.

> (d)     If there was an Oral Contract, whether the Plaintiff is entitled to claim the following damages arising from a breach of the Oral Contract, namely:

>> (i)       the special damages arising from the damaged items, which _inter alia_ include the wedding dais, carpet, lightings, wedding decorations, and wedding accessories; and

>> (ii)       the general damages arising from the Plaintiff’s loss of business from April 2015 to December 2015.

31     The trial of the matter took place over seven days, with the last witness (DW 9) heard on 28 January 2019. At the close of trial, parties agreed to the sequential exchange of closing submissions.[^33] Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions were filed on 11 March 2019, the Defendant’s Closing Submissions were filed on 1 April 2019, and the Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions were filed one day late[^34] on 16 April 2019. Parties addressed the issues set out at paragraph 30 above in their respective written closing submissions, which I considered thoroughly in arriving at my decision below.

### Issue 1: Was a valid and enforceable Oral Contract entered into at the alleged May 2009 Meeting?

32     The Defendant submits that this first issue should further be split into two sub-issues as follows:

> (a)     whether there was a meeting held in or around early May 2009 between the Plaintiff and the representatives of AMM at which an Oral Contract for the Plaintiff’s wedding services was entered into; and

> (b)     if there was such a meeting, whether a valid and enforceable Oral Contract was entered into at the meeting.[^35]

33     The Defendant further submits that the first sub-issue is essentially a finding of fact[^36], and the second sub-issue encapsulates the legal principles on determining the existence of an oral agreement.[^37]

34     To my mind, as the evidence to be considered for both sub-issues will largely overlap, it is preferable to consider the evidence in a holistic manner to answer the issue of whether a valid and enforceable Oral Contract was entered into between parties. In this regard, evidence pointing towards the existence or otherwise of the alleged May 2009 Meeting will certainly be a relevant factor in my finding of whether there is an Oral Contract.

35     The High Court in _ARS v ART and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 78</span> (“_ARS_”) reviewed various Court of Appeal decisions and distilled the following guiding principles on the proper approach for determining the existence of an oral agreement (at \[53\] of _ARS_):

> (a)     in ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement, the court will consider the relevant documentary evidence (such as written correspondence) and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time;

> (b)     where possible, the court should look first at the relevant documentary evidence;

> (c)     the availability of relevant documentary evidence reduces the need to rely solely on the credibility of witnesses in order to ascertain if an oral agreement exists;

> (d)     oral testimony may be less reliable as it is based on the witness’ recollection and it may be affected by subsequent events (such as the dispute between the parties);

> (e)     credible oral testimony may clarify the existing documentary evidence;

> (f)     where the witness is not legally trained, the court should not place undue emphasis on the choice of words; and

> (g)     if there is little or no documentary evidence, the court will nevertheless examine the precise factual matrix to ascertain if there is an oral agreement concluded between the parties.

36     The High Court further observed in _ARS_ (at \[54\]) that in that case, some 12 or more years had passed since the disputed events took place, and oral testimony might become even less reliable. The same observations may be made in this present dispute, as it has been nearly 10 years since the disputed May 2009 Meeting.

37     Having laid out the position at law, I will now proceed to consider the evidence in turn.

#### (A)   Documentary evidence

38     It is not in contention that the alleged Oral Contract was neither reduced in writing, nor was there any written record of the discussion that took place at the purported May 2009 Meeting where the Oral Contract was allegedly entered into. The following documentary evidence were raised by parties: (a) the Minutes of Meeting of the AMMMB in 2009; (b) the draft proposal sent by the Plaintiff on 30 April 2009; (c) photographs of the Plaintiff’s dais taken between 15 and 17 May 2009 during the official consecration ceremony of AMM; (d) photographs taken on 21 April 2009 depicting members of the MBC touring AMM, and (e) the TOP issued on 30 March 2009.

39     Of these, the Minutes of Meeting of the AMMMB are the only set of documentary evidence that could point directly to the existence of any alleged May 2009 Meeting, the parties who had attended any such meeting, and the matters which were discussed at any such meeting. During the course of the trial, the Defendant’s counsel produced the Minutes of Meeting of the AMMMB from January to June 2009 for the Plaintiff’s counsel to inspect. The Plaintiff’s counsel then confirmed that there was no reference therein to any dealings with the Plaintiff or contract with the Plaintiff.[^38]

40     The Defendant submits that the Minutes of Meeting corroborates its position that there was neither a May 2009 Meeting with the Plaintiff nor any contract entered into with the Plaintiff in 2009, which Minutes the Plaintiff’s counsel does not dispute.[^39]

41     In response, the Plaintiff’s position is that it had a very short period of time to comb through the volumes of Minutes of Meeting, which were from January to June 2009, as the minutes were only produced on the last day of trial. Further, the Plaintiff submits that it is more plausible that the AMMMB simply chose not to make any references within the Minutes of Meeting about any mention of any contract entered into or dealings with the Plaintiff.[^40]

42     If counsel for the Plaintiff required more time to review the Minutes of Meeting, he could and should have asked for time during the trial. In my view, there is no basis to suggest that the AMMMB would chose not to make any reference to any contract or dealings with the Plaintiff in the Minutes of Meeting. This is particularly since relations between the Plaintiff and the representatives of AMM were positive at that time. Having said that, I am mindful that the maker of the minutes was not called to testify and I make no finding on the accuracy or otherwise of the minutes. It suffices for our purposes to note that the minutes do not show that (a) the May 2009 Meeting took place, and/or (b) the Oral Contract was entered into.

43     With regard to the draft proposal sent on 30 April 2009[^41], this was sent by Kartini on behalf of the Plaintiff to Rosmania and Salamah. It is the Plaintiff’s case that the terms contained within this draft proposal were the Plaintiff’s offer to the AMMMB to provide exclusive wedding decoration services in AMM. The Plaintiff avers that details of this draft proposal were discussed at the alleged May 2009 Meeting, and parties entered into the Oral Contract which contained the Salient Conditions.[^42] The cover email states (originally in Malay, translated to English):

> Dear Kak Ros and Kak Salamah,

> First of all, my family and I extend our thanks for giving us this opportunity to work together with the Mosque. Here I am attaching a draft of our proposal, sample pamphlets and the comprehensive package for the newlyweds as requested for you \[sic\] reference for our meeting later. Thank you once again; representing us for the meeting later.

> …

> So, do reply to me with the outcome once it is finalised at the meeting.

44     The draft proposal attached to this cover email of 30 April 2009 is a four-page document titled “JG Wedding Creations Terms of Service Proposal Letter”. It contains 10 clauses, describing the services to be provided, the duration of agreement, the terms and conditions, the management of property, the fees, the termination clause, _etc_.

45     The Defendant’s case is that the draft proposal does not show that the Oral Contract had been entered into because (a) four of the Defendant’s witnesses had said during cross-examination that they have not seen or do not recall seeing the email or the draft proposal before, and (b) the terms of the draft proposal are wholly inconsistent with the alleged terms of the Oral Contract.[^43]

46     I agree with the Defendant that the draft proposal does not show that (a) the May 2009 Meeting took place, and/or (b) the Oral Contract was entered into.

47     First, there is no reference in the draft proposal to any meeting that was to be held between the Plaintiff and representatives of the mosque. In fact, in the cover email, Kartini thanked Rosmania and Salamah for “representing \[the Plaintiff\] for the meeting later”. It is not clear from the evidence what meeting Kartini was referring to here, though it was unlikely to have been a meeting which involved the Plaintiff.

48     Second, the Plaintiff alleges that the draft proposal is _in pari materia_ to the conditions that were agreed at the purported May 2009 Meeting. However, I find that there were significant differences between the terms in the draft proposal and the Oral Contract as alleged by the Plaintiff. In particular:

> (a)     With regard to advertising, Clauses 4(1) to 4(4) provided various active ways through which the Plaintiff’s services would be promoted, _eg_, to be “highlighted in meeting announcements and promotional materials”, in “delegation package and introduction”, in “banners or pamphlets” and at the mosque’s “solemnization hall”. However, these terms were not a part of the alleged Salient Conditions, which instead required the Plaintiff’s consent before any advertisement or promotion could be published onto AMM’s “website or social media platforms”.

> (b)     Clause 4(5) of the draft proposal referred to the Plaintiff as the “priority company” in providing venue decoration for any events held in AMM, unless “otherwise upon mutual agreement” by both parties. In contrast, the alleged Salient Conditions provided that AMM would “refer and assign all venue design … exclusively” to the Plaintiff. There was no provision for an exception in the Salient Conditions.

> (c)     While Clause 4(6) of the draft proposal stated that the Plaintiff will “only replaced (sic) the existence (sic) showcase with new materials and necessary accessories quarterly”, the Salient Conditions provided that the Plaintiff was to “regularly maintain the wedding dais including the changing of backdrop, drapes and props at least once every three (3) months”. In other words, the dais could, under the Salient Conditions, be replaced more frequently.

> (d)     The requirement of a written notice two weeks in advance in Clause 4(7) of the draft proposal did not appear in the Salient Conditions. Instead, the Salient Conditions provided that the “Plaintiff would receive monthly updates for upcoming events to be held in \[AMM\]”.

> (e)     While Clause 5(3) of the draft proposal prohibited “any loan or rental of showcase items”, the Salient Conditions provided that “\[n\]o one except the Plaintiff, its employees and/or its authorised representatives would be permitted to physically handle the … Plaintiff’s property”.

> (f)     Clause 2 of the draft proposal provided that the duration of the proposal “shall be for three months during trial period, commencing on 16 May 2009 and terminating on 16 August 2009, unless sooner terminated by mutual parties.” Further, the terms of the proposal “shall be extended to one year inclusive the trial period upon mutual agreement of both parties.” Such a term was not present in the alleged Salient Conditions or Oral Contract.

> (g)     While the Oral Contract allegedly provided that termination of the same shall be by 30 days’ written notice to the other party, such a term was not present in Clause 7 (termination) of the draft proposal.

> (h)     Various boilerplate clauses in the draft proposal were also not present in the Salient Conditions or Oral Contract.

49     The Plaintiff’s case is that parties had discussed the details of the draft proposal at the alleged May 2009 Meeting.[^44] According to Kartini, the May 2009 Meeting took “\[a\]bout half an hour”.[^45] The Plaintiff claims that the meeting only took approximately 30 minutes as the MBC already had sight of the draft proposal.[^46] Even if this were so, it is difficult to accept that the multiple terms at paragraph 48 above could have been meaningfully negotiated and varied within a relatively short duration of 30 minutes.

50     Third, the Plaintiff avers that the MBC had agreed to the draft proposal, as corroborated by Rosmania.[^47] However, I find that Rosmania’s evidence at trial did not corroborate the Plaintiff’s position. Neither did her evidence incontrovertibly point towards the existence of a meeting in early May 2009 at which the draft proposal sent to her and Salamah on 30 April 2009 was discussed. Rosmania was called by the Plaintiff as a witness and gave her evidence by way of oral evidence-in-chief as opposed to filing an Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief ahead of the trial. Salamah was not a witness in the proceedings. During her oral examination-in-chief, Rosmania testified as follows regarding the draft proposal:[^48]

> QMadam, this e-mail was sent to you, correct?

> AI---I don’t know. I can’t remember.

> QNo, look at the e-mail. It has---it’s addressed to ‘rose@ennaeemmosque.com.sg’. And ‘Rose’ is you?

> AYes \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

> QSo, can I say that this e-mail was sent to you?

> AProbably, yes. But I can’t remember.

> QMadam---Madam, this e-mail was sent with some attachments. One of the attachments is at page 162.

> A1-6?

> Q162\. This was a proposal from Kartini to yourself and Salamah. It says, “Terms of service proposal letter.” Does this document look familiar to you?

> ALike---like have. These are the conditions.

> QBut you are saying these are the conditions?

> AYes.

> QAnd the conditions was what was agreed at the board meeting, correct?

> AFor example, for the cars, we did not take it. So far, we took from what I know. If people were to make their solemnisation there, and---and they take pictures at the dais, that’s ours. For food, if they use other catering, it’s fine.

> …

> QBut you said this was a board meeting. So, was this document before the board?

> AEveryone seen, every meeting Salamah will give documents like these. Profits from the rental of Kartini’s---from the ser---from Kartini’s services.

> QOkay. But let’s just talk about this meeting that you referred to earlier. You said---you said there was Mr. Saifulbahri, Mr. Yusoff, yourself, ‘Haji Jafar’ Mr Shukor, and Mr Zul.

> AZul?

> QSo, were they all aware of this---this document at page 162?

> AI have no idea. \[As spoken by Witness in English\].

> QWas this document produced during this board meeting?

> AI cannot remember. \[As spoken by Witness in English\].

51     Reading the above passage in its entirety, it is clear that while Rosmania may have personally seen the draft proposal before, she could not recall it being placed before the board at a board meeting and she had no idea if the board was aware of the draft proposal. Rosmania’s evidence in this regard is in fact consistent with four of the Defendant’s witnesses (namely Zulkifli, Shukor, Saifulbahri and Yusoff) that they had not seen or did not recall seeing the email of 30 April 2009 or the draft proposal before.[^49]

52     In the premises, I am unable to agree with the Plaintiff that the draft proposal sent on 30 April 2009 is clear contemporaneous objective documentary evidence that there was in existence an oral contract.[^50] On the contrary, I find that the draft proposal does not show that (a) the May 2009 Meeting took place, and/or (b) that the Oral Contract was entered into.

53     With regard to the photographs of the Plaintiff’s dais taken between 15 and 17 May 2009 during the official consecration ceremony of AMM, I am of the opinion that the presence of the dais in AMM is not by itself incontrovertible evidence of the May 2009 Meeting or the Oral Contract. The Plaintiff is alleging that the dais was placed in AMM further to the Oral Contract. However, the presence of the dais itself does not therefore mean that what the Plaintiff is alleging must necessarily be correct.

54     With regard to the photographs taken on 21 April 2009 depicting members of the MBC touring AMM, and the TOP issued on 30 March 2009, I find that they are inconclusive as to the issue of whether the May 2009 Meeting took place and whether the Oral Contract was entered into. The fact that the representatives could have entered AMM prior to May 2009 before the official opening does not in any way show that the May 2009 Meeting had happened or that the Oral Contract has been entered into.

#### (B)   Oral evidence

55     The oral evidence testifying to the existence (or not) of the May 2009 Meeting were mainly led by Gani, Kartini, and Rosmania for the Plaintiff, and Zulkifli, Shukor, Saifulbahri and Yusoff for the Defendant at the trial of this matter.

##### (i)   Assessment of Gani’s and Kartini’s evidence

56     At trial, Gani and Kartini testified that they were both present at the May 2009 Meeting during which the Oral Contract was made. They gave evidence that the meeting took place at AMM with the following representatives from AMM: Saifulbahri, Salamah, Rosmania, Shukor and Zulkifli.[^51] In general, I found both Gani’s and Kartini’s oral evidence to be unreliable as they tended to be inconsistent and riddled with memory gaps.

57     First, Gani’s and Kartini’s evidence at trial as regards when the dais was installed in AMM were inconsistent with the Plaintiff’s position prior to trial. The Plaintiff’s pleadings made no reference to the time at which the dais was installed. It was then listed as an agreed fact that the Plaintiff’s dais was set up “sometime in late 2009”.[^52] The amended Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief of Gani and Kartini both filed on 6 December 2018 also made no mention to when the dais was set up, except that “\[o\]n or about a week prior to the Opening Ceremony of the mosque on 15 May 2009, \[Gani and Kartini\] attended a meeting at \[AMM\] with Yusoff to get the measurements of the event hall for the installation of the wedding dais.”[^53] The reference in their affidavits was only to obtain measurements, and not to set up the dais.

58     At trial, Gani testified that there was no meeting to obtain measurements. Instead, he had set up the dais one week before the opening ceremony:[^54]

> QNow you said that there was another meeting when you went there to take measurements, a few days later. At that meeting, who did you see?

> ARosmainah \[sic\] introduced me to Salamah.

> QOkay, and you took the measurements.

> AIt did not happen because Salamah said that the carpet has yet to be fitted in so---so, the measurements---the taking of measurements did not take place.

> QAnd you had 1 more meeting at the mosque, where you were introduced to Mr. Yusoff in May.

> AWhen I was fixing the pelamin on the dais, which was 1 week---when I was fixing the pelamin on the dais, which was 1 week before the opening ceremony, Rosmainah \[sic\] introduced me to Yusoff.

> QNow the---the opening ceremony was on 15th of May 2009, correct?

> ACorrect.

> QAnd by that time, are you saying you had already installed your dais?

> AYes, it was ready.

59     Similarly, Kartini also testified for the first time at trial that the dais was installed on or about 8 May 2009 (_ie_, one week before the opening ceremony), and that she knew the dais would be at the opening ceremony:[^55]

> QSo, when---when do you say you installed the dais?

> AWhen I installed the dais, it’s after the board agreement upon my---

> QWhen? When? What date?

> AA week before the opening.

> QThe opening was---when was the opening?

> A15th May.

> …

> QSo you installed the dais on about 8th of May?

> AYes, Sir.

> QHave you got any photographs to show the dais was installed on 8th May?

> ANo.

> QNo.

> ABecause I know it’s going to be in the opening.

60     The main reason why Gani and Kartini were so certain at trial that the dais had been set up prior to 15 May 2009 was because of a photograph uploaded on the Facebook page of AMM, which showed a dais in the background during AMM’s opening ceremony on 15 May 2009.[^56] Kartini referred to this as “my dais” [^57], and she was therefore “very assertive that \[her\] dais is already in place … before August, \[and the\] meeting must be in place to get the approval from the board.”[^58] It bears noting that the said photograph had been in evidence prior to trial and was exhibited to Gani’s AEIC and Kartini’s AEIC. However, notwithstanding that, the Plaintiff had never asserted before trial that the dais was installed ahead of the opening ceremony as it was “going to be in the opening” ceremony. I consider it curious that such a material fact was only introduced so belatedly at the trial.

61     Second, I accept the Defendant’s submission that Gani’s position on the alleged representatives of AMM who were present at the May 2009 Meeting was inconsistent throughout the proceedings. In particular, there were differences in the names cited in the Statement of Claim, the Further and Better Particulars, Gani’s AEIC, and finally on cross-examination.[^59] During cross-examination, both Kartini and Gani testified that the following representatives of AMM were present at the May 2009 Meeting: Saifulbahri, Salamah, Rosmania, Shukor and Zulkifli.[^60] However, it is the Plaintiff’s pleaded case that Yusoff was the one who had agreed with the Plaintiff by way of the Oral Contract to engage the Plaintiff’s services.[^61] The Plaintiff also provided further particulars of the Oral Contract, which was made at the May 2009 Meeting in the office of AMM in the presence of Yusoff, Rosmania, Salamah, Zulkifli, one Mr Syukur Amin, and Saifulbahri.[^62] When cross-examined by Defendant’s counsel, Gani agreed that it was “a mistake” that Yusoff had agreed with the Plaintiff to enter into the Oral Contract:[^63]

> Qwe are not talking of payments? We are talking of the contract? No, Witness, we are talking of the contract. You are saying here \[in the Statement of Claim\] that Yusoff agreed with you to have a contract. Is that also a mistake?

> AYes, it’s a mistake.

62     While I accept that nearly 10 years has passed since the May 2009 Meeting and the memories of witnesses may be impaired, I found it strange that Gani would have been mistaken as to the identity of the AMM representative(s) who had entered into the Oral Contract with the Plaintiff. This is especially since the Plaintiff had singled out Yusoff as the representative who had agreed with the Plaintiff, but at trial, its key witnesses have taken the position that Yusoff was not even present at the May 2009 Meeting. While it may be conceivable that details of the discussions may be forgotten, it seemed to me that there should be less uncertainty as regards something as fundamental as the key representative who had concluded any alleged contract with the Plaintiff.

63     Third, I agree with the Defendant that there were inconsistencies in Gani’s and Kartini’s evidence as regards the terms of the alleged Oral Contract, and they had not provided a satisfactory explanation for the inconsistency.[^64]

64     The Statement of Claim had initially contained eight “salient express terms of the Oral Contract”.[^65] This expanded to the 12 Salient Conditions in Gani’s AEIC and Kartini’s AEIC, with a 13th term for termination by way of a 30 days’ written notice.[^66] Out of the four additional Salient Conditions that appeared in Gani’s AEIC and Kartini’s AEIC (which were not present in the Statement of Claim), two were from the Further and Better Particulars to the Statement of Claim,[^67] and the other two were pleaded in the Reply (albeit with language mirrored from the Defence).[^68] The termination clause had not previously appeared in any other cause paper filed in the proceedings.

65     Gani and Kartini were however unable to satisfactorily explain how the eight terms pleaded in the Statement of Claim became 13 terms in their Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief. In particular, they failed to explain that the Plaintiff had earlier pleaded two terms in its Further and Better Particulars, and another two in its Reply. When asked by Defendant’s counsel to explain the discrepancy in the number of terms during cross-examination, Gani’s response was evasive and suggested a lack of understanding of the material terms of the Oral Contract:[^69]

> QNow, in your Statement of Claim, you have listed out 8 terms of oral contract. But in your Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, you have listed out 12.

> AYes, there are 12 in the affidavit. But what I remember I will say. If I see and I can read it then I will say it, but if---what I remember that is what I will say first.

> QSo, you did not remember these 12 conditions when your writ was filed, but when you filed your Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief a year later, you remembered.

> ALike I said, my child was the one who helped me remember. Kartini was the one who told me and remind me about the meetings---

> QYou---

> Aand that is what I remember.

> …

> AThe difference \[in the number of terms\] like I said is because I forget. Only after my child explained one by one, that is when I know that there are more than that.

> …

> ALike I said earlier, my child explained this and that---explained this and that, the 7 or 8 that was mentioned and we can proceed. That---like if there are then we will proceed. After we proceeded and then we checked that was when we realised there were 12 conditions.

66     Similarly, Kartini was unable to provide a cogent explanation as regards why the number of terms differed:[^70]

> QBut in your affidavit, it became 12. Can you clarify this?

> AYes, Your Honour. As you can see, the additional parts where we added on in our affidavit is 21.1. Where we have agreed orally with the boss that customer who wants to hold ---

> …

> AYes, as I go through with my lawyer, Your Honour that these are the important points that was discussed orally. And we need to incurred that because it was being a practice from… \[2009, 2015\].

> …

> AThese 7 \[conditions\] was already discussed during my board meeting in 2009 with the Mosque. And this affidavit which is true and my latest, uh, declaration that this orally discussed must be incurred in my affidavit. Because what I show to the board during 2009 is, these 7 clause which appears in my um, email to the, uh, Mosque, the proposal of, uh, on the thieth---30th April. But the oral one was discussed, not incurred. So, when I discussed with my lawyer, this has been a practice and being agreed upon. And each---each of us have to abide to the agreement. So, it need to be incurred into my affidavit. Because that was the latest, uh, uh, truth that we declare.

67     What Kartini seemed to be suggesting on cross-examination was that seven terms had been agreed to orally at the meeting, and the remaining terms were “a practice and being agreed upon.” It is not clear what Kartini was referring to here, save to note that the parties had no ongoing “practice” or relationship at the time the Oral Contract was supposedly entered into at the alleged May 2009 Meeting. What is clear is that Kartini could not convincingly explain how all 13 terms had been negotiated and agreed upon at the May 2009 Meeting.

68     In addition, as pointed out by the Defendant, Gani had introduced new terms of the alleged Oral Contract while on the witness stand, which were neither part of the eight “salient express terms” as pleaded in the Statement of Claim, nor part of the Salient Conditions of the Oral Contract in Gani’s AEIC.[^71]

69     The inconsistencies in Gani’s and Kartini’s evidence as regards the alleged terms of the Oral Contract as outlined at paragraphs 63 to 68 above show that the Plaintiff was unsure of the material terms of the contract. In _ARS_, the High Court considered that the fact that the plaintiff appeared unsure of the material terms of the agreements strongly suggested in that case that the agreements did not exist. A similar conclusion can be drawn in the present case.

70     As a general point as regards Gani’s credibility as a witness, I also note that he would on occasion refer to documents which were not in evidence, and which he would be unable to produce. For example, Gani had initially claimed during cross-examination that the Plaintiff’s contract with AMM was in writing. When asked by counsel for the Defendant to produce the alleged written agreement, Gani referred to his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief. However, counsel for the Defendant pointed out that the portion of his affidavit that Gani was referring to stated that it had been “orally agreed” between parties.[^72] It was then that Gani conceded that there was no written contract but maintained that there was an oral contract.[^73] Subsequently, when asked whether he had sent “any e-mail message or letter” confirming the terms of the Oral Contract, Gani alleged that he had.[^74] However, when asked to identify this “e-mail message or letter”, Gani referred instead to an “SMS” but was in any event unable to produce any form of written communication. Upon further questioning by Defendant’s counsel and clarification by Plaintiff’s counsel, Gani conceded that there was no such written communication sent, and that he was thinking of the draft proposal sent on 30 April 2009.[^75] These further buttressed my finding that Gani’s oral evidence was unreliable.

##### (ii)   Assessment of Rosmania’s evidence

71     Rosmania should have been a key witness in the proceedings as she was the main point of contact with Kartini while Rosmania was with AMM.[^76] However, owing to the long passage of time, exacerbated by the fact that Rosmania had given evidence by way of an oral evidence-in-chief, I found her recollection of events patchy and inconsistent, and therefore consider her an unreliable witness.

72     First, Rosmania’s evidence as regards the details of the alleged May 2009 Meeting was inconsistent and unclear. Rosmania testified that she had gotten to know Kartini through her daughter, who used the Plaintiff’s décor for her wedding. According to Rosmania, her daughter’s wedding was held in July 2009. It was only after her daughter had gotten married that she asked Kartini “whether she would like to volunteer her services when her decoration is pretty at the mosque”[^77] – this would have been after May 2009, which was when the Plaintiff is alleging the meeting with AMM representatives took place. Rosmania said that she subsequently “made a board meeting where we all agreed on the agreed terms”[^78], although she “can’t remember” when this board meeting was held.[^79] She could not even be sure “whether this meeting was in 2009 or the year after”.[^80] She then agreed that a meeting never took place in May 2009.[^81]

73     Rosmania was also unable to recall the attendees of the meeting with the AMM representatives. She said that she has “never met \[Gani\]” and she has “never had any dealings” or communicated with Gani.[^82] When asked whether Kartini’s father was present at the meeting, she said that she could not remember.[^83] She initially said that she was present with Saifulbahri, Shukor, Zulkifli, Yusoff and one “Mr Jafar”.[^84] However, when asked again at a later time, she said that she could not remember who attended the meeting, but she remembered that it was “the Exco”.[^85]

74     Not only was Rosmania’s evidence internally inconsistent, it also did not support the Plaintiff’s position that there had been a meeting in or around early May 2009 with Kartini, Gani, Rosmania, Saifulbahri, Salamah, Shukor and Zulkifli.

75     Second, Rosmania was also uncertain as to the details surrounding the day the dais was placed in AMM. She testified that the dais was installed after her daughter’s wedding (which took place in July 2009), but she did not remember which month.[^86] Rosmania said that she was there on the day when Kartini set up the dais, but could not recall who else was there. Further, she “did not see” Gani on that day.[^87] Again, this runs contrary to the Plaintiff’s position that the dais had been set up on or about 8 May 2009, where Rosmania, Yusoff, Gani and Kartini had been present.

76     Third, Rosmania was unable to state with certainty the alleged terms which were agreed to at the meeting with representatives from AMM. She referred to the “conditions” which were raised at the meeting, but it was not clear from her evidence what these “conditions” comprised. She raised that Kartini would profit from whatever was “outside of the mosque”:[^88]

> Q… Can I ask again what are these conditions?

> AI would like---I was looking for funds to build a dais. With the conditions Kartini said. When Kartini built the dais at the mosque, whatever profits from whoever who made the rental with the mosque, the---it will go to the mosque. Unless, the person booked Kartini from outside, then it will be Kartini’s right, Kartini agreed.

> …

> QAnd did every member of the board agree with Kartini coming in and building the dais?

> AAgreed. With the conditions that I have stated.

> QThe conditions that were proposed by Kartini, is that correct?

> AIt was me who stated it. So, they agreed.

> QAnd this condition is, whatever profits that is made with the rental will go to the mosque. Unless, the person books something extra. Then, it will go to Kartini. Correct? Is this the condition?

> AI’ve said, whatever that is in the mosque is the mosque’s rights. Whatever that is outside of the mosque, it will be Kartini’s rights.

77     Rosmania was then questioned on the draft proposal sent on 30 April 2009. While she said that not all the terms set out therein were agreed to at the meeting, she was not able to state definitely which were adopted and which were not. In addition, she testified during examination-in-chief that AMM would engage the Plaintiff’s services for as long as she was with the mosque:[^89]

> Q… This was a proposal from Kartini to yourself and Salamah. It says, “Terms of service proposal letter.” Does this document look familiar to you?

> ALike---like have. These are the conditions.

> QBut you are saying these are the conditions?

> AYes.

> QAnd the conditions was what was agreed at the board meeting, correct?

> AFor example, for the cars, we did not take it. So far, we took from what I know. If people were to make their solemnisation there, and---and they take pictures at the dais, that’s ours. For food, if they use other catering, it’s fine.

> QSo---

> ADoesn’t---doesn’t have to be Kartini’s.

> QSo, food doesn’t have to be Kartini’s? What about décor? Does it have to be Kartini’s?

> ALike I said, only the dais for Kar---the dais from Kartini. Every 3 months, she will change.

> QSo, can you take dais from somebody else? ‘Cause you said catering can be somebody else. So, can dais be from somebody else?

> ANow, the problem is cannot because **_we have the condition that we will take from her the decor. For as long as I am with the mosque_**. \[emphasis added\]

78     During cross-examination, Rosmania reiterated her employment with AMM as being important to the arrangement with the Plaintiff:[^90]

> QAnd when you left the Mosque Management Board in 2011. You told her you are leaving and if she wants she can take her dais.

> AYes, I told her---I told her that I was leaving. I told her if she wants to leave, leave now. Because if there are any problems there will be no one to help her. But she said, “Oh, no, I would like to stay because Yusoff is good with me.” And she was able to work with Yusoff.

> QSo, you were really the main point between you---you were the one neg---negotiating and dealing with Kartini throughout the time you are at the mosque.

> AYes.

79     The personal relationship between Rosmania and Kartini also appeared to be a key aspect of AMM’s arrangement with the Plaintiff:[^91]

> A… All the committees will have a baby, so Kartini is like my baby.

> QKati---did you say “baby”?

> A“Baby”. Like I---like it is my own responsibilities, this wedding decor.

80     Rosmania was asked to clarify during re-examination on whether decorators other than the Plaintiff could be engaged. Rosmania merely said that during the period she was there, no clients had requested as such. She did not reply affirmatively as to whether or not alternative decorators could be engaged:[^92]

> QSo, if a client wants to bring their own decorator to change Kartini’s dais. Can they do it?

> ALike I said from at---for as long as that I was there, there were not---there weren’t any changes.

> QN---No, but---but were there other decorators that came in?

> AFor as long that I was there, there was no one who requested as such, only for food.

81     The extracts from Rosmania’s evidence show that she was unaware of what the terms of the Oral Contract were. In particular, I found it telling that she was unable to state definitely whether or not other decorators other than the Plaintiff could be engaged. This strongly suggests that the terms of the alleged Oral Contract had not been deliberated by parties and it was more likely an informal arrangement which was contingent on Rosmania’s presence in AMM and her personal relationship with Kartini.

82     In the premises, I find that the oral evidence of Gani, Kartini and Rosmania do not show that the May 2009 Meeting had taken place and/or that the Oral Contract had been concluded at that meeting.

##### (iii)   Assessment of the evidence of the Defendant’s witnesses

83     Zulkifli and Shukor had both stated in their Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief that they were not present at any May 2009 Meeting as alleged where the Oral Contract had purportedly been entered into.[^93] During cross-examination, they insisted that there was no such meeting as they had never met Gani and Kartini prior to the trial.[^94] They further denied that they could have forgotten that a meeting with Gani and Kartini had taken place, for the same reason that they had not met Gani and Kartini before.[^95]

84     However, I did not in general consider the evidence of Zulkifli and Shukor to be helpful as their recollection of the events tended to be weak. Their answers to many of the questions posed by Plaintiff’s counsel during cross-examination were that they were unable to recall. Shukor had further admitted while on the stand that he was a “forgetful person”.[^96] It was therefore difficult for me to accept that whilst they could not remember the details surrounding other events in 2009, they could be sure that they were not present in a meeting with Gani and Kartini, and/or that they had never met Gani and Kartini before. Accordingly, I place little reliance on Zulkifli’s and Sukor’s evidence.

85     Saifulbahri similarly testified that he had not seen Gani and/or Kartini in the period before 8 May 2009.[^97] It was at this point that Plaintiff’s counsel had asked that Saifulbahri produce the minutes of board meetings for this period as documentary evidence of his allegation. Minutes of Meeting of the AMMMB from January to June 2009 were produced on the day the court next sat for trial, and Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed that they contained no reference to any dealings with the Plaintiff or contract with the Plaintiff (see paragraphs 39 to 42 above). Saifulbahri also said that he had never had a board meeting with Gani and Kartini in attendance, whether after July 2009 or otherwise[^98], and that he was only introduced to Kartini much later.[^99]

86     With regard to the installation of the dais in the function room of AMM, Saifulbahri had initially averred in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief that he was “not notified of this installation”, and that it was Rosmania “who had allowed the Plaintiff to put up the dais in \[AMM\] without first obtaining the approval of the \[AMMMB\].”[^100] Notwithstanding that, he then said during cross-examination that Rosmania did inform the board, on an informal basis, that one of her contacts could put up the dais. While Saifulbahri did not state exactly when Rosmania had informed the board, he mentioned that it was when the board had gone to “visit … the mosque” during the “preparation”. This strongly suggests that the conversation with Rosmania would have been before the opening ceremony:[^101]

> AUh, actually Rosmania, uh, did---did, uh, inform us that she have a---a contact that uh, can put up this. So, at that time there is also another member, ‘Rozana’ who---who also, uh, say that we also have contact and there are other people also wants to, um, contribute. So, at that time we were discussing and we have not made any decision. But it’s a---it’s---the time happened so fast that Rosmania able to get, uh---uh, this Kar---Kartini to s---to set up. So, when we saw the thing is there, so, we say okay. I mean more or less we can’t, uh, force them to---to remove it because it’s all just through the discussion.

> QSo you said Rosmania informed you. When you say “you,” are you talking about you personally or the board?

> AThe board. I mean the---during the---because when we go for, uh, visit to the mosque and all that. Uh, the idea of putting up this, uh, dais is---is good for the mosque. We … all agree that it is good to---to put the dais so that, uh, when people see, that means they can use the mosque for the wedding. But the decision to who actually put in is a---is superceded by the event that Rosmania uh, act---acted quickly, lah, in that sense. Because I remember there are other members also who suggest and have contacts.

> QNo. So, when Rosmania informed you or the board, was that during a board meeting?

> ANo, it’s during one of the, uh---when we do the prep---

> QInformal---

> Apreparation---

> Qdiscussion.

> Ayah, informal discussion.

87     This conversation that Rosmania had with the board does not however show that the May 2009 Meeting had taken place. I do not consider this as being in contradiction with Saifulbahri’s testimony that he had not met Kartini and Gani at a board meeting in May 2009, and that he had only met Kartini much later.

88     Saifulbahri also clarified during cross-examination that he had seen the dais during the opening ceremony of AMM which spanned three days from 15 to 17 May 2009, though he was not sure if he had seen it before the opening ceremony:[^102]

> QSo, did you notice the dais on 15th, 16th, and or 17th May 2009? Yes or no, Sir.

> A(pause – 00:00:14) Yes, yes, the---the dais was there.

> …

> QSo, are you telling the Court that for the 1 week before the consecration, you didn’t notice the dais until the consecration itself?

> AI can’t remember, I can’t recall.

89     In my assessment, I find Saifulbahri to be a truthful witness. While on the stand, he took time to think through the questions posed to him, and clarified his recollection of the events in response to the questions posed and the documents that were highlighted to him.

90     With regard to Yusoff, he said during cross-examination that he had not met Gani and Kartini in or around May 2009. He first met Kartini sometime in the middle of July 2010 and he had first met Gani one or two years later.[^103] Yusoff testified that he had met Kartini in July 2010 when she came to AMM to prepare the décor for a wedding to be held there[^104], during which he had proposed the informal arrangement for AMM to work with the Plaintiff. As regards the installation of the dais, Yusoff insisted that he had only seen it for the first time in August 2009, and when he asked Rosmania about the dais, she said that it was a gift from the Plaintiff.[^105] When counsel for the Plaintiff referred Yusoff to the photographs of the dais as uploaded onto AMM’s Facebook page, he replied that he could not recall seeing the dais during the consecration ceremony as he had been “very busy” during the ceremony.[^106]

91     I consider Yusoff to be a less reliable witness than Saifulbahri. I find that his oral evidence was inconsistent at times. For example, with regard to his meeting with Kartini in July 2010, his written evidence in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief was that he had informed her that an informal arrangement could be worked out as a gesture of reciprocation for the Plaintiff’s gift of the dais.[^107] However, during cross-examination, Yusoff said that this was something that they “discussed” and it was not his idea.[^108] However, he subsequently said that he had “asked the board first” before talking to Kartini in July 2010:[^109]

> Q… Let’s talk about the July 2010 when initially, you talked to Kartini and you agree, “No one to put … up dais…. I will refer the clients to you … I will put up the name card with the CSO … all the things like that.”

> AYah.

> QWas that you approving or did you---

> AThe board.

> Qcheck with the board?

> AI---I---I asked the board first.

92     The Plaintiff has submitted that little or no weight should be given to the Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief and oral evidence of the Zulkifli, Shukor, Saifulbahri and Yusoff (the “4 DWs”) as they had admitted during cross-examination that they had discussed the contents of their affidavits prior to the commissioning of the same.[^110] The Plaintiff also refers to the identical/near identical paragraphs in the affidavits of the 4 DWs in support of its submission that there had been collusion amongst them.[^111] The Plaintiff submits[^112] that such collusion amongst the 4 DWs is in breach of the first rule laid down in the Court of Appeal decision of _Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA and ors_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 894</span> (“_Ernest_”), where such breach may, depending on the circumstances, lead the court to accord less weight (or even no weight) to the resulting testimony (_Ernest_ at \[137\]-\[140\]). This “first rule in _Ernest_” relied upon by the Plaintiff states that (at \[138\] of _Ernest_):

> First, and most obviously, the solicitor in preparing (not _coaching_ or _training_) the witness must not allow other persons – including the solicitor – to _actually supplant or supplement_ the witness’s own evidence_._ (italics in original)

93     As emphasised in _Ernest_ (at \[136\]), the “line that must not be crossed is this: the witness’s evidence must remain his own.” The question before the court is therefore whether the 4 DWs had, further to discussion amongst themselves, put before the court a state of affairs that was different from their own recollection, _ie_, whether they had allowed the other three witnesses to “actually supplant or supplement” their own evidence. To this end, I am of the opinion that identical/near identical wording in the Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief of the 4 DWs is not in itself evidence of collusion, if such wording reflected the witness’s own recollection.

94     The parts of the affidavits of the 4 DWs that the Plaintiff takes issue with is in relation to whether there were meetings between the Plaintiff and the AMM representatives sometime in or around early May 2009. The 4 DWs’ evidence on affidavit is that they were unable to recall whether the meetings had taken place.

95     Zulkifli had testified that the 4 DWs “never discussed” about what was going to be in their affidavits.[^113] On the other hand, Shukor, Saifulbahri and Yusoff said that there had been a discussion.[^114] Notwithstanding that, there was nothing in their evidence to suggest that Shukor, Saifulbahri and Yusoff had decided to collude during that discussion to put forth evidence that was not their own (_ie_, that they actually recalled that meeting(s) had taken place but decided to collectively state that they were unable to recall). In this regard, Shukor expressly disagreed during cross-examination that that it was an agreed affidavit between the 4 DWs, but that all 4 DWs had “the same fact pattern”. Saifulbahri said that they discussed as they were “talking about the same thing”. Yusoff explained that they discussed as they wanted to “confirm whether the meeting … actually appeared or not”. On the facts before me, I do not think that there is sufficient evidence to show that the 4 DWs had colluded in their evidence. The present facts can be distinguished from those in _Ernest_, where the circumstances were such that the Court of Appeal found that serious doubt had to be cast on whether one of the witnesses’ evidence had been his own. In _Ernest_, there was in evidence a document which appeared to be a predictive script for the witness. Further, the witness’s daughter had conceded that the said document was a “transcript and script”. Evidence had also been led on what transpired at witness training sessions, during which the witness would be led through the question again when he made a mistake in his practice answer to ensure that he answered the question correctly.

96     Having considered the oral evidence of the 4 DWs, I find that they do not show that the May 2009 Meeting had taken place and/or that the Oral Contract had been concluded at that meeting.

#### (C)   Subsequent conduct of the parties

97     Before I discuss the evidence on the conduct of parties subsequent to the alleged May 2009 Meeting and the purported conclusion of the Oral Contract, I first set out the law in relation to the use of subsequent conduct to prove the existence of a contract. The Defendant has highlighted _ARS_, where the High Court expressed its reservations about using the conduct of parties (_ARS_ at \[90\]):

> I have my reservations about using the conduct of parties to prove the existence of a contract. There may be some cases where there is clear conduct which points one way and not to another, but given the complex relationships between human beings, more often than not, conduct can be explained by a number of reasons which does not have only one explanation or there may be varying degrees of weight pointing to one conclusion…

98     Nonetheless, the High Court proceeded to consider the conduct of parties, and found on the facts of _ARS_ that the conduct of parties was not clear evidence that the agreements existed or did not exist (at \[111\]).

99     In response, the Plaintiff submitted that this court should be guided by the Court of Appeal decision of _Centre for Laser and Aesthetic Medicine Pte Ltd v GPK Clinic (Orchard) Pte Ltd and ors_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 180</span> (“_Centre for Laser_”), where the court discussed the relevance of parties’ subsequent conduct in the context of contractual interpretation (and not formation). In particular, the court stated (at \[50\]-\[51\]):

> 50    The courts have traditionally been cautious about using events subsequent to the formation of a contract to interpret the contract. As this court warned in _Hewlett-Packard Singapore (Sales) Pte Ltd v Chin Shu Hwa Corrina_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 1083</span> (“_Corrina Chin_”) at \[54\]–\[55\]:

>> 54    … post-contractual conduct … must be viewed with the utmost scrutiny as well as concern. Although the Singapore courts have not ruled out such conduct as evidence that might aid them in the ascertainment of the relevant context, there has been no definitive view expressed by way of a positive endorsement (see Zurich Insurance at \[132(d)\]). This is because consideration of such conduct would tend to lead the court away from the objective exercise of interpretation and, on the contrary, tend to introduce a great deal of subjectivity and uncertainty instead.

>> 55    Pursuant to the objective principle of interpretation, the **court is concerned with the expressed intentions of the parties, and not their subjective intentions**_. The standpoint adopted is that of a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time the contract was formed. The extrinsic material sought to be admitted must always go towards proof of what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon._ **_The conduct of the parties post-contract, in so far as they reveal the subjective intention of the parties, will generally be irrelevant in this exercise_**_. It is for this reason, amongst others, that the courts have precluded the reference to subsequent conduct of the parties in the construction of contracts. …_

> 51     _While there is no blanket prohibition in the use of subsequent conduct in contractual interpretation (Corrina Chin at \[56\] and Zurich Insurance (\[34\] supra) at \[132(d)\]), it is_ **_in general only of relevance if the subsequent conduct provides cogent evidence of the parties’ agreement at the time when the contract was concluded_** _. …_ (italics in original; bold and italics added)

100    It is clear from _Centre for Laser_ that subsequent conduct of parties will generally only be relevant where they shed light on the parties’ intention and agreement at the time the contract was concluded, and not any subjective intention of what either party construed the contract to be. Bearing in mind the legal principles, I now turn to the evidence before the court.

101    The Plaintiff refers to nine instances of subsequent conduct in support of its case that there was a valid and binding Oral Contract comprising the Salient Conditions. With respect, I am unable to see how these instances of subsequent conduct relied upon by the Plaintiff can shed any light on the agreement of parties leading to the conclusion of any alleged Oral Contract. These subsequent conduct of parties are equivocal and inconclusive of parties’ agreement at the material time. They could have taken place even if I were to accept the Defendant’s case that there had only been an informal arrangement between parties for the AMMMB to refer weddings to the Plaintiff out of goodwill to reciprocate the Plaintiff’s gift of the dais. I will explain my reasons in turn.

102    First, the Plaintiff avers that the payments made by the AMMMB to the Plaintiff from July 2010 to April 2015 show that the AMMMB had intended to be bound by the Salient Conditions of the Oral Contract, the Subsequent Agreement and the March 15 Agreement.[^115] I did not think that this provided cogent evidence of parties’ agreement of the Oral Contract. The AMMMB could have made such payments pursuant to the informal arrangement. Further, the payments made by the AMMMB to the Plaintiff did not make any references to the Oral Contract and/or the May 2009 Meeting. Correspondence surrounding the payments similarly did not make reference to the same.

103    Second, the Plaintiff submits that the conduct of the AMMMB in not informing the Plaintiff that the Oral Contract, Subsequent Agreement and March 15 Agreement were allegedly rejected by the AMMMB and in continuing to request for the Plaintiff’s services even after the alleged rejection indicates that AMMMB intended to be bound by the Subsequent Agreement and March 15 Agreement for the year of 2015.[^116] The Plaintiff’s argument is premised on there being an Oral Contract in the first place, which is the very issue this exercise seeks to resolve. The AMMMB could have failed to inform the Plaintiff of the rejection on the basis that the Oral Contract, Subsequent Agreement and March 15 Agreement had not been entered into in the first place. This instance of subsequent conduct is therefore neither here nor there.

104    Third, the AMMMB did not inform the Plaintiff that the payment of $2,000 for January 2015 was made by third party sponsors.[^117] The Plaintiff submitted that Syahedah and Yusoff only needed to obtain the third party sponsorship because the AMMMB had approved the Subsequent Agreement, and the AMMMB need not have paid if there had not been a valid contract. To my mind, it does not necessarily follow that payment of the $2,000 meant that the Oral Contract was in existence. There may be other reasons for why the $2,000 was paid. There was no evidence before me that showed that the AMMMB was aware that $2,000 had been paid to the Plaintiff. The bank statement recording the funds transfer does not show which account the money was transferred from.[^118] The minutes of the board meeting held on 16 January 2015 stated that the AMMMB had preferred an itemised billing schedule as opposed to one at a flat rate of $2,000.[^119] The documentary evidence corroborates Syahedah’s evidence that the mosque’s funds were not utilised in the payment of $2,000 to the Plaintiff.[^120] In the premises, I am unable to consider this payment of $2,000 to the Plaintiff as cogent evidence that parties had agreed on the Salient Conditions of the Oral Contract.

105    Fourth, the Plaintiff avers that there would have been no possible reason for the AMMMB to offer a goodwill payment to the Plaintiff as well as to allow them to take back the dais if there was no Oral Contract, Subsequent Agreement or March 15 Agreement.[^121] I disagree. The offer of the goodwill payment does not shed light on what parties had intended at the time the alleged Oral Contract was entered into. The email of 2 December 2015 sent by Syahedah to the Plaintiff set out the offer of goodwill payment by the AMMMB. No reference was made to any May 2009 Meeting, Oral Contract, Subsequent Agreement or March 15 Agreement in that email. The AMMMB had based its goodwill payment on the Plaintiff’s price list for the rental of dais which was edited in January 2015. No reference was made to the price of wedding décor, which was the subject of the Oral Contract, in the said email. Accordingly, I do not agree that the only plausible reason for the AMMMB to offer a goodwill payment was due to the existence of the alleged agreements.

106    Fifth, the Plaintiff states that the AMMMB led the Plaintiff to believe that the Oral Contract, Subsequent Agreement and the March 15 Agreement were valid and enforceable as the AMMMB and Syahedah had made continuous representations to the Plaintiff that it could carry on fulfilling its obligations in providing wedding decoration services to the mosque.[^122] Again, these representations relating to the provision of wedding decoration services could equally be borne out from the informal arrangement and does not show parties’ intentions in entering into any alleged Oral Contract.

107    Sixth, the AMMMB inserted only the Plaintiff’s package price into AMM’s wedding package.[^123] The Plaintiff alleges that the wedding package brochure[^124] was from 2009, and it is evidence of the Oral Contract. In response, the Defendant submits that the wedding package brochure was in fact undated and there is no evidence to show that it was from 2009. Accordingly, the Defendant’s case is that AMM had only inserted the Plaintiff’s package price of $1,500 into the brochure after July 2010, when Yusoff spoke to Kartini and arrived at the informal arrangement.[^125] I agree with the Defendant that the brochure was undated, and I am unable to come to a conclusive finding on when the Plaintiff’s package price had been inserted into the brochure. The circumstances surrounding this instance of subsequent conduct are unclear and inconclusive of parties’ intentions at the time the alleged Oral Contract was made.

108    Seventh, the Plaintiff’s business cards were kept at the reception area of AMM and given to potential customers.[^126] The Plaintiff submits that this was pursuant to the Oral Contract, which gave rise to a legal obligation for the Defendant to exclusively refer wedding services to the Plaintiff. I did not think that this subsequent conduct was cogent evidence of parties’ agreement. As the Defendant has highlighted, this could have been done pursuant to the informal arrangement to refer the Plaintiff’s services, and not pursuant to any obligations under the alleged Oral Contract.[^127]

109    Eighth, the AMMMB displayed only the Plaintiff’s wedding décor images to potential customers for wedding events and failed to mention that customers could get external decorators if they wished.[^128] The Plaintiff relied on the evidence of Zakiah, a customer who had engaged the Plaintiff’s wedding services, for this submission. Zakiah stated during cross-examination that she was under the impression that the Plaintiff was the only party who could provide wedding services at AMM. The Defendant however highlighted that Zakiah had also testified that it was only her belief that the Plaintiff had exclusive rights.[^129] I further note that there was no evidence that Zakiah had confirmed with Syahedah or AMM that the Plaintiff was the exclusive decorator. Zakiah’s evidence is therefore inconclusive.

110    Ninth, the Plaintiff submits that the AMMMB only referred wedding events to the Plaintiff since July 2010 (save for two weddings in 2013 and January 2015). However, while these two weddings had engaged external decorators other than the Plaintiff, the wedding dais was not utilised, and in any event the Plaintiff was “informed and consent granted”.[^130] The Defendant objects to the Plaintiff’s submission that the AMMMB had granted consent to these two weddings.[^131] Upon reviewing the transcript of the WhatsApp conversations between Syahedah and Kartini on this point[^132], I agree with the Defendant that Syahedah had not sought the Plaintiff’s consent in referring the event to external decorators. In fact, when informed that an external party was doing the wedding decoration, Kartini did not raise any concern or objections to Syahedah.[^133] This did not appear to me to be the response of someone who had expected to be referred for every instance when wedding services were required. The Plaintiff’s reliance on this instance of subsequent conduct is not wholly accurate on the facts. I therefore do not consider this as cogent evidence of the parties’ agreement to enter into the alleged Oral Contract.

111    The Defendant has similarly referred to various instances of subsequent conduct in support of its position that there had been no May 2009 Meeting and/or Oral Contract as alleged.

112    The Defendant submits that there was no written communication by the Plaintiff to AMM setting out the terms of the alleged Oral Contract[^134] and this clearly shows that no Oral Contract was entered into in May 2009. The Plaintiff’s position on this is that Gani and Kartini had relied on the Defendant’s representations that a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) containing the Salient Conditions would be provided to them.[^135] In particular, Kartini said during cross-examination that Saifulbahri had agreed to the Oral Contract. He instructed that the dais be placed first as the opening was “very near” and told Kartini that he would get his staff to prepare the MOU thereafter.[^136] Kartini also testified that she had constantly been requesting for a MOU from the AMMMB (up till 2015) to no avail.[^137] Further, the Oral Contract was formed in a house of worship, and as “god-fearing Muslims”, to “reduce the Oral Contract to written terms would be an affront to the AMMMB parties as it would imply that \[Gani and Kartini\] did not trust the AMMMB parties to honour their obligations”.[^138]

113    As discussed at paragraphs 56 to 70 and 85 to 89 above, I find Saifulbahri’s evidence to be more reliable than that of Gani and Kartini. In addition, I note that the Plaintiff and/or Kartini had not, before trial, referred to Saifulbahri as the AMMMB representative who allegedly informed Gani and Kartini that an MOU would be prepared. In fact, the Statement of Claim refers to Yusoff as the one who had concluded the Oral Contract with the Plaintiff.[^139] The Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief of Kartini and Gani are also silent on the exact AMMMB representative who had said that an MOU would be prepared. I further consider it contradictory for Kartini to both consider it an affront to request for an MOU as “god-fearing Muslims”[^140], and to constantly request for an MOU. I do not therefore accept the Plaintiff’s evidence on this point.

114    While the lack of any written communication by the Plaintiff to AMM setting out the terms of the alleged Oral Contract in itself may not have been cogent evidence of the parties’ agreement, I find that the lack of such written communication taken together with the inconsistent oral evidence of the Plaintiff in relation to the reduction of the Oral Contract to a written form after its conclusion strongly suggests that the Oral Contract never existed.

115    The Defendant next submits that there was no written communication by the Plaintiff to AMM from 2009 to July 2010 seeking referrals of weddings[^141], and these similarly show that no Oral Contract was entered into in May 2009. During cross-examination, Gani had initially claimed that there was written communication in this regard, but was ultimately unable to produce the same.[^142] Kartini also testified that she had not questioned AMM from 2009 to July 2010 because she trusted her “brother and sisters who are Muslim working in a mosque.”[^143] I do not agree with the Defendant on this point. I am of the opinion that the Plaintiff’s failure to seek referrals in writing from 2009 to July 2010 is inconclusive of parties’ intention (or not) to enter into any Oral Contract. There is insufficient evidence for me to conclude that the Plaintiff must necessarily have made enquiries as to the lack of referrals, especially in relation to how the Plaintiff had interacted with representatives from AMM from 2010 to 2013.

116    The Defendant also avers that there was no mention of the Oral Contract concluded in 2009 for the exclusive provision of services at the meetings of 9and 17November 2015, and this shows that there was no Oral Contract. The meeting on 9 November 2015 was attended by Gani, Kartini, Razin and Sharifuddin. The meeting on 17 November 2015 was attended by Gani, Kartini, Razin, Sharifuddin, Yusoff and Syahedah. Both meetings were audio-recorded by Kartini and transcripts of the meetings were in evidence before the court.[^144] I agree that the lack of reference to any dealings in 2009 (much less to any meeting in early May 2009), and to any contract entered into between parties at that time suggests that parties had no meeting and/or agreement in or around early May 2009. At the two meetings, the Plaintiff’s representatives only referred at various times to a working relationship with AMM from 2010 onwards, which was when the Plaintiff’s wedding services were first engaged. The Plaintiff’s representatives never made any mention of the dais being in AMM since 2009 or any meetings with AMM representatives in 2009.

#### (D)   Conclusion on Issue 1

117    Taking the evidence in its totality, I find that the Plaintiff has failed to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the May 2009 Meeting existed, and that a valid and enforceable Oral Contract had been concluded at that meeting. I find that the evidence suggests that the arrangement between the Plaintiff and AMM was informal and depended heavily first on Rosmania, and then on Syahedah, to refer any requests for wedding services to the Plaintiff. This was a result of the personal and friendly relationship Rosmania and Syahedah had with Kartini, and not arising from any contractual obligations. The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant for damages arising from a breach of the Oral Contract must necessarily fail.

### Issue 2: Did the Oral Contract contain terms for the exclusive referral of services and exclusive use of Plaintiff’s property?

118    Given that I have found that there was no Oral Contract, it is not strictly necessary for me to decide on whether there was a term and/or condition of the Oral Contract that provided for the (a) exclusive referral of services by AMM to the Plaintiff (the “exclusive referral term”), and (b) exclusive use of the Plaintiff’s property in AMM by the Plaintiff (the “exclusive use term”). Nonetheless, in the event that I am wrong in concluding that there had been no Oral Contract, I find on the evidence before me that the Oral Contract did not contain the said terms.

119    The Plaintiff’s case is that the exclusive referral term is an express condition of the Oral Contract, the Subsequent Agreement, and the March 15 Agreement.[^145] With regard to the “exclusive use term”, the Plaintiff appeared to have dropped this argument at the close of trial. As the Defendant has rightly pointed out, there were no submissions in the PCS on the same.[^146] Neither were there any submissions on the exclusive use term in the PRS. I will therefore only be focusing on the allegation of the presence of the exclusive referral term.

120    The Plaintiff first relied on Clause 4(5) of the draft proposal sent on 30 April 2009[^147], which stated that the Plaintiff would be “priority company in providing venue decorations for any events held in \[AMM\] unless, otherwise upon mutual agreement by \[the Plaintiff\] and \[AMM\]”. The Plaintiff submits that this is analogous to a term of exclusive referral.[^148] On the other hand, the Defendant submits that on an objective interpretation, “priority” has a different meaning from “exclusive” and the draft proposal does not prove the existence of any “exclusive referral term”.[^149]

121    For the reasons discussed at paragraphs 43 to 49 above, I do not think that the draft proposal sent on 30 April 2009 shows that (a) the May 2009 Meeting took place, and/or (b) the Oral Contract was entered into. For the same reasons, I am of the opinion that the draft proposal does not show that the exclusive referral term was incorporated into the Oral Contract. In addition, the evidence on the meaning of “priority” in the draft proposal was also one-sided from the Plaintiff – Gani and Kartini could only give evidence of what they had understood “priority” to mean.[^150] There was no evidence of what was the common contemplation of parties.

122    I am also unable to agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that the email from Kartini to Syahedah dated 23 February 2015 (and its enclosures) showed that the exclusive referral term had been an “enduring term of the business arrangement between the parties”.[^151] I agree with the Defendant that the said email did not make any reference to the alleged May 2009 Meeting and/or the Oral Contract concluded then.[^152] It is therefore wholly inconclusive as evidence of the exclusive referral term as being part of the Oral Contract.

123    The Plaintiff next relied on the oral testimony of Rosmania, which it submits confirms the existence of the exclusive referral term.[^153] My findings on Rosmania’s evidence have been set out in paragraphs 71 to 81 above. In essence, I do not find that Rosmania’s evidence shows that parties had deliberated and agreed on the inclusion of the exclusive referral term in the Oral Contract.

124    Finally, the Plaintiff also relied on the following instances of subsequent conduct of the AMMMB as confirming the existence of the exclusive referral term in the Oral Contract: (a) inserting only the Plaintiff’s package price in the mosque’s wedding package, (b) displaying only the Plaintiff’s business cards to potential customers, (c) displaying only the Plaintiff’s wedding décor images to potential customers for wedding events and failing to mention that customers could get external decorators if they wished, and (d) only referring wedding events to the Plaintiff since July 2010.[^154] My reasons for why these instances of subsequent conduct are inconclusive of the Oral Contract (and therefore of any exclusive referral term therein) are set out at paragraphs 107 to 110 above.

125    For the reasons given above, I find that even if there was an Oral Contract, it did not contain the exclusive referral term.

### Issues 3 and 4: Breach and damages

126    Following from my findings on issues 1 and 2 that there is no Oral Contract or exclusive referral term, the issues of any breach of the Oral Contract and the damages flowing therefrom do not arise.

127    Nonetheless, I wish to make an observation as regards the Plaintiff’s case. The Plaintiff’s claim for general damages arising out of its loss of business from April 2015 to December 2015 is based upon the itemised billing in the March 15 Agreement.[^155] However, it is also the Plaintiff’s position that the March 15 Agreement has not been breached, and the March 15 Agreement is only meant to assist the court in assessing the general damages.[^156]

128    I find this a curious position to adopt. Damages must necessarily flow from a breach of the contract that is applicable and in force between parties at the material time. It is the Plaintiff’s position that the Oral Contract, Subsequent Agreement and March 15 Agreement all contain the Salient Conditions, but vary in payment terms. Even taking the Plaintiff’s case as it is, the Oral Contract must have come to an end when the Subsequent Agreement came into force, and the Subsequent Agreement must also have come to an end when the March 15 Agreement came into force. The Oral Contract and the March 15 Agreement cannot operate alongside each other as they contain conflicting payment terms for the same set of Salient Conditions. The breach in question as alleged by the Plaintiff occurred from April 2015 to December 2015 when the AMMMB allegedly failed to refer all wedding services at AMM exclusively to the Plaintiff.[^157] By April 2015, the purported Oral Contract between parties must have ended and the applicable contract (if any) should have been the March 15 Agreement. Any claim for damages should properly be based on a breach of the March 15 Agreement and not the Oral Contract.

## Conclusion

129    For the reasons given above, I find that the Plaintiff has not established its case on a balance of probabilities and its claim fails. On the facts of the case, I find that there was no May 2009 Meeting and/or Oral Contract and the Defendant was not contractually obligated to refer exclusively to the Plaintiff all wedding services.

130    I had asked that parties make their submissions on costs in their respective written closing submissions, so that I may address the same in this judgment.

131    The Plaintiff sought party-and-party costs of $30,000 (exclusive of disbursements) in the event the court found in its favour.[^158] The Defendant proposed costs fixed at $50,000 (inclusive of all disbursements), plus the sum of $4,319.30 (being the Defendant’s half-share of the transcription costs), amounting to $54,319.30, in the event that the Plaintiff’s claim is dismissed.[^159] The Plaintiff has not proposed a counter-sum in the event its claim is dismissed.

132    Given that the Plaintiff has failed in its claims, and as costs should follow the event, I award costs in favour of the Defendant. The trial of this matter was heard over seven days[^160], and a total of 14 witnesses were called to testify in court. With regard to the quantum of the Plaintiff’s claim, this had been initially particularised in Gani’s AEIC and Kartini’s AEIC as $230,000.[^161] Counsel for the Plaintiff subsequently represented during a pre-trial conference on 25 October 2018 that the claim was above $40,000. During cross-examination, Gani had similarly indicated a reduced range of $30,000 to $40,000.[^162] This figure was revised yet again in the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions and Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions, which quantified the Plaintiff’s claim at (a) $81,600 for general damages, and (b) $4,500 for special damages.[^163]

133    Having considered parties’ submissions on costs, and having regard to the length of trial and the complexity of the matter, I find that costs of $45,000 (inclusive of all disbursements and transcription costs) is an appropriate sum to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant.

134    In conclusion, the Plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with costs to the Defendant fixed at $45,000 (inclusive of all disbursements and transcription costs).
