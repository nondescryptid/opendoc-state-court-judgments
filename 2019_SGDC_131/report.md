24 June 2019

### District Judge Edgar Foo:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 61 year old male Singaporean, had claimed trial to the following charge:-

_You … are charged that you, on 28 February 2018, at or about 5.30pm, at the void deck of Blk 704 West Coast Road Singapore 120704, did commit criminal intimidation, to wit, you threatened to kill your wife Mailavathi d/o Kathikvelu, which threat was uttered in Charisa Leow Si Hui’s presence, when the said Mailavathi d/o Kathikvelu is a person whom Charisa Leow Si Hui was interested in, with intent to cause Charisa Leow Si Hui alarm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under the 2nd limb of section 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)_,

_and further, that you, from_ **_12 October 2017 to 10 February 2019_** _, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act, and while the remission order is in effect you, on_ **_28 February 2018_** _, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, you shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under section 50T of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of_ **_348 Days from 28 February 2018 to 10 February 2019_** _for that offence._

## Punishment Prescribed by Law

2       The punishment prescribed under section 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both; and if the threat is to cause death or grievous hurt, or to cause the destruction of any property by fire, or to cause an offence punishable with death or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years or more, or impute unchastity to a woman, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with both.

3       Section 50S (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed) states:

“**All remission orders subject to basic condition**

**50S.-(1**)    It is the basic condition of every remission order made under Division 2 or 3 that the person released under the remission order –

(a)    shall not commit any offence (not including an offence under section 50Y(1)) while the remission order is in effect; and

(b)    shall not be convicted of that offence and sentenced to any of the following:

(i)    a sentence of imprisonment (not including a default sentence);

(ii)   corrective training;

(iii)   reformative training;

(iv)   preventive detention.

(2)    Where a person commits an offence in breach of the basic condition of his remission order, he shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition on the date of the commission of the offence.

4       Section 50T (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed) states:

**“Breach of basic condition and enhanced sentence**

**50T.-(1**)    When a person commits an offence in breach of the basic condition of his remission order made under Division 2 or 3, the court may, in addition to imposing any sentence on the person for that offence, impose an enhanced sentence for that offence as follows:

(a)    imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the commission of the offence; or

(b)    imprisonment for any term or for life, if the duration of the remission order is for the person’s natural life.

(2)    If a person commits 2 or more offences in breach of the basic condition of his remission order made under Division 2 or 3 –

(a)    the court may, in addition to imposing any sentence on the person for those offences, impose an enhanced sentence under subsection (1) for each of those offences; and

(b)    the aggregate length of all the enhanced sentences imposed under subsection (1) shall not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the earliest offence committed.

5       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the accused not guilty of the offence as charged and acquitted him of the charge.

6       The Prosecution being dissatisfied with my decision., has filed their Notice of Appeal against the acquittal. Accordingly, I set out my reasons for my acquittal.

8       The following facts are undisputed between the parties:-

i.     PW1 is a social worker with CARE CORNER. Her job scope includes helping victims and perpetrators of family violence For victims, PW1 will work with the victims and provide them with a safety plan. For perpetrators, PW1 will work with them to increase their insight on their use of violence as well as to work towards non-violent ways to manage issues and also to implement violence control plans where possible[^1].

ii.     Both the accused and his wife (PW3) have been referred to CARE CORNER by the Ministry of Social and Family Development for family violence issues at home and PW1 is the social worker in charge of their case[^2].

iii.     The accused and PW3 have been having marital issues including issues with their children and divorce[^3]. PW3 has also been a victim of spousal violence and she has been granted PPO against the accused. The accused has been sent to jail for committing family violence against PW3.

iv.     PW1 was working with PW3 to prepare PW3 for the accused’s discharge from prison in October 2017 and she was also referred to the accused and working with him on the same issue.

v.     PW1 had also met up with the accused on a number of occasions as part of her routine visits before the incident on 28 February 2018.

vi.     On 28 February 2018, PW1 conducted a routine home visit and the accused was alone at home. PW1 spoke to the accused at the void deck at Blk 704 West Coast Road Singapore 120704.

vii.     During the session at the void deck, the accused shared with PW1 that he was angry with PW3 over issues with their children and divorce and he subsequently told PW1 that he wanted to murder PW3[^4].

viii.     When the accused told PW1 that he wanted to murder PW3, PW1 asked him what he meant and the accused told PW1 that he could either kill PW3 in her sleep or he would get someone to finish her off[^5].

ix.     PW1 also said that she was alarmed at what the accused had told her[^6].

x.     PW1 then met up with PW3 later on the same day at her work place and she informed PW3 of what PW1 had said and she also accompanied PW3 to Clementi NPC to make a police report relating to the incident[^7].

xi.     PW1 then put a safety plan in place and arranged for PW3 and the children to move to a shelter[^8].

## Prosecution’s Case[^9]

9       The accused does not dispute telling PW1 that he wanted to murder PW3, that he had a plan to do so, that it would be easy to do so either by killing PW3 in her sleep or getting someone to finish her off (“the Remarks”). It is also undisputed that PW1 was in fact alarmed. The only issue in dispute is whether the accused _intended_ to cause PW1 alarm in making the Remarks.

## A.   What amounts to Intention

10     According to the _Halsbury Laws of Singapore_, intention is disclosed when an offender’s _purpose_ is to bring about the constituent elements of the offence, and may also include consequences which an offender “knows are almost certain to do so”. In this case, the Prosecution has to show that the accused’s _purpose_ in making the remarks was to cause PW1 alarm, or alternatively, that he _knows that PW1 is almost certain_ to be alarmed.

## B.   The accused intended to cause alarm to PW1/ knows that PW1 is almost certain to be alarmed

11     The accused offered 2 main reasons why he made the Remarks:

(a)     He viewed PW1 as someone he could share problems with (“the first reason”); and

(b)     He was just expressing his frustration and speaking out of anger (“the second reason”).

12     As regard to the first reason, it is obvious that accused was not in fact ‘sharing’ with PW1 any ‘problem’, in making the Remarks. The very wordings of the Remarks relate solely to what the accused wished to do vis-à-vis PW3, and is not geared at requiring any sort of assistance or meaningful intervention from PW1.

13     As regards to the second reason, the Prosecution accepts that the accused could have been genuinely facing family problems and wished to air his frustrations against his wife. But while that may be his _motive_, i.e. the driving force/ulterior cause inducing him to make those Remarks, it does not equate to his _intent_ i.e. the desired outcome/objective in making those Remarks.

14     Thus, both purported reasons for uttering the Remarks are not helpful in ascertaining the _mens rea_ of the accused. The court should look at the circumstances under which the Remarks were made, and the nuances of the sequence of events, to ascertain the accused’s intention.

15     The accused’s intention can be inferred from the following:

(a)      **The accused’s knowledge of PW1’s role.** The accused knew well that PW1 was a social worker who had been trying to get him to change his ways of using family violence. By making the Remarks to PW1 – Remarks which touched on not just ‘violence’ in general terms but _murder_ - the accused must have known for absolute certainty that PW1 would be alarmed[^10].

(b)      **The details of the Remarks.** The accused did not make one single, isolated and off the cuff remark about wanting to kill his wife. In response to PW1’s query on “what does he mean”[^11], the accused proceeded to _actively emphasize_ to PW1 that he was “serious”. This makes it twice that the accused had announced his murderous intent to PW1. PW1 then questioned the accused further on what the plan was. For the third time, the accused spoke about his intention to murder his wife - he elaborated it “would be easy to kill \[his wife\]” and even prescribed the modalities through which this could be achieved – “killing her in her sleep or getting someone to finish her off”[^12]. In essence, the accused thought it necessary to _impress upon PW1_ just how absolutely serious he was, and to even spell out details to PW1[^13].

(c)      **The fact that PW1 was** **_in fact alarmed_** **further fortifies the fact that the accused intended to alarm her[^14].** Although not an element of the offence per se, the fact that a victim felt alarmed _supports_ the finding of a guilty intent. As the learned Yong CJ observed in _Ameer Akbar_ at \[51\]-\[53\] (cited with approval by the CA in _Liton_ at\[65\]):

Of course, guilty intent was a question of fact to be inferred. Thus, if it could be shown that the victim had some objective basis to apprehend alarm, even if he was never actually alarmed, and the threat was sufficient to overcome the ordinary free will of a firm man (see _Ramanathan Yogendran v PP_ … at \[111\]), that would then fortify a finding of the guilty intent.

The appellant here had threatened to assault the complainant. The fact that the threat was not carried out eventually was irrelevant. On the evidence, it was apparent that the threat was uttered because the appellant was angry, and he wanted to frighten the complainant. The obvious and irresistible inference was that the appellant had uttered the threat with intent to cause alarm to the complainant.

**Clearly, in the light of their relationship, there was some objective basis for the complainant to apprehend alarm over the threat made.** Moreover, **the fact that there was also evidence to show that he was actually alarmed, even though such an element was not required in the charge, reinforced my finding of the relevant guilty intent.** \[Emphasis added in bold\]

16     The manner in which the conversation with PW1 played out leads to the irresistible inference that the accused_’s purpose_ was to cause PW1 alarm, or at the very least, that he knew that PW1 is almost certain to be alarmed. There is no reasonable doubt here.

## C.   Conviction on Amended Charge

17     In the event that the Court disagrees that the accused had the requisite _mens rea_, the Prosecution urged the Court to convict the accused on an amended charge under section 4(1)(a) punishable under section 4(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A).

18     Section 4 Cap 256A reads:

**Harassment, alarm or distress**

4.—(1)    No person shall by any means —

(a)    use any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; … **which is heard, seen or otherwise perceived** by any person (referred to for the purposes of this section as the victim) **likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.**

(2)    Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and, subject to section 8, shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.

(3)    In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (2), it is a defence for the accused person to prove —

(a)    that he had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the communication made, by him would be heard, seen or otherwise perceived by the victim; or

(b)    that his conduct was reasonable.

19     The Prosecution had submitted that a section 4 Cap 256A offence does not require the offender to possess _mens rea_ that his words/behaviour would cause harassment/alarm/distress, only that his words/behaviour is _in fact_ likely to do so. The Court has the power under s 128(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) to amend the charge and convict the accused accordingly. In a clear case, the trial judge should exercise his discretion to effect the necessary amendments to a charge so as to fit the proved facts: _PP v Tan Khee Wan Iris_ \[1994\] 3 SLR 214.

20     Given the above, the Prosecution submitted that they had proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and urged the Court to convict the accused as charged.

## Defence Case**[^15]**

21     The Defence accepts that the accused had said to PW1 that he wanted to kill PW3, and that it would be easy to kill her either in her sleep or getting someone to “_finish her off_”.

22     However, the Defence submitted that the offence of criminal intimidation is not made out because the accused did not have the requisite _mens rea_. Crucially, the Prosecution has proceeded on the basis that the victim is PW1, and not PW3. The Defence was of the view that the accused had no intention to cause alarm to PW1.

## A.   The Requisite Mens Rea is Intention – Anything less would not suffice

23     Section 503 of the Penal Code provides that:

_Whoever threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation of any one in whom that person is interested_, **_with intent to_** _cause alarm to that person, or to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat, commits criminal intimidation._ (emphasis added)

24     The plain wording of the section shows that the requisite level of _mens rea_ for the offence of criminal intimidation is one of _intention_, and nothing less.

25     The Defence had submitted that the law in this regard is trite. The following excerpt from Yeo, Morgan and Chan’s _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_ (Revised 2nd Edition) at pages 88 to 92, is instructive:

“\[4.7\]     _The fault term ‘intention’ is not defined in the Penal Code, leaving the task of doing so for the courts. The following statement by the Bombay High Court in_ Bhagwanl Appaji v Kedari Kashinath _is instructive: ‘The word “intent”, by its etymology, seems to have metaphorical allusion to archery, and implies “aim” and thus connotes ... the one object for which the effort is made.:..’. Similarly, it has been held that intention under the Indian Penal Code denotes ‘a purposeful doing of a thing to achieve a particular end.’ The Indian Supreme Court in_ Jai Prakash v State (Delhi Administration) _has borne out further this purposive nature of intention by contrasting it with knowledge. It said:_

**_The framers of the Code designedly used ·the words “intention” and “knowledge” and it is accepted that the knowledge of the consequences which may result in doing an act is not the same thing as the intention that such consequences should ensue ... As compared to “knowledge”, “intention” requires something more than the mere foresight of the consequences, namely, the purposeful doing of a thing to achieve a particular end ..._**

**_“\[K\]nowledge” as contrasted with “intention” signifies a state of mental realisation with the bare state of conscious awareness of certain facts in which the human mind remains simple and inactive. On the other hand, “intention” is a conscious state in which mental faculties are aroused into activity and summoned into action for the purpose of achieving a conceived end. It means shaping of one's conduct so as to bring about a certain event._**

\[4.8\]  _To these Indian judicial pronouncements could be added descriptions of ‘intention’ by our own courts. The Malaysian Supreme Court in_ Yap Sing Hock v PP _declared that:_

_A man intends to commit the offence ... if \[he\] has foresight (ie knows in advance) that his conduct will lead to the commission of the offence ... and he desires the commission of such offence … \[W\]here foresight above-described is present, but the desire above-described is absent, then it becomes the mens rea of “recklessness”_

_And the Singapore Court of Appeal in_ Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan v PP _approved the following description of intention by Williams:_

_\[H\]e who intends a result usually knows that it will follow, and he who knows the consequences of his act usually intends them. But there may be intention without knowledge, the consequence being desired but not foreknown as certain or even probable. Conversely, there may be knowledge without intention, the consequence being foreknown as the inevitable concomitant of that which is desired, but being itself an object of repugnance rather than desire, and therefore not intended._

_In these two passages, the concept of intention is closely connected with that of desire. This should be avoided since desire introduces an emotional or motivational element that may or may not be present in intention. For example, D's purpose is to kill V in self-defence even if he may not desire to do so since V is his best friend. Accordingly, it would be far better for intention to be defined as purposive or goal oriented._

_…_

\[4.10\]     _Although it is correct to define intention as purpose or goal orientated, that alone is too restrictive. It is submitted that intention should be extended_ **_slightly_** _to cover cases where the accused knew that his or her conduct would, in the ordinary course of events, be_ **_absolutely_** _certain to produce a result. Take, for example, D using an iron pipe to strike at V who is sitting behind the steering wheel of a car, and smashes the windscreen in the process. Although D’s purpose was to injure V, he would also have known for certain that his conduct would damage the windscreen. As such, D could be said to have intended to cause damage to property. …_

\[4.11\]     _Some authorities have gone further to assert that knowledge of a substantial or virtual certainty of a result occurring also amounts to intention. For example, in one Singapore case it was stated that ‘\[a\] person can be said to intend a certain consequence if …he foresaw the consequence as a virtual certainty’. Similarly, the editors of_ Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore _have contended that ‘the meaning attributed to intention may also include consequences which may not necessarily follow from the acts but which an accused knows are almost certain to do so.’ A problem with treating this form of knowledge as ‘intention’ is encountered in relation to the fault element of murder under the Penal Code. The Code distinguishes an intention to cause death (s 300(a)) from knowledge that one’s conduct must in all probability cause death (s 300(d)). Since the latter form of fault is clearly treated as distinct from intention, it is properly regarded as a form of ‘knowledge’. And the concept of intention should, if possible, be given a consistent interpretation throughout the criminal law._

\[4.12\]     _ln sum_, **_‘intention’, wherever it appears as a fault element of an offence, should be defined as constituting the accused's purpose to achieve a result or his or her knowledge that a result was absolutely certain to occur in the ordinary course of events_**_. Given the wording of the homicide provisions_, **_any lesser form of knowledge, including knowledge of the substantial or virtual certainty of a result occurring will not constitute intention_**_. One other case example will suffice by way of illustration. D drops a brick from the top of a high building down to a crowded mall below for the purpose of frightening the pedestrians but not to injure them. A pedestrian is struck and injured by the brick. In these circumstance, D had not intended to cause injury because it was neither his purpose to do so nor did he know that such injury would definitely happen. However, since D knew of the risk of the injury occurring he would be criminally liable for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt which fault element comprises either an intention to cause hurt or knowledge that hurt was likely_.”

(emphasis added)

26     Therefore, the Defence submitted that there is intention only where it was the accused’s _purpose_ to achieve a result, or he had the knowledge that a result was _absolutely_ certain to occur. The authors were careful to clarify that extension of the meaning of intention to include knowledge should only be a _slight_ one, i.e. only cases where the knowledge of a certain result is _absolutely_ certain, like in the example above at \[4.10\] of the passage. Anything less, even knowledge of the substantial or virtual certainty of a result occurring, would not meet the threshold.

27     The Defence also submitted that the legislative intent behind the requisite _mens rea_ for a Section 503 offence is further illuminated by a simple comparison with other applicable offences listed under the same chapter of the Penal Code (i.e. Chapter XXII – Sections 503 to 509). Simply put, the requisite _mens rea_ for each provision is expressly stated on the face of it. It is not for parties to go against parliamentary intent by widening the requisite _mens rea_ for offences with strictly defined _mens rea_, such as in Section 503.

28     For example, Sections 504 and 505 provide that:

**_Section 504 – Intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace:_**

_Whoever intentionally insults, and thereby gives provocation to any person_, **_intending or knowing it to be likely_** _that such provocation will cause him to break the public peace, or to commit any other offence, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both._

**_Section 505 – Statements conducing public mischief:_**

_Whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report in written, electronic or other media —_

(_a_)     **_with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause_** _any officer or serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces or any visiting forces lawfully present in Singapore, or any person to whom section 140B refers, to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in his duty as such;_

(_b_)     **_with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause_** _, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public, whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity; or_

(_c_)     **_with intent to incite, or which is likely to incite_** _, any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons_,

_shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both._ (emphasis added)

29     Whereas in Sections 503 and 509 \[**Tab 1**\], the requisite _mens rea_ is explicitly stated as nothing less than and exclusively _intention_.

**_Section 503 – Criminal intimidation:_**

_Whoever threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation of any one in whom that person is interested_, **_with intent to cause_** _alarm to that person, or to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat, commits criminal intimidation._

**_Section 509 – Word or gesture intended to insult the modesty of a woman:_**

_Whoever_, **_intending to insult_** _the modesty of any woman, utters any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object_, **_intending that such word or sound_** _shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both._ (emphasis added)

30     It is therefore clear that if the requisite _mens rea_ could be anything less than intention, e.g. knowledge that a particular outcome would be likely, this would be plainly stated in the statute, like in Sections 504 and 505 of the Penal Code. In the absence of any other words pertaining to _mens rea_ in Section 503 of the Penal Code, the requisite level of _mens rea_ for the offence of criminal intimidation is only intention. Nothing less would suffice.

31     The offence of criminal intimidation would therefore only be made out if it can be shown that it was the accused’s _purpose_ to cause alarm to PW1 or that he was _absolutely_ certain that his words would cause alarm to PW1. It is clear that knowledge of the substantial or virtual certainty of PW1 being alarmed by his words would _not_ constitute intention.

## B.   The offence is not made out merely because PW1 felt alarmed

32     The Defence also relied on the case of _Chan Yok Tuang v PP_ \[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 895 (“_Chan Yok Tuang_”), the accused person was charged with the offence of criminal intimidation by threatening to cause injury to the reputation of a police officer, one Senior Staff Sergeant Lim. The accused person had allegedly snapped in Hokkien “_I will shoot her to death_”.

33     The High Court stated the following at \[26\]:

“**_The mens rea element of criminal intimidation is constituted from the intention of the maker of the threat_**_. The Charge proceeded on the basis that the threat was made to injure the reputation of SSSgt Lim with the intent of causing alarm to her. However, the SOF clearly states that what the Appellant meant by his words was that he was going to file a complaint against SSSgt Lim. He had neither threatened to injure her physically nor threatened to injure her reputation with intent to cause her alarm._ **_Whatever SSSgt Lim had felt was not what the Appellant had intended. Therefore there was also no mens rea._**_”_ (emphasis added)

34     At trial, PW1 testified that she felt alarmed by what the accused had said to her. However, it is clear from the above passage that the key element is ultimately the intention of the accused person, and whatever the alleged victim may have felt may not be what the accused person intended.

35     Therefore, even though PW1 may have felt alarmed, this does not automatically mean that the charge is made out. In determining whether the _mens rea_ element is satisfied, the focus should be on the accused’s intention, rather than what PW1 felt.

36     This approach is confirmed by the writers of _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_ (Revised 2nd Edition) at page 325 \[11.88\]:

“_On the facts of_ Chua Siew Lin, _the court also easily inferred that the accused had intended to cause alarm. At one point, Yong Pung How CJ appears to suggest that the question is whether alarm was_ actually _caused to the victim: ‘I thought that the conduct of the accused… would be sufficient to cause alarm to any reasonable person in \[the maid’s\] position.’ Although it would not have made any difference on the facts_, **_the question should have been posed in terms of whether the accused_** **intended** **_to cause alarm._**_”_ (emphasis added).

## C.   The accused had no intention to cause alarm to PW1

37     The Defence had submitted that it is trite that the intention of an individual has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case, as it is difficult if not impossible to procure direct evidence to prove intention[^16].

38     The following extract from the case of _Chan Yok Tuang_ at \[27\] is an example of the surrounding circumstances that can be taken into account in determining one’s intention:

_“The previous history of the relationship between the Appellant and SSSgt Lim and the circumstances in which the Appellant was brought to the police station and put in the lock-up throw some light on the intention of the Appellant in uttering the alleged Hokkien words. The SOF shows that SSSgt Lim had conducted regular patrols along Lorong 16 and Lorong 18 Geylang where the Appellant’s hotel was situated… the Appellant was aggrieved as he had been suspected of being a pimp and felt that the regular patrols around his hotel were adversely affecting his business although he had done nothing wrong. Against this backdrop, he was then detained by the police officers, brought to the police station and put in the lock-up because of his past secret society records. For these reasons, the Appellant might have some cause to believe that he had been unfairly treated by the police officers and, in particular, SSSgt Lim. Given the physical environment in which the Appellant found himself, it was unlikely that he would have been so reckless as to threaten to shoot SSSgt Lim. It was more likely that he was venting his anger, annoyance or frustration at the manner in which he perceived he was being treated by the police officers.”_

39     In the present case, similarly, in the present case, taking into account the surrounding circumstances including the history of the relationship and interactions between the accused and PW1, and the context in which the words were uttered, the natural inference would be that the accused had no intention to cause alarm to PW1:

a.     The accused had uttered those words to PW1 as an expression of his frustrations.

b.     The accused had uttered all those things because PW1 had assured him that he could speak to her openly.

c.     There was no reason why the accused would have wanted to cause alarm to PW1, as he viewed her as somebody who was there to help and somebody he could trust.

40     The Defence also highlighted the following:-

## i.   The accused had uttered those words to PW1 as an expression of his frustrations

41     On the material day, PW1 had conducted a routine home visit. During the session between PW1 and the accused, the accused shared with PW1 the problems he faced with his wife and family, and the frustration he felt. This was the typical subject of their meetings. It was in this context that the accused said he wanted to murder PW3.

42     This is clear from the evidence of both PW1 and the accused.

EIC of PW1

“_…during the home visit---during the session where which we had, um, he shared with me that he’s angry with Madam Mailavathi, um, over issues of like their children and, um divorce, yah. And then, um, subsequently, he told me that he wants to murder her.”[^17]_

Cross-examination of PW1

_“Q:_ _Just in general, in your meetings with Mr. Guna, the both of you spoke about the---the problems he faced with his wife, is that correct?_

_A:_ _Uh, yes._

_…_

_Q:_ _Now, so on 28th February 2018 when both of you were at the void deck, he again shared problems he had at home with his wife and family, right?_

_A:_ _Yes.”[^18]_

EIC of the accused

_“Q:_ _Okay. Now, what did the two of you talk about at the void deck?_

_A:_ _Okay. I---I told her that “After your four---af---after you 4th time meet me---af---let---sorry. I mean, I---from the time I came out the prison, 1st one---1 month, 1 ½ month was okay. And after that, the---everything is start differently already. My children does not respect me. My---son and daughter, they are not listening to me. And my wife also not listening to me. And my daughter sometime go out, does not come back home._

_Q:_ _Okay. So, basically, you were complaining---_

_A:_ _To her._

_Q:_ _to her._

_A:_ _Yes.”[^19]_

_“Q:_ _…So you remember you said you---you want to kill your wife._

_A:_ _Mmm hmm. Because of frus---I feel very frustration._

_Q:_ _Because you felt frustrated?_

_A:_ _Very frustration._

_…_

_Q:_ _Why would you say you want to kill your wife when you are frustrated?_

_A:_ _I was also very angry, the---I feel frustrated. That’s wha---I only say this word. But I don’t have any kind---any intention at all. …I told because I can trust the social welfare that’s well---that’s where I tried to express to her what I feel.”[^20]_

43     The accused had viewed the session with PW1 as an opportunity to vent his frustrations, and saying that he wanted to murder his wife was his way of expressing his anger.

44     In the heat of the moment, the accused had also said that it would be easy to kill his wife either by killing her in her sleep or getting someone to “_finish her off_”. The accused had testified that the reason why he had said all of these things was because:

“_…when I’m angry, when I’m---I just keep saying anything whatever come to my mind_”[^21]

45     It is therefore clear that to the accused, these were merely words that he was spewing out in expressing his anger, to which he gave no considered thought.

## ii.   The accused had uttered all those things because PW1 had assured him that he could speak to her openly

46     Furthermore, the accused had uttered all those words because PW1 had previously assured him that he could speak to her openly, and he felt comfortable with sharing all his problems and feelings with her candidly.

Cross-examination of PW1

_“Q:_ _…it was important to you that Mr. Gunasegaran and his wife Madam Mailavathi were open with you about their problems and feelings in order for you to properly help them._

_A:_ _Yes.”[^22]_

_“Q:_ _… in the meeting in around October 2017 which was the last meeting before the meeting in February 2018._

_A:_ _Yah._

_Q:_ _You had told Mr. Guna expressly that he could speak to you openly if he had any problems in his family._

_A:_ _Yes.”[^23]_

EIC of the accused

_“Q:_ _What else did the social worker talk to you about?_

_A:_ _And she told me, “You can talk to me anything, openly. You can trust me.”[^24]_

## iii.   There was no reason why the accused would have wanted to cause alarm to PW1 as he viewed her as somebody who was there to help and somebody he could trust

47     Although motive is not an element of the offence, ordinarily, the typical criminal intimidation case usually involves some sort of dispute, argument or unhappiness between the accused person and the victim, which would make it easier to infer that the accused person had a guilty intent towards the victim in saying certain threatening words or carrying out acts which could be perceived as threats.

48     However, in the present case, the accused believed that PW1 was someone who was there to help him and someone who would listen to his problems. He trusted her and felt happy that there was someone he could share his problems with.

EIC of the accused

_“Q:_ _Okay. So, what did you understand his ro---Ms. Charisa’s role was? What was she supposed to do with you?_

_…_

_A:_ _Only the 2nd time, the 2nd interview. And then she told me like, “I’m here to help you out regarding your family matter.””[^25]_

_“Q: …in your eyes, what kind of role did you view Ms. Charisa to play in your family’s affairs?_

_A: …I thought she is came here to help me patch up the family, because I trusted her.”[^26]_

_“Q:_ _What else did the social worker talk to you about?_

_A:_ _And she told me, “You can talk to me anything, openly. You can trust me.”_

_…_

_Q:_ _Now, how do you feel when she told you that?_

_A:_ _I thought she somewhere to---she---she’s here to help me out with my family._

_Q:_ _Someone sincere?_

_A:_ _Yah._

_Q:_ _What was your impression of her after this 4th meeting?_

_A:_ _I thought---at least there’s someone uh to listen. There’s a ear for---to---to---for me to---so, that I can share my problem to her, what is the family problems, so that I can share with her. And maybe she can help me or with the family._

_Q:_ _The assurance that she gave to you…that---you know, you could speak openly to her… How did that make you feel…when you heard it?_

_A:_ _I was very happy about it, because she’s---someone is coming forward---to help me.”[^27]_

“Q: _… why do you think it is okay to tell a stranger that you want to kill your wife?_

_A:_ _well, I trusted the social…worker. I trusted her. That’s why I tried to explain to her. I…just explained my…frustration._

_Q:_ _Can you tell the Court why you trust her?_

_A:_ _Because she told me that “Okay. You can trust me. You can speak to me openly.”[^28]_

_“A:_ _…after talking to her, I feel a bit happy. I---that I share something---the burden in me that I share---the one who I can trust, the social worker.”[^29]_

49     The accused’s positive impression of PW1, was not disputed or challenged by the Prosecution and in fact, PW1’s position was also that she was there to assist both parties[^30].

50     It is therefore difficult to fathom, given that the accused viewed PW1 as someone who was there to help him and provide a listening ear, why he would have wanted to cause alarm to PW1.

51     Moreover, because of how the accused felt about and viewed PW1, he did not think he would have caused alarm to PW1 by saying those words.

52     Ultimately, the nature of the relationship and interactions between the accused and PW1 makes it difficult to infer that he had the requisite intention.

Re-Examination of the accused

“A:    …_I did not have any intention to cause alarm, because I see her as a normal person. And she’s---she came forward to help me,_”_[^32]_

## iv.   Anything less than intention will not suffice to find that the accused had the requisite _mens rea_

53     It is pertinent to reiterate at this point that any lesser form of knowledge, including knowledge of the substantial or virtual certainty of a result occurring, will not constitute intention. In the Prosecution’s cross-examination of the accused, it had sought to establish that the accused intended to cause PW1 alarm by saying those words, because he knew that PW1 was a social worker working with him on his use of family violence and was trying to stop him from using family violence in future.

Cross-Examination of the accused

_“Q:_ _… Ms. Charisa has counselled you about your history of using family violence before, correct?_

_A:_ _Yes._

_Q:_ _So you know that she is a worker who is trying to get you to change your ways from using family violence, correct?_

_A:_ _Yes, Ma’am._

_Q:_ _In fact, on more than 1 occasion, she has asked you how you intend to change and what are the plans when you get released from prison, correct?_

_A:_ _Yes, Ma’am._

_Q:_ _So, you know that Ms. Charisa is trying to stop you from using family violence in future, correct?_

_A:_ _Yes, Ma’am._

_Q:_ _So, if you know that and you agree that you said all those things to Ms. Charisa, don’t you agree that you are intending to cause alarm to her by saying those things?_

_A:_ _But, I---why should I cause alarm to hers?_

_Q:_ _No, do you agree or not?_

_A:_ _No.”[^33]_

54     However, it is a leap of logic to conclude that the accused had the intention to cause alarm to PW1 merely because he knew that she was counselling him on his use of family violence. That alone cannot be enough to meet the high threshold of the accused having the _purpose_ of causing PW1 alarm or being _absolutely_ certain that his words would cause PW1 alarm. Even if the accused knew that by saying those words, it was possible that he could cause alarm to PW1, that would not be sufficient, as knowledge of the substantial or virtual certainty of a result occurring will not constitute intention.

55     The Defence submitted that taking into account all the circumstances, it cannot be said that it was the accused’s _purpose_ to cause alarm to PW1 in saying those words or that he was _absolutely_ certain that she would be alarmed.

## v.   Investigations were conducted on the basis of the accused’s intention towards PW3 rather than PW1

56     The Defence also highlighted that the accused was initially arrested for breach of PPO (for which he has been given a discharge amounting to an acquittal), and this criminal intimidation charge towards PW1 was only brought later.

57     IO Rahmuna Abdul Samad (PW2) explained that the breach of PPO charge was brought because the police thought that the accused had caused fear towards PW3[^34], even though there was no uncertainty in the first report made to the police that the words in question were uttered to PW1 and not PW3[^35].

58     Investigations were thus conducted on the basis of the accused’s intentions towards PW3 and PW3 being the victim, rather than the accused’s intentions towards PW1.

Cross-examination of PW2

_“Q:_ _So if I can refer you to the---the statement just on P2. If you look at the 2nd page, the questions were mainly in relation---actually, they were all in relation to Mr Gunasegaran’s relationship with his wife, and his intentions towards his wife, correct?_

_A:_ _Yes._

_Q:_ _And there were no specific questions about Mr. Gunasegaran’s intentions towards the social worker, correct?_

_A:_ _Yes._

_Q:_ _So I put it to you, you can agree or disagree, that the police investigations were primarily focus\[ed\] on whether M\[r\].. Gunasegaran threaten\[ed\] his wife._

_A:_ _Agree._

_Q:_ _And in conducting the investigations, the police believe\[d\] that Mr. Gunasegaran’s wife was the victim?_

_A:_ _I agree.”[^36]_

59     The Defence had submitted that the accused and PW3 shared a dysfunctional relationship with a long history of unhappiness. While it may be easier to infer that the accused would have an intention to cause alarm to PW3, she is not the victim in the present charge against him. It is also not the Prosecution’s case that the accused said those words to PW1intending or knowing that the words would be communicated to PW3. Rather, the named victim in the charge is PW1, and it is submitted that the circumstances as set out above sufficiently raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had the requisite intention vis-à-vis PW1.

60     In light of the foregoing, the Defence submitted that the offence of criminal intimidation has not been made out as the Prosecution has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to cause alarm to PW1.

## My Decision

## The Law and Elements of the Charge

61     The relevant statutory provisions in relation to the current charge are as follows:-

Section 503 of the Penal Code

_Whoever threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation of any one in whom that person is interested, with intent to cause alarm to that person, or to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such threats, commits criminal intimidation._

Section 506 of the Penal Code

_Whoever commits the offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extent to 2 years, or with fine, or with both; and if the threat is to cause death or grievous hurt, or to cause the destruction of any property by fire, or to cause an offence punishable with death or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years or more, or impute unchastity to a woman, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with both._

62     In the present case, the elements that the Prosecution needs to prove are that:

(a)     The accused had threatened injury to a person in whom the victim is interested in; and

(b)     The accused had done so **with intent to cause alarm** to the victim.

## My Assessment of the Evidence

63     Looking at the facts of this case, I note that the accused is not disputing the fact that he had told PW1 that he wanted to murder PW3 by either killing her in her sleep or getting someone to finish her off. As such, the accused is not disputing the fact that he had threatened to cause harm to PW3, PW3 being a person in whom PW1 was interested in.

64     The next question I will need to consider is whether the accused had done so with the intent of causing alarm to PW1. In the present case, the Prosecution is saying that the accused had intended to cause alarm to PW1 and the Defence is saying that there was no intention by the accused to cause alarm to PW1 as he was merely venting his frustrations and expressing his anger to PW1 whom he thought is able to help out with his family issues.

65     I am of the view that we should not look at the just the words which were spoken by the accused in isolation but we should consider the words in the context of the relationship between PW3 and the accused and also the role of PW1 in this relationship.

66     In this context, I note the following:

a.     PW3 and the accused have been married since 1997[^37] and PW3 has been a victim of spousal violence for 20 years[^38]. PW3 had also been issued with a PPO against the accused[^39].

b.     The accused had gone to jail for family violence issues and PW1 was appointed by MSF to help PW3 as a victim of family violence and also to help prepare her for the accused’s discharged from prison. PW1 was also tasked to help the accused who was perpetrator of family violence and to prepare him before he was discharged from prison in October 2017[^40].

c.     It is also clear that after the accused was released from prison, the parties continued to live together.

d.     However PW1 continued to allege that the accused was committing family violence on her[^41] and the accused was accusing PW3 of abusing her PPO against the accused[^42].

e.     Other than the issue of spousal violence, there is also the issue of infidelity by the accused. PW3 had testified that the accused had gotten married to another woman in December 2017[^43] and was trying to force her to divorce him because of the woman[^44].

f.     It is also clear that in addition to his matrimonial issue with PW3, the accused was also having issues with his children. He felt that his daughter had disciplinary issues as she was staying out and not coming home and his children were not respectful of him[^45]. The accused had also obtained a PPO against his son for alleged family violence towards him[^46].

g.     PW1 has been helping both PW3 and the accused to address their matrimonial problems as well as the problems relating to their children[^47] since 2016[^48]. PW1 also acknowledged that she had informed the accused as far back in October 2017 that he could be honest with her and he could share his problems with her[^49].

h.     This is not the 1st time that the accused had “threatened” to kill PW3[^50]. According to PW3, the accused had on numerous previous occasions verbally abused her and threatened to kill her and their daughter when he was triggered by the mention of his girlfriend. The accused had also threatened to murder PW3 and the children during a dispute in January 2018[^51].

i.     I also note that despite the numerous “threats to kill” by the accused, PW3 and the children continued to live with the accused under the same roof.

## Whether the accused intended to cause alarm to PW1

67     The Prosecution’s case is that the accused’s intention can be inferred from:-

a.     The accused’s knowledge of PW1’s role. The accused knows that PW1 was their social worker and he must know with absolute certainty that PW1 would become alarmed by his use of the word “kill”.

b.     The way the accused had threatened to kill PW3 on 23 February 2018. The accused had informed PW1 that he intended to kill PW3. He them emphasized to PW1 that he was serious about it and he even went to elaborate on how he would proceed to kill PW3.

68     The Prosecution was of the view that the manner in which PW1’s conversation played out with the accused must lead to the irresistible inference that the accused’s purpose was to cause PW1 alarm.

69     The Defence’s position is that the accused was merely venting his frustration and anger with his social worker whom he thinks is able to help him with his problems and he did not intend to cause her alarm.

70     The offence of criminal intimidation requires either a person or another in whom he is specifically interested to be threatened. There must be an intent to cause alarm to the former by a threat to him of injury to himself or to the latter. The gist of the offence is the effect which the threat is intended to have upon the mind of the person threatened.

71     I accept the definition of “intention” as stated in Yeo, Morgan and Chan’s _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_ (Revised 2nd Edition) and in _Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan v PP_ that “_intension is a conscious state in which mental faculties are aroused into activity and summoned into action for the purpose of achieving a conceived end. It means shaping of one’s conduct as to bring about a certain event.”_ And “_intention, wherever it appears as a fault element of an offence, should be defined as constituting the accused’s purpose to achieve a result or his or her knowledge that a result was absolutely certain to occur in the ordinary course of events… any lesser form of knowledge, including knowledge of the substantial or virtual certainty of a result occurring will not constitute intention”._

72     I also accept Defence’s submission that in order for the offence of criminal intimidation to be made out, the Prosecution must show that it was the accused’s purpose to cause harm to PW1 or that the accused was absolutely certain that his words would cause alarm to PW1.

73     In the present case, the accused had given evidence that he trusted PW1 as his social worker and he thought that she will be able to help him with his issues with PW1 and his children. This evidence is not contradicted or shown to be untrue by the Prosecution. It is also clear that this is not the 1st time the accused had threatened to “kill” PW3. In fact, from the evidence, which is corroborated by PW3, it is clear that accused has a habit of threatening to kill PW3 and the children whenever he gets angry when there is a quarrel with him and PW3. It is also clear that parties continued to live together despite all these threats. Given these facts, and parties’ background and the fact that PW3 and the accused have been having family and spousal violence issues for more than 20 years and that PW1 had been working with both of them for almost 2 years before the incident on 28 February 2018, I do not agree with that the Prosecution’s view that the accused’s knowledge of PW1’s role and the words used by him of 28 February 2018 must lead to the irresistible inference that the accused’s purpose was to cause PW1 alarm.

74     In the present case, there is a possibility that the accused did trust PW1 to want to vent his anger and frustration about his family issues. It is clear from the evidence that the accused has a habit of shooting off his mouth and threatening to kill PW3 and the children whenever he is angry. It is also clear that PW3 and the children are not very bothered by the accused’s threats as they continued to reside under the same roof. In this case, the accused’s threats to “kill” PW3 is also not something out of the blue as he has been making such threats throughout his marriage with PW3 and they remained married to date.

75     Given this background, and the fact that PW1 had told the accused that he could be honest with her and share all his problems with her, one cannot discount the possibility that the accused was genuinely being honest with PW1 and that he was sharing his problem and venting his frustration to PW1 whom he regarded as his confidante. She was his social worker who was there to help him.

76     At the close of the trial, the burden on the Prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. And the accused is entitled to an acquittal only if the doubts are real or reasonable.

77     In _Public Prosecutor v Liew Kim Choo_ \[1997\] 3 SLR 699, Yong Pung How CJ in quoting Lord Diplock in the leading case of _Haw Tua Tau v PP_ \[1981\] 2 MLJ 49 \[at 57\]:

“57.  As Lord Diplock stated in the leading case of _Haw Tua Tau v PP_ \[1981\] 2 MLJ 49 :

“For reasons that are inherent in the adversarial character of criminal trials under the common law system, it does not place upon the court a positive obligation to make up its mind at that stage of the proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution has by then already satisfied its beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Indeed it would run counter to the concept of what is a fair trial under that system to require the court to do so.”

58.    The prosecution must, at the end of trial, go beyond what it must show as the close of the prosecution’s case. At the close of the prosecution’s case, the prosecution need only raise a prima facie case which, if uncontradicted by the defence, would justify a conviction. That case could be made out of proved facts or reasonable inferences drawn from the proved facts. The nature of the inferences as to the primary facts must be drawn at the close of the prosecution’s case were described by Lord Diplock in _Haw Tua Tau_ as follows:

“for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s 189(1) the court must act on the presumption (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.”

59.    For obvious reasons, in deciding the issue of guilt at the close of the trial, this standard will not suffice. The evidence must be subjected to the highest not lowest standard of scrutiny. The facts proved by the prosecution must therefore satisfy the trial judge beyond reasonable doubt that the correct inference to be drawn from those facts is that the accused person is guilty. The trial judge is not allowed to act on the presumption that the primary evidence is true. Nor is he to make only a minimal assessment – to decide if the necessary inferences “would reasonably be drawn”. He must make a maximum assessment…

60.    I therefore had to consider the evidence afresh, without reference to my conclusions in the first appeal, which conclusions were premises on a different standard of proof”

78     The issue of burden of proof was also considered in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syed Mallik_ \[2007\] SGCA 48 where the Court of Appeal \[ at 34\] commented:

“34    …in relation to the requisite burden of proof, it needs no reminding that the burden lies squarely with the Prosecution to prove the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As Rajah JA said in _Sakthivel Punithavathi_ (\[32\] supra at \[78\]):

Whatever is thought about the myriad objectives of criminal punishment, one fundamental principle has been hailed as a cornerstone both at common law and in the Evidence Act (Cap 97 1997 Rev Ed): before an accused can be convicted of a crime, his guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This bedrock principle is sacrosanct in our criminal justice system and constitutes a fundamental right that the courts in Singapore have consistently emphasised and upheld as a necessary prerequisite for any legitimate and sustainable conviction: see, for example, _Jagatheesan_ \[\[66\] supra\]; … _Took Leng How v PP_ \[2006\] 2 SLR (R) 70.

Indeed, the trial judge also alluded to this important principle in his judgment in respect of the second trial (see _Mohammed Liton (No. 2)_ (\[30\] supra)). At \[4\] of that judgment, he stated that:

Unlike civil cases, where the court may choose between competing stories and accept the one on a balance of probabilities, that is to say, accepting that version because it seemed more plausible than the other, in a criminal case, there is an important norm to be taken into account at all times – that where there is a reasonable doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused. _It is inherent (in) the requirements that the prosecution proves its case beyond reasonable doubt._ \[emphasis added\]

35.    As to what proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” (per Rajah JA in _Sakthivel Punithavathi_ (\[32\] supra) at \[78\] means, we would endorse the definition accepted by him in _Jagatheesan_ 9\[32\] supra at \[55\]), viz, the description **of “reasonable doubt“ as “reasoned doubt” \[emphasis in original \] – which in turn mandates that all doubt, for which there is a reason relatable to and supported by the evidence present, be taken into account in favour of the accused**. Reasonable doubt might also arise by virtue of lack of evidence submitted, if such evidence is necessary to support the Prosecution’s theory of guilt: see _Jagatheesan_ at \[61\]. Indeed, the trial judge also similarly referred to such a meaning of the standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” in his judgment in respect of the second trial (see _Mohammed Liton (No 2)_ (\[30\] supra at \[41\]):

**What this means is that unlike a civil case, the court’s verdict might not merely be determined on the basis that as between two competing stories, which version was the more plausible one. In a criminal case, the court may find … the complainant’s story to be more probable than that of the accused person’s version, and yet, be convinced that there is a reasonable possibility that the accused’s person’s story could be true. If that were the case, the court’s duty is to acquit**. Unlike a civil case, the court need not make a decision by concentrating on which one of the two versions was more probable. In a criminal trial the court must remind itself to break away from any habitual inclination to contemplate the question of the burden of proof on the basis of a civil case, and instead, ask itself whether there is a reasonable possibility that the accused person’s version was true. (emphasis mine)

79     Given the evidence before me and the reasons given above, I am of the view that where there is a reasonable doubt, the doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused. In the present case, there is reasonable doubt as to whether the accused was sharing his problems with PW1 or expressing his intention to harm PW3 in order to cause alarm to PW1. Therefore, in this case, I am of the view that the Prosecution had not proven its case under section 506 of the Penal Code beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused.

## Whether to amend the charge to section 4(1)(a) POHA

## a.   The Prosecution’s Position on Amending the Charge**[^52]**

80     The Prosecution had also invited me to exercise my powers under section 128(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code to amend the charge to one under section 4(1)(a) punishable under section 4(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A) in the event that I am of the view that element of _mens rea_ is not satisfied under section 506 of the Penal Code.

81     Section 4 Cap 256A reads:

**Harassment, alarm or distress**

4.—(1)    No person shall by any means —

(a)    use any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; … **which is heard, seen or otherwise perceived** by any person (referred to for the purposes of this section as the victim) **likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.**

(2)    Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and, subject to section 8, shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.

(3)    In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (2), it is a defence for the accused person to prove —

(b)    that he had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the communication made, by him would be heard, seen or otherwise perceived by the victim; or

(b)    that his conduct was reasonable.

82     The Prosecution had submitted that a section 4 Cap 256A offence does not require the offender to possess _mens rea_ that his words/behaviour would cause harassment/alarm/distress, only that his words/behaviour is _in fact_ likely to do so.

83     The Prosecution also submitted that in a clear case such as a present case, I should exercise my discretion to effect the necessary amendments to a charge so as to fit the proved facts: _PP v Tan Khee Wan Iris_ \[1994\] 3 SLR 214.

## b.   Defence’s Position on Amending the Charge**[^53]**

84     The Defence had highlighted the following points in relation to the amending of the section 506 Penal Code charge to one under section 4(1) under POHA:

i.     Although this Court has the powers to amend the charge at any point before judgment, the power should be exercised liberally and without reference to existing jurisprudence.

ii.     The Court of Appeal in _Mui Jia Jun v PP_ \[2018\] SGCA 59 (“**_Mui Jia Jun_**”) at \[95\] laid down the following guidance for the Prosecution where it is pursuing alternative cases:

a.       The charge should clearly state the various facets of the Prosecution’s case against the accused.

b.       The Prosecution should make clear that it is seeking a conviction of the accused based on any one of the multiple facets of its case. If this cannot be done in the charge, it could be made clear in the opening address at the trial, or in any other method in writing to the accused e.g. in the Case for the Prosecution prior to the trial.

The Defence had pointed out that this was not done in the present case. Therefore, given the fact that the Prosecution is proposing to amend the charge only after closing submissions, this is clearly unfair to the Defence.

iii.     On the issue of whether section 4 POHA requires a _mens rea_ element for the charge to be made out[^54]:-

a.       At the outset, parliamentary intent makes clear that POHA is a statute which collates and penalises harassing conduct[^55]. Particularly, section 4 POHA is the least severe offence contained within POHA, as it carries with it the maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine. The remaining offences carry additional maximum imprisonment terms of between 6 to 12 months at first instance. section 4 POHA is thus the least severe form of harassment that may be committed.

b.       Conversely, section 506 of the Penal Code is intended to punish criminal intimidation. This distinction immediately makes clear that both offences are not of the same genus, with each painting a convicted person with completely different textures – one commits an act of unintended harassment, while the other intended to criminally intimidate. With distinctly different genus, it is submitted that section 4 POHA is not a _simpliciter_ form of section 506 Penal Code, and the Prosecution should be slow to conclude so.

c.       The Defence submitted that an accused may possibly be charged under section 4 POHA if deemed, at a _prima facie_ level, to have committed an unintended act of harassment. However, he is also accorded the statutory defence of reasonable conduct, if he can prove the same. The accused’s explanation of his conduct would necessarily involve a careful assessment of his state of mind at the time of the offending conduct – specifically, his **intention** at the material time. This is a fact-specific assessment, dependent on the unique circumstances of each case.

d.       Section 4(3)(b) POHA provides as follows:

_“In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (2), it is a defence for the accused person to prove… that his conduct was reasonable.”_

e.       This is supported by the High Court’s dicta in _Benber Dayao Yu v Jacter Singh_ \[2017\] 5 SLR 316 at \[43\]. When determining whether the respondent in the case had shown that his conduct was reasonable, the High Court opined as follows:

_“It must be said that_ **_what amounts to reasonable conduct is heavily fact-specific and dependent on the unique circumstances of each case_** _. In responding to question from the members of the House on the Protection from Harassment Bill, Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam outlined some factors that should be considered when determining the reasonableness of conduct (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (13 March 2014) vol 91):_

_… Reasonableness of conduct is a defence to all of the offences under the Bill and the Court will have to consider, inter alia:_ **_the nature of the allegedly offending act in question, the context in which those acts occurred; and the effect of those actions on the victim_** _…”_

f.       Considering the guidelines above, the Defence reiterated that the accused had not caused any alarm to PW1 as he was merely expressing his frustration and anger to PW1 as she had assured him that he could speak to her openly. In determining the reasonableness of the accused’s actions, the Court must necessarily consider his state of mind, including the history of the relationship and interactions between the accused and PW1, the context in which the words were uttered, and also the accused’s proclivity towards speaking excessively to the context.

g.       The Defence concedes that the accused’s actions were unnecessary. However, when considering the specific facts and unique circumstances of this case, the Defence submits that the accused is both able to explain the reasons for his conduct, and also show that his conduct was reasonable.

h.       Simply put, given the offending conduct alleged by the Prosecution and the accused’s explanations for the same, it is difficult for the Prosecution to successfully argue that the accused had acted unreasonably to harass PW1, let alone intended to criminally intimidate her. If the accused had claimed trial to a section 4 POHA charge, the Prosecution would be unable to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

iv.     The Defence also highlighted that the crux of the Prosecution’s prayer to the Court to consider the case on two distinct levels appears to be more appropriately encapsulated under section 141 CPC, which sets out as follows:

_Section 141 –_

(_1_)     _If the charge against a person in respect of any offence consists of several particulars, a combination of only some of which forms a complete lesser offence, and the combination is proved but the remaining particulars are not proved, he may be convicted of the lesser offence although he was not charged with it._

(_2_)     _When a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to a lesser offence, he may be convicted of the lesser offence although he is not charged with it._

v.     Section 141 concludes with two illustrations – where persons originally charged with offences under section 407 and section 325 of the Penal Code, are respectively convicted post-trial on offences under section 406 and section 335 of the Penal Code, when the additional particulars which differentiate the lesser charges from the aggravated charges cannot be proven.

vi.     Given the clear wording and illustrations of section 141, the Prosecution should address the Court on the following issues, if it wishes to persuade the Court to invoke its powers under sections 128 and 141 CPC to convict the accused under section 4 POHA in the event the section 506 charge cannot be proven:

a.       Whether the reference to a “_lesser offence_” in section 141 refers exclusively to the _simpliciter_ form of a more aggravated offence from the same statute (i.e. section 406 from section 407 of Penal Code; section 335 from section 325 of Penal Code, etc);

b.       Whether section 4 POHA can be considered a “_lesser offence_” from section 506 of Penal Code, in the context of section 141 CPC if the two offences are of distinct genus; and

a.       Whether the evidence led in the present trial for the section 506 charge completes the particulars required to prove a section 4 POHA charge.

## c.   My decision on whether to amend the charge

85     Section 128(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code states:

128 – (1) A court may alter a charge or frame a new charge, whether in substitution for or in addition to the existing charge, at any time before judgment is given.

86     I also note the commentaries by the editors of _The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore Annotation and Commentary_ (Academy Publishing 2012 Edition):

“07.052    Section 128, adopted from section 163 of the old CPC, provides that a court may alter a charge or frame a new charge, whether in substitution for or in addition to the existing charge, at any time before judgment is given. The new or altered charge must be read and explained to the accused. As the provision envisions that the power ought to be exercised _before judgment_ is rendered, this provision does not apply to appellate forums; instead, the power of an appellate court to frame an altered charge can be found in section 390(4). This should be distinguished from the position in the old CPC, where, in the light of the conspicuous absence of a provision analogous to section 390(4), an appellate forum would have to seek recourse to section 163 of the old CPC, to amend the charge: see _Lee Ngin Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ \[1993\] 1 SLR (R) 695 at \[42\].

07.053    In practice, when the Prosecution seeks to amend a charge during a trial, the Prosecution will be required to make an application under this section. **_As the Prosecution should maintain the integrity of the prosecutorial process, it cannot successfully maintain that the court has failed in its duty because it did not make an amendment to a charge when the Prosecution did not in any way suggest it and which is predicated upon a legal view of the facts that would have been quite different from that which the Prosecution had put forward throughout the case: see Public Prosecutor v Ishak \[1952\] MLJ 151. However, in a case where it is clear that the end of justice requires that the court amend the charge, the court should do so: see Public Prosecutor v Tan Khee Wan Iris \[1994\] 3 SLR (R) 168 at \[7\] to \[10\]. Further, once the trial court’s attention has been directed to an amendment, it possesses a duty to consider whether its powers to amend the charge should be exercised: see Public Prosecutor v Beh Yew Suan \[1952\] MLJ 225_**_._ \[emphasis mine\]

07.054     **Failure to amend** A failure to amend the charge is an irregularity which can be cured: see _Ramalingam Pillay v The Crown_ \[1905\] IX SSLR 99. However, if the accused was misled by the failure to amend an error in the charge, a re-trial may be ordered: see _Teo Peng Chow v Public Prosecutor_ \[1957\] 1 MLJ 118. On appeal, the appellate court can amend the charge where the trial court had failed to do so and thereafter, remit the case back to the trial court for trial to proceed on the amended charge: see _Public Prosecutor v Tan Khee Wan Isis_ \[1994\] 3 SLR (R) 168 at \[9\] – \[11\].

07.055     **Time of amendment** In _Lew Cheok Hin v R_ \[1956\] MLJ 131, it was held that an amendment to the charge may be made at any stage of the trial though, in general, the earlier the amendment, the better. However, it is at the close of the evidence for the Prosecution that the court is placed in an ideal position to decide exactly what the case the accused is required to meet is. **_In deciding whether an amendment to the charge should be allowed after the close of the case for the defence, the test is whether such an amendment would be prejudicial to the accused: see Public Prosecutor v Salamah binte Abdullah \[1947\] 1 MLJ 178. Where the charge is amended at the close of the case for the Defence by substituting the charge with a more serious charge, this may be held to be unjust to the accused: see Lim Teck Seng v R \[1957\] 1 MLJ 71._** \[emphasis mine\]

87     It is clear from section 128(1) that this court has the powers to alter or to frame a new charge against the accused based on the facts presented at any point before judgment. Although, in most cases, this is done at the close of the Prosecution’s case, there is nothing in law to stop me from doing so even after the close of the Defence’s case.

88     In the case of **_Public Prosecutor v Ishak \[1952\] MLJ 151_**, Whitton J made this comment:

“… a President or a Magistrate has the discretion to amend the charge at any stage of the trial but in addition he is statutorily inquired to consider if it is necessary at the close of the Prosecution case. What precisely is he required to do? He is required to consider the charge recorded against the accused and decide whether it is sufficient and, if necessary, to amend the same. Now if he omits to do this this omission must in some circumstances, in my opinion, constitute a proper ground for reversing his decision. **But I do not think the Prosecution can successfully, maintain a Magistrate has failed in his duty in this matter because he did not make an amendment to the charge which they did not themselves in any way suggest and based on a legal view of the facts quite different from that they themselves have put forward throughout the case**. In my opinion the learned President in the present case complied with the requirements of 173 Criminal Procedure Code, and this ground of appeal must fail.”

89     I note that the Prosecution although they did not formally apply to amend the charge to one under section 4(1), they did draw my attention to the fact that the evidence adduced is sufficient to justify a charge under section 4 POHA in their Closing Submissions.

90     In the case of _Public Prosecutor v Tan Khee Wan Iris_, the respondent was charged for being the licensee of a public entertainment licence and breaching the licensing condition that ‘entertainers should not make any vulgar gestures, actions, or remarks during their performance’ by allowing a performer to cut his pubic hair and expose his buttocks during a performance. The district judge acquitted the respondent as she was of the view that the prosecution had not proved the essential ingredients of the charge against the respondent. In her grounds of decision, the district judge stated that, if there had been any offence committed at all by the respondent, it might be one of providing public entertainment without having a valid licence on 1 January 1994, this being an offence under s 18(1)(_a_) of the Public Entertainments Act. She explained, however, that she had chosen not to amend the charge accordingly because in her view, “The accused had in fact applied for a licence up to 1 January 1994. The mistake, if any, in the issue of the licence lied \[sic\] on the part of the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit”.

91     On appeal by the prosecution, Yong Pung How CJ noted \[at 6\]:

“6    Counsel for the respondent urged this court to uphold the above reasoning, pointing out that the district judge bore no duty as such to amend the charge. Counsel submitted also that the onus lay on the Prosecution in any case to decide what the real complaint against an accused was and to frame the charge or to submit amendments accordingly. In the present case, so counsel claimed, the Prosecution had failed to ask the district judge for an amendment of the charge against the respondent and should not be allowed to argue on appeal that such amendment should have been effected. Two authorities were relied on by counsel: _PP v Heng You Nang_ \[1949\] MLJ 285 and _R v Cheah Teow Peng_ \[1952\] MLJ 216, both judgments of Spenser-Wilkinson J.

7    In both cases, it was stressed that the primary duty in respect of the drawing up of charges was that of the Prosecution’s; and further, that a trial judge was not himself obliged to “_search the law for offences which an accused person may have committed_”. Neither principle is in much dispute, but they really have no direct bearing on the case at hand. **The fact remains that even though the Prosecution in this case did not request an appropriate amendment of the charge, the district judge herself possessed the discretion to effect such amendment once she noted the strong possibility of another offence arising on the facts (an observation which, moreover, she articulated in her written grounds). Indeed, given that the evidence available pointed so obviously to the offence of providing public entertainment without a licence, she should have exercised her discretion so as to amend the charge accordingly, unless the proposed amendment prejudiced the respondent: see** **_R v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Justices, ex parte John Bryce (Contractors) Ltd_** **\[1976\] 2 All ER 611. I must add at this juncture that it seems to me most counsel who cite the above two judgments of Spenser-Wilkinson J patently fail to note that in both instances the learned judge was of the opinion that “****_in a clear case, a president or a magistrate ought to alter a charge to fit the proved facts_****”.**

92     It is clear from the decision of _Public Prosecutor v Tan Khee Wan Iris_ that even if the Prosecution did not apply to amend the charge, **if the evidence adduced clearly point to another offence**, the court should exercise its discretion to amend the charge unless the proposed amendment prejudices the accused.

93     In the present case, since the Prosecution has drawn my attention to section 4 POHA, I will need to look at the evidence adduced and decide if a charge has made out under section 4 and whether I needed to amend the current charge under section 506 Penal Code to section 4 POHA.

## On whether section 4 POHA is applicable to the current facts

94     In the case of _Benber Dayao Yu v Jacter Singh_ \[2017\] 5 SLR 316, See Kee Oon J discussed sections 3 and 4 of the Protection From Harassment Act and made the following comments (at \[21\] to \[24\]):

“21    Section 3 of the POHA provides for the offence of acting with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress to any person by the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or making any threatening, abusive or insulting communication thereby causing harassment, alarm or distress. Under s 3(3), it is a defence for the accused person to prove that his conduct was reasonable.

**22**      **Section 4 of the POHA lays down the offence of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or making any threatening, abusive or insulting communication which is heard, seen or otherwise perceived by any person (“the victim”) likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress. Under s 4(3)(a), it is a defence for the accused person to prove that he had no reason to believe the victim would hear, see or otherwise perceive the word or behaviour used, or the communication made. Similar to s 3(3), s 4(3)(b) also states that it is a defence for the accused person to prove that his conduct was reasonable.**

23     **The difference between the offences in ss 3 and 4 of the POHA is the requirement of intention, which is found in s 3 but absent from s 4** (see Goh Yihan and Yip Man, “The Protection from Harassment Act 2014: Legislative Comment” (2014) 26 SAcLJ 700 at p 710):

The distinction between ss 3 and 4 of \[the POHA\] can seem rather thin. Chee Siok Chin \[v Minister for Home Affairs \[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 582\] highlights two important differences between ss 13A and 13B of the \[Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (“MOA”)\], which will be relevant to understanding ss 3 and 4. First, s 13A (and s 3 \[of the POHA\]), unlike s 13B (and s 4 \[of the POHA\]) does not require the offence to take place within the hearing or sight of any person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress. Secondly, a plain reading of s 13B of the MOA reveals that an intention for the conduct to be ‘threatening, abusive or insulting’ is not even a necessary criterion. It has been said that objectivity is the touch stone for assessing the conduct in question and that threats, abuses and insults embraced by s 13B may constitute an offence whether or not they were so intended. This is likely applicable to s 4 of the \[POHA\]. \[emphasis added\]

24    As stated by the Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, during the second reading of the Protection from Harassment Bill, ss 3 and 4 of the POHA were adapted from s 13A and s 13B of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (“MOA”) with minor changes and modifications so as to extend to words, behaviour or communications made by any means including electronic means as in the present case (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (13 March 2014) vol 91):

Clauses 3 to 6 re-enact and update sections 13A to 13D of the MOA respectively, and therefore, sections 13A to 13D of the MOA will be repealed once this Bill goes through. Thus, clauses 3, 4, 5 and 6, which deal with harassment, in fact are taken from the MOA, with some minor changes. The penalties are increased quite substantively.

… First, the Bill makes clear that harassment and related antisocial behaviour are offences, whether committed in the physical world or online; and that must be so. It must be the consequence of the conduct, not where and how that conduct was carried out, that is important. Clauses 3 to 6 are medium neutral. They extend to words, behaviour or communication used or made by ‘any means’, which will obviously include electronic means.

The second of my five points is that illustrations have been introduced in clauses 3 and 4. These illustrations reiterate and signal that the Bill will cover a wide range of anti-social behaviour, such as: cyber bullying; bullying of children; and sexual harassment. This will be an offence, wherever it takes place, including of course in the workplace.” \[emphasis added\]

95     In order to establish that the accused has committed an offence under section 4(1)(a) of POHA, the Prosecution must first establish that the accused had contravened section 4(1) of the POHA by examining the nature of the words or behaviour in question. If the conduct complained of is found to fall within section 4, the court then proceeds to the second stage to consider whether any defence can apply. At this point, the inquiry is into whether what has been found to be harassing conduct was nonetheless reasonable conduct in the circumstances.

96     See Kee Onn J also made the following comments \[at 31\]:

“31    The terms “abusive”, “insulting”, “threatening”, “harassment”, “alarm”, and “distress” found in ss 3 and 4 are not defined in the POHA. In my judgment, these terms ought to be accorded their common-sense meaning. This is in line with V K Rajah J’s approach in Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs \[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 582 (“Chee Siok Chin”) at \[124\] in considering the absence of definitions for similar terms found in ss 13A and 13B of the MOA:

The fact that Parliament did not define the word ‘harassment’ in ss 13A and 13B of the MOA is a strong indication that this word, like the words ‘insult’ and ‘abusive’, is intended to be accorded a common-sense meaning. Harassment describes determined conduct which is directed at persons and is calculated to produce discomfort and/or unease and/or distress: see Malcomson Nicholas Hugh Bertran v Mehta Naresh Kumar \[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 379. Persistent or prolonged conduct that is directed at causing distress in those responsible for discharging their duties would amount to harassment for the purpose of the subject provisions. The essence of harassment is not just repetitive conduct but includes prolonged or persistent or sustained conduct. \[emphasis in original omitted\]

32    At \[72\] and \[76\] of Chee Siok Chin, the court also held that:

72    … \[I\]n so far as the interpretation of a similar combination of words in the MOA is concerned, it would be correct to conclude that ‘Parliament has given no indication that the word is to be given any unusual meaning. Insulting means insulting and nothing else’. By the same token, the words ‘harassment‘, ‘alarm‘ and ‘distress’ should be given common-sense everyday meanings.

76    … Threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour are simply words or behaviour that are threatening, abusive or insulting in character…

\[High Court’s emphasis in Chee Siok Chin omitted\]

33    The illustration to s 4 of the POHA also offers some guidance as to the type of words that may fall within the ambit of ss 3 and 4 of the POHA:

Illustration

X and Y are classmates. X posts a vulgar tirade against Y on a website accessible to all of their classmates. One of Y’s classmates shows the message on the website to Y, and Y is distressed. X is guilty of an offence under this section. \[emphasis added\]

… Stage 2: reasonable conduct defence

43    Moving to the second stage of the inquiry, this pertained to whether the respondent had shown that his conduct was reasonable. **It must be said that what amounts to reasonable conduct is heavily fact-specific and dependent on the unique circumstances of each case**. In responding to questions from the members of the House on the Protection from Harassment Bill, Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam outlined some factors that should be considered when determining the reasonableness of conduct (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (13 March 2014) vol 91):

… Reasonableness of conduct is a defence to all of the offences under the Bill and the Court will have to consider, inter alia: the nature of the allegedly offending act in question; the context in which those acts occurred; and the effect of those actions on the victim … \[emphasis added\]

I found these factors, namely the nature and context of the offending acts along with their effect on the victim, to be apposite to consider in the present case.

97     In the present case, section 4(1) POHA stipulates that no person shall use any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour which is heard, seen or otherwise perceived by the victim likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress. The harassment must be directed at the victim and calculated to cause discomfort, unease or distress to the victim. In the present case, the words used by the accused are not directed or targeted at PW1. It was directed and targeted at PW3. As such, the so called harassment was not directed at the victim who is PW1.

98     Even if I am wrong on this point and it can be argued that the words can be targeted at PW1, I am of the view that in the present case if the accused is able to prove that he had no reason to believe that the words used could be so perceived by the victim PW1 or that his conduct was reasonable, this would constitute a defence in law under section 4(3) POHA.

99     Based on the evidence before me, I agree with the Defence that given the relationship between PW1 and the accused, and given the fact that PW1 had told the accused that he could be honest with her and share with her his problems and the circumstances under which the words were uttered which is during a routine session with his appointed counsellor, the accused would have no reason to believe that the words told by him to PW1 would be seen or perceived by PW1 as harassment and that his conduct was not unreasonable in the circumstances. As such, even if section 4(1) were to apply, the defence under section 4(3) would be available to the accused.

100    In the present case, I am not convinced that the evidence adduced clearly point to an offence under section 4 POHA. As such, I am not prepared to exercise my discretion under section 128(1) CPC to amend the section 506 Penal Code charge to one under section 4 POHA.

## Whether section 141 CPC is applicable to this case

101    The Defence had submitted that this court should consider the issue of amending the charge with reference to section 141 of the CPC.

102    Section 141 of the CPC states:

“141 – (1)    If the charge against a person in respect of any offence consists of several particulars, a combination of only some of which forms a complete lesser offence, and the combination is proved but the remaining particulars are not proved, he may be convicted of the lesser offence even though he was not charged with it.

(2)    When a person is charged with an offence and the facts are proved which reduces it to a lesser offence, he may be convicted of the lesser offence although he is not charged with it

_Illustrations_

(a)    A is charged under section 407 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) with criminal breach of trust in respect of property entrusted to him as a carrier. It appears he did commit criminal breach of trust in respect of the property under section 406 of the Penal Code in respect of the property but it was not entrusted to him as a carrier. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust under section 406 of the Penal Code.

(b)    A is charged under section 325 of the Penal Code with causing grievous hurt. He proves that he acted on grave and sudden provocation. He may be convicted under section 335 of the Penal Code.

103    I also note the commentaries of the editors in The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore Annotations and Commentary (Academy Publishing 2012 Edition) on section 141:

“07.135    Section 141, derived from sections 175(1) and 175(2) of the old CPC, relates to the conviction of an accused of a lesser offence even though he was not charged with it.

07.136     **Subsection (1)** Subsection (1) was adapted from section 175(1) of the old CPC, which had employed the term “minor offence” as opposed to that of “lesser offence”. Such variation in nomenclature is not intended to result in any substantive variation in the law.

07.137    For the powers of the court under this provision to be engaged, the lesser offence of which the accused is convicted must be one which is necessarily included in the offence originally charged : see _Kundan Singh v Public Prosecutor_ \[1939\] MLJ 27. The principle is enunciated in _Mallal’s Criminal Procedure_ (Butterworth Asia, 6th Ed. 2001) at para 6229 in the following fashion:

\[W\]here an offence consists of several particulars, a combination of some only of which constitutes a complete \[lesser\] offence, the graver charge gives notice to the accused of all the circumstances going to constitute the \[lesser\] offence of which he may be convicted. The latter is arrived at by mere subtraction from the former. But when the circumstances constituting the major charge do not, necessarily and according to the definition of the offence imputed by that charge, constitute the \[lesser\] offence also, the principle no longer applies, because notice of the former does not necessarily involve notice of all that constitutes the latter”

104    From the above, it would seem to me that section 141 can only apply if the lesser offence of which the accused is convicted is one which is necessarily included in the offence originally charged.

105    In the present case, section 4 POHA is not a lesser offence of section 506 Penal Code, it is a completely different offence which is targeted at a different mischief. As such, section 141 of the CPC would not be applicable in this instance.

## On the case of _Mui Jia Jun_

106    As for the case of **_Mui Jia Jun_**, I agree with the Prosecution that this case pertains to an entirely different fact scenario not analogous in any way to the present case. **_Mui Jia Jun_** concerned the Prosecution running alternative factual case theories to prove the same charges, and not having explicitly stated so such that there appeared to be doubt on the Defence’s part on how exactly the Prosecution intended to prove the charges. In the present case, the Prosecution’s case has always been that the accused intended to cause the victim alarm. This has been stated in the charge all along. It was abundantly clear to parties that the sole issue in dispute was whether this intention was present. There was never any confusion on the case theory the Prosecution intended to run.

## My Orders
