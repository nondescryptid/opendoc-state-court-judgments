Tort – negligence – contributory negligence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 6/2020/01 and DCA 7/2020/01.\]

12 May 2020

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff met with an accident on 27 September 2014. At the material time, the plaintiff (“Ong”) was a pedestrian, intending to cross Whampoa Drive. The defendant (“Yee”) was driving vehicle registration number EN 9700X (“Yee’s Car”), and there was a collision involving Ong and Yee’s Car at about 11.25 am on that date. Ong and Yee were familiar with that location, as they both resided nearby.

2       Ong commenced this action against Yee for damages suffered as a result of this collision. Ong had suffered very serious personal injuries. The trial before me was to decide the issue of liability only.

3       After hearing all the evidence and having considered the closing submissions of the parties, I found that whilst Yee had been negligent in the driving of Yee’s Car, Ong had also been contributorily negligent leading up to the collision. I thus found that the damages to be awarded to Ong should be reduced by 40 %. Therefore, interlocutory judgment was entered in favour of Ong, for 60% of damages to be assessed by the Registrar. Costs and interest were reserved to the Registrar hearing the assessment of damages. Yee and Ong filed separate appeals against this decision.

## A short description of the accident site

4       Whampoa Drive, at the site of the accident, is a dual carriageway with a single lane on each side. There is a concrete centre divider, separating the lanes. Ong had been walking on a pathway from Block 29 Jalan Bahagia and leading to Whampoa Drive. A gap in the centre divider seemingly allows pedestrians to traverse across the two lanes of Whampoa Drive, to reach the opposite side of the road.

5       Ong had intended to cross Whampoa Drive to the other side of the road. If one stands at the kerb of the road where Ong would have been just before entering the road, vehicular traffic would be approaching from one’s right along Whampoa Drive. That part of the road is relatively straight and vehicles would have just negotiated a right bend before coming onto a straight portion of the road.

6       It was not in dispute that the collision had occurred after Yee had negotiated the said right bend and was on the straight portion of the road. Ong had just stepped off from the kerb and there was a collision involving Ong and Yee’s Car. Yee would have been approaching Ong from Ong’s right, and Ong would have been attempting to cross the road from left to right from Yee’s perspective.

7       Each blamed the other for the collision. In the main, each claimed that the other party had failed to keep a proper lookout, and had failed to appreciate the proximal presence of the other. Yee, through his solicitors, had prayed for Ong’s claim to be totally dismissed. Yee claimed that Ong could not be sighted where he stood and had dashed onto the road, giving Yee no time to react and avoid the accident. Ong, through his solicitors, conceded that if at all, any contributory negligence was to be ascribed to Ong, that Ong was entitled to interlocutory judgment for 80% of damages to be assessed.

## Ong’s evidence

8       In his affidavit of evidence in chief (“AEIC”), Ong had said that he had “checked to make sure that Whampoa Drive was clear and safe to cross”, before he stepped off the kerb. It was then that Yee’s Car collided into him. Ong concedes that after the collision, he could not recall what had happened after that.

9       Ong had suffered very serious injuries as a result of the collision. In a Memo from Tan Tock Seng Hospital dated 26 January 2015, Dr Samantha Yap had certified that Ong was medically fit to be interviewed by the police. Dr Yap then pointed out that “due to his traumatic brain injury, he is unlikely to have recollections of the events surrounding the accident as he was in post traumatic amnesia until 17 November 2014”.

10     In a psychological report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital dated 5 January 2016, Ms Serena Ho, a psychologist, reported that the duration of this post traumatic amnesia was for a period of 51 days. In a specialist medical report from Paul W. Ngui Psychiatric Clinic dated 30 September 2016, Dr Francis Ngui, a senior consultant psychiatrist, reported that Ong “had no memory whatsoever of the … accident”. The said Memo and the two said reports are exhibited in Ong’s AEIC.

11     At trial, Ong conceded that his evidence that he had checked that the road was safe to cross was based on his usual practice traversing that road. Hence there was no direct evidence, on Ong’s part, that he had indeed, on the material date, conducted a proper safety check before attempting to cross Whampoa Drive.

12     Therefore, the analysis of Ong’s case had to be carefully considered. Ong called three other witnesses of fact: his mother (PW3), his sister (PW5) and his brother-in-law (PW4) (collectively, “Ong’s family members”). Ong also called an expert witness, PW2, to give a supportive case theory.

## The evidence of Ong’s family members

13     Ong’s family members did not directly witness the collision. What they had witnessed was the aftermath of the collision. This was a crucial consideration when one comes to the analysis as to who, between Ong and Yee, had been liable (or, more liable) for the collision.

14     One point of contention between the parties that had perhaps occupied more time than the resultant probative value gathered, was the issue of the “Stern Warning” that the police had administered to Ong, in relation to the accident. Yee had relied on this, and also on the fact that the police had not taken any action against himself (Yee).

15     Ong’s family members had given supportive evidence on this point for Ong. It appeared that the police had issued this “Stern Warning” without ever having interviewed Ong, to first elicit his version of events.

16     This point can be left as it is. The fact that no action was taken against Yee for the accident, was, in the circumstances, neutral at best. Such action would be in the nature of criminal prosecution, and there was no evidence to suggest why this decision had been taken by the police. As for the “Stern Warning” against Ong, that did not amount to any prosecution as such; in any event, I accepted that Ong was never given the opportunity to state his version of what had happened.

17     The evidence of Ong’s family members was however crucial in one aspect: and that related to the position of Ong after the collision, which may suggest the trajectory of his body caused by the collision. This is a point to which we shall return.

## The evidence of Ong’s expert

18     Ong had called Melvin Lum Kah Whye (PW2) as his expert witness. In his report, annexed to his AEIC, PW2 made four conclusions, the majority of which, at first blush, were supportive of Ong’s case. PW2 had inter alia, in the course of his investigation, visited the accident location on 6 and 10 March 2018, and interviewed Ong and Ong’s sister (PW5). One crucial factor in the report of PW2 was the Point of Rest of Ong after the collision. PW2 based this positioning on the input from PW5, based on her recollection.

19     The four conclusions made in the report of PW2 were, first, PW2 opined that Yee’s speed “at the material time” was “more likely than not”, 32 kmh.

20     Second, PW2 opined that Yee “had a clear line of sight” to Ong “for a minimum of 1.8 seconds and a maximum of 2.2 seconds”, and further opined that “(Yee) did not see (Ong) until it was too late, or that (Yee) did not see (Ong) before the collision”.

21     Third, PW2 opined that it “would appear that (Yee) had been inattentive during the material time”, and that had Yee “been attentive, there would not be any collision”.

22     The 4th conclusion that PW2 arrived at concerned the independent eye witness that Yee called to give evidence (DW1). We will deal with the evidence of DW1 in more detail later. For present purposes, it would suffice to state that the evidence of DW1 was that he (DW1) saw Ong dash across and that Ong was using his handphone at that time. PW2, in his 4th conclusion, opined that “(DW1) did not have a clear line of sight to (Ong) and therefore he would not have seen if (Ong) was dashing nor if (Ong) was using his handphone”.

## Yee’s evidence

23     In his AEIC, Yee said that the width of each lane along Whampoa Drive “(allowed) only one motor car to travel in it only”. Yee describes that part of Whampoa Drive as “a straight road of about 30 (metres) leading into a sharp bend which then straightens out after about 25 (metres) heading towards Jalan Bahagia”.

24     Yee also stated that there were “tall shrubs lined along the left side of Whampoa Drive towards Jalan Bahagia”. These shrubs (material to our analysis) would be to Yee’s left as he drove down Whampoa Drive at the material time.

25     Yee said that he had been travelling at about 35 kmh behind an unknown vehicle. He then approached the said right bend. He slowed down to about 30 kmh and negotiated the right turn.

26     Yee then stated that after completing his right turn across the said bend and “onto the straight portion of Whampoa Drive, (Ong) suddenly appeared from behind a tall shrub and stepped out from the road kerb on my left into my lane/path of travel”. The collision then occurred.

27     In his police report lodged on the same date as the accident, Yee simply stated that as he was driving along Whampoa Drive, “one man suddenly crossed the road from my left hand side. I was not able to stop my vehicle on time and hit the man.”

28     In a subsequent statement made (on or about 8 October 2014) to Ajax Adjusters and Surveyors (“Ajax”), Yee provided more detail. The material portions of this statement read as follows: “At that time, after negotiating a right bend, suddenly, a pedestrian who was crossing the road from my left to right came into my view and landed onto the front of my windscreen.”, and “Upon impact, I applied emergency brake while the pedestrian fell and landed onto the left side of the road behind my vehicle.”

29     Further in the statement to Ajax, Yee describes his encounter with DW1 at the scene. DW1 was said to be the driver of a car who was driving behind Yee at the material time. DW1 had “advised (Yee) that he (DW1) could be (Yee’s) witness and advised that the Pedestrian (Ong) was crossing the road and possibly using his phone while crossing.”

## Evidence of DW1

30     DW1 affirmed his AEIC on 26 June 2018 and stated that he had witnessed the accident involving Ong and Yee’s Car on 27 September 2014. DW1 stated that he was not acquainted with Yee and had no interest in these proceedings or its outcome. DW1 annexed a copy of a Statutory Declaration (“SD”) he made on 17 March 2017.

31     The material portions of the SD of DW1 stated that at the material time, he was driving around the said right bend along Whampoa Drive towards Jalan Bahagia at about 40 kmh, and was behind Yee’s Car at that time. Yee’s Car was about 10 metres ahead.

32     As DW1 approached the end of the said bend and “onto the straight portion of Whampoa Drive”, he saw a pedestrian (Ong) “suddenly dashed onto the road from the kerb on the left side of the road and collided into (Yee’s Car). The accident occurred very close to the road kerb.”

33     DW1 also stated that he “noticed that (Ong) was using his handphone at the material time and he was not looking at the direction of where (Yee’s Car) was travelling when he (Ong) stepped forward into the path of (Yee’s) oncoming motor vehicle.” In the aftermath of the collision, DW1 offered assistance to Yee and described it thus: “As I had witnessed the accident, I told (Yee) what I saw and gave him my contact number in case he needed a witness.”

## The evidence of Yee’s expert

34     Yee called David James Hunter (DW3) as an expert witness. DW3 is a senior consultant of H2 Technical Services. DW3 affirmed his AEIC on 26 July 2018, annexing his report.

35     For the preparation of his report, DW3 visited the accident scene on 3 May 2018, and had spoken to Yee at the scene.

36     In the preparation of his report, DW3 appears to have concluded certain crucial facts based on the recollection of Yee. The approximate position of Ong on the road after the collision (the “point of rest”) was based on what Yee could recollect. (DW3 does qualify this by stating that he had “no precise details” on the final resting position of Ong after the collision.)

37     DW3 also appeared to accept, based on Yee’s recollection, that the hedge (earlier described as the shrubs in Yee’s AEIC) at the time of the collision, was five feet in height. No corroborative evidence as to whether the shrubs were indeed five feet tall at the material time was produced at trial. This was a crucial factor in the determination of liability in this case.

38     DW3 exhibited photographs taken in 2018, which showed signs disallowing pedestrians from crossing Whampoa Drive. However, DW3 appears to have misread these signs, as the prohibition arrows point away from the area where Ong had attempted to cross Whampoa Drive. These signs did not prohibit the crossing of Whampoa Drive at the point where Ong stood, just prior to the collision. DW3 stated further that “we are not sure if this signage was in place at the time of the collision”.

39     Under that part of his report headed “Conclusion”, DW3 makes certain statements. The material statements are set out here. DW3 stated that Yee had “no recollection of seeing (Ong) and appears to have reacted to the contact rather than a definite sighting of (Ong) before the collision occurred”.

40     DW3 stated that there was support for the assertion that the estimated speed that Yee was travelling at was within the speed limit for the road. DW 3 had estimated the speed Yee was travelling at, to be approximately 30 to 35 kmh.

41     As to why the police had chosen not to take any action against Yee for the accident, DW3 commented that it “would be reasonable to make the assumption they (the police) were not satisfied (Yee) could be proven to be at fault in the collision circumstances”. DW3 stated this, despite recognising that “(precisely) why the Police have chosen to take no action is something only they can comment on”. DW3 failed to acknowledge the distinction between a criminal prosecution for a possible road traffic breach, and the civil issue of tortious liability and the many differences between the two, not least of which is the standard of proof required.

42     DW3 stated that despite not having precise data such as the exact point of impact and the final resting place (of Ong), DW3 opined that “(what) we can say is that the average speed would have been approximately 32 (kmh) and that it appears (Yee) had very little reaction time”.

43     DW3 categorically stated that it was his “opinion that (Yee) is in no way responsible for being the cause of this collision”, citing Yee’s driving within the speed limit and “due to the poor maintenance of the hedge” giving Yee “a restricted view of the crossing point”.

44     DW3 further cited what DW1 had said, and concluded that “the primary cause of the collision is the negligence of (Ong) for failing to exercise due care before crossing the road”.

45     DW3 repeated his reference to the hedge when he further stated, “The circumstances were somewhat exasperated by the poor maintenance of the hedge row at a height that would have afforded both (Ong) a view to his right and (Yee) some view of (Ong) prior to his attempt to cross.”

## Distilling the crucial and material issues to be tried

46     The crucial and material issues to be tried that would lead to a determination of the respective liability levels of the parties in this action had to be carefully sieved from the several raised by the parties at trial and in their respective submissions.

47     The most important issue would be whether Ong and Yee had kept a proper lookout from their respective points of view. Yee, through his solicitors, made the point that he had the right of way as the place where Ong had attempted to cross the road was not a designated pedestrian crossing. Having the right of way did not however absolve Yee from having to keep a proper lookout in preparation of any foreseeable danger that may arise.

48     What was the speed Yee was travelling at, just prior to the collision? It was insufficient for a motorist to simply keep within the speed limit. A motorist has the obligation to regulate his speed according to the conditions of the road, bearing in mind that he has to keep a proper lookout for any foreseeable dangers or obstacles.

49     What can be concluded about the way Ong had stepped out onto the road? Had he ascertained whether it was indeed safe for him to cross at that time and at that spot? Had Ong been inattentive?

50     What was the state of the vegetation (the shrubs or the hedge)? Was it maintained in a way which hindered the full and unobstructed view from both the pedestrian’s and the motorist’s viewpoints?

51     Did Yee notice the presence of Ong? If he had not, could he, with proper road discipline, have noticed Ong?

52     Did Ong enter the road too suddenly for Yee to react in time? This is related to issues above such as whether Yee and Ong had maintained their respective proper lookout disciplines as they should.

## Turning points arising from the oral evidence heard at trial

53     We have already seen that Ong’s memory of what had happened was probably severely affected by the prolonged bout of post-traumatic amnesia suffered as a result of the collision. It would therefore be unsafe to rely solely on his evidence to conclude that he had indeed ascertained that it was safe to cross when he did so.

54     With regard to the evidence of Ong’s family members, we have seen that they had not witnessed the collision itself. It was unclear how soon after the collision it was when the family members first saw Ong on the ground. Their view of the aftermath did not lead to a firm conclusion of where exactly Ong had landed after the collision. In her AEIC, PW3 (Ong’s mother) said that “(Ong’s) body was moving about”. Ong’s sister (PW5) described seeing Ong “grimacing and writhing in pain”. Ong may well have moved from the position on the ground that he was just after the collision. As the experts had relied on Ong’s approximate position, some of their conclusions would have to be treated with caution.

55     Yee made one crucial concession during cross examination. When Ong’s Counsel put to him that he had only seen Ong when Ong landed on Yee’s Car and “not before that”, Yee agreed. This contradicted what Yee had said in his AEIC, that Ong had “suddenly appeared from behind a tall shrub and stepped out from the road kerb”, as Yee had actually not seen Ong before Ong landed on Yee’s Car. Yee could not therefore directly give evidence of Ong’s actions just prior to the collision.

56     Further, Yee could not have had direct knowledge of what he had stated in his police report, that “one man suddenly crossed the road from my left hand side”.

57     With regard to his statement to Ajax, Yee did not have direct knowledge to have been justified to state that “a pedestrian who was crossing the road from my left to right came into my view and landed onto the front of my windscreen”. The truth of the matter was that Ong had not “(come) into (Yee’s) view” as Yee did not see Ong till Ong had landed on Yee’s Car.

58     Therefore, Yee could not give direct evidence as to how Ong had entered the road. Certainly, Yee was not in a position to positively state that Ong had dashed onto the road.

59     We now turn to the testimony of DW1, who gave evidence that Ong had “suddenly dashed” onto the road, and that Ong had been using his handphone and was inattentive. During cross examination, DW1 modified his version of how Ong had stepped out onto the road. Whilst the use of the words “suddenly dashed” is suggestive of someone recklessly running onto the road, DW1 clarified that Ong had moved out onto the road at a “moderate pace”.

## Issues surrounding the Conclusions reached by PW2 (Ong’s expert)

60     Both experts (PW2 and DW3) came to the same conclusion regarding Yee’s speed at the material time. Both experts approximate the speed at around 32 kmh. Driving at a speed below the speed limit does not, of its own, absolve a driver from possible liability. A driver has to moderate his speed according to the road conditions. The area of the accident site was residential, and Yee would have known that there was a likelihood that there would be pedestrians in the vicinity, who might attempt to cross the road.

61     PW2 had concluded that Yee “had a clear line of sight to (Ong) for a minimum of 1.8 seconds and a maximum of 2.2 seconds. However, (Yee) did not see (Ong) until it was too late, or that (Yee) did not see (Ong) before the collision.” This conclusion leads to another inevitable conclusion which was left unsaid by PW2: if Yee had a clear line of sight to Ong, the reverse must also be true. Ong would clearly have been able to see Yee’s Car, if he had looked towards his right from where Yee was approaching.

62     Next, PW2 had concluded that it “would appear that (Yee) had been inattentive during the material time. Had (Yee) been attentive, there would not be any collision.” Again this would lead to the inevitable conclusion, again unsaid by PW2, that this theory suggests then that Ong had also been inattentive. For, how would Ong not have appreciated the presence of Yee’s Car (whilst not travelling at a fast speed, was certainly not proceeding at a snail’s pace either) and judged that it would have been unsafe to cross?

63     Finally, PW2 said that DW1 “did not have a clear line of sight to (Ong) and therefore he would not have seen if (Ong) was dashing nor if (Ong) was using his handphone”. I was not satisfied with the methodology employed by PW2 to come to this conclusion. As the exact positions of Yee’s Car, the car driven by DW1 and Ong could not be ascertained with precision, the various permutations of the positioning had to be considered. This did not appear to have been done thoroughly. I thus entertained doubt regarding this particular conclusion made by PW2.

## Issues surrounding the Conclusions reached by DW3 (Yee’s expert)

64     DW3 had stated that Yee had “no recollection of seeing (Ong) and appears to have reacted to the contact rather than a definite sighting of (Ong) before the collision occurred”. This is borne out by Yee’s concession that he had first seen Ong just after the collision had occurred.

65     DW3 came to a similar conclusion as PW2 did, as to the approximate probable speed of Yee’s Car at the material time, being around 32 kmh.

66     DW3 concluded that Ong was wholly to blame for the accident as Ong had failed to “exercise due care” before crossing the road.

67     DW3 relied much on the alleged state of the hedge at the material time. DW3 appeared to accept Yee’s recollection that the hedge was five feet tall at the material time. No corroboration of this was obtained, for example, there could well have been records of the maintenance of the hedge at the relevant time, together with the approximate height of the hedge. In any event, even if we were to accept that the hedge was indeed five feet in height at the material time, it would be pertinent to point out that Ong is 1.81 metres tall. The approximate equivalent of 1.81 metres is five feet 11.26 inches. Ong is almost six feet tall, and would have been visible despite a hedge height of five feet.

68     From a consideration of the evidence of DW1, Ong had not started a run from a distance behind the hedge (from which his sudden appearance may have been unexpected) but had been on the kerb and had stepped off from the kerb onto the road at a “moderate pace”. There would have been sufficient time, in the circumstances, for Yee to have noticed Ong and Ong’s intended action. The evidence suggests that Yee had not been looking in Ong’s direction at all.

## The findings

69     A consideration of all the evidence leads to the conclusion that both Ong and Yee had been inattentive and had both failed to keep a proper lookout. At a speed of around 32 kmh, had Ong been paying proper attention, he would have appreciated the close proximity of Yee’s Car moving towards him. Yee had admitted that he had not seen Ong till just after the collision itself occurred. The evidence showed that had Yee been keeping a proper lookout, he would have seen Ong in good time. Another factor that buttresses this particular finding that both parties had not been paying attention was the lack of evasive action taken immediately just before the collision, or at least the appreciation that a collision was about to occur. The circumstances simply could not support a theory that either Yee’s Car or Ong had suddenly (from the opposing party’s view) appeared. There was sufficient time for either to have seen the other, had proper care and attention been taken and observed. Yee did not react in time, simply because he had failed to notice Ong, in circumstances where he ought to have.

70     Both the experts suggest that Yee’s Car was travelling at around 32 kmh. It was insufficient to simply and solely keep within the speed limit. Yee ought to have recognised that in a residential area, he had to expect that pedestrians may attempt to cross, and he had to be alert to this highly foreseeable possibility.

71     If Yee had a clear line of sight to Ong, it would obviously also mean that Ong would have been able to see Yee’s Car with clarity. I did not need to dwell too much on the issue of whether or not Ong had been using his handphone, and if so, how he had been using it. The issue was more, whether or not Ong had been inattentive. The evidence very strongly suggests that Ong had been inattentive. On a balance of probabilities, this could be the only explanation for his action, in the circumstances. Ong had not ascertained that it was indeed safe to step off the kerb onto the road.

72     As to the state of the hedge, I found that it was not in a state that would have hindered the vision for either Yee or Ong, in this case. Ong is a tall man, and would have been quite visible to Yee and Ong would have had no problem seeing the approach of Yee’s Car.

73     Had Ong and Yee been paying attention and keeping a proper lookout, they would each have noticed the presence of the other, in good time. On a balance of probabilities, I rejected the assertion that Ong had appeared so suddenly so as to afford Yee insufficient time to react. As the evidence strongly suggested, Yee’s attention was not on that part of the road that Ong was on.

74     After a careful consideration of all the evidence, I came to the findings set out above, on a balance of probabilities. It would thus be seen that whilst Yee had been negligent, Ong had been contributorily negligent.

75     Ong’s solicitors relied on a particular scenario in the Motor Accident Guide (“MAG”), where a vehicle was moving straight, and a pedestrian was crossing a road, more than 50 metres away from a pedestrian crossing. This scenario approximated the situation in this case. In suggesting that in such a scenario, the vehicle should bear liability to the extent of 70% and the pedestrian should bear liability to the extent of 30%, the MAG states as a reason, “The pedestrian may choose to cross the road at any point he chooses, so long as he takes reasonable care for his own safety.” The MAG adds, as a note, “Factors that will shift liability in favour of the driver include: the pedestrian did not keep a proper lookout for oncoming traffic; the pedestrian dashes across the road suddenly; the pedestrian had notice of the vehicle but proceeded regardless.”

76     In arguing that Yee’s liability was “at least 80%”, Ong’s solicitors state that Ong had crossed at a point more than 50 metres away from a pedestrian crossing; and that Ong’s liability should be reduced as Ong had not dashed across, and was fully visible when Yee was 20.3 metres away from the point of impact (based on the report from PW2).

77     Whilst it was my finding that Ong had not “dashed across”, it was also my finding that Ong had failed to keep a proper lookout for oncoming traffic. Therefore it could not be maintained that Yee was 80% liable or even 70% liable (as suggested as a baseline in the scenario cited). Yee’s liability would have to be lower than the 70% suggested starting point. In deciding the level at which Yee was to be held liable, I took into account that Yee himself had failed to keep a proper lookout and ought to have seen Ong in good time to either warn Ong of his approach, slowed down further, or take evasive action to avoid the collision. Having considered all relevant factors, I found that Yee was liable to the extent of 60%. Ong had been contributorily negligent, and the damages to be awarded to him would be thus reduced by 40%.

## Conclusion

78     Therefore, interlocutory judgment was entered in favour of Ong against Yee, for Ong to receive 60% of the damages assessed at the assessment of damages by the Registrar. Costs and interest were reserved to the assessment. Both Yee and Ong have filed separate appeals against this decision.
