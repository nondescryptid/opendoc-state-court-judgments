Tort – Negligence – Breach of duty

Evidence – Burden of proof

31 August 2022

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       In the early hours of 3 April 2015, a fire broke out at the second storey of a private apartment building at 86A Lorong 6 Geylang, Singapore 399237 (“the Premises”). The Premises had been used as an improvised dormitory for migrant workers at the material time.

2       While the majority of the occupants managed to escape unscathed, two of the workers were found lying motionless in one of the rooms in the Premises and subsequently pronounced dead by personnel of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”). They were Bangladeshi nationals named Mamun Abdullah All (“the Deceased”) and Hosen Ali. Both were certified to have died from smoke inhalation as disclosed in the autopsy reports.

3       The plaintiff is the father and the administrator of the Deceased’s estate. He brings this claim on behalf of the estate as well as for himself and his wife, Jahanara Begum, being dependants of the Deceased. The Deceased was 20 years old at the time of his death and had been employed as a construction worker in Singapore from around January 2015[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1).

## Background

4       The first to the fourth defendants are the joint owners and landlords of the Premises[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). They had purchased the Premises in their joint names as an investment property in 2010[^3].

5       The second defendant was the late wife of the first defendant. She passed away on 30 November 2016 and the first defendant was appointed the sole administrator of her estate in March 2018[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). The third and fourth defendants are also a husband and wife. They are related to the first couple by marriage – the son of the first and second defendants is married to the daughter of the third and fourth defendants[^5].

6       The duties in the management of the investment property were divided up among the four defendants. The financial aspects such as signing of the tenancy agreements, renewals and collection of rentals were handled by the first defendant. The third defendant was in charge of the maintenance and inspections[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) of the Premises when required while the fourth defendant attended to the insurance matters[^7].

7       On 18 September 2014, a tenancy agreement for the Premises was signed by the first defendant as landlord with a company called HKH Construction Pte Ltd as tenant for the period from 5 October 2014 to 4 October 2015 (“Tenancy Agreement”). One Mr Ho Kien Heng had signed on behalf of the named tenant[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8).

8       The Tenancy Agreement provided for a combined rental of $5,600 per month for the Premises on an unfurnished basis[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9). As part of the tenant’s covenants, the Tenancy Agreement prohibited the tenant from assigning, subletting or parting with possession of the Premises or any part thereof. It was also stipulated in the Tenancy Agreement that the Premises shall not be occupied by more than eight persons[^10].

9       The investigations conducted by the police after the fire, however, revealed that Mr Ho Kien Heng had difficulties paying the contracted rental[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) and he had assigned the tenancy of the Premises to the fifth defendant, Neo Wee Seng, in December 2014[^12].

10     The fifth defendant who was apparently the director of a company called Sim Hua Pte Ltd in turn rented the Premises to foreign workers who were introduced to him by his friend, one Jahir Raihan Billal Hossain _aka_ Johid, a Bangladeshi national and a work permit holder. The fifth defendant had entrusted Johid to manage the Premises and collected a base rent of $7,000 per month from Johid. The fifth defendant had visited the Premises in February 2015 and was aware that the Premises had taken the form of an improvised dormitory with 12 rooms[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13). Johid had reportedly collected rentals of $250 to $300 each from the workers who resided at the improvised dormitory. It was noted in the Coroner’s Certificate that Johid had left Singapore for Bangladesh soon after the fire and could not be contacted[^14].

11     The sixth defendant is a construction company and was the named employer of the Deceased at the material time. The sixth defendant’s manager, one Thanapalan Vijayan, had arranged with Johid for the Deceased and four other workers employed by them to be housed at the Premises on or around 31 March 2015[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15).

12     While it appears from the record that the writ had been served on both the fifth and sixth defendants, neither of them entered an appearance. They did not participate in the proceedings and no default judgment has been entered against them to-date. The trial of the plaintiff’s action on the issue of liability thus proceeded against the first to the fourth defendants only. For convenience, they shall be referred to herein as “the Four Defendants”.

## The cause of the fire

13     Investigations into the cause of the fire were conducted by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) together with the Singapore Police Force and documented in a Fire Investigation Report dated 17 September 2015[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16).

14     Andy Choo Liew Kuan, the leader of the SCDF’s Fire Investigation team tasked to investigate the incident and who had approved the contents of the Fire Investigation Report, was subpoenaed as a witness for the plaintiff (“PW3”). The significant findings noted in the Fire Investigation Report were as follows:

> (a)     There were 12 partitioned rooms in the affected unit, _ie_ the Premises, which were identified as Rooms 1 to 12 in the Report.

> (b)     The Premises were not equipped with any fire protection system.

> (c)     The origin of the fire was found to be in Room 8 where the fire damage was noted to be more severe compared to the passageway and other parts of the Premises.

> (d)     Burn patterns were consistent with that of a fire that originated from the area between a three-tier metal drawer and underneath the lower deck of a double-decker bed in Room 8.

> (e)     Burnt marks were seen on the floor of Room 8 where remnants of a portable socket outlet and other electrical devices were found at the area where the fire is believed to have originated.

> (f)     It was observed that “daisy-chaining” (_ie_ connecting portable socket outlets to other portable socket outlets) was widely practised within the Premises. Many electrical appliances (such as refrigerators, televisions, rice cookers, kettles, mobile phone chargers) were seen connected to multi-way adaptors throughout the Premises.

> (g)     Room 9, where the two deceased victims were found, was situated next to Room 8 where the fire originated. Smoke and combustion gases from the development of the fire were able to enter Room 9 through gaps in the partition walls and fixtures. This was evident from the soot stains observed at the gaps, walls and ceilings.

> (h)     The inhalation of smoke and other combustion gases would have rendered the two occupants in Room 9 unconscious, and following that, death.

> (i)     The most probable cause of the fire was accidental and of electrical origin. Heat from energised wirings / connections at the portable socket outlet had provided the ignition source with the ignition fuel being the portable socket outlet and combustibles in the area. These included a burnt suitcase that had contained clothing.

## Coroner’s finding

15     The Fire Investigation Report had been relied on extensively in the Coroner’s Inquiry into the deaths of the Deceased and Hosen Ali.

16     From the Coroner’s Certificate which outlined the investigations carried out by PW3 from SCDF together with that of the Singapore Police Force (“the Police”) investigation officer, Ng Gim Hwee Jerome, from Bedok Police Division (PW4), the coroner recorded the following:

> (a)     The Premises were found to have housed no fewer than 34 occupants.

> (b)     The Police had interviewed 32 occupants – eight from Room 1, nine from Room 3, five from Room 5, three occupants from Room 7, two each from Rooms 8, 10 and 12, and a single occupant from Room 11. Each of them gave an account of how they were awakened by shouts as the fire developed and how they managed to escape.

> (c)     At Room 8 where the fire was found to have originated, one Mr Islam Mohamed Rakibul was the only person in occupation then while his roommate was outside. He was asleep when he felt the sensation of heat in close proximity. He woke up to the presence of thick smoke around his room. He immediately ran out of his bedroom to the ground floor for safety without notifying the workers in rooms 9 or 10. He stated that he had left his handphone charging on one of the power sockets.

> (d)     SCDF had established the cause of the fire as accidental and of electric origin.

17     The coroner concluded that the two deceased victims were apparently asleep and oblivious to the impending jeopardy when the smoke and combustion gases from the adjacent room entered Room 9. From the position of his body which was found to be lying on the floor in a supine position, it was likely that the Deceased had woken up but was quickly overcome by the toxic smoke of the fire and fell unconscious onto the floor before he could make his escape. The other victim, Hosen Ali, who was found on his bed, had likely inhaled a large amount of smoke and died in his sleep. Given these circumstances, the coroner found that the deaths of both men were tragic misadventures[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17).

## The plaintiff’s pleaded case

18     The plaintiff’s case is that the Four Defendants had breached their duty of care in ensuring that the Premises were fit for the accommodation of foreign workers thereby causing the death of the Deceased. The pleaded particulars of the Four Defendants’ negligence are as follows[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18):

> (a)     creating an improvised illegal dormitory for foreign workers,

> (b)     failing to ensure that the Premises were fit for occupancy,

> (c)     failing to ensure that the Premises were equipped with a fire protection system,

> (d)     failing to ensure that the Premises were compliant with statutory regulations for the housing of foreign workers,

> (e)     failing to inspect the Premises for any unlawful modifications,

> (f)     failing to prevent unlawful modifications of and to the Premises,

> (g)     failing to control the number of occupants in the Premises,

> (h)     failing to ensure that the electrical appliances, wiring and electrical services in the Premises were safe, adequate and compliant with regulations for housing foreign workers,

> (i)     exposing the Deceased to the risk of injury and/or danger and/or death,

> (j)     failing to take any or any adequate precautions for the safety of the (Deceased),

> (k)     failing to provide and/or maintain the Premises such that they would not pose a threat to the life of the Deceased, and

> (l)     causing the death of the Deceased.

19     It was also pleaded, in the alternative, that the Four Defendants had breached their statutory duties with respect to the Premises leading to the death of the Deceased, in particular[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19):

> (a)     failing to comply with the Planning Act,

> (b)     failing to comply with the Fire Safety Act,

> (c)     failing to ensure that the Premises complied with the guidelines of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) for the housing of foreign workers, and

> (d)     failing to comply with the URA’s prevailing occupancy cap.

## The Four Defendants’ defence

20     While the Four Defendants admitted being the joint owners of the Premises at which the Deceased was found dead, they denied all of the plaintiff’s allegations in their entirety and put him to strict proof[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20).

21     In respect of the Tenancy Agreement for the Premises, they asserted that it had been signed with HKH Construction Pte Ltd (“HKH”), and Mr Ho Kien Heng from HKH had assured them that the Premises would at all material times be occupied by less than eight workers who were employed by HKH[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21).

22     It had been clearly stated in the Tenancy Agreement that no sub-tenancy was to be allowed by HKH. Even if there had been a sub-tenancy, they were not aware of it, and it had been done without their knowledge, consent and/or permission. Further, it would also have been a breach of the Tenancy Agreement and illegal for HKH to enter into such sub-tenancy agreement and to house workers that were not employed by HKH[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22).

23     The Four Defendants further stated in their Defence that they had made periodic visits to the Premises, and they confirmed that the Premises were not converted into an “improvised dormitory” with 12 rooms as alleged. At all material times they received rental from Mr Ho of HKH only and no one else[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23).

24     If the Premises had been converted into a dormitory as alleged, this was done without their knowledge, consent and/or permission and amounted to a breach of the Tenancy Agreement. It was illegal for HKH, or anyone authorised by them, to make such unauthorised changes to the Premises and to house workers that were not employed by HKH without the Four Defendants’ express knowledge, permission, or consent. The Four Defendants averred that all workers who were present at the Premises other than the workers employed by HKH were trespassers to whom no duty is owed in law and in fact[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24).

25     The Four Defendants pleaded further that the Fire Safety Investigation Board from the SCDF had inspected the Premises a week before the fire on 3 April 2015 and had found nothing amiss. They denied any breach of any Fire and Safety Regulations and expressed surprise by the findings of the Fire Investigation Report[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25).

26     If the Premises were found to have been modified after the last inspection by the Fire and Safety Investigation Board prior to 3 April 2015, the Four Defendants pleaded that this was done without their knowledge, consent and/or permission. This was a breach of the Tenancy Agreement. It was illegal for HKH, or anyone authorised by them, to make such changes to the Premises and to house foreign workers such as the Deceased who were not employed by HKH and who were essentially trespassers[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26).

27     It was also the Four Defendants’ case that if the Deceased did die as a result of any breach of duty of care on their part as alleged in the Statement of Claim, the same was solely caused, or substantially contributed to, by the Deceased’s own negligence as well as the negligence of HKH, its servants and/or agents.

28     The Four Defendants pleaded that the Deceased was guilty of contributory negligence _inter alia_ by[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27):

> (a)     being an illegal trespasser on the Premises, and failing to inform the Four Defendants of his presence,

> (b)     failing to avoid any hazards on the floor of the Premises while he was there illegally,

> (c)     failing to exercise due safety and care while trespassing at the Premises,

> (d)     failing to take any or any adequate precautions for his own personal safety while using any electrical equipment at the Premises as a trespasser; and

> (e)     generally, failing to take all necessary and reasonable precautions to avoid injury.

29     As for the contributory negligence alleged against HKH, its servants and/or agents, the particulars alleged were _inter alia__[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)_:

> (a)     failing to exercise due safety and care while housing workers at the Premises,

> (b)     failing to take any or any adequate precautions for the workers’ personal safety while using any electrical equipment at the Premises,

> (c)     failing to supervise workers at the Premises on the use of electrical equipment in a careful manner and avoid or minimize any risk of injury,

> (d)     generally, failing to take all necessary and reasonable precautions to ensure that the workers avoid injury, and

> (e)     illegally modifying the Premises to house more than eight workers who were not employees of HKH knowing, or when they ought to have known, that to do so could be a hazard to the safety of the workers being housed at the said Premises.

## Issues

30     From the cases as pleaded by the parties, the issues which the court has to decide are the following:

> (a)     whether the Four Defendants owed a duty of care to the Deceased to ensure that the Premises were reasonably safe for the occupants including the Deceased;

> (b)     if so, whether the Four Defendants had breached their duty of care which caused the Deceased’s death; and

> (c)     whether there was any contributory negligence on the part of the Deceased.

### Whether the Four Defendants owed a duty of care to the Deceased

#### Plaintiff’s submissions

31     In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Liew Teck Huat (“Mr Liew”) had cited the Court of Appeal decision in _See Toh Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement Pte Ltd_ \[2013\] 2 SLR 284 (“_See Toh_”) for the applicable legal principles governing the imposition of a duty of care. In essence, the previous rules on occupiers’ liability are subsumed under the law of negligence and the general framework for the imposition of a duty of care under _Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 100</span> (“_Spandeck_”) will now apply.

32     As reiterated by the Court of Appeal in _See Toh_ at \[53\], the three elements to be established for the imposition of a duty of care under the _Spandeck_ test are:

> (a)    factual foreseeability, … described as “_not_ a necessary element in any claim in negligence, \[but\] _just … a threshold question_ which the court must be satisfied is fulfilled, failing which the claim does not even take off” … (see _Spandeck_ at \[76\]);

> (b)    sufficient legal proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant so as to justify imposing a _prima facie_ duty of care on the latter (referred to … at \[77\] of _Spandeck_ as “\[t\]he _first_ stage of the \[_Spandeck_\] test”… ; and

> (c)    the absence of policy considerations that ought to negate a duty of care (which is the second limb of the _Spandeck_ test).

33     Applying the principles enunciated in _See Toh_, Mr Liew submitted that the Four Defendants owed a duty of care to the Deceased. The following reasons were canvased in support[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29):

> (a)     The Four Defendants exercised control over the Premises as the owners and landlords of the Premises. They were plainly aware that the Premises were used to house tenants, and specifically, foreign workers.

> (b)     The threshold factual test of reasonable foreseeability was readily met as it was eminently foreseeable that entrants to the Premises would suffer injury or damage if the landlords and/or owners did not take reasonable care to eliminate danger.

> (c)     There was undoubtedly physical proximity between the Four Defendants (as the owners and landlords) and the Deceased by virtue of the fact that the Deceased was physically situated on their property.

> (d)     Circumstantial proximity was also present given that the Four Defendants as landlords had consented to the presence of tenants on the Premises, which would include the Deceased. The Four Defendants would not know the identity of the tenants residing in the Premises pursuant to the Tenancy Agreement in any case. There was no reason for the Deceased to be treated differently in law from a tenant under the Tenancy Agreement. This relationship _per se_ gives rise to a duty of care owed by the Four Defendants to the Deceased as a matter of law.

> (e)     Further, the Four Defendants exercised _de facto_ control over the Premises as owners and landlords by virtue of the clauses in the Tenancy Agreement, in particular clause 3(g) and clause 4(c) which read as follows:

>> Clause 3(g)

>> To permit the Landlord and the Landlord’s agents, surveyors and workmen with all necessary appliances to enter upon the said premises at all reasonable times by prior appointment …… for any repairs, alterations or improvements either of the said premises or any parts of any building in which the said premises may be a part of or adjoined to.

>> Clause 4(c)

>> The Landlord hereby agrees with the Tenant as follows:

>>> (c)    To keep the roof and exterior of the said premises and the main walls and structure and the main drains and sewerage pipes thereof in good tenantable repair throughout the term hereby created.

> (f)     It was not open to the Four Defendants to claim that their duty of care extended to the employees of HKH only and not the Deceased because he was a “trespasser”. The Deceased was a lawful entrant who was housed in the Premises as part of his employment in Singapore and under the arrangements made by the sixth defendant. Monthly rental had been paid on account of the Deceased’s residence at the Premises.

> (g)     Based on their own testimonies, the Four Defendants were aware of the state of the Premises as they had carried out periodic checks:

>> (i)       In conducting their checks, the Four Defendants ought to have seen the state of the Premises, and therefore knew or ought to have known that more than eight foreign workers had been housed in the Premises.

>> (ii)       While attending such inspections on site, the first defendant would have seen the unauthorised partitions erected, the existence of some 30 double-decker beds and the multitude of electrical appliances used. These observations would have led him to realize that the Premises were functioning as an improvised dormitory for foreign workers. The first defendant was therefore fully aware of the health and fire hazards the Premises were posing to its occupants.

>> (iii)       The Four Defendants had asserted that they had “ensured that the lights, plumbing and other matters like the electrical switches and wiring were regularly maintained at all times”[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30). This necessarily required physical inspections on their part since there was no other way to ensure that the electrical switches and wiring were properly maintained.

>> (iv)       Since the Four Defendants had, as they alleged, conducted such physical maintenance checks at the Premises, they would have known, or ought to have known, that the Premises were being used to house foreign workers, and that the Premises were overcrowded with the inevitable overuse of the basic facilities, especially the electrical sockets.

> (h)     The Four Defendants were fully aware that the Premises were operating as an improvised dormitory, but wilfully turned a blind eye to the numerous foreign workers who occupied the Premises. In the circumstances, the Four Defendants owed a _prima facie_ duty of care to all the occupants of the Premises, including the Deceased. This duty of care extended to ensuring that the Premises were safe and fit for accommodation.

34     Even if it were found that the Deceased was a trespasser on the Premises who did not have any legal justification for being on the Premises, the Four Defendants still owed him a duty of care. Whether or not a _prima facie_ duty of care arose vis-à-vis an unlawful entrant or a “trespasser” is a fact-sensitive inquiry to which the _Spandeck_ approach applies. The matters outlined in \[33 (a) to (d)\] above applied equally to justify a duty of care being owed by the Four Defendants to the Deceased whether or not he was classified as an unlawful entrant.

35     Applying the second limb of _Spandeck_, there were no policy considerations to negate the imposition of a duty of care owed by a landlord to entrants on his property.

#### Four Defendants’ submissions

36     The pleaded position of the Four Defendants was that the Deceased was an “illegal trespasser” to whom they owed no duty of care. In his closing submissions, Mr Deepak Natverlal, counsel for the Four Defendants (“Mr Natverlal”) reiterated that the Deceased was a trespasser on the Premises as he would fall within the common law definition of a trespasser – one who goes on the land-owner’s property without invitation of any sort and whose presence is either unknown to the owner, or, if known, is practically objected to[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31).

37     The focus of Mr Natverlal’s submissions was that the Deceased was a trespasser on the Premises and as such, no duty of care was owed by the Four Defendants to “unlawful” trespassers such as the Deceased whose existence at the Premises was not known to them. While it appears from the overall tenor of Mr Natverlal’s submissions that he accepts that the current law on occupiers’ liability is as laid down in _See Toh_, and the formulation of the occupier’s duty of care has to be the _Spandeck_ test, he nonetheless referred the court to _Khoo Ting Hong v Sim Guan Soon_ \[1968-1970\] SLR(R) 391 at \[4\] where the Court of Appeal had cited the English common law rule in _Latham v Richard Johnson & Nephew Ltd_ \[1911-1913\] All ER Rep 117 at 124 that:

> (t)he “owner of the property is under a duty not to injure the trespasser wilfully; ‘not to do’ a wilful act in reckless disregard of ordinary humanity towards him; but otherwise a man trespasses at his own risk.

38     It was submitted that the plaintiff had failed to show on the evidence that the Deceased was a lawful tenant entitled to be on the Premises. There was no tenancy agreement between the Four Defendants and the Deceased’s employer, the sixth defendant, to allow for the Deceased’s accommodation at the Premises. The Four Defendants had received no rental from the Deceased or the sixth defendant. In fact, the Four Defendants had no knowledge of the Deceased’s presence on the Premises until after the fire had taken place.

39     As for the plaintiff’s submission that the Four Defendants as landlord had control of the Premises by virtue of clauses 3(g) and 4(c) of the Tenancy Agreement, Mr Natverlal sought to highlight that:

> (a)     the Tenancy Agreement was signed only with HKH, and there was no legal nexus with the Deceased;

> (b)     clauses 3(g) and 4(c) of the Tenancy Agreement were general clauses that would appear in any tenancy agreement and cannot give rise to a duty of care being owed to trespassers; and

> (c)     while the clauses in the Tenancy Agreement obliged the Four Defendants to effect repairs where there were defects to the Premises, the Four Defendants had received no complaints from HKH of any defects or for any repairs that were needed to be carried out.

40     The Four Defendants were unaware of what HKH had done with the Premises once they were rented out, and as such, they had no control over what HKH did on the Premises without their knowledge and consent.

41     In response to the plaintiff’s contention that the Four Defendants either knew, or ought to have known, that the Premises had been used to house foreign workers, that it was overcrowded with the inevitable overuse of the basic facilities, especially the electrical sockets, since the first defendant had claimed that they had carried out periodic physical checks on the Premises and ensured that lights, plumbing and matters like electrical wiring were regularly maintained, the Four Defendants pointed out that none of them had been charged by the relevant authorities for any offence arising from the fire. Instead, action has been taken against the fifth defendant by the SCDF and URA[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32).

42     It was further submitted that the plaintiff had failed to show sufficient legal proximity between the occupier and the Deceased. In fact, there was no nexus between the Four Defendants as occupier and the Deceased.

43     The evidence put before the Coroner’s Inquiry as set out in his findings showed that the Four Defendants had no knowledge of who the Deceased was and how he had ended up at the Premises. The Four Defendants also had no knowledge of the matters that had transpired between HKH, the fifth defendant and the sixth defendant.

44     Accordingly, there could not be a duty of care owed by the Four Defendants as occupiers to the Deceased just because they were the owners of the Premises and the landlords under the Tenancy Agreement with HKH.

#### My decision

45     After _See Toh_, it is now well settled that the determination of an occupier’s liability in tort to persons who are injured on his property is no longer to be governed by the traditional classification of the victim into invitee, licensee or trespasser. The Court of Appeal (comprising a slightly different coram from that in _See Toh_) has reiterated this in a more recent decision in _Singapore Rifle Association v Singapore Shooting Association_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 616</span> (“_Singapore Rifle Association_”). Chao SJ, writing on behalf of the coram, has also clarified that there is effectively no difference in the approaches taken by Rajah JA and Menon CJ in their respective analyses of a duty of care towards lawful entrants in _See Toh_. The headnotes in _Singapore Rifle Association_ have succinctly summarised the current legal position thus:

> (1)    As held by the Court of Appeal in _See Toh Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 284</span> (“_See Toh_”), the law on occupiers’ liability should be subsumed under the tort of negligence, with the overarching framework set out in _Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 100</span> (“_Spandeck_”) for the imposition of a duty of care in negligence claims being applied to determine whether an occupier owed a duty of care to an entrant to his premises. Although V K Rajah JA and Sundaresh Menon CJ adopted slightly different approaches in _See Toh_, both approaches were consistent in so far as they both espoused, to a large extent, a fact-sensitive analysis of whether the occupier owed a _prima facie_ duty of care under the first stage of the _Spandeck_ approach. Neither judge took the view that the mere fact that a person was an occupier with control over the property and/or the activities carried out there was necessarily determinative in this regard. Under Menon CJ’s approach, a person’s status as occupier and his degree of control over the property and/or the activities carried out there were simply factors to be considered in the overall assessment of whether the requirement of legal proximity was satisfied. Under Rajah JA’s approach, it was merely a general rule that circumstantial proximity would be tautologically present where these two factors existed. Rajah JA was careful to add the caveat that a _prima facie_ duty of care would only be found in the vast majority of, but not all, cases involving lawful entrants. Accordingly, in order for the court to be satisfied that any given case was not an exceptional outlier, the court would likely have to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case concerned. It would seem that, in effect, the practical difference between the two judges’ approaches was more apparent than real..

> (2)    An occupier was not to be viewed as the insurer of the safety of his property or that of an entrant to his property. Rather, the duty of care owed by an occupier was merely to exercise reasonable care to eliminate danger on his property. What constituted “reasonable care” in a given context depended on the particular factual matrix concerned. The occupier’s duty to exercise reasonable care to eliminate danger on his property presupposed that the occupier actually knew or ought reasonably to have known of such danger..

46     Applying the _Spandeck_ framework, I agree with the submissions made by the plaintiff that the threshold test of reasonable foreseeability has been met in this case. The Premises had been used to rent out to companies for the accommodation of their workers. At the material time, it was leased to HKH, a construction company, to house its workers. It would be reasonably foreseeable that workers who reside at the Premises could suffer harm if there was failure on the part of the landlords to keep the Premises safe for occupation.

47     As for the test of proximity, this is dependent on the facts and circumstances of the case. As far as the plaintiff is concerned, the Deceased was legitimately on the Premises through arrangements made by his employer thus satisfying both physical and circumstantial proximity. There was no reason why the Deceased should be treated differently from any other tenant.

48     From the evidence adduced, I agree that the identity of the workers on the Premises was not a material consideration to the Four Defendants. This is because the Tenancy Agreement signed with HKH did not name who the occupants were supposed to be for the entire term. If it was indeed material, their names and possibly work permit numbers would have been stipulated in the Tenancy Agreement. The reasonable inference must be that the Four Defendants as landlords had no concerns as to the identities of the persons actually residing on the Premises as long as the number of occupants did not exceed the eight-person cap. As it must be within the contemplation of the parties that workers would come and go, it would have been acceptable for any worker with HKH’s consent to reside on the Premises. In that respect, I would agree with the plaintiff’s submission that the Deceased ought to be treated no different from a lawful entrant on the Premises.

49     Accordingly, I find that the Four Defendants had a general duty of care as landlords to ensure that the Premises were reasonably safe and fit for the occupation of their tenant or workers permitted by their tenant to reside on the Premises which would include persons such as the Deceased. This duty to take reasonable care would accord with the landlord’s duty to keep the demised premises in good and tenantable repair throughout the term of the tenancy as expressly stipulated in clause 4(c) of the Tenancy Agreement. Notably, the Four Defendants accept that they have such a duty as they testified in their AEICs as well as in court[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33).

50     Coming to the second stage of the _Spandeck_ test, there are no policy reasons that would militate against the imposition of a duty of care on property owners such as the Four Defendants to ensure the fitness and safety of their properties when let out for the occupation of workers. The submissions made by Mr Natverlal did not proffer any such policy reasons.

### Whether the Four Defendants had breached their duty of care which caused the Deceased’s death

#### Plaintiff’s submissions

51     It is the plaintiff’s case that the Four Defendants, as owners/landlords having control over the Premises, had breached their duty of care to the Deceased in the following respects[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34):

> (a)     they had allowed the Premises to be illegally converted into a dormitory and to become overcrowded;

> (b)     they had failed to put in place reasonable measures to prevent injury to the occupants as the Premises were not equipped with a fire protection system; and

> (c)     they had breached their statutory duties in allowing partitions to be erected on the Premises.

52     In support of his allegation that the Four Defendants had allowed the Premises to be overcrowded, the plaintiff referred to the findings recorded in the Coroner’s Certificate which stated that the Premises had been converted into an improvised dormitory for foreign workers which had “no fewer than 34 occupants” at the material time.

53     The plaintiff also relied on the evidence of one Thangarajah Thangamany (PW2). PW2 was a loss adjustor who had been appointed by NTUC Income Insurance Cooperative Ltd (“NTUC Income”), to investigate into the circumstances of the fire as the Premises had been insured by NTUC Income under their Home Insurance policy at the material time.

54     PW2 had inspected the Premises on 6 April 2015 and his observations as noted in his report were as follows[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35):

> (a)     the Premises had been extensively renovated and converted into a dormitory;

> (b)     the original five-bedroom apartment unit was converted to house 12 bedrooms. Many of the additional bedrooms were extremely small rooms measuring less than 50 square feet which had been created by erecting gypsum board partition walls;

> (c)     based on the number of double decker beds seen in the 12 bedrooms, it appeared that the Premises were designed and furnished to house a minimum of 60 workers;

> (d)     sub-standard materials were used for the renovations. The renovations appeared makeshift and did not look like they were done by professional contractors but by the tenant and/or the foreign workers.

55     It was submitted that the overcrowding of the Premises had led to the situation where the electrical facilities were used and strained beyond the intended capacity. The overloading of the electrical outlets led to a short circuit resulting in a fire. The Premises were a fire hazard, posing a real danger to the occupants.

56     The plaintiff submitted that the Four Defendants knew that it would not be safe for more than eight persons to reside on the Premises. They were fully aware that the Premises were going to be used as a dormitory and had pre-emptively raised the issue by highlighting that they had emphasised the prohibition to the agent that the Premises were not to be used as a dormitory in an attempt to evade liability should any problem arise. They were aware that the Premises had been converted into a dormitory since they had carried out periodic inspections.

57     The plaintiff pointed to the further investigations by PW2 which revealed that the third and fourth defendants owned another four apartment units in the Geylang vicinity which were also similarly used as dormitories housing foreign workers[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36). It was emphasised that the Four Defendants knew or ought to have known from the very beginning that the Premises were being used as a foreign workers’ dormitory. That was why when NTUC Income subsequently repudiated the insurance policy, they did not challenge or pursue any claim against the insurer on the ground that they had no knowledge the Premises had been converted into a dormitory.

58     The Four Defendants had also not commenced any action against their tenant, HKH, for breach of the Tenancy Agreement in subletting the Premises. If in fact they did not know of the subletting and the condition of the Premises, they would surely have been outraged by the incident and would have pursued a claim against their tenant. However, they had been content to absorb all losses for the damage to the Premises and had carried out the repairs without seeking recovery from any other party.

59     It was submitted that the Four Defendants had simply turned a blind eye to the reality of the situation despite knowing that the Premises were being operated as an improvised dormitory. They had failed to fulfil their duty as the owners and/or landlords to take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which one could reasonably foresee would be likely to injure the occupants of the Premises including the Deceased.

#### Four Defendants’ submissions

60     The Four Defendants submitted that even if they did owe a duty of care to the Deceased, the plaintiff has failed to show evidence of any breach of any duty on their part. Contrary to the plaintiff’s claim, they submitted that the findings documented in the Coroner’s Certificate wherein the death of the Deceased was determined as a tragic misadventure had in fact vindicated them from all responsibility for the fire incident[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37).

61     The circumstances leading to the condition of the Premises which had led to the fire on 3 April 2015 were stated in the Coroner’s Certificate. It was evident from the Coroner’s Certificate that the Four Defendants had no knowledge of what had transpired and how the Deceased had ended up at the Premises.

62     The plaintiff had adduced no evidence to support the allegation that it was the Four Defendants who had converted the Premises into a foreign workers’ dormitory and had materially changed the use of the Premises without a proper permit. It was clear that the tortfeasors in the present case were either Mr Ho Kien Heng of HKH, the fifth defendant, or Johid who had reportedly left Singapore[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38).

63     The Four Defendants pointed to the letters they had received from the Police which informed them that after careful consideration of the available facts and circumstances, no further action would be taken against any of them. In fact, multiple charges had been brought against the fifth defendant by the SCDF and the URA for offences committed in relation to the fire which would serve to vindicate the Four Defendants of any alleged breach of the relevant statutory provisions[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39).

64     Accordingly, it was submitted that on a balance of probabilities, the plaintiff had failed to prove his case in negligence against the Four Defendants.

65     Additionally, the Four Defendants contended that the plaintiff had also failed to show any evidence of any loss suffered arising from their alleged breaches of duty which would be fatal to his claim[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40). Referring to the Court of Appeal’s ruling in _Tan Woo Thian v PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 20</span> (“_Tan Woo Thian_”), it was submitted that even when the trial is bifurcated, as is the case here, the plaintiff is required to show that the loss he allegedly suffered was caused by a breach of the duty of care.

66     No evidence was produced by the plaintiff, whether in his AEIC or through his oral testimony, pertaining to the loss that he is claiming in this action.

#### My decision

67     At the outset, it is apposite to note that the duty of care owed by an occupier turns on the degree of control which an occupier has over the property concerned and/or the activities carried out there (per _See Toh_ at \[80\]). Occupiers such as the Four Defendants as landlords in the present case are not to be viewed as insurers of the safety of their property. This is only logical as a landlord would have no effective control of all the activities carried out on the premises by the occupants. It is also consonant with the covenant of quiet enjoyment of the premises that a tenant would be entitled to rely on which is usually stipulated in the written terms of the tenancy, or implied as a matter of law.

##### (1)   No direct evidence against Four Defendants

68     While the plaintiff had pleaded a long list of breaches of duty committed by the Four Defendants, the crux of his case was that they had allowed the Premises to be overcrowded and converted illegally into a dormitory cramped with 34 foreign workers. The Premises had become a “death trap” due to the erection of the unauthorised partitions and overloading of the electrical outlets[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41). There is, however, no direct evidence adduced that the Four Defendants were in any way involved, or were complicit, in the creation of the illegal dormitory at the Premises.

69     As found by the coroner, the conversion of the Premises by way of partitions into a dormitory which allowed for the increase in the number of occupants in the Premises beyond the capacity stipulated in the Tenancy Agreement and allowed under the relevant legislation was carried out by the fifth defendant and/or by Johid. This finding has not been challenged by the plaintiff who has, as a matter of fact, relied _in extenso_ on the coroner’s findings to establish his case. The entire Fire Investigation Report and the Coroner’s Certificate setting out the findings had been annexed to and formed part of the plaintiff’s statement of claim[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42).

70     The cause of the fire which eventually led to the Deceased’s death, as found by the SCDF investigation, was the overheated electrical wiring in the room next to where the Deceased was sleeping at the material time. The overheated electrical wiring was in all likelihood the result of the “daisy-chaining” of electrical socket outlets practised by the workers then occupying the Premises. These were activities conducted on the Premises by the occupants which the Four Defendants as landlords had no control over.

71     If there was evidence that the Premises had, at or before the commencement of the Tenancy Agreement with HKH, been partitioned into many rooms for occupancy as a workers’ dormitory, such evidence could conceivably pin liability on the Four Defendants for their role in the creation of the veritable “death trap” that led to the Deceased’s demise.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) No such evidence was however adduced. The Tenancy Agreement instead had an express stipulation that the Premises shall not be occupied by more than eight persons.

72     The Tenancy Agreement also prohibited subletting of the Premises as well as any alterations to the internal construction of the Premises without the written consent of the landlord[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44). There is no direct evidence adduced that the Four Defendants had known of and/or were complicit in these breaches of the Tenancy Agreement.

##### (2)   Hearsay evidence from PW2 inadmissible

73     In the report given by the loss adjuster, PW2, it was noted that the Four Defendants were unaware of the renovations and the usage of the Premises as a dormitory which had altered the risk insured under the insurance policy. This is consistent with the statements given by the defendants and recorded almost contemporaneously by the Police as part of their investigations right after the fire[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45).

74     As for the conversations which PW2 allegedly had with Mr Ho Kien Heng and the fifth defendant as set out in his report[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46), the contents of those conversations are hearsay and inadmissible:

> (a)     Mr Ho had purportedly told PW2 that he had agreed with the third defendant that the Premises would be used to house 15 to 20 foreign workers.

> (b)     The fifth defendant had told PW2 that when he took over the Premises from Mr Ho, there were already partitions and double decker beds.

75     The plaintiff could have called Mr Ho Kien Heng as a witness to prove the condition of the Premises and the timeframe when they had been converted into a dormitory to house over 30 workers but did not do so.

76     It had also been put to the third defendant (DW2) during his cross-examination by Mr Liew, that he had been running a lucrative business of acquiring and renting out his properties as foreign worker dormitories and using the façade of putting a company’s name on the tenancy agreements[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47). This allegation was categorically denied by DW2. The plaintiff had adduced no admissible evidence to back up such an allegation since the contents of PW2’s report of his conversations with Mr Ho and the fifth defendant amount to hearsay. No notice to admit hearsay evidence had been given.

77     The plaintiff had also alleged that the Four Defendants were able to secure rental for the Premises at $5,600 only because they were to be used as a foreign workers’ dormitory rather than a private residence. No evidence of what the market rental was for similar Geylang properties at the material time was however adduced.

78     As it is the plaintiff who has the burden of proving that the Four Defendants knew that the Premises had been converted to, or were being used as a foreign workers’ dormitory, I disagree with Mr Liew’s submission that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Four Defendants for failing to call the individuals they had dealt with for the rental of the Premises[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48). Presumably the relevant persons would be the housing agent or Mr Ho Kien Heng as they would be able to testify whether the Four Defendants knew that the Premises were then being used as a dormitory. Since the testimonies of these individuals would have advanced the plaintiff’s case, it begs the question why the plaintiff had failed to call them to testify.

##### (3)   Plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden of proof

79     In the final analysis, it appears that at the close of the plaintiff’s case, all that the plaintiff had presented to the court were:

> (a)     the observations of PW2 on the state of the Premises after the fire and conclusions he made,

> (b)     the evidence of PW3 on the cause of the fire which had led to the Deceased’s death,

> (c)     the various inconsistencies in the evidence given by the first, third and fourth defendants in their AEICs and in cross-examination[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49), and

> (d)     the inferences to be drawn from the failure of the Four Defendants to pursue any claim against NTUC Income on the fire insurance policy[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50), and HKH for the breaches of the Tenancy Agreement.[^51]

80     Contrary to the plaintiff’s submission, the evidence adduced is inadequate to prove that the Four Defendants knew, or ought to have known, that the Premises were an overcrowded fire hazard that was unfit and unsafe for the occupants.

81     As outlined in \[73\] and \[74\] above, PW2’s conclusions were made without reliable and admissible evidence.

82     PW3’s evidence on the cause of the fire leading to the death of the Deceased pointed to activities carried out on the Premises by the occupants which were not within the control of the Four Defendants as landlords.

83     While the testimonies of the first, third and fourth defendants contained inconsistencies as to whether they had, or had not made, periodic visits to the Premises[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) during the term of the Tenancy Agreement, I was unable to conclude that this reeked of a cover-up on their part as submitted by Mr Liew[^53]. From my observation of the first, third and fourth defendants when they were on the witness stand, these were not sophisticated individuals who were fully conversant of their rights and obligations. It seems to me that the inaccuracies in their AEICs were not due to any blatant dishonesty on their part but simply a case of bad drafting.

84     In my overall assessment of their evidence in the conditioned statements given to the Police, their AEICs and answers given in cross-examination, on a balance of probabilities, I find that only the first defendant and the third defendants had visited the Premises before the tenancy commenced or at any time prior to the fire. The first defendant, as the signatory of the tenancy agreements, had visited the Premises once before the Tenancy Agreement was signed[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54). As for the third defendant, he had also visited the Premises in the first week of the tenancy when he had seen four to five workers at the Premises[^55]. There is no evidence that during this initial period, the Premises had already been partitioned into 12 rooms.

85     There was mention of another visit or inspection by the third defendant to the Premises together with SCDF officers a week before the fire but since no documentary evidence of this has been adduced, I am unable to make any finding based on a mere assertion by the defendants. The fact of such a visit had also been challenged by the plaintiff during cross-examination[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56).

86     As for the failure by the Four Defendants to pursue a claim against their erstwhile tenant, HKH, for breaches of the Tenancy Agreement, I am unable to accept that this fact could advance the plaintiff’s case. Given that HKH was in financial trouble, there was no compelling reason for the Four Defendants to incur legal costs if the prospects of recovery against HKH were doubtful[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57). This might very well be the same reason why the plaintiff had not included HKH as a defendant in the proceedings.

87     In regard to the third defendant’s failure to challenge NTUC Income on its repudiation of the “Home” insurance policy, this fact similarly did not add any weight to the plaintiff’s case. The Four Defendants had referred the matter to their lawyers. Given the attendant risks of any litigation, it was not unreasonable for the Four Defendants to forebear from taking action regardless of whether they had prior knowledge of the breaches of the Tenancy Agreement.

88     Taken together, I am unable to find that the Four Defendants were aware at the commencement of the Tenancy Agreement that the Premises had been partitioned for use as a dormitory for foreign workers. Consequently, I have to disagree with Mr Liew’s claim that there is overwhelming evidence that the Four Defendants knew or ought to have known that the Premises had become an overcrowded fire hazard.

89     In my overall assessment of the evidence, I am unable to find that the plaintiff has discharged his burden of proving that the Four Defendants have breached their duty of care as landlords to the Deceased which had caused or contributed to the death of the Deceased.

90     I should add that in my analysis of the evidence, I have not taken cognisance of the matters raised by Mr Natverlal in his further reply closing submissions which had referred to a copy of a newspaper report on the criminal proceedings against Johid and the fifth defendant. A proper application should be made to adduce further evidence and not by way of written submissions only.

##### (4)   Proof of loss

91     For completeness, I should also address the issue raised by Mr Natverlal in his reply submissions that the plaintiff has failed to show any evidence of loss caused by the alleged breach of duty on the part of the Four Defendants, relying on _Tan Woo Thian_. The Court of Appeal in _Tan Woo Thian_ had observed that in order to make out the tort of negligence, it must first be shown that a defendant’s breach has in fact caused loss. Even when the trial is bifurcated between liability and quantum, a plaintiff would have to show that he did suffer one or more types of loss that was causally connected to the alleged breach at the liability stage of the trial.

92     With respect, I disagree with Mr Natverlal’s submission. In the present case, the plaintiff is the father, next-of-kin and the appointed administrator of the Deceased’s estate. The claim is made for the Deceased’s estate as well as for the plaintiff’s loss of dependency as pleaded in the statement of claim[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58). The Deceased’s loss of his life is clear proof of a loss that is causally connected to a breach of duty had the plaintiff successfully discharged his burden of proof. The plaintiff had also in his statement of claim and AEIC made reference to a claim for funeral expenses and costs for obtaining the grant of letters of administration which would be consequential expenses following the death of the Deceased.

### Whether there was any contributory negligence on the part of the Deceased

93     Based on my finding that the plaintiff has failed to prove any breach of duty against the Four Defendants, the issue of any contributory negligence by the Deceased does not arise.

94     Should I be wrong in my finding however, I agree with Mr Liew’s submission that the Deceased cannot be found to be contributorily negligent. There is no evidence to suggest that the Deceased had acted in any manner detrimental to his own safety. He was provided accommodation at the Premises by his employer and was asleep when the fire engulfed the Premises. None of the particulars of his alleged contributory negligence pleaded in the Joint Defence[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) is applicable in the circumstances of this case.

## Conclusion

95     As found by the coroner, the Deceased’s death was a tragic misadventure. He had been housed by his employer in accommodation which was overcrowded and proved to be a fire safety hazard. The individuals responsible for the conversion of the Premises into an improvised dormitory in breach of regulatory requirements had been identified in the Coroner’s Certificate the contents of which the plaintiff had relied on for the purposes of this action.

96     The plaintiff had instead pursued a claim against the owners and landlords of the Premises based on disparate pieces of circumstantial evidence. In my overall analysis, the evidence adduced was insufficient to discharge the plaintiff’s burden of proof on a balance of probabilities. In the premises, the plaintiff’s claim against the Four Defendants is dismissed with costs. The Court will hear submissions on costs on a date to be fixed.
