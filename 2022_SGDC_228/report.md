Extradition – Extradition Agreements – Procedure – Extraditable offences

03 October 2022

### District Judge Loh Hui-min:

1       This was an application by the State under s 11(7) of the Extradition Act 1968, as was in force prior to 1 July 2022 (“the Act”), to commit one Chester YANG Yang, Jr. @ “Chester Yang, Jr”, “Pian He Yang”” and “Tian He Yang” (“Yang”) to prison to await the warrant of the Minister for his surrender to the United States of America (“the US”). Yang was wanted by the US to stand trial for three charges of sexual offences against a five-year-old child (“the Victim”) committed on 21 April 2017.

2       The application was strenuously resisted by Yang. Two novel issues of treaty interpretation, which have yet to be fully considered in our local jurisprudence, arose during the proceedings. First, whether Yang’s detention was in breach of Article 11 of the extradition treaty between the US and Singapore (“the Treaty”), and therefore unlawful. Second, whether the alleged offences fell to be offences for which extradition shall be reciprocally granted under Article 3 of the Treaty.

3       After hearing the evidence presented by the State and Yang, as well as their arguments, I found that Yang was liable to be surrendered to the US in respect of the three charges. Accordingly, I issued a warrant committing him to prison to await the warrant from the Minister for his surrender under s 11(7) of the Act. I now elaborate on the reasons for my decision.

## Relationship between the Treaty and the Act

4       I begin first by briefly setting out the relationship between the Treaty and the Act. This has been explored at some length in _Wong Yuh Lan v Public Prosecutor and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 161</span> (“_Wong Yuh Lan_”). I do not propose to repeat the analysis here, save to highlight matters relevant to the present case.

5       The Treaty is derived from the extradition treaty of 22 December 1931 entered between the United Kingdom (“the UK”) and the US which was given effect to by the United States of America (Extradition) Order in Council 1935, and extended to every “British possession”, including Singapore, by the various Extradition Acts in the UK (see _Wong Yuh Lan_ at \[4\]). There was no dispute between the parties that the UK-US Treaty continued to apply between US and Singapore post-independence. In any event, this is also clear from the ‘Exchange of Letters Constituting an Agreement Between the United States of America and Singapore for the Continued Application to Singapore of the United States/United Kingdom Treaty of December 22, 1931 Concerning Extradition’ (the “1969 Exchange of Letters”).

6       The US therefore falls within the definition of “foreign State” in s 2 of the Act, being a foreign State between which and Singapore an extradition treaty is in force. Section 3(1) of the Act provides that Part 2 of the Act shall apply in relation to the extradition arrangement between Singapore and the US. Section 3(2) of the Act further provides that Part 2 of the Act shall apply subject to “any limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications” in the Treaty. Put simply, whilst the Act lays down the framework for extradition and matters connected to the same, its scope continues to be subject to the parties’ mutual obligations as set out in the Treaty.

## Preliminary Issue – whether Yang’s remand was unlawful

7       At the hearing, Yang raised a preliminary point that his remand was unlawful as the State had failed to produce sufficient evidence for his extradition within two months from the date of his apprehension, in breach of Article 11 of the Treaty which states:

> If sufficient evidence for the extradition be not produced within two months from the date of the apprehension of the fugitive, or within such further time as the High Contracting Party applied to, or the proper tribunal of such High Contracting Party, shall direct, the fugitive shall be set at liberty.

8       To provide context to Yang’s contention, it is first necessary to set out the procedural background of the matter.

### Procedural Background

9       On 30 May 2022, the Singapore Police Force had applied for a warrant for the apprehension of Yang to be issued under s10(1)(_b_) of the Act.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) The warrant of apprehension under s 10(1)(_b_) of the Act was issued by the Magistrate on 31 May 2022[^2] and Yang was apprehended on the same day.[^3] On 1 June 2022, Yang was brought before a Magistrate as required by s 11(1) of the Act and the Magistrate ordered his remand as provided for under s 11(2) of the Act.[^4]

10     The events that followed were not disputed by parties:

> (a)     As provided for under s 11(2) of the Act, Yang was continuously remanded for periods not exceeding 7 days at a time.

> (b)     On 27 July 2022, Singapore received the requisition for the surrender of Yang from the US through the usual diplomatic channels.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) The requisition contained a warrant of arrest for Yang issued by the US and the evidence in support of its request to extradite Yang.[^6]

> (c)     On 29 July 2022, the Magistrate was informed at a further mention for the matter, that the requisition from the US had been received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The matter was adjourned by the Magistrate for the Minister of Law (“the Minister”) to issue the notice under s 9(1)(_b_) of the Act (“the Minister’s Notice”) and for the requisition to be forwarded to Court.

> (d)     The Minister’s Notice was issued on 3 August 2022 and the following day, 4 August 2022, the requisition was placed before the Magistrate at a further mention for the matter.

11     The matter was eventually fixed for a hearing before me on 18 August 2022 and the warrant committing him to prison to await his surrender to the US was issued on 24 August 2022.

### Parties’ arguments

12     Parties agreed that Article 11 of the Treaty applied in the present case but differed on the interpretation of the term “produced” therein.

13     Yang contended that the term “produced” referred to the production of evidence for extradition _in Court_ and that this was not done until 4 August 2022, more than two months after his apprehension. He therefore argued that the State had breached Article 11 of the Treaty and that his remand after 29 July 2022 was unlawful.

14     State Counsel Ms Ong submitted that the term “produced” referred to the production of evidence for extradition _to Singapore_ and not the Court. Therefore, the receipt by Singapore of the requisition containing such evidence on 27 July 2022 was within the prescribed time in Article 11. In support of her submission, Ms Ong cited the decision of the House of Lords in _Government of the Federal Republic of Germany v Sotiriadis and Anor_ <span class="citation">\[1975\] AC 1</span> (“_Sotiriadis_”).

15     Ms Ong submitted in the alternative, that even if Yang’s interpretation of “production” was correct, the Magistrate had validly extended the time to produce the said evidence as prescribed by Article 11 of the Treaty.

### Sotiriadis

16     I turn first to consider the decision in _Sotiriadis_ which concerned the interpretation of Schedule 2, Article XII of the Federal Republic of Germany (Extradition) Order 1960 (“the Anglo-German Treaty”) which states as follows:

> If sufficient evidence for the extradition be not produced within two months from the date of the apprehension of the fugitive, he shall be set at liberty.

17     In _Sotiriadis_, the fugitive had been arrested on 5 April 1973 pursuant to an arrest warrant issued under s 8(2) of the Extradition Act 1870 (33 & 34 Vic. c. 52) (“the Extradition Act 1870”). On 2 June 1973, the Home Office delivered to the Magistrate at Bow Street the Secretary of State’s order under s 7 of the Extradition Act 1870, dated 1 June 1973, signifying that a requisition for the surrender of the fugitive had been made by Germany. On 4 June 1973, the Magistrate was handed English translations of the depositions of witnesses taken in Germany. However, the original, duly authenticated depositions which had been received by the Home Office on 4 June 1973, were not forwarded to the Magistrate until 6 June 1973. The fugitive applied for a writ of habeas corpus citing a breach of Article XII of the Anglo-German Treaty, as no sufficient evidence to justify his committal had been produced within two months of the date of his apprehension on 5 April 1973, _i.e._, by 5 June 1973.

18     The Divisional Court allowed the fugitive’s application, but this was overturned on appeal by the House of Lords. Their decision turned on the interpretation of the terms “apprehension” and “produced” in Schedule 2, Article XII of the Anglo-German Treaty.

19     As regards the term “apprehension”, they held that upon ordinary principles of construction, it must bear the same meaning as the terms “arrest” and “apprehension” in Schedule 2, Article IX of the Anglo-German Treaty, which provided that “_the competent authorities of the State applied to shall proceed to the arrest of the fugitive_” upon receiving a requisition for extradition in accordance with the stipulations of Schedule 2, Article VIII of the Anglo-German Treaty, and bring him before a Magistrate for examination, “_as if the apprehension had taken place for a crime committed in the same country_” (_Sotiriadis_ at 18D, 23A, 36H-37A).

20     They found that this “apprehension” effected after and pursuant to a requisition under Schedule 2, Article VIII of the Anglo-German Treaty was **_separate and distinct_** from the apprehension of the fugitive made pursuant to an arrest warrant issued under s 8(2) of the Extradition Act 1870:

> (a)     Section 8(2) of the Extradition Act 1870 provided for the provisional/precautionary arrest of a fugitive _before_ the requisition for his surrender has been received by the Secretary of State and signified to the Magistrate (_Sotiriadis_ at 25C). In this regard, the charge(s) on which the fugitive was arrested would be inchoate, insofar as the foreign government had yet to confirm that it was being proceeded on by way of requisition. Furthermore, the process under s 8(2) of the Extradition Act 1870 did not need to be set into motion by the foreign government or at its instance. It would therefore be contrary to the intention of parties to have the two months run from a date which the foreign government had no part in selecting and where the charge(s) proceeded on by the foreign government (and for which sufficient evidence must be produced) had yet to be confirmed (_Sotiriadis_ at 18B-C, 25H and 27B-C).

> (b)     Further, the provisional/precautionary arrest procedure had its own safeguards against undue detention and delay, namely (i) the issuance of the provisional/precautionary arrest warrant must be reported to the Secretary of State who many order it to be cancelled and the fugitive discharged; and (ii) where the Magistrate did not receive from the Secretary of State the order signifying that a requisition for the surrender of the fugitive, “within such reasonable time as, with reference to the circumstances of the case, as \[the Magistrate\] may fix” the fugitive may be discharged. As was observed by Lord Wilberforce, “\[t\]he existence of these specific safeguards thus diminishes the force of the argument for bringing the period of detention under provisional warrant within the two months” (_Sotiriadis_ at 18A).

> (c)     That a different type of apprehension was contemplated by the Anglo-German Treaty was bolstered by s 7 Extradition Act 1870, which provided that upon receiving the requisition for surrender of the fugitive from the foreign government, the Secretary of State may “signify to a police magistrate that such requisition has been made _and require him to issue his warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive criminal_...” (emphasis added in _italics_), even though the fugitive may already be in custody pursuant to s 8(2) of the Extradition Act 1870. It was at this point, that the precautionary/provisional arrest ceased to have effect and thenceforth, the fugitive was under the protection, as regards delay, of Schedule 2 Article XI of the Anglo-German Treaty (_Sotiriadis_ at 36E-F).

21     In the premises, the House of Lords held that the two months ran from 4 June 1973, being after the Secretary of State’s order under s 7 of the Extradition Act 1870 had been issued and the date on which the fugitive had been further remanded by the Magistrate.

22     Turning to the meaning of “produced”, there was a 3-2 split in opinion, with the majority holding that “produced” referred to production to the requested State and not to the court.

23     Lord Cross held that the production of sufficient evidence meant no more than “the production of evidence which the magistrate would have judged to be sufficient to justify extradition if the fugitive called no evidence to rebut it and advanced no arguments either himself or by his representatives against that conclusion” (_Sotiriadis_ at 32D-F citing _Reg. v Governor of Ashford Remand Centre, Ex parte Beese_ <span class="citation">\[1973\] 1 WLR 1426</span>).

24     Lord Cross then went on to consider the position if the evidence in question consists of sworn depositions or statements taken in the foreign State which have been duly authenticated (_Sotiriadis_ at 32H-33F):

> One view would be that they are not “produced” until they are laid before the magistrate in open court; but I cannot think that that can be right. **Suppose that depositions properly certified and authenticated and accompanied by translations which raise a strong prima facie case again the fugitive have been lodged at Bow Street within the two month period but owing to pressure of business or an epidemic of influenza affecting the magistracy the case cannot be heard until after two months have expired how could it be said with any show of reason that the foreign state had failed to produce sufficient evidence within the period specified in the treaty? To say so would be to add insult to injury.** … But if one goes so far … as to say that the foreign state produces sufficient evidence within the two months if the \[evidence in question\] arrive at Bow Street within the two months, ought one not to go further and say that the lodging of such documents with the Foreign Officer within the two months is sufficient even if they are not transmitted to Bow Street until after the expiry of two months … I think that on a fair reading of the treaty if evidence which the magistrate subsequently decides is itself sufficient to justify extradition has been lodged with the Foreign Office within the two months it has been “produced” within that period for the purpose of article XII. \[Emphasis added in **bold**\]

25     In a similar vein, Lord Wilberforce opined (_Sotiriadis_ at 18F- H):

> There are sound practical reasons, no doubt, for holding that production means production to the court which has, under the Treaty, to decide upon the sufficiency of what is produced. But the scheme of the Treaty appears to me to favour the other view, that production means production by the requesting government to the government requested – i.e., the date of receipt by the normal government channel, called, in the Treaty, the diplomatic agents, through whom the requisition has to be made. **I do not think that it can have been intended that whereas between governments, the necessary evidence has been delivered within the Treaty period, the requesting government is to lose its Treaty rights on account of delay in transmission to the requested state’s courts**, and it does not logically follow from the fact that it is the courts which have to pronounce on the sufficiency of the evidence, that the date of production is to be the date of production to the court. If, therefore, the evidence produced to the Foreign Office is, in the result, held to be sufficient, and it is produced within two months from the apprehension, I would hold that it was in time. \[Emphasis added in **bold**\]

26     The minority dissented and opined that evidence for the extradition was not “produced” until it was received at the Bow Street magistrate’s court, although this may be before it is tendered in open court. However, no reasoning was provided for their dissenting opinion (_Sotiriadis_ at 28G (Lord Diplock), 30H (Lord Simon agreeing)).

### Interpretation of Article 11 of the Treaty

27     There is no doubt some similarity in wording between Article 11 of the Treaty and Schedule 2, Article XII of the Anglo-German Treaty. However, caution must be exercised in applying the analysis in _Sotiriadis_ here. As is evident from the exercise undertaken there, the interpretation of treaty provisions depends also on their context (see also Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties).

28     On closer examination, the scheme of the Treaty differs from that of the Anglo-German Treaty in one significant manner. Instead of setting out a procedure for the apprehension of a fugitive criminal after the requisition is made to the requested State, Article 8 of the Treaty states:

> The extradition of fugitive criminals under the provisions of this Treaty shall be carried out...**in conformity with the laws regulating extradition for the time being in force in the territory from which the surrender of the fugitive criminal is claimed**. \[emphasis in **bold**\]

The contracting parties have therefore incorporated into their agreement, their respective domestic laws regulating extradition in force at the time the request for surrender is made. In the present case, this would be in the main Part 2 of the Act, being the law regulating extradition for the time being in force in the territory from which the surrender of the fugitive criminal is claimed (see \[6\] _supra_). This would include the apprehension of a fugitive pursuant to a warrant for apprehension issued (i) with authorisation of the Minister by Minister’s Notice (see s 10(1)(_a_) of the Act) **_or_** (ii) without the authorisation of the Minister, where there is evidence produced to the Magistrate that would justify the fugitive’s apprehension if the act or omission constituting the extradition crime had taken place in, or within the jurisdiction of Singapore (see s 10(1)(_b_) of the Act).

29     Accordingly, the term “apprehension” in Article 11 of the Treaty should be construed to encompass the apprehension of a fugitive pursuant to any warrant for apprehension issued under s 10 of the Act. As Lord Kilbrandon observed in _Sotiriadis_ in relation to the Swiss-UK Treaty (at 37D), “the issue of the provisional warrant is, … made part of the contractual agreement; _such an agreement ought no doubt to be construed on the basis of the time limit embracing all the procedures therein agreed upon_.” The contracting parties are thus taken to have agreed to the two months running from the time the fugitive is apprehended, regardless of whether the warrant for apprehension was issued pursuant to a Minister’s Notice.

30     My view was further bolstered by the fact that under s 9(1)(_b_) of the Act, where the fugitive has already been apprehended pursuant to a warrant issued under s 10(1)(_b_) of the Act, the Magistrate is not required to issue another warrant of apprehension upon receiving the Minister’s Notice that the requisition had been made. This can be contrasted to s 7 of the Extradition Act 1870 (see \[20(c)\] _supra_). Thus, where the fugitive has already been apprehended pursuant to a warrant issued under s 10(1)(_b_) of the Act, there is no “fresh” apprehension of the fugitive from which the two months period could otherwise have run.

31     In my judgment therefore, the two-months period provided for in Article 11 of the Treaty ran from the date of Yang’s apprehension (_i.e._, 31 May 2022).

32     I turn next to the meaning of “produced” in Article 11 of the Treaty. I had in my oral decision stated that I found that the reasoning of the majority in _Sotiriadis_ persuasive. I shall now elaborate.

33     As a starting point, it is important to recall that the Treaty sets out the mutually agreed upon obligations of the contracting parties. In this light, Article 11 of the Treaty imposes an obligation on the _requesting_ State to produce sufficient evidence for the extradition within a certain time. In my view, this must logically mean producing such evidence _to the requested State_ through the appropriate diplomatic channels. This is because the requesting State would not have control over the transmission of this evidence to the requested State’s courts or its production in open court thereafter. The observations of the majority in _Sotiriadis_ are apposite – the contracting parties could not have intended to lose their Treaty rights on account of delay (deliberate or otherwise) on the part of the requested State. Furthermore, as was held in _Sotiriadis_ (at 18H), it does not logically follow from the fact that it is the courts which have to pronounce on the sufficiency of the evidence, that the date of production is to be the date of production to the court. It remains open to the apprehended fugitive to allege that the evidence produced by the US to Singapore within that two-months period was insufficient and for the court to determine this.

34     I was thus inclined to agree with Ms Ong that “produced” in Article 11 of the Treaty refers to the production of evidence to the requested State through the appropriate diplomatic channels.

35     However, as I indicated in my oral decision, I did not need to arrive at a firm determination on the meaning of “produced”. This is because Article 11 also expressly provides that the two months can be extended to “such further time as the High Contracting Party applied to, or the proper tribunal of such High Contracting Party, shall direct”. Therefore, even if I had taken Yang’s objection at its highest and accepted that sufficient evidence had not been produced by 29 July 2022, time to do so had been validly extended by the Magistrate at the mention on 29 July 2022. The evidence in question had eventually been produced before a Magistrate at the mention on 4 August 2022, or at the latest, at the hearing before me on 18 August 2022.

36     I therefore rejected Yang’s objection that his remand after 29 July 2022 was in breach of Article 11 of the Treaty and found that his remand was lawful.

### Coda: Section 11(6) of the Act

37     As a coda, I wish to make some brief observations on the operation of s 11(6) of the Act, which was peripherally referred to in the State’s submissions.

38     Sections 11(5) and (6) of the Act provide:

> (5)    If the person was apprehended under a warrant issued otherwise than in pursuance of an authority by the Minister in a notice under section 9(1)(a), the Magistrate shall remand the person in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) until the Magistrate receives a notice under section 9(1)(b) from the Minister informing the Magistrate that a requisition for the surrender of the person has been made to the Minister by a foreign State.

> (6)    Where the Magistrate does not receive such a notice within such time as is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances, the Magistrate shall —

>> (a)    if the person apprehended is held in custody, order that he be released; or

>> (b)    if he has been admitted to bail, make an order discharging the recognizances upon which he was admitted to bail.

Section 11(6) of the Act therefore confers upon the Magistrate the power to order the fugitive’s release where the Minister’s Notice under s 9(1)(_b_) of the Act is not received “within such time as is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances”. The purpose of this power is to act as a safeguard against undue delay.

39     In the absence of detailed submissions from parties, I do not propose to set out detailed guidelines to determining what a reasonable time is under s 11(6) of the Act. Nevertheless, it seems to me common sensical that in determining reasonable time, the Magistrate ought to have cognisance of the time that has elapsed since the fugitive’s apprehension and the reason why the Minister’s Notice has yet to be issued.

40     Where the Treaty is applicable and if the Minister’s Notice has not been issued because the US has yet to make its requisition to the Minister or produce its evidence for extradition,[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) the Magistrate ought to have regard to the two-months period provided for in Article 11 of the Treaty. In my view, it is only logical (and in keeping with the contracting States’ intentions) that the fugitive ought not be released _before_ the requesting State has had a chance to fulfil its Treaty obligations. This is not to say though that the fugitive **_must_** be immediately released upon the expiry of the two months period from his/her apprehension. As mentioned above, the two-months period in Article 11 of the Treaty may be validly extended (see \[35\] _supra_) and such extension if granted, will have to be considered by the Magistrate in its determination of reasonable time under s 11(6) of the Act.

41     The foregoing is of course but one of many scenarios. Ultimately, as s 11(6) of the Act itself makes clear, the Magistrate must have regard to “_all the circumstances_” in determining reasonable time, having regard to the purpose of the power conferred.

42     Had Yang raised the issue, I would have been minded to find that the Minister’s Notice had been received by the Magistrate within a reasonable time. Only a week had elapsed from the time the requisition from the US was received by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Minister’s Notice being issued. There was, in my view, no undue delay which would have justified Yang’s release from remand.

## Conditions for Issuance of a Warrant of Commitment

43     The conditions to be satisfied before Yang could be committed to await the Minister’s warrant for his surrender to the US are set out in s 11(7) of the Act and are as follows:

> (a)     There must be a duly authenticated foreign warrant issued in the US in respect of Yang.

> (b)     Yang is a “fugitive” accused of committing offences in the US which fall to be an “extradition crime” as defined in s 2 of the Act.

> (c)     The Court must be satisfied that there is evidence, which according to the law in force in Singapore, would justify the trial of Yang if the acts constituting the “extradition crime” he is being accused of had taken place in, or within the jurisdiction of Singapore.

44     In addition, the State submitted, and I agreed, that the offences made out by Yang’s alleged conduct must fall within one of the categories of offences for which extradition shall be reciprocally granted, as enumerated in Article 3 of the Treaty.

45     It is to these conditions that I now turn.

## Duly authenticated foreign warrant

46     A certified true copy of the Warrant of Arrest issued by the United States Superior Court of California, County of San Diego dated 11 March 2017 for the arrest of one “Yang JR Chester Yang” alias “Yang Chester Yang” was produced.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) The Warrant of Arrest was signed by one Steven E. Stone, the Presiding Judge of the said court and authenticated by oath of a witness, one Melissa C. Diaz[^9], and sealed with the Seal of the Department of State.

47     In the premises, there was a foreign warrant duly authenticated in accordance with s 42(2)(_d_) of the Act and I was satisfied that this condition under s 11(7)(_a_) of the Act was met.

## Whether Yang is a “fugitive”, and the alleged offences fall to be “extradition crimes” under the Act

48     A “fugitive” is defined in s 2 of the Act as being “_a person who is accused of an extradition crime that is alleged to have been committed, … at a place within the jurisdiction of a foreign State … and is, …, in Singapore_”. Yang was in Singapore. The three offences Yang had been accused of committing took place in the County of San Diego, State of California and it was not disputed that this was within the jurisdiction of the US. The remaining issue to be determined was whether the three alleged offences fell to be “extradition crimes” as defined in s 2 of the Act.

49     “Extradition crime” is defined in s 2 of the Act as follows:

> “extradition crime”, in relation to a foreign State, means an offence against the law of, or of a part of, a foreign State and the act or omission constituting the offence or the equivalent act or omission would, it if took place in or within the jurisdiction of Singapore, constitute an offence against the law in force in Singapore that –

>> (a)    is described in the First Schedule;

>> …

50     As the learned Judge in _Wong Yuh Lan_ observed, the definition of “extradition crime” captures the principle of double criminality, _i.e._, that the conduct which is the subject of the charge in the extradition request must be punishable in both Singapore and the US. In applying the principle, the courts have a choice between the “ingredients test” and the “conduct test”. I was guided by the High Court’s decision in _Wong Yuh Lan_ and the reasons cited therein (at \[18\]) to adopt the “conduct test” as opposed to the “ingredients test”. This requires the court to look at the _conduct_ alleged against the fugitive and to determine whether that conduct would have been criminal had it been committed in or within the jurisdiction of Singapore (_Wong Yuh Lan_ at \[14\]). In this regard, the High Court also cautioned against adopting an overly technical approach (_Wong Yuh Lan_ at \[13\]).

### Counts One and Three

51     Count One was for the offence of ‘Oral copulation/sexual penetration with a child 10 years old or younger’, in violation of California Penal Code Section 288.7(b). Count Three was for the offence of ‘Lewd act upon a child’, in violation of Section 288(a) of the California Penal Code.

52     The same alleged conduct by Yang supports the foregoing charges. In gist, Yang is alleged to have touched the Victim’s vaginal area with his mouth on 21 April 2017. She was at the time five years old.

53     I agreed with the State’s submission that Yang’s alleged conduct would give rise to the following offences under Singapore law:

> (a)     Sexual exploitation of a child[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) by committing an obscene or indecent act with her under Section 7(_a_) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“CYPA offence”); and

> (b)     Outrage of modesty of a person under 14 years old under Section 354(2) Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“OM offence”).

54     It was clear to me that Yang’s alleged conduct of touching the Victim’s vaginal area with his mouth would amount to an obscene or indecent act in relation to the CYPA offence and criminal force in relation to the OM offence. Further in relation to the OM offence, Yang’s intention to outrage the modesty of the Victim could be inferred from his alleged conduct. There was no conceivable reason for him to touch the Victim in that manner and at that location.

55     I also agreed with the State that the foregoing offences against Singapore law would fall to be “indecent assaults” as listed at paragraph 8, Part 1, First Schedule of the Act. In the premises, both these alleged offences fell to be “extradition crimes” as defined by s 2 of the Act.

### Count Two

56     Count Two was for the offence of ‘Lewd act upon a child’ in violation of Section 288(a) of the California Penal Code. In respect of this charge, Yang was alleged to have touched the Victim’s vaginal area with his finger on 21 April 2017.

57     The State submitted that Yang’s conduct would constitute an offence of sexual assault involving penetration of a victim under 14 (digital-vaginal penetration) under s 376(2)(_a_) punishable under s 376(4)(_b_) Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). I disagreed. In my judgment, Yang’s alleged conduct of touching the Victim’s vaginal area with his finger would not amount to penetration, which is required to constitute an offence under s 376(2)(_a_) Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

58     Nevertheless, I found that Yang’s alleged conduct of touching the Victim’s vaginal area with his finger would clearly give rise to a CYPA offence and an OM offence for the reasons previously elucidated (at \[54\] _supra_). As I also held above, these offences would fall to be “indecent assaults” under the First Schedule of the Act. In the premises, this alleged offence too fell to be an “extradition crime”.

59     In the premises, I found that Yang was a fugitive accused of committing offences in the US which fell to be extradition crimes as defined in s 2 of the Act.

## Whether the alleged offences fall to be offences for which extradition shall be reciprocally granted under the Treaty

60     Article 3 of the Treaty lists the categories crimes and offences for which extradition shall be reciprocally granted by the US and Singapore (hereinafter be referred to as “extraditable offences”).

61     The question to be determined was whether the fugitive’s alleged conduct, if it had taken place in Singapore, would have constituted a crime falling within one or more of the categories of extraditable offences (see _Wong Yuh Lan_ at \[36\]). In this regard, the State submitted that Yang’s conduct if it had taken place in Singapore, would have constituted a crime falling within the category of extraditable offences described at paragraph 6 of Article 3, which states “\[i\]ndecent assault _if such crime or offence be indictable in the place where the accused or convicted person is apprehended_”. As I earlier found, the offences against Singapore law that would have been made out by Yang’s conduct would fall to be indecent assaults (at \[55\] and \[58\] _supra_). However, the question remained as to how the rest of the description, as italicised above, ought to be interpreted.

62     As a starting point, two important principles ought to be borne in mind when interpreting provisions of extradition treaties (see _Government of Belgium v Postlethwaite and Others_ <span class="citation">\[1988\] 1 AC 924</span> (“_Postlethwaite_”) at 946H – 947D):

> (a)     First, the court unless constrained by the language used, should not interpret the extradition treaty in a way that would hinder the working and narrow the operation of the most salutary international arrangements.

> (b)     Second, an extradition treaty is a contract between two sovereign States and must be construed as such. The reciprocal rights and obligations which the contracting parties confer and accept are intended to serve the purpose of bringing to justice those guilty of crimes committed in either of the contracting parties.

63     In my judgment, the term “indictable” ought to be construed in light of the _requested State’s_ domestic laws prevailing at the date of the fugitive’s alleged crime or offence. This is apparent from the express wording of paragraph 6, which states that the crime or offence be indictable “_in the place where the accused or convicted person is apprehended_”. Such place must necessarily refer to the requested State.

64     My view was fortified by the fact that the original contracting parties, the US and the UK, had different domestic legal criteria for when offences fell to be indictable. In the US, an indictable offence is one where it is proper or necessary to be prosecuted by the process of indictment, which in turn means presenting evidence before a grand jury for the grand jury to determine whether there is adequate basis for bringing criminal charges against a suspected criminal actor (see _Black’s Law Dictionary, 2nd Ed_). In _Hurtado v People of California_ 110 U.S. 516 (1884), the US Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution to require the federal government to use grand juries for all felony crimes, _i.e._, crimes carrying a penalty of more than one year’s imprisonment (see 18 U.S. Code section 3559), whereas for state prosecutions, this will vary according to the respective state’s laws. In the UK, whether an offence is indictable (_i.e._, triable on indictment), as opposed to a summary offence (_i.e._, triable only summarily) would, where it is a statutory offence, depend on the specific statute (see for example the Sexual Offences Act 1956), and where the offence is a common law offence, case law (e.g., murder and manslaughter). The use of the grand jury in the UK had further been made redundant by the development of committal proceedings in the magistrate’s court to commit an accused to trial (see the Indictable Offences Act 1848 (11 & 12 Vict. c.42)).[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) It can thus be inferred that in the absence of a shared or common criteria of “indictable offences”, the parties had instead contracted to have the requested State’s domestic laws apply.

65     I was further of the view that the contracting parties did not intend to limit the category of indecent assault offences to those indictable at the time the Treaty was entered. Paragraph 6 of Article 3 is framed with some generality and does not refer to specific domestic statutes or to laws in force at the time the Treaty was entered. In this regard, the Treaty is distinguishable from statutes like the Extradition Acts 1873 where specific reference was made, for example, to specific statues like the Larceny Act 1861 and later the Theft Act 1968 (see _Regina v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Gilmore; Regina v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex parte Ogun_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] QB 611</span>). Having intended that “indictable offence” be determined in accordance with the domestic laws of the requested State, the contracting parties would have been alive to how their respective domestic laws could change over time as the Treaty continued. In the premises, the contracting parties must be presumed to have intended that the indecent assaults indictable in the requested State evolve along with the requested State’s domestic laws (see _Dispute regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v Nicaragua)_ (2009) at \[66\]). To interpret it otherwise would be to unduly narrow the operation of the Treaty (see _Postlethwaite_ cited at \[62\] _supra_).

66     As mentioned above, following our independence, Singapore and the US confirmed on 10 June 1969 by exchange of letters, that the Treaty would continue to have full force and effect between both States on the same terms (at \[5\] _supra_). This must mean that the contracting parties had agreed for the term “crime or offence be indictable” in paragraph 6 be construed in the light of their respective domestic laws. Had they intended otherwise, they would have amended the Treaty or made provision by way of a supplementary treaty.

67     Further lending support to my view, the contracting parties would have been aware at the time of the exchange of letters (and indeed to date) that Singapore did not have a concept of indictable offences. Although we had adopted a committal hearing procedure for the committal of cases for trial in the High Court,[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) there was no categorisation of offences into indicatable or summary offences. Rather, _all_ offences under our Penal Code and any other law were triable by the High Court.[^13] Whether an offence was also triable in the District and/or Magistrate Courts would then depend on amongst other things, express provision in statute, the maximum term of imprisonment the offence attracts and authorisation by the Prosecution to have an offence triable only by a District Court be tried in the Magistrate’s Court.[^14] The committal of cases for trial in the High Court was also heard by a Magistrate and not a jury.[^15]

68     It cannot be the case that in the absence of “indictable offences” in Singapore, parties therefore intended that conduct constituting crimes or offences of indecent assault in Singapore would never fall to be extraditable crimes under Article 3 of the Treaty. This would be a plainly illogical outcome that defeats the purpose of the Treaty. In my judgment, a more reasonable construction of “crime or offence indictable” in the context of our laws relating to crime and criminal procedure would be that the offence is triable in Singapore. I therefore found that the offences against Singapore law that would have been made out by Yang’s conduct would fall within the description at paragraph 6, Article 3 of the Treaty.

## Sufficiency of evidence

69     It bears reiterating that the Court’s role in these proceedings was not to determine Yang’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but simply to enquire whether a _prima facie_ case had been made out against him by credible evidence (see _John Muhia Kangu v Director of Prisons_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[25\]). A _prima facie_ case is made out where there is some evidence that is not inherently incredible, which, if unrebutted, would prove each and every element of the offence that a person is charged with (see _Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor_ \[1981-1982\] SLR(R) 133 at \[16\] and _In the Matter of Kumar Krishna Pillai_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 107</span> at \[56\]).

70     As the Court held in _Chua Han Mow v Superintendent of Pudu Prison_ <span class="citation">\[1979\] 2 MLJ 70</span>, it is not the Magistrate’s duty to consider possible lines of defence to the charge which may be raised or decide whether there are sufficient grounds for convicting the fugitive. That is the function of the trial court. Likewise, the task of resolving doubt as to the weight or quality of the evidence and assessing the evidence should be left to the trial court.

71     The State’s evidence comprised of affidavits from Detective Crystal Duerr,[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) which contained _inter alia_, the videos[^17] and transcripts of the forensic interviews conducted with the Victim[^18] as well as her sister[^19], who was at the scene of the alleged offences as well as other evidence seeking to establish Yang’s identity as the perpetrator of the alleged offences. The Victim[^20] and her sister[^21] also provided declarations confirming that the contents of the forensic interviews conducted were an accurate account of the events that had transpired on 21 April 2017. Also adduced were declarations from their parents detailing the events leading up to the alleged offences and how the alleged offences were uncovered[^22].

72     The foregoing affidavits and declarations were sworn and certified before an officer of the US, Ms Melissa C Diaz, Deputy District Attorney, San Diego County District Attorney’s Officer, and this was confirmed in Ms Diaz’s affidavit that was sworn before a judge of the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego. In the premises, the affidavits and declarations were duly authenticated overseas documents and accordingly admitted into evidence under s 42 of the Act.

73     The State’s evidence against Yang can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     The Victim’s mother stated that on 21 April 2017, she had brought her two daughters, the Victim and her sister, to church for a wedding rehearsal.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) She informed that she had met one Tracie Yang (“Tracie”) and an older male who Tracie had introduced as her father.[^24] She described the older male as being Asian, approximately 50-60 years old at that time, standing five feet and between five and seven inches tall, and weighing between about 150 and 160 pounds with brown hair and possibly wearing glasses.[^25] She further stated that when rehearsals started, the said older male had been left alone with the Victim and her sister in the upstairs loft of the church.[^26]

> (b)     Tracie confirmed with Detective Duerr through a phone interview that she had been at the aforesaid rehearsal[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) but claimed that her father, one Pian He Yang was walking around the campus (on which the church was located) during the rehearsal[^28].

> (c)     The Victim informed that she and her sister had accompanied their mother to church for practice and had met a man and a girl there.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) She described the man as having brown hair, wearing glasses and “kinda a little old”.[^30] The Victim stated that after her mother had gone downstairs for practice, the man had asked her to go over to a “corner that no one can see”.[^31] There, he had asked her to lie down and then pulled down her pants and underpants.[^32] She informed that he then touched her “private”, where she “pee down” and his hand had moved “up and down”.[^33] She demonstrated this to the forensic interviewer by pointing to her vaginal area and moving her finger in an up and down motion.[^34] The Victim also informed that the man had licked at her “private”.[^35] He then stopped and told the Victim to “keep this to you and me”.[^36]

> (d)     The Victim’s sister stated that after her mother had gone downstairs for practice with the other woman, the Victim and her were left upstairs with a man.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) She described the man as having brown hair, tan skin, wearing glasses and old.[^38] She informed that she was watching something on her iPad with her headphones on and had seen the man speaking to the Victim when she glanced up briefly before looking away.[^39]

> (e)     The Victim’s father informed that on 21 May 2017, the Victim had informed him she had met a man and another woman with her mother at a music rehearsal in church.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40) She further informed that when her mother went downstairs for practice, the man had asked her to lie down and proceeded to touch and lick her privates and told her not to say anything.[^41] He stated that the word “privates” referred to genitals as this was how they were described at home.[^42]

74     Yang chose to give evidence. In gist, he did not dispute that he was present at the scene of the alleged offences and that he had interacted with the Victim.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) However, he denied that any of the alleged acts had occurred. According to him, the Victim had approached him, and he had lifted her up by holding onto her armpits.[^44] When he did that, her belly button was exposed and he “blew air on her tummy” to “make her laugh”.[^45] He further alleged that the Victim’s evidence may have been influenced or manipulated by her parents and/or the prosecutor.[^46]

75     I was satisfied that a _prima facie_ case had been made out against Yang in respect of the identified offences. The State had adduced evidence, that was not inherently incredible, to support the allegation that Yang had touched the Victim’s vaginal area with his mouth and his finger. As mentioned above, such conduct would amount to an obscene or indecent act as well as criminal force. Yang’s intention to outrage the modesty of the Victim could be inferred from the same. There was nothing in Yang’s evidence that gave this Court reasonable basis to find that the evidence adduced by the State was inherently incredible. As I emphasised to Yang at the hearing, he remains free to pursue his defence at trial, which will be the appropriate forum to test the credibility of the witnesses and assess the quality of the evidence against him.

## Conclusion

76     For completeness, I found that the grounds preventing the surrender of a fugitive under s 7 of the Act and Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Treaty did not apply in the present case and that there were no other legal grounds preventing Yang’s surrender. Yang also did not seek to argue as such.

77     In conclusion, I found that Yang was liable to be surrendered to the US in respect of all three charges for which his extradition had been sought and committed him accordingly to prison to await the warrant of the Minister for his surrender.
