Tort – Negligence – Duty of care

Tort – Breach of duty

6 November 2020

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The plaintiff, Heng Siam Yong (“Heng”), was injured when he fell off a cement tanker (“Tanker”) owned and operated by the first defendant, Ready Transport Pte Ltd (“Ready”). The fall, on 17 December 2015, occurred at the premises of the second defendant, Nanyang Cement Pte Ltd (“Nanyang”). The material portion of Nanyang’s premises comprised a cement terminal (“Terminal”).

2       Heng commenced this action against Ready and Nanyang, seeking damages in relation to the personal injuries suffered from the fall. This was a bifurcated trial, and only the issue of liability was before me. After hearing all the evidence and considering the closing submissions from all parties, I found in favour of Heng. I found that Ready and Nanyang were liable to Heng for the injuries and loss suffered, and therefore, Interlocutory Judgment was entered in favour of Heng against Ready and Nanyang, with damages to be assessed by the Registrar. I found that Heng had not been contributorily negligent. As between Ready and Nanyang inter se, I found that each would be liable to the extent of 50%. Both Ready and Nanyang have appealed.

3       At the material time, Heng was employed by Ready. Heng’s duties were to drive and operate the Tanker. Nanyang was, at the material time, the occupier of the Terminal. Ready is described as “a company in the business of freight transport”, including “cement transportation services”. Nanyang is described as a company (then) “in the business of cement terminal operations and trading cement”. At the material time, Nanyang had engaged Ready to “load, transport and deliver cement from the (Terminal) to various designated locations in Singapore as instructed by (Nanyang)”. Heng was assigned (to drive and operate the Tanker) for this task.

4       On 17 December 2015 (the “material day”), Heng was instructed to load the Tanker with cement at the Terminal. The Statement of Claim (“SOC”) pleads that once Heng was at the Terminal, “he commenced his usual routine of climbing to the top of the (Tanker) … to reach the cement loader. … There was no guard rail around the cement loader. After loading cement into the (Tanker), (Heng) had to tighten the cover at the top of the (Tanker) by turning it.”

5       The SOC goes on to state, that while Heng “was turning the cover, he lost his grip and fell to the ground” and suffered injuries. Heng further averred in the SOC that a member of Nanyang’s staff had instructed Heng to “adopt the method described … to load cement into the (Tanker)” and that this method was “common practice at the (Terminal) adopted by (Heng) and his co-workers”. The SOC further stated that “there are guard rails around the cement loaders at other cement terminals to prevent workers from falling off their tankers”.

6       In the plaintiff’s closing submissions, Heng’s solicitors highlighted the following facts that were not in dispute. Just immediately before the fall on the material day, Heng was working on top of the Tanker at the loading bay at the Terminal. There were no guard rails installed at the loading bay at the Terminal. Safety harnesses had not been issued to Heng and other tanker drivers by Ready and/or Nanyang. Heng had not undergone any training relating to working at heights. Heng had “lost his grip of the handle while closing and/or tightening the metal hatch cover and fell from the (Tanker) top”. Nanyang “installed metal guardrails on the ceiling of their loading bay after (the material day)”.

7       In the Defence filed by Ready, Ready sought to deny liability for the fall suffered by Heng (the “Fall”). In the alternative, Ready averred that it was the negligence of Nanyang and/or Heng which led to the Fall. With regard to Heng’s averment with regard to the absence of guardrails at the Terminal, Ready pleaded that it (Ready), being a “small company”, “was in no position to take issue with the safety measures, equipment, features and/or facilities provided and/or not provided by (Nanyang) at the (Terminal), especially when there were other bigger companies similarly utilising the (Terminal) without complaint. As such, (Ready) had no choice but to abide by (Nanyang’s) system of work, accept the safety measures, equipment, features and/or facilities provided and/or not provided by (Nanyang) at the (Terminal)”. Ready further pleaded that it “was not a mandatory requirement under any rules and regulations for there to be guard rails around the cement loaders at cement terminals”.

8       Ready averred that it had supplied Heng “the necessary Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”)” which consisted of helmet, safety boots and safety gloves. Ready did not supply Heng with any safety belt, to be used in conjunction with a safety harness and lanyard.

9       Nanyang, in its Defence, similarly sought to deny liability for the Fall. In the alternative, Nanyang pleaded that the Fall was caused by the negligence of Heng and/or Ready. Of note is Nanyang’s averment regarding the presence of an anchorage point. Nanyang averred that there “was also an anchorage point installed above the loading bay where the alleged accident took place for workers to anchor their safety harnesses and/or safety lifelines while on top of the cement tanker”. Nanyang lay the blame for the non-issuance of a safety harness to Heng, squarely on Ready, as Heng’s employers.

10     There was no doubt that both Ready and Nanyang owed Heng a duty of care. I found that the Fall had been caused by the interplay of the factors, dealt with in the following paragraphs. Perhaps the most compelling and proximate reason for the Fall had been the absence of guard rails at the Terminal.

11     Nanyang had earlier identified, by a Risk Assessment done in December 2013, that such guard rails would act as an “Additional Risk Control” in the prevention of falls from height (in particular where a tanker driver/operator was working atop a cement tanker). There were no guard rails in place on the material day. Nanyang installed guard rails only after the Fall had occurred. This was obviously too late for Heng. The evidence showed that other cement terminals had such guard rails installed for safety reasons, to eliminate or minimise the risks of driver operators falling from atop cement tankers. A simple, hypothetical example illustrates the importance of such guard rails. Suppose a driver operator standing atop a cement tanker were to suddenly suffer a fainting spell. If there was no fall arrest system in place, there was a very strong likelihood that the fainting driver would fall off from the top of the cement tanker. Guard rails would serve to prevent such falls from occurring (in instances where there was no proper, effective fall arrest system in place).

12     The next factor to be considered was the lack of a proper fall arrest system, coupled with the non-issuance of safety belts, safety harnesses and lanyards. It was apparent that a proper, working fall arrest system was necessary in the circumstances. The height of the Tanker was 3.38 metres. Simply put, there was no proper fall arrest system in place at the Terminal. A point of contention was the presence or otherwise of sufficient anchorage points. As stated in \[9\], Nanyang had pleaded that there had been “an anchorage point installed above the loading bay” (with emphasis on the singular nature of this alleged anchorage point).

13     In the Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) of Goh Peng Liang (a witness called by Nanyang, who was the Operations Executive of Nanyang at the material time), it is clearly stated that “(above) the loading bay next to the cement loading sprout, there is a ready anchorage point for cement truck drivers to anchor their safety harnesses and/or safety lifelines while they are working on top of their cement trucks”. A photograph of the alleged anchorage point is exhibited to the AEIC. The photograph purports to show an “Anchorage Point” made of “13 mm diameter Rebar welded to the Beam and Angle Bar” (as per the caption).The photograph on its own does not show its location in relation to the loading bay and where it would be situated vis-à-vis a cement tanker and the cement tanker operator working atop the cement tanker.

14     Nanyang’s case on this point took a dramatic turn on 10 February 2020, the sixth day of hearing. With the admission of the AEIC of Lee Hon Yew (another witness called by Nanyang, who was the Plant Manager of Nanyang at the material time), Nanyang’s position was now that there were “multiple anchorage points”. Lee Hon Yew’s AEIC had been affirmed only on 7 February 2020. I accepted the submission of Heng’s Counsel that a party should be bound by its (in this case, unamended) pleading. Whereas the Defence filed by Nanyang and the AEIC of Goh Peng Liang had made reference to a singular alleged anchorage point, it was not now open to Nanyang to allege (especially at this late stage of the proceedings, and when the Defence remained unamended on this point) the presence of “multiple anchorage points”.

15     Upon a consideration of all the evidence, especially that of Heng and Tan Guan Chai (an ex-colleague of Heng’s who was present at the Terminal at the time of the Fall), I was satisfied that there had not been in place at the Terminal, at the time of the Fall, any semblance of a proper, workable fall arrest system. The evidence strongly suggested that the illustrated (alleged) “Anchorage Point” was not meant to be any part of a fall arrest system or an anchorage point for attaching safety lanyards attached to safety harnesses. More importantly, Nanyang’s defence on this point fails for a more fundamental reason to be dealt with later.

16     It was not open for Ready to deny liability for the reasons they put forth. Tellingly, they did not supply Heng with a safety belt, safety harness and lanyard as part of his PPE. It would have been obvious to Ready that Heng would have to routinely work atop the Tanker. As Heng’s employers, it was simply remiss of Ready not to supply such obviously necessary pieces of equipment to Heng. Ready could not rely on the reason of comparative commercial weakness to absolve themselves of blame in this particular regard. As employers, Ready had to bear in mind that when they contracted with parties such as Nanyang, they were supplying both equipment and labour. Both the Tanker and Heng were sent to Nanyang. As employer, Ready had the duty to ensure that Heng could work safely, first on the primary “worksite”, which was the Tanker. Ready thus had an obligation to supply the necessary safety equipment for working at height. Ready had failed to supply these items. It was not an excuse for Ready to say that these items of equipment would have been of no use at the Terminal. Ready would have the secondary obligation of ensuring that where Heng was sent to, also had features that would ensure his safety when working at height. The safety element had to outweigh the economic demands in this particular case.

17     At the Terminal, there was simply no fall arrest system, of even a rudimentary nature. The evidence strongly suggested that parties, and Nanyang in particular, were content on relying on good fortune in the hope that no mishap would occur. From the evidence, I found that there were no suitable anchorage points towards a provision of a fall arrest system. What was further strong indication of this lackadaisical state of affairs was that Nanyang itself did not provide Heng with safety equipment such as safety belt, safety harness and lanyard, content as it were, to rest solely on the obligation of the respective employers to provide such equipment. Coupled with the absence of protective guard rails, it was clear to see how dangerous the Terminal had been, in particular on the material day.

18     Nanyang should have been alive to the dangerous nature of the Terminal at the material time, and it was incumbent on them to ensure that there was a suitable, working fall arrest system. This system had to be complete: supplying sufficient anchorage points was not enough, Nanyang had to ensure that all who came to work at the Terminal were fully equipped. A system would not work without all its component parts. Where such workers arrived without the requisite safety equipment, Nanyang ought to have either disallowed access to dangerous heights, or have supplied the requisite safety equipment themselves, to ensure the safety of all who worked at height, at the Terminal.

19     Thus, both Ready and Nanyang had to be found liable. Ready were obligated, as employer, to provide Heng with the requisite items of PPE to have made working at height, safe. They also had the secondary obligation, as employers, to ensure that where they assigned Heng to work as, was safe as well. In this regard, it is pertinent to point out that the Tanker formed part of the “worksite” environment that Heng had to work at, whilst he was at the Terminal. Being the owner and supplier of the Tanker, Ready could not completely pass the responsibility of ensuring Heng’s safety to Nanyang. Ready still had to ensure a “safe system of work” whilst Heng was atop the Tanker.

20     Nanyang could not rely on Ready’s non-issuance of the requisite safety equipment to absolve itself of blame for the Fall. The absence of the guard rails and the absence of a proper and complete fall arrest system were causative factors in the Fall.

21     Both Ready and Nanyang had also pleaded that Heng had been contributorily negligent. It was my finding, that Heng had shown, on a balance of probabilities, that he had not been contributorily negligent. In this regard, I carefully considered the evidence of Heng and of Tan Guan Chai (who had witnessed the physical fall of Heng from atop the Tanker). I was satisfied that the evidence was insufficient to show that Heng had been contributorily negligent in any way. He had simply lost his grip whilst closing or tightening the metal hatch cover in the circumstances that did not suggest a lack of care on his part. The theories put forth by Ready and Nanyang as to the causes of the Fall were speculative at best, and were unsupported by expert evidence of an accident reconstructionist. Tan Guan Chai had only witnessed the actual fall but not the mechanics leading up to the Fall.

22     For these reasons, I found that Heng had proven his claim against Ready and Nanyang on a balance of probabilities. Both Ready and Nanyang had breached their respective duties of care owed to Heng, and were thus liable to Heng. There would be Interlocutory Judgment in Heng’s favour against Ready and Nanyang, for damages to be assessed by the Registrar. Costs for the trial on liability to be reserved till after the Assessment of Damages, and such costs to be agreed, or to be taxed by me. As between Ready and Nanyang inter se, each would be liable to the extent of 50% of the damages assessed. In this regard, both Ready and Nanyang had been negligent to significant and material degrees, as stated above. I found that it was appropriate in the circumstances to “apportion” the blame between Ready and Nanyang, inter se, in the ratio as stated.
