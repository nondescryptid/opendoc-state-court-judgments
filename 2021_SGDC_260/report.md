### District Judge Melissa Tan:

1       The Accused is a 50-year-old male Singapore citizen. He pleaded guilty to one charge of assisting an unlicensed moneylender in carrying on the business of moneylending in contravention of s 5(1) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”), an offence punishable under s 14(1)(_b_)(i) read with s 14(1A)(_a_) of the MLA. He was liable under s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (“PA”) for an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 495 days for breaching the basic condition of his remission order.

2       The Accused was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment, the mandatory minimum fine of $30,000 (in default four weeks’ imprisonment) and an enhanced sentence of 30 days’ imprisonment.

3       Dissatisfied, the Accused lodged an appeal against the sentence. The Accused has not paid the fine of $30,000 and is currently serving his sentence.

## The charge

4       The charge states as follows:

> You … are charged that you, on 4 March 2021, at about 5.30pm, at Block 676 Woodlands Drive 71, Singapore, did assist an unlicensed moneylender known only as “Bro”, in carrying on of the business of moneylending, to wit, by collecting one DBS Bank Visa Card bearing number \[xxx\] from Ria Natreesha Binte Rosli, which card was intended for use by the said “Bro” to facilitate his moneylending business, when he was not an excluded moneylender or an exempt moneylender or authorised by licence to carry on the business of moneylending, and you have thereby assisted in the contravention of Section 5(1) of the Moneylenders Act (Chapter 188, Rev. Ed. 2010) and committed an offence punishable under Section 14(1)(b)(i) read with Section 14(1A) (a) of the said Act.

> And further that you, from 12 November 2020 to 11 July 2022, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev. Ed. 2000) (“PA”) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the PA. While the remission order is in effect you, on 4 March 2021, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the PA, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the PA with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 495 days from 4 March 2021 to 11 July 2022 for that offence.

## Facts

5       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification. The salient facts are summarised below.

6       At the material time, the Accused was working as a delivery man. Sometime in late 2020, faced with financial difficulties, the Accused took a loan from an unlicensed moneylender known as “Bro”. When he failed to keep up with the payments, he claimed that “Bro” harassed and threatened him.

7       In early March 2021, “Bro” offered to offset $500 from his outstanding debt if the Accused assisted “Bro” to collect a bank card from another debtor. The Accused agreed to do so despite knowing that “Bro” was not an excluded moneylender, an exempt moneylender or authorised by licence to carry on the business moneylending.

8       On 4 March 2021, acting on the instructions of “Bro”, the Accused met Ria Natreesha Binte Rosli (“the debtor”) to collect her bank card. He knew that the card was intended to be used by “Bro” to facilitate the unlicensed moneylending business.

9       The Accused was unaware that the debtor had earlier lodged a police report in relation to harassment by unlicensed moneylenders. When the debtor was told to hand over the bank card, she informed the Police who in turn instructed her to do so. Shortly after the Accused collected the bank card from the debtor, the police arrested him.

10     The Accused was subject to a remission order from 12 November 2020 to 11 July 2022. As this offence was committed on 4 March 2021 while the remission order was in effect, he was liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(_a_) of the PA with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 495 days.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed penalties

11     The offence of assisting an unlicensed moneylender under s 14(1)(_b_)(i) of the MLA is punishable with a fine of not less than $30,000 and not more than $300,000 and with imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years.

12     Section 14(1A)(_a_) of the MLA provides that subject to ss 325(1) and 330 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), a first-time offender under s 14(1) of the MLA shall also be liable to punishment with not more than six strokes of caning.

### Antecedents

13     The Accused was traced for unrelated property, drug consumption and traffic offences. He has also been placed in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre and under drug supervision for six instances of drug consumption.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

14     The Prosecution sought a sentence of one to three months’ imprisonment and a fine of $30,000 and an enhanced sentence at the lower end of the Band 1 sentencing range (up to one-third of the maximum enhanced sentence) laid down by the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span> (“_Abdul Mutalib_”).

15     With respect to the enhanced sentence, the Prosecution submitted that the severity of the breach of the basic condition of his remission order was of a low level. The Prosecution’s analysis was as follows:

> (a)     the offence of assisting an unlicensed moneylender was of moderate gravity; and

> (b)     in respect of his rehabilitative potential, the Accused reoffended three months into his remission order and his fresh offence was dissimilar to the offence for which he was placed on the conditional remission scheme (namely, LT1 consumption).

16     The Prosecution also cited _Abdul Mutalib_ for the proposition that the enhanced sentence to be imposed “should ordinarily not exceed the underlying sentence imposed for the fresh sentence” (at \[55\]).

### Mitigation

17     The Accused was unrepresented. He said that when he first obtained the loan from “Bro”, he thought “Bro” was a licensed moneylender. However, the Accused subsequently realised that “Bro” was an unlicensed moneylender when “Bro” started to threaten him by posting photographs of his grandchildren, children and wife on social media as soon as he was unable to repay the loan. Apart from being instructed to collect the bank card, he said that “Bro” had asked him to carry out transactions but the Accused refused to do so because he knew of other accused persons who committed such offences.

18     The Accused said that he was allowed to stay at Jamiyah Home upon his most recent release from prison. There, he assisted others with their problems and did maintenance work. During the period when he was subject to the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme, his personal supervisor from Prisons informed him that he did not have problems with the Accused’s attitude or conduct in prison. The Accused also worked at Jamiyah Nursing Home.

19     The Accused also raised his personal circumstances. The Accused said that he found a job and stayed at home upon release from Jamiyah Home. He mentioned that his son committed several regulatory offences and that he encouraged his son to surrender. He was in the process of paying the forfeited sum he was ordered to pay as his son’s surety. He further claimed that his son faced bankruptcy owing to hire purchase agreements for items that the Accused wanted.

20     He urged the court to impose a light sentence because he now had grandchildren and wanted to change.

### Decision on Sentence

21     The court in _Public Prosecutor v Luciana Lim Ying Ying_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 257</span> observed that “\[s\]entences for passive assistance by way of handing an ATM card or opening a bank account have generally ranged between two weeks’ to \[_sic_\] two months’ imprisonment and the minimum fine, with the norm being one month’s imprisonment” (at \[57\]).

22     In the present case, the Accused assisted the unlicensed moneylender to collect a bank card from another debtor. In my view, this form of assistance is passive and similar to the act of handing over one’s own ATM card to the unlicensed moneylender’s runner. There were no aggravating factors or exceptional mitigating factors that warranted departure from the usual sentencing norm. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment and the mandatory minimum fine of $30,000 (in default four weeks’ imprisonment) for the principal MLA offence.

23     I next turn to consider the enhanced sentence. I was of the view that an enhanced sentence was warranted because the MLA offence was a relatively serious offence. This is reflected by the mandatory minimum fine of $30,000 that was prescribed as punishment. In determining the appropriate length of the enhanced sentence, I applied the sentencing framework laid down in _Abdul Mutalib_.

24     At the first step, I considered the gravity of the fresh offence, his rehabilitative prospects and all other relevant circumstances. Having regard to the underlying sentence imposed, I assessed the gravity of the offence to be on the lower end of moderate. Given the dissimilarity of his present offence to the offence for which he was on remission (_ie_, offence of consumption of specified drugs under s 8(_b_)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)), the fact that he was re-employed, as well as the fact that he reoffended four months after release, I was of the view that he had fair prospects of rehabilitation.

25     At the second step, I determined that the case was of low severity and fell within the lower end of Band 1 of the sentencing bands. I considered that an enhanced sentence of 49 of 495 days was appropriate. However, I am mindful that save for exceptional situations, the enhanced sentence should not exceed the underlying sentence imposed for the fresh offence (_Abdul Mutalib_ at \[55\]). Accordingly, I have calibrated the enhanced sentence downwards to 30 days’ imprisonment.

26     Taking a last look at the facts and circumstances of the case, I was satisfied that the aggregate sentence of one month’s imprisonment and fine of $30,000 (in default four weeks’ imprisonment) and an enhanced sentence of 30 days’ imprisonment is neither crushing nor not keeping with the Accused’s past record and future prospects. I was of the view that the aggregate sentence imposed was appropriate given the overall criminality.
