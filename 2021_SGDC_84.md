### District Judge Edgar Foo:

## Introduction

1       Mr Zhai Huilu (“the Accused”), a 38-year-old male Chinese National had claimed trial to the following charge:

DAC 937281-2017 (Amended)

> You … are charged that you, on 14 October 2017, at about 10.30 a.m., at the common corridor on the 20th floor of Block 448A Bukit Batok West Avenue 9, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Islam Mohammad Ariful, by means of a cement scraper, an instrument which used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death, _to wit_, by hitting him once on the mouth with the cement scraper, causing him to suffer a deep laceration on the right upper lip, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 324 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

### Punishment prescribed by law

2       The punishment prescribed under section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

3       At the conclusion of the trial on 5 January 2021, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of the charge. On 3 February 2021, after considering the Prosecution’s submission on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea, I imposed a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment on the Accused.

4       The Accused, being dissatisfied with my decision, had filed his Notice of Appeal against my conviction and sentence. I hereby set out my reasons for my conviction and sentence.

## Parties’ evidence and exhibits

### Prosecution’s evidence and exhibits

5       The Prosecution had called a total of 8 witnesses in their case against the Accused:

8       The Prosecution’s evidence could be summarised as follows: -

#### PW1 – Sng Song Hoong

9       PW1 was employed by China Construction South Pacific Development Co. Pte Ltd as a construction safety coordinator[^1]. On 14 October 2017, PW1 was the safety coordinator in charge of the construction site building HDB flats at Bukit Batok West Avenue 8[^2]. Block 448A was one of the HDB blocks which was part in the construction site[^3]. PW1 testified that he was informed by someone that there was a case of fighting between workers at the construction site and he was asked by his manager to call the police[^4]. PW1 was at the canteen of the construction site when he made the telephone call to the police[^5]. Exhibit P1 was the First Information Report made by PW1 to the police[^6].

10     After PW1 had called the police, he waited for the police to arrive[^7]. While waiting for the police to arrive PW1 saw both the Accused and the victim, PW6[^8]. They were both in the canteen and they were standing at different corners of the canteen[^9]. PW1 did not know who PW6 was but he recognised the Accused as an employee of Tian Di Engineering Pte Ltd and Tian Di Engineering Pte Ltd was a subcontractor of China Construction South Pacific Development Co. Pte Ltd.

11     PW6 was covering his mouth and PW1 could see blood around his mouth area. PW6’s shirt was also stained with blood[^10]. PW1 also noticed some scratch marks on the Accused’s neck. PW1 was standing about one arm’s length away from the Accused when he saw the Accused’s injuries[^11]. PW1 was of the view that the injuries on the Accused were not very serious[^12]. PW1 also did not know how the Accused’s injuries were caused[^13].

12     After the police came, they called for an ambulance and PW6 was conveyed to the hospital by the ambulance[^14].

#### PW2 – Dr Kenric Fan Rui-Pin

13     PW2 was a medical doctor working at the Emergency Department at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital[^15] and he was the doctor who had prepared PW6’s medical report, Exhibit P2[^16]. PW2 confirmed that he had prepared Exhibit P2 using the hospital’s clinical notes on PW6[^17] and the doctor who had attended to PW6 was PW3[^18].

14     PW2 noted that paragraph 2 of Exhibit P2 had stated “Patient was involved in a fight at his workplace. His assailant used a cement scraper as a weapon and **inadvertently** sliced the patient’s upper lip. He was also punched in the face.”. PW2 clarified that he had accidentally typed the word “inadvertently” into Exhibit P2 and the word “inadvertently” was not supposed to be in Exhibit P2[^19]. PW2 also confirmed that other than the word “inadvertently”, there were no other errors in Exhibit P2[^20].

#### PW3 – Dr Lin Jingping

15     PW3 had been working as a doctor since 2008 and he was working at the Emergency Department of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on 14 October 2017[^21] and he had attended to PW6 at the Emergency Department on that day[^22].

16     PW6 had informed PW3 that he was involved in a fight and the assailant had used a cement scraper as a weapon and it had sliced his lip[^23]. PW3 confirmed that PW6 did not inform him that the injury to his lip was caused inadvertently or accidentally[^24]. PW6 also did not tell PW3 that he was attacked or assaulted save that he was involved in a fight[^25].

17     PW3 also explained that PW6 had complained of upper lip pain and tenderness above his right eye and he had examined PW6’s eye and found that the eye movements were normal. PW3 had also noted that there was a deep laceration on PW6’s right upper lip around the edge of the lip and he had cleaned up the wound before stitching up the wound[^26].

18     After treating PW6, PW3 discharged PW6 and prescribed him pain killers and medical leave. He also advised PW6 to follow up for wound care with a general practitioner[^27].

19     PW3 also testified that he had written in his case notes that the other party had used a cement scraper as a weapon, sliced PW6’s lips and punched his face. PW3 could not remember if the slicing and punching were part of one action or two separate actions[^28].

#### PW4 – SSSGT Mohammad Nur Azmi Bin Karim

20     PW4 was the first responding police officer to arrive at the scene. When PW4 arrived at the scene, he met up with PW1[^29]. PW1 informed him that the victim, PW6 was his worker and that PW6 had been assaulted by the Accused and he had suffered a cut in his lip[^30]. PW1 also informed PW4 that the fight was over a broom[^31].

21     PW4 then met up with the Accused and PW6. PW4 saw that PW6 had a cut to his upper lip. He took a photograph[^32] of PW6’s injury and he proceeded to call for an ambulance[^33]. PW4 also noted that both PW6 and the Accused had been separated by the time he saw them[^34]. PW4 spoke to PW6 and PW6 informed him that he was working on level 20 and doing some touch up work when he wanted to use his broom. PW6 could not find his broom and he saw the Accused with his broom. There was a scuffle between the 2 of them and PW6 got the injury as a result of the scuffle[^35]. PW6 also did not know where the Accused had obtained the metal object which he had used to hit PW6’s lip[^36].

22     PW4 tried to speak to the Accused but he was unable to do so because the Accused could not speak English. PW4 then decided to arrange for a Mandarin speaking officer, PW8, to speak to the Accused[^37]. Another police officer, ASP Paulus also spoke to the Accused[^38]. PW4 had observed visible scratches on the Accused’s neck but there was no bleeding[^39]. PW8 had asked the Accused how he had sustained his neck injury and the Accused had informed PW8 that he had sustained his injury during his scuffle with PW6[^40]. The Accused said that he had felt a knock on his head area during the scuffle, but he did not see, and he was not sure how he was injured[^41]. The Accused told PW8 that his injury was caused by PW6 during the struggle[^42]. PW4 also asked PW6 twice about the Accused’s injury but PW6 was reluctant to say anything[^43].

23     PW4 then made 2 trips to the scene of the incident – the first trip was to observe the scene and to look for witnesses and the second trip was to take photographs of the scene[^44] . PW4 also took photographs of tools, brooms and a scraper found at the scene, but he was not sure if these were the weapons used during the incident[^45].

24     When PW4 was at level 20 of Block 448A, he spoke to PW5 who had witnessed the incident between PW6 and the Accused[^46]. PW5 told PW4 that he had seen PW6 and the Accused scuffing with each other at the area shown in Exhibit P5(c). PW5 said that he saw both the Accused and PW6 scuffling with each other on the floor[^47]. After that, PW5 tried to separate both parties[^48]. PW4 also drew a sketch plan of the level 20 to show where the incident had taken place[^49].

25     PW4 also confirmed that he had made the decision to place the Accused under arrest before he went to the scene because he had established that an offence under section 324 had been committed by the Accused[^50]. However, PW4 was not the arresting officer and he was not sure exactly sure when the Accused was placed under arrest[^51].

#### PW5 – Chandrakasu Murugan

26     PW5 was an employee of Tian Di Engineering Pte Ltd and he worked in the same company as the Accused[^52]. PW5 testified that he was working on level 20 of Block 448A on 14 October 2017 and he was cleaning tiles in one of the units when he heard people quarrelling and verbal arguments[^53].

27     When PW5 came out of his unit, he saw the Accused and PW6 sprawled on the ground and fighting and struggling with each other in the area shown in Exhibit P5(c)[^54]. The other workers were trying to pull them apart[^55]. PW5 saw the Accused and PW6 holding each other in a hugging manner and rolling around on the ground[^56].

28     PW5 did not see the Accused slash PW6 nor did he see PW6 or anyone else strangle the Accused[^57]. PW5 also confirmed that he had seen the Accused using a scraper as part of his work to clean the corners of the tiles[^58].

#### PW6 – Islam Mohammad Ariful

29     PW6 was working for China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd[^59]. PW6 testified that he was working in unit #XXX on level 20 of Block 448A[^60] at about 10.30 am on the day of the incident and he was cleaning the interior of the unit. PW6 said that he was cleaning the glass, skirting on the flooring and the clothes hanger in the kitchen[^61]. As part of his work, PW6 needed to use a broom, rags and chemicals (thinners)[^62].

30     On the day in question, PW6 was cleaning unit #XXX with rag and thinners and he had left his broom belonging to his company outside the gate of unit #XXX[^63]. After PW6 had finished cleaning the unit, he wanted to use the broom to clean up the floor[^64]. PW6 tried to look for his broom but he was unable to locate the broom. PW6 then saw the Accused taking the broom away[^65]. PW6 went up to the Accused and asked the Accused to return his broom to him. Instead of returning the broom, the Accused told him the broom belonged to him[^66] and he refused to return the broom to PW6[^67]. PW6 told the Accused that the broom belonged to his company and that he had taken the broom from the company store[^68]. PW6 testified that he had called the Accused “Lao Da” in Mandarin when he first spoke to the Accused and he had subsequently spoken to the Accused in simple English and the Accused had replied to him in simple English[^69].

31     At that time, the Accused was holding the middle part of the broom with his left hand with the head of the broom facing downwards and he was holding a scraper in his right hand[^70]. The scraper was facing upwards[^71]. PW6 tried to take back the broom and he held on to the top and the bottom of the broom. The 2 of them then started tugging the broom back and forth[^72]. The 2 of them were trying to pull the broom towards themselves and they were facing each other and standing very close to each other when they were doing that. According to PW6, he and the Accused were standing less than 2 feet away from each other[^73] and their hands were not fully extended when they were pulling the broom towards themselves[^74].

32     Suddenly, the Accused pushed up his right hand towards PW6 and he hit PW6’s right upper lip with the scraper[^75]. PW6 testified that the speed that the Accused had pushed the scraper towards him was very fast[^76]. After the Accused had hit PW6 on his lip, PW6 saw that his lip was bleeding, and he realised that his lip had been cut by the scraper[^77].

33     When PW6 saw that his lip was bleeding, he released his left hand from the broom, and he used his left hand to hold/grab onto the Accused’s throat[^78]. PW6 confirmed that all his fingers had made contact with the Accused’s throat.[^79] PW6 said that he did not apply pressure on the Accused’s throat, and he had merely pushed the Accused. PW6 said that he had grabbed the Accused’s throat out of anger[^80]. PW6 was not sure who had caused the Accused’s injury, but he was of the view that he did not cause the injury to the Accused’s neck[^81]. PW6 also did not notice if the Accused had suffered any injury to his neck when he grabbed the Accused’s neck because he was concentrating on his own injury[^82]. A short while later, a few workers came and separated the 2 of them[^83]. PW6 recalled that he did inform PW4 that he had held onto the Accused’s throat and that the other workers had separated them[^84]. PW6 also said that both he and the Accused were standing during the altercation and both did not fall onto the ground during the altercation[^85].

34     After the incident, PW6 was brought by some of the workers to the canteen which was located next to their office[^86]. A short while later, the police arrived and PW6 was taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital by ambulance[^87]. At the hospital, PW6 was treated by PW3. PW6 told PW3 that he had suffered injury to his lip[^88]. He also informed PW3 that he was suffering from a headache on the right side of his temple at a spot above his right eyebrow[^89]. PW6 did not know what had caused the headache. When PW3 asked him if he was punched in his head, he told PW3 that he did not know[^90]. PW6 also testified that the bleeding on his lip had stopped by the time he saw PW3 and that the paramedic had helped to stop the bleeding earlier on[^91]. At the hospital, PW3 proceeded to give him an injection and stitched up his wound[^92].

35     Because of the incident, PW6 had to incur the following medical bills[^93]:

> (a)     A medical bill for $114.00 from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on 14 October 2017;

> (b)     A medical bill for $38.05 from Bukit Batok Polyclinic on 16 October 2017 to clean up his wound; and

> (c)     A medical bill for $31.00 from Bukit Batok Polyclinic on 21 October 2017 to clean up his wound.

36     In addition, PW6 was given 2 days medical leave by PW3 and he lost a total income of $26 per day ($19 for basic pay and $7 for overtime work) when he was on medical leave[^94].

37     PW6 also confirmed that he had never seen the Accused[^95] or PW5[^96] before the incident.

#### PW7 – SI Adrian Chua

38     PW7 was the investigation officer in charge of this matter. PW7 testified that PW4 was the first responding officer who had arrived at the scene and PW4 had contacted him and informed him that there was a fight between the Accused and PW6 and that they were tussling over a broom and PW6 was injured and he had suffered a deep cut on his upper lip. PW4 had also told PW7 that PW6 had claimed that the Accused had used a scraper on him and the Accused had denied hitting PW6 with the scraper[^97].

39     After the briefing by PW4, PW7 made the decision to arrest the Accused and he gave the instruction for the Accused to be arrested[^98]. SGT Ridwan and PW8 then proceeded to arrest the Accused and they brought him back to Jurong Police Division[^99].

40     However, before the Accused was brought back to Jurong Police Division, he complained of pain and he was sent to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital for a check-up[^100]. PW7 was not sure which part of the Accused’s body that he had complained of pain[^101]. However, the Accused sent to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital for treatment before he was brought back to Jurong Police Division[^102]. PW4 was the officer who had filed the arrest report[^103].

41     PW7 first saw the Accused at about 6 am on 15 October 2017. PW7 interviewed the Accused to find out what had happened. The Accused told PW7 that he had found a broom and he had taken the broom to use it. PW6 had called out to him and asked for the broom. The Accused also claimed that he did not understand what PW6 was saying. Thereafter, the Accused told PW7 that the two of them had tussled over the broom and PW6 had pushed the Accused and the Accused had responded by swinging his arm at PW6[^104]. The Accused told PW7 that he wanted to throw a punch at PW6 and that he had intended to cause hurt to PW6[^105]. At that point, the Accused was holding a scraper in his hand and the scraper had cut PW6’s lip[^106]. The Accused also told PW7 that he did not cut PW6’s lips on purpose[^107].

42     PW7 also testified that he did not notice any injuries on the Accused’s neck when he was interviewing the Accused. PW7 also confirmed that he did not ask the Accused about his injury when he was interviewing the Accused[^108].

43     After interviewing the Accused, PW7 proceeded to record the Accused’s cautioned statement (Exhibit P9) at 6.45 am on the same day[^109]. PW7 testified that the Accused was cooperative during the statement taking[^110].

44     PW7 clarified that when he recorded Exhibit P9 from the Accused, although the statement was recorded in English, he had spoken to the Accused in Mandarin and there was no interpreter present during the recording of the statement[^111]. PW7 had read the charge and explained the same to the Accused in Mandarin. After that, PW7 proceeded to ask the Accused if he understood the charge and the Accused nodded his head and said “Yes, I understand”[^112]. PW7 then went on to administer the Notice of Warning and explained the same to the Accused. PW7 testified that the Accused understood the warning before he signed the same[^113].

45     PW7 said that the Accused had informed him that he could write English and PW7 did tell the Accused that he could explain everything to PW7 in Mandarin and PW7 would translate what the Accused had told him to English and write it down in the English language in Exhibit P9[^114].

46     As for the statement taking for Exhibit P9, PW7 testified that he had spoken to the Accused in Mandarin and the Accused had also answered him in Mandarin. PW7 then proceeded to translate the Accused’s answers to English and he recorded the Accused’s statement in the English language[^115].

47     After PW7 had recorded the Accused’s statement, he then translated what he had recorded from English to Mandarin and he read the same back to the Accused in Mandarin. The Accused also went on to acknowledge his statement[^116]. After that, PW7 invited the Accused to make addition, correction and deletion to his statement. The Accused told PW7 that he had nothing else to say[^117].

48     PW7 clarified that during the recording of Exhibit P9, the Accused did not inform him that it was PW6 who had laid hand on the Accused first and had started to hit him first and that 4 other men had beaten him up. PW7 also confirmed that the Accused did not inform him that “he never fought with anyone” during the recording of Exhibit P9[^118].

49     PW7 denied the Defence’s suggestion that he had told the Accused that he was not going to record down what the Accused had told him and that the Accused could tell his story to the court[^119]. PW7 also denied the Defence’s suggestion that he had told the Accused that no matter who started the fight, the Accused could just go to court to tell the judge what had happened and if the Accused were to succeed in court, then nothing would happen to him. But if the Accused was unsuccessful, then something would happen to him[^120].

50     PW7 also recorded the Accused’s section 22 CPC statement (Exhibit P10). PW7 had recorded Exhibit P10 from the Accused by himself and there were no other persons present during the recording of the statement[^121]. PW7 had recorded Exhibit P10 from the Accused after he had recorded Exhibit P9[^122].

51     PW7 started recording Exhibit P10 from the Accused at about 6.50 pm on 15 October 2017[^123] and the recording ended at 7.40 pm on the same day[^124]. PW7 clarified that there was a typo in the end time in Exhibit P10 and the end time should read 7.40 pm instead of 7.40 am[^125]. PW7 stated that there was another mistake in the last paragraph on page 3 of Exhibit P10. PW7 said that he had recorded Exhibit P10 using a laptop using a template and he had printed out the recorded statement from the laptop. When PW7 printed out the recorded statement, he forgot to delete the words “I also read my statement and confirmed it to be correct” from the template[^126].

52     PW7 confirmed that there was no threat, inducement or promise made by PW7 to the Accused when he was recording Exhibit P10 from the Accused and that the Accused had given his statement voluntarily[^127]. PW7 also confirmed that the Accused was very cooperative during the recording of his statement[^128].

53     PW7 had interviewed the Accused using Mandarin for Exhibit P10 and he had recorded the same in the English language. PW7 did explain to the Accused that he would converse with the Accused in Mandarin, but he would record the Accused’s statement in English and the Accused did confirm that he was comfortable with the arrangement for his statement to be recorded in English[^129].

54     PW7 testified that in both his interviews with the Accused when he recorded Exhibits P9 and P10, the Accused had only informed him that he was pushed by PW6 and he did not tell PW7 that he was strangled by PW6[^130]. PW7 also said that the Accused did not inform him during the recording of Exhibit P9 that he was beaten up by 4 men after he had pushed away PW6[^131]. PW7 also denied the Defence’s suggestion that the Accused had told him this information and that he had failed to record the same[^132].

55     As for paragraph 3 of Exhibit P10, PW7 also denied the Defence’s suggestion PW7 that the Accused did not use the word “retaliate” in Exhibit P10, but this word was paraphrased and included in Exhibit P10 by PW7[^133].

56     PW7 also said that after he had recorded the Accused’s statements in Exhibit P10, he did read back whatever that he had recorded to the Accused in Mandarin and the Accused did not object to what was recorded and he proceeded to sign the statement willingly[^134]. PW7 also denied the Defence’ suggestion that he did not read and explain the recorded statement and that he had only read part of the recorded statement to the Accused in Mandarin[^135].

57     PW7 also testified that the Accused had never informed him that PW6 had grabbed the Accused’s neck and had pushed him up the wall and had strangled him during the recording of both Exhibits P9 and P10, otherwise PW7 would have recorded the same into both the statements[^136].

58     PW7 also denied the Defence’s suggestion that he had only recorded some of the Accused’s statements and had left out other parts of the Accused’s statement in Exhibit P10. PW7 also confirmed that the Accused did not inform him about PW6 strangling him and another 4 persons beating him up just before the Accused signed Exhibit P10[^137]. PW7 also denied telling the Accused that the law in Singapore was different from the law in China and that in the worst-case scenario, that the Accused would only get “a few months” during the recording of Exhibit P10[^138].

59     PW7 also confirmed that he did read and explain to DW3 his statement in Mandarin before DW3 signed his statement[^139].

#### PW8 – SGT Nimrod Goh Tian Jin

60     PW8 was one of the police officers who had responded to the incident on 14 October 2017. Upon arrival at the scene, PW8 and PW4 spoke to PW1 and PW1 informed them that 2 workers were involved in a scuffle[^140]. PW4 then proceeded to interview PW6 while PW8 interviewed the Accused[^141]. PW8 had assisted PW4 to interview the Accused because PW4 could not speak Mandarin. PW8 also confirmed both he and the Accused could understand each other when they were speaking to each other in Mandarin[^142].

61     PW8 had interviewed the Accused for about 15 to 20 minutes outside the office container area after the incident[^143]. The Accused told PW8 that he had a dispute with PW6 over a broom which had escalated into a scuffle[^144]. The Accused told PW8 that he could not remember the details as things had happened very fast. PW8 did ask the Accused several times if there were weapons used during the scuffle or whether there were exchange of punches and the Accused had told PW8 that he could not remember anything because the incident had happened too fast[^145].

62     When PW8 was interviewing the Accused, he noticed that there were scratch marks on the Accused’s neck. PW8 then activated the paramedic to check on the Accused’s injury[^146]. The paramedic assessed the Accused’s wounds and said that it was just abrasion and the Accused need not be conveyed to the hospital for any treatment[^147]. PW8 also noted that there was no bleeding or blood gushing out from the Accused’s wound[^148].

63     PW8 did ask the Accused about his injury and the Accused told PW8 that he believed he had suffered the injury through the scuffle. When PW8 tried to ask the Accused about the details of the scuffle, the Accused told PW8 that he could not recall how he had suffered the injury or what had happened during the scuffle[^149]. However, the Accused did tell PW8 that he believed that PW6 was responsible for his injury, but he could not remember how the injury was caused[^150].

64     After interviewing the Accused for the first time, PW8 reported his findings to ASP Paulus and PW4. PW4 then reported the matter to PW7[^151]. PW8 recalled telling PW4 about the scratch marks on the Accused’s neck[^152]. PW8 also told PW4 that the Accused had told him that he thought PW6 was the one who had caused his injury[^153]. However, PW8 did not recall telling PW4 that “the Accused had told him he felt a knock on his head area, but he did not see, and he was not sure how he got \[the injury\]”[^154].

65     PW8 testified that after his first interview with the Accused, he went back with ASP Paulus to interview the Accused a second time to try and find out more information from the Accused[^155]. PW8 had decided to speak to the Accused a second time because he wanted to gather more facts from the Accused to see if the Accused could recall anything else[^156].

66     PW8 testified that ASP Paulus also spoke to the Accused during the second interview[^157]. PW8 was present when ASP Paulus spoke to the Accused but PW8 could not recall exactly what ASP Paulus and the Accused had talked about[^158]. However, PW8 could recall that ASP Paulus was trying to confirm from the Accused the facts that PW8 had given him and ASP Paulus was asking the Accused about the details relating to the scuffle[^159]. PW8 recalled the Accused telling ASP Paulus that he could not remember the details of the scuffle[^160].

67     PW8 testified that he spoke to the Accused after the Accused had spoken to ASP Paulus and he had tried to ask the Accused of the details of the scuffle but the Accused told him that he could not remember the details[^161].

68     After the second interview, the Accused was placed under arrest after PW7 gave them the instruction to arrest the Accused[^162]. When PW8 was placing the Accused under arrest, the Accused suddenly complained of chest pain and PW8 arranged for the paramedic to check the Accused a second time[^163]. The paramedic after checking the Accused the second time, recommended that the Accused be conveyed to the hospital for further checks[^164].

69     PW8 had accompanied the Accused to the hospital to be examined. When the Accused was waiting to be examined by the doctor at the A&E observation ward, the Accused asked PW8 as to why he was being arrested while he was at the hospital. PW8 told the Accused even though he was at the hospital, he was still under police custody[^165]. The Accused then asked PW8 as to how long the process would take and when he would be released. PW8 told the Accused that he did not know how long the process would take but the doctor would first need to examine the Accused and thereafter, he would need to go to the police station for further investigation[^166]. The Accused then told PW8 that he no longer had chest pain and he wished to be discharged from the hospital. However, PW8 told the Accused that it would be better for him to be examined by a doctor as he had complained of chest pain and the Accused accepted his explanation[^167].

### Defence’s evidence and exhibits

70     As for the Defence, the Defence had called a total of 5 witnesses in the Accused’s defence:

72     The Defence evidence could be summarised as follows:

#### DW1 – the Accused

73     The Accused testified that he was unable to speak or understand English and that he was only able to understand one or two simple English words[^168].

74     In his Examination-In-Chief (“EIC”), the Accused had testified to the following:

> (a)     The Accused was employed by Tian Di Construction Pte Ltd as a tiling worker[^169]. On 14 October 2017, the Accused was working on the 20th floor of Block 448A and he had started work in unit #XXX. When the Accused was working in unit #XXX, PW6 was also working in the same unit[^170]. The Accused was doing cleaning work in the kitchen and living room area while PW6 was cleaning the external wall at the balcony[^171]. The Accused testified that he required a scraper and a broom for his work[^172]. On the day in question, the Accused did not have a broom of his own and he had used a broom which he had found at unit #XXX[^173]. PW6 saw the Accused using his broom and he wanted back his broom back. When PW6 wanted his broom back, the Accused used his hand to gesture to PW6 that he needed to use the broom for a while longer as he had a small area left to clean up but PW6 refused to let him have the broom and he took the broom away[^174].

> (b)     After the Accused had finished his work at unit #XXX, he went to work at unit #XXX[^175]. The Accused testified that PW6 was not working in unit #XXX when the Accused was cleaning unit #XXX[^176]. PW6 was still in unit #XXX when the Accused went over to unit #XXX[^177].

> (c)     After PW6 took the broom away, the Accused went to look for another broom and he went to the other end of the common corridor and he found another broom which he wanted to use to complete his work[^178]. The Accused was making his way back to unit #XXX with the broom that he had found when he saw PW6 and 3 other workers standing outside unit #XXX. PW6 who was facing the Accused, asked the Accused in Mandarin “What do you want?”[^179].

> (d)     At that time, the Accused was holding a scraper in his right hand and he was holding the broom that he found on his left hand[^180]. PW6 then shouted at the Accused “What are you trying to do”[^181]. After that, PW6 walked towards the Accused very quickly, strangled his neck and pushed the Accused against the wall next to the metal gate of unit #XXX[^182].

> (e)     The Accused said that PW6 had used his right hand to strangle the Accused’s neck[^183]. The Accused had difficulty breathing when PW6 strangled him and he used his right hand to push PW6 away once[^184]. The Accused forgot that he was holding onto the scraper in his right hand at that time. The Accused just wanted to push PW6 away[^185].

> (f)     PW6 then used his left hand to grab the Accused’s right forearm and one of the 3 workers who was with PW6 grabbed the Accused’s left hand which was holding onto the broom[^186]. The same worker then used both his hands to pull the Accused’s left hand causing him to turn around towards his right side and face the other side of the corridor[^187]. The other 2 workers, who were standing behind the Accused started kicking and punching him from behind in his back and lower back[^188].

> (g)     PW6 and the worker who was holding onto the Accused’s left hand then dragged the Accused to the floor. PW6 was holding onto the Accused’s wrist and the other worker was holding to the Accused’s upper arm[^189].

> (h)     The Accused was pushed backwards, and he fell to the ground[^190]. As the Accused was falling to the ground, he was hit in the shoulder[^191]. After that, the Accused was beaten by the 4 men for about 3 to 5 minutes before the other workers came to separate them[^192].

> (i)     When the other workers came to separate them, the other 3 workers moved away to the other side of the lift lobby. However, PW6 continued to hold onto the Accused’s arm and body. PW6 refused to let the Accused get up and the Accused struggled with PW6 on the ground. PW6 had used his body to press onto the Accused’s body when they were on the ground[^193]. PW6 had also used one of his hands to hold onto and restrain the Accused’s right hand and he used his right elbow to press on the Accused’s body[^194].

> (j)     By the time the Accused managed to get up from the ground, all the 4 attackers had left the scene and they had gone down to the canteen area[^195]. After that, DW3 went up to the 20th floor and he asked the Accused to go down to the canteen area with him[^196]. The 2 of them went down to the canteen area and they met up with the project manager from the main contractor[^197]. The project manager asked the Accused why he had gotten into a fight and the Accused told him that the 4 men had attacked him first[^198]. The project manager told the Accused that the broom belonged to the main contractor[^199]. The project manager also told the Accused that even though the 4 men had beaten up the Accused, he had caused serious injury to them and he should pay for their medical fees[^200]. The Accused was angry with the project manager and he refused to answer the project manager[^201].

> (k)     When DW2 arrived at the canteen, he asked the Accused why he had fought and the Accused told him that he had used PW6’s broom but PW6 had strangled him first and the 4 men had beaten him up[^202]. DW2 then suggested to the Accused to pay for half of the medical fees but the Accused did not agree[^203]. The project manager then told the Accused that since he was not going to pay PW6’s medical fees, the project manager would proceed to call the police and the Accused told him to go ahead to call the police[^204]. After that, the project manager asked PW1 to contact the police[^205]. DW2 also noted the Accused’s injury on his neck and he took a photograph of the same[^206].

> (l)     When the police arrived, PW8 spoke to the Accused and he asked the Accused twice as to what he had used to cause such serious injury to PW6[^207]. The Accused said that he did not answer PW8 because he was the one who was beaten up and all PW8 was asking him was what he had used to injure PW6[^208]. The Accused had refused to answer PW8 because he felt that it was unfair and PW8 had also not asked him for his reasons[^209].

> (m)     Other than PW8, ASP Paulus also spoke to the Accused. ASP Paulus had asked the Accused as to why he was involved in a fight and the Accused had informed ASP Paulus that he was attacked by 4 men and he had also described how the attack had taken place to ASP Paulus[^210]. The Accused said that he told ASP Paulus that 2 of the men had grabbed his shoulder and arm and 2 other men had kicked and punched him before he fell to the ground. The Accused said that he told ASP Paulus that the 4 men had beaten him for 3 to 5 minutes and when he fell to the ground, his body had landed first followed by his head[^211]. I noted ASP Paulus’s conditioned statement that he was unable to recall the details of what had happened on 14 October 2017[^212]. I also noted that the practice of the responding officers then was to leave briefing notes to the investigation officer on duty[^213].

> (n)     The Accused testified that he had informed the paramedic that he was attacked on his back, strangled, and he felt pain in several places[^214]. The Accused also said that he had informed the paramedic of the location of his pain and that he had felt pain in some areas on his back[^215]. The Accused also said that he did not tell the paramedic that he was attacked by 4 men and he told the paramedic that a few persons had attacked him[^216]. I noted the paramedic’s conditioned statement that he could not recall what had happened on that day[^217].

> (o)     The Accused also testified that when he was being arrested and handcuffed, he did tell the arresting officer that he needed to see a doctor and he was taken to the hospital by way of ambulance. The Accused said that he had informed the officer who had handcuffed him that he was beaten. The Accused could not remember who was the officer he had informed as there were 2 officers who had arrested him[^218]. I noted that according to the arrest report (Exhibit P7), 2 police officers had assisted in the arrest of the Accused and the 2 officers were SSGT Ridhwan and PW8[^219].

> (p)     At Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, the Accused told DW5, who had attended to him, that he was beaten on his back and there were areas where he felt pain. As for his neck injury, the Accused testified that the bleeding had stopped by the time he had reached the hospital. The Accused also told DW5 that he was strangled[^220].

> (q)     The Accused also confirmed that PW7 had recorded his cautioned statement (Exhibit P9). During EIC, the Accused had testified that in the course of the recording of Exhibit P9, he did tell PW7 that he had never come across a situation like the present case and he did not know how to write down what happened and he requested PW7 to help him to pen down everything[^221]. The Accused also said that he did not tell PW7 that he was strangled by PW6 because PW7 did not ask him any such question[^222].

75     However, during cross-examination, the Accused had testified to the following in relation to Exhibit P9:

> (a)     The Accused said that PW7 did not explain the charge and he also did not administer the Notice of Warning to the Accused before he proceeded to record the Accused’s statement in Exhibit P9[^223]. The Accused said that PW7 merely asked him “Do you wish to say anything to the judge? I will help you put it down in writing”[^224].

> (b)     The Accused also said that he proceeded to sign Exhibit P9 even though the charge and Notice of Warning was not administered and explained to him because PW7 had asked him to sign the document and he just complied with PW7’s instruction[^225].

> (c)     The Accused also said that when he was asked by PW7 to sign Exhibit P9, he did inform PW7 that PW6 was the one who had hit him first and that 4 men had beaten him up[^226]. However, PW7 did not record all these in Exhibit P9[^227]. PW7 had just asked the Accused if his injury was less serious than PW6’s injury and whether the Accused was holding any tool in his hand[^228]. PW7 also told the Accused that no matter who started the fight, he should go and tell the judge. If the Accused succeeded before the judge, nothing would happen to the Accused. However, if he was not successful before the judge, then something would happen to him[^229]. The Accused also said that he did inform PW7 that he did not hit PW6 intentionally but PW7 told him if he had anything to say in his defence, that he should just go to court and inform the judge[^230].

> (d)     The Accused testified that after Exhibit P9 was recorded, PW7 did not read the statement back to the Accused in Mandarin and he also did not interpret everything in Exhibit P9 to him[^231]. PW7 also did not invite the Accused to make any addition, correction or deletion to Exhibit P9[^232].

76     The Accused confirmed that he had given a long statement to PW7 (Exhibit P10)[^233]. The Accused had testified to the following things about Exhibit P10 in his EIC:

> (a)     As regards to paragraph 1 of Exhibit P10, the Accused testified that he did not tell PW7 that “he was comfortable for his statement to be recorded in English”[^234];

> (b)     As for paragraph 3 of Exhibit P10, the Accused testified that he had informed PW7 that “he was strangled by the dark complexion man and the dark complexion man had laid hand on him first. The Accused then used his hand to push the dark complexion man away. After the Accused had pushed him away, 4 men had beaten up the Accused”[^235]. However, PW7 had failed to record all these information in Exhibit P10;

> (c)     The Accused also testified that he had informed PW7 that he merely wanted to push the dark complexion man away and he forgot that he was holding onto the scraper and that he did not have the intention to cause hurt to the dark complexion man[^236]. PW7 had also failed to record all these information in Exhibit P10;

> (d)     The Accused also said that he did not use the word “retaliate” in paragraph 3 of Exhibit P10;

> (e)     The Accused also disputed the accuracy of the following information which were recorded in Exhibit P10:

>> (i)       Regarding paragraph 4 of Exhibit P10, the Accused disputed the accuracy of the information which was recorded. The Accused said that he was arrested at the worksite and not at hospital as stated in paragraph 4[^237];

>> (ii)       As for Question A6 in Exhibit P10, the Accused said that he did not tell PW7 that he merely wanted to throw a punch towards the dark complexion man. The Accused said that he told PW7 that he had pushed PW6 once and it was not intentional[^238]; and

> (f)     PW7 had failed to read and explain Exhibit P10 to the Accused in Mandarin after he had recorded the same from the Accused[^239].

77     During cross-examination, the Accused had testified to the following about Exhibit P10:

> (a)     At the time of the signing of Exhibit P10, the Accused told PW7 that it was PW6 who had attacked him first but PW7 just told him to tell that to the court[^240]. The Accused also told PW7 that 4 persons had attacked him but PW7 just replied to him that PW6 had suffered more serious injury. PW7 then proceeded to ask the Accused if he was holding a tool in his hand and he had caused hurt to PW6 and the Accused answered him “Yes”. PW7 then pointed to the Accused where to sign in Exhibit P10 and ask the Accused to sign at the relevant part;

> (b)     As regards to Question Q5 on page 2 of Exhibit P10, the Accused said that PW7 did not ask him the question which was recorded in Question Q5. PW7 had merely asked the Accused “where is the scraper”[^241];

> (c)     The Accused said that during the recording of Exhibit P10, PW7 had asked him if he knew who the owner of the broom was and where he had obtained the broom from. The Accused had told PW7 that he had obtained the broom from another location but PW7 did not record all this information in Exhibit P10[^242];

> (d)     It was recorded in paragraph 3 of Exhibit P10 that the Accused and the dark complexion man had tugged over the broom. The Accused said that there was no tugging over the broom on the day of the incident[^243];

> (e)     The Accused said that he had informed PW7 that PW6 had strangled and pushed him backwards. However, PW7 had only recorded that PW6 had pushed the Accused in Exhibit P10[^244];

> (f)     The Accused said that he had told PW7 that he had stretched out his hand to push PW6 away but PW7 had recorded that he retaliated and had swung his hand towards PW6. The Accused also said that at that time, he had forgotten that he was holding onto a tool and he had accidentally hurt PW6[^245];

> (g)     The Accused said that what he had told PW7 was that PW6 had wanted to take the broom away and he did not want to give the broom to PW6. PW6 then strangled him. They did not tug over the broom. This incident was their second encounter on that day. With regard to the 1st incident, PW6 had stretched out his hand and had wanted to take away the broom. The Accused then proceeded to give him the broom[^246]. During the 1st encounter, there was a tussle over the broom which took place in unit #XXX[^247]. During the 2nd encounter, when parties were outside the unit, there was no tugging over the broom[^248]. However, I noted that the Accused changed his evidence in the course of cross-examination to say that there was no tussle with PW6 on both the occasions. The Accused went on to say that during the 1st encounter, PW6 wanted the broom and the Accused proceeded to let him have the broom. During the 2nd encounter, PW6 had tried to pull the broom away and when the Accused pulled his arm backwards, PW6 strangled the Accused. The Accused said he merely gave PW6 a push[^249]. The Accused also said that PW6 did not take the broom from the Accused during the 2nd encounter[^250];

> (h)     The Accused acknowledged that Exhibit P11 was the Case for the Defence filed by the Defence[^251]. The Accused said that he disagreed with the contents of Exhibit P11 and that he did not know that he was holding onto a scraper when he had his encounter with PW6. The Accused said that when PW6 tried to strangle him, his natural response was to push PW6 away and it was when he noticed that PW6 was hurt that he realised that he was holding onto a tool[^252];

> (i)     Exhibit P11 did not state that the Accused was attacked by 4 men. The Accused also said that he did inform his counsel of the same but his counsel did not include that fact in Exhibit P11. Instead his counsel had told him that he could explain the same clearly when he goes to court[^253];

> (j)     The Accused also said that he did not fight with PW6, He had merely given PW6 a push[^254];

> (k)     When the Accused was sent to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, he was attended to and examined by DW5[^255]. The Accused had testified that he told DW5 that PW6 had strangled his neck and pushed him against the wall. 4 persons, including PW6, then pinned him down. DW5 had asked the Accused if he had landed on his head or buttocks and the Accused told him that he had landed on his buttocks[^256]. However, later during cross-examination, the Accused changed his evidence and said that he had told DW5 that he had landed on his lower back and buttock and not the head[^257]. The Accused also said that his head was not hurt, and he did not suffer any head injury. The Accused felt pain in his neck and lower back. The Accused also confirmed that he did not hit his head against the ground[^258]. Subsequently during cross-examination, the Accused again changed his evidence to say that he did tell DW5 that he had hit his head, his head landed on the ground but there was no head injury[^259];

> (l)     DW5 had recorded in Exhibit P10 that the Accused had told him that “3 other colleagues had turned him over and kicked his back”[^260]. The Accused clarified that what he meant was 3 other persons together with PW6 had beaten him up[^261].

78     The Accused had also testified to the following during re-examination:

> (a)     During re-examination, Defence Counsel asked the Accused as to when he had informed PW7 that PW6 had grabbed him and had pushed him up the wall. The Accused he could not remember whether it was during the recording of Exhibit P9 or P10[^262]. The Accused also said that he could not remember whether he had informed PW7 about the strangling during the recording of Exhibit P9 or P10[^263]. The Accused also said that he had informed PW7 that he had gone to the hospital to consult a doctor because he was beaten up by 4 men[^264]. PW7 had asked him the reason for the assault and the Accused told him it was because of the broom[^265].

> (b)     When the Accused was signing Exhibit P10, he said that he did inform PW7 that PW6 had struggled with him and 4 of them had assaulted him[^266]. PW7 then told him not to be afraid and that the matter was not a serious matter. PW7 also informed the Accused that based on his experience, the Accused should go to court to tell the court what had happened. If everything went on smoothly, nothing would happen to the Accused. Otherwise, the Accused would expect to get a few months jail[^267].

> (c)     The Accused also testified that when he was working in unit #XXX with PW6, the broom was placed at the doorway of unit #XXX[^268]. The Accused had taken PW6’s broom from the doorway in front of PW6 and told him he needed to use the mop[^269]. PW6 allowed him to use the broom[^270]. After the Accused finished unit #XXX, he went over to unit #XXX[^271] and he had almost finished cleaning unit #XXX when PW6 wanted his broom back. The Accused tried to tell PW6 that he had a small area left to clean but PW6 stretched out his hand and took the broom away from the Accused[^272]. The Accused said that he was not angry with PW6 when he took the broom away because the broom belonged to PW6[^273].

> (d)     When the Accused was being examined by DW5, DW5 did ask him if he had any head injury and whether he had landed on his head or buttocks. DW5 also asked the Accused about his head, lower back and buttock. The Accused told DW5 that his head was not injured but his lower back was kicked and punched by the assailants. When DW5 asked the Accused whether he had landed on his head or buttock first, the Accused told DW5 that his buttock and lower back had landed on the ground first[^274].

79     When I tried to clarify with the Accused as to exactly how he was attacked by the 4 men, the Accused told me that PW6 had strangled him and held onto his right hand. One other person had held onto his left hand. The other 2 persons then kicked and punched him from the back. The person who was holding onto his left hand, then turned him from his right side with force. As the Accused was falling to the ground, the 2 men from behind kept kicking and punching him as he was falling. When the Accused fell to the ground, PW6 and the other man who was holding onto the Accused’s left arm started kicking him on his side. The man who was holding onto the Accused’s left arm kicked the Accused twice on the left side of his body after he had fallen. The Accused also said that he had told the police that after the few of them had assaulted him, PW6 did not assault the Accused any more[^275].

#### DW2 – Sun Zhi Dong

80     DW2 was the director of Tian Di Construction Pte Ltd and the Accused was one of his workers. DW2 testified that on the day of the incident, the Accused was responsible for tiling works and he required a scraper to do his work[^276]. DW2 had seen the Accused at level 20 at about 8 plus in the morning of 14 October 2017. The next time DW2 saw the Accused was at the canteen at about 10 plus in the morning[^277]. The main contractor had informed DW2 that the Accused was involved in a dispute with one of his workers[^278].

81     DW2 testified that he spoke to the Accused and the Accused told him that he was holding onto a broom and PW6 wanted to snatch away his broom. The Accused refused to let PW6 have the broom and PW6 strangled the Accused’s neck[^279]. After that 3 other men came over and pinned the Accused down to the ground[^280]. The Accused did not tell DW2 what the 3 men had done to him when they pinned him to the ground[^281]. I also noted that the Accused also did not tell DW2 that he was attacked by the 3 men. DW2 asked the Accused if he was injured and the Accused told him that his neck was injured. DW2 then went on to take photographs of the Accused’s injury[^282]. After that, DW2 told DW3 to take more photographs of the Accused’s head and neck area[^283].

82     DW2 also testified that he did not tell the Accused that he should compensate PW6. He merely asked the Accused how the matter could be resolved[^284].

#### DW3 – Wang De Zhou

83     DW3 was working in Tian Di Construction Pte Ltd as a supervisor in October 2017 and the Accused was one of the employees who were working for the company[^285]. DW3 had known the Accused for about 1 year at the time of the incident[^286]. DW3 testified that the Accused was in charge of ceramic tiles and gaps between the tiles[^287]. On the day of the incident, DW3 had arranged for the Accused to fill up the gaps in the floor tiles in the units.

84     DW3 testified that on 14 October 2017, he was in another block of flats when he learnt of the incident at about 9 am in the morning. DW3 was informed by a lift operator that there were people fighting at the worksite[^288]. When DW3 arrived at the scene of the incident, the fight was over, and he saw the Accused at the scene but PW6 was not there[^289]. DW3 then received a telephone call from someone from the safety department of the main contractor asking him to bring the Accused to the office which was located next to the canteen[^290].

85     After the Accused had gone down to the office with the Accused, the Accused told DW3 that he had been in a fight with PW6, who was an employee of the main contractor over a broom[^291]. The Accused told DW3 that 3 to 4 workers from the main contractor had attacked him[^292]. DW3 said that the Accused told him that initially he was fighting with one worker initially. After that, 3 to 4 other workers appeared[^293] and they also fought with him[^294]. The Accused had suffered injury to his neck, and he was bleeding from the neck. DW3 only saw the injury to the Accused’s neck and he was not sure if the Accused had suffered any other injuries[^295]. DW3 then proceeded to take a photograph of the Accused’s injury[^296]. DW3 testified that he saw abrasions on the Accused’s neck[^297].

86     DW3 also testified that the Accused did not tell him that he had hit PW6 in the mouth with a cement scraper[^298]. DW3 confirmed that he was present when DW2 spoke to the Accused at the canteen, but he did not hear what they were talking about as they were standing some distance away from him[^299].

87     I also noted that after DW3 had given his evidence in court, the Prosecution had applied to impeach DW3’s testimony in court with his statement given to the police[^300]. In Exhibit P12, DW3 had told PW7 who had recorded his statement that the Accused had informed him that he had a scuffle with a dark complexion worker over a broom and his neck injury was caused by the scuffle between the Accused and the dark complexion worker[^301]. It was not recorded in Exhibit P12 that the Accused had informed DW3 that he was attacked by 3 to 4 workers[^302]. In reply, DW3 said that he did not mention this in Exhibit P12 because he was not asked of the same by PW7[^303].

#### DW4 – Dr Tien De Yang Justin

88     DW4 was a locum doctor working at the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and he was the doctor who had prepared the Accused's medical report (Exhibit D3)[^304]. DW4 was not the doctor who had attended to the Accused and he had prepared Exhibit D3 based on the Accused’s patient documentation record at the Emergency Department of the hospital (Exhibit D4)[^305]. The doctor who had attended to the Accused was DW5[^306].

89     DW4 testified that DW5 had recorded in Exhibit D4 that the Accused had alleged that he was assaulted by one colleague and three other colleagues had turned him over and had kicked his back[^307].

90     DW4 had stated in Exhibit D3 that the Accused “was seen … for an alleged assault by his colleagues. He had complained of neck and back pain as a result. Clinical examination revealed mild tenderness over cervical and upper thoracic spine. There was mild pain with neck movement to the left. There were mild excoriations seen in the anterior neck. There were no neurological deficits. X-ray investigations of the chest and cervical spine revealed no fractures. The patient was treated conservatively with analgesia and medical leave. He was discharge on the same day. Diagnosis: Neck and back contusions secondary to assault”[^308]. DW3 clarified that there was a typographical error in his diagnosis in Exhibit D3 and that the injuries should be due to an “alleged assault” rather than “an actual assault”[^309].

91     DW4 also noted and explained the following in Exhibit D3:

> (a)     “Tenderness” referred to pain when pressing the spine of the backbone[^310];

> (b)     “Cervical spine” referred to the neck region and the “thoracic spine” referred to the middle back region[^311];

> (c)     For “mild pain with neck movement to the left”, injuries of such mature could be caused by direct or indirect trauma. It could have been caused by a direct blow to the cervical or thoracic spine or an indirect blow like someone being pushed or falling towards a wall[^312];

> (d)     “Anterior excoriation in anterior neck” referred to superficial abraded skin usually caused by scratching motion on fingers. It could also be caused by tolls or objects. Anterior referred to the front of the neck. DW4 also explained that excoriations were considered mild as compared to lacerations[^313];

> (e)     “No neurological deficits” meant no damage to the brain or spinal cord[^314]; and

> (f)     As for X-rays, X-rays were routinely ordered for trauma and assault cases to determine abnormality of vital organs such as the heart and lungs. In the present case, DW5 had ordered a front and side view X-ray of the cervical spine to rule out any fracture or other abnormalities of the spine. No fracture of the spine was detected in the present case. DW4 noted that other than mild pain of the cervical spine, the Accused had also complained of pain in the upper thoracic spine[^315];

92     When asked to comment on Exhibits D1 and D2 by the Defence, DW4 was of the view that based on the limited views, the injuries shown in Exhibits D1 and D2 could be classified as mild to moderate excoriations[^316]. DW4 was of the view that there were limitations to 2 dimensional photographs as they could be angled to make an injury look more serious and DW4 could not comment any further because he did not examine the Accused himself[^317].

93     During cross-examination by the Prosecution, DW4 also clarified the following:

> (a)     The X-ray reports were prepared by one Dr Thuluwage[^318];

> (b)     The triage nurse had noticed that there was redness over the Accused’s neck and she had recorded the same in Exhibit D4[^319];

> (c)     Based on Exhibit D4, there were no other visible injuries found on the Accused other than the mild excoriation on his neck[^320]. However, DW4 did clarify that it was possible that there could be other injuries even though they were not visible[^321];

> (d)     The neck and back contusions were recorded because the Accused had reported the same. However, these injuries were not supported by any visible symptoms[^322];

> (e)     There were no chest pains recorded in both Exhibits D3 and D4[^323];

> (f)     In Exhibit D4, DW5 had documented that the Accused was grabbed by the neck. It was not recorded in Exhibit D4 that the Accused was strangled[^324];

> (g)     It was recorded in Exhibit D4 that the Accused had complained of “mild non vertiginous giddiness and subsequently able to ambulate”. DW4 was unable to ascertain if this was caused by the Accused being grabbed in the neck or due to multiple blows[^325]. However, DW4 confirmed that it was recorded in Exhibit D4 that the Accused had complained of giddiness and this could have impaired his orientation, but it was a transient thing. DW4 also noted that it was recorded in Exhibit D4 that the Accused had complained of “pain over C7 spine, thoracic spine, non-vertiginous giddiness improving”. So, it was clear that he was having some giddiness when he was talking to DW5[^326]. DW4 also clarified that giddiness could also be caused by mental shock or trauma from the alleged assault[^327];

> (h)     The Accused did not complain to DW5 that he was unable to see. Otherwise, it would have been documented in Exhibit D4 as blurring of vision. In the present case, that was not documented in Exhibit D4[^328]; and

> (i)     It was recorded in Exhibit D4 that DW5 had ordered X-rays of the cervical regions (front and side view). DW5 had also recorded in Exhibit D4 that the Accused had complained of mild pain over C7 spine and thoracic spine. However, DW5 did not specify in Exhibit D4 which part of the thoracic spine that the Accused was experiencing pain[^329].

94     DW4 also noted that the triage nurse had used the word “strangled” in Exhibit D4 when she examined him on 14 October 2017. DW4 clarified that for triage nurses, they were supposed to note down what the patients say and there was no interpretation on the part of the triage nurse[^330]. Whereas for doctors, it was important to distinguish between the words “grab” and “strangle” because they had different meanings in terms of intention. DW4 explained that the word “strangle” usually involved a manoeuvre to actually cause asphyxiation[^331].

95     DW4 also confirmed that there was no mention in Exhibit D4 that the Accused had told DW5 that he was grabbed in the neck, pushed down and 3 colleagues had turned him over and kicked his back[^332]. According to Exhibit D4, the Accused had claimed that he was grabbed in the neck and he was pushed down and he landed on his buttocks. DW4 also testified that it was possible that the landing on the buttock could have caused the pain to the Accused’s thoracic spine[^333].

#### DW5 – Dr Bey Shimin

96     DW5 was working as a medical officer in the Emergency Department of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on 14 October 2017 and he was the doctor who had attended to and examined the Accused[^334]. At that point of time, DW5 had been working at the Emergency Department for about 2 months. DW5 was also fluent in both the English and Mandarin language[^335].

97     DW5 had testified as to the following:

> (a)     At the triage stage before the Accused was examined by DW5, the Accused’s chief complaint to the triage nurse was backache (i.e. pain in the lower back), being strangled by a colleague in the neck region, redness over the neck area, and giddiness of a non-vertigo nature[^336].

> (b)     When DW5 examined the Accused, the Accused had told DW5 that he was working as a cleaner and he had a fight with a colleague over the broom, The colleague had grabbed the Accused by the neck, pushed him down and had caused him to land on his buttocks. The Accused also told DW5 that he did not suffer any neck or head injury when he landed on his buttocks. DW5 also testified that the Accused did not inform him that his head had landed on the ground and that he had landed on his lower back. The Accused had told DW5 that he had landed on his buttocks and he denied any head injury[^337]. After that, 3 other colleagues had turned the Accused over, and someone had kicked his back[^338]. The Accused also did not give DW5 a clear account of who had kicked his back. He just told DW5 that he felt someone kick his back[^339]. Subsequently, the Accused was able to ambulate, and he suffered mild non vertiginous giddiness[^340]. DW5 also clarified that he had recorded the Accused’s history as told by the Accused to him in Exhibit D4 in sequential order[^341].

> (c)     The Accused had also complained to DW5 that he was having mild pain over the C7 spine and thoracic spine which referred to the lower part of the neck as well as the middle-upper part of the middle back[^342]. DW5 had also documented “non vertiginous giddiness” which was giddiness which did not present as a sensation of room spinning around and “no other neurological deficit” which meant that there was no other symptoms which was suggestive of nerve injury such as vocal weakness, numbness, blurring of vision and slurring of speech[^343].

> (d)     DW5 also noted that there were “no neck swelling, no difficulty swallowing, no neck pain” which meant that DW5 did not observe any visible or palpable swelling in the Accused’s neck and the Accused did not complain of any difficulty when swallowing his saliva or water[^344]. DW5 also documented no neck pain because if there was worsening neck pain, DW5 would need to order further X-rays, CT scans or tomography to check if there was nerve injury involving the spinal cord[^345].

> (e)     DW5 had also examined the Accused’s head and found no obvious visible injuries such as lacerations, haematomas or bruising[^346].

> (f)     DW5 also examined the Accused’s neck and he found that the Accused did not have any severe pain over his C7 spine as well as his middle back. DW5 also did not observe any obvious deformity on the Accused’s back[^347]. However, DW5 did note that the Accused did have a bit of pain in his lower neck when he tried to turn the Accused’s neck to the left[^348].

> (g)     DW5 testified that he was examining the Accused’s spine, he would palpitate or feel along the spine and ask the Accused where he felt any pain. The Accused did inform DW5 that he felt pain when DW5 touched his C7 spine. The Accused also told DW5 that he felt some pain on the upper part of the thoracic spine which was about 1 to 3 cm below the C7 spine when DW5 palpitated against it[^349]. DW5 explained that this was around the shoulder blade area[^350].

> (h)     DW5 also saw some skin abrasion on the front of the Accused’s neck and he described the injury as non-severe or mild[^351]. DW5 was of the view that the neck excoriations were consistent with being grabbed by someone on the neck[^352]. Other than the mild excoriations on the Accused’s neck, DW5 did not find any other visible injuries on the Accused[^353].

> (i)     After DW5 had examined the Accused, his initial diagnosis/impression was an alleged assault with neck and possible neck/back injury[^354]. DW5 testified that he had come to this conclusion because of what the Accused had informed him and from his examination of the Accused[^355].

> (j)     DW5 had also ordered a chest and a cervical X-ray on the Accused. DW5 had done that because the Accused was grabbed by the neck and there was some tenderness documented over the lower part of the neck. DW5 had wanted to discount any fracture or dislocation over the neck[^356].

> (k)     DW5 also did not observe any physical injuries on the posterior part of the Accused’s neck and back. He also did not observe any chest pain on the Accused[^357].

> (l)     DW5 clarified that the Accused did not inform him that he was hit on the shoulder and strangled. The Accused also did not inform DW5 that he was beaten on his back. The Accused had informed DW5 that he was kicked. DW5 also testified that the Accused did not inform him that he could not see properly[^358]

> (m)     DW5 also said that the Accused did not tell him that he was pushed against a wall or that he was kicked and punched before he fell to the ground and that 4 persons had pinned him down[^359].

## Prosecution’s Case[^360]

### Introduction

98     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused was a tiling worker, and he had used a cement scraper in the course of his work[^361]. On the morning of 14 October 2017, at about 10.30 a.m., while the Accused and the victim, PW6, were working on the 20th floor of Block 448A Bukit Batok West Avenue 9 (then under construction), they got into an argument over a broom and tussled over it at the common corridor, during which the Accused hit PW6 once on the mouth with a cement scraper, causing a deep laceration on PW6’s right upper lip. The Accused was subsequently charged for the present offence under section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), for voluntarily causing hurt to PW6 with the cement scraper which, when used as a weapon of offence, was likely to cause death.

99     During the recording of the Accused’s cautioned statement (Exhibit P9) on the morning of 15 October 2017, the Accused did not deny the charge or mention anything in his defence. Subsequently, in his long statement (Exhibit P10), which was recorded later that same day, the Accused admitted to swinging a scraper at PW6 and/or that he wanted to throw a punch at PW6 in retaliation for PW6 pushing him, but he supposedly forgot that he was holding a scraper.

100    At trial, the Accused had claimed that he did not deliberately hit PW6 with a scraper and/or that he was trying to push PW6 because the victim was grabbing his neck, and that he was acting in self-defence.

### Elements of the charge

101    The Prosecution submitted that in order to establish the charge under section 324 of the Penal Code, the Prosecution had to prove the following:

> (a)     The Accused had hit PW6 once on the mouth with a cement scraper;

> (b)     The Accused had intended hurt to result from his action or knew that it was likely that he would cause hurt to PW6, which could be inferred from his objective conduct and the surrounding circumstances – see, _Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 449</span> (“**_Muhammad Khalis_**”) at \[42\];

> (c)     The cement scraper when used as a weapon of offence was likely to cause death; and

> (d)     Hurt was thereby caused to PW6, ie a deep laceration on the right upper lip.

102    The Prosecution submitted that on the evidence adduced, the charge against the Accused had been made out beyond a reasonable doubt and the Prosecution urged me to convict the Accused accordingly.

### Accused had hit PW6 once on the mouth with a cement scraper

103    The Prosecution was of the view that it was undisputed that the Accused had hit PW6 once on the mouth with a cement scraper. A close-up photograph of an identical scraper, Exhibit P5(g), was adduced in evidence[^362]. PW6 was also issued with a medical certificate as a result of his injury[^363].

### Hurt was caused to PW6

104    The Prosecution had pointed out that it was not disputed by the Defence that PW6 had suffered hurt i.e., a deep laceration on the right upper lip involving the vermillion border, as stated in the medical report from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital dated 27 November 2017 (Exhibit P2), prepared by PW2.

105    According to Exhibit P2, PW6 was seen at the Emergency Medicine Department of the Hospital, where he complained of upper lip pain and right supraorbital tenderness. His upper lip laceration was sutured, and he was given two days’ medical leave3 and analgesia. While Exhibit P2 stated that the assailant had “used a cement scraper as a weapon, and _inadvertently_ sliced patient’s upper lip”, PW2 (who did not examine the victim) had clarified that the word “inadvertently” was mistakenly written into Exhibit P2, and that no such word was found in the clinical notes, which he had relied on to prepare Exhibit P2[^364]. PW3, who had attended to PW6 at the hospital, also confirmed that PW6 did not say that his injury was caused inadvertently or accidentally[^365].

### The cement scraper was likely to cause death when used as a weapon of offence

106    The Prosecution submitted that whether an instrument when used as a weapon of offence was likely to cause death was a question of fact and degree for the court to decide – see, _Ng Hoe Leong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 337</span> at \[26\].

107    In this case, PW6 was hit on the mouth with the sharp end of the cement scraper, and its sharpness was evident from the deep laceration that was caused to his right upper lip involving the vermillion border. While the scraper used by the Accused could not be found, the first responding police officer PW4 had photographed a similar looking scraper, as shown in exhibits P5(f) and P5(g), which he described as having sharp edges[^366]. The Accused also confirmed that he used a similar scraper with a different handle that day[^367].

108    The Prosecution noted that Defence also appreciated the inherent danger of the cement scraper when used as a weapon, which explained why when PW6 was asked during cross-examination, whether he agreed that the scraper was a dangerous weapon, and that it could cause serious injuries, PW6 had testified that the scraper was a working tool that could cause serious injuries[^368]. The Prosecution also noted that the Defence did not challenge PW6’s evidence in this regard.

109    The Prosecution had submitted that since the cement scraper was a sharp instrument capable of causing serious injuries, it was likely to cause death when used as a weapon of offence.

### The Accused had intended hurt to result from his action

110    The Prosecution submitted that the mental element required for the offence was that the Accused had intended hurt to result from his action or knew that it was likely that hurt would so result. Intention and knowledge could be inferred from the Accused’s objective conduct and all the surrounding circumstances (_Muhammad Khalis_ at \[42\]).

111    The Prosecution submitted that in the present case, the surrounding evidence gave rise to the irresistible inference that the Accused had intended to cause or knew that his action was likely to cause hurt to PW6.

#### The Accused knew that his right hand was holding a scraper.

112    At the time of the incident, the Accused clearly knew that he was holding a cement scraper in his right hand. This was evident from his Case for the Defence (Exhibit P11) at \[4\], which stated that he was holding the scraper in his right hand after he found the disputed broom[^369]. During the trial, the Accused could also recall that he was holding the scraper in his right hand immediately before the acts of violence[^370]. Further, Exhibit P11 did not state that he had forgotten or did not know that he was holding a scraper in his right hand. When cross-examined on Exhibit P11, the Accused had no explanation for the omission of what is supposedly very important to his defence and could only say that forgetting that the scraper was in his right hand was _not important_ to his defence[^371].

113    The Prosecution was of the view that logically speaking, it was incredible that the Accused could _momentarily_ forget that he was holding the scraper, which was not a small object. This was evident from the photographs of a similar scraper in Exhibits P5(f) and P5(g), which suggested that the scraper was of a significant length, with a solid metal blade that was capable of scraping floor tiles[^372]. Therefore, the scraper could not have been of insignificant weight, and the Accused must have felt its weight when he was holding it in his right hand.

114    Significantly, after the incident, when interviewed by the police officers at the scene, the Accused claimed that he could not recall the details of his scuffle with PW6[^373],13 and had refused to answer the police officers when asked if any weapon was used during the scuffle[^374]. In this regard, the Accused acknowledged that if he had admitted to hitting someone with a scraper, it would lead to serious consequences for him[^375].

115    When asked by the Court to explain why he did not tell the police the truth, the Accused could not provide a logical explanation. He initially claimed that the police officer did not ask him how the incident took place[^376], before alleging that he was asked the questions in a “very fast manner”[^377]. This was incredible given his own testimony that the police officer had questioned him at least twice[^378].The responding police officer, PW8, also testified that he had asked the Accused several times about the details of the scuffle, but the Accused had claimed that he could not recall what had happened[^379].

116    Considering the aforesaid, the Prosecution submitted that the irresistible inference was that at all material times, the Accused knew he was holding a scraper in his right hand, and was trying to hide the truth that he had hit PW6 on the mouth with the scraper.

#### The Accused deliberately thrust the scraper towards PW6’s mouth

117    The Prosecution submitted that the manner which the scraper was thrust towards PW6’s mouth suggested that it was a deliberate act of aggression, rather than accidental or defensive in nature. PW6 had testified that while they were tugging back and forth on the broom, the Accused’s right hand, which was holding a scraper, suddenly pushed upwards towards his lips[^380]. The Prosecution also pointed out that the Defence did not dispute the manner the scraper was thrusted towards PW6’s mouth, in a **fast**_[^381]_ upward motion, as described by PW6.

118    The Accused also gave a similar description of what happened in his long statement (Exhibit P10) at \[3\], where he said that they were both tugging at the broom, during which PW6 pushed him, and he retaliated by swinging his right hand, which was holding a scraper, towards PW6.

119    The Prosecution submitted that from the manner and target area of the attack (i.e. the face) which was a vulnerable part of the body, the only inference to be drawn was that the Accused had intended to cause hurt to PW6.

### The Accused’s defence was unbelievable

120    The Prosecution noted that the crux of the Defence’s case was that the Accused was acting in self-defence. In particular, the Accused had alleged that PW6 had strangled him first and he tried to push PW6 away with his right hand, without realising that he was holding a scraper, causing the scraper to hit PW6’s face, and he was subsequently beaten up by four men (including PW6).

#### The Accused’s testimony was inconsistent with his long statement

121    Despite conceding that the investigation officer, PW7, had recorded in the long statement (Exhibit P10) whatever he had told him[^382], the Accused disputed the accuracy of the long statement, where he gave a different account about what had happened, as set out in the table below. The Prosecution was of the view that this was clearly an afterthought by the Accused to account for the material discrepancies between what he had testified to and what he had stated in his long statement.

#### The Accused’s statements were accurately recorded

122    The Prosecution submitted that there was no basis for this Honourable Court to accept that the Accused’s statements were inaccurately recorded. At the outset, the Accused had confirmed that his cautioned statement (Exhibit P9) was accurately recorded[^396]. He understood the nature of the charge after it was explained to him and knew that whatever he needed to inform the Court about the charge was recorded at page 3 of Exhibit P9[^397].

123    In the cautioned statement, the Accused had admitted that he was “_foolish to fight over one simple broom_” and pleaded for a second chance. The clear inference is that the Accused knew what he did was wrong and that he had committed an offence, after the charge was read and explained to him.

124    The allegations of inaccurate recording of his long statement (Exhibit P10), were directed at the paragraphs (\[3\], \[A6\] and \[A8\]) where the Accused said he intended to swing his right hand (which was holding a scraper) and/or throw a punch at PW6, and that he scuffled with PW6 before other people from the worksite pulled them apart[^398]. This smacked of selective objection to the contents of the long statement, brought about by the incriminating nature of the said paragraphs, and the need to explain the inconsistencies between his long statement and his defence at trial.

125    The Prosecution submitted that the evidence before this Court showed that PW7 had recorded the long statement faithfully and accurately, and it was interpreted to the Accused in a language that he understood before he signed it:

> (a)     The Accused did not dispute the voluntariness of the long statement, and there was no question of PW7 having had any motive to mis-record or misrepresent the Accused’s account.

> (b)     PW7 testified that he was proficient in Mandarin, which was the language that the Accused chose to speak in for the recording of the long statement, and they understood each other during the process. PW7 had interpreted the long statement to the Accused in Mandarin, and the Accused agreed that it was his statement before he signed it[^399].

> (c)     Exhibit P10 contained many personal details, such as how many children the Accused had, where his family was staying, and his highest educational qualification. The Accused also alleged that PW6 had pushed him while they were tugging at the broom, which PW7 would not have known unless the Accused had told him[^400].

> (d)     Exhibit P10 also contained the Accused’s exculpatory accounts i.e., that he did not intentionally cause hurt to the victim, and that he had forgotten that he was holding a scraper in his right hand, which were repeated by the Accused in court.

> (e)     PW7 gave the Accused a chance at the end of the statement recording to make corrections[^401]. He also read and explained the statement to the Accused in Mandarin, and the Accused understood the statement before signing it[^402].

126    In any event, the Prosecution noted that the Accused had conceded during cross-examination that PW7 recorded (in English) whatever that the Accused had told him[^403]. It was noteworthy that the Accused clearly understood more English than he would have liked the Court to believe. During the trial, there were several times when he answered the Court’s questions before they were translated to him[^404]. He was also observed to be reading the long statement on his own during his evidence-in-chief[^405].

127    Considering the aforesaid, the Prosecution submitted that there was no reason to doubt that PW7 had faithfully and accurately recorded the Accused’s long statement (Exhibit P10). The Prosecution submitted that the material discrepancies between the Accused’s testimony and Exhibit P10, called into serious question his credibility. The only reason for the discrepancies was that he had been hiding the truth, which was that he had intended to cause hurt to PW6 with the cement scraper.

#### Stark inconsistencies pervaded the accused’s testimony

128    The Prosecution submitted that as shown in the table above, there were stark inconsistencies in the Accused’s testimony. Depending on what portions of the evidence that one relied on, the Accused had taken multiple positions on what had transpired – including but not limited to stating that he only tussled with PW6 over the first disputed broom, and later claiming that he did not tussle over the broom at all.

129    The Accused also gave multiple versions of how he was allegedly assaulted by PW6 and three other workers. Significantly, in his account to DW5 at the hospital (as documented at page 2 of Exhibit D4), the Accused did not say that he was strangled or was suffering asphyxiation (he was only grabbed by the neck and pushed down). He also denied head injury and _only_ said that he was kicked on the back, after three colleagues turned him over.

130    The Accused’s testimony in court varied in considerable details from what he had told PW5. He testified that immediately before he pushed or hit PW6 with a cement scraper, he was strangled by PW6 and PW6 pushed against a wall, and he had difficulty breathing. As for the events thereafter, the Accused claimed variously that he was kicked and punched on the back and lower back, hit on the shoulder, kicked on the left side of the body, and fell face down or face up, during which his head hit the ground. The Prosecution submitted that this was incredible, considering that clinical examination revealed that he only suffered mild pain over the upper back (near the neck region)[^406] and the lower neck[^407], and mild excoriations on the anterior neck[^408].

131    The Prosecution also noted that there were also material inconsistencies between the Accused’s testimony and what he had supposedly told his boss, DW2 and his supervisor, DW3 about the incident:

> (a)     The Accused told DW2 that after PW6 had strangled him, he was pinned down by three other men who did not attack him[^409].

> (b)     The Accused gave a different account to DW3, saying that while he was fighting with PW6, a few other workers appeared, and they all fought with him[^410]. The Prosecution submitted that it was noteworthy that DW3’s testimony in court differed from his statement to the police (Exhibit P12), wherein he said (at \[3\]) that the Accused only told him that he had a scuffle with “a dark complexion worker” over a broom, and sustained neck injury. In fact, DW3 stated at one point during cross-examination, that the Accused only told him that he had a fight with PW6 over the broom[^411].

132    The Prosecution was of the view that the fact that one could not, with any confidence, understood what precisely the Defence’s case was, spoke of one obvious point – the Accused was making up his testimony as he went along, resulting in a whole host of inconsistencies in his narrative of what had transpired.

### The Accused could not rely on Private Defence

133    The Prosecution also took the position that the Accused’s claim that he was acting in self-defence was unmeritorious.

134    The Court of Appeal in _Tan Chor Jin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 306</span> at \[46\] held that a person purporting to exercise the right of private defence of the body pursuant to sections 96 to 106 of the Penal Code would need to show the following:

> (a)     An offence affecting the human body had been committed or was reasonably apprehended;

> (b)     From an objective point of view, there was no time to seek the protection of the public authorities;

> (c)     From a subjective point of view, the person reasonably apprehended danger due to an attempt or a threat by the victim to commit an offence affecting the body; and

> (d)     The harm caused to the victim was reasonably necessary in private defence

135    The Court of Appeal also highlighted at \[46(c)\] that if the defender was the aggressor at the material time, it was _prima facie_ less likely that he had a right of private defence. Specifically, if the defender was armed with a deadly weapon from the outset, it was very unlikely that the right of private defence would ever arise.

136    The Prosecution had submitted that based on the totality of the evidence adduced at trial, _none_ of the elements of private defence were satisfied.

#### The Accused was the initial aggressor

137    In the present case, both the Accused and PW6 had given conflicting accounts. The Accused claimed that PW6 had grabbed his neck first (“**the Accused’s version**”), while PW6 had alleged that the Accused had hit him first on the mouth with a scraper (“**PW6’s version**”). On a careful reading of the evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the court should accept PW6’s version, which was both internally consistent and corroborated by multiple strands of external evidence, in stark contrast to the various inconsistencies that plagued the Accused’s evidence.

138    PW6 had testified that the Accused had suddenly hit him on the upper lip with a scraper when they were tugging at the broom. After he realised that he was bleeding on the lip, PW6 held the Accused by the throat (or grabbed his neck)[^412] and pushed him. Soon thereafter, other workers came and separated them[^413]. PW6 denied that three co-workers came to his assistance and assaulted the Accused[^414].

139    The Prosecution submitted that PW6’s version was internally consistent. In particular, he maintained the following material points, not deviating from the thrust of such evidence even during cross-examination[^415]:

> (a)     There was only one disputed broom;

> (b)     PW6 had tussled with the Accused over the broom;

> (c)     While tussling over the broom, the Accused had hit PW6 on the mouth with a scraper; and

> (d)     Thereafter, PW6 had grabbed the Accused’s throat and pushed the Accused.

140    The Prosecution submitted that PW6’s version was also externally consistent as it was corroborated by the Accused’s long statement, the evidence provided by the first responding police officer PW4, and the witness, PW5. The corroborated evidence could be summarised as follows:

> (a)     In his long statement Exhibit P10 (at \[3\]), the Accused said that he had swung his right hand, which was holding a scraper, at PW6 while they were tugging at the broom.

> (b)     PW4, who had interviewed PW6 at the scene, testified that PW6 had informed him that he got into a scuffle with the Accused over a broom, during which the Accused had hit his upper lip with a metal object[^416].

> (c)     While PW5 did not witness the actual tussle between the Accused and PW6, his testimony supported PW6’s version. Specifically, only the Accused and PW6 were involved in the tussle, and the Accused was not beaten up by PW6 and three other workers as the Accused had alleged. According to PW5, he was working nearby when he heard people quarrelling. He then went to the scene of the quarrel and saw the Accused fighting with PW6 on the ground. PW5 and other unidentified workers subsequently separated the two of them[^417].

141    Considering the aforesaid, the Prosecution submitted that the court should accept PW6’s version as true i.e., the Accused was the initial aggressor at the material time, who had first hit PW6 on the mouth with a cement scraper.

142    The Prosecution therefore submitted that no offence affecting the human body was committed on the Accused immediately before the Accused hit the victim with a cement scraper. PW6 was merely tugging at the broom and did not attempt or threaten physical harm to the Accused. The Accused had no cause to reasonably apprehend any danger to his person and did not have a right of private defence.

#### The Accused had inflicted more harm than necessary for the purpose of any alleged self-defence

143    Even if PW6 had pushed the Accused, the Prosecution was of the view that the Accused had inflicted more harm than was reasonably necessary in private defence, by hitting PW6 on a vulnerable part of the body with a dangerous weapon, causing a deep laceration on the right upper lip.

144    It was only fortuitous that PW6 did not suffer grievous hurt. If the Accused’s hand had gone any higher, the scraper could have hit PW6 in the eye[^418].

### Conclusion

145    In conclusion, the Prosecution submitted that it had proven every element of the proceeded charge beyond reasonable doubt and the Prosecution urged the court to convict the Accused accordingly.

## Defence Case[^419]

### Introduction

146    The Defence submitted that the issue before this Court were:

> (a)     Whether the Prosecution had discharged its burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Accused had the intention of causing hurt to PW6 by using the cement scraper; and, in the alternative,

> (b)     Whether the Accused had proven on a balance of probabilities that the Accused was entitled to the right of private defence.

### Analysis and assessment of the evidence

147    The Defence submitted that the Prosecution had not proven its case beyond reasonable doubt against the Accused, as the evidence adduced at trial showed that:

> (a)     The Accused had no intention to cause injury to PW6 as he was attacked by PW6 first.

> (b)     PW6 was not an unusually convincing witness and had not given credible testimony which was internally and externally consistent.

#### The Accused had no intention to cause the injury that he had caused

148    The main issue in this case was whether the Accused had possessed the necessary _mens rea_ for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt by means of a dangerous weapon.

149    The Defence submitted that the mental element required was that the Accused intended or knew it was likely that his actions would cause hurt to PW6. The knowledge required was actual knowledge. The Accused had to be subjectively aware of the likelihood of causing hurt. Rashness or negligence was insufficient[^420].

150    The subjective or actual knowledge of the Accused could be inferred from the objective acts and circumstances of the offence[^421]. Some of the facts or facts or essential facts to be taken into account when inferring intention and knowledge included[^422]:-

> (a)     Whether there was evidence of previous enmity against the party who has suffered;

> (b)     Overt act and declarations;

> (c)     Amount of violence used;

> (d)     Nature of weapon selected for the purpose; and

> (e)     Part of body, vital or otherwise, where the wound was inflicted[^423]

##### i.   The Accused had no knowledge of the scraper in his hand at the time of the incident

151    The Defence did not dispute the fact that the Accused knew that he was holding on to a scraper before the incident. However, the Defence was of the view that the Accused was not cognisant of the scraper in his hand when he was trying to get himself out of PW6’s grip on his neck.

152    Defence had submitted that tacit knowledge of what had caused injury to PW6 after the incident had taken place was distinct from the Accused's actual knowledge in the heat of the moment that he was holding on to a scraper in his right hand. The former was a realisation of what had transpired while the latter pointed towards the active state of mind of the Accused during a scuffle that had triggered a fight or flight response.

##### ii.   The Accused did not deliberately thrust the scraper towards the victim's mouth

153    While the Defence did not dispute the fact that the Accused had thrust the scraper towards PW6’s mouth, the Defence was of the view that the Accused was not cognisant of the scraper in his hand at the material time of the offence. This was evident from the following:

> (a)     When seen in context of the Accused being grabbed around the neck by PW6 at the time of the incident, the Defence submitted that it was not difficult to come to a logical conclusion that the Accused was using his free hand to push PW6 away.

> (b)     As both the Accused and PW6 were tugging on the broom which was on the Accused's left hand,it meant that the Accused's only hand which was unencumbered by PW6 was his right hand.

> (c)     The Defence submitted that there was nothing else that the Accused could have done at that point in time to get PW6 to release his hands around the Accused's neck.

> (d)     The lack of follow-up by the Accused after a single push with his right hand which resulted in PW6 releasing his grip on the Accused's neck also pointed towards the lack of intention on the part of the Accused to cause hurt to PW6. It was just an unfortunate circumstance on the part of the Accused that he was unaware of the cement scraper in his right hand.

##### iii.   No evidence of previous enmity

154    Prior to this incident, the Accused and PW6 had no previous interactions other than being workers in a common area.

155    There were no demonstrations of hatred or a desire to hurt PW6 and the Accused had no reason to hurt PW6.

##### iv.   Overt act and declarations

156    PW6 was the one who had angrily approached the Accused or confronted the Accused. This happened not just once, but twice**[^424].**

157    In the dispute that ensued, PW6 was the one who had snatched the broom out of the Accused’s hands while the Accused was trying to focus on his task.

158    PW6 had laid his hands on the Accused’s neck. The Accused had resisted and wanted to get out of the hold on his neck. The cement scraper which the Accused was holding in his right hand appeared to have hit PW6 across the lips once.

159    Further, there were no declarations or threats made by the Accused towards PW6. In fact, the only declaration made was by PW6 to the Accused, who shouted “what do you want to do?” (in Mandarin) before walking aggressively towards the Accused[^425].

##### v.   Amount of violence used and nature of weapon selected

160    The Defence had pointed out that the whole altercation between the Accused and PW6 had taken place within a few minutes. Further, at no point in time was the Accused angered during the altercation as the Accused himself had confirmed that he was not angry[^426].

161    The Accused’s first move was to push PW6 away from him. There was no intention exhibited during the pushing, that the Accused had wanted to hurt PW6[^427].

162    The Accused only realised that the cement scraper was still in his hand after he had pushed out towards PW6[^428]. The push was also in the general direction of PW6. It was not done in a particularly well thought out or directed manner[^429].

163    The manner in which the Accused had hit PW6 also did not clearly show an intention to cause hurt. The push with the cement scraper was just once, with no other intention other than to stop PW6 from grabbing his neck. This was corroborated by PW6’s statement that the Accused had only hit his face once[^430].

##### vi.   Whether the Accused knew of the danger of the cement scraper

164    The Defence submitted that in considering the nature of the weapon used and Section 324 of the Penal Code, it was important to consider whether the Accused _knew_ that he was holding a dangerous weapon.

165    The Accused would use a cement scraper in the course of his work[^431]. This was corroborated by PW6. At the material time when the Accused hit PW6, he would not have thought about whether he was holding on to the cement scraper as he was attacked first. With it being a fight or flight response, the Accused could not have anticipated the injury on PW6 as his only thought was to push PW6 away. This must be seen in the context of the Accused being grabbed around his neck, with the severity of the injuries to be elaborated below.

166    The Accused had been consistent in his statements that he did not realise that he was holding a cement scraper in his hand when giving a push to PW6 as mentioned earlier[^432]. This was consistent with PW6’s statement that the Accused was already holding on to the cement scraper before the dispute[^433]. PW5 reiterated this point when he noticed that both of the Accused’s hands were holding on to something when they first met[^434].

167    The Defence submitted that the Accused did not have the intention to cause hurt to PW6. He had only intended to stop PW6 from strangling him or to get PW6 to release his hold on the Accused’s neck.

##### vii.   Events immediately after the incident

168    Events immediately after the incident similarly did not suggest that the Accused had an intention to cause hurt. The Accused was pinned down by PW6, who held on to the Accused’s arm and pinned the Accused down with his body[^435].

169    The Accused had testified that:

> _Q:_      _Alright. So after the main contractor’s project manager told you that you need to pay for the medical expenses, what did you say?_

> _A:_      _The project manager told me that all the mops belonged to the main contractor, the subcontractor did not own any mop. He---he asked me twice, he said that I should be paying for his medical expenses. At that time, I was angry, I was very angry, since four of them had beaten me up and he still asked me whether I was going to pay for his medical expenses. At that time, I did not gave him an answer but he said, “Since you are not going to pay for his medical expenses, I will call for the police.” I then said---_

> _Q:_      _And did---_

> _A:_      _You go ahead and call the police._

170    The Defence submitted that there would have been no reason for the Accused to invite the project manager to call the police if he had any intention to cause hurt to PW6. Any reasonable person would have not wanted to get the police involved if he or she knew that there would be criminal liability.

##### viii.   PW6 had motive to frame the Accused

171    The Defence submitted that it would have made no sense for PW6 to hold the Accused’s throat and push his neck after his own lips were injured. It was beyond belief that PW6 would go nearer towards the Accused who was holding on to both a broom and a cement scraper after he realised that he was bleeding from his lip[^436].

172    The Defence was of the view that PW6 had a clear motive to lie about the true nature of the incident between him and the Accused as he knew that he might have been criminally liable for being the aggressor who had initiated the scuffle.

### Right of Private Defence

173    The Defence agreed with the Prosecution that the law relating to private defence was laid down in the case of _Tan Chor Jin v PP_.

174    In applying the principles as laid down in _Tan Chor Jin v PP_:

> (a)     On the issue of “reasonable apprehension of danger”, the Defence was of the view that the Accused had “reasonable apprehension of danger” as he was grabbed by the neck by PW6. This would constitute an offence against the Accused’s body. The abrasions on the Accused’s neck, as evidenced by Exhibits D1 and D2 and DW5’s clinical notes (Exhibit D4) and DW4’s medical report (Exhibit D3) showed that the Accused had suffered excoriations at his neck area. The Accused had reasonably apprehended ie perceived that an offence was being made against his body at the material time.

> (b)     As for the “duration of private defence”, the Defence highlighted that even by PW6’s own account, the Accused had only swung his arm _once_ at PW6’s face[^437]. There was no flurry of blows. It was therefore clear that the duration which the Accused exercised the right of private defence was commensurate to the danger which he had apprehended.

> (c)     On the issue of “use of necessary force”, the Defence pointed out that it was the Accused’s position that he did not remember that he was holding on to the cement scraper at the material time. It was also the Accused’s position that he was grabbed by the neck and pushed against the wall. Although PW6 was unarmed at the time, the neck was a vulnerable area and prolonged force exerted on the neck could have led to a serious injury or even death. It would be reasonable to assume that a person who had grabbed the Accused by the neck was intending to cause serious injury to the Accused. Also, actual injury suffered by PW6 was not that serious as PW1 had only called the police and not an ambulance, and it was the police who had called for the ambulance. The Defence also noted that PW6 was only given a short medical certificate period of 2 days, as opposed to the Accused, who was given 14 days medical leave. In addition, according to PW3, who examined PW6, PW6 had some pain but it did not seem very much at the point of the consultation[^438]. PW6 was discharged with analgesia and did not have to be hospitalised.

175    The Defence was also of the view that the Accused did not inflict more harm than necessary:

> (a)     The Accused was grabbed by the neck, which was a vulnerable part of the body. Excoriations were caused on his neck, and it was notable that this was likely caused by the scratching of fingernails.The Defence highlighted that this was pertinent as it indicated the level of force used on the Accused when he was grabbed by the neck. The Defence also noted that the Accused repeatedly used the word "strangle" in his evidence[^439]and said that he could not breathe when he had been grabbed by the neck.As such, the Accused would necessarily have been afraid for his person.

> (b)     The Defence also noted that PW6 only gave evidence of one hit by the Accused. According to PW6, they were immediately separated after PW6 gave the Accused a push.This was not a case where the Accused inflicted multiple injuries in retaliation. This was instead one instinctual movement to get PW6 to stop grabbing the Accused by the neck.

176    Given the above, the Defence submitted that the force exerted by the Accused, which involved pushing his arm towards PW6’s face whilst holding on to the cement scraper, should be considered reasonably necessary force. This would be the case even if the Accused were cognizant that he was holding onto the cement scraper.

177    The Defence emphasized that the Accused was reacting in a fight or flight scenario, and that the force used should not be weighed in golden scales. At the material time, the Accused could not have been calmly measuring the force he should have used. He reacted instinctively to protect himself.

178    The Defence therefore submitted that all the conditions of the right of private defence had been satisfied.

### Reasonable doubts in relation to Prosecution’s case

179    The Defence submitted that the following would constitute reasonable doubts in the Prosecution’s case:

> (a)     The Defence submitted that PW6’s evidence to the police was not internally consistent:

>> (i)       During his Evidence in Chief, PW6 admitted that _all_ his fingers had made contact with the Accused’s throat and that he had given the Accused a push without applying any pressure[^440]. PW6 later said that he had held the Accused’s throat and had pushed his neck and that he had told this to the police[^441]. Subsequently, PW6 denied that the neck injury was caused by him and said that he could not remember exactly where he grabbed the Accused[^442]. PW6 then changed his mind and admitted that he had grabbed the Accused on the neck[^443].

>> (ii)       The Defence also highlighted that PW6’s evidence was not internally consistent. While PW6 had admitted that he had grabbed the Accused on the neck, he had refused to admit to the possibility that the neck injury was caused by his actions. PW6 also denied that the neck injury was caused by him, claiming without evidence that other people who had pulled the Accused and PW6 apart could have caused the neck injury[^444].

>> (iii)       The Defence also submitted that PW6’s explanation of the Accused’s injuries was nothing more than an afterthought. It was incredulous that someone separating PW6 and the Accused could have caused such excoriations on the Accused’s neck but have left PW6 un-scuffed. In addition, PW6’s account appeared unbelievable. First, PW6 admitted that all his fingers made contact with the Accused’s throat. But then PW6 said that he gave a “push” without applying any pressure. The fact that all his fingers had made contact with the Accused’s throat suggested there was a clear intention to grab the Accused by the neck. It was also unclear how one could give a “push” without applying any pressure to the neck. In addition, it appeared strange that excoriations on the Accused’s neck, which were abrasions caused by fingernails, could have been caused if it had been one quick “push” without any pressure to the neck.

>> (iv)       The Defence also noted that PW6’s account of what he had said to the police was inconsistent with what the police themselves recalled. PW4 noted that PW6 appeared “reluctant to answer” when questioned about how the fight had occurred[^445]. In contrast, PW6 said that he had informed the police that he had grabbed the Accused by the neck[^446]. The Defence submitted that this was clearly an afterthought by PW6.

>> (v)       The Defence submitted that PW6 had a clear motive to lie about the true nature of the incident between him and the Accused, and to give evidence favourable to him.

>> (vi)       In light of the aforesaid, the Defence urged me to reduce the weight placed on PW6’s evidence.

> (b)     The Defence also pointed out that PW6’s evidence of how the fight occurred contradicted that of PW5**:**

>> (i)       PW5 had testified that when he witnessed the incident, the Accused and PW6 were on the ground[^447]. PW5 was quite clear that the Accused and PW6 were on the ground for about 2 minutes before they were separated[^448].

>> (ii)       In contrast, PW6 had insisted that he and the Accused **never** ended up on the ground. His account stated that they were standing throughout the whole incident[^449]. PW6 also stated that immediately after he had pushed the Accused’s throat, other workers came to separate them[^450].

>> (iii)       The Defence highlighted that PW5, as a neutral eyewitness who was not involved in the fight, would have no reason to lie about what he had witnessed. In contrast, PW6 would be motivated to lie about what had occurred in order to reduce the likelihood of criminal liability.

>> (iv)       The Defence submitted that PW6 was lying about what had occurred. If the Accused and PW6 had stopped fighting immediately after he had pushed the Accused’s throat, there would have been no need for other workers to have stepped in to separate them. In contrast, if they had been struggling on the floor for a couple of minutes, there would be a need for the other workers to step in to separate them.

>> (v)       The Defence submitted that PW5’s account appeared to be more credible. PW6 might have wanted to hide the truth behind how the Accused and himself had ended up on the ground. For instance, if he had held the Accused down or pushed him down, or if three other friends of PW6 had been present to beat up and pin the Accused down on to the ground, PW6 would have wished to steer clear of the fact that the Accused and himself had ended up on the ground.

>> (vi)       The Defence thus submitted that less weight should be given to PW6’s evidence.

> (c)     The Defence was also of the view that there were numerous procedural issues with the way the Accused’s offence was investigated. In addition, there were inconsistencies in the evidence given by the police officers:

>> (i)       As regard to the decision to place the Accused under arrest:

>>> (A)       PW7 was informed that there was a fight between the Accused and PW6[^451]. PW7 also gave evidence in court that he understood that the word “fight” to mean that there was an exchange of blows and that it was not a one-sided attack[^452]. Nevertheless, even though he was informed that there was a fight, he made the decision to place only the Accused under arrest, and not PW6.

>>> (B)       The decision appeared to have been made primarily based on PW6’s account that the Accused had attacked PW6 with a scraper and that when the Accused was questioned, he denied hitting PW6[^453].

>>> (C)       The Defence also noted that PW7 had first stated that he was aware that the Accused had complained of pain and he was conveyed to the hospital before PW7 decided to arrest the Accused[^454]. PW7 subsequently admitted that he did not know the full extent of the Accused’s injuries at the time he made the decision to arrest the Accused[^455]. PW7 then attempted to justify why he made the decision to arrest the Accused without knowing the full extent of his injuries[^456]:

>>>> _Q:_      _So, you were aware that it was a fight, and you made the decision to--- sorry, you were aware that it was a fight between 2 parties, and you made the decision to charge Mr. Zhai without knowing the full extent of his injuries?_

>>>> _A:_      _No, Your Honour. Earning---uh, clarifica---clarification was made with the---uh, the accused and the---the victim._

>>>> _Q:_      _What clarification?_

>>>> _A:_      _Statement was recorded, uh---statement was recorded with the, uh, victim again as---uh, as to---as to whether, uh, did he, uh---uh, push the-- -uh, the accused person._

>>>> _Court:_      _Sorry, I don’t quite understand your answer. So, you spoke to the victim again, is it?_

>>> (D)       The Defence was also of the view that no clear rationale was given by PW7 even after he was asked again[^457]:

>>>> _Q:_      _So you instructed PW4 and the ground officers to arrest Mr. Zhai Huilu without knowing the full extent of his injuries, correct?_

>>>> _Court:_      _So whose injuries?_

>>>> _Xiwen:_      _Sorry, Mr. Zhai Huilu’s injuries._

>>>> _A:_      _Your Honour, I made the decision to arrest, uh, the accused person after Senior Staff Sergeant Azmi bas---uh, briefed me, uh, on the facts of the case. And, uh, decision was made to arrest---to arrest the accused person._

>>>> _Q:_      _Sorry, could you repeat your answer? I didn’t catch the last bit._

>>>> _A:_      _Uh, yah, it’s after Senior Staff Sergeant briefed me on the facts of the case. And---uh, and I made the decision to arrest him---arrest the accused person._

>>>> _Q:_      _Yes, but at that point, you did not know the full extent of Mr. Zhai’s injuries, correct?_

>>>> _A:_      _Yes, Your Honour._

>> (ii)       The Defence also pointed out that the police officers at the scene had given inconsistent evidence in relation to what the Accused had informed them when questioned:

>>> (A)       PW8’s evidence was that he could not recall the Accused telling him that he had been knocked on the head[^458].

>>> (B)       In contrast, PW4 gave evidence that PW8 had translated what the Accused said to PW4 and that the Accused had said that he had taken some knocks on the head area during the scuffle. The Accused had also said that he did not see and was not sure how he obtained the knocks on the head area[^459].

>>> (C)       The Defence noted that it was PW8’s own evidence during re-examination that the case stuck with him because he rarely came across cases involving voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon[^460]. Yet, he could not recall a salient detail involving the injuries suffered by the Accused.

>>> (D)       The Defence submitted that PW8 appeared to recall more clearly the facts which he believed supported his view that the Accused was guilty of an offence.

>> (iii)       On the issue of PW7’s lack of knowledge of the Accused’s injuries:

>>> (A)       The Defence noted that PW4 had given evidence that the Accused’s injuries were photographed by one of the police officers at the scene, and that all the police officers were aware of the Accused’s injuries. PW4 also noted that the injuries on the Accused’s neck were the same as those on the photographs, Exhibits D1 and D2[^461].

>>> (B)       PW8 also observed that there were scratches on the Accused’s neck area. PW8 recalled that he had activated the paramedics, who examined the Accused’s neck area.

>>> (C)       PW7, on the other hand, had testified that his fellow policemen did not show him the photographs of the Accused’s injuries[^462]. PW7 had also interviewed the Accused one day after the incident had occurred but photographs of the Accused’s injuries were not provided to him at the time of the interview[^463]. On interviewing the Accused, PW7 had said that he did not notice any visible injuries on the Accused[^464]. However, PW7 was aware that the Accused had gone to the hospital earlier on[^465]. Nevertheless, PW7 had not bothered to ask the Accused if he was injured even though he _had knowledge_ that the Accused was sent to the hospital[^466]. When asked to justify why he though the Accused was the one at fault, PW7’s reply was that he had accepted PW6’s version of the event and he was not aware of the injuries on the Accused as he as not informed of the injuries from the officers at the scene[^467].

>>> (D)       The Defence submitted that PW7 ought to have done his due diligence in investigating the circumstances of the offence more thoroughly before making the decision to charge the Accused. Once PW7 was aware that the Accused had gone to the hospital, he should have asked the Accused where he was injured and how the said injuries occurred as well as requested the medical report from Ng Teck Fong Hospital. The fact that he did not do so and instead relied on his own evaluation of the Accused’s injuries, suggested that the investigation was not thoroughly conducted.

>>> (E)       In any event, the Defence submitted that it was implausible that PW7 had no knowledge that the Accused had been grabbed by the neck. The abrasions on the Accused’s neck were clearly visible and should have been easy to see, just one day later.

>> (iv)       The Defence also pointed out that PW7 had failed to record his initial interview with the Accused:

>>> (A)       PW7 had given evidence that he first saw and interviewed the Accused at about 6 am on 15 October 2017[^468]. The Defence submitted that the interview had lasted about **45 minutes** as the cautioned statement was recorded at 6.45am, after the interview[^469]. The oral account was not recorded in any way by PW7.

>>> (B)       The Defence submitted that the usual procedure before a statement was recorded was not followed in this case and there was no documentary evidence of what was said to PW7 during the oral interview, nor of the questions asked by PW7.

>>> (C)       It was only after the initial oral interview that PW7 decided to record a cautioned statement from the Accused. The Defence submitted that PW7’s account of the oral interview must be viewed with circumspection as there was no other record of what had actually occurred.

>> (v)       The Accused’s cautioned statement was recorded prior to his long statement:

>>> (A)       The Accused’s cautioned statement was recorded at 6.45am in the morning on 15 October 2017. His long statement was recorded at 6.50pm, close to 12 hours later[^470].

>>> (B)       PW7 admitted that he knew that the cautioned statement would generally be taken only when the police have decided to charge an accused. However, in the present case, PW7 had proceeded to record the Accused’s cautioned statement before he had recorded the Accused’s his long statement.

>>> (C)       The Defence submitted that PW7 already had a pre-conceived notion that the Accused was guilty of an offence prior to recording of his long statement. This was buttressed by the fact that the cautioned statement was recorded 12 hours before the Accused’s long statement was recorded. The Accused was also placed under arrest while PW6 was not even though PW7 knew that a fight involved an exchange of blows.

>>> (D)       With a pre-conceived notion that the Accused was guilty, PW7 might have viewed the statements made by the Accused in a different light and acted to confirm his bias.

>> (vi)       The Defence also submitted that the charge was not explained to the Accused:

>>> (A)       PW7 first gave evidence that the charge was explained to the Accused in Mandarin during his examination in chief[^471]. During his further cross-examination as a rebuttal witness, PW7 clarified that this meant he read the charge to the Accused line by line and then asked the Accused if he understood it. However, he did **not** ask the Accused to repeat it back to him to check that the Accused really understood the charge[^472].

>>> (B)       The Defence was of the view that there was a significant difference between merely reading the charge out to the Accused and explaining the charge to the Accused. The Defence submitted that by merely asking the Accused if he understood the charge, that was insufficient to prove that the Accused had indeed understood the charge.

>>> (C)       The Defence also noted that PW7 had agreed that the Accused was probably very worried by being locked up and he would likely have wanted to go home as soon as possible[^473]. The Defence highlighted that the Accused had no knowledge of the investigation procedures in Singapore and would have agreed that he understood the charge simply because he wished to speed up the process[^474].

>>> (D)       In view of the above, the Defence submitted that PW7 never properly explained the charge to the Accused. The Defence was also of the view that PW7 had taken the Accused’s statement knowing that the Accused might not have fully understood the charge.

>> (vii)       The Defence was also of the view that the Notice of Warning was not explained to the Accused:

>>> (A)       The Defence submitted that PW7 had admitted that he did not ask the Accused to explain the Notice of Warning in his own words to check whether he understood the Notice of Warning[^475].

>>> (B)       The Defence was of the view that PW7 never properly explained the Notice of Warning to the Accused. And because the Accused did not fully understand the Notice of Warning and what he was required to do, his cautioned statement was a mere few sentences. The Defence submitted that this was because the Accused had no idea what information was required in the cautioned statement.

>>> (C)       The Defence was of the view that as the cautioned statement was recorded immediately after the oral interview of 45 minutes, and the Accused might have been under the impression that he had already explained his version of the events to PW7 sufficiently.

>>> (D)       The Defence noted that even in the PW7’s account of the oral interview, the Accused had told PW7 that PW6 had pushed the Accused before the Accused swung his arm. The Accused also told PW7 that he had not injured PW5 on purpose[^476]. The Defence was of the view that even from PW7’s account, it was clear that the Accused had been reacting in self-defence after PW6 had pushed the Accused. That showed that the Accused had no intention of harming PW6.

>> (viii)       The Accused did not specifically state that he was comfortable for his statement to be recorded in English_:_

>>> (A)       The Defence highlighted that the Accused had, on numerous occasions, testified that he was unable to read or write English words. His proficiency in English was negligible and he understood only on or two words such as “yes” or “no”[^477]. The Accused had also in his re-examination testified that he was not able to read any English words[^478].

>>> (B)       There was also no interpreter present when PW7 recorded the Accused’s long statement. Accused had also testified that he was not comfortable to have his statement recorded in English[^479].

>>> (C)       The Defence submitted that it would make no sense for a person to have his statement be recorded in another language when his limited understanding of that language extended to words such as “yes” or “no”[^480].

>>> (D)       The Defence submitted that the Accused also had issues answering the learned prosecutor’s questions about his understanding of English words during his cross-examination[^481]:-

>>>> _Q:_      _Now, Mr. Zhai, I’m asking you a very, very simple question. You just agree with me that you can understand simple English word including “yes”, correct? Then why is it at earlier you told me that you don’t understand the meaning of the word “yes”? Do you have any explanation by that?_

>>>> _A:_      _This is a very simple word sometime I just use it without me knowing. I do not know anything more than that._

>>>> _Q:_      _Okay. But you are not answering my question. This is the 3rd time asking you. Wh---why---why is it that you said that you don’t understand the meaning of the word “yes”? So do you have---do you or do you not have a good explanation for that?_

>>>> _A:_      _I---and that, I’m---I’m not very certain that I understand the meaning of the word._

>>>> _Q:_      _So you are not very certain that you understand the meaning of the word “yes”?_

>>>> _A:_      _Yes._

>>>> _Q:_      _And you being not very certain with the word, actually, you used that word to reply to the Court. Don’t you find your explanation ridiculous? Yes or no? Yes or no? Isn’t your explanation ridiculous?_

>>>> _A:_      _Yes._

>>>> _Q:_      _So your explanation was ridiculous, right, you agree?_

>>>> _A:_      _That’s right._

>>> (E)       The Defence submitted that there were no reasons for the Accused, whose highest educational level was that of secondary school in China, to state that he was comfortable having his statement taken in English when he had obvious troubles and difficulties when handling English words and phrases. The Defence was therefore of the view that the Accused’s recorded statements should be given less weight due to concerns over the veracity of the statement recorded when the Accused was clearly uncomfortable with his statement being taken in English.

>> (ix)       The Defence submitted that the Accused’s statement was not accurately recorded in English by PW7_:_

>>> (A)       The Accused had no idea what was being recorded down in his statements as he had zero proficiency in English. He could also not verify what was recorded by PW7[^482].

>>> (B)       The Accused had also testified that PW7 had not recorded everything that he had told PW7[^483].

>>> (C)       The Accused also said that he did not use the word “retaliate”[^484] and “throw a punch”[^485] even though PW7 had recorded the said words in his long statement.

>> (x)       The Accused also claimed that he was not invited to make amendments to his cautioned statement or his long statement[^486].

>> (xi)       While the Prosecution was of the opinion that this was an afterthought, the Defence was of the view that this was this was consistent with the Accused’s multiple statements that he did not answer more than what he was questioned by the police.

> (d)     The Defence also submitted that DW3’s evidence was consistent with the Accused’s evidence of being assaulted and should not be discredited:

>> (i)       DW2 and DW3 were aware that the Accused had been injured around the neck as they had taken the photographs of the injuries which had been marked and admitted as Exhibits D1 and D2.

>> (ii)       DW3 had also given evidence that there was more than one person who was involved in the incident[^487].

> (e)     The Accused’s injuries were consistent with the assault:

>> (i)       The Defence submitted that the Accused’s clinical notes, marked and admitted as Exhibit D3 were contemporaneous evidence of the assault. The Accused was sent to the hospital after the incident. The first person that the Accused spoke to at the hospital was the triage nurse. The triage nurse had recorded the Accused’s complaints at 12.32 pm as: “_assaulted by colleague, strangled over neck region. Nil voice changes/ SOB. Redness over neck noted. Nil HI. Pain over lower back. Giddiness, non vertigo noted”[^488]_. DW4 also testified that what was recorded in Exhibit D4 was what the patient had informed the triage nurse[^489]. The Defence was of the view that the Accused had no reason to lie to the triage nurse.

>> (ii)       The Defence also noted that the Accused had informed DW4 who had examined him that he was “grabbed” in the neck[^490]. The Defence was of the view that a layperson’s understanding of the word “strangled” could be different from that of a doctor. DW4 had clarified that it was necessary to distinguish between the word “grabbed” or “strangled” because they “mean different things in terms of intention” to a doctor. DW4 also clarified that strangulation usually involved a manoeuvre to cause asphyxiation[^491].

>> (iii)       The Defence was of the view that a layperson’s understanding of the word “strangled” could be different from that of a doctor and the Accused’s understanding of the word “strangle” and “grab” was broader and a layman's view. As such, the Accused could have used both words inter-changeably.

>> (iv)       The Defence also pointed out that the triage nurse was not a trained physician[^492]. DW4 had also testified that it was very common for the triage nurse and the doctor at the emergency department to differ in their documentation of a patient’s complaints[^493].

>> (v)       The Defence was of the view that the account which was given by the Accused to the triage nurse should be the more accurate version as the Accused had described to the triage nurse what he believed had taken place.

>> (vi)       The Defence also submitted that the Accused’s account to DW5 also corroborated the Accused’s version of events. DW5 had corroborated the evidence given by the Accused in several material aspects. Firstly, DW5 had noted that the Accused was grabbed by the neck. DW5 had also found excoriations on the Accused’s anterior neck[^494]. This clearly supported the Accused’s evidence that he was grabbed by the neck by PW5. Secondly, DW5 noted that the Accused told him that he was pushed down and he landed on his buttocks[^495]. The Defence was of the view that this corroborated the Accused’s account of events. Thirdly, DW5 noted that the Accused had been turned over by three other colleagues and they then kicked his back[^496]. This corroborated the Accused’s account that three other people had also assaulted him, other than PW6. Fourth, the pain over C7 spine and thoracic spine indicated that there was indeed some injury to the Accused’s back. In addition, there was some pain over the C7 spine (neck region) when the Accused turned to the left[^497]. This corroborated the Accused’s account that he felt pain on his back after the incident.

### Conclusion

180    Having regard to the above, the Defence submitted that:

> (a)     The Prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had been made out; and, in the alternative,

> (b)     Even if the offence had been made out, the Accused had proved the right of private defence on a balance of probabilities.

181    The Defence also submitted that the Prosecution had not proved a material element of the offence, namely, that the Accused had intended the injury which was caused. The Defence reiterated that the Accused had consistently given evidence that he had not been cognizant of the fact that he was holding onto a cement scraper when he swung his hand at PW6.

182    In addition, the Accused was reacting to an offence made against his body, namely, the grabbing of his neck by PW6. The Defence was of the view that the conditions of the right of private defence had been made out as the Accused did not have the time to contact the authorities.

183    Given the above, the Defence submitted that the court should acquit the Accused of the charge.

## My findings and decision

### The law and elements of the charge

184    The relevant statutory provisions in relation to the current charge were as follows:

> “**Hurt**

> **319**.    Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt.

> _Explanation._ — A person is said to cause hurt if he causes another person to be unconscious.

> **Voluntarily causing hurt**

> Whoever does any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person, and does thereby cause hurt to any person, is said “voluntarily to cause hurt”.

> **Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means**

> **324**.    Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt by means of any instrument for shooting, stabbing or cutting, or any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, or by means of fire or any heated substance, or by means of any poison or corrosive substance, or by means of any explosive substance, or by means of any substance which is harmful to the human body to inhale, to swallow, or to receive into the blood, or by means of any animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.”

185    In the present case, in order to secure a conviction against the Accused, the Prosecution would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that:

> (a)     The Accused had used a cement scraper to hit PW6 once on the mouth;

> (b)     The Accused had done the act with the intention to cause hurt or with the knowledge that he is likely to cause hurt to PW6; and

> (c)     The cement scraper was an instrument which, if used as a weapon of offence, was likely to cause death.

### Applicable law in reviewing the evidence

186    In the present case, it was clear evidence that the Accused had hit PW6 once in the mouth with a cement scraper and that had caused a laceration on PW6’s upper lip involving the vermillion border. This was evident from the testimony of both the Accused and PW6 as well as PW2 and PW3 who had examined PW6 and the Exhibits P2, P3, P4, P10 and P11.

187    Both parties also did not dispute the fact that the Accused had used a cement scraper to hit PW6 on his lip which had resulted in the laceration on PW6’s lip.

188    As for the cement scraper, it was clear from the evidence that the actual cement scraper which was used to cut PW6’s lip was not found. However, PW4 had taken a photograph of another cement scraper which was found at the scene[^498]. The Accused had also confirmed that the scraper that he had used was similar to the one which photograph taken by PW4, but it had a different handle[^499].

189    I noted that the scraper was made of metal and the end that was used to scrape things was able to cause a deep cut into PW6’s lip. I would agree with the Prosecution that the end that was used to scrape things must have been very sharp in order to be able to cause such a deep cut into PW6’s lip.

190    And given the nature of the scraper with its sharp end, I was of the view that the scraper used in this case was an instrument which was likely to cause death when used as a weapon of offence.

191    On the issue of whether the Accused had the intention to cause hurt to PW6, the Prosecution’s position that the Accused had the intention to cause which was likely to cause while the Defence’s position was that the whole incident was an accident and the Accused did not have any intention to cause hurt to PW6. Alternatively, the Defence had submitted that PW6 was the aggressor who had attacked the Accused first and the Accused was merely exercising his right of private defence when he hit back at PW6.

192    I also noted that both parties had different versions of what had taken place including the number of encounters between the parties, what had happened during the encounter and the number of people who were involved.

193    As both the Accused’s and PW6’s evidence were at the opposite end of the spectrum, I would need to embark on a thorough and rigorous analysis of the evidence adduced in the course of the trial to determine who was telling the truth.

194    On the issue of credibility of a witness, the Honourable Yong Yung How CJ (as he then was) had in the case of **_Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_** (“**_Farida Begam_**_”_) <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span> given some insight as to how a judge could make a finding on the credibility of a witness.

195    In **_Farida Begam_**, Yong Pung How CJ had held at \[9\] that a judge could make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all the following:

> (a)     His demeanour;

> (b)     The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence; and

> (c)     The external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and the extrinsic evidence.

196    It was also clear that where there was no other available evidence other than that of the victim, a victim’s evidence must be _“unusually convincing”_ in order to constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt. In **_AOF v Public Prosecutor_** <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> (“**_AOF_**”), the Court of Appeal had stated at \[111\] – \[115\]:

> “111.  **It is well-established that in a case where no other evidence is available, a complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt** (see s 136 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”)) – **but only when it is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration** (see generally the decision of this court in _PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> at \[37\]–\[44\] (“Liton”) and the Singapore High Court decision of _XP v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 686</span> at \[27\]–\[36\] (“XP”)).

> 112.  The need for “fine-tooth comb” scrutiny in so far as allegations of sexual abuse are concerned is particularly acute, “given both the ease with which allegations of sexual assault may be fabricated and the concomitant difficulty of rebutting such allegations” (see the Singapore High Court decision of _Chng Yew Chin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 124</span> at \[33\], cited with approval in _Liton_ at \[37\]–\[38\]).

> 113    In _XP_, V K Rajah JA observed (at \[31\]) that the requirement that the alleged victim’s evidence ought to be “unusually convincing”:

>> … does nothing, however, to change the ultimate rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but it does suggest how the evidential Gordian knot may be untied if proof is to be found solely from the complainant’s testimony against the Appellant.

> \[…\]

> 115    Moving from the level of scrutiny to the elements of what an unusually convincing testimony consists of, i**t is clear that a witness’s testimony may only be found to be “unusually convincing” by weighing the demeanour of the witness alongside both the internal and external consistencies found in the witness’ testimony.** \[emphasis added\]

197    At \[173\], the Court of Appeal provided further guidance on what constituted corroborative evidence:

> 173    It is settled law that where the evidence of the complainant is not “unusually convincing”, an accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s story. This requirement was laid down in Federation of Malaya High Court decision of _Public Prosecutor v Mardai_ <span class="citation">\[1950\] MLJ 33</span> where Spencer- Wilkinson J declared (at 33), as follows:

>> Whilst there is no rule of law in this country that in sexual offences the evidence of the complainant must be corroborated; nevertheless, it appears to me, as a matter of common sense, to be unsafe to convict in cases of this kind unless either the evidence of the complainant is unusually convincing or there is some corroboration of the complainant’s story. **It would be sufficient, in my view, if that corroboration consisted only of a subsequent complaint by complainant herself provided that the statement implicated the Appellant and was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence.**

> The EA did not, at its inception, provide a definition of corroboration and still does not do so. In _Liton_ (\[111\] _supra_), this court (at \[43\]) preferred Spencer-Wilkinson J’s more liberal approach to corroboration (“liberal corroboration”) as opposed to the stricter traditional common law definition laid down in _The King v Baskerville_ <span class="citation">\[1916\] 2 KB 658</span> at 667 (“_Baskerville_”) of independent evidence implicating the Appellant in a material particular (“_Baskerville_ corroboration”):

>> \[I\]t is clear that the Baskerville standard … does not apply in its strict form in Singapore since Yong CJ, in _Tang Kin Seng_ (\[37\] supra), advocated a liberal approach in determining whether a piece of evidence can amount to corroboration. This is so, notwithstanding Yong CJ’s apparent allusion to the whole or part of the Baskerville standard in _B v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 400</span> (at \[27\]); _Lee Kwang Peng_ (\[38\] supra) at \[71\]; and _Kwan Peng Hong_ (\[37\] supra) at \[37\] as being ‘essential’ in nature. In our view, to adopt a stringent definition of what constitutes corroborative evidence goes against the liberal approach which Yong CJ himself alluded to as a broad principle of law in the other cases. In _Kwan Peng Hong_ (at \[36\]), Yong CJ held that our courts ‘have left behind a technical and inflexible approach to corroboration and its definition’, and alluded to similar pronouncements in _Tang Kin Seng_ (at \[53\]– \[68\]) and _Soh Yang Tick_ (\[37\] supra at \[43\]). The principle of law which emerges from these cases is that **the local approach to locating corroborative evidence is liberal**, thus ensuring that the trial judge has the necessary flexibility to treat relevant evidence as corroborative. **What is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate.**

>> \[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold\]

198    It was also well established that minor inconsistencies in a witness’ testimony, could be disregarded if his testimony was substantially consistent and the minute details that varied did not discredit the witness. This was observed by CJ Yong Pung How (as he then was) in **_Lim Thiam Hor and Anor v PP_** <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 758</span>:

> “ \[M\]oreover, the **discrepancies could be explained by the simple reason that no two persons can describe the same thing in the same way. In weighing the evidence of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court**: see _Chean Siong Guat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span>. The question was whether the alleged discrepancies were sufficient to destroy the credibility of PW1 and PW3. There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its entirety or not at all. A court is thus fully competent to accept one part of the witness’ testimony and to reject the other. **The testimony given by the prosecution witnesses were substantially consistent and the minute details that varied did not discredit them.** On the evidence, the findings by the trial judge were supportable on the facts and the discrepancies pointed out by the appellants were minor and not material.”

> \[emphasis added\]

### My assessment of the evidence

199    In my evaluation of the evidence, I was prepared to accept the Prosecution’s position that the Accused had intended to hurt PW6 using the cement scraper or that he had the knowledge that what he had done was likely to cause hurt to PW6.. As for the Accused, I disbelieved his account of the events that had taken place and I did not accept his story that PW6 was the aggressor and that he had hit PW6 accidentally or unintentionally. I was also not prepared to accept the Accused’s argument that he was entitled to exercise his right to private defence in this situation. I was also not prepared to accept the Accused’s story that he was assaulted by 3 other co-workers. My reasons were as follows:

#### PW6’s evidence was materially consistent

200    I was of the view that PW6’s evidence was both internally and externally consistent. Save for a few minor inconsistencies which were not material, PW6’s evidence was consistent throughout the trial. I also noted that his story remained the same despite cross-examination by Defence Counsel and he came across as a consistent and truthful witness.

201    PW6 had testified that he was cleaning the interior of unit #XXX on level 20 of Block 448A[^500] on the day of the incident and as part of his work, he needed to use a broom, rags and chemicals (thinners)[^501]. PW6 had left his broom outside the gate of unit #XXX[^502]. When PW6 had finished cleaning unit #XXX, he needed the broom to clean up the floor of the unit[^503]. PW6 tried to look for his broom but he could not find it. PW6 then saw the Accused taking the broom away[^504]. PW6 went up to the Accused and asked the Accused to return his broom to him and the Accused told him the broom belonged to the Accused[^505] and he refused to return the broom to PW6[^506].

202    At that time, PW6 saw that the Accused was holding the middle part of the broom with his left hand with the head of the broom facing downwards and he was holding a scraper in his right hand[^507]. The scraper was facing upwards[^508]. PW6 then tried to take back the broom and he held on to the top and the bottom of the broom and the 2 of them started tugging the broom back and forth[^509]. The 2 of them were trying to pull the broom towards themselves and they were facing each other and standing very close to each other when they were doing that.

203    Suddenly, the Accused pushed up his right hand and he hit PW6’s right upper lip with the metal scraper[^510]. PW6 testified that the speed that the Accused had pushed the scraper towards him was very fast[^511]. After the Accused had hit PW6 on his lip, PW6 saw that his lip was bleeding, and he realised that his lip had been cut by the metal scraper[^512].

204    When PW6 saw that his lip was bleeding, he released his left hand from the broom, and he used his left hand to hold or grab onto the Accused’s throat[^513]. PW6 confirmed that all his fingers made contact with the Accused’s throat.[^514] PW6 said that he did not apply pressure on the Accused’s throat and he had merely pushed the Accused. PW6 said that he had done the act out of anger[^515]. PW6 was not sure who had caused the Accused’s injury, but he was of the view that he did not cause the injury to the Accused’s neck[^516]. PW6 also did not observe if the Accused had any injury to his neck at that point of time because he was concentrating on his own injury[^517]. A short while later, a few workers came and separated the 2 of them[^518]. PW6 also recollected that he did inform PW4 that he had held onto the Accused’s throat and that the other workers had separated them[^519]. PW6 also said that both he and the Accused were standing during the altercation and both did not fall onto the ground during the altercation[^520]. PW6 also said that no other workers were involved in the scuffle between him and the Accused[^521].

205    PW6’s story was corroborated by PW4 who had testified that he had spoken to PW6 at the scene and PW6 had informed him that he was doing touch up work at level 20 and he wanted to use his broom. PW6 could not find his broom and he saw the Accused with the broom. There was a scuffle with them, and the Accused had used a metal object (“scraper”) to hit his lip[^522].

206    PW5, a witness who was also working on level 20 on the day of the incident, also corroborated PW6’s story that there were no other workers involved in the scuffle between the Accused and PW6. PW5 testified that he was cleaning tiles in one of the units on level 20 when he heard people quarrelling and having verbal arguments[^523]. PW5 immediately went to check out the source of the argument and he took less than 1 minute to determine the source of the argument. PW5 saw only the Accused and PW6 struggling with each other and they were holding onto each other in a hugging manner and rolling around on the floor in the area marked in Exhibit P5(c)[^524]. PW5 also saw other workers trying to separate the 2 of them[^525]. PW5 also informed PW4 of the same when PW4 visited the scene on the day of the incident[^526].

207    PW6’s account of events to PW3 was also materially consistent. After the incident, PW6 was brought by some of the workers to the canteen which was located next to their office[^527]. A short while later, the police arrived and PW6 was taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital by ambulance[^528]. At the hospital, PW6 was treated by PW3. PW6 informed PW3 that he was involved in a fight at his workplace[^529] and the other person had used a cement scraper to slice his lip[^530].

208    I also noted one discrepancy between PW6’s testimony and that of PW5. PW6 had recalled that when he had scuffled with the Accused, both were on their feet and they did not fall onto the ground[^531]. However, PW5 had testified that he saw both rolling on the ground when they were scuffling with each other. I was of the view that the fact whether the parties were standing or on the ground was not material as both views took the position that there was a scuffle between the parties. I was of the view that this was a minor inconsistency which could be disregarded as the rest of PW6’s his testimony was substantially consistent, and this fact did not discredit PW6 (see **_Lim Thiam Hor and Anor v PP)_**.

#### The Accused’s evidence had material inconsistencies

209    The Accused’s defence was that PW6 was the aggressor who had attacked him first and he did not realise that he was holding onto the scraper when he tried to push PW6 away and he did not intend to cause hurt to PW6. The Accused had also argued that he was acting in self-defence as PW6 was the aggressor.

210    I have gone through the Accused’s evidence and I was of the view that there were material inconsistencies in the Accused’s evidence:

211     The Accused’s evidence in court – In his EIC, the Accused had testified to the following:

> (a)     On 14 October 2017, the Accused and PW6 were initially both was working in unit #XXX[^532]. The Accused did not have a broom of his own and he used a broom which he had found at unit #XXX[^533]. The broom had belonged to PW6. PW6 saw the Accused using his broom and he wanted the broom back. The Accused had wanted to user the broom for a while longer but PW6 refused to let him have the broom and he took the broom away from the Accused[^534].

> (b)     After the Accused had finished his work at unit #XXX, he went to work at unit #XXX[^535]. PW6 was still in unit #XXX when the Accused went over to unit #XXX[^536].

> (c)     After PW6 had taken the broom away, the Accused went to look for another broom. The Accused found another broom at the other end of the common corridor of level 20 and he had wanted to use the broom to complete his work[^537]. The Accused was making his way back to unit #XXX with the new broom when he was confronted by PW6 and 3 other workers who were standing outside unit #XXX.

> (d)     PW6 asked the Accused in Mandarin “What do you want?”[^538]. PW6 then shouted at the Accused “What are you trying to do”[^539] and he walked towards the Accused, strangled his neck and pushed the Accused against the wall next to the metal gate of unit #XXX[^540].

> (e)     The Accused started having difficulty breathing when PW6 used his right hand to strangle the Accused[^541] and the Accused used his right hand to push PW6 away[^542]. At that time, the Accused forgot that he was holding onto the scraper and he accidentally hit PW6’s lip with the scraper.

> (f)     When that happened, PW6 and the 3 workers attacked the Accused. PW6 used his left hand to grab the Accused’s right forearm and one of the 3 workers who was with PW6 grabbed the Accused’s left hand which was holding onto the broom[^543]. The worker then used both his hands to pull the Accused’s left hand causing him to turn around towards his right side and face the other side of the corridor[^544]. The other 2 workers, who were standing behind the Accused started kicking and punching him from behind in the back and lower back[^545].

> (g)     PW6 and the worker who was holding onto the Accused’s left hand then dragged the Accused to the floor. The Accused was pushed backwards, and he fell to the ground[^546]. As the Accused was falling to the ground, he was hit on the shoulder[^547]. After that, the Accused was beaten by the 4 men for about 3 to 5 minutes before the other workers cane to separate them[^548].

> (h)     When the other workers came to separate them, the other 3 workers moved away to the other side of the lift lobby. However, PW6 continued to hold onto the Accused’s arm and body and pinned him down[^549].

> (i)     By the time the Accused managed to get up from the ground, all the 4 attackers had left the scene and they had gone down to the canteen area[^550]. After that, DW3 went up to the 20th floor and asked the Accused to go to the canteen area with him[^551]. The 2 of them went down to the canteen area where they met up with the project manager from the main contractor[^552]. The project manager asked the Accused why he had gotten into a fight and the Accused told him that the 4 men had attacked him first[^553]. The project manager told the Accused that the broom belonged to the main contractor[^554]. The project manager also told the Accused that even though the 4 men had beaten up the Accused, he had caused serious injury to them and he should pay for their medical fees[^555]. The Accused was angry with the project manager and he refused to answer the project manager[^556].

> (j)     When DW2 arrived at the canteen, he asked the Accused why he had gotten into a fight and the Accused told him that he had used their broom but PW6 had strangled him first and the 4 men had beaten him up[^557]. DW2 then suggested to the Accused to pay for half of the medical fees but the Accused did not agree to the proposal [^558]. The project manager then told the Accused that since he was not going to pay PW6’s medical fees, the project manager would proceed to call the police and the Accused told him to go ahead to call the police[^559]. After that, the project manager asked PW1 to contact the police[^560]. DW2 also noted the Accused’s injury on his neck and he took a photograph of the same[^561].

> (k)     When the police arrived, PW8 spoke to the Accused and he asked the Accused twice as to what he had used to cause such serious injury to PW6[^562]. The Accused said that he did not answer PW8 because he was beaten up and all PW8 was asking was what he had used to injure PW6[^563]. The Accused had refused to answer PW8 because he felt that that was not fair and PW8 had also not asked him for the reasons[^564].

> (l)     Other than PW8, ASP Paulus also spoke to the Accused. ASP Paulus had asked the Accused as to why he had gotten into a fight and the Accused told him that he was attacked by 4 men. The Accused said that he also described how the attack took place to ASP Paulus[^565]. The Accused said that he informed ASP Paulus that 2 of the men had grabbed his shoulder and arm and the other 2 men had kicked and punched him before he fell to the ground. The Accused said that he informed ASP Paulus that the 4 men had beaten him for 3 to 5 minutes and when he fell to the ground, his body had landed first followed by his head[^566].

> (m)     I also found it very strange that when the Accused was questioned by PW8 at the scene, he was unable to recall how the incident had happened but he could recollect clearly what had happened at the scene when he was giving evidence in court more than 1 year after the incident.

> (n)     The Accused also said that he had informed the paramedic that he was attacked on his back and he was strangled, and he felt pain in several places[^567]. The Accused also said that he had informed the paramedic of the location of his pain and that he had felt pain in some areas on his back[^568]. The Accused also said that he told the paramedic that he was attacked by a few persons[^569]. I noted the paramedic’s conditioned statement that he could not remember what had happened on that day[^570].

> (o)     The Accused also said that when he was being arrested and handcuffed, he told the arresting officer that he needed to see a doctor and he was taken to the hospital by way of ambulance. The Accused also said that he had informed the officer who had handcuffed him that he had been beaten up. The Accused could not remember which officer he had told this do as there were 2 officers who had arrested him[^571]. I noted that 2 police officers had assisted in the arrest of the Accused and the 2 officers were SSGT Ridhwan and PW8[^572].

> (p)     At Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, the Accused told DW5 that he was beaten on his back and there were areas where he had felt pain. As for his neck injury, the bleeding had stopped by the time he had reached the hospital. The Accused also told DW5 that he was strangled[^573].

212    I noted that there were material inconsistencies between the Accused’s EIC and what was recorded in Exhibit P10:

> (a)     In Exhibit P10, the Accused had told PW7 that there was only 1 broom incident. However, in his EIC in court, the Accused had alleged that there were 2 broom incidents involving 2 different brooms.

> (b)     In Exhibit P10, the Accused had told PW7 that he had tussled over the broom with PW6 but in his EIC in court, the Accused did not mention of any tussle with PW6 over the broom.

> (c)     In Exhibit P10, the Accused had told PW7 that PW6 had pushed him during the tussle and he had swung his right hand towards PW6 in retaliation. During his EIC in court, the Accused said that PW6 was the sole aggressor who had attacked the Accused and strangled his neck and had pushed him against the wall. The Accused had used his hand which was holding the scraper to push PW6 away because he was having difficulty breathing. I agreed with the Prosecution that, during his cross-examination, the Accused kept changing his position to whether he had tussled with PW6 over the broom. Initially, the Accused said that there was no tussle over the broom. However, he subsequently changed his story to say that he did tussle with PW6 over the broom before changing his position again to say that there was no tussle[^574].

> (d)     In Exhibit P10, the Accused had told PW7 that he had swung his right hand at PW6 because he wanted to throw a punch at PW6. However, in his EIC in court, the Accused said that he had merely pushed PW6 with his right hand as PW6 was strangling him and he was having difficulty breathing.

> (e)     In Exhibit P10, the Accused told PW7 that after he swung his hand at PW6, they had a scuffle and were pulled apart by other workers. However, in his EIC in court, the Accused said that he was assaulted by PW6 and 3 other workers who were with PW6.

213    I also noted that there were also material discrepancies between the evidence of the other witnesses (including the Defence witnesses), the exhibits tendered and the Accused’s evidence in court:

> (a)      The Accused’s account of how he was attacked by PW6 and the other 3 workers:

>> (i)       In his EIC, the Accused had testified that PW6 had used his right hand to strangle the Accused and caused him to have difficulty breathing. The Accused used his right hand to push PW6 away and he accidently hit PW6 in the lip with his scraper. PW6 then used his left hand to grab the Accused’s right forearm and one of the 3 workers who was with PW6 had grabbed the Accused’s left hand which was holding onto the broom and had used both his hands to pull the Accused’s left hand causing him to turn around towards his right side and face the other side of the corridor. The other 2 workers then started kicking and punching him from behind in the back and lower back. PW6 and the worker who was holding onto the Accused’s left hand then dragged the Accused to the floor. The Accused was pushed backwards, and he fell to the ground. As the Accused was falling to the ground, he was hit on the shoulder. When the Accused fell, his body landed on the ground first followed by his head. After that, the Accused was beaten by the 4 men for about 3 to 5 minutes before the other workers cane to separate them. When the other workers came to separate them, the other 3 workers moved away while PW6 continued to pin him down.

>> (ii)       During cross-examination, the Accused said that he fell to the ground and landed on his buttocks first before his head hit the ground. One of the attackers then grabbed his arm with great force and turned him over. He was then pinned to the ground and beaten up by the other three assailants who hit him on the shoulder.

>> (iii)       However, DW5 who had examined the Accused, testified that the Accused told him that he had fought with his colleague over a broom and he was grabbed by the neck and pushed down and he landed on his buttocks. After that 3 other colleagues turned him over and the Accused felt someone kick his back. DW5 also testified that the Accused had never told him that he was hit on his shoulder and strangled by his colleague. The Accused also told DW5 that he did not suffer any neck or head injury when he landed on his buttocks. DW5 also said that the Accused did not inform him that his head had landed on the ground and that he had landed on his lower back. The Accused also did not inform DW5 that he was beaten on his back, he said he was kicked. The Accused also did not inform DW5 that he could not see properly. DW5 also said that the Accused did not tell him that he was pushed against a wall or that he was kicked and punched before he fell to the ground and that 4 persons had pinned him down.

>> (iv)       The Accused had also told PW4 that during his scuffle with PW6, he had felt some knocks on his head area, but he did not see how he was hit in the head.

>> (v)       I also noted PW5’s testimony that he had proceed to the source of the quarrel and verbal arguments in less than 1 minute (as opposed to the 3 to 5 minutes that the Accused said he was attacked by the 4 workers) and he only saw the Accused and PW6 struggling with each other on the ground and other workers trying to separate them. PW5 did not mention that there were 3 other workers attacking the Accused.

>> (vi)       I noted that the Accused’s long statement in Exhibit P10 did not state that the Accused was strangled by PW6 and that he was attacked by 3 other persons other than PW6. PW7 who had recorded Exhibit P10 also testified that the Accused had never informed him that he was strangled by PW6 or that he was attacked by 3 other persons.

>> (vii)       The Accused also did not mention that PW6 was the aggressor who had attacked the Accused first and that he was attacked by 3 other workers in his cautioned statement Exhibit P9.

>> (viii)       I also noted that the Accused did not mention in his Case for the Defence (Exhibit P11) that PW6 had tried to strangle him but he merely stated that PW6 had grabbed his neck. Exhibit P11 also did not state that the Accused was attacked by 3 other workers. In this regard, I noted that during the trial, the Accused’s previous counsels had informed me that they had decided not to include this point into Exhibit P11 and they had subsequently proceeded to discharge themselves from further acting for the Accused as they could be called as Defence witnesses on this issue[^575]. I also noted that the Accused’s previous counsels were not called to testify on this issue after the Accused had appointed new counsels to act for him.

>> (ix)       I agreed with the Prosecution that there were material inconsistencies between the Accused’s testimony and what he had told his boss DW2 and DW3 about the incident:

>>> (a)       The Accused had informed DW2 that after PW6 had strangled him, he was pinned down by three other men. He did not inform DW2 that he was attacked by the other three men.

>>> (b)       DW3 had in his EIC testified that the Accused had told him that while he was fighting with PW6, a few other workers appeared, and they all fought with him. I noted that the Prosecution had applied to impeach DW3’s testimony in court with his statement that he had given to the police earlier (Exhibit P12). In Exhibit P12, D3 had told PW7 that the Accused had informed him that he had a scuffle with a dark-complexioned worker. DW3 did not inform PW7 in Exhibit P12 that the Accused had told him that he was attacked by 3 other workers. Given all these, I was of the view that DW3’s evidence was unreliable.

214    The Accused’s injuries did not commensurate with the manner which the Accused had claimed he was attacked by PW6 and the other 3 workers:

> (a)     DW4 and DW5 had testified that the injuries suffered by the Accused included mild tenderness over his cervical and upper thoracic spine. The Accused also suffered from mild excoriations in the anterior neck and mild pain with neck movements to the left[^576].

> (b)     The Accused had also complained to DW5 that he was having mild pain over the C7 spine and thoracic spine which referred to the lower part of the neck as well as the middle-upper part of the middle back.

> (c)     DW5 had noted that there were “no neck swelling, no difficulty swallowing, no neck pain” which meant that DW4 did not observe any visible or palpable swelling in the Accused’s neck and the Accused did not complain of any difficulty when swallowing his saliva or water. DW5 also examined the Accused’s head and found no obvious visible injuries such as lacerations, haematomas or bruising.

> (d)     DW5 had examined the Accused’s neck and he found that the Accused did not have any severe pain over his C7 spine as well as his middle back. When DW5 examined the Accused’s spine, the Accused informed DW5 that he felt pain when DW5 touched his C7 spine and the upper part of the thoracic spine which was about 1 to 3 cm below the C7 spine. DW5 explained that this was around the shoulder blade area.

> (e)     DW5 also did not observe any physical injuries on the posterior part of the Accused’s neck and back. There was also no chest pain observed.

> (f)     I was of the view that the injuries recorded of the Accused were clearly inconsistent with the manner in which the Accused was alleged to have been assaulted by PW6 and the other 3 workers. If the Accused had been punched and kicked on his back and lower back for 3 to 5 minutes by 4 persons, it was highly unlikely that there were no external injuries such as bruises or abrasions on the Accused’s body and back. If the Accused had been grabbed and pushed down and landed on his buttocks, it seemed strange that his injuries were only restricted to his neck and shoulder blade region. And if the Accused was dragged to the floor in a forceful manner and had been hit on the shoulder and had also hit his head on the ground, it seemed strange that there were no external injuries to his shoulder area as well as his head region.

215    I also accepted all the inconsistencies in the Accused’s testimony as pointed out by the Prosecution in their Closing Submissions.

216    Given the above, I was of the view that the Accused’s testimony was both internally and externally inconsistent. As such, I would disregard the Accused’s evidence and accept PW6’s evidence on the chain of events which had taken place on the day of the incident.

217    As such, I was not prepared to accept the Accused’s evidence that PW6 was the aggressor who had tried to strangle the Accused first and that the Accused was merely defending himself. I would accept PW6’s evidence that both of them had fought over the broom and the Accused had used to scraper to hit at PW6 and caused the cut on PW6’s lip. And it was only after the Accused had cut PW6’s lip that PW6 went on to grab the Accused by the neck and thereby causing the excoriation on the Accused’s neck. Both parties then struggled with each other and they fell to the ground in a hugging manner[^577].

218    For my reasons as stated above, I was also not prepared to accept the Accused’s version of events, which was that there were 2 encounters between the parties over brooms and that during the second encounter, PW6 had suddenly attacked the Accused and tried to strangle him and the Accused had cut PW6’s lip accidently when he tried to defend himself. Subsequently PW6 and 3 other persons had attacked the Accused.

#### Whether the Accused intended hurt to result from his action or knew that it was likely that hurt would result from his action

219    In the present case, I would agree with the Prosecution that the irresistible inference was that the Accused had intended to cause hurt or that he knew that his action was likely to cause hurt to PW6.

220    The Accused had given evidence that he was holding onto the scraper in his right hand and holding onto the broom in his left hand just before the incident[^578]. His story was that he had forgotten that the scraper was in his hand when the incident happened.

221    I would agree with the Prosecution that it was evident from Exhibits P5(f) and P5(g) that the scraper was not a small item but an item of significant length. The scraper was a solid and heavy piece of tool with a solid metal blade which was used to scrape things from floor tiles. Given all these, I would agree with the Prosecution that it was quite incredulous that the Accused could momentarily forget that he was holding onto such an instrument when he was confronting PW6.

222    I also agreed with the Prosecution’s observation that shortly after the incident, when interviewed by the police officers at the scene, the Accused had claimed that he could not recall the details of his scuffle with PW6 and he had also refused to answer the police when asked if any weapon was used during the scuffle. PW8 had testified that he had asked the Accused several times about the details of the scuffle, but the Accused claimed that he could not recall what had happened.

223    In this regard, I also noted that the Accused had also given a one-sided view of events to DW5 who had examined him at the hospital. The Accused also did not inform DW5 that he had cut the lip of PW6 with a metal scraper during their scuffle.

224    I also agreed with the Prosecution’s observation that in court, when asked why he did not tell the police the truth, the Accused could not provide a logical explanation. The Accused initially claimed that the police officer did not ask him how the incident took place, before alleging that he was asked the questions in a “very fast manner”.

225    Given the above, I would agree with the Prosecution that the irresistible inference was that at all material times, the Accused knew that he was holding the scraper in his right hand.

226    On the issue of whether the Accused had intended to use the scraper on PW6, I would agree with the Prosecution that the manner that the scraper was thrusted towards PW6’s mouth clearly suggested a deliberate act of aggression, rather than accidental or defensive in nature. PW6 had testified that the Accused had suddenly pushed his right hand, which was holding the scraper, in a fast upward motion towards PW6’s mouth.

227    The Accused had also in his long statement (Exhibit P10) at \[3\], said that he and PW6 were both tugging at the broom, during which PW6 pushed him, and he retaliated by swinging his right hand, which was holding a scraper, towards PW6.

228    If the Accused had just wanted to push PW6 away, he could have just pushed his hand straight towards the PW6 in order to do that. There was no need for the Accused to swing his hand in an upward manner towards PW6’s face. The Accused’s action clearly showed that he was swinging the scraper at PW6 and he was aiming at PW6’s head. Such actions would strongly suggest an intention to cause hurt to PW6 at his head area.

229    Given the above, I would agree with the Prosecution that the manner and target area of the attack (i.e. the face) which was a vulnerable part of the body, clearly pointed to the fact that the Accused had intended to cause hurt to the PW6.

#### Whether the Accused can rely on Private Defence

230    Section 97 of the Penal Code provides the right of private defence:

> **“Right of Private Defence of the body and of property**

> **97**.    Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in sections 98 and 106A, to defend —

>> (_a_)    his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body;

>> (_b_)    the property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.

> **Extent to which right may be exercised**

> **98.**—(1)    The right of private defence does not extend to the inflicting of more harm than it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.

> (2)    There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is reasonable opportunity to have recourse to the protection of a public authority in the circumstances.

_Illustrations_

> (_a_)     _Z_ ambushes _A_ in a secluded area and attempts to kill _A_. _A_ kills _Z_ while fending off _Z_’s attack. _A_ is guilty of no offence because, in the circumstances, _A_ had no reasonable opportunity to have recourse to the protection of a public authority.

> (_b_)     _Z_ ambushes _A_ in a secluded area and attempts to kill _A_. _A_’s right of private defence arises because, at that point of time, _A_ had no reasonable opportunity to have recourse to the protection of a public authority. In the midst of the struggle between _A_ and _Z_, a police patrol car arrives on the scene. _A_’s right of private defence ceases the moment _A_ had reasonable opportunity to have recourse to the protection of the police.”

231    I accept that the Court of Appeal in _Tan Chor Jin v PP_ had clearly spelt out the principles relating to private defence. VK Rajah JA, in delivering the grounds of decision of the court, had stated at \[46\]:

> _“46_      _We would also add that, on a more faithful rendition of ss 96–106 of the Penal Code, a modified sequence of the conjunctive requirements which must be satisfied in order to establish the general exception of the right to private defence of the body (as adapted from Yeo, Morgan & Chan (\[14\] supra) at para 20.48) is as follows:_

>> (_a_)     _Save for the situation where the defender is defending himself against an act of a person of unsound mind (see s 98 of the Penal Code), the defender must show that an offence affecting the human body has been committed or is reasonably apprehended. This is to conform to the first of the preconditions mentioned at \[39\] above, viz, s 97 of the Penal Code._

>> (_b_)     _The defender must show that there was no time to seek the protection of public authorities. This is to conform to the second precondition stated at \[39\] above, viz, s 99(3) of the Penal Code. The test for whether the defender had time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities is an objective one. In this regard, it should be noted that the Indian cases appear, quite correctly, to equate the words “time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities” (see s 99(3) of the Penal Code) with “reasonable opportunity of redress by recourse to the public authorities” (see Law of Crimes (\[16\] supra) at p 406). Further, the defender should not be expected to seek the protection of the public authorities if the time needed to do so would result in the mischief being completed (see The Indian Penal Code (\[37\] supra) at p 459)._

>> (_c_)     _If the defender was the aggressor at the material time, it is prima facie less likely that he had a right of private defence (cf the Indian position, which seemingly makes no room at all for a defender/aggressor to invoke this right (see \[44\] above; see also The Indian Penal Code at p 411)). Much would depend on the factual matrix of the case: if, for instance the defender was armed with a deadly weapon from the outset, it is very unlikely that the right of private defence would ever arise._

>> (_d_)     _The defender must prove that, at the time of acting in private defence, he reasonably apprehended danger due to an attempt or a threat by the victim to commit an offence affecting the body. This is a subjective test (the Indian position is the same in this regard (see The Indian Penal Code at p 406))._

>> (_e_)     _Where the defender has killed the victim, he has to prove that the offence which occasioned the exercise of the right of private defence was one of the offences listed in s 100, namely:_

>>> (_i_)     _an assault “as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise be the consequence of such assault” (see s 100(a));_

>>> (_ii_)    _an assault “as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous harm will otherwise be the consequence of such assault” (see s 100(b));_

>>> (_iii_)    _an assault with the intention of committing rape (see s 100(c));_

>>> (_iv_)    _an assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust (see s 100(d));_

>>> (_v_)     _an assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting (see s 100(e)); and_

>>> (_vi_)    _an assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for his release (see s 100(f))._

> _If the defender is unable to show that he exercised his right of private defence owing to one or more of the offences listed in s 100, his right of private defence will not extend to the causing of the victim’s death, although s 101 would still permit him to cause “any harm other than death” to the victim._

> (_f_)     _The defender must prove that the harm caused to the victim was reasonably necessary in private defence. Due allowance should be given to the dire circumstances under which the defender was acting._

> _This approach seeks to strike an appropriate balance between criminally harmful conduct and justifiably harmful conduct arising out of the defence of the person. We would like to stress that, notwithstanding the foregoing guidelines, whether the right of private defence has arisen and, if so, whether it has been exceeded in a particular case ultimately depends on all the relevant circumstances of the case.”_

232    According to the Court of Appeal in _Tan Chor Jin v PP_, any person who wished to exercise the right of private defence of the body pursuant to sections 96 to 106 of the Penal Code must show the following:

> (a)     That an offence affecting the human body had been committed or was reasonably apprehended against that person;

> (b)     That person did not have time to seek protection from the public authorities;

> (c)     From a subjective point of view, that person had apprehended danger due to an attempt or a threat by the victim to commit an offence affecting the body; and

> (d)     The harm caused by that person to the victim was reasonably necessary in private defence.

233    The Court of Appeal in _Tan Chor Jin v PP_ had also highlighted at \[46(c)\] that if the defender was the aggressor at the material time, it was _prima facie_ less likely that he had a right of private defence. Much would depend on the factual matrix of the case: if, for instance the defender was armed with a deadly weapon from the outset, it was very unlikely that the right of private defence would ever arise.

234    In the present case, I would agree with the Prosecution that the Accused would not be able to rely on the private defence for the following reasons:

> (a)      There was no offence committed by PW6 on the Accused’s body. The Accused was the one who had attacked PW6 first by using his metal scraper to cut PW6’s lip while they were tugging over the broom. PW6 then reacted by grabbing the Accused in his neck in his own defence. There was also no evidence that the Accused was attacked by 3 other workers after his encounter with PW6.

> (b)      The Accused was the initial aggressor at the material time. As the Accused was the aggressor, it was prima facie less likely that he would have a right to private defence. Moreover, in the present case, the Accused was armed with a metal scraper while PW6 was unarmed.

> (c)      The Accused had also inflicted more harm than necessary for the purpose of any alleged self- defence. In the present case, even if PW6 had pushed the Accused, that did not justify the Accused’s use of a metal scraper to cut PW6’s lip. It was clear to me that the harm caused by the Accused was excessive and unreasonable given the circumstances. I would agree with the Prosecution that it was fortuitous that PW6 did not suffer any injuries which were more serious. If the Accused’s hand had gone higher, he could have caused injuries to PW6’s eye or other part of the head.

### My decision

235    In _Public Prosecutor v Liew Kim Choo_ \[1997\] 3 SLR 699, Yong Pung How CJ in quoting Lord Diplock in the leading case of _Haw Tua Tau v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1981\] 2 MLJ 49</span> \[at 57\]:

> “57.  As Lord Diplock stated in the leading case of _Haw Tua Tau v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1981\] 2 MLJ 49</span> :

>> “For reasons that are inherent in the adversarial character of criminal trials under the common law system, it does not place upon the court a positive obligation to make up its mind at that stage of the proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution has by then already satisfied its beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Indeed it would run counter to the concept of what is a fair trial under that system to require the court to do so.”

> 58.    The prosecution must, at the end of trial, go beyond what it must show as the close of the prosecution’s case. At the close of the prosecution’s case, the prosecution need only raise a prima facie case which, if uncontradicted by the defence, would justify a conviction. That case could be made out of proved facts or reasonable inferences drawn from the proved facts. The nature of the inferences as to the primary facts must be drawn at the close of the prosecution’s case were described by Lord Diplock in _Haw Tua Tau_ as follows:

>> “for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s 189(1) the court must act on the presumption (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.”

> 59.    For obvious reasons, in deciding the issue of guilt at the close of the trial, this standard will not suffice. The evidence must be subjected to the highest not lowest standard of scrutiny. The facts proved by the prosecution must therefore satisfy the trial judge beyond reasonable doubt that the correct inference to be drawn from those facts is that the accused person is guilty. The trial judge is not allowed to act on the presumption that the primary evidence is true. Nor is he to make only a minimal assessment – to decide if the necessary inferences “would reasonably be drawn”. He must make a maximum assessment…

> 60.    I therefore had to consider the evidence afresh, without reference to my conclusions in the first appeal, which conclusions were premises on a different standard of proof”

236    The issue of burden of proof was also considered in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 48</span> where the Court of Appeal \[ at 34\] commented:

> “34    …in relation to the requisite burden of proof, it needs no reminding that the burden lies squarely with the Prosecution to prove the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As Rajah JA said in _Sakthivel Punithavathi_ (\[32\] supra at \[78\]):

>> Whatever is thought about the myriad objectives of criminal punishment, one fundamental principle has been hailed as a cornerstone both at common law and in the Evidence Act (Cap 97 1997 Rev Ed): before an accused can be convicted of a crime, his guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This bedrock principle is sacrosanct in our criminal justice system and constitutes a fundamental right that the courts in Singapore have consistently emphasised and upheld as a necessary prerequisite for any legitimate and sustainable conviction: see, for example, _Jagatheesan_ \[\[66\] supra\]; … _Took Leng How v PP_ \[2006\] 2 SLR (R) 70.

> Indeed, the trial judge also alluded to this important principle in his judgment in respect of the second trial (see _Mohammed Liton (No. 2)_ (\[30\] supra)). At \[4\] of that judgment, he stated that:

>> Unlike civil cases, where the court may choose between competing stories and accept the one on a balance of probabilities, that is to say, accepting that version because it seemed more plausible than the other, in a criminal case, there is an important norm to be taken into account at all times – that where there is a reasonable doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused. _It is inherent (in) the requirements that the prosecution proves its case beyond reasonable doubt._ \[emphasis added\]

> 35.    As to what proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” (per Rajah JA in _Sakthivel Punithavathi_ (\[32\] supra) at \[78\] means, we would endorse the definition accepted by him in _Jagatheesan_ 9\[32\] supra at \[55\]), viz, the description **of “reasonable doubt“ as “reasoned doubt” \[emphasis in original \] – which in turn mandates that all doubt, for which there is a reason relatable to and supported by the evidence present, be taken into account in favour of the accused**. Reasonable doubt might also arise by virtue of lack of evidence submitted, if such evidence is necessary to support the Prosecution’s theory of guilt: see _Jagatheesan_ at \[61\]. Indeed, the trial judge also similarly referred to such a meaning of the standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” in his judgment in respect of the second trial (see _Mohammed Liton (No 2)_ (\[30\] supra at \[41\]):

>> **What this means is that unlike a civil case, the court’s verdict might not merely be determined on the basis that as between two competing stories, which version was the more plausible one. In a criminal case, the court may find … the complainant’s story to be more probable than that of the accused person’s version, and yet, be convinced that there is a reasonable possibility that the accused’s person’s story could be true. If that were the case, the court’s duty is to acquit**. Unlike a civil case, the court need not make a decision by concentrating on which one of the two versions was more probable. In a criminal trial the court must remind itself to break away from any habitual inclination to contemplate the question of the burden of proof on the basis of a civil case, and instead, ask itself whether there is a reasonable possibility that the accused person’s version was true. (emphasis mine)

237    In the present case, having considered all the evidence before me, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proven their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I accordingly convicted the Accused of the charge.

### Issues raised by the Defence

238    I also wished to address some of the issues raised by the Defence in their closing submissions[^579] :-

> (a)     The Defence had alleged that there were issues with the way the police had investigated the matter. The Defence had suggested that PW7 had failed to properly investigate the matter and that he had decided that the Accused was guilty of an offence at a very early stage of investigation and he had failed to conduct a thorough investigation in order to determine exactly what had happened. In this regard, the Defence had given the following examples:

>> (i)       PW7 had decided to place the Accused under arrest even before he had completed his investigation.

>> (ii)       PW7 did not properly investigate the cause of the Accused’s neck injuries.

> (b)     The Defence also alleged that PW7 had committed the following mistakes when he recorded the Accused’s cautioned and long statements:

>> (i)       PW7 had failed to explain the Charge and Notice of Warning to the Accused when he recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement.

>> (ii)       PW7 had recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement before he recorded the Accused’s long statement.

>> (iii)       PW7 had recorded the Accused’s statements in English without any interpreter present when the Accused was unable understand or to read or write English.

>> (iv)       PW7 had also wrongly recorded what the Accused had told him, and he had also failed to record down some things which the Accused had told him during the taking of the statements. Also, PW7 had also added things into the Accused’s statement which was not said by the Accused.

>> (v)       PW7 had also failed to read and explain to the Accused in Mandarin what he had recorded from the Accused and he had also failed to allow the Accused to make amendments to both his cautioned and long statements.

> (c)     The Defence also took issue with the fact that PW7 had failed to record his initial interview with the Accused, which interview was conducted before he recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement and long statement.

239     With regard to the way the police had conducted their investigations, I noted that PW7 had conferred with some of the police officers who had responded to the First Information Report P1 (including PW4, PW8 and ASP Paulus) before deciding to place the Accused under arrest. The officers at the scene had also interviewed the parties involved and the witnesses before giving their feedback to PW7 before he ordered the arrest of the Accused. It was clear to me that this was not a case that PW7 had decided to place the Accused under arrest summarily without doing any investigation works.

240    As regard to the Accused’s injuries, although PW7 had given evidence that he did not notice any injuries on the Accused’s neck when he recorded the Accused’s statements, I noted that PW7 had recorded a witness statement from DW3 on 22 October 2018 and DW3 had informed PW7 that he had seen bruises on the Accused’s neck and he had taken photographs of the Accused’s injuries.

241    While investigations were conducted by PW7, who was the investigating officer, the investigation papers with all the findings and exhibits (including evidence relating to the Accused’s injuries) would have to be submitted to the Attorney General’s Chambers when they were completed in order for the Public Prosecutor to decide whether to charge the Accused in court. The job of the investigation officer, PW7, was to collate all the evidence and to make recommendations to the Public Prosecutor and the Public Prosecutor was the final authority in deciding whether to charge the Accused in court for any offence. The Public Prosecutor would also have to study all the evidence that have been collected before coming to any decision to charge the Accused in court for the relevant offence.

242    In the present case, other than the bare allegations made by the Defence, I have not seen objective evidence to suggest that the whole process from investigation to charging the Accused in court had been compromised in any way by what PW7 had allegedly failed to do. As such, I was of the view that these were bare and baseless allegations. I was also of the view that this was an unnecessary attack on the integrity of PW7 by the Accused.

243     As for the Accused’s ability to read and understand the English language:

> (a)     The Accused had claimed that he was unable to speak or understand English and was uncomfortable to have his statements recorded by PW7 in English but PW7 had proceeded to do the same. The Accused had also alleged that he had never told PW7 that he was comfortable for his long statement to be recorded in English during the recording of his long statement. The Accused had also alleged that he had no idea what was recorded in his statements as he had zero proficiency in English.

> (b)     Having observed the Accused’s demeanour during the trial, I was unable to accept the Accused’s contention that he was not able to speak or understand the English language. During the trial, I had observed the Accused reading the exhibits that were placed before him when he was asked questions relating to the exhibits[^580]. I had also observed, on several occasions, the Accused listening to his counsel’s and the learned Prosecutor’s questions which were asked in English and answering their questions even before they were translated into Mandarin by the court interpreter[^581]. The Accused had also given his answer on one occasion in the English language. All these had happened both during his examination-in-chief as well as during cross-examination[^582]. This clearly showed that the Accused was able to read and understand English. My observation of the Accused was quite different from what he was trying to portray to the court, that he was unable to understand the English language at all and he only knew one or two words such as “yes” or “no”.

> (c)     The Accused had also alleged that PW7 had failed to properly explain the charge and the Notice of Warning to him when he was recording the Accused’s cautioned statement. PW7 had, in his EIC, testified that he had explained the charge and Notice of Warning to the Accused. During cross-examination, PW7 also said that he had read and translated the charge and Notice of Warning line by line to the Accused and asked the Accused if he understood and the Accused had acknowledged that he understood both. The Defence submitted that PW7 had failed to ask the Accused to repeat back to him to check if the Accused really understood. The Defence was of the view that view that there was a significant difference between merely reading a charge to the Accused and explaining the charge to the Accused and that merely asking the Accused if he understood the charge was insufficient to proof that he had understood the charge. With due respect, I would disagree with the Defence on this point. I was unable to see the difference between “reading and translating the charge in Mandarin” and “explaining the charge in Mandarin” in that situation.

> (d)     PW7 was effectively bilingual and this was not disputed by the Defence. When a person has translated something line by line in Mandarin to another person and the person to whom it was translated acknowledged that he understood the translation, that clearly showed that that person had understood what was being explained to him. I also noted that when PW7 was called as a rebuttal witness, he gave evidence that he did read and explain both the charge and the Notice of Warning to the Accused. I also noted that the Accused had, in the course of his testimony, confirmed that his cautioned statement was accurately recorded, and he understood the nature of the charge after it was read and explained to him.

> (e)     The Accused’s cautioned statement also showed that the Accused knew that “whatever he needed to inform the Court” was recorded at page 3 of the cautioned statement (Exhibit P9) and that clearly corroborated PW7’s testimony that the notice of warning was administered to the Accused, and that he understood the same.

244     As for PW7’s recording of the Accused’s long statement, the Accused had made the following allegations against PW7:

> (a)     PW7 had failed to read and explain the statement to the Accused in Mandarin after he recorded the statement and he also did not give the Accused a chance to amend his statement.

> (b)     The Accused alleged that in the recording of his long statement, the Accused did not use the word “retaliate” but PW7 had recorded the word “retaliate” in his long statement. The Accused also alleged that he did not use the word “I threw a punch” but PW7 had recorded those words in his long statement. The Accused also said that he told PW7 that he had forgotten that he was holding onto the metal scraper and he did not have the intention to cause hurt to PW7 but PW7 had failed to record all these into his long statement.

245     As for PW7’s recording of the Accused’s cautioned statement, the Accused had made the following allegations against PW7:

> (a)     PW7 had failed to read and explain the charge to the Accused before he recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement.

> (b)     PW7 also did not read and explain the Notice of Warning to the Accused before he recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement.

> (c)     After PW7 had recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement, he did not read and explain the statement back to the Accused in Mandarin and he also did not give the Accused a chance to amend the statement

> (d)     The Accused had informed PW7 during the recording that he was strangled by PW6 and that he was beaten up by 3 other workers. However, PW7 had failed to record all these into his cautioned statement.

> (e)     The Accused had told PW7 that he did not hurt PW6 intentionally but PW7 had failed to record this into his cautioned statement. Instead, PW7 told the Accused that he could go to court and tell the judge if he had anything to say.

246    PW7 had had given evidence that he had explained the charge and the Notice of Warning to the Accused before he started recording the Accused’s cautioned statement.

247    PW7 had also testified that he had recorded everything that the Accused had told him and he had translated whatever he had recorded in Mandarin to the Accused for both the statements and the Accused had agreed to what was recorded before he went on to sign his statements.

248    PW7 had also testified that he had also invited the Accused to make amendments to his statements in both the statements, but the Accused did not wish to make any amendments to the same.

249    Given that the Accused was able to read and understand English, I found it difficult to believe that if PW7 had failed to record anything that the Accused had told PW7 in any of the statements, that the Accused would not have requested him to correct that position.

250    I noted that both the Accused’s statements were recorded on 15 October 2017 and the Accused was charged in court on 16 October 2017. The Accused was assigned pro-bono counsel on 20 February 2018 and the matter was fixed for hearing starting 8 November 2018. Although the Accused was not given his long statement prior to trial, he was given a copy of his cautioned statement much earlier on. I also noted that even though the Accused had been assigned counsel to represent him, he had never raised the fact that the charge and Notice of Warning were not properly explained to him, that PW7 had failed to interpret to him in Mandarin to him what was recorded, that PW7 had not failed to record the fact that there were 3 other workers who had attacked him and that PW7 had fail to allow him to make any correction or amendments to his cautioned statement before the matter went to trial. The Accused had also not raised these issues in his Case for the Defence.

251    PW7 was merely carrying out his job as an investigation officer. PW7 had also not seen the Accused before he was assigned to investigate this matter. There was also no history of bad blood between the two of them. There was no reason for PW7 to want to get the Accused into trouble by doing all those things as alleged by the Accused.

252    Given the above, I would agree with the Prosecution that these were all afterthoughts raised by the Accused after he had realised that there were statements recorded from him which could hurt him in his defence of the matter.

253     As for PW7 recording the Accused’s cautioned statement before his long statement, I noted that there were no provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code which had stipulated that the Accused’s cautioned statement could only be recorded after the Accused’s long statement had been recorded.

254     As for PW7 not recording the Accused’s first interview, I accepted PW7’s explanation that after the initial oral interview, he did not immediately put everything down in a long statement format because he was called to respond to another case. Consequently, PW7 decided to record the Accused’s cautioned statement first (which took relatively less time) and to record the Accused’s long statement later. I also agreed with the Prosecution that during the subsequent recording of his long statement, the Accused did not add anything to what he had said earlier that day.

255    I also agreed with the Prosecution that there were sufficient grounds to arrest the Accused for an offence under section 324 of the Penal Code, and the arrest was in accordance with the procedure under section 17 of the CPC, when an arrestable offence was suspected. In the present case, the police officers at the scene had interviewed both parties and witnesses.

256    It was also very clear that PW6 had informed the police that the Accused had cut his lip with a metal scraper. The Accused, on the other hand, had claimed that he could not recall any detail relating to the incident despite being questioned several times by the responding officers. The Accused also refused to answer the police when asked if any weapon was used during the scuffle. Given all these, I would agree with the Prosecution that was sufficient reasonable grounds for the police to believe that the Accused had committed the said offence and to arrest the Accused and report the matter to the Public Prosecutor under section 17(1)(b) of the CPC.

257     The Defence also alleged that there were material inconsistencies in the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses:

> (a)     The Defence had submitted that there were material inconsistencies between the evidence of PW5 and PW6 in that PW5 had testified that PW6 and the Accused were hugging each other and rolling on the ground whereas PW6 had testified that they never fell to the ground.

> (b)     I agreed with the Defence that there were inconsistencies in the evidence of PW5 and PW6 and I was prepared to accept PW5’s evidence that both PW6 and the Accused had fallen onto the ground as PW5 was an independent witness who had nothing to gain from his appearance in court. However, I did not share the Defence’s views that such an inconsistency was material in nature. I would agree with the Prosecution that the inconsistency was a minor/immaterial inconsistency which was not fatal to PW6’s credibility. What was more material about PW5’s evidence was the fact that he had made his way to the scene in less than one minute after he heard the commotion and he did not see any other workers attacking the Accused.

> (c)     Regarding PW8’s inability to recall what the Accused had told him at the scene, I would agree with the Prosecution that this should not be held against PW8 in assessing his credibility as human fallibility in recollection was common and understandable.

258     On the issue of PW6 not being a honest witness, I agreed with the Prosecution that PW6 had come clean on his role in the incident and he did admit that he had either held or grabbed the accused by the neck and had pushed him after he realised he had been cut by the metal scraper. As for PW6 not answering PW4’s questions relating to the Accused’s injuries, I agreed with the Prosecution that nothing would turn on that. I accept that PW6 would have been concentrating on his own injuries and he would not be paying any attention to the Accused’s injuries which were minor compared to his injuries.

## Accused’s antecedents

259    I noted that the Accused did not have any criminal antecedents.

## Sentencing

### Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

#### Prosecution’s sentencing position

260    The Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least seven months’ imprisonment for the offence.

#### The applicable sentencing framework

261    In determining the appropriate sentence, the Prosecution pointed out that the High Court in _Ng Soon Kim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1097</span> (“_Ng Soon Kim_”) had adopted a three-step sentencing approach (at \[12\]):

> (a)     First, an indicative starting point would be derived based on the seriousness of the injury caused to the victim i.e., the indicative sentence if the charge had been under s 323 of the Penal Code. Notably, where minor lacerations or abrasions are caused (i.e., “low harm”), the indicative sentencing range were fines or short custodial term up to four weeks, and where “moderate harm” was caused, the indicative sentencing range was between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment (_Ng Soon Kim_ at \[13\]).

> (b)     Second, the indicative starting point should be adjusted upwards for the dangerous means used. In this regard, an uplift of six months’ imprisonment was imposed in _Ng Soon Kim_ (at \[16\]) for the use of an ignited aerosol spray, and in _PP v Muhammad Syafiq bin Mohamed Abbas_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 114</span> (“_Muhammad Syafiq_”) (at \[42\]) for the use of a multi-purpose knife.

> (c)     Third, the Court should calibrate the final sentence according to the various aggravating and mitigating factors.

262    In the present case, the Prosecution highlighted that the Accused had inflicted a deep laceration on PW6’s right upper lip with a cement scraper, which was a sharp instrument capable of causing serious injuries. The horrific nature of the injury was self-evident from the photograph exhibit. Considering that PW6’s injury was of greater severity than the injuries classified under “low harm” (e.g. minor laceration), the Prosecution submitted that the starting point should be an imprisonment term of at least four weeks’ imprisonment.

263    The second step was to consider a suitable uplift for the dangerous means used. In _Muhammad Syafiq_, where the offender was charged under section 326 of the Penal Code for stabbing the victim’s chest with a multi-purpose knife, the Court (in applying the sentencing approach in _Ng Soon Kim_) imposed an uplift of six months’ imprisonment after considering the inherently dangerous nature of the knife that was used. The Court opined (at \[42\]) that if an ignited aerosol stream in _Ng Soon Kim_ could attract an uplift of six months’ imprisonment, the uplift for a multi-purpose knife should (in the ordinary course of things) be pegged at no less than that.

264    Considering the aforesaid, the Prosecution submitted that a similar uplift of at least six months’ imprisonment to the starting point should be imposed in this case where the weapon used was a sharp instrument capable of causing serious injuries.

265    For the third step, the Prosecution submitted that there were no mitigating factors in this case. The lack of premeditation in this case only amounted to the absence of an aggravating circumstance, and not the existence of a mitigating circumstance (_PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> at \[63\]).

266    The Prosecution submitted that the present case contained the following aggravating factors that warranted a deterrent sentence:

> (a)      The assault on PW6 was vicious: The viciousness of the assault on PW6 was evident from the deep laceration the Accused had inflicted on PW6’s right upper lip, and his targeting of a vulnerable part of PW6’s body i.e., the face. Further, it was outrageous for the Accused to hit PW6 on the mouth with a cement scraper over a mere broom. The Prosecution submitted that general deterrence was a dominant sentencing principle in such cases of violent offences, as it was necessary to signal that the law should not condone violence as a solution to problems, no matter how personal they might be, or how angry or justified one might feel (_PP v BPK_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 755</span> at \[11\]).

> (b)      Public disquiet: The assault had taken place at a construction worksite, in the presence of many co-workers and would have resulted in public disquiet, which was an aggravating factor that warranted a deterrent sentence (_PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[25(c)\]).

267    Given the aggravating factors in the present case, the absence of mitigating factors, and the need for general deterrence, the Prosecution submitted that an appropriate sentence for the section 324 offence would be at least seven months’ imprisonment.

268    The Prosecution also highlighted that their proposed sentence was at the lower end of the range of imprisonment terms imposed in section 324 cases involving the use of sharp weapons. The Court in _PP v Ong Boon Sim_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 308</span> at \[24\] had observed that the sentences imposed for such cases were usually between six months and three-and-a-half years. The Prosecution therefore submitted that their proposed sentence was not manifestly excessive.

#### Conclusion

269    In conclusion, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least seven months’ imprisonment was appropriate for the proceeded charge against the Accused.

### Mitigation[^583]

270    The Defence submitted that the Accused deeply regretted his actions and was pleading for leniency. In particular, the Defence urged me to consider the following factors:

> (a)     Compassionate grounds;

> (b)     No antecedents; and

> (c)     Evidence of good character.

#### A.   Compassionate grounds

271    The Defence highlighted that the Accused had worked for Tian Di Engineering Pte Ltd since December 2016. The Accused was the primary caregiver for family who resided in China. He had two aging parents who relied solely on his income for their survival. The Accused’s wife was unemployed. He also had a 15-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son, both of whom were still schooling.

272    Given the above, the Defence submitted that a long custodial sentence for the Accused would leave his family in a precarious situation as they would be left without his income.

273    Additionally, the Accused had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the Accused was infected by the virus while living in one of the largest foreign worker dormitories in Singapore. In August 2020, he was moved from the foreign worker dormitory to his work site dormitory. However, the impact of contracting the COVID-19 virus still caused him body aches and pains, making it difficult for him to work to support his family.

#### B.   No previous antecedents

274    The Accused was untraced and had no prior convictions_._

#### C.   Evidence of good character

275    The Defence submitted that the Accused’s offence, which he deeply regretted, was out of character

276    The Defence had received a glowing testimonial from his employer which had testified for his good character. The testimonial pointed to the Accused’s high social standing amongst his peers and co-workers and the present incident was totally out of character for him and not reflective of him as a person[^584].

#### D.   Loss of employment

277    The Defence submitted that it was trite law that a loss of employment is a mitigating factor. In _Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 523</span>, the court had emphasized that loss of employment, all related financial benefits and career progression are part of the circumstances that the court would consider in assessing sentence.

278    In the present case, the Accused’s employers had indicated that they were prepared to continue employing the Accused if his employment pass could be renewed, given his consistent work performance over many years. However, a conviction in this case was likely to affect the Accused’s ability to continue working in Singapore. The Defence urged me to consider the likely loss of employment as a strong mitigating factor.

### Defence’ Submission on Sentencing

279    The Defence had submitted for a sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment. The Defence was of the view that the sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment would be consistent and congruent with recent case law and appropriate given the Accused’s circumstances.

280    The Defence had tendered the following sentencing precedents in support of their sentencing proposal:

281    I also noted that the Defence was in agreement with the Prosecution that the sentencing framework in _Ng Soon Kim_ was the proper framework to be adopted for section 324 cases in which a first-time offender pleaded guilty.

282    In applying the _Ng Soon Kim_ framework, the Defence submitted that the present case should fall under the upper end of Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ sentencing framework given the nature of the injury suffered by PW6. As such, the indicative starting sentence should be no more than 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

283    In considering a suitable uplift, the Defence submitted that the weapon used by the Accused in the present case was a cement scraper and a cement scraper was not ordinarily used for cutting or stabbing. While the cement scraper was still inherently dangerous, the uplift should be less than that of sharp and long instruments such as knives and cutting instruments. As such, the Defence was of a view that an uplift of **4 months** would be appropriate in the present circumstances.

284    Finally, with regard to calibrating the sentence, the Defence submitted that the Accused was a first-time offender and that factor should be given much weight. Taken in totality, the Defence was of the view that an appropriate sentence for the present case is not more than 5 months’ imprisonment.

285    The Defence also noted that the Prosecution had put forth the following aggravating factors which warranted a deterrent sentence, specifically:

> (a)     That the assault on PW6 was vicious; and

> (b)     That there was public disquiet.

286    The Defence disagreed with the aggravating factors. The Defence noted that while the Prosecution had cited the case of _PP v BPK (“BPK”)_ for the proposition that general deterrence was the dominant sentencing principle in cases of violent offences, the case of _BPK_ related to a charge under section 307 Penal Code for attempted murder causing hurt. In the present case, the charge related to one of causing hurt with a dangerous weapon where the sentencing considerations were wholly different than that in _BPK_**.**

287    Further, while the assault on PW6 did result in a deep laceration on PW6’s right upper lip, the Defence submitted that it would be presumptuous to label it as vicious when the Accused himself had also suffered superficial excoriations from PW6’s grabbing of his throat.

288    Additionally, the Accused only committed a single act leading to the laceration on PW6’s right upper lip. In contrast, in the case of _Hamid_, the accused had stabbed his wife 24 times at various parts of her body. The victim in _Hamid_ had suffered 24 lacerations. The number of attacks was a factor to be taken into account by the courts when determining the viciousness of the attack. The Defence felt that it was an exaggeration to call a single attack by the Accused vicious.

289    Secondly, in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 33</span>, the court had held that certain crimes, in addition to harming their immediate victims, also had the wider-felt impact of triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public. Thus, a deterrent sentence was necessary and appropriate to quell public disquiet and the unease engendered by such crimes. The Defence submitted that a fight taking place in a construction site could not be said to “_offend the sensibilities of the general public_” when the case of _Law Aik Meng_ was referring to crimes such as bribery which would concern the wider public, or offences which involved a public institution.

290    In addition, the Defence submitted that a fight occurring at one floor of a construction site was a different scenario from a fight which had occurred at, for instance, a “_busy road intersection_”, such as in the case of _Ng Soon Kim_, where that “_might have given rise to some public alarm_”. The number of people who could potentially have seen such a fight was limited to the construction workers who would have had access to the construction site, as opposed to the general public.

291    The Defence submitted that the Accused was truly repentant and remorseful for what he has done. The Accused also assured the Court that he would not commit any offences again.

292    Based on the reasons stated above, the Defence urged me to temper justice with compassion by imposing a sentence of not more than 5 months’ imprisonment.

### My Sentence

293    The punishment prescribed under section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) was imprisonment for a term which could extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

#### Sentencing principles under section 324 Penal Code

294    In **_Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor_** <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span> 216 (“**_Ng Soon Kim_**”) at \[12\]– \[13\], the Honourable the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon had laid out the steps that a sentencing court should take when dealing with a section 324 Penal Code case:

> “12     _In these circumstances, I approached the task of arriving at an appropriate sentence for an offence under s 324 in the following manner. First, I considered_ **_what would be an appropriate sentence had the hurt alone been the subject of an offence under s 323._** _Second, I then considered the_ **_application of a suitable uplift, having regard to the dangerous means used_** _. In this connection, I considered it appropriate, as a matter of principle, to have regard to the potential harm that could result from the chosen means of offending. This seemed to me to follow from the fact that some of the dangerous means prescribed in s 324 were identified by reference to their potential for causing harm, such as means likely to cause death, when in most cases brought under the provision death will not in fact have been caused. Finally, I then_ **_calibrated the sentence to what I considered was appropriate having considered the aggravating or mitigating circumstances at play_** _._

> _13_      _The High Court in_ **_Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_** _<span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“_ **_Low Song Chye_** _”) recently laid down the following sentencing framework in s 323 cases for a first-time offender who pleaded guilty:_

295    The editors of **Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis and the Subordinate Courts, Singapore, 2003)** had also commented at \[page 240\]:

> “This is an aggravated form of the offence of simple hurt because it involves the use of weapons or other wicked means. The maximum imprisonment term that can be imposed for this offence was increased to 7 years, pursuant to the Penal Code (Amendment) Act. Any combination of imprisonment, fine and caning can also be imposed under the amended provision, when only a combination of two of those punishments could be imposed previously, The factors which would influence the sentencing disposition and length of sentence would be similar to the offence of hurt simpliciter except that the courts have to throw into the balance the very significant factor of the use of the weapon or heated substance, etc. As regards the weapon or the other means, the court would note its nature and the degree of premeditation involved in procuring it. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, imprisonment is the norm. The actual length of the sentence turns on the unique facts of each case. The obvious aggravating factors would be **premeditation, a lengthy application of violence, group assault, serious injuries, the use of a deadly weapon, or wicked means like fire, corrosive substance or poison, and previous convictions**.”

296    In applying the principles as laid down in _Ng Soon Kim_:

##### Step 1 - The notional starting sentence had this been a case under section 323 Penal Code

297    PW6 had suffered a deep laceration on the right upper lip involving the vermillion border and he had suffered upper lip pain and mild right supraorbital tenderness and he was given two days of medical leave[^585]. Exhibit P4 showed very clearly how deep the laceration was. I was of the view that the injury to PW6 was not a minor injury. If the Accused had been charged under section 323 Penal Code, this case would have fallen within the lower end of Band 2 of the sentencing framework in _Low Song Chye._ Under the first step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ framework, the starting sentence should be pegged at around 1 months’ imprisonment.

##### Step 2 - The appropriate uplift to account for the weapon used

298    Under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ framework, I would need to give regard to the means used to inflict the injuries and the potential harm that could result from the chosen means of offending (_Ng Soon Kim_ at \[12\]). The more inherently dangerous the weapon or means, the greater the potential harm and the higher the level of egregiousness (_Ng Soon Kim_ at \[11\]).

299    In the present case, the Accused had used a cement scraper as the weapon of choice. The cement scraper had a strong metal blade with a sharp edge and the metal blade was designed to scrape materials off walls and floors. The cement scraper was also very sturdy as it was made for industrial use. Given its sharp blade and its sturdy nature, I was of the view that the cement scraper was akin to a sharp cutting instrument. The cement scraper, if used as a weapon of offence, was inherently dangerous and carried great potential for harm and could even cause death. The Accused had also attacked PW6 at a vulnerable part of his body which was his head area.

300    Give the above facts, I was of the view that a suitable uplift would be a 6 month’ uplift, given that the cement scraper was an inherently dangerous weapon. Adding this to the starting point of 1 months’ imprisonment would raise the total sentence to 7 months’ imprisonment.

##### Step 3 - Calibration on account of mitigating and aggravating factors

301    Under the third step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ framework, I had taken into account the mitigation factors raised by the Accused in his Mitigation Plea. I also took into account the fact that the Accused was a first offender. However, I noted that there was no remorse on the part of the Accused in that he had decided to challenge the charge and we had to undergo 9 days of hearing for this matter. As the Accused had not pleaded guilty to the charge, the usual sentencing discount that was usually granted to a case whereby an offender had pleaded guilty would not be applicable to the Accused.

#### The appropriate sentence in the present case

302    In applying the _Ng Soon Kim_ framework, the appropriate sentence would be at least 7 months’ imprisonment. This was also in line with the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution.

303    Having considered all the above factors, I imposed a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment on the Accused, the sentence to take effect from the date of my sentence.

304    The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against my order on conviction and sentence. I had also granted a stay of execution of the sentence pending appeal and the Accused had also been granted bail pending appeal.
