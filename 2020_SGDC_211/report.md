Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases

9 September 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Lim Wen Juin:

1       This is an assessment of damages in a motor accident case. The plaintiff sustained personal injuries in a collision on 25 November 2015 between the car driven by the first defendant in which he was a passenger and a car driven by the second defendant. Pursuant to a consent interlocutory judgment dated 16 May 2018 the defendants are to pay all of the damages assessed to be due to the plaintiff with the first defendant bearing 15% and the second defendant 85%.

## The plaintiff’s injuries and history of medical consultations

2       The plaintiff’s case is that the accident caused him four injuries, namely:

> (a)     neck injury consisting of acute deceleration soft tissue injury to the cervical spine;

> (b)     right wrist injury with tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (“TFCC”) and extensor carpi ulnaris (“ECU”) tendinopathy;

> (c)     left tennis elbow; and

> (d)     lower back injury with L5-S1 posterior annular tear and central extruded disc prolapse.

3       The defendants accept that the neck and right wrist injuries were caused by the accident but they contend that the left tennis elbow and the lower back injury were not. In this regard they argue that the plaintiff did not complain about any pain in his left elbow or back for weeks after the accident.

4       Given this argument of the defendants I think it would be useful and convenient to set out at this juncture a summary of the various consultations that the plaintiff had with medical doctors as appear from the evidence before me.

> (a)     On 25 November 2015, the day of the accident, the plaintiff went to the emergency department at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (“NTFGH”). It was recorded that he complained of pain in his neck and right wrist: see the reports of Dr Liew Kok Wei dated 16 December 2015 and Dr Chen Yongsheng dated 30 May 2016 (“Dr Chen’s Report”).

> (b)     On 3 December 2015, the plaintiff went to the orthopaedic clinic at NTFGH. It was recorded that he “had no more neck pain” but was “found to have tenderness over the fovea of the right wrist”, and a diagnosis of “possible TFCC injury” was made: see Dr Chen’s Report.

> (c)     On 17 December 2015, about three weeks after the accident, the plaintiff returned to the NTFGH emergency department. It was recorded that he complained of “neck pain, left elbow pain and right wrist pain”: see Dr Chen’s Report. This was the first recorded complaint of elbow pain.

> (d)     On 14 January 2016, about seven weeks after the accident, the plaintiff returned to the NTFGH orthopaedic clinic. It was recorded that he complained of “left elbow pain, neck pain, low back pain and persistent right wrist pain”. A diagnosis of “left tennis elbow” was made. Although “his neck pain had improved”, he had “persistent tenderness over the fovea of the right wrist” that resulted in the doctors ordering magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) of the right wrist: see Dr Chen’s Report. This was the first recorded complaint of back pain.

> (e)     On 10 March 2016, the plaintiff returned to NTFGH for a review of the MRI of the right wrist and he was referred to the hand surgery clinic at the same hospital: see Dr Chen’s Report.

> (f)     On 15 March 2016, the plaintiff went to the hand surgery clinic at NTFGH. It was recorded that “treatment options for his wrist injury were discussed”: see Dr Chen’s Report.

> (g)     On 7 April 2016, the plaintiff returned to the orthopaedic clinic at NTFGH. It was recorded that he complained of “low back pain radiating to the left buttock and left posterior thigh, with positive cough impulse”, and that MRI of his lumbar spine was carried out and this showed “multilevel degenerative disc disease with canal stenosis at L5/S1” with a “disc prolapse” at that same level: see Dr Chen’s Report.

> (h)     On 5 May 2016, the plaintiff returned to NTFGH. It was recorded that he complained of “persistent lower back pain with burning pain radiating down the left thigh”: see Dr Chen’s Report.

> (i)     On 12 July 2016, the plaintiff saw Dr Andre Cheah at the hand surgery clinic at NTFGH. Dr Cheah was one of the two doctors who attended court to give evidence in this assessment of damages.

> (j)     On 2 December 2016, about a year after the accident, the plaintiff saw Dr W C Chang – Dr Chang was the other doctor who attended court to give evidence. It was recorded that the plaintiff complained of intermittent pain and weakness in his right wrist as well as intermittent low back pain that “can radiate down the back of his left thigh”, but he did not have “any neck pain or left elbow pain”: see the report of Dr Chang dated 7 January 2017.

> (k)     On 14 September 2017, the plaintiff returned to see Dr Cheah. It was recorded that the plaintiff had “residual mild pain over the right wrist with reduced grip strength and range of motion”, and Dr Cheah opined that the “disabilities are likely to be permanent”: see the report of Dr Cheah dated 13 November 2017.

> (l)     On 28 February 2018, the plaintiff returned to see Dr Chang. It was recorded that the plaintiff complained of weakness and intermittent pain in the right wrist as well as stiffness and intermittent pain in his lower back, “especially on the left side”, and that the “pain from the neck injury and left ‘tennis elbow’ remained settled”: see the report of Dr Chang dated 22 March 2018.

> (m)     On 3 September 2019, after the plaintiff had attended court to give evidence in this assessment of damages on 21 June 2019, he returned to see Dr Chang. By this time almost four years had gone by since the accident. It was recorded that the plaintiff complained of “essentially the same symptoms” as he had done at the most recent visit to Dr Chang on 28 February 2018: see the report of Dr Chang dated 19 November 2019.

## General damages for pain and suffering

### Neck injury

5       For the soft tissue injury to the neck the plaintiff submits that $7,000 should be awarded as general damages for pain and suffering on the basis of Dr Chang’s opinion that if he were to use the Quebec classification for whiplash-associated disorders he would put the plaintiff’s injury at Grade 2. The plaintiff cites the range of $7,000 to $8,000 recommended in the _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“_Guidelines_”) for the category of “Minor whiplash injury and soft tissue damage classified as Grade 2 whiplash injury”. But the defendants say that the award should instead fall within the range of $1,500 to $3,000 recommended in the _Guidelines_ for the category of “Neck sprain not amounting to Grade 1 whiplash injury in which the pain resolves in a few days with no residual disabilities”. They submit that an award of $2,000 would be appropriate. The defendants rely on the fact that in the earliest medical reports the plaintiff’s neck injury was said variously to be a “neck sprain” (see the report of Dr Liew dated 16 December 2015) or a “\[n\]eck contusion” (see Dr Chen’s Report). In turn the plaintiff points out that Dr Chang opined in court that the plaintiff’s injury was at a “more serious level than a simple neck strain” because there was a “sudden deceleration force to the neck” (see the Notes of Evidence for 25 November 2017 at p 7C–D).

6       I do not think that it is necessary for me to express any firm view as to whether the plaintiff’s injury is most properly called a neck sprain, or a neck contusion, or an acute deceleration soft tissue injury, or grade 2 whiplash. This is because in my view the diagnostic label given to the plaintiff’s neck injury is not determinative of the amount of general damages that should be awarded. The purpose of general damages is to compensate the plaintiff for the pain and suffering he had to endure, hence it seems to me that the extent of that pain and suffering is what is truly material. In this connection, as the defendants observe, the plaintiff was recorded to have “no more neck pain” when he went to the orthopaedic clinic at NTFGH about a week after the accident on 3 December 2015, but the neck pain re-emerged at his visit to NTFGH two weeks later on 17 December 2015 and persisted until his next medical consultation four weeks later on 14 January 2016, albeit with noticeable improvement. Although the defendants say that the disappearance and reappearance of the neck pain was “highly suspect”, given the fairly close proximity in time between the consultations of 3 and 17 December 2015, and in the absence of any suggestion that there was some intervening event between those consultations that could have caused such significant injury to the plaintiff’s neck that the pain continued for at least a month after that, I think it inherently less probable that there was such an intervening event than that the neck pain was throughout a consequence of the accident and waxed and waned over time.

7       Accordingly I find that the accident caused the plaintiff substantial initial pain to his neck that went away within a week but returned two weeks later and gradually decreased in intensity over the next four weeks. Given that the neck pain had “improved” by 14 January 2016 and that there was no recorded complaint of neck pain at any subsequent medical consultation, I infer that the pain and suffering from the neck injury had substantially ceased within two or three months of the accident. In the _Guidelines_, the ranges suggested for neck sprains and the category immediately above it of “Minor whiplash injury and soft tissue damage classified as Grade 1 whiplash injury” are discontinuous: for the former the range is $1,500 to $3,000 but there is then a jump to the range of $5,000 to $7,000 for the latter. Although the sums between $3,000 and $5,000 are thereby unaccounted for in the _Guidelines_ I see no reason in principle why the award cannot fall within that band. Given that $1,500 to $3,000 is thought appropriate where the pain from the neck injury resolves “in a few days”, and $5,000 to $7,000 is considered suitable where “neck pain, tenderness and stiffness” take “between a few weeks and two years” to resolve completely, it appears to me that a sum between $3,000 and $5,000 may be apt in a case where neck pain, tenderness and stiffness lasts for less than a few weeks, or where, as in this case, the symptoms appear to be confined to neck pain with no recorded disabilities such as restriction of neck motion, and the pain resolves completely within a few months. Given that the plaintiff’s neck pain was intermittent and not constant in nature I assess general damages for this injury at $4,000.

### Right wrist injury

8       For the right wrist injury the sums submitted by the plaintiff and the defendants are $35,000 and $6,000 respectively. On the basis of Dr Chang’s and Dr Cheah’s evidence I accept that the injury has had lasting effects in that almost four years after the accident the plaintiff continued to have weakness in the grip of his right hand and stiffness and intermittent pain in his right wrist – “stiffness” referring to restriction in the range of movements of the wrist, and “intermittent” pain meaning, as Dr Chang explained, pain whenever the plaintiff needed to exert substantial force with his right hand, for instance when lifting a weight of more than five kilograms or when “gripping objects firmly” (see the Notes of Evidence for 25 November 2017 at pp 24E to 25C) . I accept also that these effects are likely to be permanent and that the plaintiff is further “predisposed to post-traumatic arthritis (osteoarthritis)” of his distal radioulnar joint.

9       But I consider that the plaintiff’s submission is much too high given that in the _Guidelines_ the range recommended for the category of “Severe and/or compound fractures of the distal radius and ulna in which extensive surgery is required” is $25,000 to $32,000 and I do not think that the plaintiff’s injuries reach that level of severity. The plaintiff relies on the precedent of _Jee Jia Gian v Low Han Chin_ (DC Suit No 2603 of 1997), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (LexisNexis, 3rd ed, 2017) at p 476, in which a sum of $22,000 was agreed, but I think the defendants are correct to contend that this reliance is misplaced because that precedent concerned a more serious injury in the form of a “fracture dislocation” of the wrist that required surgery whereas in this case the plaintiff sustained ligament injury but no damage to the bone and he has not needed to undergo surgery.

10     Strictly speaking for wrist injuries the _Guidelines_ make provision for fractures only and not for ligament injuries including tears, but I consider that I can take reference from the _Guidelines_ nonetheless by comparing the effects of the plaintiff’s wrist injury with the effects of wrist fractures contemplated in the _Guidelines_. A range of $15,000 to $25,000 is recommended in the _Guidelines_ where a wrist fracture leads to “significant permanent disability and considerable pain on a long-term basis that cannot be resolved despite treatment”. I do not think the effects of the plaintiff’s injury are as serious as that. In particular, I do not think the plaintiff’s wrist pain can be described as “considerable” – when he saw Dr Cheah on 14 September 2017 it was “mild”, and as Dr Chang said the pain is “intermittent” rather than ever-present, and from the fact that the plaintiff has not gone for wrist surgery until now I infer that the pain does not interfere substantially with his ability to lead a normal life. Hence I do not think it would be appropriate to award general damages within that range, and instead I put this case in the range of $6,000 to $15,000 recommended for the category of “Moderate fractures of the distal radius and/or ulna” that give rise to “less severe” effects. Given the permanent nature of the impairment to the wrist and the risk of developing osteoarthritis I think an award in the upper regions of the range is warranted. Having agreed with the defendants’ primary submission that the plaintiff’s decision not to undergo surgery indicates that his wrist pain is not at all debilitating, I can reject their alternative submission that by omitting to undergo surgery to reduce his pain and suffering he has failed to mitigate his loss, the reason being that I accept it is not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have taken that step by now. I assess general damages for the right wrist injury at $13,000.

### Left tennis elbow

11     The defendants’ primary position is that the accident did not cause any left elbow injury in the plaintiff given that his first recorded complaint of elbow pain was made no less than three weeks after the accident. To this the plaintiff testified in court that he had been experiencing elbow pain even before his first recorded complaint but he did not report it earlier because it had been a “constant mild pain” and he had been “concentrating” on the “unbearable” pain in his wrist, and it was only later that the pain in his elbow became more pronounced (see the Notes of Evidence for 21 June 2019 at pp 8E and 27B). I find that this explanation for his belated complaint of elbow pain is consistent with the one he is recorded to have given to Dr Chang in Dr Chang’s report dated 22 March 2018, and this consistency is a reason to think that the plaintiff’s explanation is true. I am satisfied on the basis of Dr Chang’s expert evidence that tennis elbow can develop from the “sudden acute trauma” of a “one-time incident” (see the Notes of Evidence for 25 November 2019 at pp 14C and 26B). According to Dr Chang the plaintiff told him that the forward jolt from the accident caused “both hands” to be “jarred against the back of the left front seat” (see Dr Chang’s report dated 22 March 2018). I see no reason to doubt that this is what in fact happened to the plaintiff, and on this premise I accept Dr Chang’s opinion that it is possible that the “sudden hyperextension of the wrist stretched and tore the muscles around the elbow to cause lateral epicondylitis” (see the Notes of Evidence for 25 November 2019 at p 14D). I understand from Dr Chang that “lateral epicondylitis” is the technical term for tennis elbow.

12     Given that tennis elbow is a kind of injury that could result from the accident the plaintiff was involved in, and given also that it seems too coincidental to be very probable that in the relatively brief span of three weeks between the accident and the plaintiff’s first recorded complaint of elbow pain there could have occurred some separate trauma that gave rise to an elbow injury, I am inclined to believe that the plaintiff’s left tennis elbow was caused by the accident and that the reason he did not complain earlier about elbow pain was that he had been too preoccupied by the more significant pain in his wrist. There is no dispute between parties that the plaintiff’s elbow injury is one of “minor severity” for which the _Guidelines_ recommend an award of up to $8,000. The plaintiff submits that the highest sum of $8,000 would be right but the defendants say that $2,000 is sufficient. On the plaintiff’s own evidence the pain was “mild” for the first few weeks after the accident, and I infer from the fact that there was no recorded complaint of elbow pain after the medical consultation on 14 January 2016 that this pain, like the neck pain, substantially ceased within two or three months of the accident. Hence I do not think the plaintiff’s elbow injury was particularly severe such as would warrant an award at the upper limit of the range. Having thought $4,000 appropriate for the plaintiff’s neck injury with effects of similar duration but with greater initial pain, and bearing in mind that the neck is a more sensitive and vulnerable part of the body than the elbow, I think that the defendant’s submission is reasonable and so I assess general damages for the elbow injury at $2,000.

### Lower back injury

13     As with the elbow injury the defendants’ primary position is that the accident did not cause any lower back injury in the plaintiff. His first recorded complaint of back pain was made on 14 January 2016, no less than seven weeks after the accident. To this the plaintiff testified in court that he had in fact complained of low back pain before 14 January 2016 (see the Notes of Evidence for 21 June 2019 at p 27C). My overall impression of the plaintiff was that he was truthful to the best of his ability in giving evidence in court, but there remains the possibility that he could have been honestly mistaken in his recollection of when he first complained of back pain to the doctors. Given that the medical reports, especially Dr Chen’s Report, appear to record in a diligent and comprehensive manner the plaintiff’s complaints at each medical consultation, I am inclined to treat the medical reports as an exhaustive record of his complaints. Hence I think it more likely that the plaintiff did not complain of back pain until 14 January 2016 than that he did so prior to that. The fact that the plaintiff did not complain of back pain for at least seven weeks after the accident does not by itself mean that the accident caused the plaintiff no back injury. But it does in my view lead to the inference that the plaintiff experienced little or no back pain for seven weeks after the accident. That in turn will have a bearing on my assessment of the severity of any back injury that might have been caused by the accident.

14     It is not disputed that the plaintiff had “degenerative lumbar spondylosis” that was “pre-existing”, meaning that this degenerative condition existed even before the accident occurred. Before the accident the plaintiff had had “an episode of low back pain in March 2015 after straining it playing soccer”. It is also not disputed that the MRI done after the accident showed a “posterior annular tear” at the disc at the L5-S1 level of the spine “with a sizeable central extruded disc prolapse compressing the thecal sac” (see the report of Dr Chang dated 7 January 2017). No pre-accident MRI was available for comparison. Dr Chang explained in court that a disc comprises the wall, called the annulus, and the “gel in the middle”, and where there is an annular tear the wall is breached with the consequence that the “contents come out” – which I understand to mean that gel escapes through the breach in the wall – and this coming out of the contents is known as a “prolapse” or “extrusion”. In some cases the dislodged disc can compress a nerve and cause “pain going down the legs” (see the Notes of Evidence for 25 November 2019 at p 29D–E).

15     Dr Chang was unequivocally of the view that the annular tear and extruded disc prolapse “were most certainly a result of the accident” (see his report dated 7 January 2017). But the difficulty with this is that, as Dr Chang testified, when one suffers an annular tear one “\[u\]sually” feels the pain “immediately” (see the Notes of Evidence for 25 November 2019 at p 29C). Given the inference I have drawn that the plaintiff felt no perceptible pain for about seven weeks after the accident, I am unable to conclude on a balance of probabilities that the accident was the sole cause of the annular tear and disc prolapse observed from the MRI done after the accident. It is a possibility I cannot exclude that they were caused by a pre-accident event, for example the soccer-related incident that took place about eight months before the accident in which, as the plaintiff explained, he was felled by a “hard sliding tackle” (see the Notes of Evidence for 21 June 2019 at p 12A–C). Dr Chang opined that this soccer-related incident had nothing to do with the plaintiff’s persistent back symptoms and was “just a strain that resolved shortly after onset of pain”, but so far as his reason for saying so was that there had been “no need to do MRI or X-ray at the time, so it was a mild thing” (see the Notes of Evidence for 25 November 2019 at p 21D–E), this seems to me only partially accurate as a matter of fact given that there was an X-ray done on 24 March 2015. Hence I do not attach substantial weight to Dr Chang’s evidence on this point.

16     Even if the accident cannot be said to be the only cause of the lower back pain and stiffness that the plaintiff continued to feel almost four years after the accident, there remains the possibility that the accident contributed to these effects. Dr Chang’s evidence, which I wholly accept, was that in a motor accident involving “deceleration injury to the spine” it is entirely possible that a lower back injury might result even if the injured person were wearing a seatbelt because the “whole spine is thrown forward” leading to a “hyper-flexion injury”. He testified that “in a lot of similar traffic accidents” the “most common injury will be the neck, followed by lower back”, with the thoracic spine (located between the neck and lower back) less likely to be affected because it is “well-protected by the rib cage” in that it is “one block with the rib cage” (see the Notes of Evidence for 25 November 2019 at p 27E to 28D). Given that the accident was forceful enough to cause the plaintiff to sustain other substantial injuries including a deceleration soft tissue injury to the neck, I consider it more likely than not that the accident contributed to the plaintiff’s persistent lower back pain and stiffness.

17     The plaintiff submits that a sum of $20,000 should be awarded for the lower back injury. That might be a reasonable amount if the accident had been the sole cause of the plaintiff’s lower back pain and stiffness but given that I am unable to make that finding I think that the plaintiff’s submission is excessive. I agree with the defendants’ characterisation of the plaintiff’s pre-existing degenerative lumbar spondylosis as not minor given that, as Dr Chang acknowledged, it was “multilevel” in nature, and so it seems to me a real possibility I cannot disregard that even if the accident had not occurred the plaintiff would at some point in the future experience discomfort or even pain by reason of his degenerative condition in combination with external events such as a hard impact while playing a sport. The award for the back injury should thus compensate the plaintiff not for the entirety of the lower back pain and stiffness he experienced and is experiencing but for the early appearance of those symptoms that might otherwise have afflicted him only later in life. I consider that the defendants’ submission of $6,000 is not far off the mark, but given the persistence of the pain and stiffness I assess general damages for the back injury at the slightly higher sum of $7,000.

## Loss of earning capacity

18     The principal difficulty in the way of the plaintiff’s claim for loss of earning capacity is that it is not clear how his present ability to work is impaired by the injuries caused by the accident. At the time of the accident the plaintiff was employed as a safety coordinator by JGC Construction International Pte Ltd. Even after the accident he continued in this role for about a year and a half and left when his contract of employment ended in April 2017. The income he earned in 2016, the year after the accident, was substantially higher than the income he earned in 2015, the year in which the accident occurred. From these facts I infer that in the year after the accident the plaintiff’s injuries did not hinder him in carrying out his duties at work. Since April 2017 the plaintiff has managed to secure multiple jobs on a contract basis, and at the time he gave evidence in court on 21 June 2019 he was employed and had been working in that job since May 2018, and was earning a slightly higher monthly income than he had been at the time of the accident. The inference is that up to the time the plaintiff gave evidence in court the injuries he sustained from the accident did not prevent him from working and earning income at his pre-accident capacity. Given that Dr Chang recorded “no significant changes of the medical condition” of the plaintiff between 28 February 2018 and 3 September 2019 (see his report dated 19 November 2019), it does not appear that the effects of his injuries are getting worse over time. That being so, there is little basis to think that the injuries caused by the accident are presently hampering his ability to work. Although the plaintiff is correct to say that the mere fact that his income has increased over the years is no categorical bar to a finding that he has suffered a loss in earning capacity, it remains his burden to prove such loss and the increase in income is on any reasonable view a fact that tends to show that the plaintiff is at least as equipped to earn income now as he was before the accident.

19     In his evidence the plaintiff has offered no more than general statements that he is “handicapped in the labour market because any employer would prefer to employ and retain healthy and able-bodied persons”, and that his residual disabilities “would affect \[his\] work performance and standing with \[his\] employers”. He does not explain specifically what work it is that he does, or would ordinarily expect to do given his academic qualifications and prior work experience, and how that is affected by the pain and stiffness in his right wrist and lower back. He submits that to establish a claim for loss of earning capacity all he needs to show is that, as between a person with physical disabilities such as he is and a person who is completely able-bodied, an employer would choose the latter over the former. But even disregarding the fact that this submission is phrased in terms that assumes its conclusion, I think that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that a prospective employer in his line of work would consider him to be noticeably less able to do the work for which he is qualified than a person who has not been injured. Therefore I am not satisfied that the accident has caused the plaintiff to suffer any loss of earning capacity and I do not award any damages for this head of claim.

## Medical and transport expenses

20     Parties agree that the plaintiff incurred medical expenses in the sum of $1,873.56 and so I assess damages for this item at that amount. As for transport expenses, parties agree that the plaintiff should be compensated for the expense incurred in making 20 round trips but they differ on how much he can recover for each round trip: the plaintiff submits $50 while the defendants submit $20. The plaintiff has not provided any receipts and in his evidence he does not explain why $50 is warranted per round trip – he does not, for instance, explain the origins and destinations of these round trips. Given that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof I am unable to make a finding that $50 a trip is reasonable and so I fall back on the defendants’ submission. Hence I assess damages for transport expenses at $400.

## Future medical expenses

21     In assessing damages for future medical expenses my understanding is that I should first ask whether there is an “_appreciable risk_” that the plaintiff will have to incur those expenses in the future, and then consider whether the amount of anticipated expenses recoverable as damages should be adjusted “to account for the remoteness of the possibility” that the expenses will be incurred and “the chance that factors unconnected with the defendant\[s’\] negligence might contribute to” the incurring of those expenses: see the Court of Appeal decision _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> at \[72\] (emphasis in original). The plaintiff submits that he should be awarded the full cost of the following medical procedures and treatments that he will have to undergo:

> (a)     arthroscopic debridement and TFCC repair in respect of his right wrist injury, which Dr Chang and Dr Cheah agreed would cost $11,000, followed by at least 20 sessions of physiotherapy that Dr Chang estimates would cost $80 at subsidised rates in a government clinic or hospital and $150 outside;

> (b)     excisional arthroplasty of the distal radioulnar joint or the Sauve-Kapandji procedure to correct osteoarthritis in his right wrist, at an estimated cost of $6,000; and

> (c)     spinal surgery in the form of L5-S1 discectomy and fusion of the L5-S1 segment, which Dr Chang estimates would cost $16,000, followed by at least 20 sessions of physiotherapy at approximately the same rates applicable to the right wrist injury.

22     Although the defendants submit that the plaintiff should not receive any award at all for future medical expenses, I find it difficult to escape the conclusion that there is an “appreciable risk” that the plaintiff will have to undergo arthroscopic debridement and TFCC repair as well as spinal surgery at some point in the future. This is because both Dr Chang and Dr Cheah have recommended that the plaintiff undergo the former procedure for his right wrist, and Dr Chang has recommended that he undergo the latter procedure to address the effects of his lower back injury. On the other hand, I do not think there is an appreciable risk that the plaintiff will have to undergo excisional arthroplasty of the distal radioulnar joint or the Sauve-Kapandji procedure. This is because according to Dr Chang that is required only in cases of “severe arthritis”. To begin with the plaintiff does not presently have osteoarthritis, merely a predisposition to developing it, and even if it develops the medical evidence supplies no reason to think that there is any real possibility that it will be of a severe degree. I need therefore say nothing more about that procedure.

23     So far as the defendants argue that the plaintiff is unlikely to opt for any surgery in the future given that he has until now declined to go for surgery of any sort, given the persistence of the pain and stiffness in his right wrist and lower back I consider that it remains an “appreciable risk” that he will need surgery eventually. But the defendants’ argument is a valid point to be reckoned with at the subsequent stage of the enquiry where I make adjustments in order to “account for the remoteness of the possibility” that the plaintiff will undergo surgery. Given that the plaintiff has been able to live with the effects of his injuries for more than four years after the accident, I think that there is a high probability that he will choose not to have surgery after all, and that this necessitates a very significant downward adjustment. In the absence of an alternative figure I accept that arthroscopic debridement and TFCC repair may reasonably be expected to cost $11,000, and I accept also that after such a procedure at least 20 sessions of physiotherapy would be needed. I think the reasonable cost of 20 sessions would be $1,600 at $80 per session because I see no reason why it would be inapt to expect the plaintiff to avail himself of the subsidised rates at government clinics or hospitals. From the starting point of $12,600 that this yields I think it broadly right to apply a 90% discount and so I assess damages for this item of future medical expenses at $1,260.

24     As for the spinal surgery, I think that an even heavier downward adjustment is required given that the plaintiff has pre-existing degenerative lumbar spondylosis which gives rise to the possibility that he might need spinal surgery in the future even if the accident had not occurred. In the absence of alternative figures I accept $16,000 and $1,600 as reasonable estimates of the cost of this surgery and 20 sessions of physiotherapy thereafter respectively. This gives a starting point of $17,600. Having assessed damages in respect of anticipated right wrist surgery at 10% of the estimated cost, applying a broad brush I assess damages in respect of anticipated spinal surgery at 2.5% of the estimated cost, which is $440. Hence damages for future medical expenses are assessed at an aggregate sum of $1,700.

## Concluding summary

25     The total amount of damages assessed to be due to the plaintiff is $29,973.56, broken down in the following way:

> (a)     $26,000 as general damages for pain and suffering, comprising the following components –

>> (i)       $4,000 for the soft tissue injury to the cervical spine,

>> (ii)       $13,000 for the right wrist injury,

>> (iii)       $2,000 for the left tennis elbow, and

>> (iv)       $7,000 for the lower back injury;

> (b)     $1,873.56 for incurred medical expenses;

> (c)     $400 for incurred transport expenses; and

> (d)     $1,700 for future medical expenses.

26     I am most grateful to counsel for all parties for their invaluable assistance throughout this assessment of damages.
