Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Totality Principle

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9098/2020/01.\]

28 April 2020

### District Judge John Ng:

1       This is an appeal by the Prosecution against the total sentence of 45 months’ imprisonment. The DPP sought a total sentence of 60 months or 5 years’ imprisonment. The accused is Cheng Jun (male/33)(“the Accused”) and he pleaded guilty to fourteen (14) charges of Unauthorised Access to Computer Material under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act[^1], Chapter 50A, 2007 Rev Ed (“the Act”). Twenty-two (22) other charges under the same provision were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for sentencing. Section 3(1) of the Act provides as follows:

> “Subject to subsection (2), any person who knowingly causes a computer to perform any function for the purpose of securing access without authority to any program or data held in any computer shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.”

As the Accused did not have any criminal record, he is liable to the maximum punishment of a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

2       The Accused had pleaded guilty on 30 March 2020 and was sentenced to a total of 45 months’ imprisonment on the same day. The sentence was backdated to take effect from **1 March 2019** as the Accused had been in remand since that date. The Prosecution lodged this appeal on 2 April 2020 against the sentence. The Accused is currently serving the sentence.

3       The Prosecution proceeded with 14 charges and applied to have the remaining 22 charges taken into consideration when passing sentence. The charges were framed in one of two ways for each of the 3 bank accounts of the company from which monies were transferred out to the Accused’s personal bank account – by a specific date or by an amalgamation of dates within a specific month. Each of the charges was framed generally in the same manner with different dates and amounts involved and it suffices for our purposes to reproduce the two manners of framing the charges here:

> _DAC 907016/2019 (amalgamated form)_,

> “You are charged that you, on not less than 8 occasions in December 2015, in Singapore, did embark on a course of conduct, namely, knowingly causing the United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) Internet Banking Service to perform a function for the purpose of securing access without authority to the UOB computer banking system holding information with respect to UOB account XXX belonging to Sinopay Singapore Private Limited (the “Sinopay account”), _to wit_, by logging into the UOB Internet banking Service using one Christopher Chuang’s login credentials and accessing the Sinopay Account in order to cause a transfer of a total of S$72,471.34/- to your personal bank account, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, Chapter 50A, which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68.”

> _DAC 907042/2019 (by specific date)_,

> “You are charged that you, on 3 March 2017, in Singapore, did knowingly cause the United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) Internet Banking Service to perform a function for the purpose of securing access without authority to the UOB computer banking system holding information with respect to UOB account XXX belonging to Sinopay Singapore Private Limited (the “Sinopay account”), _to wit_, by logging into the UOB Internet banking Service using one Christopher Chuang’s login credentials and accessing the Sinopay Account in order to cause a transfer of a total of S$20,000.00/- to your personal bank account, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, Chapter 50A.”

## The Brief Facts

4       The Accused was the Financial Manager of Sinopay (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the company”). He was tasked to manage the company’s business accounting and human resources, including billing accounts, payments to customers and employees’ salaries. The company is a subsidiary of the Sinopay Group which provides professional bankcard and financial services.

5       The Accused reports to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the company. The CEO had control of iBanking services over three bank accounts of the company with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”). The CEO resides in Hong Kong and the Accused was tasked to receive in Singapore the UOB iBanking tokens assigned to the CEO for the three current accounts and dispatch them together with the UOB internet account information via courier to him in Hong Kong. However, the Accused only sent the UOB confirmation letters to the CEO without the accompanying iBanking tokens.

6       The Accused committed the offences by carrying out the following:

> (a)     He received the initial passwords to all three UOB Current accounts of the company.

> (b)     Being aware of the username of the CEO to the accounts, he logged-in to the UOB iBanking accounts using the CEO’s iBanking credentials to activate the assigned iBanking tokens and changed the passwords without the CEO’s knowledge.

> (c)     Using the iBanking tokens in his possession, he would log-in to UOB’s iBanking service using the CEO’s credentials to transfer funds from the company’s accounts to his own bank accounts.

7       The Accused was not authorised by the CEO to perform the bank transfers to his own bank accounts. The Accused admitted that he had spent the monies on his personal expenses and on gambling at casinos. Between January 2015 and March 2017, the Accused transferred a total of $1,293,496.17 to himself from the company’s UOB accounts.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

8       The Prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence for the offences is to run 5 sentences of imprisonment terms consecutively for a total of 5 years’ imprisonment (Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence (“PSS”) at \[3\]). The DPP put forth, _inter alia_, the following:

> ·    The Prosecution proposed that a sentencing framework based on the harm-culpability matrix approach be adopted for all offences under Section 3(1) of the Act (at \[2\] of PSS). The approach is similar to that of the High Court in the case of _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> (“_Logachev_”) for “cheating at play” offences under the Casino Control Act, Chapter 33A.

> ·    The dominant sentencing principle is one of Deterrence – both General and Specific Deterrence (at \[4\] of PSS).

> ·    General deterrence was applicable as this was a case of cyber-crime (at \[5\] of PSS).

> ·    Specific deterrence was applicable as there was premeditation and commission of multiple offences over a period of time (at \[6\] of PSS).

9       Using the 5-step sentencing framework, the DPP arrived at a total of 5 years’ imprisonment. The DPP submitted that this case involved High Culpability. As for the Harm caused, the DPP submitted that it depended on the amounts involved. The DPP proposed that amounts involving less than $90,000 should fall into the moderate harm category and amounts involving $90,000 and more should fall into the severe harm category.

10     Based on the proposed Harm-Culpability Matrix suggested by the Prosecution, under High Culpability, the DPP submitted 18 months’ imprisonment for the charges involving severe harm and 12 months’ imprisonment for charges involving moderate harm. After adjusting for the offender-specific factors (guilty plea, cooperation, partial recovery of monies and TIC charges), the DPP submitted 12 months’ imprisonment per charge for severe harm and 9 months’ imprisonment per charge for moderate harm.

## Mitigation by Defence Counsel

11     The Defence Counsel submitted, _inter alia_, the following mitigating factors:

> ·    The Accused is genuinely very remorseful. He had cooperated fully with the authorities and had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.

> ·    There was partial recovery of the monies and the car purchased with the proceeds of crime.

> ·    The Accused is a first offender and has no criminal record.

> ·    The Accused is a divorcee and has a 6-year-old daughter. He was the family’s sole breadwinner and supporting his parents before going into remand.

12     The Defence submitted that a total sentence of 40 months’ imprisonment would be fair and just. Counsel submitted that 40 months’ imprisonment would be sufficient to serve both general and specific deterrence and it would not offend the Totality Principle.

13     The Defence submitted that the global sentence of 5 years sought by the Prosecution offends the first limb of the Totality Principle, as it is substantially above the normal sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. It is also way above the maximum punishment of 2 years’ imprisonment for an offence under Section 3(1) of the Act.

## Sentencing Considerations

14     Both the Prosecution and the Defence share the common view that the dominant sentencing principle in this case is Deterrence. There is no doubt that that is the principal sentencing consideration for this case. After taking into account the facts of this case, the submissions of both the Prosecution and the Defence and the relevant sentencing factors, the Accused was sentenced to 45 months of imprisonment in total.

15     The Prosecution had adopted the 5-step sentencing approach used in the _Logachev_ case. It is a comprehensive approach and is helpful for the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the present case. I had similarly used it to calibrate the sentences but with a caveat of some concerns on the harm-culpability matrix proposed by the DPP for **_all_** offences under Section 3(1) of the Act.

#### Concerns about the Prosecution’s proposed Harm-Culpability Matrix

16     Although the 5-step approach can be adopted as a sentencing aid, there are a few obvious concerns about the proposed sentencing matrix of the Prosecution (at \[22\] of the PSS). Before we look at these concerns, it is to be noted that the effort and attempt by the DPP in coming up with a sentencing matrix is appreciated by the Court.

17     It is clear that Section 3(1) of the Act covers a multitude of different types of unauthorized access to computer material in a myriad of circumstances. Even the survey of cases submitted by the Prosecution as case precedents covered four different types of unauthorized access (refer to PSS Annex A wherein is exhibited Tables A to D. Tables E to F are repeats of A to D.)

18     There are many different reasons and purposes for offenders to access computer materials, ranging from simply trying to find out something with no heinous intentions, to gaining access with nefarious purposes. An unauthorized access could be a preparation for a very serious attack on the integrity of the computer system or database such as hacking to bring down public services. It would be too broad-brush to cover all of these variants with one overarching sentencing Harm-Culpability Matrix as set out by the Prosecution in this case.

19     It would also be over-reaching to propose a _common or fixed range_ of sentences for the different scenarios covered by a very broad offence provision such as Section 3(1) of the Act. It is axiomatic that any indicative sentencing range ought to be determined with reference to the principal factual elements of each case. The myriad of different principal factual elements for the different types of offences under Section 3(1) of the Act makes it untenable to have one common Harm-Culpability Matrix for all.

20     Another concern touches on the weightage to be assigned to the harm-culpability dichotomy and their principal elements. Depending on the types of offences under Section 3(1) of the Act, it may not be right to attribute equal weight to the different principal elements for each type of offences. For example, an access into sensitive computer material might demand a stiff custodial sentence even though there was no property loss or tangible harm caused. Furthermore, there is the lack of a proper basis to say why “medium culpability-moderate harm” should be in the range of 3-9 months or why “low culpability-severe harm” should be in the range of 3-9 months.

21     More pertinent to the case at hand – a crime involving stealing of monies from the bank accounts of an employer with misappropriated iBanking tokens – how would one determine how much dollar value is to come within the range of low, moderate or severe harm? Is $100,000 low, moderate or severe harm? Does it depend on the wealth of the employer or the size of the corporate employer?

## Calibration of the Sentences

22     Even though there are concerns to be mindful of in attempting to prescribe an overarching Harm-Culpability Matrix for sentencing offences under Section 3(1) of the Act, as far as this case is concerned, my calibration of the individual sentences is not far off from that suggested by the DPP. That was because the factors relevant to the calibration of each of the sentences for the offences in the 14 charges were obvious and had been fully articulated in the PSS. The calibration had taken into account the need to utilize the full spectrum of the punishment provided for the offences in question.

23     Therefore, after taking into account all the relevant factors, including 22 other charges to be taken into consideration, the following sentences were passed:

24     In passing the sentences as shown in the table, I had considered the following:

> ·    The sentences for the individual charges varied according to the amount of money for each charge. This is because the method of obtaining the sums of money was the same for each charge _i.e_. using the misappropriated iBanking tokens to transfer money dishonestly from the corporate accounts to his bank accounts.

> ·    Based on the sentencing precedents for cases involving unauthorized fund transfers, the general ranges of imprisonment were in the region of 2 to 3 months for individual values of up to $5,000, 6 to 12 months for overall values of between $50,000 to $100,000 and more than 12 months for values exceeding $100,000. Admittedly, this is a rough and ready gauge based only on the monetary value of the amounts stolen and is only a starting point.

> ·    Next, an uplift was worked into the individual sentence to account for the TIC charges, the length of time that the criminal acts were repeated _i.e._ over 3 calendar years (the actual time-span was over 2 years and 2 months from January 2015 to March 2017) and the level of trust reposed in the Accused as the Financial Manager of the company.

> ·    On the other hand, a discount on the individual sentence was given for the mitigating factors of an early plea of guilt, cooperation with the authorities and partial recovery of the criminal proceeds. The Accused did not have any criminal record.

25     The major difference of the Court’s total sentence with the proposed total sentence by the Prosecution is in the running of the number of consecutive sentences. The key determinant of this difference is in the application of the first limb of the Totality Principle by the Court (and which was also highlighted by the Defence Counsel).

26     The Totality Principle was referred to in the _Logachev_ case, by the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, as follows (at \[84\]):

> “As to the content of the totality principle, this comprises two limbs. The first examines whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed, while the second considers whether the effect of the aggregate sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects (see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”) at \[54\] and \[57\] respectively). It has been said that the totality principle is one of limitation and is a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions (see _Shouffee_ at \[47\]).”

27     The Prosecution submitted that there ought to be a departure from the Totality Principle in this case. He recognized the infringement of the first limb of the Totality Principle in seeking a sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and cited the factors in \[32\] of the PSS (erroneously referred to by DPP as \[33\] of the PSS) in support but without showing any legally-recognized basis or case authority for ignoring the first limb of the Totality Principle.

28     I can find no legal or rational basis to disregard the first limb of the Totality Principle and therefore ordered four sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively (resulting in 45 months’ imprisonment in total) instead of five to run consecutively as submitted by the DPP. The 5 years’ imprisonment asked for by the Prosecution would be two and a half times longer than the maximum sentence for this offence. In my view, that would be manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case.

29     I would conclude with a hypothetical illustration to show that a sentence cannot go so far beyond the limitation of the maximum sentence provided for the offence if a mockery is not made of the first limb of the Totality Principle. If, for example in the case before me, the Accused had transferred one million dollars from the company account to his bank account using the same _modus operandi_ on a single occasion, and he was charged under Section 3(1) of the Act, he could only be punished with up to 2 years’ imprisonment and not a day longer.

30     If the first limb of the Totality Principle in Sentencing were departed from in this case, how would one, fairly and justifiably, determine whether two, five or ten of the 14 sentences ought to run consecutively? This case is not about whether to adopt any overarching framework. The crux of the matter is the application of the first limb of the Totality Principle to the determination of the overall sentence in the circumstances of this case.
