\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9079/2019/01.\]

26 September 2019

### District Judge Kenneth Yap:

The accused pleaded guilty at the commencement of her trial on 16 April 2018 to 27 charges of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code read with s 109. The sentencing process was adjourned for her to be sent for assessment by the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”). The psychiatric and psychological reports from IMH were provided to the defence on 22 November and 4 December 2018 respectively, after which the prosecution and defence took some time to assess the testing methodology in the report and determine whether a Newton Hearing was necessary to challenge its conclusion. In the end, the defence did not challenge the contents of the reports, and sentencing proceeded on 15 April 2019. The accused was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment. She has filed an appeal against sentence, but has declined to apply for a stay, preferring to commence her sentence on 22 April 2019.

### The Charges

2       The accused pleaded guilty to 26 charges of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy to cheat under s 417 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (“the abetment of cheating by conspiracy charges”). She also pleaded guilty to one charge of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy to cheat in relation to an offence which was not committed, pursuant to s 417 read with s 116 of the Penal Code (“the inchoate charge”).

3       The offence for abetment by conspiracy to cheat (where the offence _is_ committed) carries a maximum penalty of three years’ imprisonment and/or a fine. The offence for the inchoate charge carries a lower maximum term of imprisonment of nine months (i.e. one-fourth of the maximum term of imprisonment), and/or a fine.

4       Having heard the parties, I sentenced the accused to nine months’ imprisonment for each of the abetment by conspiracy charges (read with s 109 of the Penal Code), with the terms of imprisonment of four charges to run consecutively, for a total of 36 months’ imprisonment. For the remaining inchoate charge, the accused was sentenced to nine weeks’ imprisonment, the term of which was to run concurrently with her other sentences.

### Statement of Facts

#### Background

5       The charges in this case arose from a sophisticated operation in which members of the Zeus Education Centre (“Zeus”) assisted six PRC national students, aged from 17 to 20 years, to cheat in the their 2016 GCE ‘O’ Level examinations held from 19-24 October 2016.

6       The accused is a Singaporean female, aged 32 years. At the material time, she was one of the tuition Teachers at Zeus Education Centre (“Zeus”). She had also provided lodging services for students at Zeus.

7       The accused’s accomplices were:

> (a)     Poh Yuan Nie (also known as “Pony Poh”), a 52-year-old Singaporean female who was, at the material time, the _de facto_ principal running Zeus.

> (b)     Poh Min, Fiona, a 30-year-old Singaporean female, who is the niece of Pony Poh, and who was at the material time one of the tuition teachers at Zeus.

> (c)     Feng Riwen, a 25-year-old PRC male national, who was helping out at Zeus and at times also conducting classes there.

8       Investigations revealed that the six students involved were referred by one Dong Xin, a 30 year-old PRC national, to Zeus, for the purpose of preparing them for the 2016 GCE “O” Level Examinations. It was contractually stipulated that for each of the students that Dong Xin had sent to Zeus, Pony Poh would receive deposit moneys amounting to about $8,000 and admissions fees amounting to about $1,000. The contracts also stipulated that the monies were fully refundable, if the students failed to pass the GCE ‘O’ level examinations and subsequently failed to get emplaced in a Polytechnic in Singapore.

#### The abetment of cheating by conspiracy charges

9       Pony Poh, together with the other three members of her team (the accused, Fiona Poh and Feng Riwen), had discussed and collectively agreed to help the six PRC students to cheat in various papers in the 2016 GCE ‘O’ Level examinations, by means of the following _modus operandi_:

> (a)     On the examination day, at Zeus, the accused, Fiona Poh and Feng Riwen (“the trio”), under the instructions of Pony Poh, had helped the students attach wearable bluetooth devices on their bodies, which were linked to mobile phones concealed under the students’ clothing. The trio had also helped to place a skin-coloured ‘in-ear’ earphone on all of the students. The students then attended the examinations at their respective examination centres armed with these communication devices.

> (b)     With the help of Fiona Poh, a camera phone (iPhone) was affixed to the accused’s chest area with scotch tape. The accused also wore extra clothing to hide the affixed hand-phone from plain view. Subsequently, the accused attended the same examinations as the six PRC students as a private candidate.

> (c)     Once the examinations had started, the accused would use Facetime, an iPhone application, to connect with Pony Poh, Fiona Poh and Feng Riwen, who were stationed at Zeus’ premises, and provide a live feed of the exam papers that she was attempting.

> (d)     Viewing the exam papers that were beamed live, Fiona Poh then attempted to answer the questions in these papers, with Feng Riwen’s assistance.

> (e)     Once the answers were ready, Pony Poh, and/or Fiona Poh, and/or Feng Riwen, and others unknown, would call the students individually and read out the answers to the said students. The students received the answers through the ‘in-ear’ earphones they were wearing via the mobile phones and bluetooth devices attached on them. The students consequently wrote the answers that were read out to them in their respective examination papers.

10     For the Mathematics Paper 2, scheduled on 21 October 2016 at 2:30pm, the roles between Fiona Poh and the accused were reversed. Fiona Poh was the one who had attended the examination with an iPhone strapped to her body, which was used to beam the question paper live to the accused. The accused, who was stationed at Zeus, then attempted the answers to the paper and transmitted the same to the students, with the help of Pony Poh, and/or Feng Riwen and or B1 and/or others unknown.

11     Investigations revealed that the above cheating operations ran uninterrupted from 19 October 2016 until 24 October 2016. In total, the accused and her accomplices assisted the six PRC students to cheat in 26 incidents over five examination sessions.

12     The accused had received remuneration by way of monthly salary of about $3,000 from Pony Poh. She also received $1,000 per student from Pony Poh for providing lodging to the PRC students.

13     Accordingly, the accused had abetted a conspiracy to commit 26 charges of cheating by engaging with Pony Poh, Fiona Poh and Feng Riwen, and others unknown along with one of six students enrolled in Zeus, in a conspiracy to cheat the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (“SEAB”), by deceiving SEAB into believing that the said student was taking the particular GCE ‘O’ Level examination, without assistance from any other person. Each of the students had dishonestly concealed such assistance in order to induce the SEAB to accept the said student’s answer script as legitimate submission for marking, an act SEAB would not have done were it not so deceived, as the act would likely have caused harm to SEAB’s reputation. In furtherance of this conspiracy, the said students did sit for the said examination at a particular examination centre, while receiving assistance from the aforementioned accomplices and the accused, in relation to each of the 26 abetment of cheating by conspiracy charges. All the papers attempted by the students had been sent by SEAB to Cambridge, United Kingdom for marking the very next day after each of the examinations.

#### The inchoate charge

14     The preceding offences came to light on 24 October 2016, during the GCE ‘O’ Level English Paper 1 examination, when one of the students, Chen Yi, was caught by an invigilator after she noticed him behaving suspiciously and heard unusual electronic transmission sounds emitting from his person.

15     Chen Yi was allowed to finish the English Paper 1. After the paper, he was escorted to the invigilators’ holding room, where he was asked to remove his vest. A mobile phone was found concealed in his vest, and upon questioning, Chen Yi revealed the devices affixed on his body, including the bluetooth devices and the ear piece. He also duly reported on what had transpired between him, Pony Poh, the accused and the other accomplices. Subsequently, SEAB was informed of Chen Yi’s cheating attempt.

16     In light of the foregoing, on or around 24 October 2016, in Singapore, the accused did abet an offence of cheating, by engaging with Chen Yi, Feng Riwen, Poh Min Fiona, Poh Yuan Nie @ Pony Poh and others unknown (“the conspirators”), in a conspiracy to cheat the SEAB, by deceiving SEAB into believing that Chen Yi was taking the GCE ‘O’ Level English Paper 1 without assistance from any other person, to wit, by dishonestly concealing the fact that Chen Yi would be receiving assistance from the aforementioned conspirators, in order to intentionally induce SEAB to accept Chen Yi’s answer script as a legitimate submission for marking, an act SEAB would not do were it not so deceived, which act was likely to cause harm to SEAB’s reputation, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that cheating, Chen Yi had sat for the GCE ‘O’ Level English Paper 1 on 24 October 2016 at 1:30 p.m. at 252 Tampines Street 12, Tampines Secondary School, Singapore, while receiving assistance from the aforementioned conspirators. As the scheme was thwarted, no offence of cheating was committed in consequence of the abetment, and the accused had thereby committed an offence under section 417 read with section 116 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).

### Antecedents

17     The accused is untraced.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

18     The prosecution sought a sentence of at least nine months’ imprisonment for each of the abetment of cheating by conspiracy charges (s 417 read with s 109), and at least 9-10 weeks’ imprisonment for the inchoate charge (s 417 read with s 116). It further submitted that four of the nine-month terms of imprisonment should run consecutively, for a global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment.

19     To justify the sentences, the prosecution relied on the presence of the following aggravating factors:

> (a)      **_Sophistication of offences and difficulty of detection:_** The present case involved a sophisticated operation with at least four persons working in concert. The offences also involved the unprecedented use of Bluetooth and Facetime technologies, which allowed the perpetrators to deliver answers to at least six different students in one sitting. In the words of the High Court in _PP v Fernando Payagola Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR 334</span> (“_Fernando Payagola_”), “a sophisticated offence replete with carefully orchestrated efforts and steps to avoid detection is an aggravating factor in sentencing” (at \[42\]).

> (b)      **_Premeditation and planning:_** The scheme in the present case involved carefully planned and executed steps, put into play by multiple conspirators working in concert.

> (c)      **_Difficulty of detection:_** Deliberate and careful steps were taken to avoid detection in this case, including by hiding the devices under the students’ clothes, and ensuring that the in-ear device was small and skin-coloured. The difficulty of detection was also evident from the fact that the cheating offences went uninterrupted for three examination days, with each of the six students having been assisted in multiple papers each. It was highly likely that such offences would have continued if not for the efforts of a vigilant invigilator.

> (d)      **_The integral role of the accused:_** The accused played a pivotal role in the scheme, not just by strapping the devices on the students, but by attending the examination herself to “live stream” the questions through Facetime so that answers could be provided to the students. She was critical to the scheme, and had full knowledge of the part she played in its initial success.

> (e)      **_Large number of offences:_** The accused faces 27 charges, 26 of which were successfully carried out over three days of examinations. It was submitted by the prosecution that as a matter of common sense and principle, the larger the number of offences, the longer should be the custodial sentence (per \[46\] of _Fernando Payagola_).

> (f)      **_The offences affected a public institution:_** The conspiracy seriously undermined the integrity of the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board, a statutory board under the Ministry of Education. The erosion of public trust in a public institution in its administration of an important national examination, in the view of the prosecution, merited a deterrent sentence (see _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[25(a)\]).

> (g)      **_The offences undermined integrity of examination system and harmed Singapore’s reputation as an education hub:_** The offences undermined the integrity of the O Level examinations, and more fundamentally, offended the principle of meritocracy which has long been considered an integral part of the principles underlying Singapore’s educational system. The prosecution submitted that a deterrent sentence was warranted due to the public disquiet caused (see _Law Aik Meng_ at \[24(c)\]), as well as harm caused to Singapore’s reputation as an education hub given the extensive media coverage both locally and internationally arising from these offences.

20     For the above reasons, the prosecution saw that there was a pressing need to send a strong signal to like-minded offenders, to stress that any attempt to undermine the national examination system in Singapore, especially those involving sophisticated planning and the use of technology, would be met with deterrent sentences.

### Mitigation Plea

21     In mitigation, counsel for the defence sought to explain that the accused was essentially manipulated into participation in the criminal conspiracy.

22     First, it was pointed out the accused had had a dysfunctional family background. She was raised by a nanny and was not close to her two older siblings. Her parents suffered a breakdown in their marriage, and when her brothers married and left the household, her isolation was exacerbated.

23     Second, the defence highlighted that the accused had a special and long-standing relationship with Pony Poh, which rendered her susceptible to the latter’s control. The accused first met Pony Poh when she was 16 years old. She had enrolled in and was taught by Pony at a tuition centre. Pony was then a 36 year-old female masquerading as a male. She showered the accused with attention, bringing her on paid excursions, buying her gifts, and supporting her financially. She became a mentor and confidante to the accused, and this eventually blossomed into a relationship, which carried on for seven years.

24     During this period, the defence paints a picture of the accused being caught in a web of deception and manipulation spun by Pony, rendering her trapped physically, emotionally and mentally. The accused worked at Pony’s tuition centre for free, dependent on the latter for allowances. Pony was controlling and possessive of the accused, resulting in the accused’s increasing isolation, and giving rise to thoughts of self-harm and suicide in the mind of the accused. The relationship ended when the accused found out that Pony was in another relationship.

25     According to the defence, the accused was nevertheless still under Pony’s control despite no longer being in a romantic relationship. She was still working for Pony at her tuition centre for a monthly salary. Pony also interfered in the accused’s subsequent relationships, eventually causing them to end. For example, when the accused wanted to re-locate to Shanghai with her then-fiancé, Pony prevailed on her to remain at the tuition centre, which led to the end of the accused’s relationship.

26     Third, the defence contended that the accused did not commit the offences for personal financial gain. It was alleged that Pony was the person who truly benefitted from the commission of the offences. Pony was alleged to have received $8,000 in deposit monies and $1,000 in admission fees for each student who was assisted in the examinations, whereas the accused did not receive any share of these payments. Rather, the accused received a monthly salary of $3,000, which she had already been receiving for some years. In short, there was no uplift for her participation in Pony’s criminal scheme. While the accused also received $1,000 from each PRC student housed in her family home, it was highlighted that these pertained to students other than the six PRC students involved in the cheating incidents. It was submitted that the accused’s motive was not for monetary reward, and that her motivations were therefore less blameworthy (per _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span>, at \[96\]).

27     Fourth, it was pointed out that the accused had shown remorse and that specific deterrence should therefore be given less weight. During investigations, the accused was forthcoming, and had assisted by agreeing to be a prosecution witness against the co-accused persons at trial. Finally, her decision to plead guilty had saved the resources of both prosecution and the courts.

28     Fifth, it was highlighted that the accused was untraced, and had a low risk of re-offending as she had cut ties with those involved in the offences. She had strong family support, would be able to turn her life around.

29     Given the above factors, the defence sought a sentence of not more than six months’ imprisonment for each of the abetment of cheating by conspiracy charges. In support of this argument, the defence referred to four precedents:

> (a)      _PP v Ler Teck Siang_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 278</span> (“_Ler Teck Siang_”). In this case, the accused (“_Ler_”) was a medical doctor who had submitted a false HIV blood test result in order to secure an employment pass for one Mikhy K Farrera-Brochez (Mikhy”), with whom he was in a relationship. He received **nine months’ imprisonment** for a single abetment of cheating charge under s 417 of the Penal Code. This sentence ran concurrently with three other sentences which ran consecutively (a further cheating charge under s 420 of the Penal Code, as well as two charges of giving false information to a public servant under s 182 of the Penal Code), for which the accused was given a global sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment. However, it was pointed out that Ler had claimed trial, and had cast aspersions of misconduct on police officers in the course of the trial. The defence also sought to distinguish this case as Ler’s role was integral and he was a prime mover, as opposed to that of the present accused. Finally, while there were more charges faced in the accused’s case, the defence argued that this should be taken into account in computing the global sentence, and should not prejudice the sentence for each individual charge.

> (b)      _PP v Mikhy K Farrera Brochez_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 92</span> (“_Mikhy_”). In this related case, Mikhy had pleaded guilty to a similar s 417 charge as Ler, and had received a lesser sentence of **six months’ imprisonment**.

> (c)      _PP v Kho Puay Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 288</span> (“_Kho Puay Meng_”). The accused, Kho, was recruited by one Lim Chun Chyi to participate in a conspiracy to cheat the Ministry of Defence (“MINDEF”) having the accused complete the Individual Proficiency Test (“IPPT”) with a Gold award in lieu of an NSMan, thereby inducing MINDEF to deliver a sum of $400 to the particular NSMan. Kho was sentenced to **two months’ imprisonment** for a single charge under s 420 of the Penal Code. The mastermind, Lim Chun Chyi, had perpetrated this scheme on 93 occasions of physical testing involving 72 NSmen, and caused MINDEF to suffer a total loss of $24,700 (although full restitution was made). Lim was also a serial offender and the prime mover in this case, having pleaded guilty to 20 charges under s 420 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to **three months’ imprisonment for each charge, with six charges to run consecutively for a total of 18 months’ imprisonment**. The defence submitted that apart from the more sophisticated scheme in the present case, the facts were similar to that in Lim and Kho’s case, and the sentence should accordingly be a suitable uplift from 3 months to 6 months’ imprisonment per charge.

> (d)      _PP v Chew Kok Kiang_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 196</span> (“_Chew Kok Kiang_”). The accused in this case was charged with a cheating offence in relation to a Final Driving Theory Test, by instigating someone to sit for the test on his behalf. He was sentenced to **three months’ imprisonment** upon his plea of guilt to a single charge under s 417 read with section 116 of the Penal Code. While the defence conceded that there was no measure of sophistication like that in the present case, nevertheless, the uplift in the present case should not be to a sentence greater than six months’ imprisonment.

30     Finally, in relation to the global sentence, the defence contends that by virtue of the one-transaction principle (see _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span>, at \[27\] and \[30\]), this case involved the violation of the same legally protected interest, and accordingly no more than three of the individual sentences should run consecutively. Second, the defence contended that taking into account the totality principle (see _Mohamed Shouffee_ at \[47\], \[54\]-\[59\], \[63\]), a sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment would be substantially above the highest sentence imposed for a s 417 offence, which would be 18 months according to the Sentencing Information and Research Repository. Such a sentence, given the accused’s background and particular circumstances, would also be considered crushing.

### The Sentence

31     I think it fair to say that this case strikes at the heart of the values of meritocracy which are sacrosanct to our educational system. The GCE O-Level Examination is one of the great levellers of life, and its results are decisive in determining the career pathway of a secondary school graduate. Rich or poor, young or old, every student faces this gateway examination alone, and passes solely on the strength of his or her own merits. The notion that money can purchase a pass in the examination undermines the sanctity of the entire exercise. It makes a mockery of the efforts of tens of thousands of students (and their parents) who put their backs to the millstone every year in this time honoured academic contest to separate the wheat from the chaff.

32     The sentence in this case is therefore highly significant. There is no doubt that deterrence, especially general deterrence, must be the dominant consideration. The sentence must be calibrated not just to punish the wrongdoer appropriately. It must rectify the wrong caused to the system, and present a sufficiently stark warning to deter those who would seek to profit by way of such audacious deception.

33     I will now turn to consider three broad issues that were raised in sentencing. First, how much mitigating weight should be given to the particular background and circumstances of the accused. Second, a consideration of the impact of other relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, benchmarked against previous precedents, to arrive at the appropriate sentence per charge. Finally, the totality of the sentence will be considered.

#### The Background of the Accused and the Circumstances Leading up to the Offence

34     The accused was assessed by Dr Bhanu Gupta, a consultant in the Institute of Mental Health. In his report, he noted that her early childhood was uneventful, with no trauma, bullying or abuse. He recorded her admission that the criminal scheme had begun in 2013, when Pony Poh had asked the accused to register for students and appear at the examinations to facilitate the present scheme. While the accused was aware that this was not legal, she said she had “succumbed” to the request as she thought she was helping the students, and also because she was fearful of Pony (see \[13\] of Dr Bhanu Gupta’s report dated 18 October 2018). Although the accused experienced reluctance when made to help in subsequent rounds of the scheme, and had even raised objections to Pony, the latter was able to divert her concerns or not address the issue (see \[14\] of the said report).

35     In the conclusion of the psychiatric report, Dr Gupta noted that the accused did not present with any formal psychiatric diagnosis. While she had exhibited some traits of Dependent Personality Disorder, she did not fully meet the diagnostic criteria (see \[24\] of the report). He concluded that at the time of the offences, “her mental state was stable and her actions were goal directed, with no impairment in cognition or memory around the period of the offences” (at \[26\] of the report).

36     Dr Gwee Kenji and Dr Kok Yun Fen, both clinical psychologists at the Institute of Mental Health, prepared a psychological report in relation to the accused dated 12 October 2018. They noted that the accused sought to behave in ways that avoided Pony’s wrath (at \[23\] of the report), and even after ending the “toxic” relationship with Pony, the accused’s subsequent relationships were sabotaged by Pony’s interference (at \[24\]-\[26\] of the report). In relation to the offence, the accused had revealed that she had assisted Pony in cheating over a few years (at \[31\] of the report).

37     The psychological assessment for the accused was that while she exhibited some traits of Dependent Personality Disorder (“DPD”) and Avoidant Personality Disorder (at \[44\] of the report), she did not meet the criteria for any other personality disorder. The doctors highlighted that the defining characteristic of DPD is an excessive need to be taken care of, which leads to submissive and clinging behaviour and fears of separation” (at \[47\] of the report). While the accused had exhibited such behaviour, the underlying impetus was her need to boost her own self-esteem and increase other’s liking of her and to “feel worthy to others”. Her healthy levels of independence in other aspects of her life likewise militate against a finding that she needed to be taken care of. Further, contrary to people with Dependent Personality Disorders who display their dysfunction across situations and domains in their lives, the accused exhibited subservience and dependence only to assertive others, namely Pony and her ex-fiance. Accordingly, the doctors found that the accused only met two out of five criteria necessary to establish DPD. As noted by Dr Gwee and Dr Kok in \[56\] of their report:

> \[The accused’s\] personality profile is characterized by wanting to please others, and adopting a strong focus on other’s perception of her. The other-directed vigilance stems not from a need to be taken care of, but rather, making others like her to boost her otherwise fragile self-esteem. \[The accused\] demonstrates independence and rises up to challenges when required, but her independent drive becomes secondary when highly charismatic or assertive individuals get close enough to her to exert their influence.

38     In a nutshell, they concluded that her susceptibility was not clinically pathological” (at \[58\] of the report).

39     The sum total of the two detailed psychiatric and psychological reports ring loud and clear. While the accused was susceptible to certain dominant personality types, she knew the difference between right and wrong, had the ability to control her actions and knew the illegal nature of her assistance in Pony’s schemes. She had multiple opportunities to raise objections over various runs of the scheme which had commenced as early as 2013, but had failed to do so. The accused had placed herself in the thrall of a dominant personality and could not muster the strength to break free. While I am sympathetic to the unfortunate trajectory that her life has taken due to a confluence of poor choices, I am unable to agree with the defence that this should be given mitigating weight. The accused does not suffer from any formal psychiatric condition. To some extent, all criminality is the outcome of bad decision making which is more often than not, rooted in deep-set personality flaws or circumstantial drivers. But while a person maintains control over their faculties, he or she must accept equal responsibility for his or her own actions.

#### Other Aggravating and Mitigating Factors and Comparison with Precedents

40     At the outset, I would express that I am in full agreement with the prosecution on the presence and impact of the aggravating factors raised in their submissions.

41     The question is whether these aggravating factors justify the imposition of the upper end of the range of precedent sentences awarded in similar cases of cheating, where a range of sentences of between two to nine months’ imprisonment have been awarded. To my mind, there are three distinctive factors in the present case which would justify such an uplift.

42     First, the benefit obtained by virtue of the cheating offence is of far greater significance in the present case. The GCE O-Level Examination Certificate is a foundational examination that determines the post-secondary academic route of the candidate. It is a basic qualification that is required for job applications throughout the later stages in life. This renders it of far more lasting impact and benefit as compared to the passing of a fitness test (_Kho Puay Meng_), or the passing of a driving theory test (_Chew Kok Kiang_). It would also be fair to say that the benefit of obtaining a right to work under a Personalised Employment Pass (_Ler Teck Siang_ and _Mikhy_) is far more temporal and limited in financial advantage than the benefit of a GCE O-Level pass. As mentioned earlier, the GCE “O” Level certificate opens doors for life, and is recognised in many jurisdictions beyond our present shores. Accordingly, by dint of this factor alone, the starting point for sentencing cannot be any less than the six months’ imprisonment awarded in _Mikhy_’s case, wherein he had pleaded guilty to a similar s 417 charge involving the deception of a public agency and involving the gain of a significant benefit or advantage. I would therefore respectfully decline the defence’s suggestion that the starting point should be three months’ imprisonment.

43     Second, I was persuaded by the fact that the deception in this case was extremely sophisticated in nature and difficult to detect in practice. In _Ler Teck Siang_ and _Mikhy_’s case, Ler’s act of deception was the swopping his own blood sample for that of Mikhy in order to obtain a negative HIV test result, which was a requirement for the issuance of an employment pass. In the IPPT case of _Koh Puay Meng_, the accused had assumed the identity of an NSMen to take the IPPT test on his behalf, using the identity card of that client. Similarly, in the driving theory test case of _Chew Kok Kiang_, the accused had instigated his friend to sit for the test on his behalf in order to pass the test.

44     These actions pale against the scope and audacity of the operations involved in the present case. The conspiracy hatched by Pony Poh involved multiple parties in a time-sensitive operation to relay questions and answers back and forth between the examination hall and tuition centre. This subterfuge was accomplished by the use of hidden cameras and communication devices. Such acts went beyond the mere swopping of identities or blood samples. The operation was also far more damaging because it was scaleable to a high degree. Indeed, the beneficiaries of the examination answers numbered six candidates, and could have potentially expanded to an untold number of students if so warranted. Finally, the cost of prevention would have been prohibitively high, given the ease with which communication devices could be hidden on the bodies of students. The only realistic method of prevention would have been intrusive checks at the start of examinations. We should rue the day where the incidence of cheating becomes so rampant that students have to be subjected to metal detectors and body searches in order to prevent such abuse. Quite apart from resource concerns, the deployment of such counter measures would grievously undermine the ethics of honesty, hard work and self-reliance which the educational system seeks to inspire amongst the young. It is amply clear that a deterrent sentence is needed to avoid this undesirable outcome.

45     The third differentiating factor that distinguishes the present case from the precedent cases is the wider impact of the deceptive act. As pointed out by the prosecution, this act of cheating sought to defraud an internationally recognised examination. The impact of such deception went beyond flouting localised requirements, such as IPPT testing, work permit applications and tests for driving proficiency. The incident was reported in the international media, and had tarnished the reputation of Singapore as an education centre. The impact on our national reputation, as well as the more invidious assault on meritocracy as a central value of our nation state, renders this case far more aggravated than the other precedent cases cited.

46     I next considered the mitigating factors that were raised in support of the accsued. I noted that the accused was not the mastermind of the scheme, and was a first-time offender. I also considered that she had pleaded guilty, although I did not accord this factor with considerable weight, as she had only done so at the doorstep of trial, and there was clearly overwhelming evidence as to her guilt. Further, while I accepted that the accused was not the mastermind, I noted that she did profit from the receipt of remuneration from a tuiton centre that offered “guarantees” for examination passes in return for high tuition fees. I would thus reject the argument by the defence that the accused did not receive any financial benefit from her offences.

47     On balance, I accepted the position in _Mikhy_ of six months’ imprisonment being the starting point for a plea of guilt to a cheating offence involving a public agency, where the benefit or advantage sought to be obtained involved long-term financial gain. Given the second and third factors highlighted above, namely the sophistication of the operation and the difficulty of detection, as well as the degree of harm caused by the act of deception, I was minded to further uplift the sentence for the charge of abetment to cheat by conspiracy to one of nine months’ imprisonment as proposed by the prosecution. I am mindful that this posits the sentence at a quarter mark along the sentencing range, affording greater headroom for similar offenders with even higher culpability than that of the accused.

48     For completeness, I would also briefly address the sentencing consideration for the inchoate offence, although it has no impact on the total sentence as I have directed it to run concurrently. I note that in _Chew Kok Kiang_, the applicable sentence at that point of time was a maximum of three months’ imprisonment for a similar inchoate charge in that case (s 417 read with s 116 of the Penal Code), and that this was the sentence imposed by the district court. The prosecution in the present case has not requested for the present applicable maximum sentence of nine months’ imprisonment for the inchoate charge. Instead, they have requested for a nine or ten week sentence of imprisonment, which is proportionately at the same point of the sentencing spectrum as the requested sentence of nine months’ imprisonment for the charges where the offence was committed. Accordingly, I found that a sentence of nine weeks’ imprisonment would be sufficient for this case.

#### The Sentence in Totality

49     The prosecution had requested for four of 26 charges under s 417 read with s 109 of the Penal Code to run consecutively. This would result in a total sentence of 36 months, which is the maximum sentence that could be imposed on a single cheating charge.

50     In contrast, the defence submits that the total sentence should comprise of no more than three consecutive sentences of six months each, for a total of 18 months’ imprisonment, relying on the one-transaction rule and the totality principle.

51     At the outset, I did not find the one transaction rule to be of assistance to the defence in the present case. The instances of cheating took place over five separate examination sessions from 19 to 24 October 2016. Each act was committed and concluded for distinct examination papers in respect of each of the students involved. The mere fact that several distinct offences are committed in a short span of time should not result in a more lenient sentenced being imposed (per _Public Prosecutor v Lee Cheow Loong Charles_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 124</span> at \[24\]).

52     As far as the totality principle is concerned, I note that the total sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment requested by the prosecution does not exceed the maximum sentence that can be imposed on a single charge of cheating under s 417 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. In any case, where there are multiple charges involved (there being a total of 26 in this case), I do not see it necessary to be unduly restrained by the maximum sentence provided for the “most serious offence” (see _Navaseelan Balasingam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR 767</span> at \[27\]). To constrain the sentencing exercise in such fashion would be to ignore the severity of the multiple instances of offending in these circumstances, and convey the impression that a discount was being given the more times one committed an offence.

53     Next, turning to the second limb of the totality principle, I do not accept that a term of 36 months’ of imprisonment imposed on a 32 year-old offender would be considered crushing by any stretch of the phrase. The accused has suffered a setback early in life, for which she has to pay to pay her dues. She has more than a reasonable expectation of useful life upon release, and cannot be said to be left in a state of despondency with no hope for the future. Quite to the contrary, it is hoped that this episode serves as a timely wake-up call for the accused to steer clear of characters towards whom she claims to be susceptible, and to exercise good judgment in the pursuit of her own best interests when under pressure from such personalities.

54     Having taken into account all relevant considerations, and for the above reasons cited, I directed that four charges under s 417 read with s 109 of the Penal Code run consecutively, and sentenced the accused to a total of 36 months’ imprisonment. I granted the accused a short deferment of sentence until 22 April 2019. The accused has commenced the serving of sentence, and has not applied for a stay pending appeal.
