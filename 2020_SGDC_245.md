TORT – Negligence – Contributory negligence

21 October 2020

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff brought the present action against the defendant for personal injuries that she had suffered in an accident when she rode as a pillion rider on a motorcycle controlled by the third party. The accident occurred on 1 July 2017 at approximately 11.00 pm at the controlled cross junction of New Bridge Road and Upper Cross Street. As the plaintiff was the pillion rider, it is undisputed between the parties that the plaintiff bears no contributory negligence. As this is a bifurcated trial, the dispute is on the apportionment of liability between the defendant and the third party.

2       After hearing the evidence and considering the parties’ submissions, I decide to apportion the liability equally between the defendant and the third party. I set out the grounds for my decision below.

## Facts

### The parties

3       On the night of the accident, the plaintiff had dinner with the third party before both then rode off in the latter’s motorcycle, FY 8191B. The defendant was driving his motorcar, EF 998E after he had his dinner. It is undisputed that both the defendant and the third party were travelling in the same direction and had stopped at the traffic lights at the cross junction of New Bridge Road and Upper Cross Street as the traffic light was red. After the traffic light turned green, the motorcycle and the motorcar moved forward and had a collision. The defendant and the third party had conflicting versions of how the accident happened. After the accident, the motorcycle landed on the ground and the plaintiff fell and suffered a comminuted fracture to her elbow. It is also undisputed between parties that the defendant’s motorcar left wing mirror was folded in after the accident.

4       A total of three witnesses gave evidence in court. They were the plaintiff, the defendant and the third party. No independent witness was present in court to testify. Defendant had urged the Court to treat the plaintiff’s evidence with caution.[^1] I am prepared to accept that the plaintiff gave evidence objectively although she and the third party are known to each other.[^2] I will proceed to evaluate the evidence presented by all parties later in this Judgment and the material inconsistencies in such evidence. Nothing turns on the pleadings.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

5       The plaintiff and the third party were travelling on the third party’s motorcycle along Upper Cross Street and the motorcycle stopped at the junction with New Bridge Road as the traffic light was red. The motorcycle was directly in front of the defendant’s motorcar. When the traffic light turned green, the third party moved slowly forward but the defendant’s motorcar overtook the motorcycle from the right causing the motorcar’s left-wing mirror to hit the motorcycle’s right handlebar. Both the plaintiff and the defendant fell to the ground and the plaintiff hurt her right elbow.[^3] After she was conveyed to the Singapore General Hospital, she was told that she had suffered a fracture of her right elbow.[^4]

### The defendant’s version

6       According to the defendant, he was travelling along Upper Cross Street towards the Central Expressway on the 3rd lane. There are five lanes at the junction of Upper Cross Street with New Bridge Road. The extreme right lane allows vehicles to only turn right into Eu Tong Sen Street. The 2nd lane allows vehicles to either turn right towards Eu Tong Sen Street or proceed straight. The 3rd lane allows motor vehicles to only proceed straight. The 4th lane allows motor vehicles to either proceed straight or turn left towards New Bridge Road. The extreme left lane allows motor vehicles to only turn left towards New Bridge Road.[^5]

7       As the traffic light turned red when he was approaching the junction, he stopped his motorcar behind the stop line. His evidence was that the motorcycle was not in front of his motorcar but was straddling between lanes 2 and 3[^6]. He realized that the motorcycle was next to his motorcar only after the accident. This was because after the traffic light turned green, he moved his motorcar for about 5 metres from the white stop line, he heard a noise coming from the left rear of his motorcar. He turned to his left and noticed that his left-wing mirror had folded in.[^7]

8       After he had alighted from his motorcar, he noticed that there were scratches to the front left passenger door and the left side of his rear bumper.[^8]

9       On 9 July 2017, he received a letter from the Traffic Police which stated that he was to pay $200 composition fine for inconsiderate driving[^9] which was a charge under section 65(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed). After his appeal against this charge[^10], the Traffic Police agreed to drop the charge.[^11]

10     In his appeal letter to the Traffic Police (“appeal letter”) dated 17 July 2017[^12], he informed that his motorcar was on 3rd lane and the motorcycle was straddling between 3rd lane and 4th lane. When the traffic light turned green, he moved forward. The third party’s motorcycle moved closer to the left side of his motorcar and the third party’s hand had touched his left door mirror. The third party lost his balance and fell.

### The third party’s version

11     The defendant’s version was similar to that of the plaintiff. His evidence was that he was the first vehicle in that lane and the defendant had stopped his vehicle behind his motorcycle. When the traffic light turned green, he accelerated slowly when the defendant’s motorcar overtook him from his right. The left-wing mirror of the defendant’s vehicle collided into his right handlebar, causing him to lose balance and both the plaintiff and the third party fell.[^13]

## Issues to be determined

12     In light of the conflicting versions put forth by the parties, the Court has to determine how the accident had happened which in turn has a bearing on the apportionment of liability between the defendant and the third party. The issues are as follows:

> a. What were the positions of the motorcycle and motorcar when both vehicles had stopped at the traffic junction while waiting for the traffic light to turn green?

> b. How did both vehicles move forward when the traffic light turned green? Did either vehicle encroach unto the path of the other vehicle?

## Issue 1: What were the positions of the vehicles when stationary at the traffic junction

13     There are two conflicting versions put forth by parties as regards their relative position to each vehicle at the traffic junction while waiting for the traffic light to turn green. The plaintiff and the third party assert that the motorcycle was in front of the defendant’s motorcar in the 3rd lane[^14]. However, the defendant’s version is that the motorcycle was straddling the 3rd and 4th lanes, on the left of his motorcar. The third party took issue with the defendant’s version which was not stated in the defendant’s General Insurance Association (“GIA”) accident statement and police report[^15] and was found in the appeal letter.

14     In this regard, I find that the defendant’s motorcar was on the right of the motorcycle and was straddling the 3rd and 4th lanes of the traffic junction. As rightly pointed out by the defendant[^16], this position has been similarly stated by the plaintiff in her opening statement[^17]. This position has also been reflected in the defendant’s appeal letter[^18]. Another reason why I find the defendant’s version to be more credible is because the sketch plan drawn by the third party in his GIA accident statement filed on 3 July 2017[^19], which was 2 days after the accident also showed the motorcycle to be on the left of the motorcar. Therefore, despite the third party taking issue with the defendant’s version[^20], both the documents from the plaintiff and the third party support the defendant’s version of the position of the vehicles vis a vis each other at the traffic junction while waiting for the traffic light to turn green.

## Issue 2: How did the vehicles move forward after the traffic light turned green

15     This is a hotly contested issue between parties. There are two conflicting versions put forth by the parties. The defendant has one version. The third party and the plaintiff have another version. According to the defendant, the third party had moved closer to the left side of the Defendant’s motorcar, lost balance, fell and hit the left side passenger door and back left bumper of his motorcar. For the third party and the plaintiff, their version was that the defendant’s motorcar overtook the motorcycle from the right and collided into the right handlebar of the motorcycle, causing the motorcycle to fall unto its right.

16     All three witnesses who attended court gave evidence with inconsistencies. The plaintiff, who was injured in the accident was not able to recount clearly how the accident occurred. In her AEIC[^21], her version of how the accident occurred was that the Defendant’s motorcar overtook the motorcycle from behind on the right side. And when doing so, the Defendant’s left-wing mirror hit the motorcycle’s right handlebar, causing the motorcycle to fall resulting in the Plaintiff’s injuries. In the SGH medical report recorded by the SGH hospital staff[^22], the Plaintiff’s version was that “vehicle passed by a car and lost balance.” The third party took issue with reliance by the defendant on this medical report as the maker, Dr Jasmine Lee, was not called to court[^23]. When cross-examined as to the two different versions, she was uncertain and conceded that she did not know how the car hit the motorcycle[^24]. She insisted that she was in pain and not “really sure of everything”[^25]. Yet she was able to distinctly recall that the Defendant’s motorcar left wing mirror had folded in after the accident[^26].

17     The defendant’s version was that the motorcycle veered into the path of his motorcar and caused the accident[^27]. The details captured in the version stated in his appeal letter were not found in his police report lodged on 2 July 2017[^28], a few hours after the accident. He had two different versions relating to the damage to his motorcar as a result of the accident. In his police report of 2 July 2917 and his oral evidence given in court, he stated that his motorcar suffered scratches or marks to the front left passenger door and also left side of the bumper.[^29] But in his appeal letter at paragraph 3[^30], he stated clearly that there was no damage to his car “except for a light scratch mark on the left side of the rear bumper[^31].” This same observation was made by the third party.[^32]His evidence in court and in his appeal letter to the Traffic Police was that the Defendant’s hand had touched his left-wing mirror and lost his balance. The Defendant also testified that the left-wing mirror of his car had folded in after the accident. In his oral testimony in court, he initially said that the Defendant’s hand touched the wing mirror of the motorcar[^33]. Then his version changed to the motorcycle touching his motorcar left wing mirror before the motorcycle fell[^34].

18     As for the Third Party, his version was the Defendant overtook his motorcycle, moving very fast. Further, his motorcycle was the first vehicle in front of the Defendant’s motorcar with the Defendant’s motorcar as the second vehicle[^35]. However, this version was not possible[^36]. As pointed out by the Defendant’s counsel, this version was not plausible as the lane on the Defendant’s right had to be vacant, devoid of vehicles, otherwise the Defendant’s motorcar would have collided into the vehicle in the lane on the Defendant’s right side when attempting the overtaking manoeuvre[^37]. It was unchallenged in court that the next land to the right of the defendant’s motorcar had a vehicle in that lane.

19     I find that at the point of collision, the right handlebar of the motorcycle was in front of the motorcar’s left-wing mirror such that upon collision, the motorcar’s left-wing mirror folded inwards. Further, the plaintiff’s personal injuries evidently showed that the motorcycle fell on the right. Looking at the photograph produced by the defendant as part of his appeal letter, his motorcar was within his lane at the point of collision and the direction was straight[^38]. In other words, the motorcar was not positioned towards the left or right direction of the lane. Hence, the defendant did not overtake the third party’s motorcycle asserted by the plaintiff and the third party.

20     As there were inconsistencies in all witnesses’ evidence as I have pointed out earlier, all parties have not proven their versions of how the accident occurred on a balance of probabilities. I find that the accident happened as the motorcar and the motorcycle had both moved forward after the traffic light turned green without ensuring safe distance between them. This resulted in a sideswipe between the left-wing mirror of the motorcar and the right handlebar of the motorcycle. The impact caused the left-wing mirror of the motorcar to fold inwards. When the motorcycle became unbalanced as a result of the impact, it fell on its right and hit the left side of the bumper of the motorcar. My finding is consistent with the accident photographs[^39] that suggest damage to the left rear bumper of the motorcar and the handlebar of the motorcycle.

21     As for apportionment of liability for a side-swipe situation, this is covered in the State Courts, _A GUIDE ON THE ASSESSMENT OF LIAIBILITY IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CASES (Might Minds Publishing Pte Ltd, 2014)._ At p 75, a side-swipe accident between two vehicles going straight without encroaching into each other’s path results in equal apportionment of liability between parties. The reasons for this apportionment are that both vehicles should keep a lookout for vehicles entering their path and take evasive action to avoid a collision.

## Conclusion

22     For the above reasons, I find that both defendant and third party failed to keep a safe distance between each other and failed to take evasive action when traversing forward when traffic lights turned green in their favour. Because of their failure to do so, their vehicles had a side-swipe collision with each other.

23     I give interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff with damages to be assessed by the registrar at equal apportionment of liability between the defendant and third party. I award the sum of $6,000 as costs of the trial on liability. The costs of the assessment of damages would be decided by the registrar.
