Sale of Goods – Good faith – in the ordinary course of business – without authority of legal owner – section 2, Factors Act

19 December 2019

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff and her family visited the 1st Defendant’s showroom at No. 15 Commonwealth Lane and bought a vehicle (Toyota Vellfire SLQ7290B) (“the car”) from the 1st Defendant on 26 August 2017. In the purchase of the car from the 1st Defendant, the Plaintiff dealt with one Lim Wei Qiang Jeremy who was said to be an employee of the 1st Defendant and one Sam, who was said to be the “boss”. The Plaintiff collected the car on 30 August 2017 from the 1st Defendant’s showroom and paid the sum of $132,143 via a UOB cash cheque (cheque no.002305 dated 30 August 2017). The Plaintiff had already paid $500 as a deposit, thus making the amount $132,643 as the total amount paid by her for the car.

2       The evidence from UOB shows that the cheque was encashed by one “Marcus Heng Tze Wei” the next day, i.e., 31 August 2017[^1]. The Plaintiff’s testimony is that when she turned up at the 1st Defendant’s showroom to collect the car on 30 August 2017, this same Marcus was present and he was the one who prepared the agreement for the sale of the car for the Plaintiff’s execution.[^2]

3       The 2nd Defendant is in the business of hire purchase financing for motor vehicles. Under a Floor Stock Facilities Agreement dated 21 July 2017 between the 2nd Defendant and the 1st Defendant, the 2nd Defendant handed possession of the car over to the 1st Defendant for the 1st Defendant’s sale of the car.

4       On 11 May 2018, the 2nd Defendant repossessed the car without notice to the Plaintiff. It is not disputed that the 2nd Defendant remained the registered owner of the car at all material times until it was sold to Mova Automotive Pte Ltd (“Mova”) on 17 May 2018[^3].

5       According to the 2nd Defendant’s manager, Lee Yan Hua, sometime around early November 2017, the 1st Defendant reported to the 2nd Defendant that their employee, Jeremy had fled the country with a sum of money[^4]. As things would later turn out, it would appear that the Plaintiff is but one of 17 victims who filed police reports and police investigations revealed that they are all involved in a fraud that entailed the purchase of cars from the 1st Defendant but the ownerships were never transferred to the buyers.

6       At trial, this suit proceeded only as against the 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiff’s claim against the 2nd Defendant is on the basis that at all material times, the 1st Defendant was a mercantile agent or buyer in possession of the car with the 2nd Defendant’s consent and the car was sold to the Plaintiff in the ordinary course of the 1st Defendant’s business. The Plaintiff claims that therefore as far as she is aware, she was the legal and beneficial owner in possession of the car and that therefore, when the 2nd Defendant took possession of the car without her consent, the 2nd Defendant had thereby converted the car to its own use.

7       As the car has already been sold to Mova at the price of $122,000, the Plaintiff’s claim for damages for conversion against the 2nd Defendant is the said sum as the Plaintiff is prepared to accept the said amount as the market price of the car[^5].

## Issues In This Case

8       The Plaintiff’s pleaded case is that the 1st Defendant was a mercantile agent or buyer in possession of the car with the 2nd Defendant’s consent and that the car was sold to her in the ordinary course of the 1st Defendant’s business. The Plaintiff’s case is therefore premised on the fact that she had obtained good title to the car by virtue of sections 2 and 9 of the Factors Act and section 25 of the Sale of Goods Act.

9       At trial, counsel for both parties identified and agreed on the following four issues as the issues for the purpose of the trial:

> (a)     Whether the Plaintiff had paid value for the car;

> (b)     Whether the Plaintiff was a _bona fide_ purchaser;

> (c)     Whether the 1st Defendant’s sale of the car to the Plaintiff was made by the 1st Defendant acting in the ordinary course of business; and

> (d)     Whether the Plaintiff had, at the time of the sale, notice that the 1st Defendant did not have the authority to sell the car.

10     In their Defence, the 2nd Defendant had merely denied the Plaintiff’s assertions as follows:

> (a)     That the Plaintiff was put on notice through LTA’s records that are publicly available that the 2nd Defendant was the registered owners[^6];

> (b)     That the Plaintiff could have and should have at any time requested for the 1st Defendant’s confirmation of their ownership and ability to transfer good title to the car[^7];

> (c)     That the Plaintiff would have or should have known to perform her due diligence by conducting the necessary checks on the car’s registration, road tax status and insurance[^8];

> (d)     That it is common practice for LTA to notify both buyer and seller in writing upon the sale of a vehicle and the fact that the Plaintiff had continued to use the car for more than 8 months without questioning why she had not received any such notification from LTA is indicative of bad faith on her part[^9].

In short, the crux of the 2nd Defendant’s defence is that the Plaintiff knew or ought to have known of the 2nd Defendant’s title and has therefore acted in bad faith in taking possession of the car against that knowledge[^10]. This defence is carried through in the affidavit of evidence in chief of the 2nd Defendant’s manager, Lee Yan Hua[^11].

11     Thus, the issues highlighted in paragraph 9(a) to (d) above are not issues arising from the 2nd Defendant’s pleaded case but are issues arising from the elements that the Plaintiff has to establish for the purpose of her reliance on the operation of the law as found in the Factors Act and Sale of Goods Act. I will deal with these issues first before moving on to deal with issues arising from the 2nd Defendant’s Defence.

#### Whether the Plaintiff paid value for the car and whether she is a bona fide purchaser of value

12     As evident from the documents disclosed by UOB pursuant to the Order of Court made in the Plaintiff’s application for discovery (DC/SUM 1814/2019)[^12], the Plaintiff had issued a UOB cash cheque no. 002305 dated 30 August 2017 for the sum $132,143.00[^13], which was encashed by one Marcus. As far as the Plaintiff is aware, Marcus was an employee of the 1st Defendant at the material time and he was also the one who prepared the sale agreement for execution by the Plaintiff when she collected the car from the 1st Defendant’s showroom. The Plaintiff also took delivery of the car from the 1st Defendant’s showroom on 30 August 2017 and drove it for over 8 months before it was repossessed by the 2nd Defendant on 11 May 2018[^14]. There is no evidence whatsoever to show that the Plaintiff had not paid value for the car or that she had no right to take possession of the car when she collected the car from the 1st Defendant on 30 August 2017. Accordingly, it is clear the Plaintiff had paid value for the car to the 1st Defendant and is a bona fide purchaser for value.

#### Whether the 1st Defendant’s sale of the car to the Plaintiff was made by the 1st Defendant acting in the ordinary course of business

13     In closing submissions, the 2nd Defendant argues that the Plaintiff has failed to prove that the 1st Defendant is a mercantile agent of the 2nd Defendant or a buyer in possession of the car with the consent of the 2nd Defendant and that the 1st Defendant had sold the car in the ordinary course of business. The crux of this argument is premised on the fact that the Plaintiff had failed to call the director of the 1st Defendant or any of the employees who had allegedly dealt with the Plaintiff in the sale transaction, such as Jeremy, Marcus and Sam, as a witness.

14     The arguments that the 2nd Defendant attempted to mount in their closing submissions simply does not hold water. It is not disputed that the 1st Defendant is in the business of selling second hand cars. In fact, by the 2nd Defendant’s own evidence[^15], it was the 2nd Defendant who had financed the purchase of the car for the 1st Defendant to sell at the 1st Defendant’s showroom under its Floor Stock Financing Agreement between the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant. Clearly, there is no dispute that the 1st Defendant came into possession of the car (that was sold to the Plaintiff) with the consent of the 2nd Defendant.

15     Section 2 of the Factors Act provides, “Where a mercantile agent _is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of goods, any sale_ …., made by him when acting in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent, _shall, subject to the provision of this Act, be valid as if he were expressly authorized by the owner of the goods to make the same_..”

16     This is clear from section 2 : In order for section 2 to operate to deem the sale valid as if the 1st Defendant was expressly authorized by the 2nd Defendant (who is the owner of the car) to make the sale, the 1st Defendant’s possession of the car for sale must be shown to be with the consent of the 2nd Defendant. This is clearly not in dispute. The 2nd Defendant had allowed the car to be placed in the 1st Defendant’s showroom for sale by the 1st Defendant pursuant to the Floor Stock Financing Agreement between them. The sale of the car occurred at the 1st Defendant’s showroom where the car had been on display for the purpose of sale. The sale price of the car was at market value and the Plaintiff purchased the car at or around that price[^16].

17     Accordingly, it is clear that the sale of the car to the Plaintiff was made in the ordinary course of the 1st Defendant’s business. There is no allegation in the 2nd Defendant’s pleadings that this was not the case. There is also no evidence whatsoever to suggest that this was not the case. It is immaterial the Plaintiff had not called the director of the 1st Defendant, or the employees of the 1st Defendant such as Jeremy or Marcus or Sam as a witness. I accept her explanation at trial that she could not locate them and her testimony that the police had informed her that they were already investigating Sam, Jeremy and Marcus[^17].

#### Whether the Plaintiff had, at the time of the sale, notice that the 1st Defendant did not have the authority to sell the car

18     This issue falls within the proviso to section 2 of the Factors Act, which reads:

> 2\. – (1)    Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of goods or of the document of title to goods, any sale, pledge, or other disposition of the goods, made by him when acting in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent, shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be as valid as if he were expressly authorized by the owner of the goods to make the same.

>> Provided that the person taking under the disposition _acts in good faith_, and _has not at the time of disposition notice that the person making the disposition has no authority to make the same._ (Emphasis added)

19     In the affidavit of evidence in chief of the 2nd Defendant’s witness, Lee Yan Hua, the contention of the 2nd Defendant is that the requirements in the proviso are not met because[^18]:

> (a)     the Plaintiff did not make the proper enquiries regarding the ownership of the car by writing to the LTA or by checking the LTA website or by asking for the log card from the 1st Defendant[^19];

> (b)     the Plaintiff paid the sale price for the car by way of a cash cheque[^20];

> (c)     the Plaintiff did not ask for a receipt for her payment[^21];

> (d)     the Plaintiff did not look out for the LTA transfer letter or question why she did not receive such a letter[^22]; and

> (e)     the Plaintiff did not raise any query regarding the road tax on the car despite having the car for 8 months[^23].

20     On a plain reading of the proviso in section 2 of the Factors Act, section 2 of the Factors Act would not apply if:

> (a)     The Plaintiff _did not act in good faith_; and

> (b)      _had notice that the 1_ st _Defendant has no authority to sell the car._

21     First, it is not the 2nd Defendant’s case that the 1st Defendant did not have the authority of the 2nd Defendant to sell the car[^24]. In closing submissions, the Plaintiff argues that the 1st Defendant obviously had the authority from the 2nd Defendant to sell the car as this was the very premise of the business relationship between the 1st and 2nd Defendants. In its opening statement, the 2nd Defendant tried to suggest that the 1st Defendant did not have such authority to sell the car[^25]. The argument is as follows – the 1st Defendant is required to notify the 2nd Defendant of any sale of the car; by failing to do so, the 1st Defendant was in repudiatory breach of the Floor Stock Financing Agreement and was deemed to be no longer in possession of the car with the 2nd Defendant’s consent.

22     This argument fails to distinguish between the effect of a breach of the Floor Stock Financing Agreement by the 1st Defendant vis-à-vis the 2nd Defendant and that vis-à-vis third parties who have purchased goods owned by the 2nd Defendant from the 1st Defendant. The fact remains that any breach of the Floor Stock Financing Agreement by the 1st Defendant is a matter between the 1st and 2nd Defendants. A third party such as the Plaintiff who has purchased from the 1st Defendant is not privy to and therefore cannot be bound by the Floor Stock Financing Agreement or be held liable for or be made to suffer the consequences of such breaches by the 1st Defendant. It is for the 2nd Defendant to look to the 1st Defendant for compensation arising from such breaches.

23     Further, the 2nd Defendant’s argument is untenable because, if such a requirement under the Floor Stock Financing Agreement exists, the 1st Defendant is only in a position to notify the 2nd Defendant after a sale is concluded[^26]. There could not have been any breach by the 1st Defendant at the time the Plaintiff entered into the sale agreement with the 1st Defendant.

24     The facts of the case show that possession of the car was given by the 2nd Defendant to the 1st Defendant in order for the car to be sold. Consequently, the 1st Defendant did have consent or actual authority from the 2nd Defendant to sell the car. Further, there is simply no evidence whatsoever to show that the Plaintiff was in any way aware that the 1st Defendant does not have any consent or authority from the 2nd Defendant to sell the car.

25     As for the test for “good faith”, the description is as found in the extract from Sweet & Maxwell, _Benjamin’s Sale of Goods_ (8th Ed., 2010) (“_Benjamin’s Sale of Goods_”) at \[7-046\][^27]:

> The expression “in good faith” is not defined in the Act of 1889 but would appear to _mean “honestly”, that is to say, not fraudulently or dishonestly._ It is submitted that _negligence or carelessness is not in itself sufficient evidence of bad faith_ and the fact that the person dealing with the agent did not behave with the prudence to be expected of a reasonable man does not mean that he acted in bad faith.

> _On the other hand, negligence or carelessness, when considered in connection with the surrounding circumstances, may be evidence of bad faith. But the facts and circumstances should then be such as to lead to the inference that the disponee must have had a suspicion that there was something wrong, and that he refrained from asking questions because he thought that further enquiry would reveal an irregularity._ ... Although it has been said that the courts view with suspicion any dealing with a second-hand motor vehicle without the registration document_, a failure on the part of the buyer to ask for the registration document of a second-hand vehicle does not necessarily show bad faith_ and may be of little evidentiary value in the case of the sale of a new vehicle.

26     Similarly, section 61(2) of the Sale of Goods Act[^28] states that:-

> _A thing is deemed to be done in good faith within the meaning of this Act when it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not._

27     In the context of a sale of goods, the test for a lack of good faith is therefore clear. It must be established that there was actual dishonesty or fraud. Mere negligence is not good enough, even if negligence is established. Where it is alleged that the buyer was negligent, the facts and circumstances must be such that the buyer was or should have been suspicious that something was wrong but deliberately refrained from making inquiries.

28     The 2nd Defendant has not alleged in their pleadings or adduced any evidence to show that the Plaintiff was in any way dishonest or had acted dishonestly or fraudulently. On the facts of this case, the Plaintiff went to the 1st Defendant’s showroom to purchase the car. Presumably, there were other vehicles for sale there. There were a few employees at the showroom of the 1st Defendant. For the purchase, there was a sale agreement and the Plaintiff was given the sale agreement to execute. Thereafter, she collected the car and drove off. At the time of the transaction, there was nothing about the sale transaction that should have raised alarm bells or which the Plaintiff should have been suspicious of.

29     As for the requirement in section 2 of the Factors Act that it must be established that the Plaintiff did not have notice that the 1st Defendant did not have authority to sell the car for the said provision to apply, the 2nd Defendant’s contention is that the Plaintiff ought to have checked LTA’s records and ought to have known that the 1st Defendant did not have ownership of the car. On this contention, I will cite _Benjamin’s Sale of Goods_ at \[7-047\][^29] where it is stated:-

> It is submitted that, in the context of the Factors Act 1889 and of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, _“notice” of a fact prima facie means actual knowledge of that fact_. But, as was pointed out by Lord Tenterden in Evans v Trueman:

>> “A person may have knowledge of a fact either by direct communication or by being aware of the circumstances which must lead a reasonable man applying his mind to them, and judging from them, to the conclusion that the fact is so. Knowledge acquired in either of these ways is enough, I think, to exclude a party from the benefit of the provisions of this statute: a slight suspicion, I think, will not.”

30     Therefore, in order for the Plaintiff to be deemed to have notice that the 1st Defendant did not have authority to sell the car, it must be established that she either has actual knowledge of that fact or the circumstances are such that a reasonable person in her shoes would have her suspicions aroused and that she wilfully shut her eyes to the means of knowledge available to her.

31     On the facts of this case, the Plaintiff went to a second-hand car dealership with a proper showroom and purchased a vehicle that was on display for sale. I accept the Plaintiff’s argument in closing submissions that even if the Plaintiff had made further enquiries as regards the ownership of the car, it would still not affect the transaction as that would still point to the fact that 1st Defendant had possession of the car with the consent of and with the authority from the 2nd Defendant to sell the car. In fact, the finance scheme that the 1st Defendant had entered into with the 2nd Defendant via the Floor Stock Financing Agreement was for the purpose of enabling the 1st Defendant to conduct its business in the sale of second-hand vehicles. Selling a car that is under financing with the legal ownership of the car belonging to the hire purchase company is not at all an unusual practice especially in the context of Singapore where motor vehicles are very expensive items.

32     I will also quote my brother judge, District Judge Loo Ngan Chor in _Kau Joo Guan v Kwek Seow Hui t/a Car Dynasty and One Motor Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 279</span> (“_Kau Joo Guan_”) at \[21\][^30] where he said:

> _When a second hand car buyer walks into a dealer’s shop to view cars, the last thing he expects is that the dealer has no right to sell the cars on display. Otherwise, why would these cars be in his shop in the first place? That is the common sense of brick and mortar second hand car sales. This is notwithstanding the occasional newspaper article on problems encountered with second hand car dealers, which the sensible consumer would hardly retain in his head so that he would view a potential dealer vendor with suspicion. I do not think that generally – such being my own experience over time from the days when we had registration books until now when we no longer have registration books – one would ask to look at the so-called log card._

33     The case of _Kau Joo Guan_ is especially instructive as it concerns a similar factual scenario. In that case, Kau (the plaintiff) had purchased a Mercedes C180K car (“the Mercedes”) at the price of $103,000 from Car Dynasty (the 1st defendant). The Mercedes in that case was owned by One Motor Pte Ltd (the 2nd defendant). Kau paid the full purchase price to Car Dynasty by way of several cash cheques. Although Car Dynasty promised to register the transfer of the ownership of the Mercedes, this was never done and Car Dynasty subsequently absconded. Car Dynasty had purchased the Mercedes through financing provided by One Motor. The LTA records showed that One Motor was the owner of the Mercedes. According to the agreement between Car Dynasty and One Motor, One Motor remained the legal and beneficial owner of the Mercedes.

34     Similar arguments were mounted by One Motor in that case, with the contention that Kau did not act in good faith as he:

> (a)     did not ask to see the log card;

> (b)     had some meetings with Car Dynasty at cafes; and

> (c)     made payment by way of cash cheques.

35     The arguments were rejected by District Judge Loo Ngan Chor. At \[20\][^31], he stated that:

> “In my view, these considerations singly or combined do not at all suggest a lack of good faith or the turning of a blind eye. Even if they were suggestive of negligence, which I do not think they were, s61 SGA says that an act is deemed done in good faith “when it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not.” I find that the plaintiff’s dealings with the 1st defendant were nothing more or less than those of an honest buyer of a used car.”

In the case of _Kau Joo Guan_, District Judge Loo concluded that Kau acted in good faith despite the following : he did not ask to see the log card; he had some meetings with Car Dynasty at cafes; and he made payment by way of cash cheques.

36     Similarly, I will make the same conclusion as regards the 2nd Defendant’s contention that the Plaintiff did not act in good faith as she did not check the LTA records as regards ownership of the car; as she did not look out for the LTA transfer letter or question why she did not receive such a letter and as she did not check with LTA as regards road tax despite having the car for 8 months – that these do not show lack of good faith, even if I were to find that the Plaintiff had been “negligent” in not taking these steps.

37     I am of the view that between the 2nd Defendant and the Plaintiff, the 2nd Defendant is in a better position to take steps to minimise risk of losses caused by a scam of the nature found in this case. In this regard, I adopt the remarks made by my brother judge in _Kau Joo Guan_ at \[22\][^32]:

> _If anything, I am humbly of the view that it is for men of commerce such as the 2nd defendant, and others who provide finance for car dealers, in the same trade, knowing their co-dealers, and alive to its pitfalls, to organize their ways of doing business so that they do not become traps for the unwary car buyer._

38     As for the 2nd Defendant’s contention that the Plaintiff ought not have paid by way of a cash cheque, I will say that this contention is totally without merit. The established facts did not give any reason for the Plaintiff to question the requested mode of payment or to ask for a receipt. In any event, even if the Plaintiff had been issued with a receipt by the 1st Defendant, it would not have changed the fact that the 2nd Defendant remained in LTA’s records as the owner with legal title.

## Conclusion

39     In conclusion, I find that the Plaintiff had obtained good title to the car. By seizing the car and disposing of it, the 2nd Defendant is thereby liable to the Plaintiff under conversion for her loss and damage. As stated in _Benjamin’s Sale of Goods_ at \[17-105\][^33]:-

> “Where the property in the goods and the immediate right to possession of them has passed to the buyer, he may bring against the seller a proprietary action for chattels under the law of torts, viz. proceedings for wrongful interference with the goods seeking an order for the specific delivery of the goods, or an action for damages for conversion when the seller’s detention of the goods amounts to a denial of the buyer’s title to them. … The buyer, by virtue of his immediate right to possession of the goods, may also be entitled to bring these tortious actions against strangers: thus he may recover the full value of the goods from a stranger who converts them by taking them out of the possession of the seller.”

40     As the Plaintiff is prepared to accept the sale price of the car when the car was sold to Mova on 17 May 2018 as the market value of the car and using that quantum as the quantum that represents her loss, the Plaintiff’s claim is accordingly allowed with damages in the sum of $122,000 awarded to the Plaintiff. The 2nd Defendant shall therefore pay to the Plaintiff the sum of $122,000. When oral grounds were delivered on 20 November 2019, counsel for the Plaintiff requested for the court to fix costs. After hearing from both parties on the issue of costs, costs was fixed at $14,000 and disbursements was fixed at $2440.60.
