### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

## Introduction

The Accused is a 45-year-old male. The Prosecution proceeded with six charges (referred to in this judgment as the “Proceeded Charges”) against him, comprising:

(a)     five charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act[^1] (“MDA”); and

(b)     one charge under the Penal Code.[^2]

2       I sentenced the Accused for the six Proceeded Charges as follows:

4       The commencement of the global imprisonment term of 12 years was backdated to the point when the Accused was first remanded, i.e. 9 March 2018.

## Facts

5       The Accused committed the offences underlying the 1st and 2nd Proceeded Charges (trafficking in, and consumption of, methamphetamine) in December 2016.

6       After being released on bail for these two charges, he went on to commit:

(a)     the offence underlying the 3rd Proceeded Charge (use of criminal force) in August 2017; and

(b)     the offences underlying the 4th to 6th Proceeded Charges (possession of diamorphine, consumption of morphine and possession of methamphetamine) in March 2018.

7       The following facts are distilled from the amended Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution, which the Accused admitted to.

#### 1st and 2nd Proceeded Charges

8       On the evening of 14 December 2016, the Accused (who was unemployed at the time) was arrested for drug offences. He was escorted to police headquarters, where a search on him yielded some packets of crystalline substance. On 16 December 2016 at about 1.55am, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) searched the Accused’s residence, where they found 1 packet of crystalline substance (marked as Exhibit HBJ-A1A1) in the refrigerator.

9       These events provide the context for the 1st and 2nd Proceeded Charges:

(a)     1st Proceeded Charge (**DAC 948675/2016**) −Trafficking not less than 17.84 grams of methamphetamine:

Analysis by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) Illicit Drugs Laboratory revealed that Exhibit HBJ-A1A1 contained not less than _17.84 grams of Methamphetamine_.[^5] The Accused admitted to owning Exhibit HBJ-A1A1 and said that it was intended for sale to others and also for his own consumption.

(b)     2nd Proceeded Charge (**DAC 948676/2016**) −Consumption of methamphetamine:

Following his arrest, the Accused’s urine samples were analysed by HSA’s Analytical Toxicology Laboratory and found to contain methamphetamine.[^6] The Accused admitted that on the afternoon of his arrest, he had smoked ‘Ice’ (the street name for methamphetamine) by pouring some of it into a glass utensil, heating the utensil with a lighter and inhaling the fumes.

10     The Accused was charged in court for the above offences and released on court bail.

#### 3rd Proceeded Charge (offence committed while on bail)

11     On 15 August 2017, the Accused was at a coffee shop when he spotted the victim, who was a 13-year old student. Thinking that the victim had stolen a phone belonging to a son of the Accused’s friend, the Accused confronted the victim. When the victim denied stealing the phone, the Accused grew angry and pushed the victim on the neck, before trying to kick him. The Accused had to be pulled away by passers-by before the confrontation ceased. This formed the subject of the 3rd Proceeded Charge (**MAC 908987/201**) −use of criminal force.

#### 4th to 6th Proceeded Charges (offences committed while on bail)

12     On the evening of 7 March 2018, at about 9.30pm, the Accused purchased a packet of brown granular substance (marked as Exhibit D1A1) from a third party, using S$2,400 that the Accused obtained from his wife. About 10 minutes after that, the Accused was arrested by CNB officers at an overhead bridge, during which he put up a violent struggle. The CNB officers found (_inter alia_) Exhibit D1A1 in a bag next to the Accused, who was then brought back to CNB Central Division for investigations. The CNB officers also proceeded to the Accused’s residence, only to find that the Accused’s wife refused to open the door. The CNB officers effected forced entry and searched the residence, where they found (_inter alia_) a packet of crystalline substance (marked as Exhibit E1B). The Accused’s wife was also arrested.

13     These events provide the backdrop to the 4th to 6th Proceeded Charges, which are set out below:

(a)     4th Proceeded Charge (**DAC 926864/2018**) −Trafficking not less than 7.17 grams of diamorphine:

Exhibit D1A1 was analysed by HSA’s Illicit Drugs Laboratory and found to contain not less than _7.17 grams of diamorphine_.[^7] The Accused admitted to ownership and possession of Exhibit D1A1, which he said contained ‘Panas’ (a street name for diamorphine). The Accused said that he intended to repack Exhibit D1A1 into 60 packets, of which he intended to pass 30 packets to his wife for her trafficking activities and also for her own consumption. He intended to keep the remaining 30 packets for himself, of which:

(i)       23-24 packets were meant for selling; and

(ii)       6-7 packets were for the Accused’s own consumption.

(b)     5th Proceeded Charge (**DAC 926866/2018**) −Consumption of morphine:

After his arrest, the Accused’s urine samples were analysed by HSA’s Analytical Toxicology Laboratory and found to contain morphine.[^8] The Accused admitted that he had smoked diamorphine in his bedroom, prior to his arrest. He did so by pouring some diamorphine on an aluminium foil, heating the underside of the foil and inhaling the fumes. The Accused admitted that since 2014, he smoked diamorphine a few times a day.

(c)     6th Proceeded Charge (**DAC 934347/2018**) −Joint possession (by the Accused and his wife) of not less than 0.22 grams of methamphetamine:

As regards Exhibit E1B, analysis by HSA’s Illicit Drugs Laboratory found this to contain not less than _0.22 grams of methamphetamine_.[^9] The Accused admitted to ownership and possession of Exhibit E1B, which he knew contained Ice. He also admitted that the Ice was for consumption by him and his wife.

14     The Accused had, in May 1996, been convicted under s.8(a) MDA for unauthorised possession of a controlled drug (for which he was sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment).[^10] As this past conviction has not been set aside, the Accused’s current conviction for drug possession (under DAC 934347/2018) constitutes a subsequent offence that attracts enhanced punishment, i.e. a minimum imprisonment term of 2 years.[^11]

## Antecedents

15     Apart from the Accused’s previous conviction for unauthorised drug possession, he also had a list of property-related offences stretching between 1990 and 1998 (e.g. theft simpliciter,[^12] theft in dwelling[^13] and theft of motor vehicle or any component thereof[^14]).

## Mitigation

16     The Accused tendered a short written mitigation[^15] in which he explained that he was the sole breadwinner who had to cope with the family’s expenses and housing loan. Under the stress of his financial issues, he made the grave mistake of thinking that a shortcut was the solution.

## Sentence

#### Parties’ submissions

17     The Prosecution proposed that the following sentences be imposed in respect of the six Proceeded Charges:

18     As for the Accused, he asked for the minimum global sentence.

#### The 2nd & 5th Proceeded Charges (drug consumption)

19     As regards the charges for consumption of methamphetamine (under the 2nd Proceeded Charge) and morphine (under the 5th Proceeded Charge), the Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of no less than 12 months each.

20     A key sentencing consideration for drug offences is deterrence (both general and specific), given the grave harm that drugs cause to both individuals and society at large: see _Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ \[2017\] SGHC 183.[^17] For drug consumption charges, a custodial term is warranted unless it is a purely exceptional case: see _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor_ \[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1[^18] (“_Dinesh_”). In _Dinesh_, the accused person pleaded guilty to and was sentenced under s.8(b) MDA for unauthorised consumption of cocaine. On appeal, his sentence was reduced (from 12 months’ imprisonment) to 8 months’ imprisonment. The High Court, in describing[^19] the accused person’s conduct as a “single foolish act of momentary indiscretion”, laid out its sentencing considerations:[^20]

I take into account the following considerations: that the Appellant did not seek the drugs; that the act of consumption was not planned but effected on the spur of the moment; that the amount consumed was not substantial; that there was no payment involved in this unfortunate incident and that this was, based on the evidence before the court, a one-off episode.

21     The complexion of that case was very different from the facts underlying the 2nd and 5th Proceeded Charges. The Accused was no stranger to drugs. Despite his previous conviction in 1996, he persisted with his consumption habit. Apart from the two Proceeded Charges for drug consumption, there was yet a further drug consumption charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.[^21] On these facts, the sentence for the 2nd Proceeded Charge should be calibrated to an **_imprisonment term of 12 months_**.

22     As for the 5th Proceeded Charge, I similarly imposed an **_imprisonment term of 12 months_**. However, this sentence could have been higher given that the offence underlying the 5th Proceeded Charge was committed whilst the Accused was on bail (the rationale for imposing higher sentences for offences committed while on bail is alluded to at paragraph 28 below). As such, the sentence for the 5th Proceeded Charge ought, on principle, to have incorporated an uplift over that imposed for the 2nd Proceeded Charge. Nevertheless, the absence of such an uplift did not impact the global sentence, as I was minded to order that the imprisonment term for the 5th Proceeded Charge run concurrently with the other sentences.

#### The 1st & 4th Proceeded Charges (drug trafficking)

23     I move on to the two trafficking charges, i.e. the 1st and 4th Proceeded Charges. The latter charge accounted for the lion’s share of the global sentence which the Accused ultimately received.

24     For drug trafficking cases, the quantity of drugs trafficked is a strong determinant of the appropriate sentence, given its direct correlation with the degree of harm, although quantity is of course not the only consideration: see _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ \[2015\] SGHC 197[^22] (“_Vasentha_”). Indicative sentencing bands have been set out in case law:

(a)     For diamorphine, the cases of _Vasentha_ and _Public Prosecutor v Lai Teck Guan_ \[2018\] SGHC 151 set out the indicative starting sentences for, respectively, first-time and repeat traffickers. The sentencing bands set out in both these cases were further modified in _Soh Qiu Xia Katty v Public Prosecutor_ \[2018\] SGHC 260 (“_Katty Soh_”).

(b)     For methamphetamine, the case of _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v Public Prosecutor_ \[2015\] SGHC 217 (_Loo Pei Xiang Alan_) adapted the _Vasentha_ sentencing bands to the methamphetamine context.

25     I now deal with the 4th Proceeded Charge, i.e. trafficking in not less than 7.17 grams of diamorphine.

26     Based on guidance from the case law cited above, the starting sentence (before adjusting for other factors) for trafficking between 7−8 grams of diamorphine is between 8 to 9 years’ imprisonment (plus 8 strokes of the cane). Given that the 4th charge only involved 7.17 grams of heroin, which sits close to the lower end of the 7−8 grams range, the starting imprisonment term for the 4th Proceeded Charge should similarly sit at the lower end of the 8−9 year band, i.e. closer to 8 years.

27     Given this starting point, I thought that a jump to 10−11 years, as sought by the Prosecution, was rather steep. I also observe that based on the Statement of Facts, a very small fraction of the diamorphine that was the subject of the 4th Proceeded Charge was purportedly for the Accused’s own consumption (see paragraph 13(a) above), so the actual amount meant to be trafficked may have been slightly _lower_ than 7.17 grams. During the hearing before me,[^23] the Prosecution explained that it was particularly aggravating for the Accused to have committed the offence in the 4th Proceeded Charge while on bail.

28     The Prosecution is undoubtedly correct that commission of the offence while on bail is an aggravating factor. In _Loo Pei Xiang Alan_, Chao Hick Tin JA (as he then was) remarked that if an accused person commits the drug offence while on bail, this is a good reason to elevate the sentence above the indicative starting point, given that such conduct[^24]

demonstrates a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention.

Still, at the very next line in that judgment, Chao JA cautioned that this alone should not justify an overly sharp increase:

But I do not think that this factor alone warrants a sharp increase of six years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane from the minimum. I am therefore of the opinion that, for the trafficking charge, the sentence of 16 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane imposed on the appellant by the District Judge was manifestly excessive.

His Honour had then proceeded to add an uplift of 2 years’ imprisonment to the indicative starting sentence of 10 years.

29     Bearing in mind that the indicative starting imprisonment term for the 4th Proceeded Charge was 8 years, I decided that dialling this up by one year, i.e. to 9 years’ imprisonment, was sufficient to reflect the court’s disapprobation of the Accused’s conduct in committing the offence while out on bail. As for the caning component, I saw no reason to deviate from the starting point of 8 strokes. In particular, I found the Accused’s plea in mitigation, i.e. that he had committed the offences as a shortcut for alleviating his financial stresses, to be devoid of merit. I thus imposed a sentence of **_9 years’ imprisonment (plus 8 strokes of the cane)_** for the 4th Proceeded Charge.

30     I now move on to the 1st Proceeded Charge, i.e. trafficking in not less than 17.84 grams of methamphetamine.

31     Based on _Loo Pei Xiang Alan_,[^25] the culpability of someone trafficking one gram of diamorphine is equivalent to that of an identically-situated offender trafficking 16.7 grams of methamphetamine. This means that the 1st Proceeded Charge, which involved trafficking in 17.84 grams of methamphetamine, entailed roughly the same level of culpability as an identically-situated offender trafficking in 1.07 grams[^26] of diamorphine. This in turn maps to a starting point (under the indicative sentencing bands laid out in _Katty Soh_) of about 5 years and 4-8 months’ imprisonment (plus 5 strokes of the cane).

32     During the first mention before me,[^27] the Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of 8 years for the 1st Proceeded Charge. I had remarked that this was a sizeable leap from the indicative starting point of 5 years plus. At the subsequent mention,[^28] the Prosecution revised its position downwards and sought an imprisonment term of 5 years & 8 months. I am of the view that on the current facts, there are no significant aggravating or mitigating factors underlying the 1st Proceeded Charge to justify moving the imprisonment term outside of the indicative starting band (as set out in _Katty Soh_) of 5 years and 4-8 months’ imprisonment. Within this four-month spread, the imprisonment term should be at the higher end, taking into account that there was one other TiC charge for trafficking in methamphetamine.[^29] As regards the caning component, I saw no reason to deviate from the starting point of 5 strokes. I thus imposed a sentence of **_5 years and 8 months’ imprisonment (plus 5 strokes of the cane)_** for the 1st Proceeded Charge.

#### The 6th Proceeded Charge (drug possession)

33     As alluded to above, the Accused has a prior conviction (in May 1996) for unauthorised possession of a controlled drug under s.8(a) MDA. Despite the fact that this was more than 20 years ago, it still calls the principle of specific deterrence into play.

34     Notwithstanding this, the Accused is already being penalised for his recalcitrance (in respect of drug possession) by the triggering of the enhanced punishment regime. Specifically, given that the conviction under the 6th Proceeded Charge constitutes a subsequent offence under s.8(a) MDA, it attracts a minimum imprisonment term of 2 years. This significantly exceeds the 3-week imprisonment term for his previous conviction for drug possession and I saw no reason to go beyond that.

35     I thus imposed **_2 years’ imprisonment_** for the 6th Proceeded Charge.

#### The 3rd Proceeded Charge (use of criminal force)

36     The precedents for an offence of this nature show that the sentences typically range from a fine to a short custodial sentence. Given that the Accused’s conviction for the other offences already attract a significant imprisonment term, I decided to impose a short **_imprisonment term of 2 weeks_** for the 3rd Proceeded Charge and have it run concurrently with the other sentences.

## Conclusion

37     Having imposed the individual sentences above, I ordered the imprisonment terms for the 2nd, 4th and 6th Proceeded Charges to run consecutively, giving rise to a global sentence of **_12 years’ imprisonment and 13 strokes_** of the cane.

38     Taking a “last look”[^30] at this global sentence, I did not find it to offend the totality principle:

(a)     The most serious of the individual sentences would be that for the 4th Proceeded Charge. As explained above, the normal imprisonment term for that offence, given the amount of diamorphine involved, would be up to 9 years. Juxtaposed against that, the global imprisonment term of 13 years does not appear disproportionately high, particularly considering the number of offences involved and the lack of any noteworthy mitigating factors.

(b)     Furthermore, the global imprisonment term of 13 years was neither crushing, nor did it fail to keep with the Accused’s past record and future prospects. With remission for good behaviour, the Accused could conceivably be released in 8 years and a few months. This was not so long as to “induce a feeling of hopelessness that destroys all prospects of the \[the Accused’s\] subsequent rehabilitation and reintegration.”[^31]

39     I was thus not minded to opt for a different combination of consecutive sentences that might have yielded a lower global imprisonment term.
