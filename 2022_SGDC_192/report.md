### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       Criminally minded individuals find various ways to breach and exploit our immigration controls and laws so that they can enter, stay, and work in Singapore. Some smuggle themselves into Singapore. Others produce false documents to our immigration authorities. And there are some who take the drastic step of entering into marriages of convenience to deceive the immigration authorities into granting them immigration advantages.

2       Section 57C(1) of the Immigration Act 1959 (“**Immigration Act**”) criminalises the act of entering into a marriage of convenience to obtain an immigration advantage (“**s 57C(1) offence**”). Although s 57C(1) came into force a decade ago, some sentencing issues for the offence remain to be considered. For instance, while there are clear sentencing norms for a s 57C(1) offence, there is a dearth of jurisprudence on its offence-specific sentencing factors. Importantly, it appears that courts have thus far not considered whether the value of a gratification received by an offender in the commission of a s 57C(1) offence is relevant to his sentencing, and if so, how?

3       The present case provides an opportunity to consider the above issues. Before doing so, it would be useful to set out the facts of the case.

## Background facts

### The charges

4       The accused person, Lim Yung Keng Adam (“**the Accused**”), pleaded guilty before me to the following charges:

> (a)     A charge under s 57C(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed) for having entered into a marriage of convenience on 15 July 2019 with one Du Yuju (“**Du**”), a People’s Republic of China national, so as to assist Du to obtain a visit pass. The Accused received $18,000 from Du as a reward for entering into the marriage. (“**1st Charge**”)

> (b)     A charge under s 57(1)(k) read with s 57(1)(vi) of the Immigration Act for having submitted to the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (“**ICA**”) on 15 October 2019 a visit pass application form for Du in his capacity as her husband and a sponsor. When submitting the form, the Accused had declared that various statements made by Du in the form were true and correct, when he knew that this was not the case. As a result of the application, ICA issued a short-term visit pass to Du. (“**2nd Charge**”)

> (c)     A charge under s 57(1)(k) read with s 57(1)(vi) of the Immigration Act for having submitted to ICA on 16 September 2020 a long-term visit pass application form for Du in his capacity as her husband and a sponsor. When submitting the form, the Accused had declared that various statements made by Du and he in the form were true and correct, when he knew that this was not the case. As a result of the application, ICA issued a long-term visit pass to Du. (“**3rd Charge**”)

### The facts

5       The circumstances of the 1st Charge are as follows:

> (a)     In 2019, the Accused, a Singapore citizen, approached X for financial assistance. X suggested to the Accused that he enter into a marriage of convenience in return for money from his prospective “wife”. After the Accused agreed with the suggestion, X put the Accused in contact with Du. The Accused first met Du at the airport when she was leaving for Penang after her work permit had been cancelled. He later met Du again in Penang to discuss about their marriage plans in detail.

> (b)     The Accused knew that Du had wanted to remain in Singapore to work to support her brother and niece who were ill in China, and that she had also planned to bring her daughter from Penang into Singapore and enrol her in a school here. In return for $18,000, the Accused agreed to enter into marriage of convenience with Du and to assist her with her visit pass applications to remain in Singapore after the marriage.

> (c)     After returning to Singapore, the Accused filed notice of his intended marriage with Du at the Registry of Marriages (“**ROM**”). Du later arrived in Singapore for the marriage solemnization which took place on 15 July 2019 at a restaurant. After the solemnization, the Accused and Du stayed apart. Du worked as a freelance KTC hostess and made various payments to the Accused totalling $18,000.

6       The facts relating to the 2nd Charge are as follows. On 15 October 2019, at ICA Building, the Accused submitted an application for a short-term visit pass for Du. He falsely declared in the form that (i) Du was residing at his address while in Singapore, and (ii) the purpose of Du’s visit to Singapore was to stay with him (her “husband”). Not knowing that the application form contained false declarations, ICA issued a short-term visit pass to Du.

7       The offence in the 3rd Charge was committed in the following circumstances:

> (a)     On 16 September 2020, at ICA Building, the Accused submitted an application for a long-term visit pass for Du. The application form contained various false declarations by the Accused that he did not enter into a marriage of convenience with Du. Not knowing that the application form contained false declarations, ICA issued a long-term visit pass to Du.

> (b)     From September 2020 till August 2021, the Accused received $400/month as a reward from Du for assisting her to obtain the long-term visit pass. These payments (totalling $4,800) stopped when the Accused and Du were arrested in September 2021.

### Charges taken into consideration

8       Apart from the above three charges, the Accused faced another six similar charges under s 57(1)(k) read with s 57(1)(vi) of the Immigration Act. He consented to them being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

### Antecedents

9       In 2015, the Accused was convicted was convicted of charges under the Moneylending Act. He was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment and $60,000 in total.

### Mitigation

10     In mitigation, the Defence raised the following key points:

> (a)     The Accused is single, had been unemployed since 2021, and was supporting his aged mother. He committed the offences because of financial difficulties.

> (b)     The Accused’s offences did not contain any aggravating factor.

> (c)     The Accused had rendered his fullest cooperation to the immigration authorities, admitted to his wrongdoing in his cautioned statements, and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.

### Du’s sentences

11     Du faced charges that were similar to the Accused’s. She pleaded guilty to her charges and her sentences were as follows:

13     Having set out the background facts, I will now proceed to the sentencing issues raised in the present case and the parties’ positions on these issues.

## Section 57C(1) of the Immigration Act

### Prescribed punishment

14     Section 57C(1) and (2) states the following:

> **57C.**—(1)    Any person who contracts or otherwise enters into a marriage —

>> (a)    knowing or having reason to believe that the purpose of the marriage is to assist one of the parties to the marriage to obtain an immigration advantage; and

>> (b)    where any gratification, whether from a party to the marriage or another person, is offered, given or received as an inducement or reward to any party to the marriage for entering into the marriage,

> shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both.

> (2)    Any person who arranges or otherwise assists in arranging a marriage between 2 other persons, with the intention of assisting one of the parties to the marriage to obtain an immigration advantage, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both.

### The sentencing issues and the parties’ submissions

15     During the proceedings, I sought the assistance of the Prosecution and the Defence to clarify several sentencing issues.

#### Is the value of gratification relevant to sentencing?

16     The first concerns _whether_ the value of the gratification received by the Accused is relevant to his sentencing. I had posed this issue to the parties in the following terms:

> **Issue A.** If an accused person had received gratification in the commission of an offence under s 57C(1) of the Act, is this relevant to his sentencing as a matter of principle?

> For instance, all other things being equal –

>> (1)    Should two accused persons – one who had received $10,000 as gratification for entering into a marriage of convenience and another who had received $2,000 as gratification – receive the same sentence?

>> (2)    Should two parties to a marriage of convenience receive the same sentence when one of them had provided gratification to the other?

17     The Prosecution’s position on Issue A is as follows:

> (a)     The value of the gratification received by an offender _is relevant_ to his sentencing. This is because the value is indicative of his level of greed and thus his level of culpability. The value of the gratification received should be considered alongside other factors and should not be determinative on the sentence to be imposed.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

> (b)     In general, the giver and recipient of a gratification should receive the same sentence as they (i) had entered into the same marriage of convenience, (ii) would have performed similar roles in the commission of the offence, and (iii) would each have received _quid pro quo_ benefits out of the marriage – these benefits being in the form of the gratification (for the local offender) and the immigration advantage (for the foreign offender).

> (c)     The sentences for the giver and recipient of a gratification can be different where there is a difference in their individual level of culpability – e.g., where one of them had been exploited by the other into committing the s 57C(1) offence.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

18     The Defence took a different position on Issue A. According to them, the value of the gratification received by an offender _is irrelevant_ to his sentencing. This is because s 57C(1) did not expressly require a court to consider this as a sentencing factor. Accordingly –

> (a)     Two offenders who each received different amounts of monies as gratification should receive the same sentence.

> (b)     There should not be a distinction in the sentences for the giver and recipient of the gratification.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

#### How does the gratification affect sentencing?

19     If the gratification received by an offender is a relevant sentencing factor, then the next issue is _how_ this should feature in his sentencing. This issue was posed to the parties as follows:

> **Issue B**: If Issue A is answered in the affirmative, then how should the fact that an accused person had received a gratification be factored into his sentence?

> For instance –

>> (1)    Should the accused person’s sentence include a fine component to disgorge the gratification that he had received?

>> (2)    If the answer to Issue B(1) is yes, then how should an accused person be sentenced if his gratification is higher than the maximum prescribed fine under s 57C of the Act?

>> (3)    Alternatively, in lieu of a fine component to disgorge the gratification, should there be an uplift in the accused person’s term of imprisonment to account for this gratification? If the answer is yes, then how should this uplift be computed?

20     The Prosecution’s position on Issue B is as follows:[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

> (a)     In line with established sentencing jurisprudence and the need to deter the commission of s 57C(1) offences, _a fine – in addition to imprisonment –_ should be imposed to strip an offender of his illicit gains (“**disgorgement fine**”).

> (b)     The imposition of a disgorgement fine on the recipient of a gratification – but not on the giver – would not be unfair to the former. This is because a disgorgement fine is not an additional punishment.

> (c)     Where the value of the gratification exceeds the maximum prescribed fine, then the maximum fine should be imposed. There should not be an uplift in the offender’s imprisonment term simply to account for the shortfall between the value of the gratification and disgorgement fine.

21     The Defence submitted that disgorgement fines should not be imposed on the recipients of gratifications under s 57C(1). I will elaborate on the Defence’s reasons for this position later in this decision: see \[54\] below.

##### _Does_ Mehra Radhika _shed any light on Issues A and B?_

22     Section 57C(2) criminalises the act of _arranging or assisting in arranging_ a marriage of convenience (“**s 57C(2) offence**”). In _Mehra Radhika v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 96</span> (“**_Mehra Radhika_**”), the High Court discussed the sentencing approach for a s 57C(2) offence. Given the similarities between a s 57C(2) offence and a s 57C(1) offence, I posed the following questions to the parties:

> **Issue C**:

>> (1)    Does the decision in _Mehra Radhika v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 96</span> (“**_Mehra Radhika_**”) shed any light on the above issues?

>> (2)    In _Mehra Radhika_, it is stated that the co-accused person (Peer Ali) was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment. What are the sentencing factors for Peer Ali? Did he plead guilty?

23     The Prosecution’s position on Issue C is as follows:[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

> (a)     The following normative principles articulated in _Mehra Radhika_ are relevant to the sentencing of a s 57C(1) offence:

>> (i)       An offender is more culpable if he is motivated by financial reward (gratification) to enter into a marriage of convenience. This enhanced culpability can be addressed by imposing a disgorgement fine on the offender.

>> (iii)       In appropriate cases, a lower sentence can be imposed where the gratification is non-monetary in nature.

> (b)     While _Mehra Radhika_ is instructive, care must be taken to avoid conflating the sentencing considerations for a s 57C(1) offence and a s 57C(2) offence. This is because these offences are different and the range of factual situations that can fall within s 57C(2) is wider than s 57C(1). For instance –

>> (i)       Unlike s 57C(1), the giving/offer of a gratification is not an offence element for s 57C(2).

>> (ii)       An offender can enter into a marriage of convenience and thus commit a s 57C(1) offence only once (until the marriage had ended). There is however no limit to the number of times an offender can commit a s 57C(2) offence.

>> (iii)       The factual situations that can constitute an act of arranging or assisting in the arrangement of a marriage of convenience under s 57C(2) are wider than that of entering into or contracting a marriage of convenience under s 57C(1).

> (c)     The Prosecution was unable to provide any information regarding the sentencing of Peer Ali.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

24     The Defence submitted that _Mehra Radhika_ did not provide any assistance in the sentencing of a s 57C(1) offence. This is because –

> (a)      _Mehra Radhika_ involved a different offence where gratification is not an offence element, and

> (b)     An offender convicted under s 57C(2) is more culpable than one convicted under s 57C(1).[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

#### Do the precedents for s 57C(1) provide any guidance?

25     Finally, I posed the following question to the parties:

> **Issue D:**

>> (1)    Have the reported cases set out a clear sentencing norm for an offence under s 57C(1) of the Act?

>> (2)    Have these cases addressed Issue A and Issue B?

>> (3)    What should be the sentencing norm for the offence under s 57C(1) of the Act?

26     The Prosecution made the following submissions based on reported and unreported cases from the State Courts on s 57C(1):

> (a)     A benchmark sentencing approach had been adopted for s 57C(1) offences.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

>> (i)       For first-time offenders who pleaded guilty – Six months’ imprisonment had been imposed.

>> (ii)       For offenders who claimed trial – Eight months’ imprisonment had been imposed.

> (b)     There is no reported decision where a disgorgement fine had been imposed. While some judges have referred to the value of the gratification received in sentencing, no uplift in the sentence eventually imposed had been justified on that basis.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

> (c)      _Mehra Radhika_ had been cited as providing general guidance for sentencing a s 57C(1) offence, but not in relation to the imposition of disgorgement fines for such an offence.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

27     The Defence’s submissions are largely similar to the Prosecution’s. Based on the State Courts precedents on s 57C(1), the Defence observed the following:

> (a)     The value of the gratification received by an offender had not been considered in determining his imprisonment term.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

> (b)     The givers and recipients of gratification had received the same sentences.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

> (c)     Disgorgement fines had not been imposed.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

### Applicable principles

28     I will now set out my observations on the applicable principles for sentencing a s 57C(1) offence.

#### Clear and well-established sentencing norms

29     I agree with the parties that there are clear and well-established sentencing norms at the State Courts for a s 57C(1) offence: see \[26\] above. These norms have been stated in several decisions: see e.g., _Public Prosecutor v Goh Teck Kwee and Lu Meiyi_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 251</span> (“**_Goh Teck Kwee_**”) at \[108\]; _Public Prosecutor v Syed Adumai Shariff and Amarawathy d/o Karuppanan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 273</span> at \[48\] (“**_Syed Adumai Shariff_**”); _Public Prosecutor v Qin Fuxing_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 154</span> (“**_Qin Fuxing_**”) at \[71\].

30     The sentencing norms for a s 57C(1) offence involve a significant term of imprisonment. Such deterrent sentences are necessary:

> (a)     Within the scheme of the Immigration Act, s 57C offences are one of the most serious judging by the fact that such offences attract a maximum punishment of 10 years’ imprisonment. This is the highest punishment prescribed in the Immigration Act – no other offence in the Act attracts such a punishment.

> (b)     The high prescribed punishment in s 57C reflects the seriousness of the offence. Marriages of convenience (i) undermine our immigration and economic policies, (ii) sap our social and public services, (iii) are difficult to detect, and (iv) involve a deception on the authorities (e.g., ICA and ROM).

31     Neither the Prosecution nor the Defence challenged the appropriateness of the State Courts’ sentencing norms for a s 57C(1) offence.

#### Archetypal case where the sentencing norms had been applied

32     Based on my survey of the reported and unreported sentencing precedents for s 57C(1), cases where the sentencing norms had been applied typically have the following profile:

> (a)     The foreign offender is female while the local offender is male. (In my view, the sex of the local and foreign offenders _per se_ should not affect sentencing.)

> (b)     The local offender _knew_ – as opposed to merely having reason to believe – that the purpose of the marriage was to assist the foreign offender to obtain an immigration advantage.

> (c)     Both the local and foreign offenders were charged for _having entered_ – as opposed to merely having contracted to enter – into a marriage of convenience in Singapore.

> (d)     The local offender and/or and foreign offender had taken _some_ steps to deceive the authorities into believing that their marriage was not a sham: see \[63\] below for further discussion.

> (e)     The gratification was _monetary_ in nature. This is despite the fact that s 57C(6) has a wide definition of what can qualify as “gratification” for the purpose of a s 57C(1) offence.

#### Sentencing issues relating s 57C(1) offence

33     While there are clear and well-established sentencing norms for s 57C(1) offence, some sentencing issues remain.

> (a)     Even though s 57C(1) provides for up to 10 years’ imprisonment and up to $10,000 in fine, courts have seldom departed from the sentencing norms. In this regard –

>> (i)       Sentences tend to concentrate within a very narrow range of between five to eight months’ imprisonment.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

>> (ii)       Except in one unreported case (_Public Prosecutor v Mohamad Faisal bin Osman_ (SC-904447-2016)), courts have not imposed sentences of a _fine in addition to_ imprisonment.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

> (b)     There is a dearth of discussion in the reported cases on what are the offence-specific sentencing factors for a s 57C(1) offence (i.e., factors relating to s 57C(1) itself that can affect the gravity of the offence), and how these factors affect the application of the sentencing norms for the offence.

34     In my view, it is important to understand what the offence-specific sentencing factors are for a s 57C(1) offence. This will ensure (a) an informed application of the sentencing norms and (b) that the sentence imposed fits the offence and meets the objectives of punishment.

#### Mehra Radhika

35     In this regard, I agree with the Prosecution that _Mehra Radhika –_ which had discussed the offence-specific sentencing factors for a s 57C(2) offence – can shed some light on the applicable factors for a s 57C(1) offence as well. The mischief sought to be addressed by both s 57C(1) and s 57C(2) is the same – marriages of convenience. This objective is achieved in s 57C(1) by criminalising the act of entering into a marriage of convenience, and in s 57C(2) by criminalising the act of arranging or assisting in arranging such a marriage. Given that s 57C(1) and s 57C(2) seek to address the same mischief, it is reasonable to expect that offences under these provisions will share some common offence-specific sentencing factors.

36     That said, I am mindful, as both the Prosecution and Defence had pointed out, that the elements for a s 57C(1) offence and a s 57C(2) offence are different and that care ought to be taken when applying the offence-specific sentencing factors in _Mehra Radhika_ to a s 57C(1) offence.

37     Before turning to discuss the offence-specific sentencing factors for s 57C(1), I wish to comment on the Defence’s submission that an person who commits a s 57C(2) offence is more culpable than one who commits a s 57C(1) offence. I disagree with this sweeping submission.

> (a)     First, one can reasonably take the view that a person who enters into a marriage of convenience is in fact more culpable than one who merely arranges or assists in arranging such a marriage. This is because a person who enters into a marriage of convenience has taken concrete steps to deceive the authorities.

> (b)     In any event, sentencing is a highly fact-specific exercise and that it is not difficult to envisage situations where a person who enters into a marriage of convenience is more culpable than one who merely arranges such a marriage. _Mehra Radhika_ is a case on point. In that case, the offender had pleaded guilty to a s 57C(2) offence for having arranged a marriage of convenience between G (an Indian national) and N (a female Singapore national). In reducing the offender’s sentence to six months’ imprisonment, the High Court found that the offender had committed the offence simply to facilitate her brother’s desire to help a friend. The High Court pointed out that the offender’s mode of arrangement was “basic” – first, she had approached one Peer Ali, who subsequently located N as the “wife” for G; second, the offender brought G to the solemnisation venue. The High Court further noted that the offender did not obtain any gratification for making the arrangements – unlike Peer Ali who had reaped a profit of $6,300 for his role in arranging the marriage of convenience and was thus more culpable. It bears noting that Peer Ali was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment. In terms of culpability, a person who had received a monetary gratification and committed a s 57C(1) offence is clearly closer to Peer Ali’s than the offender’s in _Mehra Radhika_.

> (c)     Finally, it bears noting that Parliament did not make a distinction between the gravity of the offences in s 57C(1) and s 57C(2). For both offences, Parliament had prescribed the _same_ punishment.

#### Offence-specific sentencing factors for s 57C(1)

38     In my view, the offence-specific sentencing factors for a s 57C(1) offence includes the following:

> (a)     Whether marriage of convenience had been entered into

> (b)     Nature of the offender’s guilty mind

> (c)     Reason for the offence – Was there exploitation?

> (d)     Whether significant steps taken to evade detection

> (e)     Nature and value of the gratification

39     I will now elaborate on each of these factors.

##### Whether marriage of convenience had been entered into

40     Section 57C(1) involves two types of _actus reus_:

> (a)     The first involves the act of _entering into_ a marriage of convenience.

> (b)     The second involves the act of _contracting_ – i.e., to _formally agreeing_ – to enter into such a marriage: see definition of “contract” in the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary (online). Under this second scenario, there is no need for the offender to have actually married the other party.

41     Between the two types of _actus reus_, the first is clearly more culpable.

> (a)     First, an offender who has entered into a marriage of convenience will have shown by such conduct that he is committed to abusing our immigration policies. This is because to enter into a marriage in Singapore, a person must, among others, go through the process of filing a notice of marriage with the ROM, making a statutory declaration at the ROM and solemnising the marriage. It is only after these steps have been taken that a marriage will be legally recognised in Singapore.

> (b)     Furthermore, by going through the various processes at the ROM so as to enter into a marriage of convenience, an offender would have deceived the authorities into believing that the marriage was for the purpose of entering into a genuine marital relationship. There would not have been such a deception where there is only an agreement to enter into such a marriage.

> (c)     Finally, a foreign offender who has entered into a marriage of convenience will be able to use her marital status to apply to ICA to obtain the immigration advantage. This would not be possible where the parties have merely agreed to marry each other.

42     The sentencing norms stated at \[26\] above for a s 57C(1) offence typically involve offenders who _had already entered into_ a marriage of convenience. Accordingly, if an offender is convicted of _merely having contracted/agreed to enter into_ such a marriage (which is of lower culpability), a lower sentence may be appropriate.

43     Finally, it bears noting that s 57C(1) does not just criminalise marriages of convenience entered into in Singapore. Marriages entered into outside of Singapore are also caught: see s 57C(3). In my view, marriages of convenience entered into outside of Singapore are more difficult to detect. Offenders who enter into a marriage of convenience outside of Singapore – so as to minimise the risk of the authorities finding out that their marriage is a sham – ought to be punished more severely.

##### Nature of offender’s guilty mind

44     To commit a s 57C(1) offence, a local offender must enter into a marriage of convenience with one of two states of mind – i.e., either “_knowing or having reason to believe_ that the purpose of the marriage is to assist one of the parties to the marriage to obtain an immigration advantage”.

45     It is well-established that an offender who commits a criminal act knowing the existence of the relevant facts is _more culpable_ than one who only has reason to believe the existence of such facts: see e.g., _Huang Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 606</span> at \[74\]; _Public Prosecutor v Tan Thian Earn_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 269</span> at \[17\] and \[47\].

46     Given that the sentencing norms apply to an offender who enters into a marriage of convenience knowing that its purpose is to assist the other party to obtain an immigration advantage, someone who commits a s 57C(1) offence with a less culpable guilty mind (having reason to believe) ought to receive a lower sentence.

##### Reason for the offence – Was there exploitation?

47     Parties to a marriage of convenience typically deal with each other at arms-length with each party trying to secure a benefit for himself/herself – whether that benefit is in the form of a monetary gratification (for the local offender) or an immigration advantage (for the foreign offender).

48     That said, there can be exceptions.

> (a)     It is not difficult to imagine cases where one party to a marriage of convenience may directly or indirectly prey on the vulnerability of the other party in the commission of a s 57C(1) offence.

>> (i)       An example is where one party persistently pressures the other party into entering a marriage of convenience with him/her so that he/she can secure a benefit for himself/herself.

>> (ii)       Another example is where a local offender abets a sex trafficking syndicate by entering into a marriage of convenience with a foreign offender so that the foreign offender can remain in Singapore to be exploited as a sex worker by the syndicate.

> If there is such pressure or exploitation, then this is clearly a culpability-enhancing factor and the offender ought to receive a sentence higher than the sentencing norms: _Mehra Radhika_ at \[25(d)\], \[56\] and \[64\].

> (b)     Conversely, if an offender commits a s 57C(1) offence due to pressure and exploitation, then this can be a mitigating factor.

>> (i)       One such example is _Public Prosecutor v Zhang Fengyu_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 121</span> (“**_Zhang Fengyu_**”). In that case, the court imposed three months’ imprisonment on a foreign offender who pleaded guilty to a s 57C(1) offence (i.e., a discount of three months from the sentencing norm). In imposing the sentence, the court considered, among others, the following factors: First, at the time of the offence, the foreign offender was staying in Singapore legally and did not need to enter into a marriage of convenience to obtain an immigration advantage. Second, the idea of entering into such a marriage was brought to the foreign offender by a third party who had played on her fears that she might be parted from her son (who was then residing in Singapore with her) when he turned 18. Third, the foreign offender received a persistent series of calls over six months which wore down her resistance to entering into the marriage. The court found that the foreign offender have been “carefully cajoled and baited into what, for the perpetrators, was an arrangement that reaped them a handsome profit of $18,000 plus $2,000 in an unpaid loan” and that the foreign offender “being freshly divorced and with substantial means, presented a plum target for exploitation by unscrupulous middlemen”: at \[32\] and \[33\].

>> (ii)       In _Zhang Fengyu_ at \[26\], the court gave two further examples – namely, _Public Prosecutor v Ng Hung Kwang_ (DAC 035897-2013) (“**_Ng Hung Kwang_**”) and _Public Prosecutor v Choo Jun Xiang Vinard_ (DAC 009080-2013) (“**_Choo Jun Xiang_**”) – where the offenders received a lower sentence because they had been exploited. In _Ng Hung Kwang_, the local offender who had entered into a marriage of convenience was found by IMH to be of borderline level of intelligence which rendered him suggestible and simplistic in thinking. Two months’ imprisonment was imposed. In _Choo Jun Xiang_, the local offender who had entered into a marriage of convenience was found to have a reduced intellectual capacity and was susceptible to manipulation by people. A sentence of four months and two weeks’ imprisonment was imposed.

##### Value of the gratification

49     The mere fact that an offender has received monetary gratification in the commission of a s 57C(1) offence is not an aggravating factor. This is because such an act is an element of the offence. To further treat the receipt of a gratification as an aggravating factor offends the rule against double counting: Kow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2019) (“**Sentencing Principles**”) at \[08.066\] – \[08.073\].

50     That said, there is a clear jurisprudence that where an offender has received illicit gains from his offence, a disgorgement fine should be imposed to “annul or negate any financial advantage that might have been obtained through the commission of the offence”: _Mehra Radhika_ at \[51\].

51     This jurisprudence is grounded in logic:

> (a)     The imposition of a disgorgement fine accords with the _deterrence principle_ – in that the greater the value of the illicit gains to be made by an offender, the greater his incentive to commit an offence, and hence the greater the need for a deterrent sentence: Sentencing Principles at \[08.074\] – \[08.075\].

> (b)     Imposing a disgorgement fine is also consistent with the _proportionality principle_ – an offender who receives a $10,000-gratification is clearly deserving of a higher sentence than one who receives a $1,000-gratification: see e.g., _Public Prosecutor v Cheng Yew Kwang and Chen Yanjie_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 272</span> (“**_Cheng Yew Kwang_**”) at \[124\] – \[128\]; _Public Prosecutor v Ong Jun Long_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 253</span> (“**_Ong Jun Long_**”) at \[21\] – \[26\].

> (c)     Disgorgement fine is a _fair and “smart” sentencing device_ – as the amount for disgorgement is calibrated precisely to the value of the illicit gains by the offender. There is no issue with over-sentencing or under-sentencing in its application.

52     The jurisprudence on disgorgement fines is well-established and can be found across different types of offences. See e.g., _Mehra Radhika_ at \[52\] (s 57C(2) offence); _Public Prosecutor v Su Jiqing Joel_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 3 SLR 1232</span> (“**_Joel Su_**”) at \[98\] (offence under the Planning Act); _Koo Kah Yee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 3 SLR 1440</span> at \[40\] (offence under the Remote Gambling Act); _Chiew Kok Chai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 713</span> (“**_Chiew Kok Chai_**”) at \[69\] (offence under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act); _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> (“**_Poh Boon Kiat_**”) at \[77\] and \[78\] (offences under the Women’s Charter); _Tan Gek Young v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 820</span> (“**_Tan Gek Young_**”) at \[75\] (offences under the Poisons Act and Medicines Act).

53     In the present case, the Accused had received a huge sum of $18,000 as gratification for entering into a marriage of convenience. In line with the clear and cogent jurisprudence discussed above, a disgorgement fine ought to be imposed in the present case.

54     Despite this, the Defence submitted that such a fine should not be imposed on the Accused. The Defence’s reasons for this submission are as follows:

> (a)     The Immigration Act does not contain a provision similar to s 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960 which requires a court to impose a penalty equivalent to the value of the bribes received an offender.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> (b)     A policy of imposing disgorgement fines for s 57C(1) offences is not feasible as there can be gratifications (e.g., sexual favours) which are difficult to quantify for the purpose of calibrating the disgorgement fine to be imposed.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

> (c)     There is no precedent of disgorgement fines having been imposed on offenders convicted of a s 57C(1) offence. To impose such a fine on the Accused would be inconsistent with the sentencing precedents.

> (d)     Imposing a disgorgement fine on the Accused is unfair to him as Du – who was involved in the same offence as him – did not receive a disgorgement fine. This unfairness is exacerbated by the fact that Du had also obtained a benefit – by being allowed to remain in Singapore – from committing the offence with the Accused.

55     I am unable to accept the Defence’s submissions, which I find to be neither persuasive nor principled.

> (a)     The courts’ power to impose disgorgement fines is not premised on the existence of a disgorgement provision such as s 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960. As is evident from the cases cited in \[52\] above, courts had imposed disgorgement fines where the relevant legislation did not contain such a provision.

> (b)     I fail to see why the difficulty in quantifying the value of the gratification in certain cases must mean that disgorgement fines cannot be imposed in all other cases where such value can be quantified. Based on the typical case of a s 57C(1) offence, cases where the value of the gratification is difficult to quantify are likely to be rare. Where such cases do come before the court, then the benefit of the doubt can be given to the offender and no disgorgement fine will be imposed.

> (c)     The Defence’s submission that there is no precedent of disgorgement fines having been imposed under s 57C(1) is neither here nor there. In my view, the absence of precedent is a poor reason for not deciding an issue based on principle. This is especially so where the principle is well-established and sound as in the present case. From my perusal of the reported cases, the issue of imposing disgorgement fines for a s 57C(1) offence has not been raised for judicial consideration before. In other words, courts have not ruled that it is wrong in principle to impose such fines. In the circumstances, I am not precluded from deciding on the disgorgement fine issue based on principles.

> (d)     In my view, imposing a disgorgement fine on the Accused would not result in a disparity in sentencing (vis-à-vis Du’s sentence) or an unfair sentence.

>> (i)       The Defence’s submission that there is such a disparity is based on the premise that a disgorgement fine would unfairly deprive the Accused of his gratification. This premise is flawed because the Accused did not have a right to retain such ill-gotten gains in the first place.

>> (ii)       The Defence’s submission that it is unfair that Du was not also required to “disgorge” the immigration advantage that she had enjoyed is misconceived. This submission ignores the obvious fact that the sentence for a s 57C(1) offence is to punish an offender for having entered into a marriage of convenience – it is not to punish the offender for having obtained an immigration advantage. Furthermore, it bears noting that Du did not obtain an immigration advantage by merely entering into a marriage of convenience. To obtain such an advantage, she still had to separately apply for the relevant passes with ICA – which was what had happened in this case. In the process of applying for these passes, Du gave false statements to ICA. For these acts, Du was charged (and convicted) for having committed offences under s 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act: see \[11\] above. The fact that Du had obtained an immigration advantage should (more appropriately) have been considered in the sentences for her s 57(1)(k) offences – and not the sentence for her s 57C(1) offence.

56     In summary, I find that as a matter of principle, a disgorgement fine should be imposed on an offender who has received gratification in his commission of a s 57C(1) offence.

57     I wish to add that if such an offender genuinely cannot afford to pay a disgorgement fine, then as a matter of principle, it would be appropriate to consider imposing an uplift to his term of imprisonment in lieu of the disgorgement fine: see e.g., _Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span> (“**_Yap Ah Lai_**”) at \[17\].

##### Value of gratification exceeds maximum fine

58     Turning back to the present case, I noted that the value of the Accused’s gratification ($18,000) _exceeds_ the maximum fine for a s 57C(1) offence ($10,000) by $8,000. This raises the issue of how this $8,000 is to be addressed in sentencing. For instance, is it appropriate to impose –

> (a)     the maximum fine as a disgorgement fine, _and_

> (b)     an uplift in the imprisonment term

to ensure that the Accused would not benefit from the $8,000 that could not be disgorged (“**Disgorgement-Imprisonment Approach**”)?

59     It appears that the appropriateness of the Disgorgement-Imprisonment Approach has thus far eluded judicial comment. In _Public Prosecutor v Nguyen Thi Hong Lan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 325</span> (“**_Nguyen Thi Hong Lan_**”), the offender had made a profit of $14,000 for arranging a marriage of convenience, a s 57C(2) offence. The court imposed a disgorgement fine of $10,000. The Disgorgement-Imprisonment Approach was not discussed.

60     I am of the view that it would _not_ be appropriate to adopt the Disgorgement-Imprisonment Approach in cases where the value of the gratification _exceeds_ the maximum fine in s 57C(1). My reasons are as follows.

> (a)     First, a disgorgement fine is intended to deprive an offender of his ill-gotten gains. As rightly noted by the Prosecution, a longer term of imprisonment under the Disgorgement-Imprisonment Approach will not achieve the objective of stripping the offender of the ill-gotten gains that exceeds the maximum fine.

> (b)     Second, the Disgorgement-Imprisonment Approach is based on the premise that the value of the gratification which exceeds the maximum fine can be easily “converted” into a term of imprisonment. This premise has been rejected in _Mao Xuezhong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 5 SLR 580</span> at \[55\]. In that case, the High Court of Three Judges emphasised that fines and imprisonment are _different qualitatively_, with imprisonment regarded generally as a more severe punishment than fine. Given this qualitative difference between the two types of sentences, it is difficult to see how a “conversion rate” between a disgorgement fine and imprisonment can be derived in a principled manner for the purpose of applying the Disgorgement-Imprisonment Approach.

> (c)     Finally, I agree with the Prosecution that it is wrong in principle to impose an additional term of imprisonment merely because the maximum disgorgement fine is insufficient to strip an offender of all his illicit gains.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) To impose an uplift in the imprisonment term in such circumstances would result in a sentence that is disproportionate to the offence. To ensure the effectiveness of disgorgement fines as a sentencing tool, it will be more appropriate for Parliament to increase the maximum prescribed fine: Sentencing Principles at \[25.038\] – \[25.041\]; _Lau Jian Bang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1161</span> at \[61\]. I will leave it to the Prosecution and the relevant authorities to consider whether there is a need for such legislative changes to s 57C.

##### Whether significant steps taken to evade detection

61     I now come to the last offence-specific sentencing factor.

62     The fact that an offender has taken steps to prevent the authorities from discovering that his marriage is a sham is clearly a culpability-enhancing factor: _Mehra Radhika_ at \[24(a)\].

63     This aggravating factor has been factored into the sentencing norms for s 57C(1), as they have been applied to offenders who had taken _some_ steps to conceal their crimes. Such steps include the following:

> (a)     Constructing a false relationship history between the parties to the marriage of convenience, such as –

>> (i)       by taking photographs of themselves in various activities and outings to pre-empt the possibility that their marriage of convenience would be questioned and investigated,

>> (ii)       the foreign offender meeting the local offender’s parents.

> (b)     Organising a wedding reception to give the impression that the marriage was a genuine one.

> (c)     Maintaining the façade of a genuine marriage after the solemnisation ceremony in case the authorities were to check on the offenders, such as –

>> (i)       by placing the foreign offender’s belongings in the local offender’s home,

>> (ii)       the foreign offender taking possession of the local offender’s home keys even though the former is not staying there, and

>> (iii)       the local and foreign offenders staying together briefly following the solemnisation ceremony.

See e.g., _Cheng Yew Kwang_ at \[126\]; _Goh Teck Kwee_ at \[102\] and \[109\]; _Ong Jun Long_ at \[23\].

64     In my view, where offenders take _more significant_ steps to conceal their crimes, it would be appropriate to consider imposing a sentence higher than the sentencing norms.

#### Neutral factors

65     For completeness, I wish to state that the following factors – which have frequently been raised in mitigation – are irrelevant to the sentencing of a s 57C(1) offence:

> (a)     The foreign offender has obtained an immigration advantage.

>> (i)       As stated earlier, the fact that a foreign offender has relied on his/her marriage of convenience to obtain an immigration advantage is usually the subject matter of a separate charge under s 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act: _Syed Adumai Shariff_ at \[51\].

>> (ii)       There would be double counting if the fact that a foreign offender has obtained an immigration advantage is factored into the sentences of both the s 57(1)(k) offence and the s 57C(1) offence and both sentences are ordered to run consecutively.

> (b)     The foreign offender has been law abiding.

>> (i)       An offender does not deserve to be given any credit for being law abiding – this is expected of him/her.

>> (ii)       A sentence imposed under s 57C(1) is intended to punish an offender for having entered into a marriage of convenience. It is not to punish him/her for having committed some other offences. Accordingly, the fact that a foreign offender has been law abiding does justify a discount from the sentencing norms. (If an offender has in fact committed a distinct offence, then he/she ought to be charged for that offence and punished accordingly.)

> (c)     The foreign offender has committed the offence to alleviate his/her family or personal circumstances and hardship.

>> Hardship is generally not a mitigating factor unless there are exceptional or extreme circumstances. This is because “\[e\]conomic migration is at its core driven by hardship and some measure of financial duress. No migrant would move and suffer the privations of life in a new land if not motivated by great need”: _Public Prosecutor v Nguyen Thi Tuyet and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 330</span> at \[27\] and \[28\]. See also _Zhang Fengyu_ at \[36\].

## Section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act

66     I will now discuss the sentencing principles applicable to the Accused’s 2nd and 3rd Charges under s 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act.

### Prescribed punishment

67     The prescribed punishment for these charges is as follows:

> 57**.**—(1) Any person who —

>> …

>> (k)    by making a false statement obtains or attempts to obtain an entry or a re-entry permit, pass, Singapore visa or certificate for himself or for any other person;

>> ...

> shall be guilty of an offence and —

>> …

>> (vi)   in the case of an offence under paragraph (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k) or (l), shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both;

>> …

### Sentencing factors

68     The leading sentencing decision on s 57(1)(k) offences is _Abu Syeed Chowdhury v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 182</span> (“**_Abu Syeed Chowdhury_**”). In that case, the High Court identified (at \[28\] – \[31\]) the following sentencing factors for the offence:

> (a)     The materiality of the false representation on the mind of the decision-maker.

> (b)     The nature and extent of the deception.

> (c)     The consequences of the deception.

> (d)     The personal mitigation factors applicable to the offender.

### Sentencing norms

69     It has been held that the sentencing norm for a s 57(1)(k) offence is a term of imprisonment, and that a fine is appropriate only under “exceptional circumstances”: _Abu Syeed Chowdhury_ at \[26\].

70     Section 57(1)(k) covers a wide range of factual situations – e.g., from giving false statements for the purpose of circumventing an immigration ban (_Lin Lifen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 287</span>), to giving false statements for the purpose of frustrating the Official Assignee’s controls over the movements into/out of Singapore by an undischarged bankrupt-offender (_Goh Chin Soon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 401</span>).

71     In the context of false statements made in connection with marriages of convenience, my review of the reported s 57(1)(k) case disclosed the following:

> (a)     The sentencing norm is between four to six weeks’ imprisonment where (i) false residential address was furnished and (ii) a **short-term visit pass** was issued: _Syed Adumai Shariff_ (offender claimed trial); _Cheng Yew Kwang_ (offender claimed trial); _Zhang Fengyu_ (offender pleaded guilty); _Public Prosecutor v Li Cheng Meng and Mu Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 156</span> (offender claimed trial); _Public Prosecutor v Nguyen Thi Diem My_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 203</span> (offender pleaded guilty).

> (b)     The sentencing norm is between six to 10 weeks’ imprisonment where the immigration advantage sought was a **long-term visit pass**: _Public Prosecutor v Ko King Lik Benson_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 62</span> (offender claimed trial); _Nguyen Thi Hong Lan_ (offender claimed trial); _Qin Fuxing_ (offender claimed trial – the long-term visit pass was not issued in this case); _Public Prosecutor v Cao Sifen_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 152</span> (“**_Cao Sifen_**”) (offender claimed trial).

> (c)     Eight weeks’ and nine weeks’ imprisonment have been imposed where the immigration advantage sought was a **permanent resident status in Singapore:** _Public Prosecutor v Do Thi Phuong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 138</span> (offender claimed trial); _Cao Sifen_ (offender claimed trial).

## My sentencing decision

72     Having discussed the applicable principles, I will now explain how I have applied them in sentencing the Accused.

### 1st Charge

#### Imprisonment term

73     I agreed with the parties that the sentencing norm of six months’ imprisonment for guilty plea cases ought to apply to the Accused.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) In coming to this view, I noted the following:

> (a)     The Accused’s case (i) fell within the archetypal case of a s 57C(1) offence and (ii) did not contain any aggravating or mitigating offence-specific sentencing factor.

> (b)     Du, who was also charged for having entered into the marriage with the Accused, was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.

#### Disgorgement fine

74     Given that the Accused had received $18,000 as gratification for entering into the marriage, it would have been appropriate to impose, _in addition to_ the six months’ imprisonment, a disgorgement fine. In my view, a suitable disgorgement fine in the present case would have been $10,000, in default 50 days’ imprisonment.

#### Uplift in imprisonment term

75     During the proceedings, the Defence informed me that the Accused was unable to pay a disgorgement fine. It has been held that fines should generally not be imposed where these are beyond the means of the offender to pay. Where it is evident that the offender will likely not be able to pay a fine, consideration should be given to imposing a sentence of imprisonment instead: _Yap Ah Lai_ at \[17\] and \[57\].

76     In the circumstances, it would be appropriate to sentence the Accused to a higher imprisonment term in lieu of a disgorgement fine. In determining the extent of the uplift in the imprisonment term, I decided against pegging the uplift to the default term of imprisonment of 50 days. This is because a default term of imprisonment is meant to incentivise an offender to pay his fine and not to serve as additional punishment: _Yap Ah Lai_ at \[57\]. To impose an additional 50 days would have led to a disproportionate sentence of about eight months’ imprisonment – which is significantly higher than Du’s sentence of six months’ imprisonment for the same s 57C(1) offence.

77     Bearing in mind the significant value of the gratification that the Accused had received, while at the same time being conscious of the need to avoid a disproportionate sentence, I decided that an appropriate uplift would be one month instead of 50 days. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment for the 1st Charge.

### 2nd and 3rd Charges

#### False statements are material

78     According to the Statement of Facts, the false statements referred to in the 2nd and 3rd Charges were material to ICA’s decision to approve Du’s applications for the relevant visit passes.

#### Extent of deception

79     I found that there was a significant level of deception in the Accused’s offences.

> (a)     The offences in the 2nd and 3rd Charges should not be viewed in isolation. These offences are part of a wider and persistent web of deceit committed by the Accused against ICA to assist Du in obtaining an immigration advantage. Apart from the false statements in the 2nd and 3rd Charges, the Accused had also made numerous other false statements to ICA between December 2019 to August 2020. These are the subject of six “TIC” charges under s 57(1)(k).

> (b)     The number of false statements made by the Accused to ICA reflects his level of culpability. In this regard, I noted that the 3rd Charge contained more false statements than the 2nd Charge. In my view, this difference should be reflected in the Accused’s sentences for the 2nd and 3rd Charges.

#### Consequences of the deception

80     As a result of the Accused’s offences, a short-term visit pass (2nd Charge) and a long-term visit pass (3rd Charge) were issued to Du. The long-term visit pass had allowed Du to remain and work in Singapore for a relatively long period of six months.

81     Further, I noted that according to the charges consented to be taken into consideration, the Accused had also made false statements on other occasions. These statements resulted in Du being issued with six short-term visit passes.

#### Personal mitigating factors

82     In my view, the Defence had failed to show why the Accused deserved to be treated more leniently than other similarly situated offenders who had been sentenced in line with the sentencing norm.

#### Sentence imposed

83     Taking into account all the sentencing factors, I sentenced the Accused to six weeks’ and eight weeks’ imprisonment for the 2nd and 3rd Charges respectively.

84     Additionally, with regard to the 3rd Charge –

> (a)     I noted that the Accused had received $400/month from Du after successfully helping her obtain a long-term visit pass (up to a total of $4,800).

> (b)     In line with the principles discussed in \[50\] – \[52\] above, these illicit gains ought to be disgorged. Given that the maximum fine for a s 57(1)(k) offence is $4,000, a suitable disgorgement fine would have been $4,000, in default 20 days’ imprisonment.

> (c)     However, given that the Accused was unable to pay, I took the view that an _additional_ two weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of a disgorgement fine would be appropriate.

## Conclusion

85     In conclusion, the Accused’s sentences are as follows:

86     I ordered the sentences for the 1st Charge and 3rd Charge to run consecutively. The Accused would thus have to serve an aggregate sentence of seven months’ and 10 weeks’ imprisonment.
