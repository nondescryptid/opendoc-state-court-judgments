### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## Introduction

1       The accused Mr. Abdul Mubarak had claimed trial to a single charge under section 325 of the Penal Code for voluntarily committing grievous hurt as follows -

> “_DAC-936831-2017_

> _\`You are charged that you, on 20 January 2017, at or about 9.20 p.m., at No. 1 Lorong Geylang, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Dabonath Nemai Chandra, to wit, by slapping his face, punching his forehead and face multiple times, strangling his neck, kicking your heel backwards to hit his nose once, and using an air refresher can to hit his forehead a few times, causing the said Dabonath Nemai Chandra to suffer the following injuries:_

>> _\-_      _blood stain over left nostril_,

>> _\-_      _abrasion and blood stain over right right lower lip_,

>> _\-_      _two swelling over the right forehead – 2cm x 3cm with mild tenderness and 2cm x 2cm with mild tenderness, and_

>> _\-_      _non-displaced nasal bone fracture_,

> _and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).”_

## Background

2       At the conclusion of the trial, the accused was found guilty and convicted of the proceeded charge against him. He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment with effect from 18 March 2020.

3       As the accused had been subject to a Probation Order when he had committed the 2017 offence, he was also in breach of his probation order by re-offending. Under the law, he had to be re-sentenced for his original 2016 charge for being in possession of an offensive instrument (a dagger) and thereby committing an offence under s. 22 (1) (a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. For this 2016 charge, I sentenced the accused to 10 weeks imprisonment to take effect upon the expiry of the 6 months imprisonment imposed for the 2017 section 325 Penal Code charge.

4       The accused has now appealed against the sentences imposed on him. Accordingly, I have ordered a stay of execution on the sentence of imprisonment imposed.

5       As the accused has not appealed against his conviction, this grounds of decision will focus only on the appeal against sentence.

## Antecedents

6       As indicated above, the accused was in breach of his probation order. He had pleaded guilty in 2016 to a charge of possession of an offensive instrument under s. 22 (1) (a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. On 12 May 2016, he was placed on 18 months split probation (3 months intensive) and 15 months supervised probation and subject to curfew restrictions and to perform community service of 120 hours. On 13 December 2016, he was brought before the court for poor progress while on probation. He was then placed on a short detention order for 10 days. He was released on 22 December 2016.

## Prosecution submissions

7       For the s. 325 Penal Code charge, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 6 months imprisonment based on the sentencing precedents tendered. As regards the 2016 charge for being in possession of an offensive instrument, the Prosecution submitted that the usual tariff was 12 weeks imprisonment. The Prosecution noted however that the accused had earlier served 10 days detention in prison. As such, it was submitted that a sentence of 10 weeks imprisonment would be appropriate.

## Mitigation

8       Counsel submitted for a sentence of 3 months imprisonment for the s. 325 Penal Code charge. He made no submission as regards the sentence for the breach charge and stated that he would leave sentence to the court. It was also submitted that the accused was now married and also has an infant daughter to care for with his wife. In the written mitigation plea submitted by Counsel, it was also submitted that the accused was working as a senior wildlife management officer with N Parks. It was also submitted that his job is his passion and he loves working with animals.[^1]

## Reasons for sentence

9       The Prosecution had submitted that the proper sentencing approach to be applied to a section 325 Penal Code offence is a 2 step approach. Such an approach was established by the Court of Appeal in _PP v BDB <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span>_. In _PP v BDB_, it was held \[at 55\] that:-

> a.    the Court should first establish the indicative starting point of the sentence based on the seriousness of the injury.

> b.    after having establishing the starting point of the sentence, the Court should have regard to aggravating and mitigating factors in the case before adjusting the sentence.

10     The Prosecution had also referred to 2 case precedents. In the case of _PP v Samson Tanuwidjaja <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 228</span>_, the accused was a patron of a nightspot. The victim who was a waitress, refused to follow the accused when he accosted her after her work. When she refused to follow him, the accused punched her multiple times on her face and upper chest area and she passed out. The accused was charged with a single count of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the victim, Chen Tessie Verterra, female/31, _to wit_, by punching the victim several times on her face and her upper chest area, causing her to suffer the following injuries:

> a.     1. 2cm bruise over her forehead;

> b.     2. 2cm swelling over her right cheek;

> c.     3. 1cm laceration on her right parietal region; and

> d.     Displaced fracture at the tip of her nasal bone.

The accused had dissimilar road traffic antecedents. He was convicted after a trial and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment. On appeal, the High Court _increase_d the sentence to 9 months imprisonment. The appeal by the accused against conviction and sentence was dismissed.

11     The Prosecution also cited a second case – _PP v Tan Xian Wen Denny <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 459</span>._ The accused was charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt under Section 325 of the Penal Code, to one Kaelen Hoon Hao Jun, to wit, by punching the said victim’s face twice, thereby causing him to sustain a displaced nasal bone open fracture and nose laceration. The accused had previously in 2005 been placed on probation in the juvenile court for theft offences and also in 2008 sentenced to RTC for drug offences. In 2013, he was fined for road traffic offences. He had pleaded guilty to the s. 325 Penal Code charge and was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment. The accused’s appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court.

12     Counsel had submitted for a sentence of 3 months imprisonment at the mitigation and sentencing stage and after the accused was convicted at the conclusion of the trial. Counsel did not however submit any sentencing precedents to support his sentencing position.

13     The Prosecution had explained in oral sentencing submissions that as the victim Dabonath had suffered a “non-displaced nasal bone fracture” unlike the victim in the _Tan Xian Wen Denny_ case who had suffered a _displaced_ nasal bone fracture, a similar sentence of also 6 months imprisonment was justified. I agreed with this submission by the Prosecution. In accordance with the 2-step sentencing approach established by _PP v BDB_, I calibrated the indicative starting point as 6 months imprisonment based on the similar injury suffered by both victims of a nasal bone fracture.

14     There were no aggravating factors submitted by the Prosecution. The mitigation by Counsel also did not disclose any exceptional mitigating factors to justify a reduction of the indicative starting position of 6 months imprisonment. Furthermore, I have noted that in the _Tan Xian Wen Denny_ case, the accused had pleaded guilty. Whereas the present accused Abdul Mubarak had claimed trial and was therefore not entitled to the usual sentencing discount given to accused persons who had pleaded guilty and had thereby demonstrated remorse.

15     As for the breach sentence, Counsel did not make a submission on sentence and had left sentence to the court. I noted that the Prosecution had submitted that the usual tariff for a possession of an offensive instrument charge was 12 weeks imprisonment. The Prosecution noted however that the accused had earlier served 10 days detention in prison. As such, it was submitted that a sentence of 10 weeks imprisonment would be appropriate. I agreed with this submission of the Prosecution. I pause to observe here that this was also an eminently fair sentencing stance of the Prosecution as the accused had previously served a 10-day detention order while still on probation, albeit for poor progress while on probation.

## Conclusion

16     For the above reasons, I sentenced the accused to 6 months imprisonment for the 2017 charge under section 325 of the Penal Code. As for the re-sentence for the 2016 charge for possession of an offensive instrument under s. 22 (1) (a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, the accused was sentenced to 10 weeks imprisonment. For this sentence for the 2016 charge, I ordered that the sentence of 10 weeks imprisonment is to take effect upon the expiry of the 6 months imprisonment imposed for the 2017 charge under section 325 of the Penal Code.

17     In my judgment, the above sentences are fair, proportionate and cannot be considered reasonably, to be manifestly excessive in any way.
