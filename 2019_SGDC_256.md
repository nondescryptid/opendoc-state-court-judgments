3       The Accused was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 5 years 4 months and three strokes of the cane.

## Case for Prosecution

4       The Prosecution called at total of 11 witnesses. One of them (Ms Ng Xue Qin) was also recalled as a rebuttal witness after the close of the Defence’s case.

## Case for Defence

5       The Defence contended that the presence of amphetamine in his urine samples arose from his consumption of Dhasedyl. This was the only defence.

## The Undisputed Facts

6       On 13 February 2018, the Accused was arrested for suspected drug offences. The Police also seized from the Accused, one slab of 10 Nitrazepam pills, three tubes believed to be drug instruments, one straw believed to be used for drug related purpose and one black pouch. See exhibit P1.

7       The Accused was brought to the CNB office at Ang Mo Kio Police Division where his urine samples were procured in accordance with the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 6) (“MDR”). There was no dispute by the Accused as to his urine procurement process.

8       I adopted and reproduced here the relevant undisputed facts succinctly stated in the Prosecution’s written submission dated 30 Oct 2019 (without the footnotes):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>“at the CNB office at Ang Mo Kio Police Division, the accused provided his urine samples in accordance with the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 6) (“MDR”).

She then handed them over to SSgt Ramadhan, who requested the accused to confirm his particulars on the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) labels by appending his signature, and sealed the two bottles properly. The accused then deposited the two bottles into the two metal boxes, which were submitted to the HSA later on the same day by SSgt Isa for analysis.

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

9       At the close of the Prosecution’s case, after hearing the parties’ submissions and considering the evidence, I found that the Prosecution has made out the case against the Accused in that there were some evidence not inherently incredible that satisfied each element of the charge. The defence was called and the Accused elected to give evidence after the standard allocution has been administered. Two other witnesses were also called by the Accused to give evidence on his behalf. These two witnesses were procured for the Defence with the assistance of the Prosecution.

## The Applicable Law

13     Section 22 of the MDA states that “if any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).”

14     The Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 802</span> at \[10\] held that upon the compliance with s 31(4)(b) MDA and “if there are positive results from both of the urine tests carried out pursuant to this subsection, the s 22 presumption will operate to presume that the accused person has, in contravention of s 8(b), consumed the controlled drug detected in his urine samples. This means that both the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_ of the s 8(b) offence are presumed by s 22”.

15     Hence, the burden shifted to the Accused to rebut this presumption by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he had not knowingly consumed amphetamine.

## My Findings

16     The only issue was whether the Accused’s urine was tested positive for amphetamine due to his alleged consumption of medication. I found that the Accused has not disproved both the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ of the consumption charge on a balance of probabilities.

17     I now state the reasons for my findings.

## Evaluation of the Defence

18     I found the Accused was an inconsistent witness not worthy of any credit.

19     Briefly, this was the evidence of the Accused. The Accused alleged that his urine samples were found to contain amphetamine due to the consumption of Dhasedyl cough syrup. The Accused claimed that after his arrest, he consumed cough syrup prescribed by Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. On further cross-examination, the Accused clarified that he could not remember whether this was before or after the procurement of his urine sample. Then he admitted that the Dhasedyl cough syrup that he consumed, was the one prescribed by Ren Medical Clinic in August 2017. His testimony in court was also inconsistent with his police statement (exhibit P7) where he stated that he consumed only the “Epam” tablets and did not consume any over the counter medication or traditional medication. When highlighted to the Accused of his failure to state the consumption of Dhasedyl in his police statement, the Accused then alleged that the statement recorder Sgt Tan Jian Bao had pressured or threatened him. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was an afterthought.

20     The Accused’s evidence was clearly inconsistent both internally and externally. Accordingly, I rejected the Accused’s allegation that he had consumed Dhasedyl cough syrup.

2.     Dr. Leong Hoe Nam (DW2) gave evidence on behalf of the Accused.

22     DW2 testified that consuming Dhasedyl would not give rise to a positive result for Methamphetamine in the person’s urine. DW2 added that “the product Dhasedyl, does not give---does not contain amphetamine or amphetamine-like products. It may give you a positive opioid test instead but it does not cause a positive amphetamine result.” DW 2 confirmed that Dhasedyl has three active compounds - codeine, promethazine and ephedrine. Ephedrine would be in a similar class as amphetamine. However, DW2 admitted he was in no position to testify whether consumption of ephedrine would cause the urine to have a positive result for amphetamine. He conceded that he had to defer to the expert opinion of the HSA analysts who testified on behalf of the Prosecution. After all, he was an Infectious Disease Specialist whose expertise lies in virology and treatment of complex infectious diseases. DW2 agreed that the chemical structure of the ingredients in Dhasedyl, is actually different from those in amphetamines.

23     During cross-examination, DW2 also confirmed that the Accused was under his care while in prison for his HIV conditions. He conceded that he was not an expert to comment on, whether for a fact, consumption of Dhasedyl or Procodin or other cough syrup will give rise to amphetamine in one’s urine samples.

24     Mr Teeranun Rodsiri (DW3) was a pharmacist. He gave evidence for the Defence. He testified that ephedrine in Dhasedyl may cause a false positive of amphetamine in one’s urine samples. However, he clarified during his cross-examination that he was referring to the presumptive screening test, which may show a false positive for amphetamine.

25     DW3 conceded that he was not a qualified expert to comment whether the consumption of Dhasedyl would give rise to amphetamine. He agreed that the confirmatory test would be able to distinguish the two drugs – ephedrine and amphetamine. DW3 also concurred with the conclusion of the HSA analysts that the presence of amphetamine in the Accused’s urine samples was consistent with the consumption of methamphetamine.

## Evaluation of the Evidence for the Prosecution

26     Both the HSA analysts, namely, Ms Ng Xue Qin (PW9) and Mr Ong Han Hui Jordan (PW10) from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory testified that the concentration of amphetamine found in the Accused’s urine samples received by them were 695 ng/ml and 703 ng/ml respectively, which were above the cut-off concentration of 500 ng/ml. They testified that methamphetamine was also detected in the said urine samples and that amphetamine is a metabolite of methamphetamine.

27     Both these HSA analysts confirmed that consumption of the medications prescribed to the Accused by Ren Medical Clinic (See exhibit D1) and Changi Complex Medical Centre (see exhibit D2), including Dhasedyl, will not give rise to the presence of amphetamine in the urine samples.

28     PW9 also testified that the three ingredients in Dhasedyl, namely, codeine, ephedrine and promethazine, have different structures compared to amphetamine. As such, the testing method used by HSA was able to differentiate these three ingredients from amphetamine. PW9 added that there was no necessity to test or experiment the medications by asking a human to consume it to see what drugs they metabolise in the urine samples. This was because based on their structure and their pathway for metabolism it was illogical for it to form amphetamine in the body with these ingredients.

29     PW9 explained that there was a screening test and a confirmatory test done in respect of the Accused’s urine samples. The screening test was a presumptive test for a class of amphetamines. The confirmatory test, also known as Liquid Chromatography in Tandem Mass Spectrometry, was a more specific analysis for amphetamine and methamphetamine. This procedure was in accordance with the international guidelines. The confirmatory test confirmed there was amphetamine in the Accused’s urine samples.

30     Both the defence witnesses did not doubt the analysis and opinion of the said HSA analysts. There was no good reason for me to doubt the credibility of the HSA analysts. Accordingly, I gave full weight to their testimony.

## GUILTY AND CONVICTED

31     Having heard the evidence for the Defence, even if the Accused did consume Dhasedyl, I found that it would not have caused his urine samples to contain amphetamine. Both the HSA analysts and the Defence witnesses confirmed that the consumption of Dhasedyl would not give rise to the presence of amphetamine in the Accused’s urine samples. In any event, as stated earlier at \[20\] above, I have rejected the Accused’s claim that he had consumed Dhasedyl at the material time.

32     I accepted the HSA analysts’ opinion that it was the consumption of methamphetamine, which caused its metabolite amphetamine, to be present in the Accused’s urine samples.

33     Having considered the evidence and the respective submissions of the parties, I also found that the Prosecution has successfully invoked the s22 MDA presumption. I was of the view that the Accused has failed to rebut the s 22 MDA presumption on a balance of probabilities.

34     In the circumstances, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the charge against the Accused in that he had consumed amphetamine, a specified drug, on or before 13 February 2018 without any authorisation. Accordingly, I found him guilty and convicted him on the charge, namely, DAC905764/2018.

## ANTECEDENTS

35     The Accused was a recalcitrant offender. His first conviction in court was in 1998 and was sentenced to undergo RTC for an offence under s457 Penal Code.

36     Besides the drug related antecedents, the Accused was also convicted for robbery in 2013 and was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 12 strokes of the cane.

## PROSECUTION’S ADDRESS ON SENTENCE

37     The Prosecution submitted for a term of imprisonment of 5 years 6 months and the minimum mandated caning. Prosecution was of the view that an uplift of 6 months from the minimum prescribed imprisonment term of 5 years was warranted on account of the lack of remorse shown by the Accused and the manner in which he had conducted his defence.

## MITIGATION

38     The Accused submitted for the minimum mandated sentence prescribed

## SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS

39     Given the nature of the offence committed by the Accused was drug related and his antecedents, I was of the view that the main sentencing consideration must be general and specific deterrence.

40     In assessing the sentence, I also considered the punishment prescribed for the offence committed by the Accused. The penalty prescribed for second time drug consumption offence is a mandatory minimum imprisonment of 5 years up to a maximum imprisonment of 7 years and a minimum of 3 strokes of the cane up to a maximum of 6 strokes of the cane.

## Conclusion

41     I was of the view that the circumstances of this case attracted both specific and general deterrence. I noted that the Accused’s previous terms of imprisonment did not deter him from re-offending. Very shortly after his release from imprisonment for the last drug offence in 2016, he re-offended in February 2018. Clearly, he needed to be specifically deterred from re-offending. Hence, an uplift from the minimum mandated imprisonment was necessary to give weight to the element of specific deterrence.

42     I agreed with the Prosecution that there was lack of remorse shown by the Accused. I was of the view that an imprisonment term of 5 years 4 months and three strokes of the cane was an appropriate sentence and proportionate to his overall criminality. The sentence of imprisonment was backdated to 4 Oct 2018.

43     The Accused is currently serving his sentence.
