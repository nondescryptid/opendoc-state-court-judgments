20 March 2020

### District Judge Prem Raj Prabakaran:

## Introduction

1       Quah Siew Hong @ Mabel was employed as a “Manager” of CHIN LIN BUS SERVICE (PTE) LTD (“the Company”) for more than 14 years, from 2 May 2000 to 25 August 2014.[^1] The Company was a very small one. It comprised only Quah and four directors (one of whom died in October 2013[^2]).

2       The Company was in the business of supplying diesel to transport operators. Its customers first had to pay a deposit.[^3] In return, they received a chip[^4] and a code number for each of their vehicles. Their drivers would then use these to operate the diesel pumps on the Company’s premises.[^5] Details about a customer’s diesel consumption would be recorded for billing purposes whenever their drivers refuelled.[^6]

3       As “Manager”, Quah collected payments from these customers on the Company’s behalf. Customers would pay by way of cheques issued to the Company, cash cheques, or in cash.[^7] Quah was also in charge of the Company’s accounts. Indeed, the evidence showed that she was the _only_ one in the Company who knew how to use its accounting system/software (or “ACCPAC”). Quah used ACCPAC to record the Company’s transactions with its customers, and to prepare its accounting records.

4       Quah claimed trial to five charges for criminal breach of trust by a servant, an offence under s 408 of the Penal Code.[^8] The offences were purportedly committed over almost _five_ years: between 24 July 2009 and 30 June 2014 (“the offending period”). The property allegedly misappropriated comprised payments she had collected from _six_ of the Company’s customers.[^9] These had all been made in cash or by way of cash cheques. In all, the Prosecution alleged 168 distinct instances of misappropriation of various cash cheques and sums of cash – totalling almost $920,000. Each charge encompassed the instances of alleged misappropriation over different segments of the offending period (that did not exceed 12 months). The gross sums allegedly misappropriated differed across the charges. A sample of one of these charges read as follows:

> …that you, \[purported offending period that did not exceed 12 months\], at No 7, Old Toh Tuck Road, Singapore, being employed as a servant by \[the Company\], to wit, a Manager, and in such capacity being entrusted with property, to wit, a sum of \[alleged gross sum misappropriated\], did commit criminal breach of trust by dishonestly misappropriating the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 408 of the Penal Code…

5       The distinguishing particulars in the five charges were as follows:

6       Quah did not dispute that she was “employed as a servant” by the Company during the offending period. She also admitted that she had collected the _full_ sum stated in all the charges – which belonged to the Company[^13] – as part of her duties as “Manager” (collectively, “the Entrusted Monies”).[^14] She therefore accepted that she was entrusted with the Entrusted Monies in the capacity of a servant. In addition, she agreed that she did not bank _any_ of the Entrusted Monies into the Company’s bank account (“the Company’s Account”).[^15] Indeed, the unchallenged evidence showed that Quah:

> (a)     deposited the large majority of the cash cheques that she collected into her three _personal_ bank accounts (of which two were lines of _credit_); and

> (b)     deposited some of the cash cheques she collected into:

>> (i)       her mother’s bank account[^16], which she maintained[^17]; and

>> (ii)       a joint account she held with her nephew.[^18]

7       However, Quah denied dishonestly misappropriating any of the Entrusted Monies. Instead, she claimed that she handed all of the Entrusted Monies to one of the Company’s directors – Tan Song Mong (“TSM”). It was her case that TSM had instructed her to do so, and she was merely complying with his directions during the offending period.[^19] TSM denied these allegations vigorously.[^20] The key issue was thus whether Quah had dishonestly misappropriated the Entrusted Monies.

8       I convicted Quah on all five charges, following a 10-day trial. Having observed the witnesses as they testified, I found the witnesses called by the Prosecution – which included TSM and the remaining two directors of the Company – candid and truthful. They all testified in a straightforward manner. Quah was, however, an evasive and inconsistent witness. Key aspects of her testimony were either contradicted or unsupported by other evidence. Her defence also constantly changed (even between days of trial) whenever she was confronted with contrary evidence. She was not at all averse to raising a multitude of fresh claims/allegations during her cross-examination, to try to explain away the glaring discrepancies in her case. She struck me as a distinctly unreliable and untruthful witness. She failed to either satisfactorily account for the Entrusted Monies (that she admitted she was entrusted with, and for which she was accountable) or offer any plausible explanation for their loss. Indeed, the evidence showed that she also unilaterally manipulated the Company’s accounting records (which she solely prepared) on ACCPAC (which only she could access) to hide her dishonest misappropriation of the Entrusted Monies.

9       I then sentenced Quah as follows:

10     Quah appealed her convictions and sentences. The execution of these sentences has been stayed, pending the hearing of her appeals. These are my grounds of decision.

## Agreed & undisputed facts

11     The facts agreed between the parties are set out in this section.[^21] Those not disputed during the course of the trial are included as well.

### A small company with only 4/5 employees

12     The Company had between three and four directors during the offending period. They were also its shareholders.[^22] Three directors testified for the Prosecution: Lim Eng Chuan (“LEC”); Neo Eng Seng (“NES”); and TSM (collectively, “the Directors”). The Company’s fourth director, Ong Bock Chay, died in October 2013. The Directors all testified in Mandarin, through an interpreter. They were all also rather elderly. Their highest education level ranged from Primary 3 to Secondary 3 (only).

13     LEC and NEC did not know how to turn on a computer. They also did not know how to use ACCPAC, the accounting system/software that Quah used to record the Company’s transactions and to prepare its accounting records.[^23] Quah had used ACCPAC since she joined the Company in 2000.

14     Unlike the Directors, Quah’s highest level of education was the GCE “A” Level. She was hence the Company’s best educated employee. She also testified in Mandarin. But, she agreed during the trial that her level of proficiency in the English language – in terms of reading; writing; and speaking – was _far_ higher than that of the Directors.[^24] I set out some details about the composition of the Company in the table below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="9.5380923815237%"> <col width="10.8178364327135%"> <col width="31.6336732653469%"> <col width="48.0103979204159%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Name</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Age<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Highest education level</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Remarks</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Quah</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">65</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">GCE “A” Level</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">·Most proficient in English language</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">·Computer/ACCPAC literate</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">NES</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">73</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Secondary 3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">·Very limited proficiency in English language</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">·Computer/ACCPAC illiterate</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">LEC</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">76</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Primary 5</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TSM</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">79</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Primary 3</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">·Very limited proficiency in English language</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">·See also [107]-[110] below</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

15     Quah was the only person in the Company who gave LEC and NEC documents to sign in the course of their work.[^26]

### Directors never borrowed money from Company

16     The Directors never borrowed money from the Company.[^27]

### TSM lent Company money to pay diesel supplier

17     LEC and NES never lent money to the Company. However, they knew that TSM did so. TSM had been lending money (without interest) to the Company for many years.[^28] The sums he lent the Company each time ranged from $20,000 to $40,000. His loans were a recurring practice, to tide the Company over financial difficulties. He would lend money to the Company for it to pay its diesel supplier whenever Quah informed him that the Company had yet to receive payment from its customers (which it would have ordinarily used to pay its supplier). TSM did not record the sums he lent to the Company. LEC and NES also did not keep records.[^29] The sums that TSM lent to the Company were returned to him whenever payment was received from its customers.

### Company never cancelled/voided concluded sales transactions

18     Throughout the course of its operations, the Company never cancelled or voided a concluded sales transaction with any of its customers. It therefore never had to give any of its customers a refund of the monies they had already paid to the Company. In any event, it was also not possible for a customer to return any diesel to the Company (and seek a refund) once it had been pumped into a vehicle.[^30]

### Fion & SINCL PTE LTD

19     SINCL PTE LTD (“SINCL”) and the Company shared office premises (“the Office”). The Directors were also its directors. SINCL dealt with vehicle insurance coverage. Ong Sueh Peng (“Fion”) handled SINCL’s accounts.[^31]

20     In the course of her work at SINCL, Fion would sometimes receive cash payments from SINCL’s clients. If these were “large amounts”, TSM would ask her to deposit these payments directly into SINCL’s corporate account. However, if these were “small amounts” (“like a few hundred dollars”), Fion would pass them to TSM instead.[^32] TSM would record the sums he received in a book that he kept (“the Cash Record Book”). When Fion balanced SINCL’s accounts at the end of each month, TSM would issue a personal cheque to SINCL for a sum equivalent to all the cash payments he had received from Fion in that month. Fion would fill in this sum on TSM’s personal cheque. TSM would sign this cheque, and pass it to her or LEC to deposit into SINCL’s corporate account. This practice was adopted because it was “very troublesome” to go to the bank to deposit small amounts of cash payments every time they were received.[^33]

### Auditors & audited accounts

21     Unless exempted, a company must have a general audit done every financial year to comply with the Companies Act (and before any annual general meeting can be held).[^34] The Company had appointed M/s Heng Lee Seng LLP (“the Audit Firm”), since 1974, to conduct its general audits. Heng Lee Seng (“Heng”), a chartered accountant, was the firm’s founder.[^35] The audited accounts of the Company (prepared after the general audits) were admitted into evidence (collectively, the “Audited Accounts”). They spanned five financial years (from 2010 to 2014), and were all in English.

22     I set out some details of these Audited Accounts in the following table:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="77.66%"> <col width="22.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Audited Accounts</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Exhibit</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">For financial year ended 30 June 2010 (dated 13 December 2010)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>D8</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">For financial year ended 30 June 2011 (dated 16 February 2012)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>D9</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">For financial year ended 30 June 2012 (dated 20 November 2012)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>D10</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">For financial year ended 30 June 2013 (dated 28 October 2013)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>D11</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">For financial year ended 30 June 2014 (dated 16 December 2014)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>D6</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

23     The audited accounts for each financial year included a Directors’ Report, which concluded with a similarly worded “Statement by Directors”. For instance, the statement in the audited accounts for the financial year that ended on 30 June 2014 (the “FY2014 Report”) read as follows:

> In the opinion of the \[Directors\]:

>> (a)    the accompanying financial statements of the \[Company\]…are drawn up so as to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the \[Company\] as at 30 June 2014 and of the results of the business, changes in equity and cash flows of the \[Company\] for the financial year then ended; and

>> (b)    at the date of this statement there are reasonable grounds to believe that the \[Company\] will be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due.

24     TSM and LEC had signed on the Directors’ behalf under this statement.

25     Between 2009 and 2014:[^36]

> (a)     Heng liaised with Quah on matters relating to the Audit Firm’s general audits of the Company. He did so because Quah was “in charge of the \[Company’s\] accounts”. The Audit Firm would also look for Quah whenever it had queries about the Company’s accounts – because Quah was the “only person” in the Company who knew about its accounts.

> (b)     the Audit Firm did not discover any “serious problems” with the Company’s accounts during its general audits.

### Quah’s substantial role in Company’s financial affairs

26     As “Manager”, Quah’s duties in the Company included:[^37]

> (a)     generating invoices every month using ACCPAC, and sending these to the Company’s customers.

> (b)     collecting payments due from customers on the Company’s behalf (in the form of cheques issued to the Company, cash cheques, and cash[^38]).

> (c)     preparing the Company’s accounts using ACCPAC, which she had used since she joined the Company in 2000.[^39] Quah would enter details relating to the Company’s transactions with its customers on ACCPAC. These details included invoice reference numbers; the amounts stated on the invoices; mode of payment; cheque numbers (if applicable), the date payment was made; the amount paid; and any balance due.[^40] ACCPAC would then generate a separate accounting record for each customer (the “Transactions Record”).

> (d)     liaising with:

>> (i)       the Company’s customers on payment[^41];

>> (ii)       the Audit Firm; and

>> (iii)       various statutory bodies, including the Inland Revenue Authority.

> (e)     filing the Company’s income tax returns.[^42]

### Fion’s limited role in Company

27     Fion had no access to the Company’s accounting records on ACCPAC.[^43] That said, she assisted Quah by taking calls and collecting payments from the Company’s customers when Quah was not in the Office. Fion also prepared spreadsheets every month, which (simply) tabulated the sums stated on the invoices issued by the Company to its customers (“the Monthly Invoices Spreadsheet”).[^44]

### Quah deposited Company’s cash cheques into her five bank accounts[^45]

28     Quah effectively had five bank accounts. She deposited a number of the Company’s cash cheques (forming part of the Entrusted Monies) into these accounts.

#### Three personal bank accounts (including two credit lines)

29     Quah was the sole holder of three personal bank accounts:

30     Quah’s Cashline Account was neither a current account nor a savings account. It was a credit line, on which she had to pay interest to the bank whenever she withdrew money (_ie_, whenever Quah withdrew money from this account, she was in fact borrowing money from the bank).[^46]

31     Quah’s CashPlus Account was also a credit line. It was in overdraft from January 2010 until she closed it in April 2012 (_ie_, Quah had withdrawn more money from the account than that deposited, and so owed the bank interest).[^47]

#### Joint account with nephew

32     Quah held a joint account with her nephew[^48] (one Jony Guah) (“the Joint Account”), which she closed on 27 June 2014. The bank statements (**AB5**) showed her transactions with this account from 3 March 2014 to 27 June 2014.

#### Mother’s account

33     Quah’s mother, Tan Ah Nya, was the sole holder of a savings account. Quah “maintained” this account for her mother (who was elderly, wheelchair bound, and a heart patient with dementia).[^49] The bank statements (**AB6**) showed Quah’s transactions with this account in October 2010.

### Company’s six customers (“Clients”)

34     The Entrusted Monies originated from six of the Company’s customers (individually, “the Client”; collectively, “the Clients”):

35     The Clients paid the Company in different modes. That said, these modes all included cash and/or cash cheques. The table on the following page sets out the modes of payment employed by the Clients.

36     Quah prepared all of the invoices that the Company issued to the Clients (EDS and Win Tran were invoiced as one entity[^53]) between 2009 and 2014. She also prepared each Client’s Transactions Record (collectively, “the Clients’ Transactions Records”).[^54]

### Audit verifications issued in 2013 & 2014

37     In August 2013 and August 2014, “audit verification letters” were issued to EDS and the Directors. These were all in English. The Audit Firm had prepared these letters at the end of their general audits in 2013 and 2014, after the Company’s accounts had been finalised. It then forwarded these letters to the Company, and asked Quah to get the Directors to sign them.[^55] Each letter comprised two sections:

> (a)     The first section stated a specific sum that the addressee owed the Company or _vice versa_. The sums stated on the letters issued to the Directors were derived from the “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” account in the Company’s general ledger.[^56] Quah had entered the accounting records for this account on ACCPAC.[^57] The Company’s “Director/Accountant” had to append his/her signature in this section, to confirm the sum stated (as owed or owing).

> (b)     The second section was a “Confirmation Reply” to the Audit Firm. This section required the addressee to confirm the correctness of the sum stated (as owed or owing).

38     The letter to EDS was dated 20 August 2013 (**P11**; “the EDS Audit Verification”). It stated that the Company’s records showed that EDS owed the Company $26,309.98 as at 30 June 2013. This letter read as follows:

> Our records show that as at 30 June 2013 the balance due by you is S$26,309.98.

> No money received by us after that date has been taken into account in arriving at the above amount.

> For audit purposes, please sign in the space provided below if you agree with the above amount.

> If you do not agree with the amount, please give full details of the difference for which purpose the reverse side of this letter may be used.

> In either case, please sign and return this letter in the enclosed reply-paid envelope DIRECTLY TO OUR AUDITOR…

> This is merely a request for verification.

39     TSM had appended his signature in the first section, as the Company’s Director. Ho had appended his signature in the second section on 27 August 2013, to confirm that he owed this sum to the Company. He had then mailed this letter to the Audit Firm. He paid this sum to the Company sometime after (but within 2013).[^58]

40     The contents of the six letters issued to the Directors were similar to the EDS Audit Verification. Quah had given these letters to the Directors to sign.[^59] Five of these letters stated that the Company’s records at the end of the financial year showed that the Directors owed the Company a sum of money. Their key aspects are set out below:

### Special audit (August-September 2014)

41     After the general audit for the financial year ending on 30 June 2014, TSM asked to meet the Audit Firm. Heng and Jenny Heng (“Jenny”), a chartered accountant and a partner at the Audit Firm, attended this meeting.

42     During the meeting, TSM expressed concerns over the increase in the Company’s overdraft and fall in profits. He also informed Heng and Jenny that he had learnt in a meeting with Ho that EDS had been paying the Company with cash cheques instead of crossed cheques payable to the Company.[^60] TSM was concerned that the accountant in charge of the Company’s accounts (_ie_, Quah) was misappropriating funds, specifically from EDS. This was because Quah was also in charge of collecting payments from customers. TSM therefore asked the Audit Firm to conduct a special audit to investigate. The Audit Firm thus assigned Jenny to take charge of the special audit sometime in August 2014. Jenny (hereinafter, “the Special Auditor”) was to check the Company’s accounts for irregularities. She had never handled the Company’s general audits before, and was hence regarded as best placed to conduct the special audit.[^61]

43     At the time of the special audit, the Company had only retained accounting records from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2014.[^62] The auditor who was involved in the recently concluded general audit in 2014[^63] assisted the Special Auditor by extracting the following documents from ACCPAC:[^64]

> (a)     the Clients’ Transactions Records.[^65]

> (b)     the Company’s general ledger. This comprised various accounts and recorded all of the Company’s transactions. It included the records of two accounts: “OTHER INCOME” and “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS”.

44     The special audit involved the following steps:[^66]

> (a)      First, the amounts the Clients paid to the Company, as recorded (by Quah) in the Clients’ Transactions Records, were checked against the corresponding bank deposit slips and bank statements of the Company’s Account.[^67]

> (b)      Second, the amounts that Quah had recorded as having been paid by the Clients (on the Clients’ Transactions Records) that could not be traced to these bank deposit slips and bank statements were identified for further investigations (the “Missing Payments”).

> (c)      Third, the Missing Payments were checked against the Company’s general ledger.[^68] The various accounts in the general ledger related to each other in that to balance the accounts, a debit entry had to correspond to a credit entry. The accounts would not balance if there was no such correspondence.[^69]

45     It was the Special Auditor’s (unchallenged) evidence that whenever a payment was received from a Client, the Client’s account _should_ be credited by the sum received to indicate that the relevant invoice had been paid. If this sum was banked into the Company’s Account, the corresponding debit entry _should_ then go to the bank ledger. Here, the Clients’ accounts had been credited to reflect the payments received from them. However, there were no corresponding debit entries in the bank ledger. Instead, the Special Auditor traced the Missing Payments to two _other_ accounts.[^70] In particular, she found that the Missing Payments had been:

> (a)     debited to the “OTHER INCOME” account[^71] (these payments were marked ![]([2020] SGDC 0066_Image/[2020] SGDC 0066_image1.png) on the Clients’ Transactions Records); and

> (b)     debited to the “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” account[^72] (these payments were marked ![]([2020] SGDC 0066_Image/[2020] SGDC 0066_image2.png)on the Clients’ Transactions Records).

46     In other words, the Missing Payments marked ![]([2020] SGDC 0066_Image/[2020] SGDC 0066_image1.png) and ![]([2020] SGDC 0066_Image/[2020] SGDC 0066_image2.png) were payments from the Clients that Quah had _failed_ to deposit into the Company’s Account.[^73] The amounts stated in the charges corresponded to these Missing Payments. [^74]

47     Where the Missing Payments were debited to the “OTHER INCOME” account (and not the bank ledger), this _reduced_ the Company’s revenue/income.[^75] It had the effect of reversing a concluded sale to a Client (or eliminating the invoice raised in respect of that Client). It reversed the amount of “Other Income” earned by the Company.[^76] These entries were irregular because they suggested that the Company was cancelling its concluded sales transactions with the Clients – when it was not possible for diesel to be returned to the Company after it had already been pumped into a customer’s vehicle.[^77]

48     Where the Missing Payments were debited to the “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” account (and not the bank ledger), this _increased_ the amount the Directors owed to the Company.[^78] These entries appeared irregular because they suggested that the Directors had received payments from the Clients and so owed money to the Company.[^79]

49     The special audit ended sometime in end-September 2014.[^80] Heng then told TSM to “get a lawyer because the amount \[involved was\] very big”.[^81]

50     The irregularities uncovered during the special audit were not detected during the general audits. It was Heng’s (unchallenged) evidence that this was because the “accounting records \[were\] full of figures” and Quah had entered these (irregular) entries into the accounting records “like any other ordinary figure”. One was “not likely to uncover anything” unless a “very detailed” and directed check was done.[^82]

51     When TSM asked Heng why these irregularities were not detected during the general audits by the Audit Firm, Heng told TSM that “he would just pick and choose, selectively check. If there had been problems, \[and Quah\] had given him some explanation, he would \[have\] let it off and not probe further”.[^83]

### Quah’s resignation on 20 June 2014

52     Quah tendered her resignation on 20 June 2014 (**AB19**). Her resignation letter was typewritten in English, and in the following innocuous terms:

> Dear Sirs

> It is with regret that I write to formally notify you of my decision to resign from my position as Manager. My last day with the company will be on 15 September 2014 giving three (03) months’ notice & offsetting my balance annual leave. Please let me have the pro-rated AWS including my salary on 15 September 2014.

> After a long and careful consideration of all factors, I have decided it is time to move on and give others an opportunity to take over my current portfolio. I appreciated the support and valuable experiences that I have been given during the past fourteen years of working with the Company.

> I wish you and the Company all the best in the future.

> Thank you.

### TSM told Quah to leave Company on 25 August 2014

53     In her resignation letter, Quah had stated that her last day with the Company would be on 15 September 2014. It was eventually on 25 August 2014, when TSM told her to leave the Office soon after she entered its premises that morning.[^84]

### Quah’s 1st police report against TSM on 26 August 2014[^85]

54     On 26 August 2014[^86], Quah lodged a police report against TSM (**D4**). In her report, she alleged that TSM had molested her sometime in November 2013. She also claimed that he had used words intended to insult her modesty on this occasion, in January 2014, and in August 2014. Her report made no mention of the Entrusted Monies and TSM’s alleged role in relation to them.

55     In a letter dated 24 February 2016, the police informed TSM that no further action would be taken against him in respect of Quah’s allegations.[^87]

### Company’s police report against Quah on 25 September 2014[^88]

56     On 25 September 2014, LEC lodged a police report against Quah (**P14**; the “Company’s Police Report”). This was in the following terms:

> On 20th June 2014, my manager, namely \[Quah\] has resigned and her last day was on 15th Sept 2014[^89]. Her main job scope is to handle the accounts, including issuing and receiving payments for the \[Company\]. As the handover of duties was not done properly by \[Quah\], we requested our auditor, \[the Audit Firm\], to send us the outstanding of the different companies we have business dealings with, so as to hand it over to the new accountant.

> When the outstanding was handed over, we discovered that there is an unaccounted amount and thus, we referred back to the auditor. We then requested the auditor to check through the audit records for the past 1 year. After checking through the accounts for the past 1 year, the auditor informed us that there is indeed some issue with the accounts. He also further informed that he \[had\] not seen this report before previously and only the person in charge of the accounts will be able to provide an explanation. After discovering the issue, we then tasked the auditor to check the records further back from July’11 to June’14, and he informed us that there is unaccounted amount of SGD$800,000. As such we consulted a lawyer and he advised us to lodge a police report.

> This is the first time such incident happened. I would like to state that \[Quah\] is the only one handling all the accounts in the \[Company\]. She has been working in the \[Company\] for the past 14 years. She mentioned that she would like to tender as she would like to move on to other opportunity.

> I would like to further add that we have yet to check through the audit records before year 2011 and am not sure if there is any more amount unaccounted for.

57     TSM had told LEC to lodge this report, as he had to attend a golf appointment with some business associates.[^90] TSM and NES had asked Fion to accompany LEC to lodge this report.[^91] TSM had asked Fion to follow LEC because LEC did not understand English. Fion could thus assist with any translation if the police officer did not speak Mandarin (there was no need for such translation in the end because the police officer who recorded the report was conversant in Mandarin). The Audit Firm had told the Directors to report the irregularities in the Company’s accounts to the police.[^92]

### Quah’s 2nd police report against TSM on 28 September 2014[^93]

58     On 28 September 2014, Quah lodged another police report against TSM (**D5**). In her report, she claimed that she had first “noticed that the cash/cheques collected were not accounted for and did not tally \[with\] the final sales” about three months after she started working for the Company. She alleged that TSM “would just brush it aside and…tell \[her\] that the proceeds would be split” among the Company’s directors whenever she raised this. She also claimed that TSM had started to accuse her of misusing the Company’s funds and not maintaining its accounts property after she lodged her first report.[^94] She enclosed a document[^95], typewritten in English, with further allegations.

### Letters to Clients on missing payments[^96]

59     The Company’s lawyers were M/s Lai Mun Onn & Co (the “Company’s lawyers”). Sometime in end-October 2014, they sent letters to each Client stating that the Company’s accounting records:

> …for the financial years ended 30 June 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 \[showed\] no records of payments made \[by the Client for its purchase of diesel from the Company…

60     These letters (individually, the “Inquiry Letter”, and collectively, the “Inquiry Letters”) then specified the sums for which there were “no records of payments made”. These sums appear in the following table:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="34.2331533693261%"> <col width="50.869826034793%"> <col width="14.8970205958808%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Client</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sum stated in Inquiry Letter</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Exhibit</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Tan Kok Chuan</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$27,089.91</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>P1</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Teo Tai Joo</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$40,369.07</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>P2</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ku Aik Beng</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$25,191.09</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>P3</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sin Koon Seng Enterprise</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$18,200.00</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>P4</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Time-Flex</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$131,266.09</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>P5</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">EDS (including Win Tran)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$731,904.78</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>P12</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

61     Each letter then asked the Client to provide the Company’s lawyers with evidence of payment (such as payment vouchers, receipts, cheque stubs or bank statements) for the Company’s “internal use in reconciling its accounts”.

62     Lee did not receive the Inquiry Letter. Time-Flex had already ceased operations in June 2013, and its Inquiry Letter was sent to its liquidator.[^97] Save for Lee, the rest of the Clients all spoke separately with TSM in the Office about these sums “for which there were no records of payments made”. I set out the relevant aspects of their evidence:

> (a)     TSM told Tan Kok Chuan that he owed the Company the sum stated in the Inquiry Letter. He responded by telling TSM that he had passed his payments to Quah every month, and TSM believed him.[^98]

> (b)     Teo Tai Joo was very surprised when TSM told him that he owed the Company the sum stated in the Inquiry Letter. However, TSM told him not to worry and said that he was only investigating.[^99]

> (c)     On receiving the Inquiry Letter, Ku Aik Beng called TSM and asked why it was sent. TSM replied that the sum of money stated in the letter was missing when he “counted the \[Company’s\] accounts”, and asked him to go to the Office. In the Office, TSM showed him “his record saying that \[he\] did not pay for that few months”. Ku responded that that was not possible. He also asked TSM if it was possible for him to owe so much money to the Company, and yet be allowed to continue pumping diesel at its premises. TSM replied that he believed Ku had paid. TSM also said that he suspected that this sum of money was missing, but he did not know why.[^100]

> (d)     When Tan Yong Tiong went to the Office, he asked TSM why the Company was going after him when he had never owed it any money. TSM “did not say much, he only said that these things…the secretaries are in charge”.[^101]

> (e)     During their discussion in the Office, Ho told TSM that he had already paid the Company the sum stated in the Inquiry Letter. He also explained to TSM that his vehicles would not have been able to refuel at the Company’s premises had he not made payment. When he showed TSM the EDS Audit Verification (to show TSM that he had already made payment until June 2013), TSM responded that he was not aware of the Company’s accounts. This was because he had always trusted Quah, who handled the Company’s accounts and administrative matters. Ho replied that TSM should ask Quah instead of him because he had always paid and did not owe the Company any money. The meeting concluded with TSM saying that he would leave the matter to the Company’s lawyers.[^102]

63     The Clients did not receive further letters from the Company or the Company’s lawyers following these Inquiry Letters.[^103]

### Letters to Quah on “serious financial irregularities”[^104]

64     Between November 2014 and January 2015, the Company’s lawyers sent three letters to Quah (collectively, the “Demand Letters”). These letters all bore the heading: “FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES IN ACCOUNTING RECORDS OF CHIN LIN BUS SERVICE (PTE) LTD”. The first letter (**D1**) was dated 28 November 2014. The relevant paragraphs in this letter read as follows:

> 3.    We are…instructed that you did not hand over the accounts properly to \[the Company\] upon your resignation….

> 4.    \[The Company\] subsequently discovered serious financial irregularities in the accounting records. They have appointed the \[Audit Firm\] to look into them.

> 5.    In their review of the accounting records for financial years ended 30 June 2010 to 2014, \[the Audit Firm concluded that\]:

>> (a)    Cash cheque payments received from EDS Enterprise were not banked into \[the Company’s Account\]. These entries were \[also\] not recorded in the accounting records.

>> (b)    Some of the invoices had been deliberately removed from the accounting records; and

>> (c)    They are unable to conclude from their review whether cash have been received and deposited \[into the Company’s Account\].

> 6.    In light of \[the\] findings and conclusions of \[the Audit\] Firm, and the fact that you were entrusted with the duty, responsibility and obligation to handle and manage the accounts, we are instructed as follows:

>> (a)    That you have the duty, responsibility and obligation to give a full and proper handover to \[the Company\] upon your resignation.

>> (b)    That you are required to give full and proper explanation of the financial irregularities uncovered by \[the Audit Firm\].

> 7.    In the circumstances, we are instructed to demand, and we HEREBY DEMAND AND DO DEMAND that you give full and proper explanation of the financial irregularities in the accounts, and particularly with reference to the following questions within fourteen (14) days from the date hereof:

>> (a)    Why cheque payments from M/s EDS Enterprise were not banked into \[the Company’s Account\]?

>> (b)    Why some of the invoices had been deliberately removed from the accounting records?

>> (c)    Why cash cheques were issued by customers, instead of cheques issued in the name of \[the Company\], for the payment of goods?

>> (d)    If cash cheques were issued by customers, were these banked into \[the Company’s Account\]?

>> (e)    Why were there no records of cash received and deposited into the \[Company’s Account\]?

> \[emphasis in original\]

65     The second letter (**D2**) was dated 17 December 2014. There, the Company’s lawyers noted that Quah had not given “any explanation or an account of the financial irregularities in \[the Company’s\] accounting records”. They also stated that a “preliminary investigation report provided by the \[Audit Firm\] ha\[d\] revealed financial irregularities in \[the Company’s\] accounting records in the sum of $974,020.94 from six (6) customers”. The letter then demanded that Quah “account for and/or pay \[this sum\] within \[14\] days…failing which \[the Company would\] commence legal action to recover the sum with interest and cost without further reference”.

66     The third letter was dated 19 January 2015 (**D3**). There, the Company’s lawyers noted that Quah had failed to respond to its previous letters. They then stated that they had been instructed “to commence legal action against \[her\] to recover the sum of S$974,020.94 or part thereof of such sums found due and payable to \[the Company\]”.

67     Quah ignored these letters.[^105]

68     At the time of trial, the Company had yet to commence any civil action.

### Admissibility of statements not disputed[^106]

69     Seven investigation statements were recorded from Quah by the Investigation Officer, Norazman bin Nordin (“the IO”)[^107], between 21 April 2015 and 2 January 2018. Before the IO recorded Quah’s first investigation statement (**AB20**), he asked her about the language she preferred to be examined in. He also informed her that he would enlist a Mandarin interpreter if she preferred to communicate in Mandarin. However, Quah informed him that her highest level of education was the GCE “A” Level, and indicated that she preferred to speak in English (these aspects were also recorded in the statement).

70     The IO also recorded five cautioned statements from Quah on 1 February 2018.[^108] When asked if she wished to say anything in response to the charges, she wrote that she “denied all \[the\] charges against \[her\]”. She also wrote that she had been acting on TSM’s instructions at all times, and that TSM had framed her.[^109]

71     Quah did not dispute the admissibility of all her statements. She accepted that they were recorded from her “voluntarily, without any threat, inducement or promise”.[^110]

### Entrusted Monies could not be traced/recovered

72     Although the IO tried to trace the Entrusted Monies through screenings of Quah’s personal bank accounts[^111], he was unable to do so. This was because Quah had withdrawn monies from her accounts in cash.[^112]

## Prosecution’s case**[^113]**

73     The Prosecution called the Clients; the Directors; Fion; Heng; the Special Auditor; and the IO, as its witnesses. Its case was that Quah had dishonestly misappropriated payments she received from the Clients in the form of cash or by way of cash cheques (_viz_., the Entrusted Monies). It contended that Quah did not hand _any_ of the Entrusted Monies to TSM. Neither did TSM authorise Quah to deal with the Entrusted Monies in the manner she did. The Prosecution averred that Quah had instead treated the Entrusted Monies as her own property. It further alleged that she had independently and unilaterally manipulated the Company’s accounts to conceal her misappropriation by:

> (a)     falsely debiting concluded sales transactions to the Company’s “OTHER INCOME” account. This suggested that concluded sales transactions with the Clients had been cancelled or voided, when they had not been.[^114]

> (b)     falsely debiting concluded sales transactions to the Company’s “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” account. This suggested that monies received from the Clients had been received by the Directors as loans, when they had not been.[^115]

## Close of Prosecution’s case

74     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found there was some evidence, not inherently incredible, that satisfied every element of the charges.[^116] I thus called on Quah to give evidence in her defence. She elected to testify, and did not call any other witness.

## Defence’s case**[^117]**

75     “The gist of \[Quah’s\] \[d\]efence \[was\] that she had no dishonest intention and she did not misappropriate any of the \[Company’s\] monies.” To this end, her counsel stated that Quah intended to rely on the following “facts”:

> (a)     Quah was, “\[a\]t all times”, “acting under \[TSM’s\] instructions”.

> (b)     TSM instructed Quah to collect payments from the Clients in cash or by way of cash cheques.

> (c)     “When \[Quah\] received **cash**, she would key in a record into the …ACCPAC accounting software.” “She would then handover the cash to \[TSM\].” In closing submissions, Quah’s counsel (“Counsel”) referred to this alleged practice as the “Cash Collection Practice”.[^118]

> (d)     “When \[Quah\] received **cash cheques**, she would also key in a record into the…ACCPAC accounting software.”

>> (i)       “Initially, she would then present the cash cheque and obtain cash over the counter at the bank and subsequently hand the cash over to \[TSM\].” In closing submissions, Counsel referred to this alleged practice as the “Encashing Practice”.[^119]

>> (ii)        Subsequently, on \[TSM’s\] instructions…she was told to deposit the cash cheques into her own bank accounts and then to withdraw the cash and to hand it over to \[TSM\] and she did so.” “She previously expressed her reservations about this practice to \[TSM\]. \[H\]owever, \[TSM\] told her that she should just do as she was \[t\]old and that the monies were a matter for him to deal with the other directors and shareholders of the \[Company\].”

76     TSM forcefully denied Quah’s case in his cross-examination:[^120]

> Q:    And so, if you knew that a customer…had paid in cash, the cash would have been handed over to you?

> **A:**      **Because I have said for small amounts, I would collect. For big amounts, \[Quah\] would take them to the bank. I do not know whether she really deposited them.**

> …

> Q:    And I put it to you when customers paid in cash, the cash will be handed over to you immediately by \[Quah\].

> **A:**      **I have already said for small amounts, she would hand over to me but for big amounts, she wouldn’t.**

> …

> Q:    And if the customer had made payment by way of a cheque issued to the company’s name, you would have checked the \[Company’s Account\] to make sure that the cheque cleared?

> **A:**      **That’s why I did not check. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had money missing.**

> Q:    And if it was a cash cheque, your instructions to \[Quah\], initially to present the cash cheque over the counter and take the cash immediately?

> **A:**      **There’s never been such thing.**

> Q:    And when she received that cash over the bank counter, she brought it back to the office and handed it to you immediately?

> **A:**      **There’s never been such a thing.**

> Q:    And once you received the cash, you would also record in your \[Cash Record Book\]?

> **A:**      **There has never been such thing.**

> Q:    And subsequently, you gave her instructions to deposit the cash cheque\[s\] into her account\[s\] and after that \[to\] withdraw the cash and give it to you?

> **A:**      **I have never know that there is such thing.**

> Q:    And in this scenario, once you receive the cash, you also recorded it in your \[Cash Record Book\]?

> **A:**      **There’s never been such a thing.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

## Applicable legal principles

77     I commence analysis by discussing applicable legal principles relating to:

> (a)     the elements of “dishonestly” and “misappropriates”, which must be satisfied to make out an offence under s 408 of the Penal Code; and

> (b)     circumstantial evidence.

### Meaning of “dishonestly misappropriates”

78     Section 408 of the Penal Code sets out the offence of criminal breach of trust by a servant. This section reads as follows:

> **Criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant**

> **408**.     Whoever, being a clerk or servant, or employed as a clerk or servant, and being in any manner entrusted in such capacity with property, or with any dominion over property, commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

> \[emphasis added by underlining\]

79     This offence is an aggravated form of criminal breach of trust[^121], which is defined in s 405 of the Penal Code in the following terms:

> **Criminal breach of trust**

> **405**.    Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property…dishonestly misappropriates…that property…commits “criminal breach of trust”.

> \[emphasis added by underlining\]

80     “\[T\]he conduct which the offence of \[criminal breach of trust\] prohibits is a situation where a person who lawfully possesses property belonging to another, in breach of directions or without authorisation, dishonestly misappropriates, converts to his own use, uses or disposes of that property”.[^122] Here, the only issue was whether Quah had dishonestly misappropriated the Entrusted Monies.[^123]

#### Meaning of “dishonestly”

81     The starting point in determining how “dishonesty”, an element of criminal breach of trust, should be established is its definition in s 24 the Penal Code.[^124] This section states that a person does a thing “dishonestly” if she does that thing “with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another person”. The terms “wrongful gain” and “wrongful loss” are defined in s 23 of the Penal Code:

> **“Wrongful gain” and “wrongful loss”**

> **23**.     “Wrongful gain” is gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled; “wrongful loss” is loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it is legally entitled.

> Explanation.—A person is said to gain wrongfully when such person retains wrongfully, as well as when such person acquires wrongfully. A person is said to lose wrongfully when such person is wrongfully kept out of any property, as well as when such person is wrongfully deprived of property.

> \[emphasis added by underlining\]

82     It is sufficient to prove an intention to cause either “wrongful gain” or “wrongful loss”. It is not necessary to prove intention with respect to both gain and loss”.[^125] The explanation to s 23 of the Penal Code also makes it clear that:[^126]

> …the Penal Code does not define “loss” in terms of financial or monetary loss, but in terms of legal entitlement. **A person would have “lost wrongfully” under the Penal Code if he was “kept out” or “deprived of” property to which he is legally entitled.** Thus, once property is put to an unlawful or unauthorised use, the property owner would be found to have “lost wrongfully” under the Penal Code…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

83     That said, “the mere fact that property has been put to an unauthorised use (_ie_, the presence of _actus reus_) does not make \[an\] accused guilty of the offence of \[criminal breach of trust\], even where the accused intended to perform the unauthorised act.…In order to establish the requisite dishonest _mens rea_ \[for the offence of criminal breach of trust\], the accused must know that the gain or loss was wrongful”.[^127] In _Ang Teck Hwa v Public Prosecutor_[^128], the High Court elaborated on the relevant dishonest _mens rea_:

> 36    …\[T\[o show dishonesty it must be shown that the \[accused\] intended to cause such wrongful gain or loss. **To intend a wrongful gain or loss requires that \[the accused\] knows the gain or loss is wrongful. Thus, if the \[accused\] made use of the \[money\] for his own purposes knowing that he was not entitled to do so, then he would be doing so with the intention of causing wrongful gain to himself and wrongful loss to \[the victim\].** Conversely, if the \[accused\] can show that he did so honestly believing that he was legally entitled to do, then he could not be said to have acted dishonestly.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

84     “\[P\]roof that the accused knew that wrongful loss or gain was very likely to result from \[her\] activities will be evidence from which the court may be able to infer that the accused intended to cause such gain or loss”.[^129]

#### Meaning of “misappropriates”

85     To “misappropriate” means to set apart or assign to the wrong person or wrong use, and this must be done dishonestly.[^130]

### Law on circumstantial evidence

86     There was no direct evidence showing that Quah dishonestly misappropriated the Entrusted Monies. The Prosecution’s case rested on circumstantial evidence. In this regard, I was aware that where the Prosecution relies wholly on circumstantial evidence, the totality of the evidence must lead the court “inevitably and inexorably” to conclude that the accused committed the offence.[^131] That said, the only principle applicable at the close of trial is whether the accused’s guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt – regardless of whether the evidence adduced by the Prosecution is direct or wholly circumstantial.[^132] In applying this principle, the court is:[^133]

> …**concerned with whether there is any other reasonably possible conclusion other than that the accused had committed the offence. The court is not concerned with “fanciful possibilit\[ies\]”:** _Nadasan Chandra Secharan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 118</span> at \[89\]. In _Miller v Minister of Pensions_ \[1947\] 2 All ER 372, Denning J, as he then was, pertinently stated at 373:

> **If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence “of course it is possible, but not in the least probable,” the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt**, but nothing short of that will suffice.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

87     Put another way: Where the evidence adduced by the Prosecution is wholly circumstantial, the question is whether there are alternative inferences that are reasonable, thereby raising the possibility that guilt has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.[^134] The burden on the Prosecution to prove all the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so proved. “It does not mean that every fact – every piece of evidence – relied upon to prove an element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt … Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.”[^135]

88     I also found commentary in _Ratanlal & Dhirajlal’s The Indian Penal Code_ useful. There, the authors discussed the drawing of inferences in relation to an intention to cause either “wrongful gain” or “wrongful loss” where entrustment is proved (or admitted, as was the case here):[^136]

> 2.     **Scope and object**…

> **In order to bring home the charge of criminal breach of trust** by a public servant, **there \[has\] to be an entrustment, thereafter misappropriation** or conversion to one’s own use or use in violation of any legal direction or of any legal contract **and finally the misappropriation** or conversation or disposal **must be with a dishonest intention. In order to be dishonest the property must be misappropriated or converted with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another, that is, with the intention to cause gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled or the loss by unlawful means of property of which the person losing it is legally entitled.** As such every offence of criminal breach of trust though it involves a civil wrong in respect of which the complainant may seek his redress for damages in a civil Court yet, every breach of trust in the absence of _mens rea_ or criminal intention cannot legally justify a criminal prosecution. **In short, intention is the gist of the offence.**

> 3.     **Essential of offence of Criminal Breach of Trust. – An offence of criminal breach of trust necessarily involves the facts of (a) entrustment of the property; and (b) a dishonest misappropriation** or conversion **of the property by the agent** to his own use**;** or (c) dishonest use or disposal of the property in violation of mandate of the law prescribing the mode in which the entrustment is to be discharged; or (d) dishonest use or disposal of the property in violation of the terms of any legal contract, either express or implied regarding the discharge of the entrustment or wilfully allowing some other person to do so. To establish a charge under the section, the fact of entrustment of the property as well as any or more of the other alternative as aforesaid have to be established by the prosecution, the gist being dishonest intention on the part of the agent. **The burden of proving such dishonest intention is on the prosecution, though however it being often difficult to get any direct evidence of intention, it may be justifiably inferred from the attending circumstances, the conduct of the accused and a false explanation given by him may also be an additional factor against him to be taken into consideration.**

> **If entrustment is proved and the accused fails to account for the property when he is accountable or is not able to offer an acceptable explanation for the loss the onus to establish which is upon him or offers a false explanation, a criminal intention may readily be inferred**, it must however be kept in mind that mere suspicion cannot take the place of proof and that **as long as the accused has offered a plausible explanation which in the background of the circumstances appears to be better probable, then he has discharged the onus upon him, the preponderance of probability being that his explanation might be true. Once the explanation of the accused appears to be so possible, the prosecution cannot be said to have established the case beyond all reasonable doubt since the accused has succeeded in raising a doubt through his explanation.** When such is the case, there is no offence under Section 409, I.P.C. even if entrustment is proved since in the absence of intention of conversion by the accused, a mere failure to account for the property would not be criminal breach of trust even though it might be otherwise a breach of trust. **It is therefore, for the prosecution to prove the explanation as false, if at all.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

## Decision on conviction

89     In arriving at my decision to convict Quah, I considered the three bases on which I could make a finding on a witness’s credibility:[^137]

> (a)     the witness’s demeanour;

> (b)     the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of the witness’s evidence; and

> (c)     the external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of the witness’s evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses and documentary evidence).

90     I was mindful of the dangers of relying excessively on the demeanour of witnesses and/or taking issue with their faulty recollections in assessing the veracity of their evidence. After all, the witnesses in this case were testifying between four and nine years after the offending period. It is the totality of the evidence that must be considered in determining the reliability and credibility of a particular witness’s evidence.[^138]

### Preliminary findings

91     I start with my preliminary findings on certain aspects.

#### Quah was proficient in the English language

92     Quah testified in Mandarin, through an interpreter. This was her right. But, it did not in itself mean that her proficiency in the English language was _in fact_ limited. Indeed, the evidence showed that her proficiency in the English language was not insignificant. This was in light of the following:

> (a)     All of her 12 statements were recorded in English, after she indicated that she wished to speak in English.[^139] In addition, the content in six (out of seven) of her investigation statements were of some length (see **AB20**; **AB21**; **AB23**; **AB24**; **AB25**; and **AB26**). She had also given the IO a rather lengthy document that _she_ had typewritten in English when her first statement was recorded.

> (b)     She agreed that:[^140]

>> (i)       she was, by far, the best educated employee in the Company; and

>> (ii)       her proficiency in the English language – in terms of reading; writing; and speaking – was far higher than that of the Directors.

> (c)     the operating system language of ACCPAC, which she had used since she joined the Company in 2000 to prepare its accounting records, was English.[^141]

> (d)     Her role in the Company required her to communicate, in English, with the Audit Firm and various statutory bodies (indeed, she testified there was “no need” for any interpretation when she did so).[^142]

> (e)     Her resignation letter was typewritten in English.[^143]

93     Quah’s proficiency in the English language was also evident during the trial. I noted _several_ instances where she replied confidently, in English, to the questions posed by the Prosecution and her counsel.[^144] On a number of these occasions, she had answered even though the questions posed had yet to be translated (or translated fully) for her. Her counsel also confirmed that she understood the contents of the Demand Letters (which were in English).[^145] Her exchange with the Prosecution during cross-examination was also illustrative. There, she admitted that she was more comfortable expressing herself in English (though she also attempted to downplay her proficiency):[^146]

> Q:    Now, Madam Quah, all of your police statements they were all recorded from you in English, correct?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **And that is in fact a language that you are proficient in, correct?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And in fact, the degree of proficiency that you have in English is that you are fluent in reading, writing, and speaking English, correct**?

> **A:**      **Yes.** But I am only a layman, my kind of English is different from that of a lawyer or from what they use in the police station. I’m only a layman.

> Q:    It was a very simple question Madam Quah. The question was that you are fluent in English, yes or no?

> A:    I can speak English but only ordinary English.

> **Q:**      **If you could go with me to AB20 at page 747? I’ll give you some time to look at pages 747 and 748. You wrote this letter, correct? So AB20 at pages 747 to pages 748.**

> **A:**      **Yes, I wrote this.**

> **Q:**      **You wrote this letter in English?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    So clearly you are fluent in writing English?

> A:    Although I’m an A-level student but I also use broken English when I speak and when I write.

> **Q:**      **But the point remains that you are able to sufficiently express yourself in English.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> …

> Q:    Madam Quah, you have fully accepted the admissibility of all of your police statements. This is not a disputed fact.

> A:    I accept that. But what I want to add is that my---my English is the very normal kind of English. I’m not like an---a lawyer or an investigator. The documents that are submitted, did the IO understand it?

> Q:    Madam Quah, this is the process of Cross-Examination, so I don’t think you should be asking me questions.

> A:    I’m sorry.

> **Q:**      **For all of these statements recorded from you by the police, it was your choice to speak in English, correct?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And really this is because you are more conformable expressing yourself in English, correct?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And in fact, this is quite aptly reflected in the fact that you keep lapsing into English in the course of giving your Evidence-in-Chief, right?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

#### Directors were not proficient in the English language

94     On the other hand, the evidence showed that the Directors were not proficient in the English language.

##### LEC’s lack of proficiency

95     LEC testified that his highest level of education was Primary 5. He was 76 years old when he testified. Born in June 1942, this meant that he would have been in Primary 5 in the early 1950s. When asked if he ever studied English in school, he said “\[t\]here was only 1 English textbook then, so very little. Because at that time, Chinese was emphasised”. He also said he was not able to speak English. Asked if he could read or write English, he replied, “I can understand ABC, but I cannot understand the whole sentence.”[^147] Quah did not challenge these aspects of LEC’s evidence.

96     LEC’s lack of proficiency in the English language was evident when he was referred to the audit verifications issued to him.[^148] He had appended his signature in the “Confirmation Reply” sections of both letters to (apparently) confirm that he owed the Company $56,495.92 and $61,231.15 as at 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014, respectively. However, this was at odds with the unchallenged evidence that he never borrowed money from the Company (and so did not owe the stated sums).[^149] Indeed, when asked if he could read any of the words on the audit verifications, he said that he was only able to read the dates; his name; his address; and the sums stated. He testified that he did not understand the rest of these letters.[^150]

97     I had closely observed LEC when he testified on these aspects and over the course of his testimony (as questions were posed to him in English and as he was referred to documents written in English). It was clear to me that he was unable to read and understand the contents of these audit verifications without interpretation. This was also his position when he was cross-examined on the FY2014 Report[^151] – on which he had signed to (apparently) confirm that the accompanying financial statements gave a “true and fair view of the state of affairs of the \[Company\] as at 30 June 2014”: [^152]

> Q:    When you signed off at page 2 \[of the FY2014 Report on behalf of the Directors\], did you look through the other pages in this document?

> **A:**      **I do not understand. How could I look through?**

> Q:    So did anyone explain it to you?

> A:    No. Nobody explained to me when I signed all these accounts….even for the annual returns.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

98     In any event, it was not Quah’s case that LEC could read and understand the audit verifications because he was proficient in the English language. Her case was that she had _informed_ LEC that these verifications referred to sums he owed to the Company.[^153]

##### NES’s lack of proficiency

99     NES testified that his highest level of education was Secondary 3. When asked if he had ever studied English in school, he said there was “\[o\]nly 1 textbook in the past for English”.[^154] NES was 73 years old when he testified. Born in October 1945, this meant that he would have been in Secondary 3 in the early 1960s. NES also testified that he could not speak English. When asked if he could then read or write English, he replied “I know my name, but most of them I do not understand”.[^155] Quah did not challenge these aspects of NES’s evidence.

100    NES’s lack of proficiency in the English language was evident when he was referred to the audit verifications issued to him.[^156] He had appended his signature in the “Confirmation Reply” sections of both letters to (apparently) confirm that he owed the Company $38,622.07 and $43,357.40 as at 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014, respectively. However, this was at odds with the unchallenged evidence that he never borrowed money from the Company (and so did not owe the stated sums).[^157] Indeed, when asked if he could read any of the words on the audit verifications, he said that he only knew his name. His testimony on the 2013 audit verification was telling:[^158]

> Q:    Now, Mr Neo, just take your time to look at the document, and after you’ve taken some time, please tell the Court if you are able to read any of the words on this document.

> A:    I only know my name.

> Q:    So, are you referring to the words “Neo Eng Seng” that appear under “Date, 20th August 2013”?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Any other words that you can recognise?

> **A:**      **I don’t understand. I have never read English.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

101    I had closely observed NES when he testified on these aspects and over the course of his testimony (as questions were posed to him in English and as he was referred to documents written in English). It was clear to me that he was unable to read and understand the contents of the audit verifications without interpretation.

##### TSM’s lack of proficiency

102    TSM testified that his highest level of education was Primary 3. This was also his level of English education, during which he “only had one \[English\] textbook”.[^159] TSM was 79 years old when he testified. Born in August 1939, this meant that he would have been in Primary 3 in the late 1940s or early 1950s. According to TSM, he was not able to read or write English. He also said that he was only able to speak “just a little bit”[^160] of English. Quah did not challenge TSM’s evidence on these aspects.

103    TSM’s lack of proficiency in the English language was evident when he was referred to the audit verifications issued to him.[^161] He had appended his signature in the “Confirmation Reply” sections of both letters to (apparently) confirm, respectively, that:

> (a)     the Company owed him $17,092.23 as at 30 June 2013; and

> (b)     he owed the Company $100,435.08 as at 30 June 2014, although it was not disputed that he never borrowed money from the Company (and so did not owe this sum).[^162]

104    Indeed, when asked if he could read any of the words on the audit verifications, he said that he only knew his name (apart from the signatures).[^163]

105    I had closely observed TSM when he testified on these aspects and over the course of his testimony (as questions were posed to him in English and as he was referred to documents written in English). It was clear to me that he was unable to read and understand the contents of the audit verifications without interpretation.

106    I found the conclusion of TSM’s evidence especially telling of his lack of proficiency in the English language. It was not disputed that the police had sent a letter to him to inform him that no further action would be taken against him in respect of Quah’s allegations of sexual misconduct.[^164] The Prosecution adduced a copy of this letter[^165] during his re-examination. In further cross-examination, Counsel then asked TSM how he knew about the contents of this letter (which were in English). TSM explained that he had to enlist the assistance of his lawyer. Counsel then asked TSM if he knew what the contents of the letter were about when he first saw the letter. TSM’s response was direct and immediate: “I do not understand English, how could I know?” The relevant extract from the notes of evidence appears below:[^166]

> Q:    Okay. Mr. Tan, following up from P25. This letter was sent to your home address, was it?

> A:    I think so as stated here.

> Q:    Okay. So you can recognise your address there?

> A:    I’m residing here in Bishan.

> Q:    So my questions is, do you recognise your address that is stated there?

> A:    Yes, I know. I’m residing at this place. How could I not know?

> **Q:**      **With respect to the contents of the letter when you received it, how did you know what the letter was about?**

> **A:**      **I showed to my lawyer.**

> **Q:**      **And then your lawyer explained it to you?**

> **A:**      **My lawyer explained to me that nothing will happen to me after the investigation.** So this is a letter from the government, telling me that nothing will happen after the investigation.

> Q:    Okay, let’s clarify. So when you received this letter it will have come in an envelope, right?

> A:    Of course. When it sent to me there would definitely be an envelope.

> **Q:**      **So when you open up the envelope and you saw this letter, did you know that the police was saying that they have decided not to take further action against you?**

> **A:**      **I do not understand English, how could I know?**

> DC:    No further questions, Your Honour.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

#### Directors did not know how to use computers or ACCPAC

107    The Directors all testified that they did not even know how to turn on a computer or how to use ACCPAC.[^167] TSM also gave unchallenged evidence that he did not even know what information was recorded on ACCPAC. I set out TSM’s evidence below:

> Q:    It’s undisputed that Chin Lin uses an accounting software named ACCPAC. Who purchased ACCPAC for Chin Lin?

> A:    ‘Mabel’.

> Q:    Do you know who trained ‘Mabel’ to use ACCPAC?

> A:    She said that she’s very clear on ACCPAC.

> Q:    So, to clarify, you don’t know who if anyone trained ‘Mabel’ to use ACCPAC?

> A:    I do not know.

> **Q:**      **Do you know how to use ACCPAC?**

> **A:**      **I do not know.**

> Q:    Do you know what information ACCPAC records?

> A:    Initially we did not use ACCPAC. Later ‘Mabel’ said that we must use ACCPAC. She knows ACCPAC very well, so she knows what to do.

> **Q:**      **So, coming back to my question Mr. Tan, do you know what information ACCPAC records?**

> **A:**      **I do not know, I only know that all the accounts could be inside.**

> **Q:**      **So, do you double check ‘Mabel’s’ entries on ACCPAC?**

> **A:**      **I do not know how to. How could I check?**

> **Q:**      **Do you know how to use a computer?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

108    In addition, it was Fion’s unchallenged evidence that:[^168]

> (a)     she never saw LEC, NES, or TSM operate a computer; and

> (b)     to the best of her knowledge, LEC, NES, and TSM did not know how to turn on a computer or how to use ACCPAC.

109    When cross-examined by the Prosecution, Quah agreed that LEC and NES did not know how to turn on a computer or how to use ACCPAC. However, she claimed – for the _first_ time – that TSM knew how to turn on a computer and “knew \[how to use ACCPAC\] a little bit”. According to Quah, TSM needed to know how to turn on the computer when no one was around and she had given him her password to “go in to see the general ledger matters.” None of this was raised during Counsel’s cross-examination of TSM. Indeed, Quah struggled to explain why she did not challenge his evidence: [^169]

> Q:    …Now, I asked you, I said, in fact, Lim Eng Chuan, Neo Eng Seng, Tan Song Mong did not know how to use ACCPAC. And your answer was Mr Lim, Mr Neo, Mr Ong did not know but Mr Tan knew a little bit. Yes, I’m just repeating your answer to you.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    But, in fact, you agreed that Mr Lim, Mr Neo, Mr Tan, they don’t even know how to turn on the computer.

> A:    Mr Tan knew a little bit. He would---he would need to know how to switch on the computer because if all of us are not around, he would need to enter into the computer. I would give him my password and he would need to go in to see the general ledger matters.

> Q:    Okay, Mdm. Quah, you didn’t answer the rest of my question. So you agree Mr Lim, Mr Neo, don’t know how to turn on the computer?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Only Mr Tan, apparently, knows, a little bit, how to turn on the computer.

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **This is despite the fact that he testified in Court that he doesn’t know how to turn on the computer.**

> **A:**      **I do not know how to describe.**

> Q:    Well, it’s either that Mr. Tan knows…how to turn on a computer or he doesn’t know.

> A:    He…knows.

> Q:    …So your answer is he knows?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **This was despite the fact that his evidence was unchallenged in Court that he does not know.**

> **A:**      **No, but…Mr Tan likes to say he doesn’t know.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

110    I rejected Quah’s belated evidence. Her fresh assertions in cross-examination were never put to TSM. She also failed to challenge Fion’s evidence. In my view, the evidence showed that the Directors (including TSM) did not even know how to turn on a computer or how to use ACCPAC.

#### LEC’s limited awareness of Company’s affairs

111    LEC had been a director of the Company since it started operating in 1974.[^170] That said, the evidence showed that his involvement in, and knowledge of, its affairs were very limited (notwithstanding its small size). His demeanour as he testified also revealed his cluelessness about many aspects of the Company’s affairs. Indeed, when asked to describe his job in the Company, he replied that he was “doing odd jobs in the \[Company\] and selling some diesel.”[^171] When then asked to elaborate on his responsibilities as a director, he responded as follows: “In the past, I repair\[ed\] vehicles…now I only help to sell oil and sometimes to do some repairs.”[^172]

112    LEC was aware that Quah was in charge of the Company’s accounts and that she informed its customers how much they owed the Company.[^173] However, he knew little else about her. He was not sure who hired her, as he “was not involved in the \[Company’s\] affairs”.[^174] He did not know her salary when she joined the Company, because he “wasn’t even paying attention to those matters.”[^175] When asked if he knew of her last drawn salary, he replied, “I do not know about her salary at all”.[^176] Indeed, he was not even sure if she reported to TSM:[^177]

> Q:    And who does \[Quah\] report to?

> A:    I **think** it was \[TSM\].

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

113    LEC’s awareness of the Company’s financial affairs was no better. In fact, he testified that he was not involved in the Company’s financial matters.[^178] He knew that its customers paid in cash or by way of cheques.[^179] However, he did not know if _cash_ cheques were an acceptable mode of payment because he was “not in charge of this”.[^180] He said that Quah kept track of whether customers paid. But, he was not sure if TSM did so as well. In any event, he said that he “did not really care about this” as he believed that TSM was in charge:[^181]

> Q:    And how then does \[the Company\] keep track of whether clients have paid for the diesel?

> A:    \[Quah\] will track.

> Q:    And apart from \[Quah\] tracking, are there any other forms of checks?

> A:     **No. I do not know** if \[TSM\] is managing this. **I believe** that \[TSM\] is in charge.

> Q:    Okay.

> **A:**      **So I did not really care about this.**

> \[emphasis in bold\]

114    LEC said that he never asked about the bank statements for the Company’s Account because he was “not involved in this.”[^182] Neither did he keep track of these statements. He only discovered there were issues with the Company’s accounts _after_ TSM told him that Quah’s replacement was not able to balance the accounts.[^183]

115    LEC’s limited awareness of the Company’s financial affairs and the significant amount of trust he reposed in Quah were clear when he was referred to the 2014 audit verification.[^184] This had stated that the Company’s records showed that he owed the Company $61,231.15 as at 30 June 2014 – although it was not disputed that LEC had never borrowed any money from the Company (and so did not owe the sum stated).[^185] That said, he had appended his signature in the “Confirmation Reply” section of the letter to (apparently) confirm the correctness of the sum he allegedly owed the Company. In examination-in-chief, he testified that Quah had (only) told him that the document was for filing the accounts when she gave it to him to sign.[^186] He repeated this evidence when cross-examined. However, he also testified that he would simply just sign off “whatever documents for the filing of accounts that were given to \[him\]”:[^187]

> Q:    Okay Mr Lim, can you now pick up P16? P16 is a letter dated 7th of August 2014 that was addressed to you. Okay. If you look at the section with the title “Confirmation Reply”, do you see just beside it, there seems to be a signature or an initial? Or to be fair to you, there appears to be some handwritten note.

> A:    Yes, it’s a handwritten note.

> Q:    Do you know who wrote it?

> A:    I do not know.

> Q:    So, when you signed off on this confirmation reply, that handwritten note wasn’t there?

> A:    I did not pay attention to this. When I signed these documents, I seldom pay attention to all these.

> …

> Q:    Okay but, Mr Lim, earlier in your evidence, you said that ‘Mabel”…gave you this document to sign, and she said that it was to file the accounts, right?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So you knew when you signed this, it was for purposes of filing the accounts?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **Okay so, it’s actually quite an important document, right?**

> **A:**      **I do not know about this.**

> Q:    Okay, Mr Lim, you are a director of the \[C\]ompany.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Since 1974, right?

> A:    I think so. When the \[C\]ompany started, I was already a director.

> **Q:**      **Okay, Mr Lim. So, my point really is that, if you weren’t sure about what this document is, you shouldn’t have signed it, right?**

> **A:**      **Because all along, we trusted our clerk, \[Quah\].**

> Q:    Okay, but even before \[Quah\] came in, you would have had another accountant, right?

> A:    Another clerk, yes. Yes, we had.

> **Q:**      **Okay, and also when documents that were prepared for the filing of accounts, you would also just sign it?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    When you signed this document marked P16, if you see somewhere in the middle of the page, there are 2 signatures, right?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **Okay, were the 2 signatures there when you signed off?**

> **A:**      **I did not pay attention.**

> **Q:**      **Okay, Mr Lim. I’m going to put it to you, okay, that whatever documents for the filing of accounts that were given to you, you simply just signed off.**

> **A:**      **I agree.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

116    LEC testified similarly when referred to the 2014 audit verification issued to TSM. This had stated that the Company’s records showed that TSM owed the Company $100,435.08 as at 30 June 2014. According to LEC, “\[t\]here was totally no explanation” of this document when Quah gave it to him to sign.[^188] He also said that he did not know the purpose of this document when he signed it. Neither did he know that that TSM owed the Company $100,435.08 as at 30 June 2014. Notwithstanding all of these, he still appended his signature as “Director” to inform TSM of this debt owed to the Company.

117    LEC’s evidence in respect of the FY2014 Report[^189] was also telling.[^190] In examination-in-chief, he had testified that he did not receive any director’s fees or shareholder dividends between 2009 and 2014. According to LEC, he had only received director’s fees in 2017 and 2018.[^191] In cross-examination, his attention was then drawn to the last page of the report – which stated that $48,000 had been paid out for “Directors’ fee” for the financial year ending on 30 June 2014. In this regard, he testified that he had not received _any_ part of this sum. He also said that he did not know if TSM or NES had.[^192] Indeed, he testified that he had simply signed on the report without looking at it because he had left it to the auditors to do their work:[^193]

> Q:    Okay. What I’m trying to ask is that, earlier you said you didn’t receive any director’s fees from 2009 to 2014, but there audited accounts shows that director’s fees were paid out. So, did you receive any part of this 48,000?

> A:    No.

> **Q:**      **Did any other director receive this sum?**

> **A:**      **I do not know about this.**

> **Q:**      **Okay, so you are saying that some director’s fees could have been paid out but not paid out to you?**

> **A:**      **These accounts is done by \[the Audit Firm\], I’m not sure.**

> **Q:**      **So again, Mr Lim, you are saying that you signed off on these audited accounts…but left it to the auditors to do that work, is it?**

> **A:**      **Yes, I did not look at it.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

118    LEC testified that he knew that TSM loaned money to the Company to tide it over financial difficulties. However, he did not know when this practice started. He was also not sure how much money TSM had lent the Company and the number of occasions he had done so. In addition, he was not sure if the Company had already repaid TSM. He further said that he did not know if TSM was still lending money to the Company because he “\[did\] not care about the accounts”.[^194]

119    In cross-examination, LEC was referred to the Inquiry Letters. His testimony showed that he was not even aware of who the Company’s lawyers were. He even asked Counsel to clarify if the Company’s lawyers were in fact its lawyers, before going on to say that he had never seen these letters:[^195]

> Q:    Okay Mr Lim, we have \[the Inquiry Letter addressed to Tan Kok Chuan\]. Okay, and it’s under the letterhead of “Lai Mun Onn and Company”.

> **A:**      **What is this company? I do not know.**

> Q:    Okay, so you do not know who Lai Mun Onn and Company is?

> **A:**      **I do not know.**

> …

> Q:    Okay, now, if you look at \[the Inquiry Letter addressed to Teo Tai Joo\], under Lai Mun Onn and Co’s letterhead.

> **A:**      **Is the---is Lai Mun Onn our lawyers?**

> Q:    Mr Lim, I think you have to tell us that.

> **A:**      **I do not know much about…these letters.**

> Q:    Okay…if you look through \[the Inquiry Letters addressed to the Clients\], you are saying that you have never seen these letters before?

> **A:**      **I have never seen \[them\].**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

120    It was also LEC’s evidence that he had never seen the Demand Letters. He also did not know if they were ever sent to Quah.[^196]

#### NES’s limited awareness of Company’s affairs

121    The evidence also showed that NES’s involvement in, and knowledge of, the Company’s affairs were very limited (notwithstanding its small size). Like LEC, NES’s demeanour as he testified showed that he knew very little about the Company’s affairs. Indeed, when asked about his responsibilities as a director, he replied: to “take care of the oil”, “take care of the oil pumping area, and to clean up the place”.[^197]

122    NES did not know when Quah joined the Company and who hired her. He also said that he did not oversee Quah’s work. He was not aware of her job scope as well.[^198]

123    NES was aware that customers paid in cash or by way of cheques. However, he did not know who stipulated these modes of payment. He also did not know what Quah was supposed to do with the cash and cheques she collected from customers.[^199] When asked how the Company kept track of whether its customers paid, he replied, “I do not know. All were handled by \[Quah\]”.[^200] He also could not recall if he ever saw the bank statements for the Company’s Account.[^201] When asked about his involvement in the Company’s financial affairs, he responded: “I do not know about those”.[^202]

124    NES said that he knew that TSM loaned the Company money, but he explained that this was because TSM had said he did. When asked why TSM did so, NES replied “\[TSM is\] in charge of the money. He is the boss”. However, he did not know how much money TSM had loaned the Company.[^203] He also did not know if the Company had already repaid TSM.

125    NES testified that TSM was in charge of managing the Company’s “internal affairs”. That said, when asked what he meant by “internal affairs”, he simply responded that TSM was “in charge of the internal jobs”. It was not at all clear what “internal affairs’ or “internal jobs” meant. NES was not able to elaborate further.

126    In cross-examination, NES was referred to the Inquiry Letters and the Demand Letters.. Like LEC, he testified that he:[^204]

> (a)     had never seen these letters before;

> (b)     was not aware if the Demand Letters were ever sent to Quah; and

> (c)     did not know that M/s Lai Mun Onn & Co were the Company’s lawyers.

#### LEC & NES relied on TSM to handle Company’s affairs

127    LEC’s and NES’s limited involvement in the Company’s affairs were supported by their consistent references to TSM as their “boss”[^205] – although they were _all_ directors. In cross-examination, LEC was asked why he referred to TSM as his “boss” when they were _both_ directors. He agreed that he did so because, as far as he was concerned, TSM “was handling the \[Company’s\] affairs on behalf of all the directors”:[^206]

> Q:    Okay, Mr Lim, you and \[TSM\] are both directors of the company, right?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **Okay, why do you refer to him as your boss?**

> **A:**      **Usually, I would address him as so, because he is the one who handles everything.**

> **Q:**      **So, am I right to say that as far as you are concerned, \[TSM\] was handling the affairs of the company on behalf of all the directors?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    Okay, and for you, you were just concerned about whether the company was making money or not?

> A:    Yah, it should be like this, **as long as I have money to take. That’s all.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

128    In closing submissions, Counsel argued that there was “no doubt in \[LEC’s and NES’s\] minds that TSM exercised complete control over \[Quah’s\] duties as an employee”.[^207] It was also contended that “it was evident that \[Quah\] reported to TSM, and TSM did supervise her”.[^208] I did not find these submissions persuasive. The evidence showed that LEC and NES knew very little about the Company’s affairs. They also did not know much about Quah’s and TSM’s duties in the Company. LEC, in particular, was not sure if Quah reported to TSM and if TSM was the one in charge of keeping track of whether customers paid. Indeed, LEC candidly admitted that he was only concerned with whether the Company made money.[^209] LEC and NES did not therefore appear to be in any position to comment on whether TSM exercised “complete control” or supervision over Quah’s duties. They effectively relied on TSM to handle the Company’s affairs (but this did not in itself mean that TSM did _in fact_ handle these affairs).

#### TSM relied on Quah to handle Company’s accounts

129    TSM testified that Quah was “in charge of everything” relating to the Company’s accounts between 2009 and 2014:[^210]

> Q:    …Who else, if anyone, worked with \[Quah\] on \[the Company’s\] accounts between 2009 and 2014?

> **A:**      **No, she take over everything and she was in charge of everything.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

130    When asked as to whom Quah reported to in the Company, TSM said that she “_should_ report to \[him\]”. According to TSM, Quah did “\[i\]nitially \[report to him\] for a few years.” He also oversaw her work initially “for quite some years”. But, he “just let her do her work” “after 7 to 8 years” after he underwent surgery for heart problems. He also thought that she “was quite good after working for \[him\] for a few years”.[^211]

#### Quah did not explain audit verifications to Directors

131    The Directors all testified[^212] that they had never borrowed money from the Company. Quah did not challenge this aspect of their evidence. Indeed, she agreed in cross-examination that they had never borrowed money from the Company.[^213]

132    Quah was then referred to the audit verifications issued to LEC and NES in 2013 and 2014.[^214] These had stated that LEC and NES owed money to the Company (and so suggested that they had indeed borrowed money from the Company). But, she disagreed that these verifications contradicted her evidence that the Directors had never borrowed money from the Company. Instead, she claimed – for the _firs_t time – that the figures in these letters referred to monies “accumulated from the past”.[^215] In re-examination, she testified that the sum stated in the verification issued to NES in 2013 related to money that NES owed the Company before 2009. According to Quah, NES had not returned money to the Company after selling a vehicle the Company had bought him. She claimed that TSM wanted to use the verification to prove that NES had not repaid the Company. This also appeared to be her position on the verifications issued to LEC in 2013 and 2014, as well as the verification issued to NES in 2014.[^216]

133    I rejected Quah’s fresh claims. They were not raised when the Directors testified. She also failed to explain the sums on the verifications issued to TSM in 2013 and 2014.

134    Since the Directors never borrowed money from the Company, it would have made no sense for them to sign the verifications _if_ they knew that these letters:

> (a)     stated that they owed money to the Company;[^217] and

> (b)     required their confirmation that they did indeed owe large sums of money to the Company (ranging from $43,357.40 to $100,435.08).

135    Quah must therefore have failed to explain the contents of these verifications to the Directors when she asked the Directors to sign them. This was in fact the Directors’ evidence as well.[^218] They all testified that they did not understand the substantive contents of the verifications that Quah had given them to sign.[^219] They also said that they did not owe the Company the sums stated in these letters.[^220]

136    In particular, LEC testified that Quah did not tell him that the verifications issued to him stated that he owed money to the Company. According to LEC, Quah had only told him that they were needed for filing the Company’s accounts.[^221] This was also TSM’s evidence in relation to the verification issued to him in 2014:[^222]

> Q:    And what did \[Quah\] explain to you about this document when she asked you to sign it?

> **A:**      **She only said that it was required by Heng Lee Seng for the accounts and then we would have to sign.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

137    NES’s evidence in cross-examination was also relevant. This was because he had also signed on the verifications issued to LEC to confirm that LEC did indeed owe the sums stated to the Company. I set out the relevant portions of NES’s evidence:[^223]

> Q:    So, can you recall who gave you \[the audit verification issued to LEC in 2013\] to sign?

> A:    \[Quah\].

> **Q:**      **And when you signed this document, were you told \[by Quah\] what it was for?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **And did you ask her?**

> **A:**      **No. When she took it to me and asked \[me\] to sign, \[I\] signed.**

> …

> Q:    Okay. Okay, my instructions are that when \[Quah\] gave this document to you to sign, she did tell you that it states that there is an amount owing by \[LEC\] to the company.

> **A:**      **No, she did not say. She did not say.**

> Q:    Okay, can you now look at \[the audit verification issued to LEC in 2014\]?...Okay do you see your signature appearing in the middle of the document.

> A:    Yes.

> …

> Q:    Okay. So, who gave you this document to sign?

> A:    \[Quah\].

> …

> **Q:**      **Can you recall what \[Quah\] told you regarding this document?**

> **A:**      **She did not say.**

> **Q:**      **So you simply just signed it?**

> **A:**      **Yes. Yes, when she took it to me, I would sign.**

> **Q:**      **Did you ever ask why you had to sign these 2 documents?**

> **A:**      **No, I did not.**

> Q:    And do you know who prepared these documents?

> A:    She brought it to me and I signed, how would I know who prepared the\[m\]?

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

138    TSM’s evidence in cross-examination was relevant as well. Like NES, he had signed the verification issued to LEC in 2014. When asked if Quah had explained the purpose of this document when he signed it, TSM testified as follows:[^224]

> A:    Usually when \[Quah\] asked us to sign something, if it’s not for tax purposes it will be what the government requires or for the accounts then we would sign for her. **We do not know anything about English at all so whatever she said we will sign.**

> Q:    But, Mr Tan, like I said, you’ve been a director since 1974. You are signing documents without finding out what the content of the document is?

> **A:**      **She just said “You sign this, I will not harm you.” So she asked me to sign, I will sign. This is what is required by the government and required by income tax, so we would sign.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

139    NES similarly testified that he had signed the verifications issued to him because Quah had asked him to.[^225]

#### Directors trusted Quah when signing audit verifications

140    The significant amount of trust reposed in Quah by the Directors was evident from the audit verifications. The evidence showed that the Directors all signed these letters without question – although:[^226]

> (a)     their proficiency in the English language (the language used in these letters) was very limited;

> (b)     they did not know how to use ACCPAC (and so were not able to independently access the Company’s accounting records to verify the figures stated in these letters); and

> (c)     Quah did not explain their contents and implications.

141    This was also supported by LEC’s and TSM’s testimony. In cross-examination, LEC was asked why he signed the verification issued to him in 2014 when he was not sure of its import. He explained that he did so because he trusted Quah:[^227]

> Q:    Okay, Mr Lim. So, my point really is that, if you weren’t sure about what this document is, you shouldn’t have signed it, right?

> **A:**      **Because all along, we trusted our clerk, \[Quah\].**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

142    TSM also explained that he did not ask Quah about the verification issued to him in 2013 because he trusted her:[^228]

> Q:    Did you ask \[Quah\] about this document which you had to sign?

> A:    I did not ask her.

> Q:    Why not?

> **A:**      **Because when I employed her to do this, I would trust her.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

143    The amount of trust that TSM reposed in Quah was especially clear when he was asked about the audit verification issued to EDS in 2013.[^229] It was TSM’s evidence that Quah had written the contents of the letter. She had told him that EDS “owed \[the Company\] money for too long and…she wanted to demand payment."[^230] He was then asked if he therefore accepted that EDS owed the Company $26,309.98 as at 30 June 2013. He testified as follows:[^231]

> **A:**      **\[It was Quah\] who told me this, of course I believe my employee.**

> Q:    Okay. So if you didn’t agree with it, you wouldn’t have signed it right?

> **A:**      **I trusted her. Whatever amount she said, I would sign. If I do not trust her, I wouldn’t have employed her.**

> Q:    Mr Tan, in fact, I put it to you that you had signed it because you knew that that was the amount that EDS Enterprise owed the company.

> **A:**      **I do not know how much was owing by the company. \[Quah\] prepared this so I have to trust her. She’s my employee. I have to trust her.**

> Q:    Mr Tan, I put it to you that you also knew how much EDS Enterprise owed the company because you were keeping track of customer payments every month.

> A:    But if she cancel it, I would have thought that it was repaid…so I would just look at this piece of paper by her because if she was to cancel the 3 months payment and change it to 1 month, I also wouldn’t have known.

> Q:    Okay, Mr Tan, on this point I would put it to you that you would have known know much EDS Enterprise has paid to the company because you were keeping track of payments from customers.

> A:    I disagree.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

#### Discussion between Directors & Quah before Quah’s resignation

144    In examination-in-chief, LEC testified that TSM had called for a discussion in the Office before Quah’s resignation in June 2014 (the “June 2014 Discussion”). This was because the business was not doing well. According to LEC, “every time when the business \[was\] not good, when we did not earn any money, we \[would\] be asked to come and discuss”. Quah and the Directors were present at this discussion. During the discussion, LEC asked why the Company was not making money. Quah then said “I don’t want to do anymore”, and told the Directors that she would resign. LEC then told Quah that if she really wanted to resign, she should write a letter (as he had told her “many times already” on previous occasions). According to LEC, Quah did not give any reasons for wanting to resign. TSM also “did not say much” at this discussion. No reasons were identified during this discussion as to why the Company was not making any money.[^232] It was LEC’s evidence that this discussion did not yield any conclusion. In cross-examination, LEC disagreed that the June 2014 Discussion never happened.[^233]

145    In a similar vein, NES testified that there was a meeting in the Office before Quah resigned in June 2014.. Quah and the Directors were present at this meeting, where the Company’s financial performance was discussed. During the meeting, Quah “said that there was no money”. She also said that “she did not want to do anymore”, to which LEC then asked her to write a letter if she really wanted to resign. According to NES, Quah did not give any reasons for wanting to resign. He also said that nothing much else was discussed at this meeting.[^234] NES’s evidence was not challenged in cross-examination.

146    TSM also testified that Quah would frequently say, “If you don’t trust me, I will resign”[^235] when the Directors asked her why the Company was not making money. Recalling the June 2014 Discussion, he said that LEC had told her to write a letter if she really wanted to resign. TSM’s evidence was not challenged in cross-examination.

147    I found that the June 2014 Discussion _did_ happen. During this discussion, Quah was asked why the Company was not making money. She responded by saying that she did not want to continue working at the Company, and did not explain why. LEC then told her that she should write a letter if she really did want to resign. This explained Quah’s resignation letter, dated 20 June 2014.[^236]

### Totality of evidence showed that Quah committed offences

148    Against the backdrop of my preliminary findings, I found that the totality of the evidence showed “inevitably and inexorably” that Quah dishonestly misappropriated the Entrusted Monies. I now elaborate.

#### Inherent deficiencies in Quah’s Compilation

149    To support her case, Quah prepared spreadsheets and produced them during her examination-in-chief (**D13A**; collectively, “the Compilation”). She said she prepared the Compilation to prove that she did not take the Entrusted Monies.[^237] It was her evidence that the Compilation made it easier to see how she withdrew the “cash cheques \[that she\] deposited into \[her three personal bank accounts\], to be given to \[TSM\]”.[^238] Quah had obtained the details listed in her Compilation from the bank statements of these three accounts.[^239] These details comprised:

> (a)     the account numbers;

> (b)     various sums ranging from $500 to $15,000, that Quah had withdrawn from each of her three accounts[^240]; and

> (c)     the dates and months of these withdrawals.

150    According to Quah, the withdrawals listed in her Compilation all pertained to the cash cheques she had collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex, which she had encashed by depositing into her personal accounts. It was her case that the Compilation showed that she withdrew a total of $451,400 from her accounts between 2 January 2010 and 16 August 2014. She claimed that she handed this entire sum to TSM on different occasions, and that TSM would record the sums given on each occasion in his Cash Record Book.[^241] That said, she agreed in cross-examination that her Compilation was deficient in the following aspects:[^242]

> (a)     it related only to her explanation for what happened to _some_ (and not all)[^243] of the cash cheques she had collected from EDS; Win Tran; and Time-Flex.

> (b)     it contained _no_ record of the payments she had collected from:

>> (i)       Tan Kok Chuan;

>> (ii)       Teo Tai Joo;

>> (iii)       Ku Aik Beng; and

>> (iv)       Sin Koon Seng Enterprise.

> (c)     it did not explain the difference of $468,421.69, between the:[^244]

>> (i)       total sum she had admitted to collecting from the Clients ($919,821.69, as reflected in the charges); and

>> (ii)       total sum of $451,400 stated in the Compilation.

> (d)     the withdrawals she listed in the Compilation did not correlate to the amounts stated on the cash cheques she deposited into her personal accounts. As Quah testified: “\[I\]f I deposited $10,000 of cash cheques into the account, it \[did\] not mean that I would withdraw $10,000…Sometimes \[it\] will be more, sometimes \[it\] will be less”.[^245]

151    In itself, the Compilation also did not show that Quah did _in fact_ hand a total of $451,400 to TSM.[^246] It was but a summation of selected withdrawals that Quah had made from her personal accounts. It did not therefore advance her case very much. Indeed, her cross-examination on the Compilation undermined her case severely.

#### Quah kept monies from cash cheques she encashed

152    In cross-examination, Quah agreed that her stance on the cash cheques she had collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex comprised only four steps:[^247]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="11.46%"> <col width="88.54%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Step 1</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">She collected these cash cheques.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Step 2</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">She deposited <b>all</b> of these cash cheques into her three personal bank accounts, as reflected in her Compilation.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Step 3</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">She withdrew <b>all</b> of the monies corresponding to these cash cheques from her three personal bank accounts.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Step 4</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">She handed <b>all</b> of the monies she withdrew to TSM.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

153    Before this, Quah had agreed that _all_ of the payments she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex belonged to the Company. She also agreed that she should therefore withdraw the _full_ sum corresponding to the cash cheques from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex. This was because she was not allowed to keep _any_ of the monies from _any_ cash cheque for her personal use. I set out her evidence on these aspects:[^248]

> Q:    Now, I want you to focus again on \[your Compilation\]…Now you explained that \[your Compilation\] allegedly only relates to cash cheques from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex, agree?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **Now, you agree that any cash cheques that these 3 companies give to you for diesel payment actually belong\[s\] to \[the Company\], agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    And you have explained according to you that you banked these cash cheques into your personal bank accounts and you withdraw the money and you handed to \[TSM\], agree?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **And because these cash cheques actually belong to \[the Company\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **When you withdraw the in-cash sum, you should withdraw the entire amount corresponding to the cheque, correct?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **Because you are not allowed to keep any of the money relating to those cash cheques for your personal use, agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

154    The withdrawals that Quah listed in her Compilation _only_ comprised four round figures: $500; $800, $1,000; and $15,000.[^249] But, _none_ of the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex were for these round figures. In fact, the _majority_ of the cash cheques she collected were _not_ for round figures.[^250] Quah’s Compilation therefore contradicted her stance on the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex[^251] (because the withdrawals she listed in her Compilation _did not match_ the sums stated on the cash cheques she deposited into her three personal accounts). Indeed, the Compilation showed that Quah _never_ withdrew the full sum corresponding to _any_ of the cash cheques she deposited into her personal accounts.

155    To explain away this glaring discrepancy (which showed, at the very least, that she kept part of the monies from the cash cheques she deposited into her personal accounts), Quah made numerous fresh claims when confronted during cross-examination. The belated nature of her claims (all of which were material to her defence, and which should have been raised during the cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses and in her own evidence-in-chief) undermined her credibility severely. It also concurrently undercut her defence that she had been acting under TSM’s instructions at all times. I now set out _some_ of these claims – which were clearly afterthoughts.

##### Quah’s many fresh claims to account for a single cash cheque

156    In cross-examination, the Prosecution showed Quah the image of a cash cheque she had collected from Win Tran (**P7**). Dated 31 October 2011, this cheque was for the sum of $12,000.[^252] Behind this cheque, Quah had written to instruct the bank to deposit a total of $7,500 into the following accounts:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="11.64%"> <col width="88.36%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sum</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Destination</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$6,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Quah’s Cashline Account</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$1,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Quah’s mother’s account</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$500</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Unidentified account, which did not belong to Quah, TSM, or the Company</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

157    This cheque was encashed on 31 October 2011 itself. Quah agreed that $6,000 was indeed deposited into her Cashline Account on 31 October 2011 (a fact confirmed in the corresponding bank statement).[^253] She also agreed that her defence was that she had withdrawn the _full_ sum of $6,000 from her Cashline Account and handed it to TSM “very shortly after” it was deposited:[^254]

> Q:    So, if I understand your defence correctly, after this $6,000 was deposited you must have withdrawn the entire sum surely after and hand\[ed\] it \[to TSM\], correct?

> A:    I handed over 6,000 to him in cash.

> …

> Q:    …Your own account, let’s go step-by-step. Step 1, you collect cash cheques from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Step 2, you deposit these cash cheques into your personal bank account\[s\].

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    The same bank accounts that are reflected in \[your Compilation\].

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Step 3, you withdraw **all** the money relating to these cash cheques from these bank accounts.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Step 4, you hand over **all** of this money to \[TSM\].

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So, we are clear on that? We agreed on that?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    So, now I want you to focus your mind on P7. So, this is a cheque from Win Tran agree?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, it is one of those that you would have deposited into one of \[your\] personal bank accounts?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And specifically, actually we’re right now looking at the partial deposit into your \[Cashline Account\] for $6,000. And I want you to remember that we have just been through step 1, step 2, step 3, step 4 of how you would encash a cheque and withdraw the amount and hand it to \[TSM\].

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So, if you have deposited $6,000 from a Win Tran cheque into your \[Cashline Account\], you should very shortly after withdraw $6,000. So that you can hand it to \[TSM\], agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And this is according to your own defence.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

158    Quah’s attention was then drawn to her Compilation. The Compilation showed that she had made three withdrawals totalling _only_ $2,500 (as opposed to $6,000) from her Cashline Account in November 2011. This sum was $3,500 less than the $6,000 she had deposited into her account on 31 October 2011. When confronted with this discrepancy, Quah admitted that she kept some of the monies from the cash cheques she deposited into her personal accounts (and therefore did not withdraw the full sums corresponding to these cheques). In addition, she agreed she _knew_ that it was wrong for her to keep the monies from the cash cheques she deposited in her accounts.[^255]

159    That said, she claimed that she had an arrangement with TSM where she would give him her _own_ cash first whenever he wanted money. She would then deduct the sum she had already given to TSM from the monies she later encashed from the cash cheques she deposited into her own accounts. According to Quah, she had “no choice” but to give TSM her own money first as he was “chasing after \[her\] for money all the time” and she did not have the time to go to the bank every day to withdraw cash for him:[^256]

> Q:    This \[sum of $2,500 shown in the Compilation\] is much less…it’s in fact…slightly more than one-third \[of\] the $6,000 you received in \[your Cashline Account\] on 31st October 2011.

> A:    Yes, but I want to add…I gave him $2,500 because every day he will be chasing after me for money. I gave him my own money because you ask me why I only withdraw $2,500, right?

> Q:    Actually, all I ask\[ed\] you to do was to agree or disagree that 2,500 is much less than the 6,000 you received in your account on 31st October 2011.

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**     But, since you mentioned, Madam Quah, you said I gave him my own money, **are you now suggesting that in fact you did not withdraw the full sums from the cash cheques that you deposited into your personal bank accounts?**

> **A:**      **I did not.**

> Q:    So, you are admitting that you kept some of the money from the cash cheques that you deposited into your personal bank accounts?

> A:    I also have some cash in my own personal bank account, and…our transaction is in such a way that whenever he wanted money, I would give him my personal money, cash money to him first. And then I would deduct from the cash cheque that I deposited for his share.

> **Q:**      **Now, actually, my question was, so you kept some of the monies from the cash cheques \[you\] deposited into your bank accounts and I want you to give me a “yes or no” answer.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    And when I ask\[ed\] you earlier in cross-examination \[if\] you agree that you cannot keep amounts from cash cheques because they belong to the company, you agree\[d\]?

> A:    Yes, I agree.

> **Q:**      **So, actually you knew that it was wrong to keep money from the cash cheque\[s\] in your personal bank accounts but you did it anyway?**

> **A:**      **I agree** but at that time I ha\[d\] no choice because he was chasing after me for money all the time. Where would I have the time to go to the bank everyday to withdraw money for him?

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

160    In this case, Quah claimed she only withdrew $2,500 from her account to give to TSM as she had already given $3,500 of her own cash to him.[^257] No documentary evidence was adduced to show that she did actually give either of these sums to TSM.

161    The Prosecution then pointed out that Quah’s version was _different_ from her initial stance on the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex (_viz_., that she withdrew **all** of the monies corresponding to these cheques from her three personal accounts and gave **all** of the monies withdrawn to TSM). Quah agreed, and proceeded to furnish an even more detailed version involving TSM _and_ Ho – which she never raised during their cross-examinations and in her own examination-in-chief:[^258]

> **Q:**      **Now, Madam Quah, you are now saying that you kept some money from the cash cheques that you deposited into your personal bank accounts, you agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And you agree that this is different from what we just went through 10 minutes ago when we went through step 1, step 2, step 3, step 4 of your defence.**

> **A:**      **Yes, I agree that it’s different**, but every day…I would have to give \[TSM\] money. Every time he sees a cheque, he will want money. I know that I’m in the wrong for depositing into my bank account and only giving him a portion. But because I have already given him cash upfront previously, I would definitely have to deduct it, right? I know that it is wrong to do that, because just now, \[Prosecution\], you said 1, 2, 3, 4. I agree with you. I agree with what you said. I do not know how to put it. Every time I receive a cash cheque, I would have to sit down with \[TSM\] to talk about how he was going to get the money. Because…Eric Ho’s cheques will be blank. He did not fill in anything at all. So I cannot just retrieve cash for \[TSM\]. I would need to speak to Eric Ho and when Eric Ho gave me the instructions, then I can bank in the cheque.

> Q:    Okay, Madam Quah, I have given you quite a lot of latitude to explain yourself and when I said step 1, 2, 3, 4, I think it’s also important not to misrepresent what I asked you and you remember that when I asked you step 1, 2, 3, 4, I asked you to confirm that this is your defence.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And out of complete fairness to you, Madam Quah, do you want me to go through step 1, 2, 3, 4 again?

> A:    There’s no need to.

> Q:    Alright. So what we can agree on, looking at \[your Compilation\], looking at…those withdrawals for November 2011, the sum of $2,500 doesn’t match the sum of $6,000.

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **You didn’t withdraw that whole sum \[of\] $6,000 from \[your Cashline Account\] and hand it to \[TSM\].**

> …

> **A:**      **Yes, but I have already given the cash portion to him.**

> **Q:**      **And so you have given us now a new explanation that you separately gave cash to \[TSM\].**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And now under cross-examination, it is the first time that you are raising this allegation, do you agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

162    As for the shortfall of $6,000 (since the cash cheque that Quah collected from Win Tran was for the total sum of $12,000), Quah claimed that TSM had:[^259]

> (a)     told her that he wanted only $6,000 in cash; and

> (b)     wanted her to deposit the remaining $6,000 into her own account because “he did not want to get so much money on that day”.

163    I noted that the remaining sum from this cash cheque appeared to be $4,500 instead of $6,000. This was because Quah had also instructed the bank to deposit a total of $1,500 into her mother’s account and another unidentified account that did not belong to her, TSM, or the Company.[^260] However, neither party pursued this during the trial. That said, on Quah’s evidence alone, it showed that she failed to deposit the remaining $6,000 into her own accounts (as she claimed TSM had instructed her to). Instead, she deposited $1,000 into her mother’s account and $500 into an unidentified account.

164    In any event, Quah’s account as to the remaining $6,000[^261] was _another_ claim she failed to raise during TSM’s cross-examination and in her examination-in-chief. It also appeared inconsistent with her fresh claim that she had “no choice” but to give TSM her own cash first as he was supposedly “chasing after \[her\] for money all the time”.[^262] If TSM was indeed doing so, why would he allow Quah to deposit a substantial sum of $6,000 into her own account, with no instructions for this large sum to be given to him at some later date? Quah never explained this inconsistency.

165    I did not give _any_ weight to all of Quah’s fresh claims. That said, I bore in mind her _admission_ that she did keep part of the monies from the cash cheques she encashed by depositing into her personal accounts.

166    The shifting nature of Quah’s evidence was most evident on the second day of her cross-examination. On that day, she gave two further accounts about the circumstances surrounding this _same_ cash cheque. She _first_ claimed that she deposited $6,000 from this cheque into her account because TSM owed her $6,000.[^263] Given Quah’s claim that TSM owed _her_ $6,000, the Prosecution pointed out that it was illogical for Quah to have then withdrawn $2,500 from her account to give to TSM (since she did not owe TSM any money). Quah disagreed, and _then_ claimed that TSM had also wanted her to give him an _additional_ sum of $3,000 to $5,000 on the first week of every month[^264] to pay the monthly instalments in respect of his car loan. Quah never raised either of these claims during TSM’s cross-examination and in her examination-in-chief. I therefore did not give them _any_ weight.

167    Quah’s various versions were all clearly afterthoughts – to explain the discrepancies between the sums stated on the cash cheques (which she admitted to encashing by depositing into her three personal accounts) and the very different sums she actually withdrew from her accounts soon after (as listed in her Compilation). Indeed, she admitted as much during her cross-examination:[^265]

> Q:    Now, Mdm Quah, we spent…a lot of time on this point, so I’m really just going to summarise. Now, number 1, yesterday, you said that you kept $3,500 being the difference…between \[$\]6,000 and $2,500 and you knew it was wrong. This was version 1, this was what you said yesterday, agree?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Today, you g\[a\]ve version 2. You said \[TSM\] owed you $6,000. So, it’s okay to keep $6,000, you agree?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And then after that, I pointed out to you that it’s illogical to give money back to \[TSM\] because you said he owed it to you…Because I put it to you that it is illogical because \[TSM\] was returning money to you, why would you need to withdraw $2,500?

> A:    I disagree.

> Q:    And that’s when you gave version 3, a completely new explanation about payment for \[TSM’s\] car.

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **And, really, the reason why we have had three versions in relation to the same cheque is because you know the numbers don’t add up, Mdm Quah.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

##### More fresh claims to account for another cash cheque

168    In cross-examination, Quah was shown the image of another cash cheque she had collected from Win Tran (**P8**). Dated 29 June 2012, this cheque was for the sum of $12,000.[^266] Behind this cheque, Quah had written to instruct the bank to deposit the full sum of $12,000 into her Cashline Account. This cheque was encashed on 2 July 2012.

169    Quah’s attention was then drawn to her Compilation, which showed that she had made five withdrawals totalling _only_ $3,000 (as opposed to $12,000) from her Cashline Account in July 2012. Quah then testified that she had instead encashed the full sum of $12,000 _over the counter_ on 2 July 2012. She said she then passed this full sum to TSM later that same day.[^267] According to Quah, she never deposited this cheque into her Cashline Account. As such, it was not reflected in her Compilation.

170    Quah’s account in relation to this cheque was, however, _again_ different from her initial stance on the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex (_viz_, she deposited **all** of the cash cheques she collected into her three personal bank accounts, as reflected in her Compilation). It was never raised during TSM’s cross-examination and in her examination-in-chief. Indeed, it was only during her cross-examination that Quah testified that she did not bank all of the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex into her three personal accounts. I therefore did not give _any_ weight to this fresh claim. In any event, Quah conceded that she had no evidence showing that she _did_ actually hand any cash from this cheque to TSM.[^268]

##### Further fresh claims in relation to sums shown in Compilation

171    It was Quah’s position that her Compilation showed that she withdrew a total of $451,400 from her three personal bank accounts between 2 January 2010 and 16 August 2014. According to Quah, this sum came from the cash cheques issued by EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex (that she deposited into her accounts).[^269] Cross-examination revealed _more_ flaws in her evidence.

Quah had no receipts showing she handed $451,400 to TSM

172    In cross-examination, Quah _agreed_ that her Compilation did not show that she did actually hand $451,400 in cash to TSM (or indeed _any_ sum of cash to TSM).[^270] She _initially_ testified that she did not have any documentary evidence showing that she handed this sum of $451,400 to TSM.[^271] But, she changed her evidence immediately after when the Prosecution questioned why she did not notwithstanding her long experience “working with accounts”. She then claimed (for the _first_ time) that she had receipts showing that she handed $451,400 in cash to TSM in her computer in the Office. She also claimed that TSM had signed these receipts to acknowledge receipt of the cash she had allegedly handed him. She testified that she had “no time to copy \[these receipts\] out” as she “needed to buy a thumb drive to copy the information out”. She said she was not able to do this in time as TSM had asked her to leave the Office immediately after she entered it on 25 August 2014 and she could not enter the Office again thereafter.[^272]

173    Quah agreed that this was the first time she was raising the existence of these receipts. When pressed by the Prosecution, her inconsistent and evasive responses showed that this claim about the existence of receipts – which would have been _highly_ material to her case – was clearly an afterthought. Her exchange with the Prosecution bear setting out in full to appreciate the unsatisfactory nature of her belated evidence:

> Q:    And you agree, Mdm Quah, that actually, this entire thing about receipts showing that \[TSM\] received the cash from you today…is the first time you are raising it?

> **A:**      **Because you asked me about it, so I answered.**

> **Q:**      **\[TSM\] was not asked about this, when \[he\] came to Court. You agree?**

> **A:**      **Nobody asked me.**

> ...

> **Q:**      **Now, Mdm Quah, I just want to be very clear that I understood your answer correctly. Because, actually, \[my\] question to you was very simple. It was that from April 2015 \[when investigations commenced\] to 16th January 2019, today was the first day you mentioned the issue of receipts. Yes or no?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    So, actually, you concede that you did not raise it to the IO?

> A:    I did challenge him.

> Q:    Mdm Quah, the question is very simple. Did you or did you not raise \[the issue of receipts\] to the IO?

> A:    I did.

> **Q:**      **So, now it’s different. I give you one more chance to clarify. First question was, between April 2015 and 16th January 2019, today is the first day you mentioned the receipts. Do you agree or disagree?**

> **A:**      **Yes, I agree.**

> Q:    Logically, that means you could not have mentioned it to the IO?

> A:    This is the first time I’m raising this in Court that I had the evidence…But I did mention this to the IO before. I told him to go to the office to get the system out. In my computer systems, there were a lot of information. Did he get them? No, he also did not have any records.

> **Q:**      **I want you to focus your mind on the receipts, Mdm Quah that’s the only thing we are talking about now. We are keeping it very simple. So, you answer my questions clearly, okay? Did you or did you not mention the issue of receipts for $451,400 to the IO? Yes or no?**

> **A:**      **No, because at that time, there were no bank statements to refer to.**

> **Q:**      **Yah, but the receipts have nothing to do with the bank statements. You agree? Because if you…had the receipts, the receipts would show that you gave cash to \[TSM\]. Agree? Agree or disagree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    And you also accepted that apart from the 2 issues you pointed out, all your statements \[recorded by\] the police \[were\] accurately recorded.

> A:    Yes, at that time I did say that.

> Q:    With the exception, in all fairness to you, of \[the\] 2 \[unrelated\] points that we went through yesterday.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, the truth of the matter is that you did not mention the receipts of $451,400 to the police?

> A:    I did say. But it was not written down.

> **Q:**      **You’re being inconsistent, Mdm Quah.**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **In any event it’s very clear that these receipts issue, today is the first day that you have mentioned it in Court.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    Even though you agree it’s quite important.

> A:    I did tell the IO…and asked him to go to my office…\[t\]o take the computer system to go to Cantonment CID to ask the CAD officer to open up and see what is…in my computer \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

> Q:    Mdm Quah, I’m going to have to remind you to speak in Mandarin.

> A:    But it was not written. Now, you are telling me that I did not say. At that time, I have already told him about it but he ignored me.

> **Q:**      **Okay. Mdm Quah, so we’ve been through quite a few iterations on this whether you told the IO, you didn’t tell the IO, whether you said in Court, didn’t say in Court…**

> **A:**      **Then let’s not waste time.**

> Q:    So, really, I’m just going to put it to you that my case is that, you \[are\] not being truthful. There are no receipts.

> A:    I disagree. There were receipts on the computer.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

174    I did not give _any_ weight to Quah’s fresh claim as to the existence of these receipts. Their existence would have been _very_ significant to her case. Yet, she never raised this critical fact during the cross-examinations of the IO and TSM. She also did not raise it during her examination-in-chief. I agreed with the Prosecution that this claim was “clearly a concocted…afterthought as \[Quah\] realised the weight of the evidence against her”.[^273] These receipts _never_ existed.

To account for excess not reflected in Compilation

175    In cross-examination, Quah _agreed_ that she had collected _more than_ $451,400 from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex.[^274] In fact, she _agreed_ that she had collected a total of $575,788.89 in cash cheques from these customers. This larger sum was stated in a table the Prosecution had prepared (**P26**). It was based on a breakdown of the sums stated in the charges, which appeared in the IO’s conditioned statement. The table prepared by the Prosecution (“the Summation”) listed all the cash cheques issued by EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex.[^275] The figure of $575,788.89 in the Summation was $124,388.89 more than the sum of $451,400 that Quah had reflected in her Compilation.

176    In cross-examination, Quah _agreed_ that her Compilation did not explain this excess of $124,388.89. However, she claimed – again, for the _first_ time – that this was because she had encashed cash cheques corresponding to this excess over the counter at the bank. According to Quah, she had then immediately handed the cash to TSM.[^276]

177    Yet, Quah also agreed that she had deposited _all_ of the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex into her three personal accounts.[^277] This effectively contradicted her evidence that she had encashed cash cheques amounting to $124,388.89 over the counter at the bank. In addition, I noted that she did not refer to the existence of any “receipts” where TSM acknowledged receipt of $124,388.89 in cash from her.[^278]

178    There appeared to be a further inconsistency in Quah’s evidence. She had earlier claimed that she did not have the time to go to the bank every day to withdraw cash for TSM.[^279] Yet, she now claimed that she was able to encash $124,388.89 worth of cash cheques over the counter _at the bank_. Quah never explained this inconsistency. She also did not explain why the majority of the cash cheques were deposited into her accounts, and why some had to be encashed over the counter instead. In fact, Quah _agreed_ that this latter version differed from her initial stance on the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex (_viz_., she deposited **all** the cash cheques she collected into her three personal bank accounts). She initially appeared to disagree that it was a convenient afterthought to explain away the discrepancy between her Compilation and the Summation.[^280] But, she later accepted that she had changed her evidence because she could not reconcile her initial stance with the Summation. I set out Quah’s evidence:[^281]

> Q:    \[After confirming with Quah her initial version in relation to the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex.\] So you agree that was version 1, step 1, step 2, step 3, step 4?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    But you have now given version 2, you agree?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Because now you are telling me that, “No, no, no, not all of the cash cheques went into my personal bank accounts.”

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    You are now telling me that you encashed some of them over the counter?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And then you immediately handed it over?

> A:    To \[TSM\].

> **Q:**      **And this is a new version, you agree it’s different from version 1?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And really, Mdm Quah, I’m going to suggest \[to\] you that the reason you have changed your evidence is because when I gave you \[the Summation\], you realised that the number doesn’t match \[your Compilation\].**

> **A:**      **I agree.**

> Q:    So, you agree you changed your evidence when I confronted you with the accurate documentary evidence?

> A:    I agree, because the figures – because there was a difference of…124,000. I would definitely want to defend myself.

> Q:    So, really, the fact that this explanation is only coming now, Mdm Quah, shows that it is a convenient afterthought?

> A:    No…it was only this morning that you gave me \[the Summation\] when I look at my documents, whatever you gave to my lawyer and my lawyer showed to me.

> …

> Q:    Mdm Quah, I…asked you to agree whether it was a convenient afterthought, the fact that you have now given version 2 of your evidence. And you disagreed with me. You then started to go into an explanation relating to your conversations with your lawyer. So, it’s up to you whether you want to continue with that answer.

> A:    I feel that I should not continue.

> **Q:**      **Certainly. Now, Mdm Quah, I’m just going to point out to you that the \[Summation\] of cash cheques is really a subset of the amounts in the charges against you?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And all the relevant documents that were meant to be disclosed to you were, in fact, disclosed to you.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> …

> Q:    Now, Mdm Quah, I just want to make it very clear to you that you were the one who raised version 1 of your defence with steps 1 to 4, you agree?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    It’s your own explanation of what happened to the cash cheques from Time-Flex, EDS and Win Tran?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So, when I gave you \[the Summation\], I was merely pointing out to you what you should already know?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And so, really, you’ve changed your evidence now, because there is no way to reconcile version 1 with the \[Summation\] that I have given to you?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

179    I did not give _any_ weight to Quah’s fresh claim that she encashed $124,388.89 worth of cash cheques over the counter at the bank. It was inconsistent with her initial stance on these cash cheques (a stance she confirmed _several_ times during her cross-examination). Her fresh claim was clearly an afterthought to explain away the discrepancy between her Compilation and the Summation.

Alleged “Cash Withdrawal Practice” an afterthought

180    In closing submissions, Counsel made multiple references to an alleged “Cash Withdrawal Practice”. Counsel had described this practice, together with the alleged “Cash Collection Practice” and “Encashing Practice”[^282] in the following terms:

> **IV**.     **THE DEFENCE’S CASE, AND THE ISSUES ARISING**

> …

> 45.    At all material times, \[Quah\] was acting under TSM’s instructions.

> 46.    In particular, \[Quah\] was instructed by TSM to collect cash, or cash cheques as payments from the \[Clients\], and hand the cash to him in the following manner:

>> (1)    In respect of the cash collected, \[Quah\] would hand the cash collected to TSM directly (“**Cash Collection Practice**”).

>> (2)    In respect of the cash cheques collected (save for the \[cash cheques from EDS that Quah deposited into the Joint Account[^283]\]:

>>> (a)    Initially, \[Quah\] would encash the cash cheques over bank counters for cash, and hand the cash collected to TSM (“**Encashing Practice**”)

>>> (b)    Subsequently, \[Quah\] would deposit the cash cheques into various \[personal\] bank accounts \[of hers\]. All the cash from the cash cheques that were deposited directly into bank accounts other than the \[Company’s Account\] and the \[Joint Account\] was accounted for: \[Quah\] gave her “_personal money_” to TSM, and where \[Quah\] deposited the cash cheques into \[her Cashline Account, Savings Account, and CashPlus Account\], she would withdraw cash in sums of S$500, S$800, and S$1,000, and hand the cash withdrawn to TSM (collectively, “**Cash Withdrawal Practice**”).

> \[emphasis in original\]

181    These submissions completely ignored the fact that Quah only raised the “Cash Withdrawal Practice” when she was cross-examined. She never raised it during TSM’s cross-examination and in her evidence-in-chief.[^284] Indeed, it was clear from the manner in which her evidence on this practice arose that it was “nothing more than a convenient afterthought”.[^285] I set out her testimony in full in **Annex A** to these grounds, and summarise it in the paragraphs that follow.

182    In cross-examination, Quah agreed with the Prosecution that her Compilation did _not_ include _all_ the cash withdrawals she made from her three personal bank accounts. To illustrate this point, the Prosecution referred Quah to a bank statement for her Cashline Account. This showed a “CASH WITHDRAWAL AT ATM” of $1,000 on 5 September 2010.[^286] The Prosecution noted that Quah had not included this withdrawal in her Compilation (which only listed withdrawals on 2, 7, 15, 28, and 29 September 2010). In response, Quah testified that she had made a “mistake”. She claimed that the date corresponding to a $1,000 withdrawal on 2 September 2010 (as she had reflected in her Compilation) should have been 5 September 2010 instead.[^287]

183    The Prosecution then pointed out that this was actually _not_ a “mistake”. This was because Quah’s bank statement[^288] did _in fact_ show a “CASH WITHDRAWAL AT ATM” of $1,000 on 2 September 2010. On seeing this, Quah back-pedalled and _agreed_ that she had not made a mistake. I had observed Quah when she testified. It was clear that she had been caught out. She then tried to explain her omission of this withdrawal from her Compilation by claiming that it had been “very difficult” to analyse her bank statements. I found this difficult to believe. After all, these were _her_ bank statements showing _her_ withdrawals from _her_ accounts. The Prosecution had also disclosed all of _her_ bank statements at the pre-trial stage – sometime in early-June 2018. Given that she only tendered this Compilation in mid-January 2019, she had more than six months (at the very least) to review _her_ statements. The words “CASH WITHDRAWAL AT ATM” were also clearly stated on her statements.

184    Quah then agreed with the Prosecution that she had “suddenly remembered” (during her cross-examination) that this $1,000 withdrawal on 5 September 2010 should have been included in her Compilation (as such, she said that her Compilation should have indicated a total withdrawal of $451,400 _and_ $1,000, or $452,400). She went on to claim that this $1,000 withdrawal on 5 September 2010 was specifically from the cash cheques she had collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex (which she had deposited into her Cashline Account). She further claimed that she had “definitely” handed this sum to TSM.[^289] I did not find these claims believable as well. It was difficult to understand how Quah could so definitively testify as to the source and destination of these monies when more than eight years had passed. This was especially in light of her supposed difficulty in analysing her bank statements.[^290]

185    To bolster the point that Quah’s Compilation did not include _all_ the cash withdrawals she made from her three personal accounts, the Prosecution referred her to another bank statement for the Cashline Account.[^291] This showed two instances of “CASH WITHRAWAL AT ATM” for $200 (on 29 October 2010) and $400 (on 30 October 2010). Quah agreed that her Compilation did _not_ reflect these two withdrawals as well. She also agreed that it was _entirely possible_ that she had made these two withdrawals to pay for her personal expenses. Indeed, she accepted that she _did_ withdraw cash for her personal expenses from her three personal accounts. That said, she denied that it was possible that her $1,000 withdrawal on 5 September 2010 might have also been for her personal expenses. Immediately after, however, she:[^292]

> (a)      _agreed_ that she had no way of telling whether this withdrawal was indeed related to the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex (hence contradicting her earlier evidence[^293]).

> (b)     effectively testified that she had “_no_ system” of telling whether her withdrawals from her three personal accounts were:

>> (i)       related to the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex (which she had deposited into her accounts);

>> (ii)       for her personal expenses; or

>> (iii)       supposedly passed to TSM.

186    It was _only_ when the Prosecution put it to Quah that she had “no system of telling which cash withdrawals \[were\] for handing money to \[TSM\] and \[which\] were for \[her\] personal expenses” that Quah raised the “Cash Withdrawal Practice”.[^294] In this regard, she claimed that she would _always_ give the $500 and $1,000 withdrawals from her three personal accounts to TSM.[^295] According to Quah, she had used $500 and $1,000 as a “convenient mark” to indicate that she had handed these sums to TSM.[^296] She also claimed that she could identify the withdrawals meant for her personal expenses because she _always_ withdrew less than $500 for such expenses.

187    I gave _no_ weight to Quah’s evidence on this alleged “Cash Withdrawal Practice”. It was clearly an afterthought, to explain how she could differentiate the withdrawals she made from her three personal accounts. It was an attempt to concoct a “system”, when none existed.[^297] If this had indeed been Quah’s consistent practice between July 2009 and June 2014 (_ie_, a period of _five_ years), it was not at all clear why she failed to raise it:

> (a)     during TSM’s cross-examination;

> (b)     in her evidence-in-chief; and

> (c)     when the Prosecution initially referred her to the three withdrawals from her Cashline Account.[^298]

188    In fact, when the Prosecution asked Quah to explain why she failed to raise the “Cash Withdrawal Practice” earlier, she could only reply, “I do not know”.[^299]

189    The Prosecution also highlighted another inconsistency in Quah’s evidence on the “Cash Withdrawal Practice” – it was at odds with her earlier evidence that TSM had instructed her to withdraw the _full_ sum corresponding to the cash cheques she deposited into her personal accounts. The Prosecution also observed that Counsel’s closing submissions had sought to advance an explanation for some of the cash cheques from EDS that Quah never testified on. I set out the Prosecution’s submissions on these aspects, which I agreed with:[^300]

> 31    Crucially, there is an important difference between (a) encashing cash cheques and passing \[the full amount of the corresponding\] cash to TSM; and (b) depositing the cash cheques into personal bank accounts, and deciding at one’s absolute discretion to give TSM sums \[of cash in denominations\] of $500, $800 and $1,000 \[that do not amount to the full sum of cash enchased from the cash cheques\].

> 32    In fact, \[Quah’s\] own evidence was that \[TSM told her\] to cash out \[all of\] the money and go back to the office immediately to hand the money to TSM:[^301]

>> Q:    Okay. Madam Quah, let \[me\] just pause you there. Earlier in your evidence, you said that you had shared with \[TSM\] that it was very tough and wasting your time for you to queue at the bank, to cash out the cash cheques. And then you gave evidence that \[TSM\] told you that you could deposit the cash cheque into your account instead. So did \[TSM\] then also tell you what you are supposed to do with the cash that \[had\] been deposited into your account?

>> **A:**      **To cash out the money and \[go\] back to the office immediately to hand it to him.**

>> Q:    And were you able to do so?

>> **A:**      **Yes. Because \[LEC\] would drive me to the bank.**

>> Q:    So you are saying for cash cheques that were deposited into your accounts, you could immediately withdraw the cash out?

>> A:    If \[TSM\] wanted the money I would give him my personal money first. Because for cash cheque, even \[if\] you deposited it \[today\] you would have to wait until 2:00pm on the next day to withdraw.

> 33    \[Quah’s\] own explanation is therefore inherently untenable. On one hand, she claims that she had TSM’s consent and instructions to deposit the cash cheques into her account\[s\] and withdraw the \[full\] sum \[corresponding to the cash cheques\]. On the other hand, she appears (based on her own account \[in cross-examination\] to have unilaterally decided that it was up to her to decide how to deal with the monies, and that she could simply withdraw them from her own account in the denominations that she pleased. Conveniently, she only raised much of this under cross-examination; tellingly, despite being the accounts manager, she has raised no objective evidence in her favour.

> 34    Moreover, the Defence raises at \[61\] of its closing submissions _yet another different explanation_ for some of the EDS cash cheques, as compared with \[Quah’s\] evidence under cross-examination. They cite extracts from \[Quah’s 7th investigation statement: AB26\] in which she state\[d\]:

>> (a)    She had encashed DBS/E003 cheque for S$16,329.48 and handed over the entire sum in cash denominations of $50 and $10 notes.

>> (b)    She had either banked in DBS302512 cheque for S$12,000 and cashed it out, or encashed it, and handed over the entire sum in denominations of S$50 to \[TSM\].

> 35    \[Quah\] has therefore shown herself to give different explanations based on what suits her defence – it has changed from encashing certain specific \[cash\] cheques and handing over the sum in full; to withdrawing sums of S$500, S$800 and S$1000 after depositing the cheques into her personal bank accounts. It is clear that she herself cannot account for each sum.

> \[emphasis in original\]

190    In fact, Quah went on to claim (again, for the _first_ time) that it was TSM who had directed her to only withdraw cash in denominations of $500 or $1,000 from her personal accounts. She later said that this practice was also pursuant to an agreement she had with TSM, so that it would be “easier for \[TSM\] to check and also for \[her\] to check” as TSM checked her bank statements “every month, every year”.[^302] I gave no weight to these claims as well. Quah’s evidence effectively meant that TSM permitted her to:

> (a)     choose the sums she withdrew from her personal accounts, no matter the amounts stated on the cash cheques from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex; and

> (b)     mix the remaining amounts from these cash cheques (which belonged to the Company), no matter how much, with her personal funds in her accounts and apply them to her personal expenses.

191    But, she failed to raise any of these aspects during TSM’s cross-examination. Indeed, when asked to explain her failure to do so, she could only say that nobody had asked her.[^303] This was hardly an explanation.

##### Quah deposited numerous cash cheques into credit lines

192    The special nature of Quah’s Cashline and CashPlus accounts – two of the three personal bank accounts into which Quah had deposited the cash cheques she collected – was raised during her cross-examination. These accounts were neither current accounts nor savings accounts. They were instead lines of credit that allowed Quah to access cash whenever she needed it. She thus had to pay interest to the respective banks whenever she withdrew cash from these accounts. In other words, whenever Quah withdrew (or, more accurately, borrowed) money from these accounts to give to TSM (as she claimed she did), she had to pay interest to the banks.[^304] The evidence showed that Quah deposited _numerous_ cash cheques into these two accounts, even though she also had a savings account (into which she had only deposited some of the cash cheques she collected).

Quah’s Cashline Account (a credit line)

193    It made no sense for Quah to borrow money from the bank to give to TSM, and incur interest at the same time. After all, the money that she was borrowing from the bank (to supposedly pass to TSM) was not even going to be hers to keep. She could have simply just encashed these cash cheques and not incur _any_ interest. The absurdity of Quah’s evidence was evident when she was questioned by the Prosecution:[^305]

> Q:    So, in effect, when you withdraw money from this account, you have to pay interest on it?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    In other words, you are, in fact, borrowing money from the bank.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And you claimed that you were depositing cash cheques into this bank account for the purpose of withdrawing the cash to hand to \[TSM\]. Mdm Quah can you just agree or disagree?

> A:    Yes.

> …

> **Q:**      **In other words, you were borrowing money from the bank with interest to pay \[TSM\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And you agree that this is quite illogical?**

> **A:**      **I agree.**

> **Q:**      **Because if, really, all you needed to do was \[to\] encash the cash cheque, you shouldn’t be having to pay interest?**

> **A:**      **It is very troublesome to have to queue at the counter…**

> Q:    Okay. Mdm Quah, this is, in fact, a false dichotomy. So, you have claimed that you deposited cash cheques into a Cashline account instead of going to the bank to encash it over the counter.

> A:    Yes, it’s troublesome.

> **Q:**      **So, you would rather pay interest on company money than go to the bank?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **Even though going to the bank is part of your responsibilities as an employee?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And, of course, this doesn’t even answer the question of why you didn’t deposit the cash cheques into a normal savings account?**

> A:    All along, I have only been using Cashine \[from\] DBS.

> **Q:**      **So, really, what this suggest\[s\] is that you were using the company’s cheques to pay off your own debts.**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **Because if they really were for payments to \[TSM\], you wouldn’t withdraw from an account that you have to pay interest on?**

> **A:**      **I’m already very used to doing it.**

> **Q:**      **So, are you suggesting that out of your own generosity, you \[were\] content to pay interest \[in respect of\] cash cheques belonging to the company?**

> **A:**      **It’s just tens of dollars, it means nothing to me.**

> **Q:**      **But, actually, you agreed with me earlier that you also used this bank account for personal expenses. Yes?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

194    Quah’s attention was also drawn to her August-September 2010 bank statement for her Cashline Account. This showed that two GIRO deductions were made from this account in September 2010 (amounting to about $102):[^306]

> (a)     by “PRUDENTIAL ASSURANCE” on 1 September 2010; and

> (b)     by “AMERICAN INTL ASS CO” on 3 September 2010.

195    These deductions both occurred _after_ Quah had deposited a cash cheque of $6,000 from Win Tran[^307] (dated 31 August 2010, and encashed on 1 September 2010) into her Cashline Account. In cross-examination, Quah _agreed_ that both of these GIRO deductions had been for her personal expenses. She also initially _agreed_ that she was “applying cash cheques deposited into \[her Cashline Account\] to other personal expenses”. However, she denied doing so when the Prosecution repeated its question:[^308]

> Q:    And so, this cheque of $6,000, I just want you to confirm that it corresponds with the payment by cheque of $6,000 into your \[Cashline Account\] on 1st September 2010.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And if you turn the page on AB2 to page 206. And I want you to focus on the transaction activity that occurs on 1st September 2010. The 1st line item says, “GIRO \[deduction\] by Prudential Assurance”. Do you see that, Mdm Quah?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **You agree this was a personal expense?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    And similarly, if you just move your finger down the page on 3rd September 2010, there was also a GIRO \[deduction\] by American International Assurance Company. Do you see that?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **\[And this was\] also a personal expense, agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And these personal expenses occurred after that cheque \[of $6,000\] was deposited into this account?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, really, you \[were\] applying cash cheques \[that you\] deposited into \[your Cashline Account\] to other personal expenses?**

> **A:**      **Yes**. But there is interest charged to Cashline. I would rather pay interest is because I have personal items inside.

> …

> **Q:**      **So, really, you are agreeing that you used cash cheques to make payments for your personal expenses?**

> **A:**      **No, I cannot use them.**

> **Q:**      **Well, you agreed with me, Mdm Quah, that those GIRO deductions took place after the cash cheque \[of $6,000\] was deposited. So really, there’s no other way to construe it?**

> **A:**      **No, it’s not like this.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

196    In re-examination, Quah was asked to clarify the source of her monies to meet these two GIRO deductions (which had taken place on a monthly basis, together with other deductions). She failed to provide a direct answer:[^309]

> Q:    Mdm Quah, can I ask you to pick up tab 2 of the Agreed Bundle? And I would ask you to turn to page 205 and then turn over the page to 206. Now, on this page the Learned DPP had asked you about GIRO payment transactions recorded for 1st September 2010 and 3rd September 2010. Do you recall?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Okay, can you clarify what was your source of monies to make these GIRO payments?

> Q:    This is DBS Cashline. I’ve been using this for many years. I have deposited my own personal money into this account. I could use the \[overdraft line\]…for other expenses of mine. But ---

> A:    Okay, Mdm Quah ---

> Q:    that’s it.

> Q:    is that your clarification?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Okay.

> A:    Because it’s my own personal money inside.

197    I did not find Quah’s “clarification” persuasive. It was vague, and she failed to refer to her August-September 2010 bank statement (or any other statement for this account) to show the “personal money” she had apparently deposited into her Cashline Account to meet these GIRO deductions. A review of her bank statements for the Cashline Account showed that she was being charged interest nearly _every_ month from September 2010 to June 2014. While the total interest charged between this period was relatively small (amounting to $1,447.39), it was difficult to understand why Quah willingly paid such interest (as she said she did[^310]) nearly every month on sums she was borrowing from the bank to give to TSM – when:

> (a)     she was not going to retain any money for herself;

> (b)     her case was that she was never comfortable with TSM’s alleged instructions;[^311] and

> (c)     she could have deposited all the cash cheques into her Savings Account (which already existed) and not pay _any_ interest.

198    It was also not clear why it was “very troublesome” for Quah to queue and encash these cash cheques over the counter at the bank (and not pay any interest to the bank). After all, this was one of her duties as an employee.

Quah’s CashPlus Account (another credit line)

199    The bank statements for the CashPlus Account showed that Quah was depositing cash cheques into an account that was _perpetually_ in overdraft (a fact that she agreed to as well). But, she denied that it was illogical for her to pay interest in relation to _cash_ cheques that belonged to the Company. She then went to claim – again, for the _first_ time – that TSM had seen that her CashPlus and Cashline accounts had overdraft facilities, and so wanted her to deposit the cash cheques into these accounts as it would be easier for him to get the money. She also claimed (once more, for the _first_ time) that TSM would help her pay the interest that her two credit lines incurred as she was letting him use her accounts[^312] (a version that contradicted her earlier evidence that _she_ paid the interest incurred on the Cashline Account[^313]). I set out Quah’s evidence in detail, to show the many fresh claims she made during her cross-examination – none of which were raised during TSM’s cross-examination and in her examination-in-chief:[^314]

> Q:    …I want you to turn to AB4. Now, AB4 is your bank account statement for \[your CashPlus Account\]. And I just want you to look at the 1st page, so we’re at AB4 page 469…Are you there, Mdm Quah?

> A:    Yes \[as spoken by the Witness in English\].

> Q:    Now, there’s a line that says, “15th Jan ODINT charge”. Do you see that? In the middle of the page.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    You will agree this stands for overdraft interest charge?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    In other words, you had withdrawn more from the bank than you had deposited?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, you owed the bank interest?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And in fact, \[your CashPlus Account\] was in overdraft all the way until it was closed on 19th April 2012?...

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, it was perpetually in overdraft?

> …

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And, again, this is one of the bank accounts that you said you deposited cash cheques into?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, again, you were paying interest on cash cheques belonging to \[the Company\]?

> A:    It’s not like this.

> Q:    Or you were depositing the cash cheques into an account that was perpetually in overdraft? Yes or no?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, you will agree with me that it’s illogical to pay interest on cash cheques that belonged to the company?

> Int:  “I disagree. Because \[TSM\] saw that I have \[overdraft\].”

> A:    Easier for him to take the money \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

> Int:  “I have OD bank.”

> Court:    She needs to keep her evidence in Mandarin.

> Int:  “My \[Cashline and CashPlus\] accounts both have \[overdraft\] interest. But \[TSM\] saw this and he wanted me to deposit the cash into this. So that it’s easier for him to take money.”

> A:    Anything happened \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

> Court:    In Chinese, please, Madam.

> A:    If there’s any problem, if there’s interest charge, sometimes \[TSM\] would help me to pay, sometimes, I will have to pay on my own. Because these 2 accounts have \[overdraft\], it will be easier for him to get the money. For those accounts…without \[overdraft\] line, he would not touch them.

> **Q:**      **Mdm Quah this very long and complicated explanation that you have just given – first time that you are giving this explanation. Yes? Yes or no?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    I’ll leave it as that. Now, without depositing cash cheques into \[your CashPlus and Cashline accounts you\] agree that the interest incurred would have been greater. Agree?

> A:    I disagree.

> Q:    That’s illogical, Mdm Quah.

> A:    Because I am in control of my own bank account. The reason I closed the \[CashPlus\] account \[was because TSM\] doesn’t want to have so many \[overdraft\] accounts for him to play around with. Because every time when I told him that there was \[overdraft interest\], I know that he would help me pay. Because I am letting him use my accounts. If there is no \[overdraft\] line, he wouldn’t touch them.

> **Q:**      **Alright, Mdm Quah, so now we have a brand-new explanation that \[TSM\], you let him use your accounts. That is what you just said. Agree or disagree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    And you agree this make\[s\] no sense because these are actually your bank accounts?

> A:    He did look at my bank accounts. Every time I bank in cheques and I receive bank statements, I will need to show it to him. I did ask him to bank into his own account. He said he does not have an ATM card. I want\[ed\] him to use his own Maybank account to issue cheques to the 3 \[directors\]. And he said, “It’s troublesome. They wanted cash.”

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

200    I did not give _any_ weight to Quah’s belated claims. I also did not see any sense in Quah borrowing money from credit lines on a monthly basis – and paying interest to the banks in respect of money that would not even go to her (but to TSM, as she claimed). This was also in light of the fact that Quah had a Savings Account, into which she could have deposited _all_ the cash cheques and not incur any interest (assuming that TSM did indeed instruct her to deposit the cash cheques into her accounts). Indeed, if TSM had been “chasing after \[her\] for money all the time”[^315] (as Quah claimed he was), it would surely have been faster for Quah to queue and encash the cash cheques over the counter at the banks (and get the cash there and then). Looking at the whole of the evidence, I agreed with the Prosecution that Quah was using the cash cheques she deposited into her credit lines to pay off her own debts[^316] and for her personal expenses.[^317]

##### Quah kept monies from Ho’s personal cheque

201    It was Quah’s case that _all_ the withdrawals she listed in her Compilation pertained _only_ to the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex (which she later encashed by depositing into her personal accounts).[^318] In cross-examination, she was referred to a cash cheque that Ho had issued from his _personal_ account (and not the accounts of EDS or Win Tran). Dated 8 July 2011, this cheque was for the sum of $4,100.65.[^319] Quah agreed that she had encashed this cheque on 8 July 2011 by depositing it into her Cashline Account.[^320] When asked if she had withdrawn the full sum of $4,100.65 to hand over to TSM, she testified that she withdrew _only_ a total of $1,500 (_ie_, leaving a balance of $2,600.65 in her account) to give to TSM. She did not explain why she only withdrew this smaller sum. Neither did she adduce any documentary evidence showing that she did actually pass this smaller sum to TSM. On this note, I bore in mind her evidence that her Compilation only covered the cash cheques she collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex. It did not cover cash cheques that Ho issued from his _personal_ account. Quah agreed with this as well in cross-examination:[^321]

> Q:    Alright, I’ll move on. Now, Mdm Quah, you can go with me to AB15.14? This is on page 708 of the bundle.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And can you also pick up AB2 at page 239? Are you there with me, Mdm Quah?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So the cash cheque of \[$4,100.65\] from Eric Ho, you agree that you banked this sum into your \[Cashline Account\]?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And we can see that on page 239 \[of AB2\]?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **But you did not, in fact, withdraw cash amounting to \[$4,100.65\] so that you could hand over the sum to \[TSM\]?**

> **A:**      **I only…withdrew $1,500.** Okay, I did deposit this sum of money and when I withdrew it, I also similarly, withdrew 500 and 1,000 to \[give to\] him.

> …

> **Q:**      **But actually, if you look at the cheque on page 708 \[of AB15\], it’s a cheque from Eric Ho.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And we agreed that \[your Compilation\], it relates to cash cheques from EDS, Win Tran and Time-Flex?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    So a cash cheque from Eric Ho would fall outside the scope of \[your Compilation\], you agree?

> A:    Can I take a look at \[my Compilation\]?

> **Q:**      **You don’t actually need to take a look at the documents for this, Mdm Quah. So just listen to the questions. Now, we are agreed that \[your Compilation\] concerns cheques from EDS, Win Tran and Time-Flex \[and\] not from Eric Ho.**

> **A:**      **I agree**, but sometimes Eric Ho would use his own personal cheque to pay the company although it’s very seldom.

> **Q:**      **Okay. Well, we’re actually going by what you said. So this is really your evidence that \[your Compilation\]…only had to do with EDS, Win Tran and Time-Flex.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

202    Quah’s evidence thus amounted to an admission that she did keep more than half of the sum encashed from this cheque (assuming that she did actually hand $1,500 to TSM). In any event, I placed _no_ weight on her evidence that she handed $1,500 to TSM. She never explained why she did not pass the full sum to TSM. It was also not her evidence that she passed TSM only $1,500 because she had already given him the remainder using her own cash (as she belatedly testified in respect of another cheque from Win Tran[^322]). In this vein, her evidence was also inconsistent with her earlier testimony that TSM was “chasing after \[her\] for money all the time”.[^323] If this was not a case where she had given TSM her own cash in advance, why did she fail to give TSM – who was allegedly always ravenous for money – the full sum from this cheque? This was simply another instance of Quah encashing a cash cheque for her own use.

##### Quah diverted cash cheque into mother’s account

203    In examination-in-chief, Quah was referred to one of her responses in her fifth investigation statement.[^324] This related to a cash cheque from EDS, for $3,067.75.[^325] The cheque was dated 29 October 2010. Behind this cheque, Quah had written to instruct the bank to deposit the _full_ sum into her mother’s account. The relevant extract from her statement read as follows:[^326]

> 13.    The following question was posed by the \[IO\]:

>> Q21?   I am showing you the same document, a transaction dated 29 October 2010, amounting to S$3067.75 using cheque OCBC 887776 paid by \[EDS\]. I am also showing you the cheque image from OCBC 887776 dated 29 October 2010 amounting to S$3067.75 and the recipient is one, Ms Tan Ah Nya. Can you explain why Tan Ah Nya is the recipient of the amount of S$3067.75 \[instead of the Company\]?

>> Answer:    Tan Ah Nya is my mother. I wish to state that this is one of the transactions that I **divert** the cash cheque to my mother\[‘s\] account. I had informed \[TSM\] about it and I had also reimbursed it in cash to \[TSM\]. My mother is 84 years old and wheelchair bound, \[a\] heart patient \[with\] slight dementia. There is a maid looking after her. Her bank account is maintained by me. It means that I would withdraw the money for her expenses She did not withdraw the money. As and when there is a need for her expenses, I would withdraw for her by ATM.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

204    Quah was then asked about her understanding of “divert”. She responded that she understood “divert” to mean “exchange”.[^327] In cross-examination, she stated that her statement should have stated “exchange” instead of “divert”.[^328] I was aware that the IO had testified that he did not clarify with Quah as to what she meant by her use of the word “divert”.[^329] However, it was never put to the IO that Quah had meant to use “exchange” instead of “divert” in her statement. In any event, I did not think that the IO had any reason to clarify the meaning of “divert” with Quah. This was in light of Quah’s clear proficiency in the English language.[^330] After all, she had informed the IO that her highest level of education was the GCE “A” Level and that she preferred to speak in English when her statements were recorded. The words “divert” and “exchange” are also very distinct in meaning. I found it difficult to understand how she could have been confused over their use. I was aware that Quah had claimed in her statement that:[^331]

> (a)     she had “informed” TSM about the diversion of this cash cheque into her mother’s account; and

> (b)     she had later “reimbursed” TSM the sum of $3,067.75 in cash.

205    However, these claims were never put to TSM. They were also inconsistent with Quah’s evidence that she had “no choice” but to give TSM her own money first because he was “chasing after \[her\] for money all the time”.[^332] If this were indeed the case, why would TSM permit Quah to first use the monies for her own purposes? I thus agreed with the Prosecution that this was “yet another clear instance of \[Quah\] treating the \[Entrusted Monies\] as her own”.[^333]

##### Quah’s fresh claims regarding monies in Joint Account

206    The joint account between Quah and her nephew was opened on 3 March 2014. She closed it in less than four months, on 27 June 2014. Quah’s transactions with this account from 31 March 2014 to 27 June 2014 appear in the following table:

207    In cross-examination, Quah was referred to four cash cheques issued by EDS between March 2014 and May 2014:

208    Quah _agreed_ that she had received all of these cash cheques (amounting to a total of $20,145.41) from EDS, and that she had deposited them into the Joint Account (corresponding to the cheque deposits shown in the bank statement[^334]). She also _agreed_ that she did _not_ withdraw the sums she encashed on each occasion to give to TSM (neither were such withdrawals shown on the bank statement).[^335] The Prosecution then directed Quah to her withdrawal of $50,000 from the Joint Account _via_ a cashier’s order on 11 June 2014.[^336] It was Quah’s evidence that she had obtained this order on 11 June 2014 in her _own_ name, and then deposited it into her Savings Account later that same day.[^337]

209    According to Quah, she had previously lent cash of $11,000 and $40,000 (_ie_, a total of $51,000) to TSM on two different occasions. She claimed that $11,000 was “for Eric Ho’s deposit” as Ho pumped more than $10,000 worth of diesel every month. The Company thus required a larger deposit from Ho, for EDS’s supply of diesel to continue on credit terms. Quah did not explain why she had to extend the loan of $40,000 to TSM.

210    Quah claimed that the cashier’s order for $50,000 was “what \[TSM\] returned to \[her\]” for the $51,000 she had previously lent him. She testified that TSM was aware that she had been banking these cash cheques into the Joint Account. She also said that TSM had asked her to bring this cashier’s order to the Office “for him to see” after she obtained it from the bank. She claimed that TSM had then made a copy of it in the Office and written the words, “I did not owe you anymore” on the copy (which she said he then retained). The Prosecution then suggested to Quah that she never had $50,000 to lend to TSM, given that her two remaining accounts were both credit lines. Quah disagreed:[^338]

> Q:    Now, you claimed that you lent $50,000 to \[TSM\]?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    But out of \[the\] 3 personal bank accounts of yours…\[the CashPlus Account\] was always in overdraft…agree or disagree?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And \[the other account\] was \[the Cashline Account\]?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, I’m suggesting to you that you never had $50,000 to lend to \[TSM\]?

> A:    I disagree.

211    Assuming that TSM was indeed returning $50,000 to her, the Prosecution then asked Quah why there was a need to _transfer_ this sum from her Joint Account to her Savings Account. After all, Quah could simply have let this sum remain in her Joint Account. Quah responded that she had her own reasons for doing so, but did not elaborate.[^339] In re-examination, she testified that her nephew’s father had entrusted her with $40,000 before he died to fund the studies of her nephew (who was studying in a local polytechnic). According to Quah, $40,000 out of the $51,000 she had lent to TSM therefore belonged to her nephew. She also claimed that her nephew’s school fees would be deducted from the Joint Account by GIRO. She further claimed that she transferred $50,000 from her Joint Account to her Savings Account because she did not want to “implicate” her nephew in “criminal breach of trust”. She testified that when she deposited $50,000 into her Joint Account, she had told TSM that $40,000 out of this sum of $50,000 did not belong to her (as she had “borrowed” this sum from her nephew). She claimed that TSM had responded by telling her to go to the bank to withdraw $50,000 in cash and pass the cash to him. He would then issue a cheque to her for this sum. However, she did not do this as she had already resigned and did not want to work anymore.[^340] Quah’s testimony on the $50,000 cashier’s order is set out at **Annex B** to these grounds.

212    I did not give any weight to Quah’s evidence. I was aware that Counsel did put certain questions to TSM regarding a loan of $40,000 and the Joint Account. These questions and TSM’s forceful denials are set out:[^341]

> Q:    \[TSM\], in 2012, did you take a loan of $40,000 from \[Quah\]?

> A:    No.

> Q:    Okay. My instruction\[s\] are that you took a loan \[of\] $40,000 from \[Quah\] in 2012. Do you agree or disagree?

> **A:**      **I disagree.**

> Q:    And then sometime from February or March 2014 to July 2014, you told her that she could keep the monies received from payments made \[by EDS\] to set off against the monies that you owed her. Do you agree or disagree?

> **A:**      **There’s no such thing.**

> Q:    Can you turn me with to \[the bank statement for the Joint Account\]? Okay. My instructions are that this \[statement in respect of the Joint Account\] sets out the cash cheques which were issued by \[EDS\]. And the cash cheques were deposited into these accounts. Are you aware?

> **A:**      **I do not know.**

> Q:    Okay. My instructions are that you did see this \[bank statement for the Joint Account\] before.

> **A:**      **No. I’ve never seen it.**

> …

> Q:    \[TSM\], if you look at the 4th line from the bottom, the date of 11th June 2014? Next to it there is an amount of $50,000 and if you continue reading across the line to the last column, it says, “Cashier’s Order”. So my instructions are that \[Quah\] drew out a Cashier’s Order of $50,000 and she also printed out a copy of this bank account statement. And she showed you both the Cashier’s Order and \[the bank account statement\].

> **A:**      **There’s no such thing at all.**

> Q:    And my instructions are that you told her she can keep this $50,000 Cashier’s Order and you would take it that you no longer owed her money. Do you agree or disagree?

> **A:**      **There’s no such thing, no.**

> Q:    And my instructions are that on the copy of this document which she printed out \[_ie_, the bank account statement in respect of the Joint Account\]. Both you and her actually signed off on it. Do you agree or disagree?

> **A:**      **I do not know \[about this\].**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

213    There was, however, _no_ mention that the loan which Quah had purportedly extended to TSM, also included the $11,000 security deposit the Company allegedly required from Ho.[^342] It was also difficult to understand why Quah (an employee of the Company) had to extend a personal loan of $11,000 to TSM on behalf of a customer of the Company. In this regard, I bore in mind Ho’s evidence that Quah had _never_ informed him of the need for any additional “security deposit”:[^343]

> Q:    Okay. Let’s move on to another point. Do you recall that Madam Quah had spoken to you before about a security deposit that the company required from you? A security deposit in the amount of $11,000?

> A:    No.

> …

> Q:    Okay. Mr Ho, you said that you had placed a deposit for the diesel chip, right?

> A:    Yup, mmm.

> Q:    And that was in the amount of $900?

> A:    Yah, yes, mmm.

> …

> **Q:**      **Subsequently, did \[Quah\] communicate to you that the company needed you to place more money as deposit?**

> **A:**      **Uh, no**, all the while she handle my account then she say she know how to handle as I got ask her \[if\] I need to approach \[TSM\] but she say, don’t have to, she know how to handle with \[TSM\].

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

214    There was no reason for Ho to lie. Neither did Quah advance one.

215    There were another inconsistency in Quah’s evidence. In cross-examination and re-examination, she had testified that TSM had written certain words on a photocopy of the cashier’s order she had allegedly passed him.[^344] However, it was put to TSM that he had done so on the bank statement relating to her Joint Account (_viz_., a _different_ document) that she had _also_ supposedly passed him.[^345] In addition, it was only in re-examination that Quah said that she had a scanned copy of this cashier’s order (on which TSM had apparently written certain words) in her computer.[^346] She also failed to mention the existence of this scanned copy, when she claimed that she had receipts proving that she handed $451,400 in cash to TSM.[^347] The circumstances leading to Quah bringing the cashier’s order to TSM in the Office were also not raised in her examination-in-chief and TSM’s cross-examination. This included her alleged conversation with TSM on not wanting to implicate her nephew.[^348]

216    Looking at the evidence as a whole, I agreed with the Prosecution that Quah never had $50,000 to lend to TSM. Given that her two remaining accounts were both credit lines, there was no objective evidence that she had the funds to do so. This was simply a case of her transferring misappropriated monies that had accumulated in her Joint Account to her Savings Account.

#### Entrusted Monies distinct from cash TSM received from Quah

217    In examination-in-chief, TSM testified that Quah was responsible for depositing the cash she collected from the Company’s customers into the Company’s Account. However, he also said that Quah would pass him small sums of cash in the range of $200 to $400 (being cash payments she had collected from the Company’s customers) five to seven times a month between 2009 and 2014. When these sums accumulated to a few thousand dollars, he would issue a personal cheque to return the money to the Company (the “Cash for Personal Cheque Practice”). It was his evidence that Quah would inform him of the sums due to the Company. She also wrote the sums on his personal cheque (based on her records). TSM testified that Quah “would write everything on his cheque and then after she’s done, \[he\] would \[just\] sign the cheque, and pass it back to her”. She would then bring his cheque to the bank and deposit it into the Company’s Account.[^349]

218    According to TSM, this practice had been in place even before Quah joined the Company. It was adopted because it was “very troublesome” for small sums of cash to be deposited into the bank every time they were received. TSM testified that he had initially recorded the sums that Quah passed him in the first six to seven years after she joined the Company. He ceased doing so thereafter because he trusted Quah. He was asked how he then knew if the sums Quah wrote on his personal cheques were correct. He replied that he trusted Quah because she had been working for him “for so long”. His evidence on these aspects is set out below:[^350]

> Q:    Did you have any way of keeping track of how much cash you received from \[Quah\] every month in this manner?

> A:    I did not record.

> **Q:**      **How then would you know that the amount \[Quah\] filled in on \[your personal\] cheque was correct?**

> **A:**      **Because she had been working for me for so long, I trusted her.**

> Q:    Did you write down how much cash you received anywhere?

> A:    Initially…not long after \[Quah\] joined the company, I did record this in a notebook. So, every month if the amounts are correct, I would erase it.

> **Q:**      **And can you clarify what timeframe or what year you are referring to? You said initially, not long after \[Quah\] joined. And she joined in 2000?**

> **A:**      **For the first 6 to 7 years, after that I trusted her, so I stopped recording.**

> **Q:**      **To the best of your recollection, do you have records of the cash you received from \[Quah\] between 2009 and 2014?**

> **A:**      **I did not record in the later part, because I trusted her.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

219    TSM’s account of the Cash for Personal Cheque Practice was supported by the cheque registers in his personal chequebooks (collectively, “the Cheque Registers”), which were admitted into evidence (**P22**). These Cheque Registers contained a record of all the cheques issued from TSM’s personal account[^351], and included the details of several cheques that TSM had issued to the Company during the offending period. Among these cheques were two that were dated 18 February 2014 and 24 March 2014. Images of these cheques were also admitted into evidence (**P23** and **P24**), and further supported the existence of this practice. These images showed that both cheques had been issued to the Company, and corresponded to rows in the Cheque Registers where the words “Exchange Cash – Clbus” had been written.[^352]

220    According to TSM, only three persons had written in his chequebooks during the offending period: himself; Fion; and Quah. [^353] That said, Fion would not make any entries in respect of the Company because she was not involved in the Company’s work. Save for his signatures on these two cheques, it was TSM’s evidence that he did not write the dates, the payee (_ie_, the Company), and the sums stated. He was sure of this because he could not write English.[^354] Given TSM’s _unchallenged_ evidence that it was Quah who had filled in these details[^355], I found that it was Quah who had written the dates, payee (_ie_, the Company), and the sums stated on these personal cheques. Quah had also agreed in cross-examination that she wrote these sums on TSM’s personal cheques.[^356]

221    It was TSM’s evidence that he adopted the Cash for Personal Cheque Practice for _all_ the cash payments he received from Quah:[^357]

> Q:    And did you do this, exchanging cash for \[personal cheque\] for **all** the cash that \[Quah\] handed to you?

> A:    Yes.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

222    It was hence TSM’s evidence that the personal cheques he issued to the Company _fully_ accounted for the cash payments he received from Quah.

223    Quah did _not_ challenge TSM’s evidence on the Cash for Personal Cheque Practice during his cross-examination. I noted that TSM’s evidence on the existence of this practice was also consistent with Fion’s evidence as to the existence of a similar practice at SINCL (which Quah did _not_ challenge as well).[^358]

224    However, when cross-examined, Quah denied that:[^359]

> (a)     all of the cash payments that TSM received from her were fully accounted for by way of the Cash for Personal Cheque Practice.

> (b)     the Entrusted Monies were distinct from the relevant sums stated in the Cheque Registers.

> (c)     the sums of cash recorded by TSM in the Cash Record Book was distinct from the Entrusted Monies.

225    In closing submissions, Counsel thus sought to link the Entrusted Monies and the relevant sums stated in the Cheque Registers:

> 18.    From 10 December 2009 to 24 March 2014, the total amount of cash which was recorded in \[the Cheque Registers as having been exchanged for \[personal\] cheques issued by TSM, in favour of the \[Company’s Account\] was **S$542,980**. Of this sum, the total amount that was deposited into the \[Company’s Account\] as recorded in the bank statements of the \[Company’s Account\] was **S$525,259.40**. A table setting out the total amount of cash recorded in the \[Cheque Registers\], as having been exchanged for \[personal\] cheques issued by TSM, in favour of the \[Company’s Account\], and the total sum that was deposited into the \[Company’s Account\] as recorded in the \[Company’s Account\] Statements, is annexed as **Annex C** to these Closing Submissions.

> …

> 69.    As stated in paragraph 18 above, the \[Cheque Registers\] demonstrate that from 10 December 2009 to 24 March 2014, at least **S$525,259.40** was accounted for by \[personal\] cheques issued by TSM, in favour of the \[Company’s Account\]. Although TSM tried, unsuccessfully, to downplay the sums of cash that he received, the \[Cheque Registers\] corroborate \[Quah’s\] evidence that the sums received by TSM were “_not small amounts_”, and we further elaborate on this in paragraphs 73 to 74 below.

> …

> 73.    We highlight, again, that while TSM and \[Quah\] are in agreement that she handed cash to TSM, their respective positions on the amount of cash that was handed to TSM, are different. In this regard:

>> (1)    TSM had tried to downplay the sums of cash that had been collected by \[Quah\] and handed to him, by alleging in his testimony that (a) \[Quah\] would only collect small amounts such as “_3 to $400_”, and that (b) this only took place, at most, “_6 to 7 times_” in a month. This is incredulous, and inconsistent with the \[Cheque Registers\]. As stated in paragraph 18 above, the \[Cheque Registers\] demonstrate that from 10 December 2009 to 24 March 2014 (a period of about 55 months), at least **S$525,259.40** has been accounted for by cheques issued by TSM, in favour of the \[Company’s Account\]. On average, therefore, \[Quah\] would have handed about S$10,000 each month to TSM. This is vastly inconsistent with TSM’s evidence that \[Quah\] would hand him, at the most, S$2,800 each month!

>> (2)    \[Quah\] has denied that it was only “_small amounts_” that were handed to TSM, and accounted for by cheques issued by TSM in favour of the \[Company’s Account\]. Her evidence is borne out by, and consistent with, the \[Cheque Registers\].

> 74.    It is apparent from the matters sets out in paragraph 73 above that TSM is an unreliable witness.

> 75.    The \[Cheque Registers\] are also incontrovertible evidence that cash from the Cash Collection Practice, Encashing Practice, and Cash Withdrawal Practice, was handed to TSM, and was accounted for by cheques issued by TSM, in favour of the \[Company’s Account\]. In this regard:

>> (1)    \[Quah\] collected at least **S$210,007.66** from the Cash Collection Practice, and handed this to TSM. A table setting out the respective \[Clients\], the amount paid by \[them\] in cash which was collected by \[Quah\], and handed to TSM, is annexed as **Annex D** to these Closing Submissions.

>> (2)    \[Quah\] would have collected at least **S$34,114.66** from the Encashing Practice, and handed this to TSM. A table showing the cash that was collected from the Encashing Practice, and handed to TSM, is annexed as **Annex E** to these Closing Submissions.

>> (3)    Pursuant to the Cash Withdrawal Practice, \[Quah\] withdrew **S$452,400** and handed this, together with her “_personal money_” to TSM.

>> (4)    Further, of the cash handed to TSM by \[Quah\], the \[Cheque Registers\] demonstrate that from 10 December 2009 to 24 March 2014, at least the sum of S$525,259.40 was accounted for by cheques issued by TSM, in favour of the \[Company’s Account\].

> \[emphasis in original\]

226    I did not find these submissions compelling. This was for three reasons.

##### Inaccurate conflation

227     First, I agreed with the Prosecution that this was an “inaccurate conflation of issues”.[^360] This was for two reasons.

TSM accounted for all cash received with personal cheques

228     One, it went against TSM’s _unchallenged_ evidence that he adopted the Cash for Personal Cheque Practice for _all_ the cash payments received from Quah. It was his evidence that the personal cheques he issued _fully_ accounted for these payments.

Entrusted Monies not banked into Company’s Account

229     Two, none of the Entrusted Monies had been banked into the Company’s Account. This was the _unchallenged_ evidence of the Special Auditor.[^361] Quah also admitted to this, twice, when cross-examined.[^362] The first occasion was at the outset of her cross-examination, when the Prosecution read out the sums stated in each charge:[^363]

> Q:    Now, Madam Quah, the amounts in the 5 charges against you have been read to you.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And these contain the sums that you are alleged to have been entrusted with and misappropriated. And just to make sure that we’re on the same page, I’m going to repeat the sums in each charge to you. So for the 1st charge, you’re alleged to have been entrusted with $174,166.12. For the 2nd charge, you’re alleged to have been entrusted with $169,974.60. For the 3rd charge, you are alleged to have been entrusted with $221,172.91. For the 4th charge, you’re alleged to have been entrusted with $127,104.40. And finally, for the 5th charge, you are alleged to have been entrusted with $233,403.66.

> A:    What is the total amount?

> Q:    The total amount is in excess of $900,000, Madam Quah. And you have heard clients of Chin Lin testify in Court that they paid money to you for all the relevant invoices that have been adduced in evidence, agree?

> A:    I disagree.

> Q:    Are you saying that you did not hear their evidence, Madam Quah?

> A:    I agree that they said this in Court.

> Q:    And you heard this from Eric Ho, Lee Fee Kun, Teo Tai Joo, Tan Kok Chuan, Ku Aik Beng, and Tan Yong Tiong?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And you agree that their evidence in this respect that they paid you for these relevant invoices was not challenged?

> A:    I agree.

> …

> Q:    You have heard IO Norazman testify that the sums in the charges---the sums in the charges that we went through earlier were summations of transactions marked “1” and “2” in the \[Clients’ Customer Transactions Records\], you agree?

> A:    I agree.

> **Q:**      **And you have also heard \[the Special Auditor explain\] that the amounts marked “1” and “2” were amounts paid by customers that were not banked into \[the Company’s Account\].**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And in fact, you yourself agree that these amounts---the same amounts that we’ve been talking about from the start of my questioning were not banked into \[the Company’s Account\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

230    The second occasion was towards the end of the second day of her cross-examination, when she was referred to EDS’s Customer Transactions Record:[^364]

> Q:    Now, I want you to go back to \[EDS’s Customer Transactions Record\] and that is page 646 of the bundle. Are you there, Mdm. Quah?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And I’m just going to remind you that you confirmed earlier in your testimony that you made all the accounting entries that have circles in one and circles in two next to them.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So I want you to focus on the second column from the right and that’s the column labelled, “Transaction Amount”. Do you see that, Mdm. Quah? Now, the negative figures under that column, they indicate that Chin Lin’s invoices had been paid, agree?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, for example, if you look with me at the 4th figure---4th figure from the top of that column. That is negative 5,881.96.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So this negative figure indicates that this amount, 5,881.96, have been paid by the client, correct?

> A:    Yes

> Q:    But you also agreed that these amounts were not banked into \[the Company’s Account\], correct?

> A:    I would need to look at the bank statement and the documents.

> **Q:**      **So you’ve agreed with me already, Mdm. Quah that A, you collected all the sums in the charges and B, they were not banked into \[the Company’s Account\]. So this is just one such sum which I’m now highlighting to you.**

> **A:**      **Yes. Because it’s not negative and there’s one OCBC cheque.**

> Q:    Yes, so you agree that this sum was paid by the client but not banked into the \[Company’s Account\]?

> A:    I cannot be sure because I do not know when the cash cheque---Eric Ho’s cash cheque was encashed unless I have the bank statement. I could tell you where this went to but if you look at this, two is debtor’s balance off set in…director’s loan account.

> **Q:**      **Now, Mdm Quah…before we go further, now, I just want you to focus on the question. So I’ve already explained to you that this is just one such sum which was not banked into the \[Company’s Account\] and this actually accords with your own evidence so I’m just telling you that now. And the \[Special Auditor\] also gave evidence that this was not banked into the \[Company’s Account\].**

> **A:**      **Alright.**

> **Q:**      **So can we agree that this sum $5,881.96 not banked into \[the Company’s Account\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes. Yes, because by the fact, that it’s number 2, it---it means that the debtors balance were offset in the director’s loan account, so…one can be sure that this did not go into the \[Company’s Account\].**

> **Q:**      **So on one hand, we have this account showing that all these negative amounts have been paid by clients, correct? All the negative figures.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And on the other hand, we are also in agreement that \[the Company’s Account bank\] statement shows that these amounts have not been banked in.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

231    Quah was not re-examined on these admissions. She also did not appear confused when she made these admissions. In closing submissions, however, Counsel argued that her admissions were based on a “misunderstanding”. Counsel contended that her admissions merely “acknowledge\[d\] that if the sums paid by the \[Clients\] were recorded…as being debited to the director’s loan account, \[then\] it could not \[also\] be debited to the…bank ledger”.[^365] In light of Quah’s clear admissions and the _unchallenged_ evidence of the Special Auditor[^366], I saw no merit to this argument. I agreed with the Prosecution that this “post-hoc explanation \[of a “misunderstanding” was\] an unmeritorious attempt to re-characterise \[Quah’s\] evidence”.[^367] In this regard, I considered – but rejected[^368] – Counsel’s submission that the Special Auditor’s conclusion that the Entrusted Monies were not deposited into the Company’s Account was “unsupported by the documentary evidence, unreliable, and simply cannot be taken at face value”.[^369] I set out the relevant paragraphs in Counsel’s submissions:

> 80.     Secondly, there are information gaps in \[the Special Auditor’s\] review. We explain as follows:

>> (1)    \[The Special Auditor\] has not, either in \[her conditioned statement\], or her testimony, testified that she was aware of the Cash Collection Practice, Encashing Practice, or Cash Withdrawal Practice.

>> (2)    There is no mention of whether \[the Special Auditor\] had considered the \[Cheque Registers\]. This is a glaring omission. It would be impossible to verify whether the cash from the Cash Collection Practice, Encashing Practice, and Cash Withdrawal Practice was handed to TSM, and subsequently accounted for by cheques issued to TSM, in favour of the \[Company’s Account\], without having reviewed the \[Cheque Registers\]!

> 81.     Thirdly, \[the Special Auditor’s\] crucial admissions during trial demonstrate that \[her conclusion\] simply cannot be taken at face value. In this regard:

>> (1)    \[The Special Auditor\] admitted that she did not even know that the sums paid by the \[Clients\] were accounted for in cash whether directly, or _via_ encashed cash cheques. Again, without having knowledge of this, it would be impossible to verify whether the cash from the Cash Collection Practice, Encashing Practice, and Cash Withdrawal Practice was accounted for by deposits into the \[Company’s Account\]…

>> (2)    \[The Special Auditor\] admitted that she could not “_establish if money received by the directors had been banked into the \[Company’s Account_”….

>> …

> 82.    \[The Special Auditor’s\] admissions that she did not notice that payments were made by \[the Clients\] in cash, and that she could not “establish if money received by the directors had been banked into the \[Company’s Account\], are crucial and significant admissions. The thrust of \[Quah’s\] case is that the cash from the Cash Collection Practice, the Encashing Practice, and the Cash Withdrawal Practice, was handed to TSM.

> \[emphasis in original\]

232    I rejected these submissions. They did not reflect the case that Quah advanced during the Special Auditor’s relatively brief cross-examination. In addition, they attempted to challenge – indirectly – the Directors’ unchallenged evidence that they had never borrowed money from the Company.[^370] In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution’s reply to these submissions – which I reproduce below:

> 11.     Third, the Defence’s claim at \[80\] of their closing submissions that there were “information gaps” in \[the Special Auditor’s\] review is flawed. The Defence did not describe the purported “Cash Collection Practice”, “Encashing Practice” and “Cash Withdrawal Practice” to \[the Special Auditor\], let alone put their case to \[the Special Auditor\] that \[Quah\] had engaged in these purported practices. The Defence also did not offer \[the Special Auditor\] an opportunity to comment on how these practices would have an impact, if any, on the findings and conclusions of her special audit. The “Cash Collection Practice”, “Encashing Practice” and “Cash Withdrawal Practice” \[were\] terms that the Defence introduced for the first time in their closing submissions.

> 12.    The Defence’s claim at \[80(2)\] of their closing submissions that \[the Special Auditor\] had not considered the \[Cheque Registers\] is also flawed. The Defence did not put their case regarding the \[Cheque Registers\] to \[the Special Auditor\], and cannot now belatedly seek to criticise her evidence on that basis.

> 13.    In addition, the Defence did not apply to recall \[the Special Auditor\] to cross-examine her _after_ the \[Cheque Registers\] had been admitted into evidence.

> 14.     Fourth, the Defence attempts to rely on \[the Special Auditor’s\] “admission” that she could not establish if money received by the \[Directors\] had been banked into the \[Company’s Account\] in support of their submission that \[the Special Auditor’s conclusion\] “cannot be taken at face value”. The Defence’s argument is a non-starter.

> 15.    The \[Directors of the Company, TSM, LEC, and NES\] have each _directly_ testified that they had never loaned money from \[the Company\] in the first place…Each \[had\] also testified as to his limited proficiency in English, and each \[had\] explained that he would sign the documents that \[Quah\] handed him based on what \[Quah had explained to him\]. The Defence cannot \[now belatedly\] challenge the veracity, weight and internal consistency of this direct evidence by attacking \[the Special Auditor’s\] evidence.

##### Belated attempt to link Entrusted Monies & Cheque Registers

233     Second, this attempt to link the Entrusted Monies and the relevant sums in the Cheque Registers was a very belated one. It also encompassed yet another fresh claim, which was not raised during TSM’s cross-examination. As the Prosecution pointed out:[^371]

> \[Quah\] never mentioned the \[Cheque Registers\] in \[any of\] her \[12\] police statements or \[in\] her evidence-in-chief. It was only \[at the tail end of her\] cross-examination that she belatedly attempted to claim that the \[Cheque Registers\] were related to the \[Entrusted Monies\]. It was **_never_** her defence that she handed the \[Entrusted Monies\] to TSM **and** that she would assist him to write personal cheques to the \[Company’s Account\] for _parts_ of these \[Entrusted Monies\]. Moreover, \[Quah\] herself agreed that she assisted with filling in the relevant cheques; she therefore must have known of the existence of the \[Cheque Registers\] long before they were adduced in evidence \[during the trial\], and _yet_ not raised them in her defence…

> \[emphasis added in original\]

##### No explanation for illogical & roundabout process

234     Third, it was difficult to understand why Quah (or any reasonable person) would engage in a roundabout process to deposit the cash from the cash cheques she collected into the Company’s Account. As the Prosecution noted:[^372]

> Taken at its highest, \[Quah’s\] defence is that that she handed over all of the \[Entrusted Monies\] in cash to TSM and/or…supplemented as necessary with her personal money. \[But, she\] offered no explanation for why she would engage in a protracted \[and circuitous\] practice of encashing \[cash\] cheques or depositing them into her \[three personal bank accounts\] and withdrawing the \[cash corresponding to these cash cheques\], handing the cash sums to TSM, and _then_ assisting him to write personal cheques back to the \[Company’s Account\]. She could have simply and rightly deposited the relevant \[cash\] cheques \[into the Company’s Account\] to begin with…

> \[emphasis in original\]

235    Quah never testified that TSM told her to engage in such an illogical process.

##### Quantum of sums in Cheque Registers irrelevant

236    Counsel argued that TSM was an “unreliable witness” because he had “tried to downplay the sums of cash” he received from Quah.[^373] I saw no merit to this. TSM never denied the sums stated in the Cheque Registers, and thus never “downplayed” them. It was also not his evidence that Quah “would hand him, at the most, S$2,800 each month”. More importantly, this argument missed the point. The key issue was whether the Entrusted Monies were distinct from the cash payments that TSM received from Quah, and _not_ their quantum. I therefore saw no reason not to give full weight to TSM’s evidence on the Cash for Personal Cheques Practice.[^374] I agreed with the Prosecution that the cash payments that TSM received from Quah were “entirely accounted for and separate from the \[Entrusted Monies\] which \[were\] the subject of the charges”.[^375] This thus meant that Quah never passed TSM the cash portion of the Entrusted Monies.

#### No explanation for what happened to remainder of Entrusted Monies

237     **Annex C** to these grounds is a breakdown of the Entrusted Monies. I have already considered, but rejected, Quah’s evidence in relation to her Compilation and the Summation[^376]. This was on the cash cheques she admitted to collecting from EDS, Win Tran and Time-Flex – which she did not deposit into the Company’s Account.

238    The Summation related, however, to only a sum of $569,788.89. This was but a portion of the Entrusted Monies. The remaining portion of the Entrusted Monies (amounting to a total of $350,032.80) comprised:

> (a)     cash payments (amounting to a total of $210,007.66) that Quah admitted to collecting from:

>> (i)       Tan Kok Chuan;

>> (ii)       Teo Tai Joo;

>> (iii)       Ku Aik Beng;

>> (iv)       Sin Kook Seng Enterprise; and

>> (v)       EDS.

> (b)     22 cheques (for a total sum of $140,025.14) that Quah admitted to collecting from:

>> (i)       Tan Yong Tiong (Sin Kook Seng Enterprise): one cash cheque;

>> (ii)       EDS: 18 cheques;

>> (iii)       Win Tran: two cheques; and

>> (iv)       Ho: one cheque.

239    Quah did not bank _any_ of this remaining portion of the Entrusted Monies into the Company’s Account. I had earlier found that the cash portion of the Entrusted Monies were distinct from the cash payments that TSM received from Quah (which were fully accounted for by TSM’s Cash for Personal Cheque Practice).[^377] Quah therefore never passed this cash portion of the Entrusted Monies to TSM. It was also Ho’s unchallenged evidence that he paid the Company by way of cash cheques only.[^378] This therefore meant that all 22 cheques that Quah collected (and which made up the remaining portion of the Entrusted Monies[^379]) were _cash_ cheques. Against this backdrop, I noted that Quah did not put forth any evidence in examination-in-chief on this remaining portion of the Entrusted Monies (unlike her Compilation). As the Prosecution noted, the “implicit admission \[therefore was\] that \[Quah was\] unable and/or unwilling to account for \[this remaining portion of the Entrusted Monies\]”.[^380]

240    That said, Counsel asserted in closing submissions that:

> 75.    …

>> (1)    \[Quah\] collected at least **S$210,007.66** from the Cash Collection Practice, and handed this to TSM. A table setting out the respective \[Clients\], the amount paid by \[them\] in cash which was collected by \[Quah\], and handed to TSM, is annexed as **Annex D** to these Closing Submissions.

> \[emphasis in original\]

241    But, as the Prosecution correctly observed, Quah “never testified that she had handed over all the sums \[stated\] in Annex D \[of the Defence’s Closing Submissions\] to TSM in her evidence-in-chief”.[^381] “Annex D” was also not put before TSM during his cross-examination. It only first appeared in Counsel’s closing submissions. The rule in _Browne v Dunn_[^382] was hence engaged. As reiterated by the Court of Appeal in _Harven a/l Segar v PP_[^383], the effect of the rule is that:

> …\[w\]here a submission is going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it has not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission.

242    I therefore did not give any weight to Counsel’s submission on “Annex D”.

#### Quah sought cash and/or cash cheques from Clients

243    In examination-in-chief:[^384]

> (a)     Tan Kok Chuan testified that Quah had suggested that he pay the Company in cash.

> (b)     Lee (from Time-Flex) testified that Quah had asked her to issue cash cheques “so that her TSM \[could\] bank in the cheque at any time”.

> (c)     Ho (from EDS and Win Tran) testified that Quah had asked him to pay the Company using cash cheques.

244    In cross-examination, the Special Auditor testified that TSM had informed her and Heng at the meeting before the special audit that he had learnt from Ho that:[^385]

> …EDS was issuing…cash cheques…for payment of outstanding invoices rather than…issuing…crossed cheques payable to \[the Company\].

245    Quah did not challenge these aspects of the evidence. I was aware that she had testified that TSM wanted her to collect cash cheques from:[^386]

> (a)     Time-Flex as it had cash flow problems; and

> (b)     EDS “to make it more convenient for \[TSM\] to collect the cash.”

246    But, this was never put to TSM – even though Counsel stated that it was a fact that Quah intended to rely on.[^387]

247    In examination-in-chief, Ho testified that Quah would sometimes[^388] ask if he had “hard cash” after he had _already_ passed her a cash cheque to pay the Company. If he did, she would ask to “exchange” his cash cheque for cash. She would then return the cash cheque to him after receiving the equivalent amount of cash from Ho.[^389] In this regard, the Prosecution referred Ho to a cash cheque (**P6**) issued from Win Tran’s account.[^390] This cheque was dated 15 April 2011 and for the sum of $2,750. It was not disputed that the Company never received this sum. It was Ho’s evidence that Quah had returned this cheque to him when he passed her $2,750 in cash. According to Ho, he had initially passed Quah a signed cheque with just the figure of $2,750 typed on it. When Quah returned the cheque to him after he had passed her $2,750 in cash, she had already written the date and the word “cash” in the payee section of the cheque. I set out Ho’s evidence:[^391]

> Q:    But this cheque was supposed to be for payment for diesel?

> A:    Yes. As \[Quah\] request me to pass her the hard cash in order to give back my cheque.

> **Q:**      **Okay. So this was an instance where \[Quah\] returned the cheque to you, is that correct?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So who requested this? Did you request the return of the cheque or did she \[?\]**

> **A:**      **She call me.**

> **Q:**      **\[A\]nd what did \[Quah\] tell you?**

> **A:**      **She told me that “Do you have hard cash?” I say “Have”. So, she asked me to withdraw the $2,750 and pass to her. At the same time, \[she\] will return the cheque to me.**

> Q:    Now, earlier you explained that when you gave the cheque to \[Quah\] you had only filled in your signature and the amount. When the cheque was returned to you, what else was filled in?

> A:    Before I pass to \[Quah\] the cheque it’s blank cheque…I only sign and write the figure amount. When the day \[she\] call me for the hard cash, I passed her the hard cash, she passed me back the cheque, I return by her, the cheque and the cross and the date itself.

> **Q:**      **So just to make sure that I’ve got that correctly, you said that when she returned it to you, there was the word cash, the cross and the date.**

> **A:**      **Yah.**

> Q:    What about the back of the cheque?

> A:    No, the back is written by me.

> Q:    And what did you do with the cheque after you had filled in the details on the back?

> A:    I deposit to my wife account.

> Q:    And to confirm, did you give the equivalent sum in cash to \[Quah\]? So $2,750?

> A:    Yah.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

248    In cross-examination, Ho denied initiating the return of this cheque to Quah. He reiterated that it was Quah who had called him to ask for cash in return for this cheque:[^392]

> Q:    Okay. Okay, can you take up P6? P6 is a cheque image for the sum of $2,750...Okay earlier in your evidence, you said that \[Quah\] had asked you for cash to return this cheque to you?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **Okay. Were you the one who first contacted \[Quah\] to ask for a return of this cheque?**

> **A:**      **Uh, no \[she\] call me to meet…her at…Bukit Batok Central.**

> Q:    Okay. I put my instructions to you, okay? My instructions are that, for this cheque, you were the one who contacted her first to ask for this cheque to be returned, you can agree, disagree or you can say…you can’t remember.

> A:    \[D\]isagree.

> Q:    …Okay. So she then told you that she can return this cheque to you but first you have to give her cash, so that she can use it as your payment to the company?

> A:    In---yah.

> Q:    So, that’s a yes?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **Okay. Let’s just clarify because, we are trying to determine…who initiated the return of this cheque, okay? So my instructions are that, you asked first for this cheque to be returned and then she asked you for the cash, so that, the cheque can be returned to you?**

> **A:**      **No, it’s like…\[she\] asked me to pay cash to her at the same time, give back the cheque to me.**

> Q:    Yes. So that’s what eventually happened, right?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So what we…are trying to understand is who initiated this event that had occurred, because my instructions are that, you first contacted Madam Quah to ask for this cheque to be returned.**

> **A:**      **Of course, she is the one who call me…is she \[who\] need hard cash…**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

249    I accepted Ho’s evidence. He had no reason to lie. There was no need for him to initiate the return of this cheque and pay cash to Quah, when he had (essentially) already passed her a cheque for this same sum. That Quah had written the word “cash” in the payee section of the cheque (when she returned the cheque to Ho) was not disputed. There was hence no reason why Quah could not have deposited this cheque into the Company’s Account (or any of her personal bank accounts, as she claimed TSM instructed her to). I found that it was Quah who initiated the return of this cheque in exchange for cash on hand – which she could more easily, and did in fact, misappropriate. It was of not fortuitous that the modes of payment Quah suggested/dictated[^393] (cash and cash cheques) were those that were misappropriated.

#### Quah manipulated accounting records to hide misappropriation

250    The Company never cancelled or voided concluded sales transactions with its customers.[^394] Quah confirmed this as well:[^395]

> **Q:**      **…Now, Mdm Quah, in your long experience with \[the Company\], has any customer ever cancelled a sales transaction?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> Q:    So I just want to be clear about this point because \[the Company\] sells diesel, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So in your experience, has anyone ever pumped diesel into their vehicle \[and\] then left and then came back and ask\[ed\] for a refund?

> A:    No.

> **Q:**      **Has anyone ever tried to return the diesel pump\[ed\] into their vehicle?**

> **A:**      **It’s not possible.**

> **Q:**      **So the answer is no?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **So definitely no cancelled sales transactions?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

251    The accounting entries corresponding to the Missing Payments debited to the “OTHER INCOME” account (marked on the Clients’ Customer Transactions Records) were therefore false. This was because they suggested that the Company had cancelled concluded sales transactions with the Clients.[^396] Quah also admitted that these entries did not reflect the true state of affairs:[^397]

> Q:    And in fact, you agreed with me earlier that no customer of \[the Company\] had cancelled a completed sales transaction. Yes or no?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    In fact, you agreed that it’s not possible.

> A:    It’s not possible. After you pumped the diesel, it’s not possible to cancel.

> **Q:**      **So the entries marked one, they don’t reflect the true state of affairs, correct?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **Because there were, in fact, no cancelled sales transaction.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

252    The Directors never borrowed money from the Company.[^398] The accounting entries corresponding to the Missing Payments debited to the “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” account (marked on the Clients’ Customer Transactions Records) were therefore _also_ false – because they suggested that the Directors had received these payments (and not the Company) and therefore owed these sums to the Company.[^399]

253    Quah had made _all_ of these incriminating entries on ACCPAC.

254    When cross-examined, Quah claimed that TSM had instructed her to make these entries. I noted that this was somewhat consistent[^400] with her examination-in-chief, where she said that she had to meet TSM on the third day of every month for him to review the invoices she had prepared and the Clients’ Customer Transactions Records.[^401] Referring to the accounting entries marked on the Clients’ Customer Transactions Records), she claimed that TSM had told her sometime in 2009 during their monthly meetings[^402] that he did “not want to put \[certain\] sale figure\[s\] into the sales account, but “want\[ed\] \[her\] to transfer \[these figures\] to \[other\] income.”[^403] She said that she did as TSM directed. However, she also claimed that she did tell TSM that she did not agree with this practice. She said that TSM responded that “\[she\] was only an employee \[and\] \[h\]e wanted to distribute these monies to the other bosses, so he asked \[her\] to do as \[told\].”[^404]

255    However, TSM denied having discussions with Quah where he would review the general ledgers of the Company (which included the “OTHER INCOME” and “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” ledgers[^405]). He also forcefully testified that he had never seen the Clients’ Customer Transactions Records before:[^406]

> Q:    \[TSM\], tab 8 to tab 13 are the company’s customer transaction\[s\] \[record\]. For tab 8, it is for \[EDS\] and you can see that name at the top of the documents. Okay, my instructions are that on the 3rd day of every month, this document would have been reviewed by you?

> A:    No.

> Q:    If you turn with me to tab 9, this is the customer transactions record for Sin K\[oon\] Seng Enterprise. And on the discussion on the 3rd day of every month, you would have reviewed this document as well.

> A:    No.

> Q:    Let’s turn to tab 10. Tab 10 is the customer transactions record for \[Time-Flex\]. On the 3rd day of every month, at the discussion that you have with \[Quah\], you would also have reviewed this document?

> **A:**      **I’ve never seen these things. So even if you ask about the rest, \[my\] answer will be the same. There’s no need to ask so many \[questions\].**

> Q:    Now, let’s look at tab 11, tab 12, and tab 13. These are the customer transactions records for Teo Tai Joo, Tan Kok Chuan, and Ku Aik Beng respectively. So my instructions are that at the discussion on the 3rd day of every month, you would have also reviewed these documents?

> **A:**      **Just now I have said never...so…no matter how much you ask, it’s still no.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

256    TSM also denied that he would instruct Quah to:[^407]

> (a)     reverse customer payments that he selected into the “OTHER INCOME” ledger; and

> (b)     record customer payments that he selected under the “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” ledger.

257    TSM further denied that Quah had expressed her discomfort with these alleged practices. I set out his evidence in cross-examination:[^408]

> **Q:**      **And I put it to you \[that\] at this discussion on the 3rd day of every month, you would also review the general ledgers of the company.**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **…You would then instruct \[Quah\] to reverse payments from customers that you select\[ed\] into the general ledger of other income? Okay, I’ll repeat the question again**.

> DPP:  Your Honour, apologies. Just for clarity, is my learned friend referring to documents that have been admitted? If so could we just have the reference? Is he referring to AB38 and AB39?

> DC:    Your Honour, my instructions are that the general ledger as a whole and if Your Honour recalls \[when\] the auditors gave their evidence – general ledgers actually have different accounts. So my instructions are that the entire set was discussed at the meeting which I’m putting to \[TSM\] now.

> DPP:  Grateful to my learned friend.

> **A:**      **There’s no such thing ever.**

> **Q:**      **And you would have also selected certain customer payments to be recorded under director’s loan account instead?**

> **A:**      **No, I disagree. I’ve never known this.**

> **…**

> **Q:**      **And my instructions are that when \[Quah\] told you that she was not comfortable with this practice, you told her that she was only an employee?**

> **A:**      **There’s no such --- there’s never such thing.**

> **Q:**      **And you told her to just do as you had instructed her. And the monies were for you to go and deal with the other directors.**

> **A:**      **There’s no such thing. Can I say something? My mistake was that I trusted her too much. If I had not gone for the heart surgery, this wouldn’t have happened. So no matter how much you asked me now, there’s no meaning to this.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

258    I accepted TSM’s evidence. I also disbelieved Quah’s account, as it was incredible in light of my findings that:

> (a)     TSM’s proficiency in the English language (the language used in ACCPAC) was very limited[^409]; and

> (b)     TSM did not know how to use a computer or operate ACCPAC.[^410]

259    I set out Quah’s unbelievable account, for its incredulity to be appreciated:[^411]

> Q:    …Now, Mdm Quah, when you refer to other income and director’s loan ledgers in these proceedings, you’ve actually been referring to those terms in English \[when you testify in Court\], you agree?

> …

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And that’s because you \[are\] not very sure what these words are in Mandarin, you agree?

> A:    I’m not sure.

> …

> Q:    Now, you agree that \[TSM\] would have given you instructions, if any, in Mandarin.

> A:    No.

> **Q:**      **So you are saying that \[TSM\] knew how to refer to “other income” and “director’s loan ledger” in English?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **I suggest \[to\] you, this is highly improbable given \[TSM’s\] limited English capacity.**

> **A:**      **I disagree.**

> Q:    Now, we are agreed on the fact that all one\[s\] and \[twos\] in \[the Customer Transactions Record of each Client\], all these are amount not banked into the \[Company’s Account\]?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **It must follow that if \[TSM\] had to instruct you which entries to mark as one and two, he had to do the following. Step 1, he would have to access ACCPAC.**

> **A:**      **Yes…and he did.**

> **Q:**      **Step 2, he would have to confirm which sums paid had not been banked into \[the Company’s Account\].**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And step 3, he would have to decide which of these entries to mark as one and two.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **In other words, he would have to decide which entries to reverse in other income?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And which entries to debit to the director’s loan accounts? Just yes or no, please, Mdm Quah.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And this is despite the fact that \[TSM\] has given evidence that he did not even check the \[Company’s Account\].**

> A:    Is that even possible?

> Q:    You have heard his evidence, have you not, Mdm Quah?

> A:    I did.

> **Q:**      **And you have also heard his evidence that he did not know how to use ACCPAC?**

> **A:**      **I did.**

> **Q:**      **So your evidence, Mdm Quah, I’m giving you a chance to confirm, is that \[TSM\], a Primary 3-level educated man, \[who\] does not know how to turn on a computer, told you to do all of these?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    I suggest to you that this is –

> A:    He knows.

> Q:    incredible.

> A:    I disagree.

> Q:    So I ask you to confirm one more time for the record, your Defence is, basically, now that \[TSM\] was lying in Court.

> A:    Yes.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

260    Having reviewed the totality of the evidence, I agreed with the Prosecution that the irresistible inference was that Quah independently and unilaterally manipulated the accounting records to conceal her dishonest misappropriation of the Entrusted Monies. This evidenced her dishonesty.[^412] As the Prosecution forcefully argued:

> 46    …

>> (c)    \[T\]he accounting entries on ACCPAC which correspond to the \[Entrusted Monies\] \[did\] not reflect the true state of affairs. None of the relevant sales transactions had been cancelled or refunded. None of the relevant directors (TSM, LEC and NES) had loaned money from \[the Company\]. Further, TSM did not even know to use ACCPAC. It is incredible to suggest that TSM had instructed \[Quah\] to manipulate the accounting entries on ACCPAC in a relatively sophisticated manner when he had no English proficiency and could not even operate a computer. The only logical conclusion is that \[Quah\] had independently manipulated the accounting entries to avoid detection.

261    In reply submissions, Counsel argued that the Prosecution was wrong in this submission.[^413] Counsel’s arguments were set out in detail in his closing submissions. The relevant extracts appear below:

> 119.  \[The Audit Firm\] was aware of the \[irregular entries corresponding to the Missing Payments debited to the “OTHER INCOME” account and the “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” account\]. In the course of \[preparing\] the Audited Accounts, \[the Audit Firm\] reviewed the general ledgers of \[the Company\], including the \[“OTHER INCOME” and “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” accounting ledgers[^414]\]. This was confirmed by \[Heng\] explicitly. The relevant extract \[from Heng’s cross-examination\] is as follows:[^415]

>> Q:    So, in addition to the management accounts, your staff would have also taken a look at the ---at the least, the \[“OTHER INCOME” and “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” accounting ledgers\], right?

>> A:    Yes.

> …

> 124.  \[T\]he documentary evidence is incontrovertible that TSM, LEC, and NES, were aware of the \[irregular entries corresponding to the Missing Payments debited to the “OTHER INCOME” account and the “AMOUNT OWING BY DIRECTORS” account\]. In this regard:

>> (1)    The \[Audited Accounts of the Company for the financial years ending on 30 June 2011, 30 June 2012, 30 June 2013, and 30 June 2014\] were prepared by \[the Audit Firm\], which signed off on each of the Audited Accounts.

>> (2)    TSM signed on each of these \[Audited Accounts\], stating that these represented a “_true and fair view of the state of affairs of \[the Company\]_”.

>> (3)    Further, for the financial years ended 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014, TSM, LEC, and NES each verified the amount owing by them to \[the Company\]. These Audit Verification Letters were each counter-signed by another director, and confirmed by the directors from whom the money was owing…

> \[emphasis in original\]

262    I reiterate my findings that:[^416]

> (a)     Quah failed to explain the contents and significance of the audit verifications she gave the Directors to sign.

> (b)     the Directors trusted Quah when they signed these verifications.

263    I therefore did not think that the mere fact that the Directors signed the audit verifications was “incontrovertible” evidence that they were in fact aware of the irregular entries on ACCPAC. Neither were the Audited Accounts (on which the verifications were based) such evidence. As Heng explained, the irregularities discovered during the special audit were not detected during the general audits because Quah had entered the figures into the accounting records “like any other ordinary figure” and the “accounting records \[were\] full of figures”. Unless a “very detailed” and directed check was done, one was “not likely” to uncover anything. I set out Heng’s evidence:[^417]

> Q:    Looking at these \[irregular\] entries \[marked\] 1 and 2…why were these not flagged out in the annual \[general\] audit\[s\] of \[the Company\]?

> A:    \[U\]nder normal audit procedures, we did not detect these matters.

> Q:    Can you explain why these matters were not detected?

> A:    Because…those figures \[had been\] enter\[ed\] into the book like any other ordinary figure, and the accounting records \[were\] full of figure\[s\]. Unless, you do a very detailed \[directed check\], you are not likely to be able to find out anything.

264    In addition, Quah did not challenge TSM’s evidence on Heng’s explanation as to why the irregularities were not detected during the general audits. According to TSM, Heng had told him that “he would just pick and choose, selectively check. If there had been problems, \[and Quah\] had given him some explanation, he would let it off and not probe further”:[^418]

> Q:    So \[before LEC lodged the Company’s Police Report\], what did \[the Audit Firm\] give you?

> A:    \[The Audit Firm\] told us that the accounts were not right.

> Q:    And did they say what was not right about it?

> A:    He said there were a lot of discrepancies in the accounts that he has checked.

> Q:    Who from \[the Audit Firm\] told you that?

> A:    \[Heng\] himself.

> **Q:**      **And did you then ask \[Heng\] why these discrepancies were not picked up earlier?**

> **A:**      **I did ask \[Heng\], “You were…checking the accounts, yet how can you not know that….you have been checking for such a long time and you didn’t even know that the accounts were wrong?” So \[Heng\] said that he…would just pick and choose, selectively check. If there had been problems, if \[Quah\] had given him some explanation, he would let it off and not probe further.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

265    In these circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that Quah:[^419]

> …was in fact initially successful \[in hiding her misappropriation of the Entrusted Monies\], given that the discrepancies were not picked up in the general audits between 2009 and 2014, and only came to light after she…left \[the Company\] and \[the\] special audit was commissioned.

### Red herrings

266    During the course of the trial, Quah alleged that TSM:

> (a)     had terminated her employment because:[^420]

>> (i)       he had found out that she was preparing a document that recorded information of cheques issued from the Company’s Account to him (the “MBB Cheques Document”).[^421]

>> (ii)       she had made a police report against him alleging sexual harassment.[^422]

> (b)     had directed LEC to make the Company’s Police Report as he “bore a grudge”[^423] against her.

267    TSM denied these allegations. He also testified that he had never seen the MBB Cheques Document before.[^424] In any event, I found these allegations irrelevant to Quah’s criminal liability. I now elaborate.

#### MBB Cheques Document not related to Quah’s charges

268    Quah had first produced the MBB Cheques Document when her first investigation statement was recorded.[^425] However, she confirmed in her fourth investigation statement[^426] that it had nothing to do with the sums that were the subject of the charges against her (_viz_., the Entrusted Monies):

>   
| 

Q18?

 | 

Can I confirm that the \[MBB Cheques Document relates to\] a separate issue and not the missing cash the Police are investigating?

 |
| 

Answer:

 | 

**I confirmed that the \[MBB Cheques Document\] I produced had got nothing to do with the sum of S$900,000 that Police are investigating.** My purpose of producing this document \[is\] to show…the Police that \[TSM\] also took company money[^427] without the knowledge of the 3 other directors.

 |
| 

\[emphasis added in bold\]

#### No allegation that TSM framed Quah after police report

269    In her second police report, Quah had alleged that TSM had started to accuse her of misusing the Company funds after she lodged her police report alleging sexual harassment.[^428] Her case at trial was, however, different. During the trial, she alleged that TSM terminated her employment because of her police report alleging sexual harassment. It was therefore not her case at trial that TSM had framed her because of this report. Indeed, this line of questioning was not pursued at trial. In any event, I did not place any weight on this police report in assessing TSM’s credibility[^429] – given that no further action was taken against TSM in respect of Quah’s allegations.[^430]

#### Audit Firm & lawyers suggested Company file police report

270    There was no merit in Quah’s assertion that TSM had directed LEC to make the Company’s Police Report as he “bore a grudge” against her. In examination-in-chief, TSM was asked about the circumstances leading to the Company’s Police Report. He testified that the Company had employed someone new to take over the accounts after Quah’s departure. This person had said that he was not able to do so, and asked TSM what to do. As TSM did “not know about the accounts”, he instructed the Audit Firm to check. TSM was then informed at a subsequent meeting with Heng that nearly a million dollars was missing. Heng told him to report the matter to the police and to engage a lawyer to help him handle the matter.[^431] TSM’s evidence was not challenged. It was also consistent with LEC’s and Fion’s evidence (which was not challenged as well) that it was the Audit Firm that told the Directors to report the Company’s accounting irregularities to the police.[^432]

271    In cross-examination, TSM denied that the Audit Firm’s auditors spoke to him in the course of their general audits about the records in the Company’s general ledger.[^433] He also explained why he did not make an earlier complaint to the Audit Firm or the police (which I accepted):[^434]

> Q:    And the fact of the matter was that you were keeping track of customer’s payments and you were keeping track of the monies actually received by the \[C\]ompany. And that is why you have never \[made\] any complaint to the police or the auditors, do you agree?

> A:    But **when I check you must know what I checked. I only checked that to make sure that these customers are not owing money for too long.** Because if the debts \[are\] for more than 2 or 3 months then…I must chase after them …if not I won’t have enough money to make payment \[to the diesel company\]. So I cannot allow payment to be dragged on for too long.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

272    In these circumstances, I placed no weight on the fact that TSM had not lodged the Company’s Police Report personally. Quah had appeared to suggest that TSM was somehow less credible because “\[e\]ven though TSM was obviously the appropriate party to lodge \[the report\] in respect of the unaccounted for amount, he instructed LEC to \[do so\]”.[^435] In examination-in-chief, TSM explained that he did not lodge the report personally as he was busy. He also testified that he thought that the police would investigate the matter fairly, regardless of who reported it to the police.[^436] In addition, he gave unchallenged evidence that he did not:

> (a)     give LEC any documents to pass to the police;

> (b)     give Fion any instructions about lodging the report; and

> (c)     discuss with LEC what should be reported.[^437]

273    In cross-examination, TSM testified that he was busy as he had a golf tournament. However, he disagreed that he did not lodge the Company’s Police Report personally because he “didn’t really care much about the matter against \[Quah\]”. He explained that he trusted the police to be fair in its investigations. It therefore did not matter who lodged the report. I set out TSM’s evidence:[^438]

> Q:    Okay, Mr Tan, I’m going to put it to you. The fact that you were going for a social activity instead of lodging the police report yourself shows that you didn’t really care much about this matter against Mdm Quah Siew Hong.

> A:    I disagree.

> Q:    Now, if you were really concerned, you should have made the report to the police yourself, right?

> **A:**      **Because just now I have already explained, I was thinking I had trust in our police to be fair in this. So it doesn’t matter who made the report. It will be the same. \[I\]t’s not that if I go and report this myself, I will get some special treatment.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

274    I accepted TSM’s explanation, which I found credible. One would have expected TSM to lodge the report personally (instead of asking LEC to do so) if he did indeed bear a “grudge” against Quah (or, to at least give directions to LEC or Fion as to what to report). In any event, I noted the inconsistency in Quah’s case. On the one hand, she alleged that TSM had directed LEC to make the Company’s Police Report as he “bore a grudge” against her. Yet, on the other hand, she alleged that TSM did not lodge the report personally because he “didn’t really care much about the matter against \[her\]”.

#### Immaterial that Company had yet to bring civil action against Quah

275    In cross-examination, TSM’s attention was drawn to the Demand Letters. The third letter stated that the Company’s lawyers had been instructed to commence legal action against Quah[^439], and TSM testified that he had fully authorised them to do so.[^440] It was not disputed that the Company had not commenced such action by the time the trial commenced, notwithstanding this third letter. It was then put to TSM that the Company “eventually…did not sue \[Quah\] because \[it\] did not have a genuine claim against her”. TSM forcefully disagreed with this suggestion, and explained why the Company had refrained from filing a civil claim against Quah. I set out TSM’s evidence:[^441]

> Q:    Now, Mr Tan, \[the third letter\] makes it very clear that…the \[Company’s\] lawyers will go in to sue Madam Quah.

> A:    Initially, I was told that \[the Company’s lawyers were\] going to sue her but later \[they\] told me that they are handing this over to the police.

> Q:    Now, Mr Tan. I’m going to put it to you that eventually the \[Company\] did not sue Madam Quah…because the \[Company\] did not have a genuine claim against her.

> A:    I disagree. I disagree.

> Q:    If the \[Company\] was sure that this money had been taken by Madam Quah, you would have caused the \[Company\] to sue her.

> A:    I disagree.

> Q:    The fact that a lawsuit was not started against her shows that actually, there is no claim against her for the sum of $974,020.94.

> A:    I disagree \[that\] I’m not suing her. I want to sue her.

> **Q:**      **Now, you say you want to sue her but it’s been more than 3½ years.**

> **A:**      **Because the lawyer explained to me that if we sue her, it will be very difficult for us to get a lot of the evidence. So if the government is going to investigate this, it will be much faster than \[if\] we did.**

> **Q:**      **Earlier you said it will be difficult to get evidence. What do you mean by that?**

> **A:**      **Because the lawyer said that we would have to get our clients’ bank whatever. So it’s very difficult to get.**

> Q:    Mr Tan, so basically, are you saying that you were not sure whether the \[Company\] even had a claim against Madam Quah?

> A:    That’s why I handed this over to the police. \[The police\] will be fair. And then after that, I can sue her.

> Q:    So, Mr Tan, at the end of the day you are saying that when the police report was lodged, you didn’t have any evidence against her.

> A:    When I reported this to the police, there was only this figure that was being checked by \[the Audit Firm\]. Initially, I didn’t know that the accounts would be done so ridiculously. **So when \[the Audit Firm\] checked this out and \[it\] told me to go to the police and my lawyers also told me to report this to the police.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

276    TSM’s evidence was consistent with the evidence that the Company’s Police Report was only filed at the suggestion of the Audit Firm and the Company’s lawyers.[^442] That said, the fact that the Company had yet to file a civil claim against Quah was, at best, a neutral point. The present case involved the determination of Quah’s criminal liability on the evidence presented before this court. It was irrelevant that a civil action, an entirely separate proceeding calling for the proof of different elements, had yet to be taken by the Company. Even if the Company had filed a civil claim against Quah, that was irrelevant to Quah’s criminal liability. In any event, I found that TSM’s explanation as to why the Company had yet to pursue a civil claim against Quah was reasonable.

#### TSM’s supposed status as a “shrewd businessman”

277    In cross-examination, TSM was referred to a “People Profile” search (**D12**) that listed his current appointments. This indicated that he was:

> (a)     a director of a third company, that operated from the same premises as the Company and SINCL;

> (b)     an ordinary shareholder of two other companies (apart from the Company and SINCL); and

> (c)     the owner of “SIN CHIN LIN TRADING”.

278    It was TSM’s unchallenged evidence that “SIN CHIN LIN TRADING” was “registered but there was not much business being done”.[^443] .

279    The “People Profile” search also listed TSM’s past appointments. It indicated that he had been a director of 11 other companies as well as owner and/or manager of three companies. TSM agreed that he had many business activities. However, he disagreed that he was therefore a shrewd businessman. He explained as follows:[^444]

> **A:**      **I have a lot of business but…only in name. I wasn’t the one who was actually doing them. If I’m a shrewd businessman, I would \[not\] have lost all the monies that I’ve earned in my life.**

> Q:    Mr Tan, I put it to you that you are a shrewd businessman.

> **A:**      **I am not shrewd otherwise I wouldn’t have money missing. I wouldn’t…have lost my money.**

> Q:    And I put it to you that because you are a shrewd businessman, you would have ensured that \[for\] customers who made payment to \[the Company\] \[t\]he money would have actually been received by the company?

> **A:**      **I can put it this way. My failure was that I trusted people too much. That was why I failed, that was why I had money missing.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

280    TSM’s explanation that he had “a lot of business but…only in name” and that he “wasn’t the one who was actually doing them”[^445] was not challenged. In these circumstances, I did not think that the “People Profile” search went any way to showing that TSM was in fact a “shrewd businessman”.

#### TSM had no reliable system to verify/monitor cash received

281    TSM testified that he had ceased having oversight of Quah’s work by the time of the offending period.[^446] In reply submissions, Counsel asserted that TSM’s testimony was “internally inconsistent with other parts of TSM’s evidence, and externally inconsistent with Fion’s testimony”.[^447] In this vein, Counsel submitted that:

> 5.    …Between 2009 and 2014, TSM supervised \[Quah’s\] work in the following manner:

>> (1)    TSM received cash from \[Quah\] from the Cash Collection Practice, Encashing Practice, and the Cash Withdrawal Practice, and recorded his receipt of the cash in his \[Cash Record Book\]…

>> (2)    \[There was a\] Payment Verification System \[based on the Monthly Invoice Spreadsheets\] in place for TSM to verify that payments were made by the \[Clients\], and monitor outstanding payments. The Payment Verification System was still in place in 2014, before \[Quah’s\] last day of work…

>> (3)    TSM admitted that he did, in fact, actively verify that payments were made by the \[Clients\], and monitor outstanding payments…

282    I did not find these submissions persuasive. I now elaborate.

##### Cash Record Book not means to verify/monitor

283    Counsel argued that “TSM’s conduct of recording his receipt of cash in \[the Cash Record Book\] show\[ed\] he had a means of verifying that payments were made…”[^448]

284    I noted that Fion recalled instances, between 2009 and 2014, where she saw Quah passing cash payments to TSM. On these occasions, she also saw TSM make a record in the Cash Record Book.[^449] In addition, it was her evidence that TSM would do the same when she passed him cash payments from SINCL’s clients.[^450] I noted that TSM candidly testified to similar effect:[^451]

> Q:    \[TSM\], \[Fion\] has given evidence that in the course of her work for \[SINCL\], she would sometimes collect cash payments from customers. Do you agree with this?

> …

> A:    Yes, sometimes she will collect cash.

> Q:    And she says when she collects cash, she will hand it over to you. Do you agree?

> A:    If it’s large amounts, I will ask her to deposit into the bank. If it’s small amounts, she will hand them over to me.

> Q:    Okay, \[Fion’s\] evidence is that once she receives cash, she hands it to you immediately?

> A:    I have already said that if it’s big amounts, I would ask her to go to the bank. If it’s small amounts, if she does not want to go, she would hand them over to me.

> Q:    And she says when she handed cash to you, you will write it in a book?

> A:    It’s a small booklet.

> Q:    And…when we asked her whether this book was kept in the 1st drawer of your office table, she said, “Yes.” Do you agree?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And then we also asked her whether she saw \[Quah\] handing cash to you when she was present in the office. And she said that \[Quah\] did.

> A:    We are very open about this. So, why wouldn’t she see it --- if it’s like a few hundred dollars, it would be handed over to me.

> Q:    And we asked her as well whether you would have also recorded the cash that you received from \[Quah\] into the book. And she said, “Yes.” Do you agree?

> A:    I have already said that if it’s big amounts, then it will go to the bank. If it’s small amounts, it would be handed over to me.

> Q:    Okay, \[TSM\], listen carefully For cash that \[Quah\] hands over to you, Fion says that you would also record it in your small book.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Okay. So, you agree that you do record it in that book?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Now, where is this book now?

> A:    I have thrown it away. Why should I keep it?

> Q:    So, when did you throw it away?

> A:    So, every month, when the accounts are settled, we would just erase and throw away.

> Q:    No, are you saying that you erased the entries away or you threw the book away?

> A:    So…every month when the accounts are settled…I would erase the entries away every month and every year, I would throw the booklet away.

> Q:    So, do you still have that booklet with you now?

> A:    No.

> Q:    So, you don’t keep any booklet at all now?

> A:    Now, I have stop\[ped\] doing this. All the money collected will be deposited into the bank.

285    That said, I bore in mind that TSM had forcefully denied the alleged Encashing Practice. He also denied that he instructed Quah to “deposit…cash cheque\[s\] into her account\[s\]…withdraw the cash and give it to \[him\]”.[^452] On this note, I reiterate my finding that the alleged “Cash Withdrawal Practice” was an afterthought on Quah’s part.[^453] In addition, the Entrusted Monies were distinct from the cash payments that TSM received from Quah.[^454] Fion’s evidence[^455] should thus be seen against this context. More fundamentally, the evidence showed that TSM’s _recording_ of the sums that Quah passed him was just that – a _recording_ exercise, so that the correct sum would be reflected on his personal cheque to the Company. It was not also an exercise “to _verify_ that payments were made by the \[Clients\], and _monitor_ outstanding payments”.[^456] This much was clear from TSM’s evidence in cross-examination:

> Q:    And so…if \[a\] customer had paid in cash, the cash would have been handed over to you?

> A:    Because I have said for small amounts, I would collect. For big amounts \[Quah\] would take them to the bank. **I do not know whether she really deposited them.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

##### Monthly Invoices Spreadsheet not reliable means to verify/monitor

286    In reply submissions, Counsel contended that there was a “Payment Verification System”, based on the Monthly Invoices Spreadsheet prepared by Fion[^457], “in place for TSM to verify that payments were made…and \[to\] monitor outstanding payments.[^458]

287    It was Fion’s evidence that she prepared the Monthly Invoices Spreadsheets using the invoices that Quah printed from ACCPAC and passed her. However, these spreadsheets did not contain any information as to whether the Company’s customers had in fact paid. They merely set out the amounts stated on the invoices. After preparing the spreadsheets, Fion would print them out and pass them to TSM. TSM would review the spreadsheets against “the figures or monthly diesel invoices” kept in a blue file. If he saw that some customers had pumped too much diesel, he would then check with Quah if these customers had already paid. If they had done so, Quah would strike the relevant entry off the spreadsheets. According to Fion, these spreadsheets were then placed on a desk in the Office. As and when customers paid, she or Quah (depending on who collected payment) would strike the relevant entry off the spreadsheets.[^459]

288    TSM did not deny the existence of these spreadsheets in cross-examination. It was his evidence that Fion prepared these spreadsheets for him “to see which customer owed how much every month.”[^460] He agreed that he therefore had a system for keeping track of which customers made payment every month through these spreadsheets.[^461] That said, he testified that he would “just look at who owe money and was the money paid.”[^462] He did this to ensure that customers did not owe the Company money for more than two or three months – for this would affect the Company’s ability to pay its diesel supplier. He also testified that he did not check the bank statements of the Company’s Account to ensure that cheques issued to the Company cleared. In this vein, I noted that TSM testified that he did not check the bank statements for the Company’s Account from 1 February 2010 to 31 December 2014[^463] on a monthly basis. It was his evidence that it was Quah who checked these statements. When asked to explain this practice (as Quah was not a director), he readily replied that “everything to do with accounts and correspondences \[Quah\] would be the one who handle it. She is the accounts.”[^464]

289    TSM’s attention was then drawn to the February 2010 bank statement, which showed a substantial deposit of $293,404.90. When asked if he was “concern\[ed\] about checking where this deposit came from”, he explained that he trusted Quah to review the Company’s bank statements as he focused on sourcing for business for the Company:[^465]

> A:    Because, usually, for these kind of correspondences, it’s not as if it’s a significantly large amount. **So, every month if the accounts or whatever that is right or wrong with regard to the accounts, I would hand it over to \[Quah\] to handle…them. I trust\[ed\] \[Quah\] to do so.**

> Q:    Mr Tan, you keep saying that you trust her, you trust her. So, what exactly is your role in the \[C\]ompany?

> A:    I would source for business outside.

> Q:    No, surely as a director, that cannot be the only role that you perform, right?

> A:    Because we are a very small company. I’m not a big company. So, as long as I can bring in business, then it would be alright.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

290    TSM was also drawn to the May 2013 bank statement, which showed a “fast cheque deposit of $655,000” into the Company’s Account. When asked if he checked this statement to ensure that this cheque cleared, his testimony revealed the degree of trust he placed in Quah:[^466]

> Q:    Mr Tan, surely you would have checked your bank statements to make sure that this cheque cleared, right?

> **A:**      **I have never checked, because I trust\[ed\] \[Quah\] to do it.**

> Q:    Mr Tan, you’re saying even for such a big amount, you didn’t care whether the cheque cleared or not?

> **A:**      **I trusted her 100%. So, everything would be handled by her.**

> **Q:**      **Now, Mr Tan, I put it to you, every month when the bank account statements are sent to the company, you would have reviewed them.**

> **A:**      **I did not.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

291    TSM also gave evidence that showed that the effectiveness of the Monthly Invoices Spreadsheets as a means to keep track of whether customers paid depended on Quah. Key aspects of his evidence are set out in **Annex D** to these grounds.[^467] It was TSM’s evidence that he “only \[took\] a look at what \[Quah\] showed \[him\].”[^468] “\[I\]f \[Quah\] cancelled \[the entry on the spreadsheets\], that means payment was made. If \[Quah\] did not cancel \[the entry\], that means payment was not made.” As such, “\[i\]f what was given \[to him was\] wrong, \[he\] would not know.[^469] I also bore in mind Fion’s evidence that TSM _still_ had to check with Quah if customers had paid – notwithstanding his receipt of these spreadsheets from her.[^470] Indeed, TSM’s reliance on (and trust in) Quah was apparent when he was questioned on the audit verification issued to EDS.[^471]

292    In these circumstances, I did not agree with Counsel that there was a “Payment Verification System”, based on the Monthly Invoices Spreadsheet, “in place for TSM to verify that payments were made…and \[to\] monitor outstanding payments. The evidence showed that TSM trusted Quah to verify if customers did in fact make payment.

### Conclusion on conviction

293    Here, Quah accepted that she had collected _all_ of the Entrusted Monies (which belonged to the Company) on the Company’s behalf. The Entrusted Monies comprised payments made in cash and by way of cash cheques – modes of payment that Quah had also specifically sought from some of the Clients.[^472]

294    Quah did not dispute that she did not bank _any_ of the Entrusted Monies into the Company’s Account. The objective evidence showed that she had instead banked a large number of cash cheques (for payments due to the Company) into accounts that she solely controlled. Two of these accounts were also lines of credit, which were neither savings nor current accounts. One of these lines of credit had further been perpetually in overdraft. To explain why she banked the Company’s cash cheques into her accounts, she claimed that TSM had instructed her to do so and she had merely complied.

295    However, key aspects of Quah’s testimony on TSM’s supposed instructions were either contradicted or unsupported by other evidence. Her case also constantly evolved (even between days of trial), whenever she was confronted with contrary evidence. Indeed, her cross-examination was marked by numerous fresh claims, allegations, and afterthoughts[^473] – all of which were concocted to explain the glaring inconsistencies in her case, and to counteract evidence that showed that she did not pass the Entrusted Monies to TSM (as she claimed she did).[^474] Indeed, when pressed to explain why she raised so many new facts under cross-examination relating to TSM’s alleged instructions, on which her case hinged, her response – “nobody asked me” – spoke volumes about the veracity of her evidence:[^475]

> Q:    So let me re-summarise the proposition for you. Are you trying to tell me that it’s not dishonest if \[TSM\] gave you permission?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    But if \[TSM\] did not give you permission, it would be dishonest, you agree?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, whether \[TSM\] gave you permission is, in fact, a very important fact for your defence.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And in spite of that, you have raised all these new facts that were not put to \[TSM\].

> **A:**      **Nobody asked me.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

296    In my judgment, Quah was a thoroughly unreliable and untruthful witness. She failed to satisfactorily account for the Entrusted Monies (which she admitted she had collected on the Company’s behalf) or offer any plausible explanation for their loss. She did not even attempt, at trial, to account for more than a third of the Entrusted Monies.[^476]

297    The evidence further showed that Quah unilaterally manipulated the Company’s accounting records (which she _solely_ prepared) on ACCPAC (that _only_ she could access) to hide her misappropriation of the Entrusted Monies.[^477] This was further evidence of her dishonesty. To ensure her misappropriation was not detected, she also did not explain the contents and significance of the audit verifications she gave to the Directors to sign (which were based on the accounting records she had solely prepared).[^478] Indeed, she was initially successful in hiding her misappropriation over the course of the offending period – for the accounting irregularities were only uncovered when a special audit was performed by the Audit Firm after she left the Company.

298    Unlike Quah, I found TSM to be a credible witness. He testified simply, without hesitation, and in a straightforward manner. The evidence showed that he had reposed a significant degree of trust in Quah, and relied entirely on her to handle the Company’s accounts in its best interests.[^479] LEC and NES might not have known much about the Company’s affairs[^480], but they too had trusted Quah significantly. After all, Quah was the Company’s best-educated employee in a very small company, whose only other employees were the Directors[^481]; most proficient in the English language[^482]; computer literate; well versed in ACCPAC; and had been in charge of the Company’s accounts (and accounting records) since she joined the Company in 2000. In contrast, the Directors were not at all proficient in the English language[^483]; computer illiterate; and did not know how to use ACCPAC.[^484] They did not even know how to turn on a computer.

299    The totality of the evidence led me “inevitably and inexorably” to conclude that Quah did dishonestly misappropriate the Entrusted Monies on her own volition (and not pursuant to any instructions from TSM). She knew that wrongful loss would result from her activities[^485], which were done with the intention of causing wrongful loss to the Company (which was wrongfully deprived of the Entrusted Monies, to which it was legally entitled). There were no other alternative inferences or conclusion reasonably possible, other than she had committed the offences. I thus convicted her on all charges.

## Decision on sentence

300    An offender who commits criminal breach of trust by a servant “shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine”. Imprisonment is thus mandatory. That said, a District Court is only empowered to pass up to 10 years’ imprisonment per charge.[^486] Subject to this limit on sentencing jurisdiction, the capping of the sentence at 10 years’ imprisonment is not a relevant sentencing consideration.[^487]

### Sentences sought by parties

301    The sentences sought by the parties in respect of _each_ charge did not differ widely. The key difference lay in the _aggregate_ sentence sought:[^488]

> (a)     the Prosecution sought “at least” 84 months’ imprisonment, _via_ an order that _three_ of the _heaviest_ sentences run consecutively.

> (b)     Counsel sought between 48 to 60 months’ imprisonment, _via_ an order that the sentences for only _two_ charges run consecutively.

302    The table on the following page sets out the sentences sought and those I eventually imposed (the shaded rows indicate those to be run consecutively).

### Reasons for sentences imposed

303    Quah was a “multiple offender” (_viz_, an offender to be sentenced for convictions on multiple offences).[^489] I therefore applied the three-stage framework in _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_[^490] (“_Raveen_”) in sentencing her.

#### Stage 1: Appropriate sentence for each charge

304    The “first stage of the sentencing analysis is…to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence. This may be done in a number of ways, including by application of a sentencing framework or benchmark, or by analogy with precedents. In arriving at the individual sentences, the sentencing court will generally have to consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon each discrete sentence”[^491].

##### General sentencing considerations

305    Retribution and general deterrence are key sentencing principles in cases of criminal breach of trust.[^492] The general sentencing considerations in such cases were also discussed in _PP v Lam Leng Hung_[^493], in the following terms:

> 367    We accept the general proposition that **in respect of property offences, including that of CBT, the starting consideration ought to be the value of the property misappropriated**. This principle has been reiterated in many cases. In _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 361</span> (“_Philip Wong_”), Chan Sek Keong J observed (at \[18\]) that **in an offence like CBT, “it \[was\] a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court”.** More recently, in the case of _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ stated in a similar vein that the “primary yardstick” involved in sentencing for an offence of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code would often be the “value of the property involved” (at \[48\]).

> 368     **While the value of the property misappropriated ought ordinarily to be the starting point for the analysis of the appropriate sentence, it also bears emphasis that the court’s discretion in sentencing is never restricted to the application of a mathematical formula based on the amount in question** (see, for example, the observations of Yong CJ in _Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kuty v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 617</span> at \[60\]). As Lee Seiu Kin J observed in _Tan Cheng Yew_ (\[96\] supra) at \[184\], **it is common sense that sentences for CBT offences do not bear a relationship of linear proportionality with the sums involved. The appropriate sentence to be imposed must be arrived at after having regard not just to the amounts in question, but also to the totality of the circumstances, particularly the specific facts of the case.**

> 369    In this connection, we find the following non-exhaustive factors set out by the English Court of Appeal in _R v John Barrick_ (1985) 81 Cr App R 78 at 81–82 relevant. While these factors were set out in the context of the offences of theft and fraud, we find them to be also relevant in the context of the offence of CBT. These factors were also cited in _Philip Wong_ at \[25\]. They include (**a) the quality and degree of trust reposed in the offender, which would encompass a consideration of his rank; (b) the period over which the act was perpetrated;** (c) the use to which the money or property that was dishonestly taken was put; (d) the effect upon the victim; and (e) the impact of the offences on the public and public confidence.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

306    With these considerations in mind, I now review the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case. Two reported sentencing precedents are then examined. I conclude this section with my reasons for the individual sentences imposed.

##### Aggravating factors

307    The facts disclosed the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     Quah breached the very significant degree of trust reposed in her.

> (b)     Quah manipulated the accounting records to avoid detection.

> (c)     Quah’s offending was premediated and planned.

308    I now discuss these factors. The second and third factors, in particular, overlapped considerably as they shared a common normative substance. To avoid double counting and putting excessive weight on them, I considered them holistically and applied only a _single_ uplift in sentence.

Breach of significant degree of trust

309    I did not treat the fact that Quah was employed as a servant of the Company as aggravating, because this was an ingredient of the offence.[^494] In addition, Quah might have abused the trust reposed in her by the Company when she dishonestly misappropriated the Entrusted Monies. But, I did not treat the abuse of trust, in itself, as aggravating – since an abuse of trust is a factor inherent in every offence of criminal breach of trust.[^495]_Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam v PP_[^496] (“_Kavitha_”) is useful on both points. The offender there was a customer service officer. In this role, she was tasked by her employer (“JPB”) to collect payments from customers and to record them in JPB’s internal accounting system. Over the course of five months, she misappropriated cash payments that she received from different customers by recording:

> (a)     in JPB’s internal accounting system a lower amount paid by the customers, and misappropriating the difference; and

> (b)     other payments made _via_ cheque or NETS under the name of cash-paying customers, and misappropriating the entire payment.

310    In sentencing, the District Court regarded the offender’s offence as aggravated as she “was placed in a high position of trust” as a customer service officer”. The High Court disagreed, reasoning as follows:

> 18    …**It is true that the quality and degree of trust reposed in the offender, including his position in the relevant establishment, is a factor to be taken into account when determining the sentence for an offence under s 408 of the Penal Code** (_Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 361</span> at \[25\]). **In the present case, however, the \[offender\] was a customer service officer and there was no evidence to suggest that she was entrusted with any special level of responsibility in JPB or was in any elevated position of trust. Although her job scope as a customer service officer included having to collect payments made by customers and record them in JPB’s internal accounting system, this was a role which would be given to any sales personnel within a company**. In addition, the fact that the appellant had abused this responsibility was already reflected in the charge itself which was for committing criminal breach of trust _as a clerk or servant_ – a more serious offence than a criminal breach of trust _simpliciter_ (see _Lim Ying Ying Luciana v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span> (“_Luciana Lim_”) at \[67\]). Hence, the appellant’s abuse of the trust reposed in her should not have been considered by the DJ as a separate aggravating factor.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

311    In this case, the Prosecution argued that the sentences imposed should reflect the fact that Quah had “breached the very significant degree of trust reposed in her”:

> 9    \[Quah\] was a manager of \[the Company\] for more than 14 years, between 2 May 2000 and 25 August 2014. **She oversaw \[the Company’s\] accounts**…**and controlled its data entry**. \[Quah\] was in fact more highly educated than \[the Company’s Directors\]; she has A-Level qualifications, is able to read, write and speak English fluently, and was proficient in \[the Company’s\] accounting software \[_ie_, ACCPAC\].

> 10    Against this backdrop, **\[Quah\] was deeply trusted by TSM to appropriately manage \[the Company’s\] accounts**. Her position gave her dominion and control over a significant portion of \[the Company’s\] funds. **In fact, she was so trusted that TSM effectively ceased overseeing her work after several years** \[as shown by the evidence of TSM\]:

>> Q:    So, can you just confirm that \[Quah\] did in fact report to you?

>> A:    Initially for a few years.

>> Q:    And do you oversee her work?

>> A:    Initially I did for quite some years, but later because I have heart problem and I underwent surgery. I thought that she was quite good after working for me for a few years. So after 7 to 8 years and because of my heart problems, I just let her do her work.

>> \---

>> Q:    I’ll move on. Who else, if anyone, worked with \[Quah\] on \[the Company’s\] accounts between 2009 and 2014?

>> A:    No, she take over everything and she was in charge of everything.

>> Q:    Did anyone report to \[Quah\]?

>> A:    I don’t think so, it’s just that Fion would assist her.

>> …

>> Q:    So, coming back to my question Mr Tan, do you know the information ACCPAC records?

>> A:    I do not know, I only know that all the accounts could be inside.

>> Q:    So, do you double check \[Quah’s\] entries on ACCPAC?

>> A:    I do not know how to. How could I check?

>> Q:    Do you know how to use a computer?

>> A:    No.

> 11     **\[Quah\] was the sole person \[in the Company\] with full oversight of \[the Company’s\] accounts** \[who\] exploited the high degree of trust reposed in her to \[its\] significant detriment…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

312    I agreed that the sentences imposed should reflect the quality and degree of trust reposed in Quah, including her position in the Company.[^497] In this vein, I bore in mind that “in determining the level of trust reposed in a person, the court looks to substance and not to form; thus a person with a humble title may occupy a high position of trust”.[^498]

313    The evidence showed that Quah was the _only_ employee in a very small company (whose only other employees were the Directors) who performed _all_ of the following duties (with _negligible_ oversight):

> (a)     liaising with the Company’s customers on payment;

> (b)     collecting payments from the Company’s customers (including _cash_ payments) on the Company’s behalf;

> (c)     preparing the Company’ accounting records on ACCPAC, to which only she had access (as the Prosecution noted, Quah “controlled the \[Company’s\] data entry” on ACCPAC[^499]); and

> (d)     liaising with the Audit Firm on its general audits of the Company and the Company’s accounting records (including allaying any concerns the Audit Firm might have had with these records after its audits).

314    The degree of trust the Directors (the three remaining employees in the Company) reposed in Quah was also significant. This stemmed from her being the _only_ employee in the Company who:

> (a)     was proficient in the English language (the language used in ACCPAC and all the accounting documents);

> (b)     was computer literate;

> (c)     knew how to use ACCPAC; and

> (d)     dealt with the Company’s accounts

315    Indeed, the degree of trust the Directors had in Quah was so great that they blindly signed the audit verifications she handed them (which contained false information). LEC’s and NEC’s limited concern about the Company’s affairs was also significant – for they were the only two other persons in the Company (apart from TSM) who could have monitored Quah’s work (but clearly did not). TSM, in particular, reposed a significant degree of trust in Quah. Among other things, he trusted Quah to:

> (a)     monitor if customers had already paid the Company;[^500]

> (b)     write the sums on his personal cheques, for him to return to the Company the cash payments he had received from Quah[^501]; and

> (c)     review the Company’s bank account statements and the sums deposited into the Company’s Account[^502].

316    Hence, notwithstanding Quah’s nondescript title of “Manager”, she plainly occupied an elevated position of trust in the Company.

Accounting records manipulated to avoid detection

317    “A sophisticated offence replete with carefully orchestrated efforts and steps to avoid detection is an aggravating factor”.[^503] That said, “a criminal scheme may be said to be “sophisticated” and “carefully orchestrated” even if it did not involve the use of complicated technology and was carried out by a single operator working alone, rather than a syndicate. In all cases, what is critical is not the intricacy of the criminal enterprise _per se_, but whether there were careful steps taken to avoid detection”.[^504]

318    Here, Quah had manipulated the accounting records to hide her misappropriation of the Entrusted Monies”.[^505] Her failure to explain the audit verifications she gave to the Directors to sign was also no accident. It was part of her efforts to avoid detection. These verifications were based on the accounting records she solely prepared and manipulated. Had she properly explained them to the Directors, her manipulation of these records would have been uncovered. That said, I was mindful not to give excessive weight to this factor. This was because the evidence did not show that the offences were _replete_ with carefully orchestrated efforts to avoid detection.

Premeditated & planned offending

319    General deterrence aside[^506], specific deterrence is appropriate where an offence is premediated. Specific deterrence was applicable here because Quah’s offences were premeditated _and_ planned. Here, the offences were not committed impulsively because of a momentary lapse of judgment. They were all premediated and planned. The presence of planning and premeditation evinces a considered commitment towards law breaking, and reflects greater criminality and culpability.[^507] That said, I was mindful:

> (a)     that “deterrence must always be tempered by proportionality in relation to the severity of the offences committed as well as by the moral and legal culpability of the offender.”[^508]

> (b)     not to attach excessive weight to this factor, because:

>> (i)       it is inherent in the offence of criminal breach of trust that there would have been _some_ premeditation and planning. This is not usually an offence that happens spontaneously. It is the _degree_ of premeditation and planning that is more relevant in sentencing.

>> (ii)       the premeditation and planning in this case was evident largely from the active steps Quah took to avoid detection.[^509]

##### Mitigating factors of limited weight

320    Counsel urged the court to accept the following “mitigating factors”:[^510]

> (a)     Quah had “no prior antecedents”.

> (b)     Quah was “cooperative with the police during their investigations…evident from the fact that she provided 12 statements to the police. These included 7 \[investigation\] statements, which she provided over the period from 21 April 2015 to 2 January 2018, _ie_, a period of almost 3 years”.

> (c)     Quah “acted reasonably in her Defence, with a view to narrow the disputed issues \[as\] reflected in her readiness to agree on an Agreed Statement of Facts and a Bundle of Agreed Documents”.

321    I did not find these factors particularly compelling. I now elaborate.

Quah was not a first-time offender

322    I was aware that Quah had no antecedents[^511], but gave limited weight to this factor. This was in light of the five charges against her, which encompassed 168 distinct instances of misappropriation over nearly five years.[^512] She was thus not entitled to be treated as a first-time offender – a principle recognised in _Chen Weixiong Jerriek v PP_:[^513]

> 15     **The appellant could not be regarded as a “first offender” in any sense of the phrase. While he had no antecedents in the sense of prior convictions, he had pleaded guilty to seven charges** of robbery with common intention, robbery with hurt with common intention and voluntarily causing hurt by means of a dangerous weapon. **Further, no less than 38 other charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing** – these comprised 32 charges for offences of robbery with common intention and six charges for offences of robbery with hurt with common intention. **The only reason the appellant had no prior convictions was because the law had not yet caught up with him for his past misdeeds.**

> …

> 17    …it is the prerogative of this court **to refuse to consider as a first time offender anyone who has been charged with multiple offences, even if he has no prior convictions. I would venture further to hold that in any case, the courts in general should be extremely reluctant to regard such persons as first time offenders.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

323    Evidence of good character (in that Quah had no criminal antecedents) was also of little mitigating weight in this case, which involved an abuse of trust. This was because Quah must have been placed in a position of trust by virtue of her previous good character. But, she subsequently abused this trust.[^514]

Quah’s “cooperation” with authorities not mitigating

324    The mere fact that Quah provided 12 statements to the police[^515] was not, in itself, a mitigating factor, for which she deserved credit.

325    I deal first with the seven investigation statements recorded from Quah. This was done pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“the CPC”).[^516] Section 22(1) empowers a police officer conducting an investigation under Part IV of the CPC to record a statement from “any person who appears to be acquainted with any of the facts and circumstances of \[a\] case”. Under s 22(2) of the CPC, the “person examined shall be bound to state truly what \[she\] knows of the facts and circumstances of the case, except that \[she\] need not say anything that might expose \[her\] to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture”. Quah was hence “bound to state truly what \[she knew\] of the facts and circumstances of the case” save for “anything that \[would have exposed her\] to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture”. As such, Quah’s “mere presence and compliance with \[the\] statement-recording procedures \[in the CPC cannot, in itself, be said to be\] indicative of \[any\] cooperativeness”[^517] on her part. Indeed, had she intentionally omitted to furnish information or refused to answer any question demanded of her (save for “anything that \[would have exposed her\] to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture”), she could have been prosecuted under ss 176 or 179 of the Penal Code.[^518]

326    In any event, Quah was in fact _not_ cooperative – for she had maintained her claim in her statements that she handed the Entrusted Monies to TSM.[^519]

327    Quah’s cautioned statements also bear mention. These were recorded from her _after_ her investigation statements. There, she _denied_ all of the charges and reiterated that she had been acting on TSM’s instructions.[^520]

328    I did not discern any remorse from Quah in any of her statements, for which she deserved any credit. That said, I did not attach any weight to the fact that Quah claimed trial. She was entitled to exercise her constitutional right to plead not guilty and to claim trial.[^521] However, as her counsel acknowledged, “an accused person who pleads guilty would typically be entitled to some sentencing discount…to take into account the accused’s plea of guilt as a mitigating factor reflecting \[her\] remorse”.[^522] Given that Quah had not pleaded guilty, she was thus not entitled to any sentencing discount.[^523]

Quah’s conduct of defence not particularly mitigating

329    Quah did “agree on an Agreed Statement of Facts and a Bundle of Agreed Documents”. These certainly “narrow\[ed\] the disputed issues”.[^524] That said, I did not attach significant weight to this factor. This was because the “Bundle of Agreed Documents” comprised documents which:

> (a)     the Prosecution would not have had much difficulty in proving:

>> (i)       bank statements (**AB1** to **AB7**);

>> (ii)       documents prepared by Quah using ACCPAC and extracted from ACCPAC: the Clients’ Transactions Records (**AB8** to **AB13**), the Company’s general ledgers (**AB38** and **AB39**), and invoices issued to the Clients (**AB32** to **AB37**); and

>> (iii)       cash cheques issued by the Clients, with Quah’s name and bank account numbers on the back (**AB14** to **AB18**).

> (b)     were consistent with Quah’s case (and so were actually adduced in support of her case):

>> (i)       investigation statements (**AB20** to **AB26**); and

>> (ii)       cautioned statements (**AB27** to **AB31**).

> (c)     were neutral, such as Quah’s resignation letter (**AB19**).

330    The “Agreed Statement of Facts” related largely to the documents in the “Agreed Bundle of Documents”. I noted that Quah did additionally agree that she had collected _part_ of the Entrusted Monies from the Clients during the offending period.[^525]. That said, she had already reflected these sums as having been received in the Clients’ Customer Transactions Records. The bulk of this part of the Entrusted Monies also related to payments for which the Prosecution had obtained images of the relevant cheques (on which Quah had written her name and account numbers). In addition, she was “not prepared to accept that she had received all of the \[Entrusted Monies\] (as \[was\] her right) and only eventually conceded this under cross-examination”.[^526]

No restitution/recovery of Entrusted Monies

331    There was neither restitution nor recovery of any of the Entrusted Monies. There was hence no basis for any attenuation in sentencing, on account of remorse on Quah’s part or a reduction in the harm caused by her offences.

##### Reported sentencing precedents

332    As indicated[^527], the sentences sought by the parties in respect of _each_ charge did not differ widely. The individual sentences sought by the Prosecution ranged from 20 to 30 months’ imprisonment, while those sought by Counsel ranged from 24 to 30 months’ imprisonment. The key difference between the parties lay in the number of sentences that should be run consecutively (and, hence the total sentence). Against this backdrop, I discuss two reported sentencing precedents that I found especially useful in calibrating the individual sentences. Three points, however, bear mention at the outset. First, I did not find Counsel’s reliance on _PP v Bahurudeen Kuthpudeen_ (“_Bahurudeen_”)[^528] useful. Counsel’s submissions were in the following terms:

> 14.    In \[_Bahurudeen_\], the accused pleaded guilty to 1 charge under s 408 of the Penal Code and 1 charge under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“CDSA”). **The s 408 charge involved a sum of S$469,900/-, and it was misappropriated on one occasion. The accused did not make any restitution.** At \[14\] of _Bahurudeen_, the learned District Judge referred to a summary of s 408 precedents. **The court considered that the accused’s plea of guilt had little mitigating value (because he actually fled to overseas before being arrested and detained). Eventually a sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment was imposed on the accused for the s 408 charge.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

333    It was not entirely clear if Counsel was relying on _Bahurudeen_ in support of his position on the individual sentences or the aggregate sentence. This was because the sum stated in the single proceeded s 408 Penal Code charge in _Bahurudeen_ was $469,900 – _far_ greater than the sums stated in any of the individual charges against Quah.[^529] “Generally, the larger the amount misappropriated, the more severe the punishment that should be meted out”.[^530] The converse must also be true. _Bahurudeen_ was hence not useful in calibrating the individual sentences in this case. In any event, while Counsel was correct that the offender in _Bahurudeen_ did not make any restitution, he failed to note the fact that the _bulk_ of the misappropriated sum – amounting to more than $458,600 – was recovered. This was clear from the following paragraphs in the statement of facts tendered in _Bahurudeen_:

> 12.    The accused was eventually detained at the border of Kedah, when attempting to leave Malaysia for Thailand. **Cash amounting to S$23,652/-, Malaysia Ringgit 701/- and Brunei $1/- was found in his possession and seized. The moneys seized from the accused are part of the sum he misappropriated.**

> 13.    According to the accused, he had met a friend of his in Malaysia and handed him approximately S$430,000 of the money he had misappropriated. The accused also claimed that he had informed his friend that the money belonged to the accused and a few friends, and that he would contact him in two days’ time to collect the money. Eventually, the accused’s friend came to know about the accused’s arrest. The accused’s friend’s brother then made arrangements to meet with the complainant to return him the money. T**he complainant met the accused’s friend’s brother together with other individuals in Malaysia and was returned a sum of S$435,000**, of which he gave $3,400 as a reward to them for their assistance and honesty.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

334    The recovery of this sum did not amount to voluntary restitution. It was also “solely due to the efforts of third parties, namely the authorities involved in \[the offender’s\] detention at the Kedah border, and the \[offender’s\] friend’s brother and others who had returned the money to the \[victim\]”.[^531] That said, the fact that “a significant amount of money was finally recovered” was _still_ given _some_ weight (though not as a mitigating factor in the offender’s favour). This was because the recovery of such a significant sum (amounting to more than 97% of the sum stated in the charge) had the effect of significantly reducing the measure of loss to the victim (or the harm caused by the offence).[^532] It would have been wrong, in principle, to punish the offender in _Bahurudeen_ as if the measure of loss to the victim (and the harm caused) was in fact $469,900. After all, the severity of an offence must be assessed by having regard to the principal parameters of harm caused and the offender’s culpability.[^533]

335    In addition, Counsel was not entirely correct that the offender’s plea of guilt had “little mitigating value”.[^534]_Some_ weight was given to the offender’s guilty plea, as is evident from the following paragraph in _Bahurudeen_:

> 38    Further, while the accused did ultimately plead guilty, I noted that in light of his detention at the Kedah border with part of the tainted sum, the fact that he had fled Singapore soon after the commission of the misappropriation offence, and was also attempting to flee further to Thailand, as well as the fact that his offences had already been uncovered by the time he was detained, meant that there was clearly overwhelming evidence to support his conviction. In this regard, his plea of guilt may have little or no mitigating value. This is consistent with the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Fu Foo Tong and others v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 1</span>, where the Court made clear at \[12\] that “A plea of guilt can be of no mitigating value, for example, when the evidence overwhelmingly supports a conviction.” **That said, I recognised and accepted that his plea of guilt had at least saved time and public resources that might otherwise have been expended if there was a trial, and it also dispensed with the need for witnesses to testify (see** **_Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_** **<span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span>). To that extent, I did give some weight to his guilty plea.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

336     Second, I was mindful that while the punishments imposed for offences involving criminal breach of trust ought to increase in severity with the amounts misappropriated, the sentences do not bear a relationship of liner proportionality with the sums involved. This point was expressly recognised by the High Court in _Lim Ying Ying Luciana v PP_[^535] (“_Luciana Lim_”), in the following terms:[^536]

> **_Sentencing precedents_**

> 68    As far as the precedents were concerned, the Prosecution cautioned against reliance on the older cases and submitted that there had been a “clear upward trend in the sentences for such offences in recent years”. They drew my attention to the following three decisions of the District Court – _PP v Lee Han Boon Adrian_ DAC 911016/2014, _PP v Koh Mui Hoong_ DAC 500714/2013, _PP v Yeo Kay Keng Matthew_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 425</span> (“_Matthew Yeo_”) – all of which involved the misappropriation of between $1m and $2m and in respect of which sentences of between five and six years’ imprisonment were imposed. Extrapolating from this, they submitted that the starting point of nine years’ imprisonment arrived at by the District Judge was too low and that a starting point of between ten and 12 years’ imprisonment ought to have been ordered instead. With respect, I could not agree with this.

> 69     **There is no question that the amount of money misappropriated is an important sentencing consideration. Generally, the larger the amount misappropriated, the more severe the punishment that should be meted out. However, it has been emphasised in past cases that while the punishments imposed for CBT offences ought to increase in severity with the amounts misappropriated, the sentences “do not bear a relationship of linear proportionality with the sums involved” (see** **_PP v Tan Cheng Yew_** **<span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 1095</span> (“Tan Cheng Yew”) at \[184\]). The fact that proportionately higher punishments were imposed for offences involving smaller sums of money does not, without more, imply that the District Judge had selected an inappropriate starting point or that the eventual sentence she arrived at was manifestly inadequate.** I also did not think it possible to derive a sentencing range from such a small sample size (particularly considering the circumspection with which unreported decisions are generally viewed: see _Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 707</span> at \[21\]).

> \[emphasis in bold italics in original; emphasis added in bold\]

337     Third, in calibrating the individual sentences in this case, I also relied on decisions where the relevant charges had been framed under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code (“the 1985 Penal Code”).[^537] Under this earlier edition of the Penal Code, the offence of criminal breach of trust by a servant was punishable with mandatory imprisonment of up to 7 years (only). This was _less than half_ the maximum of 15 years’ imprisonment that Quah was liable for in respect of each of the five charges she faced under the current edition of the Penal Code. I set out this difference in the table below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.8%"> <col width="46.84%"> <col width="23.36%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence committed</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Maximum term prescribed</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Remarks</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Before 1 February 2008</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 years’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1985 Penal Code</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">After 1 February 2008</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 years’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Quah’s charges</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

338    That said, the amendments to the Penal Code that came into effect in 2008 did not mean that sentencing precedents for offences under s 408 of the 1985 Penal Code are irrelevant. They continue to serve as a good guide. These amendments – which more than doubled the maximum imprisonment term for criminal breach of trust as a servant – also did not mean that Parliament intended for the imprisonment terms for criminal breach of trust as a servant to “automatically” go up regardless of the facts of the case. These two points were evident during the second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill:[^538]

> …we must leave it to the courts to mete out punishment. … **This is the point that I want to address when Mr Lim Biow Chuan asks whether what we have done will lead automatically to fines or punishments going up. I do not think so.** He has mentioned, for example, the benchmarks, the sentencing guidelines, that the courts have. **I think the guidelines will continue. It does not mean that automatically when the maximum punishment is raised, the punishment will go up.** Because every punishment must depend on the facts of the case. And I think the new Chief Justice has mentioned that the punishment should fit the crime as well as the offender…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

339    However, I was also mindful of the need for consistency with legislative intent given the increase in the punishment for the offences that Quah had committed. This was recognised in _Lam Leng Hung_ in the following terms:

> 386    The increase in the maximum imprisonment term for the offence of CBT in the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code was the result of a comprehensive review of the penalty regime across a number of offences under the Penal Code carried out by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Attorney-General’s Chambers, the Ministry of Law and other government agencies. During the second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2007 (No 38 of 2007), the Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs identified four principles by which the review of the penalties for the various offences was undertaken. These principles were as follows: (a) the type and quantum of punishment should provide sufficient flexibility to the courts to mete out an appropriate sentence in each case; (b) the prevalence of the offence; (c) the proportionality of the penalty to an offence, taking into account the seriousness of the offence; and (d) the relativity in punishment between related offences (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (22 October 2007) vol 83 col 2201 (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee)).

> 387    It is **clear from the tenor of the Parliamentary Debates on the amendments that where Parliament increased the maximum sentence imposable for a particular offence, this signified that Parliament viewed the offence as more serious and therefore requiring stiffer punishments in line with current societal trends and circumstances** (see also Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (23 October 2007) vol 83 cols 2425–2444 (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee)). This is also consistent with the observations in _Mehra Radhika v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 96</span> where Menon CJ said as follows (at \[27\]):

>> … As a generally operative background factor, if Parliament has increased the punishment for an offence on the basis that the mischief in question was becoming more serious and needed to be arrested … the courts would not be acting in concert with the legislative intent if they fail to have regard to this in developing the appropriate sentencing framework or if they nonetheless err on the side of leniency in sentencing.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

340    I now discuss the two sentencing precedents I found especially useful.

Tan Kiang Chua Destry

341    The offender in _PP v Tan Kiang Chua Destry_ (“_Destry Tan_”)[^539] was an International Marketing Vice President of a company that operated casinos. His duties included carrying out sales, marketing, organising events, and collecting debts owed to the company by its clients. Between August 2005 and June 2006 (_viz_., a period almost 11 months), he misappropriated a total of $214,139.20.

342    The offender had an agreement with a client of the company, in which the client was to repay a debt owed to the company in instalments. The client paid these instalments to the company through the offender – who was to then remit the sums received into the company’s account. However, the offender only remitted part of the monies he received and kept the remainder (totalling $214,139.20) for himself.

343    The offender’s misappropriation came to light when the client was refused a cheque cashing facility in a casino because he had outstanding debts with the company. The client then informed the company that he had already repaid his debt (through the offender) and thus should not have been recorded as still owing it money. The company conducted an investigation into these claims, and discovered that the sums the client claimed to have paid to the company (through the offender) did not tally with its accounts. The offender then confessed his misdeeds to the company. He had used the misappropriated monies to pay off his gambling debts and for personal expenses. He made _full_ restitution to the company.

344    The offender had no prior antecedents. He pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 408 of the 1985 Penal Code. A second charge, also under s 408 of the 1985 Penal Code but involving a much lower sum of $20,225.39, was considered in sentencing (or “TIC”). He was sentenced as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="30.54%"> <col width="53.8%"> <col width="15.66%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sum misappropriated</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Imprisonment</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Remarks</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$214,139.20</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24 months’</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">-</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$20,225.39</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">-</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TIC</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$234,364.59 (total)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>24 months’ imprisonment (total sentence)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>-</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

345    In sentencing the offender, the District Court took into account the following:

> (a)     The offender’s use of the client’s instalments was “not on the spur of the moment \[but\] done with premeditation.[^540]

> (b)     Given the offender’s “senior position” as the International Marketing Vice President in the company, he was in a “high position” of trust.[^541]

> (c)     The total sum misappropriated (_viz_., $234,264.59) was substantial, and the sentence imposed should reflect this.[^542]

> (d)     The offender had “caused the \[client\] embarrassment” when the company refused to allow him the use a cheque cashing facility because he apparently had outstanding debts with the company.[^543]

> (e)     The offence committed “would undermine the confidence of the casino’s customers.[^544]

> (f)     The offender had used the misappropriated monies “to settle his gambling debts at the expense of his clients’ and employers’ interest”.[^545]

346    The District Court noted that it would have imposed a sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment but for the full restitution made. Given the offender’s full restitution, the court gave a “one third reduction” and imposed a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment instead.[^546]The High Court dismissed the offender’s appeal against sentence.[^547]

Xie Ming Liang

347    The offender in _PP v Xie Ming Liang_[^548] was a Marketing and Operations Manager in a company. His duties included collecting payments from clients, which he had to hand over to the company. He continued to be entrusted with this task after he was promoted to Deputy General Manager in 2008. He faced seven charges, for misappropriating a total of $984,360.60 between 1 March 2004 and 24 December 2009. He spent all of the monies misappropriated on his gambling and other personal debts. He made restitution of $7,000.

348    The offender’s misdeeds were in fact discovered sometime in 2007 by the Managing Director of the company, who gave him a chance and even treated some of the monies taken as a “loan” from the company that the offender was to repay. However, the offender continued misappropriating monies from the Company. The company finally made a police report in December 2010.

349    The offender pleaded guilty to three charges. The remaining four charges were considered in sentencing. The charges were punishable under either the 1985 Penal Code or the Penal Code. The key details of all seven charges are set out in the table below:

![]([2020] SGDC 0066_Image/[2020] SGDC 0066_image3.png)

350    In sentencing the offender, the District Judge reasoned as follows:

> 9     **The Accused pleaded guilty and had only one previous conviction for a minor, dissimilar offence. However, where an offender faces multiple charges, even if he has no previous convictions, the Court should be extremely reluctant to regard him as a first offender**…**Given that it would have been clear from the clients’ evidence that he had collected the money, and he had already admitted to \[the Managing Director\] that he had pocketed the money, the case against him was strong. His guilty plea was thus of limited weight**. It is also clear that in a case of criminal breach of trust, **the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated, the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence** of the Court…

> …

> 11    In _Francis Yeo Eng Wah v PP_ (MA 179/97)[^549], the offender, a sales executive, pleaded guilty to one charge under section 408 of the Penal Code, for misappropriating $116,671.40 over the course of a year. The money had been collected by him from customers. No restitution was made. He was a first offender and was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.

> 12    In _Moo Meng Kwong v PP_ (MA 130/98, unreported), the offender, the chief cashier of a bank, pleaded guilty to misappropriating S$514,000 and US$35,000. Some of this money was derived from him selling travellers’ cheques which he received in the course of his work and pocketing the proceeds, while others were taken from the bank vault to which he had access. \[All the monies misappropriated were used to settle his debts, most of which arose from investments in shares\]. **He made full restitution and was a first offender**. He was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.[^550] This was affirmed on appeal.

> …

> 15    In considering the appropriate sentence to impose on the Accused, I noted that his **offences spanned a period of nearly six years.** He was **found out by his employers and given a chance, but did not seize that opportunity to make things right. Instead, in a total lack of contrition, he took advantage of \[the Managing Director’s\] generosity and carried on committing further offences.** His was a **prolonged course of criminal conduct which could not be attributed to a one-off moment of folly or lapse of judgment**. The **restitution made was hardly an appreciable amount (less than 1%) in comparison to what was taken**. Worst was the fact that his **debts were incurred due to gambling, instead of a more worthy cause such as, eg, helping a family member to finance medical treatment**. I thus found **few mitigating factors in his favour.** The **fact that he made no attempt to conceal his conduct was neutral at best, and could not be regarded as a mitigating factor, since it also demonstrated his brazenness.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

351    The offender was then sentenced as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0066_Image/[2020] SGDC 0066_image4.png)

352    The High Court dismissed the offender’s appeal against sentence.[^551]

##### Appropriate sentence for each charge

354    In calibrating the sentence for the charge involving $127,104.40 (the lowest quantum), I considered _Xie Ming Liang_. This was because two of the proceeded charges there involved comparable sums ($118,751.20 and $138,000). They were also punishable under s 408 of the Penal Code.[^552] In addition, the offences there were premeditated and the offender was not considered a first-time offender since he had multiple charges.

355    That said:

> (a)     while the offender in _Xie Ming Liang_ had displayed a “total lack of contrition” when he “took advantage of \[the Managing Director’s\] generosity \[in giving him a second chance\] and carried on committing further offences, he _did_ plead guilty. Coupled with his restitution (albeit of a “hardly…appreciable amount”), this demonstrated at least _some_ remorse on his part. His guilty plea also dispensed with the need for witnesses to testify and saved judicial resources.[^553] Here, Quah was convicted only after a 10-day trial, in which she showed no remorse.

> (b)     the quality and degree of trust the Company/Directors reposed in Quah was _greater_ than that reposed in the offender in _Xie Ming Liang_.

> (c)     the offender in _Xie Ming Liang_ did not take any steps to conceal his misappropriation of the company’s monies, unlike Quah.

356    However, the four similar charges considered in sentencing in _Xie Ming Liang_ would have increased the sentences imposed in respect of the three proceeded charges.[^554] A term of two years’ imprisonment was _also_ imposed for the charge involving $138,000 – this was about $11,000 more than the sum of $127,104.40 in Quah’s charge.

357    All things considered, I thought that an appropriate sentence for the charge involving $127,104.40 was about **27 months’ imprisonment**.

358    The charges involving $169,974.60 and $174,166.12 merited higher sentences. These sums exceeded $127,104.40 by more than $40,000. An appropriate sentence for these charges was about **29 months’ imprisonment**.

359    The remaining two charges involved sums of $221,172.91 and $227,403.66. In calibrating the sentences for these charges, I considered _Destry Tan_. There, 24 months’ imprisonment was imposed for a charge involving a _smaller_ sum of $214,139.20. Like the instant case, the offences were premeditated and the offender was in an elevated position of trust. How Quah used the misappropriated monies was, however, unclear. The Clients’ operations also appeared unaffected by Quah’s offences. That said, the offender in _Destry Tan_ had pleaded guilty and made _full_ restitution. There was also no evidence that he took steps to conceal his misappropriation of the company’s monies. Indeed, he confessed his misdeeds when confronted. The single charge considered in sentencing would have increased the sentence for the proceeded charge (albeit, minimally, as it amounted to only about 10% of the sum involved for the proceeded charge). All things considered, I thought that an appropriate sentence for these charges was about **32 months’ imprisonment**.

360    The table below lists the individual sentences I thought appropriate:

#### Stage 2: Determining how individual sentences should run

361    The second stage of the analysis is to determine how the individual sentences should run. As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively.[^555] Here, at least two sentences had to run consecutively given s 307(1) of the CPC. In this regard, Counsel argued that _only_ two sentences should be run consecutively because of the one-transaction rule:

> 22.    In \[_Raveen_\], the Honourable High Court held that the premise of the one-transaction principle is that “_if there is a single invasion of a legally protected interest, then even if this might give rise to several offences, it is, in the final analysis, the violation of that single interest that is being punished and concurrent sentences would thus ordinarily suffice to reflect the seriousness of the offences_.”

> …

> 24.    We submit that all 5 offences pertain to the same “_single invasion of a legally protected interest_”. The latter is reflected in the fact that the victim is the same in all 5 charges, and the nature of the offence is also the same in all 5 charges. As such, the one-transaction principle should apply.

> \[emphasis added in original\]

362    This submission was a misapplication of the one-transaction rule. Where two or more offences are committed in the course of a _single_ transaction, this rule requires that all sentences in respect of those offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive.[^556] It is an evaluative rule directed towards whether an offender should be doubly punished for offences that have been committed simultaneously or close together in time.[^557] In the final analysis, however, its application is an exercise in common sense.[^558]

363    This was not a case where the offences underlying the charges were committed in the course of a _single_ transaction. The “victim” might have been the Company throughout. The nature of the offences might have been the same as well. But, the charges reflected offending over _different_ periods (and not simultaneously). Indeed, each charge encompassed several _distinct_ instances of misappropriation. This was not a case where the offences involved a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest”. Rather, they involved _multiple_ invasions of the same legally protected interest. In these circumstances, it would have been an affront to common sense to suggest that the one-transaction rule applied to limit the number of sentences that should be run consecutively. The net effect of Counsel’s submission was that an offender could _repeatedly_ commit the same type of offence against the same victim on _different_ occasions and still expect a sentencing discount – _regardless_ of how prolonged the offending conduct. This was tantamount to an inducement to criminal conduct.

364    The question of whether Quah’s offences were related or otherwise “should be addressed with due sensitivity to the facts and a healthy dose of common sense”.[^559] The offences underlying her charges were plainly separate and unrelated (in that they were not part of a single transaction). The general rule that sentences for such offences should run consecutively thus applied. The application of this general rule in this case would have yielded 149 months’ imprisonment (or 12 years’ and 5 months’ imprisonment).[^560]

#### Stage 3: Application of totality principle

365    The third stage of the sentencing analysis is to apply the totality principle, and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality.[^561] There are two limbs to this principle, characterised by the following questions:

> (a)     whether the total sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences; and

> (b)     whether the effect of the total sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with her past record and future prospects.

366    A court should bear in mind the following rationales for the principle:[^562]

> (a)     “an aggregation resulting in a longer sentence is going to carry a compounding effect that bears more than a liner relation to the cumulative and overall criminality of the case”.

> (b)     “an extremely long aggregate sentence may induce a feeling of hopelessness that destroys all prospects of the offender’s subsequent rehabilitation and reintegration”.

367    The totality principle should ordinarily apply with greater force in cases involving longer aggregate sentences – for instance, where the offender is sentenced for numerous offences in a single sitting or where the individual sentences are themselves relatively lengthy. The longer the aggregated sentence, the greater the risk of a disproportionate sentence. If an aggregate sentence is considered excessive, a court may opt for a different combination of sentences to run consecutively or adjust the individual sentences.[^563]

368    In this regard, Counsel relied on three cases to argue that only two sentences should be run consecutively – to “result in an aggregate imprisonment term of between 48 to 60 months, _ie_, 4 to 5 years”:[^564]

> (a)      _PP v Yeo Kay Keng Matthew_ (“_Matthew Yeo_”)[^565];

> (b)      _Luciana Lim_; and

> (c)      _PP v Christopher Foong Yew Eong_ (“_Christopher Foong_”).[^566]

369    I did not find Counsel’s submissions persuasive. I now elaborate.

#### Matthew Yeo

370    The offender (who had no antecedents) faced 32 charges.[^567] These included three under s 408 of the Penal Code. He pleaded guilty to nine charges. Two of these nine charges (and the most serious of the proceeded charges) were under s 408 of the Penal Code.[^568] The remaining seven charges were for converting, or removing from Singapore, property representing the offender’s benefits of criminal conduct (obtained from the commission of the offences under s 408 of the Penal Code).

371    I set out the key details of all the three charges under s 408 of the Penal Code:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="37.24%"> <col width="48.94%"> <col width="13.82%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offending period</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Property dishonestly converted</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Remarks</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">April 2008 to March 2009 (period of about 11 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">58 mobile phones, which the offender sold for about $18,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TIC</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">April 2009 to March 2010 (period of about 11 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">826 mobile phones, valued at approximately $500,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Proceed</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">April 2010 to November 2010 (period of about 7 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2201 mobile phones, valued at approximately $1.5m</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Proceed</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

372    The offender was employed with the local telecommunications company, M1, as its Accounts Manager for Corporate Sales. His duties included the sale of mobile phones and subscription contracts for mobile voice and/or data communications services to corporate customers. Between April 2008 and November 2010, he made use of his position to misappropriate phones belonging to M1. He did this by falsifying subscription contacts purportedly entered into by corporate customers. Under the terms of these contracts, the corporate customers would be entitled to free or subsidised phones. The offender would raise sales orders based on these falsified contracts. New phones would then be issued by M1 against these sales orders. The offender would intercept these phones before they could be delivered by courier to the corporate customers, by claiming that he would personally deliver them. If the phones were to be sold at a subsidised price (as opposed to being free), he would pay the subsidised price.

373    The offender would then convert these phones to his own use by selling them to third parties for cash, at or near their retail prices. To avoid detection, he intercepted and disposed of the falsified contracts before the relevant department in M1 could activate them. In some cases, he would falsify the contracts in a way he knew they would be rejected and returned to him to rectify – and when this happened, he would not follow up. His actions were uncovered during an internal reorganisation in November 2010. When confronted by M1 on 15 November 2010, he made a full confession. M1 then referred the matter to the police.

374    Investigations established that the offender converted 3,085 phones in all, and made approximately $2m from selling them. The estimated total loss to M1 was about $2.059m (being the difference between the retail price of the phones and the subsidised price the offender paid). The offender spent the monies obtained on luxury cars, watches, and bags. Accounting for the recovery of some of these items, the estimated total loss to M1 was at about $1.1m. The offender did not make any restitution for this shortfall.

375    The offender received the _same_ sentence of five years’ imprisonment for both charges under s 408 of the Penal Code:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="71.48%"> <col width="28.52%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Property dishonestly converted</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence imposed</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">826 mobile phones, valued at approximately <b>$500,000</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2201 mobile phones, valued at approximately <b>$1.5m</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

376    One of these sentences was ordered to run consecutively with the sentence of one year’s imprisonment for one of the charges for converting property representing the benefits of criminal conduct. The total sentence imposed was hence six years’ imprisonment. The offender appealed against the sentences. His appeal was later deemed withdrawn when no petition of appeal was filed.

377    I found _Matthew Yeo_ to be of limited assistance in calibrating the total sentence in this case. This was for four reasons. First, the sentences imposed in _Matthew Yeo_ were never considered by an appellate court (unlike _Destry Tan_ and _Xie Ming Liang_). Second, a sentencing discount was merited in _Matthew Yeo_ because the offender pleaded guilty.[^569]

378     Third, the monetary loss to M1 (or the harm caused by the offender’s offences) was not $2m but about half of that at $.1.1m. I was aware that the District Court in _Matthew Yeo_ was of the view that “the \[fortuitous\] recovery of the items \[was\] of limited mitigation and clearly not evidence of any contriteness on the part of the \[offender\]”.[^570] It also held the view that such recovery did “not have the same standing as that of an offender making restitution out of \[his\] own volition and remorse even before his misdeeds come to light”.[^571] That said, it _did_ recognise that “the amount recovered does have some mitigating value”.[^572] It would have been wrong, in principle, to punish the offender in _Matthew Yeo_ as if the measure of loss to M1 (and the harm caused) was in fact $2m. After all, the severity of an offence must be assessed by having regard to the principal parameters of harm caused and the offender’s culpability.[^573]_Matthew Yeo_ did not therefore support the simple proposition that the misappropriation of $2m should _ipso facto_ attract five years’ imprisonment for an offence under s 408 of the Penal Code.

379     Fourth, the District Court had imposed the _same_ sentence in respect of _both_ charges under s 408 of the Penal Code – although the stated loss to M1 (_sans_ recovery, the quantum of which was, in any event, unclear with respect to each charge) in relation to one charge ($500,000) was _thrice_ that in relation to the other charge ($1.5m).[^574] In doing so, the court reasoned as follows:

> 49.    In conclusion, I find that a substantial custodial sentence is warranted in the present case and taking into account all the aggravating factors highlighted above and the lack of any strong mitigating circumstances, the appropriate sentence is 6 years. Taking into consideration that I would have to order at least 2 sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively, I impose a period of 5 years for the criminal breach of trust offence\[s\] and 1 year’s imprisonment for the…charges \[under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act\] and order that one sentence from each category to run consecutively totalling 6 years.

380    This global approach to sentencing was consistent with that stated in _PP v Teo Cheng Kiat_.[^575] There, the High Court remarked as follows:

> 3     **The ten Charges in the present case involve sums of money ranging from $988,000 to $6 million.** Like \[_Wong Kai Chuen Phillip v PP_\], the Charges here have been divided into convenient periods of time and relate to different bank accounts. **The individual sums of money involved in each Charge are therefore not quite as important as the total amount of money misappropriated** in all the 25 criminal breach of trust Charges. Similarly, **the individual sentences are not of so much practical significance as the aggregate of the sentences finally imposed.**

> …

> 10    As I have indicated earlier, in a case such as this **where there are multiple Charges, it is of no real practical significance what the individual sentences ought to be. I will not therefore try to tailor each sentence according to the amounts misappropriated**…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

381    The global approach to sentencing was, however, later rejected by the High Court in _PP v Syamsul Hilal bin Ismail_ (“_Syamsul_”)[^576] for “putting the cart before the horse”:

> 25    Before I move on to explain my perception as to the appropriate sentence for the offences in question, some observations should be made of the…District Judge’s sentencing approach. It was apparent from the GD that the…District Judge first took the provisional view that a global sentence of around nine to ten months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for all the offences which the Respondent had committed and on that basis worked backwards to determine the sentence per charge for each of the three categories of offences proceeded on…Undoubtedly, his provisional view on the global sentence to be imposed on the Respondent had directly influenced his determination of the appropriate sentence for each of the individual offences.

> 26    In my view, the better and more logical approach would have been to first determine the sentences for the individual offences by having regard to the respective sentencing precedents, before stepping back for a holistic perspective in order to determine which sentences should be ordered to run consecutively to make for an appropriate global sentence. This two-stage approach was alluded to by V K Rajah JA in _ADF v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span> at \[92\]:

>> …Where multiple distinct offences have been committed, sentencing is a two-stage process. First, the sentence for each individual offence had to be determined. Second, the court has to determine whether the sentences for these multiple offences ought to run concurrently or consecutively and if consecutively, which combination of sentences ought to be made and whether the overall sentence properly comprehends the criminality of the multiple offender…

> 27    Keeping the two stages distinct would allow for a more principled approach in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed for each individual offence than if the court were to determine the same by working backwards from a pre-conceived global sentence. This is because a court would generally not be able to properly comprehend the overall criminality of the multiple offender (so as to determine an appropriate global sentence) unless it first comes to grips with the individual offences by going through the exercise of determining the appropriate sentence for each offence (in this case, due to the large number of charges, beginning by determining an appropriate sentence per charge for each of the categories of offences would have been acceptable), having regard to the applicable sentencing precedents. To begin by first considering and determining the appropriate global sentence would be like putting the cart before the horse.

382    The two-stage approach to sentencing in _Syamsul_ is now established law.[^577]

383    Because the global approach to sentencing was adopted in _Matthew Yeo_, this “directly influenced \[the\] determination of the appropriate sentence for each of the individual offences”.[^578] It was apparent that the court in _Matthew Yeo_ had determined the appropriate sentences to impose for each individual offence by working backwards from its pre-conceived global sentence of six years’ imprisonment. I therefore did not think that the sentences imposed in _Matthew Yeo_ (whether the individual sentences or the total sentence) were reliable indicators to calibrate the sentences in this case.

#### Luciana Lim

384    The offender (who had no antecedents) faced 11 charges.[^579] These included two under s 408 of the Penal Code. She pleaded guilty to four charges. The most serious of these four charges was one of the charges under s 408 of the Penal Code. This involved her dishonest conversion of wines and spirits worth a total of $6,370,280.48 between July 2012 and June 2013. The wines and spirits belonged to a company (dealing in such products) that employed her as a relationship manager.[^580] She had placed numerous fraudulent orders for expensive alcohol on credit under the names of fictitious clients during this six-month period. She then sold the alcohol (with a retail value of $6,370,280.48) and retained the proceeds. The _unusual_ facts in _Luciana Lim_ were summarised by the High Court in _Kavitha_, as it explained why the culpability of the offenders in both cases was _less_ than the “median criminal breach of trust offender”:

> 24    …_Luciana Lim_…concerned criminal breach of trust by a clerk or servant **who committed the offence due to harassment by unlicensed moneylenders rather than for pecuniary gain**…**Crucially, she derived no pecuniary benefit from the offence. She used the moneys to pay debts owed to illegal moneylenders, and committed the offences while labouring under significant pressure due to harassment by them. \[T\]he offender was not herself the borrower from the illegal moneylenders, but was a trusting friend who had agreed to stand as guarantor for a loan taken out by a former colleague.** At first instance, the district court held that an appropriate starting point was a nine-year imprisonment term. The offender was given a one-third discount on account of the mitigating factors, **particularly her reason for the commission of the offence and the fact that she had derived no pecuniary benefit from the crime.** Hence, she was sentenced to only six years’ imprisonment for the offence under s 408 of the Penal Code.

> 25    On appeal, the Prosecution argued that the district court had given undue weight to the offender’s absence of personal greed as a mitigating factor. **Applying the principles set out above on the role of motive in sentencing, See JC held that an offender who** **_does not_** **commit criminal breach of trust for personal gain is less culpable, relatively speaking, than the median criminal breach of trust offender (at \[56\]). Hence, he agreed with the district court’s assessment that the case was unusual and that the sentence could not readily be benchmarked against cases where the offender committed the crime for personal gain.** The district court was entitled to find that the offender’s culpability was significantly reduced and to afford her an appropriate sentencing discount (at \[63\]).

> 26    Applying the principles set out in _Luciana Lim_, with which I agree, it was apparent that the appellant’s reason for committing the offence in this case, which was her fear arising from the threats made by the unlicensed moneylender, particularly in relation to her young son, was a less culpable motive, which warranted the imposition of a lower sentence…To put it another way, **the appellant was clearly less culpable than the offenders in the sentencing precedents which the prosecution had relied on. There was no indication that the offences in those cases had been committed for reasons other than greed and avarice. Thus it would be wrong to benchmark the appellant’s sentence against those precedents.**

> \[emphasis in original; emphasis added in bold\]

385    In _Luciana Lim_, the High Court also gave weight to the “cooperation \[the offender\] rendered the authorities in the course of the investigations”[^581]:

> 73    …On the one hand, I was mindful that the harm caused by the accused far exceeds that in any of the four cases I have referred to because of the sheer quantum of the loss sustained by \[the company\]. **On the other hand, however, the accused was far less culpable than any of the aforementioned offenders, all of whom were motivated by avarice and many of whom led lavish lifestyles with their ill-gotten gains before they were prosecuted. There were many unique features of this case which called out for special attention, such as the absence of a desire for personal gain, the pressure placed on the accused by the harassment, and the co-operation she rendered the authorities in the course of the investigations.** When I considered the facts in their totality, it seemed to me that the sentence of six years’ imprisonment imposed by the District Judge in respect of the CBT charge and the global sentence of seven years’ imprisonment was neither manifestly excessive nor manifestly inadequate.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

386    Counsel argued that Quah should be sentenced to a total “imprisonment term of between 48 to 60 months, _ie_, 4 to 5 years \[only\]” because:[^582]

> (a)     unlike the offender in _Luciana Lim_ who received six years’ imprisonment for misappropriating nearly $6.4m, Quah had misappropriated less than $1m.

> (b)     the High Court in _Luciana Lim_ had recognised that between five to six years’ imprisonment should be imposed where between $1m and $2m are misappropriated, and Quah had misappropriated less than $1m.

387     _Luciana Lim_ supported neither of these points. First, it was clear that the sentence of six years’ imprisonment in _Luciana Lim_ was because of its “unique features” which made the offender “far less culpable” than the “median criminal breach of trust offender”.[^583] These features were absent in this case. In addition, unlike the instant case, there was no evidence in _Luciana Lim_ that the offender (who had also pleaded guilty):[^584]

> (a)     had been “entrusted with any special level of responsibility”; and

> (b)     “took any particular steps to avoid detection”.

388     Second, the High Court in _Luciana Lim_ did _not_ in fact recognise that between five to six years’ imprisonment should be imposed where between $1m and $2m are misappropriated. The court was simply setting out the Prosecution’s sentencing position based on three cases it had tendered – namely, two unreported cases and _Matthew Yeo_. Indeed, the court declined to “derive a sentencing range \[for the quantum involved in _Luciana Lim_\] from such a small sample size (particularly considering the circumspection with which unreported decisions are generally viewed)”. In addition, the High Court referred to _Matthew Yeo_ only because it was comparable in “terms of _modus operandi_ and level of culpability”. At no point did it endorse any sentencing position based on the misappropriated quantum _alone_. I reproduce the relevant paragraphs in _Luciana Lim_:

> 68    As far as the precedents were concerned, the Prosecution cautioned against reliance on the older cases and submitted that there had been a “clear upward trend in the sentences for such offences in recent years”. **They drew my attention to the following three decisions of the District Court –** **_PP v Lee Han Boon Adrian_** **DAC 911016/2014, P****_P v Koh Mui Hoong_** **DAC 500714/2013**, **_PP v Yeo Kay Keng Matthew_** **<span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 425</span> (“****_Matthew Yeo_****”) – all of which involved the misappropriation of between $1m and $2m and in respect of which sentences of between five and six years’ imprisonment were imposed.** Extrapolating from this, they submitted that the starting point of nine years’ imprisonment arrived at by the District Judge was too low and that a starting point of between ten and 12 years’ imprisonment ought to have been ordered instead. With respect, I could not agree with this.

> 69    There is no question that the amount of money misappropriated is an important sentencing consideration. Generally, the larger the amount misappropriated, the more severe the punishment that should be meted out. However, it has been emphasised in past cases that while the punishments imposed for CBT offences ought to increase in severity with the amounts misappropriated, the sentences “do not bear a relationship of linear proportionality with the sums involved” (see _PP v Tan Cheng Yew_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 1095</span> (“_Tan Cheng Yew_”) at \[184\]). The fact that proportionately higher punishments were imposed for offences involving smaller sums of money does not, without more, imply that the District Judge had selected an inappropriate starting point or that the eventual sentence she arrived at was manifestly inadequate. **I also did not think it possible to derive a sentencing range from such a small sample size (particularly considering the circumspection with which unreported decisions are generally viewed**: see _Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 707</span> at \[21\]).

> 70     **When I turned to consider the precedents cited, there were four which I found particularly helpful. In terms of** **_modus operandi_** **and level of culpability, I considered** **_Matthew Yeo_** **to be comparable**….

> 71     **In terms of the quantum**, the closest precedents which were cited were the cases of _Joachim Kang Hock Chai v PP_ DAC 156/2003 and _PP v Kwek Chee Tong_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 194</span>….

> 72    I also had regard to the case of _Tan Cheng Yew_ which, though far more aggravated in many respects, also provided a useful point of reference \[in terms of quantum\]…

#### Christopher Foong

389    The offender (who had no antecedents) was an “administrative assistant” in a company. He was its only full-time employee, and there was no one to check on his work. Apart from the offender, the company employed an accountant on a part-time basis. The director of the company was one Budi Agusalim, an Indonesian national.

390    The offender was given electronic banking access to the company’s three bank accounts with UOB, to check the balances in these accounts.

391    While employed by the company, he incorporated a company (“Paminco”) in Malaysia. Paminco never had any dealings with the company.

392    Sometime in 2006, Budi needed the bank accounts statements of the company to put up its financial report. The offender failed to give these to Budi, and made excuses for not being able to do so. Budi eventually called UOB sometime in August 2006, and sought the bank statements for the past 2 months. On receiving these statements, he discovered that fraudulent transactions had been made _via_ internet banking to Paminco.

393    On 24 August 2006, Budi’s son lodged a police report alleging that the offender has misappropriated monies belonging to the company. When Budi’s son attended at the company’s office the following day, he saw the resignation letter of the offender (dated 15 August 2006), with the offender’s salary of $2,000 enclosed (in cash). Investigations showed that the offender had left Singapore for Malaysia on 19 August 2006.

394    The offender was arrested when he returned to Singapore on 6 February 2013. During investigations, he lied that Budi had instructed him to incorporate Paminco and to transfer not more than USD$50,000 per month to it (apparently because Budi needed to “park” monies in Malaysia in case Singapore, which was in elections mode at that time, changed its policy concerning trading in Singapore). The offender eventually admitted that he had transferred monies from the company’s bank accounts to Paminco to help with his “personal expenses in Malaysia” when he left “Singapore into Malaysia”.

395    The offender faced five charges, for misappropriating a total of $1,321,050.25 between 3 March 2004 and 18 August 2006. No restitution was made. He pleaded guilty to three charges. The two remaining two charges were considered in sentencing. The charges were _all_ punishable under s 408 of the 1985 Penal Code, with imprisonment not exceeding seven years.

396    The key details of all five charges are set out in the table below:

![]([2020] SGDC 0066_Image/[2020] SGDC 0066_image5.png)

397    The District Court reasoned as follows before sentencing the offender:

> 4     **The prescribed punishment under s 408 of the Penal Code at the time the offences were committed was imprisonment of up to 7 years and/or to a fine.**

> 5    Several aggravating factor were present:-

>> (a)    The amount involved was large. For the proceeded charges, the amount involved was about $1,197,000. When the TIC charges were included, the total amount involved was about $1,321,000.

>> (b)    The trust reposed was high. The accused was the sole full-time employee of the company. There were few (if any) checks on him. He had full electronic access to the company’s accounts with UOB bank. He took advantage of the trust placed in him to commit the offences.

>> (c)    The offences were committed over an extended period of about two and a half years. The first offence was committed in March 2004 while the final offence (which was for the largest sum) was committed in August 2006. Shortly after the commission of the last offence, the accused absconded to Malaysia.

>> (d)    There was planning and pre-meditation. The accused had incorporated a company with his wife in Malaysia and opened a bank account for it. Thereafter, he transferred the company’s money to the Malaysian company’s bank account without authorisation or consent.

>> (e) No restitution was made.

> 6    In sentencing the accused, I also took into account the mitigating factors in his favour. He had no antecedents. **He had pleaded guilty, which was an indication of his remorse. He informed the court that he had surrendered 5 years ago and had since been waiting to plead guilty.** He also stated that he co-operated with investigations and provided information to the best of his recollection. It was also apparent that the accused had health issues as he had diabetes and gout.

> …

> 13    As the amount which the accused had misappropriated was large, sentence should correspondingly be high. Many aggravating factors were also present. **I was however of the view that the prosecution’s submission for a total of 8 years’ imprisonment was too high. The offences were also committed between 2004 and 2006.** Having considered the accused’s culpability, the harm caused and the aggravating and mitigating factors, I was of the view that for the 2nd and 3rd charges (which involved about SGD 273,000 and SGD 276,000) the appropriate sentence would be 2 years’ imprisonment for each charge. For the 5th charge (which involved about SGD 638,000), I was of the view that a term of 4 years’ imprisonment was appropriate.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

398    The court imposed the following sentences:

![]([2020] SGDC 0066_Image/[2020] SGDC 0066_image6.png)

399    The Prosecution discontinued its appeal against the sentences imposed.[^585]

400    I did not find Counsel’s submissions[^586] persuasive for three reasons. First, the charges in _Christopher Foong_ were all punishable under s 408 of the 1985 Penal Code – with up to seven years’ imprisonment (only). The charges in the instant case were all punishable under s 408 of the Penal Code – with up to 15 years’ imprisonment. This was clearly a factor that weighed heavily in the decision of the District Court (and rightfully so[^587]), when it differed from the Prosecution’s submissions for a total sentence of at least 8 years’ imprisonment – and imposed a total sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment instead.[^588]

401     Second, it appears that the District Court also gave significant weight to the offender having returned to Singapore to surrender some six years after he fled to Malaysia.[^589] This would possibly explain why the individual sentences and the total sentence in _Christopher Foong_ were identical to those imposed in in _Choo Mui v PP_[^590], which involved fewer charges and a smaller quantum.

402    The offender in _Choo Mui_ was a secretary in a company. She was entrusted with its chequebooks, and authorised to issue cheques to pay its suppliers. Between January 1997 and April 1998 (a period of 15 months), she credited these cheques into her personal bank account – misappropriating a total of $677,837.63 in the process (_ie_, about half the total sum misappropriated in _Christopher Foong_). She then failed to turn up for work one day, having taken the company’s accounts and documents with her. She left only a resignation letter. None of the misappropriated monies were recovered. The offender also did not make any restitution. She spent the monies on her personal expenses. She also used the monies to invest in shares and for loans to friends. At the time she was sentenced, she was married with a six-year-old child and expecting another child. She had no prior antecedents. She pleaded guilty to two charges under s 408 of the 1985 Penal Code, and was sentenced as follows:

403    The High Court dismissed the offender’s appeal against sentence.[^591]

404     Third, the sentences imposed in _Christopher Foong_ were never considered by an appellate court (unlike _Destry Tan_ and _Xie Ming Liang_).

##### Conclusion on total sentence

405    Had I ordered all the individual sentences imposed to run consecutively, this would have yielded a total of 149 months’ imprisonment:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.78%"> <col width="70.22%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sum misappropriated</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Appropriate individual sentences</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$127,104.40</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">27 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$169,974.60</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">29 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$174,166.12</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">29 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$221,172.91</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">32 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$227,403.66</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">32 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total sentence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>149 months’ imprisonment</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

406    A total sentence of 149 months’ imprisonment would have been equivalent to a term of 12 years and 5 months. Such a sentence would clearly be substantially above the range of sentences normally imposed for offences under s 408 of the Penal Code.[^592] It would still fall short of the maximum prescribed punishment of 15 years’ imprisonment for an offence under s 408 of the Penal Code. That said, its effect on Quah would likely be crushing and destroy any reasonable expectation of useful life after release. In this regard, I was mindful that Quah was 65 years old[^593] when she was sentenced – and the average life expectancy for females in Singapore was about 85 years as of 2018.[^594] A total sentence of 149 months’ imprisonment was very likely to induce in her a feeling of hopelessness, and destroy all prospects of her subsequent rehabilitation and reintegration.

407    However, I was equally mindful that Quah’s relatively advanced age was also a consequence of the period of time during which she was able to keep her misdeeds concealed. I therefore did not think that her age alone was good enough reason to order only two sentences to run consecutively. This was in light of the overall criminality of her conduct – which was especially evident when the five charges against her were dissected. Each charge did not encompass just one instance of misappropriation, but _multiple_ instances of misappropriation of _distinct_ payments (that she collected from the Clients on different occasions).

408    The many instances of misappropriation encompassed by each of the charges against Quah are set out in the table below.[^595] The figures show that, on average, Quah misappropriated between two to three payments each month, for over nearly five years:

![]([2020] SGDC 0066_Image/[2020] SGDC 0066_image7.png)

409    Her persistent offending (accompanied each time with the manipulation of the Company’s accounting records to hide her misappropriation) called for more than two sentences to run consecutively.[^596] It reflected a more directed criminal intent, and a greater commitment to offending. It heightened her culpability, and showed her total disregard for the law.

410    Having regard to the totality principle, I adjusted the individual sentences downwards; and ordered that only three of these sentences – the longest sentence; the shortest sentence; and the sentence in-between – be run consecutively:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="23.82%"> <col width="42.54%"> <col width="33.64%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Misappropriated</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Appropriate individual sentences</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Adjusted sentences</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$127,104.40</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">27 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$169,974.60</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">29 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">27 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$174,166.12</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">29 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">27 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$221,172.91</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">32 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$227,403.66</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">32 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total sentence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">149 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>81 months’ imprisonment</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

411    The aggregate sentence of 81 months’ imprisonment was equivalent to a term of 6 years’ and 9 months’ imprisonment. This was a proportionate sentence, which best reflected the overall criminality of Quah’s prolonged offending over almost five years – during which she misappropriated more than $919,000. With remission, Quah would likely be released when she is about 70 years old. The total sentence cannot be said to be _manifestly_ excessive, thus requiring substantial alterations to remedy any injustice.[^597]

**Annex A: Quah’s belated testimony on “Cash Withdrawal Practice**” **[^598]**

> Q:    Now, Mdm Quah, \[your Compilation\] contains withdrawals and transactions marked \[funds transfer\] from three of your personal bank accounts….I’m just asking you to confirm, Mdm Quah, we’ve been through this a number of times. \[Your Compilation\] is just a summary of withdrawals and \[funds transfers\] from your \[Cashline Account; Savings Account; and CashPlus Account\].

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **And you accept that \[your Compilation\] is not a tabulation of all cash withdrawals made from these three \[personal\] accounts during the material period? ...In other words, there are cash withdrawals from these 3 bank accounts that are not included in \[your Compilation\]?**

> **A:**      **I agree, yes.**

> Q:    If you could turn with me to AB2 at page 208.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, this is for your \[Cashline Account\]. And you can see with me, on page 208, that there is a cash withdrawal at ATM for $1,000 on the 5th of September 2010. Do you see that, Mdm Quah?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **And if you look back at \[your Compilation\]…and I want you to focus your attention on the right most column \[of the 1st page of the 1st sheet\]. Now, this cash withdrawal for $1,000 on 5th of September 2010 it does not appear in \[your Compilation\], you agree?...You…agree with…me it’s not there?**

> **A:**      **\[M\]aybe the date is wrong.**

> **Q:**     Now, Mdm Quah, we went through very extensively during your Examination-in-Chief, the contents of \[your Compilation\]. And in fact, \[your Compilation\] was the amended, agreed, accurate version. So, the question now is very simple, 5th of September 2010, the bank account statement reflects cash withdrawal at ATM of $1,000. This transaction does not appear in \[your Compilation\]? And to help you, Mdm Quah, perhaps we can start on the 1st page of the first sheet at the line item dated, 2nd September 2010. Okay. So, you see that it goes from 2nd September 2010, the one…after that is 7th September 2010, 15th September 2010, 28 September 2010. And then if you flip over the page, 29th September 2010, and then it goes into October 2010 transactions. **So, it’s very clear, you agree, 5th September 2010, cash withdrawal at ATM of $1,000 does not appear in \[your Compilation\]?**

> **A:**      **I think the entry for the 2nd of September 2010 should be the 5th.**

> Q:    Now, Mdm Quah, I’m just going to ask you one more time. Face value document, there is no line item marked 5th September 2010, you agree?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So, you’re now telling me that actually, it’s a mistake?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    And before you go further, I’m going to explain to you why it’s not a mistake. So, if you go with me to page 206 of AB2? Now, if you look at page \[206\]…\[t\]here is, in fact, a cash withdrawal at ATM for $1,000 on 2nd September 2010?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And that corresponds with \[your Compilation\]?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So, it’s not a mistake?**

> **A:**      **It’s not.**

> **Q:**      **But are you now suggesting to me that the 5th September 2010 cash withdrawal was actually meant to be included in \[your Compilation\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, you are now telling me, suddenly, that it’s $451,400 plus $1,000?**

> **A:**      **Yes**, but I do not want too much trouble. Because I have already prepared this, there’s nothing I can do.

> Q:    So, you are now telling me that you suddenly remembered today, that the $1,000 cash withdrawal on 5th September 2010 is related to the cash cheques from \[EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex\]?

> A:    To put it simply, \[my personal bank account statements were\] given to me. Okay, when I got all these bank documents, I would need to look at them one by one. I would definitely have missed out something. I do not want the trouble, whatever I have put in here it will be based on this. There, I have missed out, we can ignore that. Can we do that?

> **Q:**     Mdm Quah, I think you shouldn’t be asking me questions but I’m just going to summarise. **So, you are telling me that the cash withdrawal on 5th September 2010 is related to the cash cheques \[from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, you may have handed it to \[TSM\]?**

> **A:**      **Definitely.**

> Q:    But because it was very difficult to analyse \[your\] bank account statements, which we disclosed to you…you had suddenly remembered that actually this $1,000 by right…should \[have been\] included in \[your Compilation\]?

> …

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, let’s look at another example. At AB2 again, let’s go to page 212. You can let me know when you are there, Mdm Quah.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Now you see that there are cash withdrawals at ATM on 29th October 2010 and 30th October 2010. You see that? For 29th October 2010, it’s a sum of $200 and for 30th October 2010, it’s a sum of $400?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **And these transactions are not reflected in \[your Compilation\], you agree?...**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So these cash withdrawals were possibly for \[your\] personal expenses, you agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, in fact, you accept that these 3 \[personal\] bank accounts in \[your Compilation\] you also withdrew cash for personal expenses?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, in reality, for the transaction that we went through before this, the transaction on 5th September 2010 for $1,000, it is completely possible that you withdrew that money for \[your\] personal expenses?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **You have no way of telling whether this \[withdrawal of $1,000 on 5th September 2010\] was related to the cash cheques \[you collected from EDS, Win Tran, and Time-Flex\] or not?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **You have no system?**

> **A:**      **If I have had a system, I wouldn’t have been cheated by others.**

> **Q:**      **Mdm Quah, I don’t think this is a trial about you being cheated by others but, again, I’m going to ask you to agree. You have no system of telling which cash withdrawals are for handing money to \[TSM\] and which are for personal expenses?**

> **A:**      **Whatever I have handed over to \[TSM\] would usually be in 500 or 1,000 dollars---or 800. My own personal usage---for my own personal usage, I would only withdraw 200 or 400 in case, I needed to buy something.**

> Q:    You said, “Usually.” So clearly, there are exceptions?

> A:    Okay, for those that I withdrew for my own expenses, I would withdr\[a\]w less than 500. Because I needed to know for myself that…every time, whenever I gave to \[TSM\] would be in 500 or 1,000. For the last…3 transactions, because he wanted to…withdraw all the money, so---because at that time, I have already resigned. He wants me to give back the whole amount in \[my personal bank accounts\] to him. So for \[the Cashline Account\] in August 2014, you would see 3 transactions of 800 each.

> **Q:**      **So now, your explanation is that for withdrawals of 500, 800 and 1,000, it’s not that you usually give it to \[TSM\], now it’s always?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, I’m giving you a chance to finalise your evidence, because earlier you said, “Usually.”**

> **A:**      **Every time. I want to use that as a mark---the 500 and---1,000…dollars.**

> **Q:**      **And this is the---first---time you are giving this explanation that you know that it’s for \[TSM\].**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **…You didn’t explain this in your Examination-in-Chief even though you would agree it’s quite an important point.**

> **A:**      **I don’t know.**

> Q:    Because on \[your\] bank statements, cash withdrawals just appear as “Cash withdrawals” at ATM?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And as I have pointed out to you earlier, there are examples, the 5th September 2010 one of the withdrawals of $1,000 that \[was\] not in \[your Compilation\]?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So, in reality, Mdm Quah, actually, you have no way of knowing whether the cash withdrawals are for your personal expenses or for handing to \[TSM\]?**

> **A:**      **I have already stated that in every bank, whether it’s UOB or DBS, I would just use 500 and 1,000 as a mark to indicate that I have handed…these \[sums\] to TSM. To me, it’s more convenient.**

> Q:    Okay.

> A:    \[F\]or my personal expenses, I would withdraw less than 500.

> Q:    So, it’s now a convenience issue…

> A:    What do you mean?

> **Q:**      **You chose to withdraw $500 and $1,000 because according to you, it was convenient for you?**

> **A:**      **It is more convenient for me because when I have \[these sums\] to \[TSM\], I did not calculate. I just give them to him.**

> **Q:**      **So, you accept that no matter what the sum in the cash cheque \[you\] deposit\[ed\] into your account, you could choose how much to withdraw?**

> **A:**      **I agree but every time when I wanted to deposit the \[cash\] cheque, I would sit down with \[TSM\] to discuss. He said since you did not want to go to the bank counters to get the money, it’s very troublesome. You could---every day after the cheque was banked in, I could start to get money…for him…from the bank account 2:00pm the next day.**

> **Q:**      **Now, Mdm Quah, you claimed that all these meetings happened with \[TSM\], you have offered no explanation as to who authorised you to only withdraw 500 or 1,000 dollars?**

> **A:**      **It was \[TSM\] who wanted me to do this.**

> **Q:**      **First time you are saying this?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    So, now again, on the 2nd day of your Cross-Examination, you are raising another new fact which is you had meetings with \[TSM where\]…he told you to deposit cash cheques into your personal bank account and no matter what the sum was, only withdraw in denominations of 500, 1,000 or maybe sometimes 800.

> A:    $800 was only for the last year, 2014.

> **Q:**      **Fine, we’ll confine it to 500 or 1,000 dollars. So, you are now saying for the first time, that it was \[TSM\] who told you to withdraw in denominations of 500 and $1,000. This is the first time you are raising this, do you agree or do you disagree, Mdm Quah?**

> **A:**      **I agree.**

> **Q:**      **This was not put to \[TSM\] even though he came to Court to give evidence, you agree or disagree?**

> **A:**      **Yes, I agree.**

> **Q:**      **So, what you are saying is that even if the cash cheque was for a very specific sum of money with decimal points…you could choose what to withdraw?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **You could let the rest of the money mix in your personal bank accounts. You agree?**

> **A:**      **I agree** but when we do the accounts, usually the cash cheques given to us by our customers, there will be dollars and cents. We’ll round the figure up. For example…if it’s $549, we will round up to 550. We would not include the remaining. Even though that will be included in my bank account…**That was why it was agreed between \[TSM\] and myself that it would be easier to see if it’s 500 or 1,000 because he would look at my bank statements every month, every year.**

> **Q:**      **Okay, So, Mdm Quah, again, I have given you quite a lot of latitude to explain yourself. And you’ve raised a lot of new facts. You agree with me?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, now it’s not just that you met with \[TSM\], it’s that \[TSM\] checked your bank account statements?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And \[TSM\] was the one who told you only withdraw…500 and 1,000?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So you can let the cash cheque balance, however much it may be, mix with your personal funds in your bank accounts?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **You can apply it to your personal expenses? You can apply it to your personal expenses, yes or no?**

> **A:**      **I agree but---**

> **Q:**      **You agree? That was the question. And you know that it’s actually company money, agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    So, if you spend company money on your personal expenses, that’s actually dishonest?

> A:    Is there such a possibility?

> Q:    Simple proposition, Mdm Quah. If you use company money on your personal expenses, that’s dishonest.

> A:    I have already said---

> Q:    Yes or no, Mdm Quah. Using company money for personal expenses, is it dishonest?

> A:    No, I disagree.

> …

> **Q:**      **So let me re-summarise the proposition for you. Are you trying to tell me that it’s not dishonest if \[TSM\] gave you permission?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **But if \[TSM\] did not give you permission, it would be dishonest, you agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, whether \[TSM\] gave you permission is, in fact, a very important fact for your defence.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And in spite of that, you have raised all these new facts that were not put to \[TSM\].**

> **A:**      **Nobody asked me**.

> Q:    Mdm Quah, you have been assisted by counsel and you have been given adequate opportunity to cross-examine \[TSM\]. So, I’m not going to waste too much time on that point…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

**Annex B: Quah’s testimony on cashier’s order**

> Q:    Now, Mdm Quah, earlier in Cross-Examination, the \[Prosecution\] had put it to you that it was illogical for you to withdraw the cashier’s order of $50,000 from your joint account just to transfer to \[your Savings Account\]. You disagreed and then you said that you had your reasons. Do you remember that?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Okay. Can you now inform the Court what are your reasons?

> A:    \[The account\] is a joint account between me and Johnny Quah. Johnny Quah is my nephew. Before his father passed away, \[his father\] had a sum of money with me…So out of this 50,000 \[that I lent TSM\] there was this 40,000 that…belonged to Johnny Quah. His father wanted him to study. And this money \[was\] meant for his studies. He was studying in Ngee Ann Poly. His school fees would be deducted from the \[Joint Account\] by GIRO. The reason I took this 50,000 out of the \[Joint Account\] was because I did not want to implicate \[my nephew\]. I transferred the money by way of cashier’s order to \[my Savings Account\]. And I wanted \[my nephew\] to open another OCBC account. I know that it is wrong to do this transferring. Because this 40,000 was meant for Johnny’s studies.

> Q:    But Mdm Quah, you said that you didn’t want to implicate Johnny, what is it that you did not want to implicate him in?

> A:    When this 50,000 was deposited into \[my Joint Account\], I told \[TSM\] that 40,000 of this money did not belong to me. It was what I \[had\] borrowed \[from my nephew\]. And then \[TSM\] said, “You can…go to the bank and withdraw 50,000.” And return to \[TSM\] and then he would issue a cheque but why would I want this? Because I did not want to work anymore. I have already tendered by resignation. I have been…asking \[TSM\] to pay me this 50,000 but he refused to do so. He said, “You can take Eric Ho’s cheques to bank into \[your Joint Account\]. I told him, “By doing this, you would implicate me and my nephew. If there is a CBT case, then we would be in big trouble.” He said, “No.” He said that, “You…can bring the…cashier’s order back to office and I will sign for you. And then you don’t owe me anything, I don’t owe you anything.” He signed on the photocopy of this cashier’s order and he took it. But in my computer, I have written down…the circumstances in which he gave me the money. And I have also scanned the cashier’s order. But I could not get…\[TSM’s\] signature. Because he wrote in Chinese on the \[photocopy of\] the cashier’s order…and I translated it for him. He wrote in Chinese and I wrote in English. Because \[it was simply\] phrased. “I do not owe you and you do not owe me.” He took the piece of paper but I have a scan of \[the\] cashier’s order in my computer. There is evidence.

> Q:    Okay. Mdm Quah, is there anything more that you wish to clarify regarding this cashier’s order?

> A:    Initially I wanted cash from him but it’s very dangerous. So…the people from OCBC told me that they would give me a cashier’s order. Because if I were to hand over cash of 50,000 to \[TSM\[, I would still need to go back to the office. Would I be able to get my own money if I hand him the 50,000 in cash? Would I be able to get the cheque from him? This 40,000 has been long owing. In March or April, I have already tendered my resignation. If this dragged on, I would never be able to get my money.

**Annex D: TSM’s evidence on Monthly Invoices Spreadsheet**

> Q:    Okay, \[TSM\], let’s be clear. \[Fion\] says that there \[are\] Excel spreadsheets in a blue file and on that Excel spreadsheet, it contains information about the amount of the diesel invoices. Are you saying that no such Excel spreadsheet exists?

> A:    No, there is. But…Fion would prepare them to see which customer owed how much every month and show it to me.

> Q:    Okay. So, every month, you are keeping track of which customers have made payment or not, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, at the end of each month, you would have known…which customers have made payment and which have not, right?

> A:    Yes.

> …

> Q:    Okay, but \[TSM\], you keep track of customer’s payments each month, right?

> A:    I just look at who owe money and was the money paid.

> Q:    So, how do you verify whether the customer actually made payment or not?

> A:    Because every month, it will be printed out from January, February, March and when I see, oh, why this person did not make payment a month, 2 months were owing or 3 months were owing, then I would remind him. So, my responsibility would be to make sure whether this person owed money for a long time and I would go and…remind \[Quah\] to collect payment.

> Q:    Yes, \[TSM\], that is precisely the point, right? You do keep track of which customers have made payment every month.

> A:    Yes, I know whether payment was made but I wouldn’t know whether it would be in cash or in cheque.

> **Q:**      **Okay. So you are saying that you will know whether the customer has made payment or not, right?**

> **A:**      **No, if \[Quah\] cancelled it, that means payment was made. If \[Quah\] did not cancel, that means payment was not made.**

> Q:    So, you were also keeping an eye on customers who have not paid their invoices, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And if from your records, the customer has not paid, you would have reminded \[Quah\] to go and collect payment, right?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So, \[TSM\]…I’m going to put it to you that you actually had a system of checking invoices and keeping tracking of payment from customers. Do you agree or disagree?**

> **A:**      **I only take a look at what \[Quah\] showed me.**

> **Q:**      **\[TSM\], the point is that you do keep track, right?**

> **A:**      **If what was given \[to\] me is wrong, I would not know. So, I only looked at what \[Quah\] gave me.**

> …

> Q:    No, what we have is \[Fion\] saying…that she prepared \[the Monthly Invoice Spreadsheets\] for you on a monthly basis, and these spreadsheets allowed you to keep track of which customers made payment or not…So, do you agree with that?

> A:    Every month, they would have to prepare a copy and they would put it there for me to look. **It must have been \[Quah\] who give it to \[Fion\], then she would be able to prepare.**

> Q:    Okay. So, coming back to my question, you have a system of keeping track of payments from customers every month, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, you must have known when customers have made payment or when their invoices have become overdue, right?

> A:    By right, I should know.

> …

> **Q:**      **Okay, \[TSM\], that’s the difficulty that we are facing. On one hand, you have accepted that you have a system of keeping track of payment from customers. So, you must have known whether the money actually comes into the company, right? Do you agree?**

> **A:**      **To put it simply, if I can have everything checked so clearly, today I wouldn’t have had money all missing.**

> Q:    \[TSM\], please listen to the question.

> A:    I have already answered the question.

> Q:    Okay, I’ll repeat the question again. You have a system of keeping track of payments from customers. And I put it to you, as a result of that system, you would have also checked whether money actually came into the company.

> A:    I disagree with what you said.

> …

> **Q:**      **And if the customer had made payment by way of a cheque issued to the \[Company’s\] name, you would have checked the \[Company’s Account\] to make sure that the cheque cleared?**

> **A:**      **That’s why I did not check. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had money missing.**

> …

> **Q:**      **And the fact of the matter was that you were keeping track of customer’s payments and you were keeping track of the monies actually received by the \[Company\]. And that is why you have never \[made\] any complaint to the police or the auditors, you agree?**

> **A:**      **But when I check you must know what I checked. I only checked that to make sure that these customers are not owing money for too long. Because if the debts \[are\] for more than 2 or 3 months then…I must chase after them because my money is to be paid to the diesel company so if I don’t --- if not, I won’t have enough money to make payment. So I cannot allow payment to be dragged on for too long.**

[^240]: The Compilation included 17 entries marked “FT”, which referred to “funds transfer” from Quah’s Cashline Account: Day 8, p 51, lines 8-13. In cross-examination, Quah testified that she could only withdraw a maximum of $1,000 a day from her Cashline Account. She said that if she needed to withdraw more than $1,000 on any given day from her Cashline Account, she would have to go to a branch of DBS Bank and produce her ATM card at a counter. According to Quah, DBS Bank would consider such over-the-counter withdrawals as a “funds transfer”: Day 9, pp 46-47. The entries marked “FT” in the Compilation referred to such over-the-counter withdrawals. In chambers, I had asked the Prosecution to verify this with DBS Bank (see also Day 10, p 12). After doing so, the Prosecution did not dispute Quah’s evidence in this regard.

This means the sentence for the accused would have been 40 months’ imprisonment. However, I was of the view than an imprisonment of three years’ would be adequate to serve the ends of justice”: _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) at p 798.

[^580]: The second charge under s 408 of the Penal Code was considered in sentencing. It involved the dishonest conversion of wines and spirits worth a total of $650,943.66 between June 2011 and June 2012.

[^581]: The offender surrendered to the police three days after the company lodged a report and confessed her misdeeds. At \[51\], the District Court noted that the offender “assisted to compile the list of buyers and their addresses to assist the company to recover the misappropriated wines…This would have saved the resources of the authorities in tracing the fraudulent transactions and was an indication of her remorse. I noted that a total 1,102 bottles were recovered from the buyers. I gave weight to her cooperation with authorities...” These observations were not disturbed on appeal.

[^601]: The sum stated in the Summation was $575,788.89. This sum has been adjusted downwards by $6,000 to reflect the fact that a cash cheque from Win Tran, that was dated 27 September 2013 and for the amount of $16,537.70 (**P9**), had bounced when Quah tried to deposit it into her Cashline Account (**AB2**, p 318). That said, Quah confirmed that she had subsequently deposited a cash cheque from EDS or Win Tran for the sum of $10,537.70 into her Cashline Account. This sum belonged to the Company, and would have formed part of the Entrusted Monies. See Day 9, p 43, line 19 to p 44, line 23.
