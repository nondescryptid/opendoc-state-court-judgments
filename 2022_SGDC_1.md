## Statement of Facts

3       The SOF setting out the facts in relation to the offences committed by the Accused is reproduced in full below:

STATEMENT OF FACTS

(Incorporating 3 charges)

> Accused

> The accused is Mohamad Azmil bin Abdullah, a 34 -year-old Singaporean bearing NRIC No. XXX. At the material time of the offences, the accused worked as a Grab delivery rider.

> THE 1ST CHARGE (DAC-915359-2021)

> First Information Report

> On 6 August 2021 at or around 2:06pm, one Ho Zhi Ming, the shop supervisor of the Maxi-Cash Retail Pte Ltd pawnshop located at 30 Eunos Crescent #01-13, Singapore 409423 (“the pawnshop”) lodged a police report at MacPherson Neighbourhood Police Post that CCTV footage captured two men entering the pawnshop and using a metal stick to hook a gold bracelet valued at $3,140.00 out of a display case in the pawnshop.

> Facts

> The day before, on 5 August 2021 at or around noontime, the accused met up with his friend, one Mohammad Ridzuan bin Hasan (“Ridzuan”), at City Plaza shopping mall located at 810 Geylang Road, Singapore, to hang out. Later in the afternoon, they headed to the pawnshop, as Ridzuan wanted to sell his bracelet which he wore on his left wrist.

> When the accused and Ridzuan entered the pawnshop, there were two attendant staff. One of them attended to Ridzuan as he wanted to sell his bracelet, while another staff member attended to a female customer. In the meantime, the accused browsed one of the display shelves in the pawnshop, which contained numerous gold items. He saw that there were gaps on the side of the display shelf, and realised that he could easily steal a gold bracelet (“the gold bracelet”) which was on display near the gap of the display shelf. The accused informed Ridzuan of the gap and the gold bracelet, and told him that he had no tool to pull the gold bracelet out of the gap. Ridzuan then took out a metal chopstick from his bag, discreetly handed it over to the accused, and returned to the attendant staff to continue pawning his own bracelet.

> At or around 3:00pm, the accused guided the chopstick through the display shelf and hooked onto the gold bracelet. He managed to lift and drop the gold bracelet onto the side of display shelf, and he thereafter attempted to remove it from the display shelf with his right hand. As the gold bracelet was tied to the display shelf, the accused only managed to pull the gold bracelet partially out of the shelf. The accused told Ridzuan about this, and Ridzuan told him to try pulling it harder. The accused then successfully yanked the gold bracelet out of the display shelf, albeit snapping the gold bracelet in the process.

> Throughout this time, the staff did not notice the accused’s actions. Ridzuan ensured this by positioning himself in between the staff and the accused, such that the staff could not see what the accused was doing. The accused stashed the gold bracelet, and once Ridzuan successfully pawned his own bracelet off, they both left the pawnshop.

> By virtue of the foregoing, in the furtherance of the common intention of both the accused and Ridzuan, the accused committed theft in the pawnshop, a building used for the custody of property, by dishonestly taking the gold bracelet out of the possession of Ho Zhi Ming, the store supervisor of the pawnshop. The accused has therefore committed an offence under section 380 read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”).

> The gold bracelet is valued at $3,140.00.

> The accused and Ridzuan agreed to pawn off the gold bracelet for cash. They did so at the ValueMax pawnshop located at Blk 213 Bedok North Street 1, Singapore, for $2,400. The accused and Ridzuan split the proceeds; the accused purchased a handlebar bag, a USB rechargeable light, two pairs of riding gloves, and an A16 Oppo handphone. Ridzuan spent away his share of the proceeds on purchasing one “Vivo” handphone, repaying about $600 in friendly loans, and spent the remaining on daily expenses.

> The purchased items have since been seized from both the accused and Ridzuan. The gold bracelet has been seized from the ValueMax pawnshop.

> THE 3RD CHARGE (DAC-917894-2021)

> First Information Report

> On 17 August 2021 at or around 8:07am, one Ang Ah Kee dialled the police to inform that her apartment located at Blk 767 Bedok Reservoir View #XXX, Singapore 470767 (“Unit #XXX”) had been sprayed with orange paint. When she opened the main door of her unit, she also saw that the words “O$P$” were spray-painted on her neighbouring unit (“Unit #XXX”). She further informed that she and her family members had never borrowed money from unlicensed moneylenders, and believed that her unit was targeted because of her neighbour living in Unit #XXX.

> Facts

> Sometime in June 2021, the accused received a text message from an unknown number offering loans. As the accused was in need of money, he agreed to a loan of $400 from an unlicensed moneylender who addressed himself as “Nick”. The accused initially was able to make weekly repayments to Nick, but was eventually unable to surmount to his debt, and owed about $1,000 to Nick by early August 2021. Nick started to harass the accused’s fiancé, and the accused reached out to Nick about this. Nick suggested to the accused that his debt would be waived if he worked for him, and the accused agreed to this. Nick thereafter instructed the accused to spray paint Unit #XXX, and paste a debtor note at the door which read “P$ Calvin: XXX Jax: XXX #XXX /$$” (“the debtor note”).

> In the early morning of 17 August 2021, the accused headed out of his residence, bringing along with him a can of orange spray paint, the debtor note which he prepared beforehand, masking tape, and a hoodie and cap which he intended to wear to prevent law enforcement from subsequently identifying him. He put on the hoodie and cap at a nearby multi-storey carpark, before heading to the 13th storey of Blk 767 Bedok Reservoir View to carry out Nick’s instructions.

> At around 7:50am, and upon reaching the main door of Unit #XXX, the accused saw multiple CCTV cameras installed outside the said unit. To further prevent his identification, he spray painted the CCTV cameras with orange paint. He then proceeded to spray paint “O$P$” repeatedly on both the main doors of Unit #XXX and Unit #XXX, as well as on the walls surrounding the main doors. He thereafter took out the debtor note and pasted it on the main door of Unit #XXX using masking tape. He returned to the nearby multi-storey carpark to take off his hoodie and cap.

> On the instructions of the unlicensed moneylender Nick, the accused has therefore caused property damage to Unit #XXX, in connection to a loan taken by one Lim Wei Sen Sam, an occupant of the said unit, and which acts were likely to cause annoyance to the said occupant.

> By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under section 28(2) read with section 28(1)(b) and punishable under section 28(2)(a) read with section 28(3)(b)(i) of the MLA.

> THE 4TH CHARGE (DAC-917894-2021)

> First Information Report

> On 12 August 2021 at or about 9:29pm, an unknown informant dialled to notify the police that there were people fighting near Blk 382 Geylang Road, Singapore 389384, and that there was one individual lying motionless on the ground.

> Facts

> On 12 August 2021 at or about 9:07pm, Francis Lee Poh San (“Francis”) was selling keychains to members of public along Lorong 20 Geylang, Singapore. His friend, Ang Chun Seng (“Ah Seng”), accompanied Francis while he was peddling the keychains.

> At or about 9:08pm, one Muhammad Nur Iskandar bin Mokhtar (“Iskandar”) alighted from a Grab private vehicle along Lorong 20 Geylang to meet with his friends. While Francis were trying to sell keychains some members of public at the roadside, Iskandar left his group of friends and approached Francis and Ah Seng. Iskandar spoke in Malay to Francis in a rude manner. Iskandar then tried to provoke Francis by asking why he was staring at him, before leaving. Provoked by Iskandar’s words and behaviour, Francis walked towards Iskandar. They confronted each other in the middle of the alley, and Francis started to behave aggressively towards Iskandar. Having witnessed this from afar, Ah Seng rushed in to break up the confrontation between Francis and Iskandar. However, Ah Seng’s efforts were futile. The confrontation between Francis and Iskandar spilled onto Geylang Road, where Francis, Iskandar and Ah Seng fought. The altercation lasted for about a minute before all parties returned to Lorong 20 Geylang separately. Francis and Ah Seng left Lorong 20 Geylang shortly after, walking along the roadside footpath of Geylang Road.

> Meanwhile, Iskandar entered one of coffeeshops on Lorong 20 Geylang, where he met the accused, and informed him of the altercation. They decided to find Francis and Ah Seng and assault them. The accused and Iskandar started to walk towards the direction in which Francis and Ah Seng had left Lorong 20 Geylang.

> At or around 9:25pm, the accused caught up with Ah Seng, who was walking along Dong Bei Jiao Xi Wang Restaurant located at 372 Geylang Road, Singapore. Ah Seng was caught unaware by the accused, who had approached Ah Seng from behind. The accused unleashed a flurry of punches on Ah Seng’s head and body, causing Ah Seng to lose his balance and fall onto the ground. While Ah Seng was on the ground, the accused bent down to direct multiple punches with both of his hands at Ah Seng’s face. The accused then started to deal multiple sharp kicks with his right foot to the right side of Ah Seng’s face, and thereafter stomped Ah Seng’s face with his right foot multiple times.

> Ah Seng was knocked unconscious as a result of the accused’s actions, and was subsequently conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital via ambulance, where he was admitted for 3 days from 12 August 2021 to 14 August 2021. A medical report dated 30 August 2021 regarding his admission found that Ah Seng suffered acute displaced fractures of the inferomedial wall and floor of the right orbit, and right nasal bone. There was also an inferior herniation of orbital fat and inferior rectus muscle. A subsequent medical report dated 31 August 2021 indicated that Ah Seng’s extra-ocular movement was limited in the right eye on up-gaze. Ah Seng was recommended surgery, but opted against it.

> By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has voluntarily caused grievous hurt to Ah Seng, and has therefore committed an offence under section 325 of the Penal Code.

> The accused only stopped his assault on Ah Seng after he saw Francis approaching Ah Seng. He left Ah Seng unconscious on the footpath outside Dong Bei Jiao Xi Wang Restaurant, and chased down Francis together with Iskandar. He thereafter dealt some blows to Francis by punching and kicking him.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

5       The Prosecution submitted that the Accused is a recalcitrant and given the regularity of his criminal behaviour, a measured emphasis on specific deterrence must be factored into sentencing the Accused. To ensure his rehabilitation and reformation the learned DPP sought another Corrective Training sentence although the Accused had previously been subjected to one.

6       The Prosecution also highlighted that the likely sentence for the Accused in respect of the various charges would be a total sentence of four years and seven months’ imprisonment, with the following specific sentences for each of the charges:

> (a)     The 1st Charge: 18 months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     The 3rd Charge: 13 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane;

> (c)     The 4th Charge: Two years’ imprisonment.

7       The Prosecution further submitted that the totality principle should also not operate to reduce the accused’s aggregate sentence by running only two of the accused’s sentences consecutively, because the sentence of two years and 31 months’ imprisonment is proportionate to the accused’s overall criminality and consistent with the analytical framework set out by Menon CJ in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[81(j)\], where he held that it would be appropriate to impose more than two sentences consecutively where the accused is shown to be a persistent or habitual offender. Given the accused’s antecedents, the learned DPP submitted that it would be appropriate to do so in the present case.

8       Adopting the two-stage sentencing framework endorsed by the High Court in _Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ \[2016\] 4 SLR 936 (“_Sim Yeow Kee_”), the Prosecution submitted that CT is a viable sentencing option for the Accused in this case.

## Mitigation

9       The Accused stated in his mitigation that he should be given a shorter sentence and be allowed to return to his new family. He further stated that he is an orphan who committed offences but now hopes to get married to his fiancé soon and will stay away from crime. He insisted that this would be the last occasion he would commit any offence and come to court. He said he was remorseful and repents what he had done. Interestingly, he also questioned if CT would work for him as it did not the last time he was given such a sentence.

## Sentencing Decision

10     The main issue that this court had to address in the present case was whether a sentence of CT ought to be imposed (as opposed to regular imprisonment), and if so, what would be the appropriate length of CT. The length of CT that the court can impose in lieu of a sentence of imprisonment is a period of between five and 14 years.

11     A three-judge bench of the High Court in _Sim Yeow Kee_, held that there is no longer any qualitative difference between the rehabilitative programmes offered to CT inmates and those offered to regular prison inmates. However, a quantitative difference remains between the two forms of incarceration in that (a) the minimum statutorily-prescribed term of CT is a period of five years and (b) while almost all regular prison inmates would qualify for remission under the Conditional Remission System, only about a quarter of CT inmates would qualify for ROL which is a discretionary scheme: _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[82\] – \[83\].

12     When considering the suitability of an offender for CT on the facts of a particular case, the analytical framework in _Sim Yeow Kee_ is most elucidating. Preliminarily, the court needs to consider whether the offender satisfies the technical requirements under the s 304(1) CPC for CT to be imposed. If this requirement is satisfied, the court then considers whether it is “expedient with a view to \[the offender’s\] reformation and the prevention of crime” that the offender be sentenced to CT through a three-step framework. The question for the court at this stage is whether the interests of specific deterrence and reformation, being the operative justification for a sentence CT, warrant the imposition of CT: _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[98\].

### Stage 1:   Whether the Accused satisfies the technical requirements for CT to be imposed

13     The Accused clearly satisfies the requirements of Stage 1 of the _Sim Yeow Kee_ framework, as the legal requirements of CT prescribed under s 304(1) CPC are satisfied:

> (a)     The accused is above the age of 18 years;

> (b)     The accused’s present convictions are before the District Court;

> (c)     The charges on which he has been convicted in this Court are punishable with imprisonment for more than 2 years; and

> (d)     As seen in his antecedents highlighted above, the accused has been convicted in Singapore since he reached the age of 16 multiple times for offences punishable with imprisonment for more than 2 years, and he was sentenced to imprisonment and CT for those convictions.

### Stage 2:   Whether it is expedient to sentence the Accused to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime

14     At the second stage of the _Sim Yeow Kee_ framework, it is necessary for me to consider the following three-step process:

> Step 1: What is the imprisonment term that would likely be imposed on the offender for the underlying offence?

> Step 2: Would the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”) apply to the offender if he were sentenced to regular imprisonment?

> Step 3: Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate?

#### Step 1:   Likely imprisonment term to be imposed on the Accused for the underlying offences

##### (a)    S 380 PC r/w s 34 PC (“the 1st Charge”)

15     The prosecution submitted that the likely sentence for the accused for this charge should be 18 months’ imprisonment. However, after reviewing the precedents cited by the Prosecution, I was of the view that the various aggravating factors in this case coupled with his previous property offences, clearly warranted a sentence of at least 24 months’ imprisonment.

16     In 2005, whilst placed on probation for three counts of theft under section 379 PC, he breached the terms of the probation order by committing two further theft offences and was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 in July 2006. The Accused was hardly deterred and went on to commit another spree of five counts of theft offences for which he was placed on Reformative Training in February 2007. It appears that the accused was not discouraged to turn away from his criminal ways and mend his path. He progressed to more serious property related offences. In November 2009, he was sentenced to three years and three months’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane for one count of robbery under section 392 PC, three counts of theft under section 379 PC together with charges of criminal trespass as well as being armed with an instrument for use in connection with housebreaking.

17     There are also multiple aggravating factors in the present theft charge. The offence was premeditated and well planned with his accomplice, one Ridzwan. The value of the gold bracelet at $3,140 was also significant. Accordingly, I was of the view that a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment is the most appropriate punishment.

##### (b)    S 28(2) r/w s 28(1)(b) p/u s 28(2)(a) r/w s 28(3)(b)(i) MLA (“the 3rd Charge”)

18     Parliament’s approach towards loan shark offences is clear – it has prescribed mandatory imprisonment and caning for even first-time offenders. Hence, in the light of the severity of the mandatory sentences, Parliament’s intention is evident to strongly deter the commission of loan shark offences: _Ong Chee Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> (“_Ong Chee Eng_”) at \[10\].

19     Chong J. in _PP v Nelson Jeyaraj s/o Chandran_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1130</span> (“_Nelson Jeyaraj_”) held at \[47\] that the benchmark sentence for non-fire harassment cases with property damage should be 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane and endorsed the earlier decisions where it had been applied: see _Public Prosecutor v Wu Wei Chun_ DAC 31830/2010 and _Public Prosecutor v Kau Wui Keong_ DAC 19918/2010. This approach gives effect to Parliament’s intent to take an even stronger stance on such offences.

20     It is quite clear that based on precedent the starting point for non-fire harassment case is 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

21     It then behoves the court to look at aggravating or mitigating factors in the case. In this case however, there are only strong aggravating factors that militate against any discount from the benchmark sentence.

#### Aggravating factor when innocent persons are harassed

22     The Accused brought along with him a can of orange spray paint, the debtor note which he prepared beforehand, masking tape, and a hoodie and cap which he intended to wear to prevent detection and identification by the police.

23     Although he had the hoodie and cap on he realised that there were multiple CCTV cameras installed outside Unit #XXX that would lead to his identification. To avoid detection, he spray-painted the CCTV cameras with orange paint. He then proceeded to spray paint “O$P$” repeatedly on both the main doors of Unit #XXX and Unit #XXX, as well as on the walls surrounding the main doors. He thereafter pasted the debtor note on the main door of Unit #XXX using masking tape.

24     The occupant of Unit #XXX was alarmed by what she saw and at being targeted. She and her family members had never borrowed money from unlicensed moneylenders, and believed that her unit was targeted because of her neighbour living in Unit #XXX.

25     These facts show that the Accused clearly intended to cause alarm to innocent third parties. Tay J. in _Public Prosecutor v Quek Li Hao_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 471</span>, (_“Quek Li Hao”_), at \[39\] highlighted such aggravating factors:

> In my view, it is an aggravating factor when **_innocent persons are deliberately targeted and harassed_**. This could take the form of harassing the debtor’s neighbours or vandalising the flat when the harasser knows that the debtor is no longer residing there. Innocent parties should not be made to suffer the anxiety, frustration and helplessness caused by such acts of harassment. Such indiscriminate acts disturb the peace of mind and sense of well-being of the community by enlarging the area of conflict. (emphasis added)

26     The accused with deliberate knowledge that it was not the debtor’s unit, harassed the debtor’s neighbour by splashing paint on the neighbour’s unit.

27     Tay J. had most pertinently observed at \[44\] that:

> In my view, offenders **_who knowingly harass innocent persons such as debtors’ neighbours ought to be given an imprisonment term of two to three months higher than the benchmark sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment_**. Unlicensed moneylenders and their assistants should not be allowed to treat debtors’ neighbours as mere collateral damage in their unrelenting quest to make debtors pay up. Similarly, offenders in the “greed and self-interest” category could justifiably be given enhanced sentences of three to six months above the said benchmark, with due consideration accorded to their youthfulness and other relevant factors. (emphasis added)

28     Although I was prepared to accept that the facts disclosed that he was in the “genuine financial need” category of offenders for this type of offences, and not in the “greed and self-interest” category, I could not however find any other mitigating circumstances to not consider a suitable uplift from the benchmark sentence of 12 months. The clear direction of Tay J. is that there should be an uplift of two to three months’ imprisonment from the benchmark. I was accordingly of the view that in the circumstances of the offence there should be an uplift of two months’ imprisonment to arrive at a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

##### (c)    S 325 PC (“the 4th Charge”)

29     In assessing sentencing for the accused under the 4th Charge, I had regard to the two-step sentencing framework in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (_“PP v BDB”_) at \[55(a)-(b)\]:

> 55    In the light of the above review of the precedents, we turn to the sentencing approach to be taken in cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code. The primary sentencing objective in such cases is likely to be deterrence. Further, retribution may also be relevant as a sentencing consideration where heinous violence has been inflicted. In our judgment, we think that sentencing in such cases should be approached in a two-step process as follows:

>> (a)    First, because the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.

>> (b)    Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors

30     Under the first step of the _BDB_ framework, the harm caused to the victim involved multiple facial fractures, (acute displaced fractures of the inferomedial wall and floor or the right orbit, and right nasal bone) for which treatment in the form of surgery was recommended. The vicious assault by the Accused had also rendered the defenceless victim unconscious.

31     I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that for the degree of harm caused, based on precedents, the starting point should be a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment. This then leads to the second step of the inquiry to consider the aggravating factors in the case.

32     This was clearly a premeditated attack on the victim, which is an aggravating factor, per _BDB_ at \[63\]. The Accused had deliberately ambushed the victim and inflicted the injuries.

33     The manner of attack and his desire to seek vengeance for an earlier fight that had taken place between his friend and the victim, amply demonstrates the Accused’s propensity towards violence and causing brutal harm. The facts disclose that he was not just contend on assaulting the victim but also rushed to assault the victim’s friend too.

34     His present criminal conduct is consistent with his past offences involving violence, particularly his conviction for robbery under section 392 Penal Code. I accordingly agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that there should be a substantial uplift from the starting point of 18 months’ imprisonment. I determined that a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence for this offence.

#### Step 2:   Whether the MAS would apply to the Accused if sentenced to regular imprisonment

35     The Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”) is a structured aftercare regime which provides enhanced community support, counselling and case management, as well as tighter supervision for ex-inmates who are at higher risk of re-offending or who need more support in integration. The Accused would in fact be eligible for MAS should he be released on remission for a regular term of imprisonment. In fulfilment of the requirements listed in s 50U of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (“PA”):

> (a)     The Accused has committed offences under the First Schedule to the Prisons Act, to wit, 1 count of s 325 PC and 1 count of s 380 PC;

> (b)     The Accused’s likely sentence for the offences, aggregated with any other consecutive term of imprisonment to which he was sentenced, is longer than the minimum sentence which is prescribed in the First Schedule in relation to the offences (i.e. 1 year for s 325 PC, and 1 year for s 380 PC);

> (c)     The Accused has relevant antecedents (i.e. a drug-related antecedent) for the offence which were prescribed in the First Schedule in relation to the offence (i.e. s 380 PC) at the time the offence was committed; and

> (d)     The Accused is not subject to an order removing him from Singapore under the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed).

36     On the basis that the Accused is released after serving two-thirds of a 62-month imprisonment term, the Accused would be eligible for about 21 months of mandatory aftercare pursuant to the MAS.

37     In this regard, I was also aware of the reminder from the High Court in _Sim Yeow Kee_, to consider the rehabilitative benefits of the MAS being made available to potential CT inmates if they were sentenced instead to regular imprisonment. However, this factor may bear little weight where a longer term of CT is called for, since the alternative would be a correspondingly long term of regular imprisonment. The emphasis for such cases would be on crime prevention to a greater degree: _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[17(d) – (e)\]. In the present case however, the fact that the MAS would be available to the Accused did not afford a strong enough reason to impose regular imprisonment. A term of CT would not only satisfy the reformative aspect of sentencing, but also achieve the prevention of crime to a significant degree as necessitated by the seriousness of the Accused’s criminal behaviour and his flagrant disregard of the law.

#### Step 3:   Whether a sentence of CT would be unduly disproportionate

38     The calibration of a CT sentence should be subject to the principle of proportionality. However, proportionality in this context applies to an attenuated extent in the form of a negating consideration which would justify not imposing CT if the statutorily-prescribed minimum term of CT (i.e. five years) would result in a period of incarceration that is seriously or unduly disproportionate to the aggregate imprisonment term which would likely to have been imposed: _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[105\]. The High Court explained that this would typically involve cases where the minimum term of CT is “substantially in excess of the likely imprisonment term for the underlying offence”. On the facts of the present case, the consideration of proportionality does not militate against the imposition of CT due to the length of term of imprisonment that the Accused would otherwise been sentenced to.

39     Applying the clear guidance from Menon CJ in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[81(j)\], it would be appropriate to impose more than two sentences consecutively where the accused is shown to be a persistent or habitual offender. I was accordingly of the view that it would be appropriate to do so in the present case, given the Accused’s antecedents as well as it being a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved. This would have result in the Accused serving a regular imprisonment term of 62 months.

40     The High Court in _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[83\] recognised the fact that remission is available to almost all inmates serving a term of regular imprisonment, whereas only about a quarter of CT inmates will qualify for ROL which remains a discretionary scheme. CT inmates who are assessed as continuing to pose a risk to society and being in need of further rehabilitation are not granted ROL: _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[41\]. In this regard, I fully agree with the learned DPP’s submission that the CT regime would be more appropriate in ensuring that the Accused is sufficiently reformed before he is released back into society. This is particularly apposite since the CT report has unmistakably indicated the Accused to be of a high risk of both general and violent reoffending with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release.

41     The Risk Findings in the CT Report are as follows:

> **Risk Findings**

> _General Risk of Criminal Recidivism_

> Based on Singapore's norms, Azmil's LS/CMI score places him in the **High Risk/Need** level of general criminal re-offending. He belongs to a group of prisoners with a **70.2% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release.**

> _Specific Risk of General Violence Reoffending_

> Based on the HCR-20V3, Azmil's risk of general violence re-offending is assessed to be in the Moderate range. Azmil's violence reoffending is closely related to his drug abuse, which was his impetus to commit instrumental violence (e.g., robbery) for fast monetary rewards. In addition, his drug abuse, including abusing prescription drugs, had disinhibited his self-control and cognitive functioning, and elevated his propensity to commit violence without consequential thinking. It is assessed that Azmil's violent behaviour was also perpetuated by the presence of antisocial attitudes and affiliation with antisocial friends.

42     The learned DPP submitted that the most significant risk factor for the Accused appears to be his insistence on associating and socialising with negative peers. I agree. His association with negative peers has been a significant risk factor to both his past and current offending behaviour. He has committed violence and property-related crimes in concert with antisocial peers, and was also introduced to drugs by his antisocial peers.

43     The CT report pointed out that despite his five-year CT sentence that he served between 2014 and 2019 for his property and drug offences, shortly after his release, he was again incarcerated for committing property offences. The CT report further made a germane observation that this is indeed a troubling trend that the Accused would only enjoy brief moments in the community between periods of incarceration, ranging from one week to eight months. The Accused has therefore demonstrated that he remains undeterred by past convictions and sentences, refusing to stay away from the factors which encouraged his reoffending conduct.

44     Basing his argument on the escalation principle, the learned DPP submitted that the minimum term of 5 years CT should be enhanced to one of 6 years CT.

45     Taking into account my earlier assessment of the Accused’s regular sentence of 62 months and three strokes of the cane, which would be a five years and two months’ term, a term of five years and six months Corrective Training would be appropriate in all the circumstances of this case. This length of CT will not be unduly disproportionate to his likely imprisonment sentence and will not be crushing with regards to his prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration.

## Conclusion

46     Ultimately, I found that the need for specific deterrence of a recalcitrant offender and affording him another attempt at rehabilitation and reformation before being released to society to be paramount considerations for my decision to impose five years and six months CT and three strokes of the cane.
