Criminal Law – Offences – Dangerous driving

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9603/2020/01.\]

4 August 2020

### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

1       The Accused claimed trial to a single charge of dangerous driving under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev. Ed.) (“**RTA**”):

> You… are charged that you, on 11th September 2018 at about 08.42 am, along East Coast Parkway towards direction of Changi Airport, Singapore, did drive motorcar bearing the vehicle registration number **SLZ570S**, in a manner which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, to wit, by swerving abruptly to from (_sic_) the center lane and resulted in a collision onto FBF3266A which was travelling on your left and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 276, 2004 Revised Edition).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him.

3       Having heard the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the mitigation plea put forth by counsel for the accused, I imposed on the accused a fine of $3,000 and a disqualification period of 10 months for all classes of driving licences.

4       The accused has since paid up his fine. Counsel also confirmed that the accused was not applying for a stay of the disqualification period. As such, the disqualification period took effect from the date of sentencing i.e. 3 July 2020.

5       The Accused has now appealed against both his conviction and sentence.

## Background Facts

### Undisputed Facts

6       On 11 September 2018 at about 8.42 a.m., an accident occurred along the East Coast Parkway (“ECP”) towards the direction of Changi Airport, between a vehicle driven by the accused (SLZ 570S) and a motorcycle driven by PW1 Akram Bin Abdul Malek (“the victim”) (FBF 3266A).[^1] As a result of the accident, the victim suffered from a right ankle avulsion fracture with left abdominal wall abrasion. He also suffered a vertical fracture of the tip of the terminal phalanx of his third finger. He was given medical leave from 11 to 24 September 2018.[^2]

7       Prior to the accident, the victim worked as a technician at Mapletree Industrial Trust. His job involved carrying heavy loads and climbing up ladders. After the accident, the victim went back to work on 1 December 2019, but could only be given light duties. This was the case even when the victim testified on 1 October 2019.[^3]

8       As a result of the accident, the victim’s motorcycle sustained damages, mostly to its left side. The left side mirrors were cracked and the left gear levers dented. There were scratches on the left side of the box and the front headlight was crumpled.[^4]

9       The damage to the accused’s vehicle was only at the left side mirror, which was cracked.[^5]

### Issue in Dispute

10     The main issue in dispute was the question of who had caused the accident.

11     In particular, the Prosecution’s case was that the accident was caused by the accused who had swerved abruptly left from his lane, thereby colliding into the victim who was travelling on the left side of the accused’s vehicle at that point.

12     The accused, on the other hand, contended that it was the victim who was straddling lanes when trying to overtake him, and collided into the left side mirror of the accused’s vehicle in the process.

## The Prosecution’s Case

13     The Prosecution adduced evidence of the accident from the victim and two eye witnesses. Video footages from the eye witnesses’ vehicles were also retrieved and tendered as evidence.

14     The victim gave evidence that at the material time, he was riding to work at Changi Business Park. Just before the accident, he was riding on the centre lane (lane 2) of the three lane expressway. The accused’s vehicle was in front of him and in lane 2 as well. He saw the accused’s vehicle try to change lane to the left. He therefore slowed down. When he saw that the accused’s vehicle had failed to change lane due to another vehicle being on the left lane, the victim then picked up speed and tried to overtake the accused’s vehicle from the left. As he was trying to do so, the collision occurred.

15     PW4 Joshua Lim Sheng Wei (“PW4 Joshua”) was driving behind the accused at the material time. Video footage from his in-car camera unit was extracted and admitted in evidence as “Witness 2 Footage”.[^6] From the video footage, the accused’s vehicle can be seen drifting left at one point in what appeared to be an attempt to switch to the left lane. However, the accused braked and moved back into the centre of lane 2, presumably because he saw that there was another vehicle on the left lane. At this point, the victim’s motorcycle can then be seen coming from PW4 Joshua’s left. The victim slowed down a little as he came behind the accused’s vehicle, and then sped up together with the vehicle on the left lane, presumably in an attempt to overtake the accused. However, just as he went beside the accused, the accused’s vehicle swerved left again and collided into the victim. Throughout this time, the accused did not signal left.

16     PW4 Joshua also gave evidence that he saw the accused’s vehicle make an abrupt swerve to the left, and collided into the victim. He did not agree with counsel’s suggestion that the victim had been the one who collided into the accused’s vehicle.[^7]

17     PW2 Christopher Michael Roland Ad Poczka (“PW2 Christopher”) was driving behind PW4 Joshua at the material time. Video footage from his in-car camera unit was extracted and admitted in evidence as “Witness 1 Footage A” and “Witness 1 Footage B”. The relevant portions on how the accident occurred can be found in “Witness 1 Footage A”. The video footage captured from PW2 Christopher’s vehicle camera was broadly similar to what could be seen from “Witness 2 Footage”, except at a greater distance. The accused’s vehicle could still be seen in what appeared to be two attempts at switching to the left lane, the second attempt of which resulted in a collision with the victim.

18     In submissions, the Prosecution argued that the accused had attempted to change lanes without conducting the requisite checks on his side mirror, rear view mirror and blind spot. The Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) also pointed out that the accused had not signalled on both occasions when he was attempting to filter left. By swerving abruptly without conducting the necessary checks, the accused had driven in a manner which was dangerous to the public, resulting in his vehicle colliding with the victim’s motorcycle.

## The Defence Case

19     The accused admitted that he had indeed tried to switch lanes to the left twice, and it was on the second occasion that the accident occurred. He gave evidence that on the first occasion, he had checked his rear view mirror and side mirror before noticing another black vehicle on his left, which caused him to move back to his lane.

20     On the second occasion, the accused’s evidence was that before he could even look at his side mirror, the collision happened and he had no time to react. He admitted that he did not signal as he was still waiting for the vehicle on the left to pass before he did so. The accused maintained that he did not see the victim’s motorcycle as it was too fast.

21     Just before the accident, the accused was travelling at about 30 or 40 km/h.

22     In submissions, the Defence maintained that it was the victim who had collided into the accused, and not vice versa. The victim had been speeding and straddling lanes and though the accused had kept a proper lookout at all times, he did not and could not have seen the victim because the victim was riding too fast and straddling lanes. In addition, the victim ought to have tried to overtake the accused from the right instead of from the left. The Defence also argued that the accused was within his lane (lane 2) at all times, and he had not swerved abruptly. The accused’s vehicle was gradually beginning to move towards the left when the accident occurred.

## Issue 1: Did the accused collide into the victim?

23     Having reviewed the evidence, and in particular the video footages of the accident, I was satisfied that it was the accused who collided into the victim. The victim had been travelling in a straight line. If not for the fact that the accused’s vehicle had swerved to the left, there would have been no accident.

24     The accused also agreed in cross examination that his vehicle had moved to the left at the time of the accident.[^8]

25     It was therefore clear to me that it was the accused who had collided into the victim, and not vice versa.

## Issue 2: Did the accused’s actions constitute dangerous driving?

26     Section 64(1) of the RTA is set out below:

> **_If any person drives a motor vehicle_** _on a road recklessly, or at a speed or_ **_in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road_** _, he shall be guilty of an offence…(_Emphasis added.)

27     There was no dispute between parties that the test for whether an offender had driven dangerously is an objective one and a question of fact to be determined by the court. See _Lim Hong Eng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 682</span> at \[3\]. This would generally require some dangerous act or manoeuvre on the part of the driver. See _Lim Chin Poh v Public Prosecutor_ \[1968-1970\] SLR(R) 483 at \[10\].

28     The charge brought against the accused stated that he had driven dangerously by swerving abruptly from the centre lane, resulting in a collision with the victim’s motorcycle.

29     The Defence argued that there was no abrupt swerve, and that instead the accused was gradually beginning to move to the left when the accident occurred. I disagreed. From the video evidence, I found that the accused had in fact swerved abruptly to the left. That was also the impression given to PW4 Joshua Lim who was an important eye witness as he was directly behind the accused at the time of the accident. The fact that the accused had largely remained in Lane 2 did not change this. Factually, I did not see why one could not swerve abruptly within one’s lane.

30     The next question was whether this abrupt swerve constituted dangerous driving, having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic at that time.

31     I noted that the accident occurred on an expressway, where one would expect the speeds of vehicles to be quite fast. This generally means that the effect of any abrupt shifts in speed or direction will be amplified and felt very keenly by the surrounding vehicles, as everyone’s reaction time is reduced. In fact, it would probably be fair to say that the reaction time for drivers on a fast-moving expressway would be in the milliseconds.

32     Another consequence of the high speeds on an expressway is that there is greater personal danger to everyone on the road should something go wrong.

33     I did not agree that as long as the accused kept within his lane, his driving could not be considered dangerous. This would depend on the type of movement he makes within his lane. If it was a gradual drift, this may not pose too much of a concern for the surrounding vehicles. However, if it was an abrupt swerve, this would almost certainly impact on the surrounding vehicles, especially on a fast moving road like the ECP. Even the smallest defensive action taken by a fast moving vehicle on an expressway could result in drastic consequences.

34     I note that in this case, the accused was attempting to shift lanes. In fact, it was on his second attempt that he collided into the victim. He did not signal, and I was also satisfied that he did not complete all the necessary checks before moving the vehicle. I agreed with the Prosecution that if he had made all the necessary checks, he would have seen the victim. The victim was not travelling so fast that it would have been impossible to spot him. This is clear from the video footage.

35     Given that the accused had made an abrupt swerve while driving on an expressway, without conducting the necessary checks or signalling, I was satisfied that his actions amounted to having driven in a manner which was dangerous to the public.

36     For completeness, I should also state that I did not put much weight on the victim’s speed and manner of driving _before_ the accident. The footage from “Witness 1 Footage A” showed a stretch of time about a minute before the accident occurred, when the victim’s motorcycle could be seen overtaking several vehicles on the expressway, and even straddling lanes and going between two vehicles at some point. I did not find this portion of the evidence particularly relevant, as it did not directly shed light on the victim’s manner of driving during the accident itself. I would also note that the victim’s speed during this one minute stretch was not indicative of his speed just before the accident. From the video footage, it could be seen that everyone generally slowed down towards the point of accident, which was near an exit.

37     At the time of the accident, the victim did appear to be straddling the left and centre lanes when trying to overtake the accused’s vehicle. I agreed that he should not have done this, but there is no principle of contributory negligence as a defence in criminal proceedings. The fact remains that the accused had objectively driven in a manner which was dangerous to the public, and it was this dangerous driving which had caused the collision with the victim.

## Conviction

38     I was therefore satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and convicted him accordingly.

## Sentence

### Antecedents

39     The accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s submission on sentence

40     The Prosecution sought a fine of at least $3,500 and a disqualification period of at least 10 months.

41     The Prosecution characterised the harm in this case as serious, given the fractures suffered by the victim, and the accused’s culpability as low.

42     The Prosecution also relied on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Sim Eng Hwa_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 26</span> (“_Sim Eng Hwa_”), where the offender had driven a lorry along Telok Ayer Road towards the Marine Coast Expressway (“MCE”). At the material time, there was a motorcycle travelling on the adjacent lane on the right side of the lorry. The offender made an abrupt lane change to the right, without turning on his signal indicator, thereby encroaching into the path of the motorcycle, which was travelling straight. The rider of the motorcycle managed to narrowly avoid a collision by swerving right. No injuries were suffered. The offender was fined $1,800 and disqualified from driving for all classes of driving licences for a period of nine months.

43     As there were injuries suffered in the present case, the DPP submitted that an uplift from the sentence in _Sim Eng Hwa_ was warranted.

### Mitigation

44     The Defence sought a fine of between $2,400 and $3,000, and a disqualification order of between four to six months.

45     The Defence agreed with the general characterisation of the offence as serious harm and low culpability, although counsel pointed out that there was no surgical intervention required in the present case and the harm should therefore be pegged towards the lower end of the “serious harm” category.

46     Instead of _Sim Eng Hwa_, the Defence referred me to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Michael Wong Yew Wah_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 73</span> (“_Michael Wong_”). The offender in that case had collided into a pedestrian at a signalised crossing when the offender was executing a right turn in his taxi. The victim sustained a closed displaced fracture of lateral tibial plateau of the left knee and abrasion of her left knee. The offender was sentenced to a fine of $2,400 and a disqualification period of six months. Counsel pointed out that this case also involved an offender who claimed trial, and where the victim had suffered serious injuries, although he also conceded that the maximum fine amount under s 64(1) of the RTA then was $3,000, as opposed to the maximum fine of $5,000 in the present case.

47     Counsel also highlighted that his client had offered compensation to the victim, but the victim had not been willing to accept it.

### Court’s decision on sentence

48     I agreed that this was a case involving serious harm and low culpability. I also accepted counsel’s point that the harm in this case should be pegged towards the lower range of the “serious harm” category.

49     I took the view that the case of _Sim Eng Hwa_ was instructive rather than _Michael Wong_, as it similarly involved an accident resulting from a failure to conduct necessary checks before making an abrupt change of lane. Taking into account the serious injuries caused in the present case, as well as the fact that the accused had claimed trial (as opposed to the offender in _Sim Eng Hwa_ who pleaded guilty), I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift from the sentence in _Sim Eng Hwa_ was appropriate.

50     All things considered, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $3,000 in default one week’s imprisonment, and a disqualification for all classes of driving licences for a period of 10 months. After confirming with counsel that the accused was not requesting for a stay of execution of the disqualification order, I ordered the disqualification to commence from 3 July 2020. The accused has also since paid up the fine.
