### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

## Introduction

1       The accused faced a total of 17 charges, resulting from three separate arrests. Two of the arrests took place when he was on station bail and court bail respectively. All the charges were drug-related. He pleaded guilty before me to the following six charges:

2       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification, and was found guilty and convicted. He further admitted to and consented for the remaining 11 charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After hearing the parties on sentencing and mitigation, I imposed the minimum sentence for each proceeded charge, and ordered the sentences for three of the charges (1st, 5th and 6th charges) to run consecutively. The result is a **global sentence of 11 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane**. The sentence was backdated to 28 June 2018, the date when the accused was remanded after his third arrest.

4       The accused is appealing against this sentence.

## Statement of Facts

5       The salient portions in the Statement of Facts are set out below:

##### 8 November 2017 (1st and 2nd charges)

6       On 8 November 2017, the accused was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”) in the vicinity of Block 421 Bedok North Road, Singapore. CNB officers led the accused to his company car bearing registration number SJT 5997S which was parked at the car park of Block 421 Bedok North Road. A search of the car was conducted.

7       Various items and drugs were seized, including exhibits marked “D1A1A1” and “D1A1B1”, which form the subject matter for the 1st and 2nd charges respectively. The other exhibits seized form the subject matter for other charges taken into consideration.

8       On the same day, CNB officers also conducted a search of the accused’s unit at Block 673 Edgefield Plains, #XXX, Singapore, and seized other items. Items which were seized on this day included glass smoking apparatus, tubes, a digital weighing scale and numerous empty packets.

9       Exhibit D1A1A1 was found to be three packets containing not less than 2.78g of a crystalline substance, analysed and found to contain not less than 1.96g of _ketamine_.

10     Exhibit D1A1B1 was found to be five blue tablets weighing not less than 1.44g, analysed and found to contain not less than 0.54g of MDMA.

11     The accused admitted ownership to exhibits D1A1A1 and D1A1B1, and stated that they were for his own consumption.

12     Both MDMA and _ketamine_ are Class A controlled drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

##### 20 June 2018 (6th charge)

13     On 20 June 2018, while the accused was out on station bail, he was arrested by officers from the CNB in front of a vehicle bearing registration number SLX 9237G, which was parked at deck 2B of the multi-storey car park of Block 672 Edgefield Plains, Singapore.

14     Several items and drugs were seized from the accused, which form the subject matter for charges taken into consideration.

15     On the same day, the accused provided two bottles of urine samples, which were analysed and found to contain _methamphetamine_, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

16     The accused admitted that he had consumed _methamphetamine_ prior to his arrest. He had relapsed to consuming _methamphetamine_ a few weeks prior to his arrest, and he would consume it about two to three times a week.

##### 27 June 2018 (3rd, 4th and 5th charges)

17     On 27 June 2018 at about 2.05 a.m., while the accused was out on court bail, he was arrested by police officers when he was found sleeping in a vehicle bearing registration number SLX 9237G at the car park of Block 147 Bishan Street 11, Singapore. A search of the vehicle was conducted.

18     Various items and drugs were seized, including exhibits marked “C” and “D”, which form the subject matter for the 4th and 5th charges respectively. The other exhibits seized form the subject matter for other charges taken into consideration.

19     Exhibit C was found to be one tablet analysed and found to contain _nimetazepam_.

20     Exhibit D was found to be seven packets containing not less than 28.63g of a crystalline substance, analysed and found to contain not less than 19.34g of _methamphetamine_.

21     The accused admitted ownership to exhibits C and D, and stated that they were for his own consumption.

22     On the same day, the accused provided two bottles of urine samples, which were analysed and found to contain _nimetazepam_, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

23     The accused admitted to consuming Erimin-5 tablets (i.e. _nimetazepam_) prior to his arrest. He would consume _nimetazepam_ about once or twice a week.

24     Prior to the commission of these offences, the accused had been convicted on 1 December 2009 for an offence of possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the MDA (_methamphetamine_), and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside. On the same occasion, he had also been convicted on for an offence of LT1 consumption of a specified drug (_methamphetamine_) under s 8(b)(ii) r/w s 33A(1) of the MDA, and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside.

## Mitigation

26     In mitigation, counsel for the accused emphasized that his client had genuinely intended to turn over a new leaf after being released from prison in 2016. He obtained gainful employment as a car salesman and also sought to upgrade himself with part-time diploma studies. He completed all his urine supervision tests and was preparing to settle down with his fiancé.

27     Unfortunately, he ran into financial difficulties when his fiancé got into some trouble with the law and needed a lawyer. In addition, his fiancé also suffered from a miscarriage, and that was a major setback for the accused. Unable to cope with the stress and depression that followed, he turned to drugs again.

28     Letters from the accused’s family members, and the accused himself were also tendered in mitigation, reiterating the same points as above. The accused stated that his fiancé had in fact suffered two miscarriages, the second one upon his “release from bail”. Together with the new charges he was facing, the accused felt that a career and education for him was “impossible” and hence “fell deeper into addiction of drugs”.

29     Counsel for the accused asked for minimum sentences for all the charges, and for only two charges (one charge for LT2 drug consumption and one charge for enhanced drug possession) to run consecutively, making a global sentence of nine years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

## Prosecution’s sentencing submissions

30     The Prosecution was largely in agreement with the sentence requested for by the accused. Having pointed out that the aggravating factors in this case included the fact that there had been three separate arrests, the accused had committed a string of offences while on bail, and that the accused had previously been sentenced to 10 years and nine strokes of the cane in 2009, the Prosecution noted that the accused would be facing a minimum global term of nine years and 12 strokes of the cane even if only two charges were to run consecutively, and that this would be sufficient.

31     When I queried further on this position, the Prosecution then informed me that they had taken into account the fact that the accused had spent some time in remand even prior to 28 June 2018. The accused was first remanded on 9 November 2017 following his first arrest, and released only in April 2018 when his offences were delisted and hence became bailable.

## My decision

32     The proceeded charges were either that for enhanced drug possession under s 8(a) r/w s 33(1) of the MDA (“**enhanced possession**”), or for LT2 drug consumption under s 8(b)(ii) r/w s 33A(2) of the MDA (“**LT2**”).

33     The charge of enhanced possession is punishable with a term of not less than two years and not more than 10 years’ imprisonment, and the offender is also liable to a fine of $20,000.

34     The charge of LT2 is punishable with a term of not less than 7 years and not more than 13 years’ imprisonment, and caning of not less than six strokes and not more than 12 strokes.

35     After having considered the facts of the case as well as the submissions by both parties, I imposed the following sentences on the accused:

36     I ordered the sentences for the 1st, 5th and 6th charges to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 11 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

37     As I had imposed the mandatory minimum sentences for each individual charge, I assume that the accused’s objection to the sentence lies in the global term, and in particular the fact that I had ordered for three of the sentences to run consecutively instead of two.

38     In coming to my decision, I took into account the following:

> (a)     The six proceeded charges took place over the course of _three_ separate incidents and arrests;

> (b)     Two sets of offences had been committed while the accused was on station bail and court bail respectively and in fact, the third set of offences was committed only a week after the second set of offences;

> (c)     The accused had previously served a global term of 10 years’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane for drug related offences;

> (d)     He committed the first set of offences only about a year after his release from prison; and

> (e)     There were 11 remaining charges taken into consideration, including three enhanced possession charges and four LT2 charges. There were also multiple types of illegal drugs involved.

39     Having considered the above, I was of the view that it was both appropriate and necessary to run three of the sentences consecutively in order to properly reflect the extent of the accused’s criminality. Despite having been arrested in November 2017, the accused remained unrepentant and went on to commit more drug related offences on two further occasions. To only run two of the sentences consecutively would lead to the perverse and unjust outcome of the accused effectively not being punished for one of the occasions. I saw no reason to afford him such a discount. Such an approach also did not offend the _one-transaction rule_, since the three offences ordered to run consecutively took place on separate occasions and were unrelated to one another.

40     Furthermore, the accused had served a term of 10 years’ imprisonment for drug related offences in 2009, and had been released not long ago in 2016. I was of the view that imposing a sentence less than this term now would not serve to achieve the sentencing principle of deterrence, which has always been the main principle applicable to drug related offences. (See _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 63</span> at \[59\]) There was nothing so exceptional about the facts of the present case to displace this sentencing principle.

41     I considered the mitigating factors offered by the accused, but did not find any of them particularly significant. I appreciated the fact that the accused seemed to have made a genuine effort to reform upon his release in 2016, but as against all the other aggravating factors as listed in \[38\] above, I did not think any discount in sentence was warranted.

42     In fact, it would have been entirely appropriate to impose sentences higher than the mandatory minimum for the offences committed on bail. (See _PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[54 – 61\]) In deciding not to do so, I gave the accused some credit for the period of about six months he had spent in remand prior to 28 June 2018.

43     I was also mindful of the _totality principle_ when deciding on which of the charges to run consecutively and the global sentence to be imposed.

44     As I felt that running two LT2 sentences consecutively might be overly harsh, I decided to run two sentences for enhanced possession instead, together with one sentence for LT2.

45     The result is a global sentence of 11 years and 12 strokes of the cane. In view of the aggravating factors in this case, the accused’s past record and the number of charges involved, I was of the view that this sentence was not “substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved” and it did not have the effect of imposing on the accused “a crushing sentence not in keeping with his record and prospects”. (_See Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> at \[54\] and \[57\])

## Conclusion

46     In all the circumstances, I was of the view that imposing on the accused a global term of 11 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane was entirely appropriate and justified.
