Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

Professions – Medical profession and practice – Unregistered persons – Section 13 of the Medical Registration Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9014/2022/01.\]

28 February 2022

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 36-year-old female Singaporean, faced four charges for applying a local anaesthetic in the form of a numbing cream and administering fat melting injections on four of her customers when she was not registered as a medical practitioner and did not possess a valid practising certificate. The accused had operated a home-based beauty business under the Instagram account name of “seoulgood\_ka” by offering fat melting injections and Botox services since September 2020.

2       On 19 January 2022, the accused pleaded guilty to one of the charges for contravening s 13 of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2014 Rev Ed) (“MRA”) by doing an act as a medical practitioner when she was an unauthorised person, an offence punishable under s 17(1)(e) of the MRA. The accused admitted and consented to the remaining three charges to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing.

3       I imposed a sentence of 12 days’ imprisonment with effect from 19 January 2022.

4       On the same day, a Notice of Appeal was filed by the accused as she was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed on her. I therefore granted a stay of execution on the custodial sentence imposed pending the appeal and offered bail pending appeal at $10,000.

### Statement of facts

6       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated in January 2022 without qualification.

7       The accused has never been registered with the Singapore Medical Council ("SMC") and has never held a valid practicing certificate authorising her to carry out the practice of medicine.

8       In August 2019, she created an Instagram account under the name of "seoulgood\_ka". Sometime around September 2020, the accused began advertising fat melting injections and Botox services on the said Instagram account. She listed her contact number on the Instagram account so that potential customers could contact her. She also posted:

> (i)     information on the fat melting injection procedure;

> (ii)     the prices she charged for the fat melting injection procedure;

> (iii)     information on the Botox injections to the face and shoulder procedures; and

> (iv)     photographs of her doing preparation of the solutions to administer the various treatments in syringes.

9       The accused admitted that she had performed fat melting injections for about 30 customers and Botox injections for about 10 customers between September 2020 and February 2021 at her residential unit located at a block along Geylang East Avenue 1 (“Premises”).

#### First information report

10     On 16 December 2020, at about 11.06 am, the informant, Mrs Liew Boon Yee, an officer with the Health Products Regulation Group of the Health Sciences Authority ("HSA") notified the Ministry of Health ("MOH"), that HSA had received feedback from a member of the public that fat melting and Botox injections were being offered by one Instagram user "seoulgood\_ka". This person also operated a Carousell account under the handle "marielalisa".

#### Facts relation to DSC-900468-2021

11     On 6 February 2021, the victim, one Mok Yi Shan (a 28-year-old female Singaporean), came across the accused's Instagram account and saw that the accused was offering fat melting injections. The victim contacted the accused via Instagram and confirmed an appointment with the accused on the same day to undergo fat melting injections on the victim's arms, abdomen and waist at the Premises.

12     At about 11.30 am, the victim arrived at the Premises. The accused brought the victim to a bedroom located on the second floor of the unit. The accused informed the victim that she was a beautician. She also informed the victim about the possible side effects of the injections and that there might be some bruising on the injection areas.

13     The accused then asked the victim to complete and sign a consent form prepared by the accused, indicating that the victim understood that the treatment required many small injections around the area to be treated, acknowledged the possible risks of the treatment, gave her consent for the treatment and released the accused from all liabilities arising from performing the procedure and the facility where it was being carried out.

14     Thereafter, the accused asked the victim to lie down on a bed while the accused applied numbing cream to the victim's arms, abdomen and waist. Subsequently, the accused made about three to five injections on the right side of the victim's waist, followed by about five to 10 injections on the victim's abdomen, about three to five injections to the left side of the victim's waist, and about five to 10 injections on each of the victim's arms. The accused then applied some ice packs over the injection areas.

15     The victim paid the accused $864 by way of PayNow for the fat melting injections before leaving the Premises.

16     On 8 February 2021, at about 5.45 p.m., officers from MOH and HSA conducted a joint inspection at the Premises. The accused was found in possession of the following items:

#### Opinion of Dr Matthew Yeo

17     MOH sought the opinion of an independent medical expert on whether the accused's activities as set out above amounted to her doing acts as a medical practitioner. Dr Matthew Yeo, a registered plastic surgeon since 2012 and member as well as the current vice-chairperson of the Chapter of Plastic Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgeons, College of Surgeons Singapore provided his opinion. He was of the view that the accused had attempted to act as a medical practitioner and had performed a series of deliberate steps of assessment and treatment of patients as follows:

> (a)     applied topical local anaesthetic onto the treatment area prior to the administration of a potentially painful treatment;

> (b)     administered the medication beneath the skin surface using a series of injections with needles;

> (c)     and administered some post-procedural treatment in the form of antiseptic cream, ice packs or dressings.

18     Dr Matthew Yeo added that the fat melting injections were performed to alleviate undesirable aesthetic appearances and may be considered as an attempt to perform an aesthetic treatment, which is a subset of formal medical practice.

19     Finally, Dr Matthew Yeo noted that there were several potential complications that could arise from the use of fat melting injections which would require the immediate expertise of a registered medical practitioner and the expedient administration of appropriate treatment.

20     A copy of Dr Mathew Yeo’s independent medical expert opinion on fat-melting and Botox injections by a non-medical practitioner dated 12 April 2021 was annexed as part of the SOF.

## Antecedents

21     The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

22     The Prosecution tendered written submissions and submitted for a sentence of at least two to four weeks’ imprisonment for the proceeded charge.

23     The Prosecution submitted that the applicable sentencing framework for offences under s 17(1) of the MRA is the matrix as set out by the High Court in _Neo Ah Luan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 188</span> (“_Neo Ah Luan”_) at \[74(b)\]. The High Court in _Neo Ah Luan_ further set out a four-step sentencing approach in coming to the appropriate sentence for an offence under s 17(1) of the MRA at \[74(a) – (d)\].

24     Based on the sentencing approach as enunciated in _Neo Ah Luan_, the Prosecution submitted the following:

> (a)      First step – Identify the level of harm and level of culpability:

>> (i)       The level of harm caused by the accused in the present case was between the low to medium range. This was because the procedure carried out by the accused was similar to that in _Neo Ah Luan_, where the recipients of the injections did not suffer actual harm but the procedures were carried out in a non-sterile environment and this could result in complications. Further Dr Matthew Yeo was of the opinion that several potential complications could arise from the use of fat melting and Botox injections that would require the immediate expertise of a registered medical practitioner and expedient administration of appropriate treatment.

>> (ii)       The level of culpability was medium. This was because the accused admitted that she had started soliciting for customers in September 2020 and had performed fat melting injections for about 30 customers and Botox injections for about 10 customers for about six months between September 2020 and February 2021. The accused had therefore intentionally engaged in unauthorised medical practices. While the accused claimed that she was transparent with her customers by getting them to sign on consent forms as well as informing them that the injections were not locally approved, this showed that the accused was fully aware that what she did was wrong.

>> (iii)       The accused had also obtained financial gains from her four customers for the services rendered in relation to the four charges, they amounted to a sum of $1,828 for three of the victims (including the sum of $864 for the proceeded charge). The final victim could not remember the amount she paid to the accused;

> (b)      Second step – Identify the indicative sentencing range according to the matrix: Applying the sentencing framework, the Prosecution was of the view that the indicative sentencing range for the accused would at least be a short custodial term based on the level of harm at the range of low to medium and level of culpability at medium;

> (c)      Third step – Adjust the starting point according to offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors that have not yet featured in the analysis:

>> (i)       The Prosecution highlighted that in terms of mitigating factors, the accused has pleaded guilty to the charges and was untraced. The duration of the offending period in the present case (i.e. 6 months) was also not as long when compared to the offender in _Neo Ah_ Luan (i.e. 5 years).

>> (ii)       As for aggravating factors, the Prosecution reiterated that the accused knew that what she was doing was wrong in that she knew was not qualified to administer the procedures to her customers. There were also three TIC charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. They involved three other customers whom the accused had administered the procedures on separate occasions.

>> (iii)       Having considered the aggravating and mitigating factors, the Prosecution submitted that a short custodial sentence of between two to four weeks was appropriate. The Prosecution added that it was seeking for a shorter sentence than the six weeks’ imprisonment imposed on the accused in _Neo Ah Luan_ in view of the shorter duration of providing the illegal services of about 6 months;

> (d)      Step 4 - Make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle: The Prosecution was of the view that no adjustment was required to take into account the totality principle as there was only one proceeded charge. The sentence sought for was not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. It was also not crushing and is in keeping with the accused’s past record and future prospects.

## Mitigation

25     The Defence tendered a written mitigation plea and submitted for a non-custodial sentence or a fine to be imposed on the accused.

26     The Defence agreed with the Prosecution that the applicable sentencing framework for offences under s 17(1) of the MRA is the matrix as set out by the High Court in _Neo Ah Luan_.

27     Applying the sentencing framework, Defence Counsel submitted that the level of harm caused by the offence committed by the accused in the present case should be low. This was because at \[74\] of _Neo Ah Luan_, it was held by the High Court that low harm would generally be demonstrated where no actual personal injury was caused and there was low potential for personal injury; where the offence did not cause actual psychological or emotional harm to the victim; and/or where the offence did not undermine public confidence in the medical profession and healthcare system.

28     The Defence submitted that based on the SOF, no actual personal injury had been caused to the victims. There was also no evidence that any psychological or emotional harm was caused to the victim of the proceeded charge. Furthermore, the offence did not undermine any public confidence in the medical profession or healthcare system. The accused did not at any point in time represented herself or hold herself out to be a medical doctor or practitioner and had only referred to herself as a beautician.

29     Prior to undergoing the so-called aesthetic treatments provided by the accused, the customers were also informed by her of known risks and side effects arising from the use of fat melting injections. Customers were also informed that the fat melting injections used were not approved by HSA. Customers were also asked to sign a consent form before treatment was administered.

30     In view of the above, the Defence submitted that the accused had taken active steps to inform customers of the risks of being administered fat melting injections, the fact that she was not herself a medical practitioner and that the products being used were not HSA approved. There were no false representations made to the customers. Thus, public confidence in the medical profession and the healthcare system had not been undermined as the customers were taking their own calculated risks before even agreeing to undergo the relevant treatments being provided by the accused.

31     As for the potential for personal injury being caused, the Defence submitted that this might also be low. This was because while the Korean kybella solution (the brand name for kabelline) used by the accused has not have been approved by the HSA for use in Singapore, the same product has been approved for use in, inter alia, the United States of America and South Korea by their respective regulators like the US Food and Drug Agency ("FDA"). The approval of the said kybella solution by foreign regulators weighs in favour of the accused in that there is a relatively lower risk of potential injury caused by the use of such a substance.

32     As such, the Defence submitted that the question of illegality should clearly be distinguished from the question of potential injury which may arise.

33     In addition, the Defence referred to \[4b.\] of Dr Matthew Yeo’s independent expert opinion dated 12 April 2021 where it was stated in the last line that the incidence of complications or risks arising from fat melting injections are low, but actual figures were not available in medical journals. In the circumstances, the Defence highlighted \[67\] of _Neo Ah Luan_ where it was held that not every remote possibility of harm arising should be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence.

34     Furthermore, the Defence was of the view that the products used by the accused here were of lower risk than those used in _Neo Ah Luan_ as the latter involved unregistered dermal filler products for injection treatment.

35     As for culpability, the Defence submitted that this was also low in the accused’s case.

36     This was because first, as reiterated earlier, the accused had not held herself out or represented herself as being a qualified medical practitioner, having only referred to herself as a beautician.

37     Second, the Accused did not enlist the use of a hospital space or other healthcare premises when performing the treatment in order to conjure up a facade of legitimacy in front of her would-be customers.

38     Third, the Accused had also taken pains to emphasise the various known risks associated with fat melting injections before proceeding to administer such treatments on her customers and ensured that she only proceeded with the said treatments after obtaining their individual consent.

39     Finally, the accused had only administered the aesthetic treatments over a short period of less than 6 months, from September 2020 to February 2021.

40     As such, the Defence was of the view that the custodial threshold was not crossed in the present case.

41     The Defence further submitted that the fact that the accused had lacked professional liability insurance should not be construed or treated as an aggravating factor by relying on \[80\] of _Neo Ah Luan_.

42     On the other hand, the Defence emphasised that there were strong mitigating factors present in this case. The accused was sincerely remorseful and contrite for her actions. She had elected to plead guilty timeously, is untraced for any offences and had provided full cooperation with the investigations. She has also ceased providing the unauthorised medical aesthetic procedures. She is acutely aware of her need to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements and has undertaken never to reoffend again.

43     Another mitigating factor raised by the Defence was that the accused is suffering from chronic mood disorder with a mixture of manic states and depression. A copy of the accused’s medical report by Dr Yeo Seem Huat (“Dr SH Yeo”) dated 3 September 2021 was tendered to the court.

44     The Defence submitted that Dr SH Yeo was of the view that the accused's mental condition is likely to be aggravated by environmental stressors, including being placed in a prison environment. There is indeed a risk that the accused may suffer a relapse of her condition as a result of being sentenced to a term of imprisonment. It therefore submitted that a sentence of imprisonment would have debilitating effects on the accused’s ill health.

45     In the circumstances, the Defence urged the court to give due weight to the accused’s medical condition and impose a non-custodial sentence or a fine on the accused. This is especially given the fact that the accused’s behaviour was not egregious and she is not a hardened criminal such that a strong deterrent sentence was necessary for her to learn her lesson.

46     The Defence was asked by this court if it was relying on the medical report of Dr SH Yeo to seek for a community-based sentence on the basis of Dr SH Yeo’s opinion that there was a causal link between the accused’s long-term chronic mood disorder and her disinhibited behaviour and misjudgement in performing aesthetic procedures on customers without being a medical practitioner. If so, the court would give the Prosecution an opportunity to consider the medical report of Dr SH Yeo further.

47     Defence counsel replied that the Defence was not submitting on the issue of causal link as raised by Dr SH Yeo. Instead, the accused was relying on the medical report purely for mitigation purpose and that the court should take into consideration that a term of imprisonment is likely to cause the accused’s medical condition to worsen or suffer a relapse.

## Reply

48     In response to the accused’s mitigation, the Prosecution informed the court that whilst the medical report was not given to Prisons for their consideration, based on the accused’s medical condition, the medical centre at Prisons is in all likelihood able to manage her.

49     Furthermore, the Prosecution submitted that Dr SH Yeo’s opinion was vague since he simply indicated that “any severe pressure or environmental stress” on the accused would aggravate her mental state but did not elaborate further what these environmental factors or stresses are. In any case, they do not relate specifically to the accused being in a prison environment.

50     Finally, Dr SH Yeo did not provide any reason or basis for suggesting that the accused’s medical condition had a causal link with her having committed the offences. It was therefore a bare assertion.

## Decision on sentence

51     It was undisputed by the parties that the accused had performed acts which should only be performed by a registered or qualified medical practitioner. Therefore, the issue before me was the appropriate sentence to impose on the accused for the proceeded charge.

52     Sections 13 and 17(1) of the MRA read as follows:

>      **Qualifications to practise**

> 13.    Subject to section 66 —

>> (a)    a person must not practise as a medical practitioner or do any act as a medical practitioner unless the person is registered under this Act and has a valid practising certificate; and

>> (b)    a person who is not so qualified is called in this Act an unauthorised person.

>      **Unauthorised person acting as medical practitioner**

> 17.—(1)    Any unauthorised person who —

>> (a)    practises medicine;

>> (b)    wilfully and falsely pretends to be a duly qualified medical practitioner;

>> (c)    practises medicine or any branch of medicine, under the style or title of a physician, surgeon, doctor, licentiate in medicine or surgery, bachelor of medicine, or medical practitioner, or under any name, title, addition or description implying that he holds any diploma or degree in medicine or surgery or in any branch of medicine;

>> (d)    advertises or holds himself out as a medical practitioner; or

>> (e)    contravenes section 13 or 14,

>     shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

53     The penalties for unauthorised practice in the present MRA were enhanced from the 1985 MRA. The legislative intent behind this enhancement was highlighted by Sundaresh Menon CJ at \[66\] of _Neo Ah Luan_ and this was to:

>     \[p\]rovide a stronger deterrent against the illegal conduct of procedures by unauthorised persons. For example, during the Second Reading of the Medical Registration Bill, the Minister for Health noted that the much weaker penalties found in the 1985 MRA were a “grossly inadequate deterrent” (Parliamentary Debates at col 1562) and that the enhanced penalties would “enable the Government to act effectively against unauthorised persons who are illegally providing medical treatment and procedures” (Parliamentary Debates at col 1567).

54     In respect of the applicable sentencing framework when sentencing an accused for committing an offence under s 13 read with s 17(1) of the MRA, as pointed out by both the Prosecution and Defence, this is set out in the seminal decision by the High Court in _Neo Ah Luan_.

55     The High Court in _Neo Ah Luan_ laid down the sentencing approach when determining the sentence for a first-time offender who claims trial under s 17(1) of the MRA at \[74\] as follows:

> (a)    The first step would be to identify the level of harm and the level of culpability.

>> (i)     _Harm includes actual and potential bodily harm_, _as well as emotional or psychological harm to the victim, or the undermining of public confidence in the medical profession._ The level of harm may be characterised according to the following broad guidelines, though this is not to be applied in a rigid or mechanistic way:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="17.06%"> <col width="82.94%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- Where no actual personal injury was caused and there was low potential for personal injury;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- where the offence did not cause actual psychological or emotional harm to the victim; and/or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- where the offence did not undermine public</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">confidence in the medical profession and the</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">healthcare system.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Medium</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- Where there was some actual personal injury or substantial potential for serious personal injury;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- where the offence caused psychological or emotional harm to the victim; and/or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- where the offence undermined public confidence in the medical profession and the healthcare system.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- Where the offence caused serious personal injury, including injuries which are permanent in nature and which necessitate surgical attention;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- where the offence caused serious mental injury, in the sense of a recognisable psychiatric illness; and/or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- where the offence seriously undermined public confidence in the medical profession and the healthcare system.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

>> (ii)   Culpability would depend on the following non-exhaustive factors: the offender’s state of mind; the extent of profits gained by the offender from the unauthorised acts; the duration of the offending behaviour having regard to the circumstances underlying the continuance of the offending conduct; whether the offender held himself or herself out to be a registered medical practitioner; the sophistication involved in the offence, including the lengths to which the offender may have gone to evade detection or to perpetrate the misimpression that he or she was a duly qualified practitioner; the extent of premeditation and planning involved, including whether the offender came into Singapore for the purpose of committing the offences; and the extent to which the offender may have abused any position of trust, such as where the accused made use of his or her employment at a hospital or other healthcare institution to perpetrate the offence.

> (b)    The second step would be to identify the indicative sentencing range, according to the following matrix:

![]([2022] SGDC 0035_Image/[2022] SGDC 0035_image1.png)

> (c)    The third step would be to adjust the starting point according to offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors that have not yet featured in the analysis. Aggravating factors would include offences taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, relevant antecedents and an evident lack of remorse. Mitigating factors would include a plea of guilt and cooperation with the authorities.

> (d)    The fourth step would be to make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle, particularly where an offender has been punished with three or more sentences of imprisonment (see Logachev at \[81\] and Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> at \[72\]). \[emphasis added\]

56     In respect of harm, this relates not only to actual harm but realistic potential for harm that may be caused by the conduct of the offender. In _Neo Ah Luan_, it was held that deterrence would not be served if an unqualified individual who successfully performed an extremely risky medical procedure involving a high level of potential harm were to receive a lenient sentence because actual harm did not materialise. It would be appropriate to have regard to such potential harm if there was a sufficient likelihood of the harm arising and this should be assessed in the light of the gravity of the harm risked: see \[67\].

57     Additionally, it was held in _Neo Ah Luan_ that harm should not be limited to bodily harm or harm to a particular patient or victim. The courts may take into account other types of harm including serious mental distress, economic loss and harm to public confidence in the medical profession: see \[68\] and \[69\]. Finally, in assessing the level of harm or potential harm, the courts should be careful not to double-count any factors which may already have been taken into account in assessing the level of culpability: see \[70\]

58     I now come to the application of the sentencing framework to determine the appropriate sentence based on the present facts of the accused’s case.

### The level of harm

59     I agreed with the Prosecution that the level of harm in the accused’s case was between the low to medium range.

60     At the outset, I accepted that no actual harm, whether bodily, psychological or emotional harm, was caused to any of the accused’s customers. I further accepted that the offence did not undermine public confidence in the medical profession and the healthcare system given that the accused did not hold herself out to be a medical practitioner when performing such aesthetic treatments but a beautician who ran her beauty business in her own residential unit.

61     However, the level of harm is raised towards the medium range as the potential for harm or personal injury here could not be said to be low or insubstantial.

62     First, it was undisputed by the accused that both the fat melting injections (also known as Kabelline or deoxycholic acid) and the Botulinum toxin injections (also commonly known as Botox) used by the accused were unregistered health products and unapproved by HSA. This was the same for the local anaesthetic or numbing products, i.e. J-CAIN topical cream and Locana injection, used by her.

63     As such, the safety for use of these products used by the accused had not been tested, assessed or certified by the regulatory authority in Singapore. Hence, I disagreed with the Defence that the illegality of the products used is not a factor for consideration in determining the level of potential for personal injury that could be caused by using them.

64     On the contrary, the Defence seemed to have contradicted itself by suggesting that as the type of fat melting injections used by the accused might have been approved for use in the United States of America (“USA”) and South Korea based on its research, there is a lower potential for injury or harm being caused by the use of Kabelline.

65     Of course, if a product is banned by health regulators in many jurisdictions, it may be inferred that there could be a higher potential for injury or harm being caused by the use of that product such that it did not pass muster for legal use in majority of the instances. The converse may not necessary be true simply because a product has been approved elsewhere but not by the regulator in Singapore. A product could have been approved or unapproved for use in a certain manner or under certain conditions by a regulator due to various reasons and yet attract the same level of risk when using it. Ultimately, the approval for use of a certain product may be a holistic decision made by our local regulator upon due consideration.

66     In any case, there was no evidence before me to support the Defence’s assertion that the level of risk here from the use of Kabelline is indeed lower even if it has been approved for use in the USA and South Korea and not by the HSA in Singapore. Besides, even based on the research materials provided by the Defence, results of the clinical trial on Kabelline by way of an injection into the fat below the chin conducted in the USA confirmed that some of the possible side effects included nerve injury in the jaw and difficulty in swallowing. Other more common side effects of Kabelline included swelling (87%), bruising (72%), pain (70%), numbness (66%), redness (27%) and hardness (23%) in the area under the chin or lower jaw that was treated. 96% of those who participated in the trial had at least an injection site reaction.

67     Second, the Defence suggested that the possibility of harm arising from the use of Kabelline was remote because Dr Matthew Yeo was of the view that the incidence of complications arising are low. However, Dr Matthew Yeo elaborated that for both procedures involving fat melting injections and Botox injections, various types of risks have been reported. When such risks occur, emergency medical attention of a registered medical practitioner is required for the expedient administration of appropriate treatment. For example, in the use of fat melting injections, when vascular occlusion and skin ischemia occur, immediate medical treatment is required to prevent skin loss. In the use of Botox injection, when botulism and respiratory depression occur, emergency medical treatment is required to prevent the possibility of death.

68     Therefore, Dr Yeo was of the view that such procedures should not be performed by a non-medical practitioner in a HDB flat. The HDB flat is a non-sterile environment and ill-equipped with any medical facility to deal with complications that can arise from such invasive procedures. As described by one of the accused’s customers, after applying numbing cream on her, the accused made several needle injections of the fat melting products into the right side and left side of her waist, abdomen as well as on both her arms.

69     On top of that, in the consent form for lipo-dissolve mesotherapy which the accused asked her customers to sign before proceeding with the procedure, the accused listed the following possible risks related to mesotherapy and they are:

> (a)     Bruising of the skin

> (b)     Skin discomfort during injection

> (c)     Redness and slight swelling of the injection site

> (d)     Scarring of the skin (unlikely)

> (e)     Nausea, dizziness and possible allergies to Phosphatidylcholine (PC) + Carnitine or Deoxycholic acid may occur (though rarely).

The accused also provided mesotherapy post-treatment instructions to her customers in the event that any of the risks or side-effects occur.

70     It is hence not surprising that the prospect of actual harm occurring through conducting of such procedures by a non-medical practitioner and in a HDB flat was likely to increase. There was a sufficient likelihood of the harm arising and not merely a remote possibility of harm arising.

71     Third, there was once again no evidence before me to suggest or support the Defence’s proposition that the products used by the accused here were of lower risk than the unregistered dermal filler products used by the accused in _Neo Ah Luan_ where the level of harm was placed at low to medium due to the potential for some bodily injury.

72     Furthermore, both the fat melting and Botox treatment procedures require the products to be injected by way of a needle into the skin and absorbed by various parts of the body. This is similar to the dermal filler procedure where the products were injected into the skin at the face of a person. In fact, according to Dr Matthew Yeo, when executing the fat melting procedure, the accused even had to perform some degree of assessment to distinguish between fat and muscle tissues.

73     Hence, at the very most, I was prepared to accept that the level of risk and any consequent potential harm arising from the products used by the accused and the offender in _Neo Ah Luan_ and performed using a minimally invasive procedure by way of injection into the body tissue is similar.

74     It is pertinent to point out that both the accused and the offender in _Neo Ah Luan_ ran their beauty businesses in the same manner. They both offered unauthorised aesthetic treatment services using unregistered products to enhance the appearances of their customers from their homes even though they were not medical practitioners.

### The level of culpability

75     As for the accused’s culpability. I agreed with the Prosecution and was of the view that it was medium.

76     I accepted that the accused did not hold herself out to be a medical practitioner to her customers and that she was only a beautician. Yet, the accused’s conduct showed that she had intentionally engaged in the unauthorised practice of providing aesthetic treatments even though she was not a medical practitioner and hence was not qualified to do so.

77     The accused had informed her customers that the injections used by her were not locally approved by the authorities. She even went to the extent of creating a consent form for her customers to sign before she proceeded with the lipo-dissolve mesotherapy (or fat melting) procedure. This showed a certain degree of planning on her part. Her customer was stated as a “patient” in the consent form perhaps because she had adopted the form from a template used by doctors.

78     Contrary to the Defence’s submission that the accused’s conduct should reduce her culpability as she had not only taken active steps to inform her customers of the risks involved but had also not made any false representations to them by being transparent, I was of the view that the act of getting her customers to sign the consent form did not.

79     First, the fact that she had informed her customers of the risks involved prior to administering the fat melting procedure was something that she should and ought to have done whether or not she was a qualified medical practitioner. If she had not done so, her conduct would be considered riskier and more irresponsible towards her customers’ safety and this would amount to an aggravating factor.

80     Next, the accused’s action revealed her state of mind in that she unequivocally knew that she was not supposed to have performed the aesthetic procedure on her customers as she informed them in the consent form that:

> (a)     the treatment was strictly for elective aesthetic purposes and not for a medical requirement;

> (b)     the lipo-dissolving (or fat melting) treatment was not locally approved even though this has been approved by the “Korea FDA and USA FDA”; and

> (c)     localised lipo-dissolving treatment is practiced in other parts of the world.

81     In essence, what she was informing her customers in the consent form is that the aesthetic treatment she was going to perform is something illegal in Singapore even though this is not so in other parts of the world. She also told them of the risks involved but if they still wanted her to perform the procedure for them as the benefits outweigh the potential complications, they would have to agree by signing on the consent form. In effect, this was an agreement to perform an illegal act.

82     Thus, the actual reason for getting her customers to sign the consent form was because she had wanted them to release her from any liability of the procedure administered and to ensure that they would not make a claim against her should any of the risks occur.

83     Defence counsel pointed out at the hearing that there could be a potential issue with the enforcement of such a consent form given that it is tainted by illegality and likely to have no legal effect. Indeed, this could well be the case as besides being only a beautician, the accused was well aware that the products and treatment procedure she used were not approved in Singapore. She was therefore not covered by any professional liability insurance should she be sued.

84     Another possible reason for her action is that the accused might have wanted to emulate the actual steps and procedures taken by medical practitioners on their patients as far as possible when administering the treatment to her customers. As such, she even adopted the template of a consent form that might have semblance of it being used by doctors.

85     Whether it was for either or both reasons, this further affirmed my view that the act of making her customers sign the consent form stating all the risks involved did not and should not reduce the accused’s culpability to low as suggested by the Defence. There is a need for deterrence against illegal acts performed by unauthorised persons even if the customers acquiesce to such acts.

86     As for the scale of the accused’s operation, I accepted the submissions of both the Prosecution and Defence that the duration of her business was over a relatively short period of six months and during this period, she had a total of about 40 customers. This also formed part of the basis for the three TIC charges involving three customers. We did not have information on the total financial gain obtained by the accused during the six-month period. The financial gain for the proceeded charge was $864 and $964 for two of the three TIC charges.

87     Overall, I accepted that the scale of the operation in the present case is smaller than in _Neo Ah Luan_.

88     Taking reference from the sentencing framework in _Neo Ah Luan_, as stated above, based on a low to medium level of harm and a medium level of culpability, custodial threshold was crossed in the present case. I was of the view that the starting point sentence was four weeks’ imprisonment.

### Mitigating factors

89     I accepted that the accused has pleaded guilty, was untraced and cooperated fully with the authorities. She has also since ceased the operation of her beauty business. This should be accorded mitigating weight.

90     I have also accepted the Defence’s submission that it was not relying on Dr SH Yeo’s medical report of the accused for his opinion that there was a causal link between the accused’s long-term chronic mood disorder and her performing the aesthetic procedures on her customers without being a medical practitioner. In any event, I agreed with the Prosecution that Dr SH Yeo did not provide any reason or basis in coming to his opinion.

91     In respect of the Defence’s submission that the accused may suffer a relapse of her mental condition of chronic mood disorder if she is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, I agreed with the Prosecution that Dr SH Yeo’s opinion simply stated that any severe pressure or environmental stress would aggravate the accused’s mental condition but did not elaborate further. Additionally, I accepted that the medical centre at Prisons is in all likelihood able to manage the accused’s medical condition.

92     Having read the medical report of Dr SH Yeo on the accused, I understood that since 11 June 2004, the accused has been suffering from a mixture of manic state and pressure. Her condition became stable when she was on medication and mood stabiliser and when she did not have any work pressure or relational issues with her boyfriend.

93     However, in September 2020, Dr SH Yeo stated that the accused had quarrels due to conflicts with her Korean boyfriend. As a result, she had a relapse of her “manic state”. At the same time, she was not consistent in taking her medication.

94     As such, from Dr SH Yeo’s report, it would appear that the accused experienced a stressful period in September 2020 due to a combination of two factors. They were the irregularity in taking her medication and unhappiness in her relationship with her boyfriend at the material time. They did not appear to be related to her illegal home-based beauty business or any financial related issues.

### The sentence imposed

95     All things considered and having regard to all the circumstances of the case at hand, I was of the view that a sentence of 12 days’ imprisonment for the proceeded charge was just and appropriate.

## Conclusion

96     To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:
