### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mr Adnan Bin Saidi, a 59 year-old Singapore citizen had pleaded guilty to a charge of repeat drug consumption under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (commonly referred to as an LT2 charge) namely:

1 st Charge

> are charged that you, on or before 7th October 2019, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, Methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

> And further,that you, before the commission of said offence, were on 11th October 2001, in District Court 24, _vide_ DAC43648/2001, convicted of an offence of consumption of a Specified Drug, _to wit_, Morphine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 1998 Rev Ed) and punished under Section 33A(1) of said Act with 5 years and 6 months imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under Section 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       As the accused had admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification and as this was his third conviction for such an offence, I had sentenced him to eight years’ nine months’ imprisonment and made no order for caning in view of his age. I ordered his sentence to commence from 16 July 2020 as he was only placed in remand from 16 July 2020. Prior to that, he was serving the sentences for his previous drug-related conviction on 12 August 2015 from 14 March 2015 to 16 July 2020.

3       On 17 August 2020, he filed a notice of appeal against his sentence. The accused is presently serving his sentence and his earliest date of release is on 17 May 2026.

4       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

> **Statement of Facts**

> The accused had admitted the following facts:

>> The accused is Adnan Bin Saidi, a 59-year-old (D.O.B.: 29 May 1961) male Singaporean. At the material time, the accused was employed as a cleaner.

>> BACKGROUND AND ARREST

>> 2    On 7 October 2019 at about 8.30 p.m., the accused provided a positive urine sample while undergoing his surprise urine test at the Community Corrections Command, Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre, 1 Cosford Road, Singapore. The accused was placed under arrest and escorted to the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) office at Bedok Police Division for further investigation.

>> FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1ST CHARGE - CONSUMPTION OF SPECIFIED DRUG (DAC-907726-2020) – LT-2 LIABLE

>> 3    On 7 October 2019 at the CNB office, Bedok Police Division, the accused provided two bottles of his urine specimen, which were both sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked as “C-SG-19-93407-1 ADNAN BIN SAIDI ” and “CSG-19-93407-2 ADNAN BIN SAIDI” respectively in his presence.

>> 4    The urine samples were then sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis on 8 October 2019.

>> The analysis results, based on certificates issued under Section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), were as follows:

>>> a.    On 9 October 2019, Zhang HuiFen Hannah, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SG-19-93407-1 ADNAN BIN SAIDI”, issued a certificate under Section 16 of the MDA bearing Lab No. AT-1933-08934-001-03 stating that on analysis, the urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

>>> b.    On 9 October 2019, Tan Joo Chin, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SG-19-93407-2 ADNAN BIN SAIDI”, issued a certificate under Section 16 of the MDA, bearing Lab No. AT-1933-08934-002-03 stating that on analysis, the urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

>> 6    Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. 7 The accused admitted that he had smoked ‘air batu’ (street name for Methamphetamine) on 5 October 2019 inside the toilet at his working place. He placed 0.1g of ‘air batu’ inside an improvised bong which was a light bulb attached to a straw at the end of it. He inhaled the resultant smoke using a straw attached at the end of the improvised bong. The accused smoked ‘air batu’ once a week on Saturdays. He obtained the supply of ‘air batu’ from his friend known as ‘John’ for free at Bedok corner.

>> 8    The accused is not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume the aforesaid Specified Drug. He has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

>> 9    Before the commission of the said offence, the accused was on 11 October 2001, in District Court 24, _vide_ DAC43648/2001, convicted of an offence of consumption of a Specified Drug, _to wit_, Morphine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, and punished under Section 33A(1) of the said Act with 5 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date. The accused shall now be punished under Section 33A(2) of the MDA

>> 10    The accused admits to the above-mentioned offence and stands charged accordingly.

## Antedecents

5       The accused has the following drug-related antecedents:

> (a)     20.02.2000 – Three charges of failing to turn up for urine test under Rg 15(3)(f) Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (“MDR”). He was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment per charge with two of the charges ordered to run consecutively;

> (b)     11.10.2001 – One charge of repeat consumption of a specified drug under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(1) Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”)(“LT1”) and three charges of failing to turn up for urine test under under Rg 15(3)(f) MDR. He was sentenced to five years’ six months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for the LT1 charge and four months’ imprisonment per charge for the MDR charge. The LT1 charge and two charges under Rg 15(3)(f) MDR were ordered to run consecutively;

> (c)     12.06.2008 – One charge of drug importation under s 7 MDA and one charge of repeat consumption of a specified drug under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(2) MDA (“LT2”). He was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the drug importation charge and eight years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the LT2 charge. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently;

> (d)     12.08.2015 – One LT2 charge and one charge of unauthorised drug possession under s 8(a) punishable under s 33(1) MDA. He was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment for the LT2 charge and one year’s imprisonment for the unauthorised drug possession charge. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

6       The Prosecution highlighted that the accused had committed drug offences since 2000. It was submitted that this was his third LT2 conviction. In 2008, he was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. In 2015, he was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment. Accordingly, the Prosecution had sought an uplift in the sentence to eight years’ nine months’ imprisonment for the present charge.

## Mitigation

7       In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused sought for the lightest sentence possible. He asked for his sentence to be backdated to 7 October 2019, the date of his arrest for the present charge.

## Sentence

#### Prescribed Penalty

8       The prescribed punishment for an offence of repeat drug consumption under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(2) MDA is imprisonment for a term not less than seven years and not more than 13 years and not less than six strokes and not more than 12 strokes of the cane.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

9       In sentencing the accused, I took into account his early plea of guilt and the fact that he faced a single charge. Nevertheless, this was his third repeat drug consumption conviction for an LT2 offence which is an aggravating factor. Hence, it was not appropriate to impose the lightest sentence possible _ie_ the minimum prescribed penalty of 7 years’ imprisonment sought by the accused.

10     I was mindful that he was still serving the tail-end of his sentence in the community as part of the Singapore Prison Service community-based programme for his 2015 LT2 conviction when he committed the present offence. I noted that he had provided a positive urine sample after smoking methamphetamine on 5 October 2019 inside the toilet at his work place.

11     It is clear that his previous lengthy imprisonment terms for his drug-related offences had not sufficiently deterred him from re-offending. He had already been sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment in both 2008 and 2015 and hence it was unrealistic for him to expect the court to consider the minimum imprisonment period of seven years’. It was particularly aggravating that he had re-offended even before the completion of his sentences for the 2015 previous conviction. In my view, he had squandered the rehabilitation opportunity afforded to him to enable him to reintegrate back to society after the completion of his earlier sentences. Under these circumstances I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift in sentence from his previous sentence was necessary.

12     Accordingly, after a careful consideration the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct, I imposed a sentence of eight years’ nine months’ imprisonment for DAC 907726-2020. Pursuant to s 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 Rev Ed 2012) I made no order for caning in view of his age as it is prohibited for men who are more than 50 years of age at the time of the caning. In my view such a sentence could not be considered as manifestly excessive in light of the circumstances of the present case.

#### Commencement of sentence

13     I ordered his imprisonment term to commence from 16 July 2020 as he was only placed in remand from 16 July 2020 after the completion of his earlier sentences. Prior to that, he was serving the sentences for his 2015 previous drug-related conviction from 14 March 2015 to 16 July 2020. Under such circumstances, I was not in a position to consider his request to backdate his sentence to 7 October 2019, his date of arrest for the present charge. My other alternative was to order the commencement of the sentence at a _later_ date _ie_ from 13 August 2020, an option which I had not exercised.

14     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused has filed a notice of appeal against his sentence and is presently serving his sentence.
