### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Prasanth s/o Mogan (“**Prasanth**”) is 21 years of age.

2       On 2 March 2021, shortly after midnight, he and four others assaulted a 17-year-old male (the “**Victim**”). They punched, kicked and stepped on the Victim at his head and torso areas repeatedly. Prasanth also slashed the Victim’s right forearm with a pocketknife. He then humiliated the Victim by stripping the Victim of his clothes until the Victim was fully naked. He recorded a video of the Victim, including the Victim’s genitals. He instructed the Victim to dance while the video was recorded. After recording the video, he asked the Victim to kiss his shoe. He threw the Victim’s clothing into some bushes and threatened to leak the video on social media if the Victim lodged a police report over the incident.

3       Prasanth was 19 years old at the time of the incident. He was subsequently charged with three offences under the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”): (a) a charge of rioting with a dangerous weapon, under s 148; (b) a charge of recording the video without the Victim’s consent, under s 377BB(4); and (c) a charge of criminal intimidation, under s 506.

4       On 6 April 2022, he pleaded guilty to the first two charges, and the third charge was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Pre-sentence reports were called to assess his suitability for probation and reformative training. He was found suitable both for probation and reformative training.

5       While rehabilitation remained a dominant sentencing consideration given Prasanth’s young age, there was nonetheless a need for deterrence and even retribution taking into account his culpability and the harm caused to the Victim in the incident. Accordingly, on 12 August 2022, Prasanth was sentenced to undergo reformative training with a minimum period of detention of 12 months. He was allowed to defer his sentence by one week to attend to personal matters. He filed the present appeal against the sentence on 18 August 2022. The execution of the sentence has been stayed, and he is on bail pending the appeal.

6       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Proceeded charges

7       Prasanth pleaded guilty to the following two charges:

> DAC-904331-2021 (1st charge) (the “**Rioting Charge**”)

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on 2 March 2021, at about 12.15am, at the rooftop of the multi-storey carpark located at Blk 693A Woodlands Avenue 6, Singapore 730693, together with:

>> a.    Veeranaath s/o V Kannan, a 21-year-old male Singaporean \[NRIC number redacted\] \[“**Veeranaath**”\];

>> b.    Satish Jason s/o Prabahas, a 20-year-old male Singaporean \[NRIC number redacted\] \[“**Satish**”\];

>> c.    Sharan Boy Joseph s/o Prabahas, a 23-year-old male Singaporean \[NRIC number redacted\] \[“**Sharan**”\]; and

>> d.    \[“**AAA**”\], a 17-year-old male Singaporean \[NRIC number redacted\],[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> were a member of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to voluntarily cause hurt to \[the Victim\], then a 17-year-old male Singaporean, and in the prosecution of the common object of such assembly, one or more of you had used violence against \[the Victim\], _to wit_, by (i) punching, kicking and stepping on \[the Victim\] at his head and torso areas repeatedly and (ii) slashing \[the Victim\] on his right forearm with a pocketknife, while one or more of you were armed with a pocket knife, which is a deadly weapon, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 148 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). 

> MAC-910662-2021 (2nd charge)

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on 2 March 2021, at about 12.15am, at the rooftop of the multi-storey carpark located at Blk 693A Woodlands Avenue 6, Singapore 730693, did operate equipment without the consent of \[the Victim\] with the intention of enabling you to observe \[the Victim’s\] genitals in circumstances where the genitals would not otherwise be visible, _to wit_, you used your handphone (iPhone X) to record a video of \[the Victim\] while he was standing naked in front of you, knowing that \[the Victim\] did not consent to you operating the equipment with that intention, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 377BB(4) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

8       The offence under s 148 is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and the offender is also liable to caning.

9       The offence under s 377BB(4) is punishable under s 377BB(7) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

### Facts

10     These were the salient facts.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

11     Prior to the incident, there had been a dispute between the Victim and Prasanth, Sharan and Satish (who were accomplices in the Rioting Charge). The dispute involved the Victim’s interactions with one “**Nithiya**” (who was the girlfriend of Prasanth, the younger sister of Satish and Sharan, and the ex-girlfriend of the Victim.)

12     On 1 March 2021 at about 7.30 pm (the evening before the incident), the Victim was dining with his colleagues at a restaurant at Yuan Ching Road (the “**restaurant**”). Veeranaarth, one “**Yuvaraj**” (a 20-year-old male) and Nithiya were part of the group dining at the restaurant. At about 9.00 pm, Sharan appeared at the restaurant and confronted the Victim over the dispute. The Victim’s colleagues prevented Sharan from approaching him. As the Victim was trying to leave the restaurant, Sharan threw a glass bottle at the Victim’s direction (which did not hit the Victim). The Victim left the restaurant at about 9.30 pm to prevent the situation from escalating.

13     Soon after, Prasanth, Satish and AAA arrived at the restaurant. Prasanth instructed Veeranaarth to find out where the Victim was and to inform him of the Victim’s location. Veeranaarth agreed.

14     Veeranaarth arranged a meet-up with the Victim at the rooftop of the multi-storey carpark located at 693A Woodlands Avenue 6, Admiralty Grove, Singapore 730693 (the “**incident location**”). Veeranaarth invited Yuvaraj along on the pretext of having drinks with the Victim. Veeranaarth and Yuvaraj took a private-hire taxi to the incident location to meet the Victim.

15     In the meantime, at about 9.50 pm, Prasanth, Satish, Sharan, AAA and Nithiya left the vicinity of the restaurant and went to the residence of Satish, Sharan and Nithiya located at Block 801A Keat Hong Close.

16     At about 10.00 pm, the Victim met with Yuvaraj and Veeranaarth at the incident location. They chatted and drank alcohol. While they were doing so, Veeranaarth called Prasanth and informed him of their location.

17     On 2 March 2021, at about 12.15 am, while Veeranaarth, Yuvaraj and the Victim were drinking, Prasanth together with Satish, Sharan and AAA arrived at the incident location. Prasanth and the accomplices (Sharan, Satish, AAA, Veeranaarth) had the common object of voluntarily causing hurt to the Victim.

18     Upon noticing the arrival of Prasanth, Satish, Sharan and AAA, Veeranaarth held both the Victim’s arms and punched him on the jaw area once to prevent him from escaping. The Victim fell to the ground and landed amongst some bushes. While the Victim was on the ground, Prasanth and the accomplices punched, kicked and stepped on the Victim at his head and torso areas several times.

19     Prasanth then took out a pocketknife and threatened to slash the Victim if he did not get out of the bushes. As the Victim felt weak and could not get up, Prasanth slashed the Victim once on his right forearm with the pocketknife.

20     Prasanth further threatened to stab the Victim if he did not stand up. While the Victim was attempting to stand up, he was punched by Satish and Sharan at his face and torso area, causing him to fall down a second time. At this point, Veeranaarth and AAA kicked and punched the Victim at his head and torso area.

21     Prasanth then started to remove the Victim’s clothing, assisted by Satish, Sharan and AAA, until the Victim was naked. Prasanth then used his handphone to record a video of the Victim naked, while Veeranaarth turned on his flashlight to ensure that the Victim was visible. During the recording of the video, Prasanth instructed the Victim to dance. (In doing so, Prasanth had operated equipment without the Victim’s consent with the intention of enabling him to observe the Victim’s genitals in circumstances where the Victim’s genitals would not otherwise be visible, knowing that the Victim did not consent to him operating the equipment with that intention.) When Prasanth was satisfied with the video recorded, he asked the Victim to kiss his shoe. The Victim complied. Prasanth then threw the Victim’s clothing into the bushes and threatened that he would leak the video on social media if the Victim lodged a police report over the incident.

22     Prasanth and the accomplices then left the incident location.

23     The Victim lodged a police report about the incident later that day. He was examined at the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on 3 March 2021, and noted to have suffered the following injures after the incident:[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

> (a)     Left maxillary sinus and left orbital fractures;

> (b)     Right forearm laceration wounds;

> (c)     Left chest wall and hypochondrium muscle strain;

> (d)     Abrasion wounds “secondary to claimed assault”;

> (e)     Incidental prominent nasopharynx soft tissues.

## Sentencing

### Charge taken into consideration

24     One charge was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This related to Prasanth committing criminal intimidation by threatening to post the video of the Victim online if the Victim lodged a police report over the incident, an offence punishable under s 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code. (MAC-910663-2021)

###    Pre-sentence reports

25     Prasanth had no prior convictions. The prosecution did not object to the calling of pre-sentence reports to assess his suitability to undergo probation and reformative training (“**RT**”). Counsel for Prasanth urged the court to call only for a probation pre-sentence report, stating that he was a young offender and had good family support.

26     In my judgment, while rehabilitation was an important sentencing consideration given Prasanth’s young age at the time of the offences, there was also a need for deterrence and retribution, given his culpability in the offences and the harm caused to the Victim. I accepted the submission of the prosecution that a pre-sentence report for RT ought to be called, in addition to a probation pre-sentence report.

27     Prasanth was found to be suitable for both probation and RT.

28     The Probation Officer’s Report dated 13 May 2022 (the “**Probation Report**”) recommended that Prasanth undergo 24 months’ split probation (6 months intensive, 18 months supervised), with various conditions including a time restriction of 11.00 pm to 6.00 am, electronic monitoring for six months, 80 hours of community service and to attend a Decision Making and Conflict Resolution Workshop.

29     In the Pre-Sentencing Report for Reformative Training dated 10 May 2022 (the “**RT Report**”), Prasanth was found to be physically and mentally suitable to undergo the RT regime. The conclusion of the RT report was that:

> Prasanth’s needs include addressing his attitudes that perpetuated his violent offending behaviours, his association with his antisocial peers, his emotional regulation deficit and developing concrete feasible risk management strategies surrounding his violence use.

A “Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation” was recommended if he was sentenced to RT.

### Prosecution’s submissions

30     The prosecution submitted that Prasanth ought to be sentenced to RT at level 2 intensity as recommended.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) The principles of rehabilitation and deterrence applied in the present case. While rehabilitation remained the dominant sentencing consideration as he was a youthful offender, the seriousness of the offences committed by him warranted a degree of deterrence, and RT was the appropriate rehabilitative sentence.

31     It was highlighted that a first-time adult offender for an offence of rioting _simpliciter_ would likely be sentenced to an imprisonment term of at least 18 months (_Phua Song Hua v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 33</span>). Here, Prasanth committed a rioting offence armed with a dangerous weapon, which would attract an even higher sentence. The Victim suffered serious injuries, including two fractures (left maxillary sinus and left orbital) and right forearm lacerations.

32     It was also submitted that Prasanth’s culpability was highest among the accomplices. He had effectively engineered and orchestrated the assault on the Victim. He instructed Veeranaath to find out where the Victim was and inform him of their location. He later brought the other accomplices to the incident location to assault the Victim. The offence was premeditated. Prasanth and the accomplices cornered the Victim at a deserted rooftop before physically assaulting him. It was a case of group violence; and Prasanth and the accomplices vastly outnumbered the Victim five to one. Prasanth wielded a pocketknife in the commission of the offence and used it to slash the Victim. He then stripped the Victim and used his handphone to record a video of the Victim naked. He further humiliated the Victim by demanding that the Victim dance while naked and bleeding. He threatened to post the video on social media if the Victim lodged a police report.

### Mitigation plea and defence’s submissions

33     Counsel for Prasanth urged that he be placed on probation.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

34     It was acknowledged that Prasanth’s offences were serious. In mitigation, however, it was submitted that he committed the offences out of anger as he heard that the Victim possessed nude photos of his (Prasanth’s) girlfriend and her sister. He possessed a pocketknife as it was a tool he used for work, and he kept it with him as he was still attending to work calls before meeting with the accomplices. He used the pocketknife to slash the Victim out of anger, as the Victim had hurled insults about his family members. He threw the pocketknife away after the incident as he realized he had reacted impulsively and was afraid of the possible consequences.

35     Prasanth was a person with special needs, and had been issued a card for people with special needs by the National Council of Social Services. Despite that, he was gainfully employed. Probation would allow him to continue with his employment which would give him the opportunity to turn over a new leaf and become a responsible member of society. Conversely, a sentence of RT might be crushing and not in keeping with his future prospects, considering the uphill task for him to land full-time employment after his release.

36     His offences were a one-off incident which stemmed from legitimate anger but the failure to exercise consequential thinking. There was little or no risk of him reoffending. He was genuinely remorseful and dedicated to change his life.

### Sentencing considerations

#### Framework for sentencing of young offenders

37     The sentencing of a young offender involves two distinct but related stages, as explained by the High Court in _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> at \[28\]:

> It is well established that when a court sentences a youthful offender, it approaches the task in two distinct but related stages (_PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> \[…\] at \[77\]–\[78\]). At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the second stage of the inquiry, which is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.

38     The two stages of the sentencing process are:

> (a)     Stage 1: to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations; and

> (b)     Stage 2: to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet the sentencing considerations.

#### Primary sentencing considerations: rehabilitation and deterrence

39     In the present case, rehabilitation was an important sentencing consideration given Prasanth’s relatively young age when he committed the offences. That said, I accepted the submission of the prosecution that the offences were serious, and Prasanth played a central role in orchestrating the assault and humiliating the Victim, which caused serious harm to the Victim (summarised at \[31\]-\[32\] above). In the circumstances, _deterrence_ and even _retribution_ were also relevant sentencing considerations.

40     That Prasanth was a person with special needs and had committed the offences out of anger towards the Victim (as mentioned by Prasanth’s counsel) did not detract from the need for deterrence and retribution given the serious nature of the offences.

#### Appropriate sentence: reformative training

41     In my judgment, the appropriate sentence for the rehabilitation of Prasanth, while bearing in mind the need for deterrence and retribution, was reformative training. RT would provide “a middle ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence in relation to young offenders”: _PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> (“**_Al-Ansari_**”) at \[58\].

42     Counsel for Prasanth had urged that he be placed on probation on the basis of his good rehabilitative prospects. It must be borne in mind, however, that in the course of seeking the right balance between rehabilitation and deterrence, “rehabilitation as a dominant consideration does not inevitably mean probation orders”: _Al-Ansari_ at \[63\]. Further, as was explained in _Al-Ansari_ at \[65\]:

> Apart from probation orders, reformative training functions equally well to advance the dominant principle of rehabilitation, and may even represent a better balance between the need for rehabilitation and deterrence. \[…\]

43     In the present case, a probation order would not adequately meet the need for deterrence and retribution. The offences committed by Prasanth were egregious. The offence of rioting armed with a deadly weapon would ordinarily have called for a lengthy custodial term. Yet, Prasanth did not appear to have appreciated the gravity of his offences. In the Probation Report, among the risk factors highlighted by the probation officer was that Prasanth _minimized his role_ in the offences and _externalized blame_, which indicated “his anti-social attitude and a lack of readiness to take responsibility for his actions” (at p 2, third bullet point). Similarly, in the RT Report, it was stated that Prasanth “presented with a failure to assume responsibility over his actions, and instead attributed the responsibility of his behaviours on his friends and the victim” and “he presented with a tendency to minimise his violence” (at p 7-8). In my judgment, in order to impress upon him the severity of his offending conduct with the view to reforming him, the sentence must incorporate a custodial component that is deterrent and retributive as well.

44     All in, I was satisfied, having regard to Prasanth’s character and the circumstances of the offences (including the central role played by him in the assault and humiliation of the Victim), that to reform him and to prevent him from committing further crime, he should undergo RT.

### Sentence imposed

45     Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of reformative training with a minimum period of detention of 12 months, as recommended in the RT Report. The execution of the sentence has been stayed, and Prasanth is on bail pending the appeal.
