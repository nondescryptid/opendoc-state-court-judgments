Building and Construction Law – Terms – Authorised deductions from stakeholding sum

Limitation of Actions – Particular causes of action

9 October 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       In these proceedings begun by way of District Court Originating Summons No 67 of 2020 (“OSS 67”) the applicant seeks an order that the respondents authorise the Singapore Academy of Law (“SAL”) to release to it a sum of $64,450 that SAL holds “as stakeholder” (the “Stakeholding Sum”) in respect of a residential property transaction between the parties. The applicant seeks in the alternative an order that the respondents pay it the sum of $64,450.

2       The applicant is the developer of the condominium development called Waterbank at Dakota. The respondents purchased from the applicant a unit within that development (“the Unit”) by way of a sale and purchase agreement dated 30 April 2010 (“the SPA”). Pursuant to the terms of the SPA the respondents paid 5% of the purchase price, that is the Stakeholding Sum, not to the applicant but to SAL. On the “Final Payment Date” as defined in the SPA – I understand it not to be disputed that this was 4 June 2014 – the Stakeholding Sum was to have been paid to the applicant “less all authorised deductions”. This has not been done. The money continues to this day to be held by SAL.

3       The applicant filed OSS 67 on 19 June 2020. The respondents resist the application on two main grounds. The first is that the applicant is not entitled to the Stakeholding Sum because it has failed to meet its obligation under the SPA to rectify defects in the form of structurally unsafe windows in the Unit and throughout the development. The second is that the applicant’s claim is time-barred because OSS 67 was filed more than six years after its cause of action arose on the Final Payment Date. This latter argument gives rise to a novel and interesting legal issue of what period of limitation, if any, is applicable to the claim that the applicant has advanced by way of OSS 67.

4       When I first heard OSS 67 on 14 August 2020 I adjourned the matter so that the applicant could file an affidavit in response to the respondents’ reply affidavit and parties could prepare and file and exchange written submissions. The next hearing of OSS 67 was fixed on 2 October 2020 but two weeks before that, on 18 September 2020, the respondents filed District Court Summons No 3068 of 2020 (“SUM 3068”) seeking an order that the proceedings in OSS 67 be continued as if they had been begun by writ pursuant to O 28 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Ed). Nonetheless parties agreed that I should hear substantive argument in both OSS 67 and SUM 3608 on 2 October 2020 and so that is what I did.

5       For the reasons to follow I dismiss SUM 3068 and in respect of OSS 67 order that (a) SAL release the entirety of the Stakeholding Sum to the applicant and (b) the respondents pay the applicant interest on $64,450 at the statutory rate of 5.33% per annum for the six years from 20 June 2014 to 19 June 2020 being the date on which OSS 67 was filed. I deal first with the issue of whether the applicant has lost its entitlement to the Stakeholding Sum by reason of its failure to rectify defects, and then I address the more difficult question of whether the applicant’s claim is time-barred.

## The defects issue

6       The respondents took possession of the Unit in June 2013. They say that they discovered thereafter “a slew of defects and unsatisfactory works in the Unit”. In six lists of defects that they submitted to the applicant they identified 146 defective items. They say that even though the applicant rectified some of the defects it failed to rectify others. In any event for the purpose of these proceedings they invoke only a single class of defect, namely the allegedly defective design and installation of casement windows in the Unit.

7       As to the windows the respondents complain that they are structurally unsafe because (a) the window panes, also known as window leaves, are too wide, and (b) the metal hinges that support the window panes, which are also known as friction stays, are too short to fulfil their function of securing and holding in place the window panes and preventing them from “sagging or falling off” when the windows are opened or closed. Over time, the respondents say, the sagging of the window panes will cause the entire window structure to “get dislodged and fall off”, and given that the Unit is on the 13th floor that could result in “very serious and/or fatal injury” to a passer-by below. The respondents rely on a document published by the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) that is titled “Guidelines for Window Works” and sub-titled “Minimum Safety Requirements for Installation/Replacement of New Aluminium Windows”. According to this document, for aluminium casement windows the width of the window leaf cannot exceed 700mm and the length of the friction stay must be not less than half the width of the window leaf. The respondents say that in the Unit there are three window leaves with a width of 940mm and four with a width of 800mm, and the length of the friction stays is about 305mm, hence these window leaves and their friction stays do not meet the requirements prescribed in the HDB document. The first respondent adds that he speaks with knowledge and expertise and is “able to understand safety issues that affect any building development project” because he was “in the construction business for many years involved in aluminium and glazing works”.

8       The applicant does not accept that the windows are defective. It says that the requirements in the HDB document apply only to HDB flats, and that for private condominium developments such as this “the applicable regulation is the Singapore Standard SS 212:2007 – Specification for Aluminium Alloy Windows”. The applicant points to the fact that a professional engineer and the project architect both certified that all the windows in the entire development had been designed and installed in accordance with that regulation, and it claims that the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) also provided confirmation of compliance in a letter to the first respondent. In addition the applicant relies on the favourable outcome of functional tests carried out on “a window of similar design” by what it describes as “an independent third party”. In their turn the respondents say that the certifications by the project architect and the professional engineer are unreliable, the former because it was based on the self-serving representations of the window manufacturer and the latter because it was premised on the weight rather than the width of the windows. They say that the test results that the applicant relies on are worthless because the window sample on which testing was done came from a different development and at 600mm wide was significantly narrower than the window leaves in the Unit. The respondents also say that the applicant has misinterpreted the letter from the BCA.

9       I do not think it can be doubted that the question of whether the windows in the Unit and in the development were defective involves very substantial disputes of fact. Counsel for the respondents Mr Liew Teck Huat argues that this is precisely why the proceedings in OSS 67 should be continued as if begun by writ. But I consider that there is no need for me to decide that question in order to perform my task in these proceedings of determining the destination of the Stakeholding Sum. The reason is that even if the respondents can establish that the windows were defective they are not permitted under the terms of the SPA to withhold any part of the Stakeholding Sum from the applicant on the basis alone of the existence of defects. Instead they are entitled to withhold only so much of the Stakeholding Sum as is needed to reimburse them for expenses that they actually incurred in rectifying defects that the applicant failed to rectify. There is no dispute that the respondents did not carry out any rectification work on the windows in the Unit and so incurred no such expenses.

10     In this connection the material terms of the SPA are found in cll 5 and 17. As I mentioned earlier, on the Final Payment Date SAL was obliged to pay the Stakeholding Sum to the applicant “less all authorised deductions”, as provided for in cl 5.4(a)(ii). Clauses 17.1 to 17.3 set out the circumstances in which “authorised deductions” can be made in relation to defects. Given their importance I reproduce these clauses here:

> **17**.     **DEFECTS LIABILITY PERIOD**

> 17.1  The Vendor \[that is, the applicant\] must make good at his own cost and expense any defect in the Unit, the Housing Project or the common property which becomes apparent during the defects liability period, namely, the period of 12 months from the date the Purchaser \[that is, the respondents\] receives the Notice of Vacant Possession in respect of the Unit.

> 17.2  The Vendor must make good any such defect within one month of his receiving a notice from the Purchaser requiring the Vendor to make good such defect, failing which the Purchaser may do the following:

>> (a)    notify the Vendor of his intention to cause rectification works to be done and the estimated cost of carrying out those works; and

>> (b)    give the Vendor an opportunity to carry out the proposed rectification works within 14 days after the date of the notice in paragraph (a), failing which he may proceed to rectify the defect by his own employees or workmen.

> 17.3  If the Vendor, after having been duly notified under clause 17.2, fails to carry out the rectification works to make good the defect within the specified time, the Purchaser has the right to cause the rectification works to be carried out and to recover from the Vendor the cost of those rectification works. _The Purchaser may deduct the cost of those rectification works from any sum held by the Singapore Academy of Law as stakeholder for the Vendor_.

> \[emphasis added\]

11     From the express language of cl 17.3 it seems clear to me that if the respondents wish to make any authorised deduction from the Stakeholding Sum on account of a defect they must in fact have “carried out” at their own cost “rectification works to make good the defect”. It is only then that they may look to the Stakeholding Sum for reimbursement. This interpretation of cl 17.3 is supported by the decision of District Judge Ng Peng Hong in _UOL Development (Jurong West) Pte Ltd v Chan Chong Neng and another_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGMC 38</span>, which was cited by counsel for the applicant Mr Terence Wah. That decision concerned a clause (also numbered 17) identical in substance if not also in form to cl 17, and District Judge Ng held that the defendants were “not entitled to withhold the stakeholding monies, as they have not caused the alleged defects to be rectified, which is a requirement under Clause 17 of the S&P Agreement if the Defendants wish to deduct the cost of rectification from the stakeholding sums”: at \[10\]. I wholly agree with that view.

12     Moreover, it appears from cl 17.2 that in order to avail themselves of this right to reimbursement out of the Stakeholding Sum the respondents must first have given the applicant (a) notice of their “intention to cause rectification works to be done and the estimated cost of carrying out those works” and (b) an opportunity to avoid paying that estimated cost by carrying out the works at the applicant’s own expense. As Mr Wah pointed out, the respondents did neither of those things even if they had previously given the applicant multiple notices requiring it to make good various defects including the alleged defects in the windows. In any case, as explained above the lack of rectification works carried out by the respondents is by itself fatal to their assertion of entitlement to withhold the Stakeholding Sum from the applicant

13     Faced with cl 17 Mr Liew contended that the applicant was precluded from relying on it because the applicant had itself committed a “serious” and “fundamental” breach of the SPA by failing to rectify the window defects. Mr Liew also contended that the respondents should be excused from any omission to satisfy the requirements of cl 17 because it was “impossible” for them to have carried out the rectification works themselves, in that the window defects afflicted not only the Unit but also the entire development including the common property and other units owned by other people, and it would not have been within their rights to carry out rectification works outside the Unit.

14     I am unable to accept either of Mr Liew’s contentions. Even if the applicant had committed a “fundamental” breach of the SPA such as would allow the respondents to terminate the SPA, I do not believe that the respondents wish to exercise any right of termination that may have arisen given that their manifest intention is to remain the owners of the Unit and not to return it to the applicant and obtain a refund of the purchase price. That being the case it seems to me that the terms of the SPA continue to govern the rights and obligations of the parties. I do not understand it to be the law that this ceases to be so for no other reason than that one party has breached the SPA, however serious and egregious that breach might be. And even if the window defects extend beyond the Unit I cannot see why it is “impossible” for the respondents to comply with cl 17. The notion of impossibility presents a very high threshold, and so even accepting the respondents’ inability to do rectification works outside the Unit I perceive no reason why it would be impossible for the respondents to comply with cl 17 by carrying out inside the Unit those works that they indubitably have the right and power to carry out. If the respondents wish to avail themselves of their right under cl 17 to make an authorised deduction from the Stakeholding Sum I do not think it right to exonerate them from complying with that clause to the extent possible.

15     I therefore consider that the window defects alleged by the respondents, even if established, do not furnish them cause to withhold or deduct any part of the Stakeholding Sum that is due to the applicant for the simple reason that they have not carried out any work to rectify those defects and thus have incurred no cost in that regard. I need not and do not make any finding as to whether the windows in the Unit and the development are unsafe and defective, and I do not think it desirable, let alone necessary, to have these proceedings continue as if begun by writ just so that the evidence that would enable me to make such an irrelevant finding can fully be adduced. I do not find this unfair or unjust in any way because it has always been open to the respondents to commence a claim seeking damages from the applicant to compensate them for any loss caused by the defects. That, and not resort to the Stakeholding Sum, is their proper recourse in the absence of rectification works that they carried out themselves. I express no opinion on whether such a claim by the respondents for damages would be time-barred by now.

16     For the sake of completeness I should mention that I am aware that in its recent decision of _Sandy Island Pte Ltd v Thio Keng Thay_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 86</span> the Court of Appeal discussed at some length a contractual clause (also numbered 17) identical in substance to cl 17 in this case. Neither party cited that decision but I do not think this matters any because the views and conclusions I have expressed above seem to me not inconsistent with it.

## The time-bar issue

17     The upshot of my reasoning so far is that the applicant is entitled to receive the entirety of the Stakeholding Sum from SAL unless there is some other ground to hold otherwise. The only other ground advanced by the respondents is that the applicant’s claim is time-barred. They argue that the claim or action is “founded on a contract” within the meaning of s 6(1)(_a_) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) and so “shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued”. They say that the cause of action accrued on 4 June 2014 being the Final Payment Date, hence the six-year period of limitation had expired by the time OSS 67 was filed on 19 June 2020.

18     I should first reject outright one argument from each side. On the applicant’s part, its primary position is that its claim is not one “founded on a contract”, but it submits in the alternative that even if that were so the claim is not time-barred because “there is a continuing breach of contract each and every day” that the respondents do not release the Stakeholding Sum to it. The applicant relies on _Lim Check Meng v Orchard Credit Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 709</span> (“_Lim Check Meng_”), a decision of Lai Kew Chai J in the High Court. In that case a car owned by the appellant was seized by the Registrar of Vehicles on 23 March 1985 because the respondent had failed to pay various fees and taxes. The appellant commenced an action against the respondent on 14 October 1992, more than six years after the seizure of the car. This was an action “founded on a contract”, and one of the appellant’s claims in the action was for damages for “breach of the term for quiet enjoyment” of the car by reason of the seizure: at \[18\]. Lai J held that it was “not right in law to conclude that the cause of action accrued only on the first day of the … seizure”, that is 23 March 1985, and that the correct position was instead that the “breach occurred every day the car was not returned to the possession and enjoyment of the appellant”: at \[19\]. Thus Lai J held that the appellant’s “causes of action which accrued on or after 15 October 1986 were not time barred”, and for that reason the appellant was entitled to damages for “the breaches of the implied term of quiet enjoyment which took place daily on and from 15 October 1986 until 30 April 1987” when the car was returned to the appellant: at \[20\].

19     The applicant argues that, in the same vein, its cause of action against the respondents did not merely accrue once and for all on the Final Payment Date but rather accrued anew every day the respondents did not release the Stakeholding Sum to it. The applicant accepts that it is not entitled to claim interest on the Stakeholding Sum prior to 20 June 2014, the date six years before OSS 67 was filed, but says that it is entitled to the Stakeholding Sum as well as interest on it from 20 June 2014. But I cannot agree. I think _Lim Check Meng_ can be distinguished on the basis that the breach there concerned the use and enjoyment of specific property whereas in these proceedings the respondents’ breach involves fungible money. If it is right to cast the respondents’ breach as a continuing breach every day of an obligation to give the applicant enjoyment of its money, then it appears to me that every claim arising out of non-payment of money owed can be similarly characterised with the result that all such claims would never become time-barred. This cannot be correct because it seems to me beyond doubt that in such claims – for instance a lender’s claim for repayment of money lent to a borrower or a seller’s claim against a buyer for payment of the purchase price of goods – the cause of action accrues once and for all on the date that payment was due but not made and the action becomes irreparably time-barred six years after that date. I think the applicant’s claim must be treated on the same footing. If indeed its claim is one “founded on a contract” I consider that _Lim Check Meng_ has no application and I would be compelled to hold that the cause of action accrued on 4 June 2014 and that the claim had become time-barred by the time OSS 67 was filed, the result being that the applicant cannot recover the Stakeholding Sum let alone any interest on it.

20     This brings me to the respondents’ argument that I reject outright. Mr Liew submits that the applicant is precluded from contending that its claim is not one “founded on a contract” because it has conceded the point by making references in its supporting affidavit to “breach of contract” by the respondents. But the straightforward answer to this is that the applicant’s present position is unequivocally that its claim is not “founded on a contract” and I do not know of any rule or doctrine that would prevent it from renouncing any prior inconsistent statement, especially where that statement concerns not a point of fact within a party’s personal or special knowledge but a matter of objective legal classification that is ultimately for the court to decide.

21     In its written submissions on the time-bar issue the applicant says that the “ultimate issue” in these proceedings is “who has the better right to the Stakeholding \[Sum\]” as between it and the respondents. It contends that once the respondents pay the Stakeholding Sum to SAL the applicant “acquires the proprietary interest in these stakeholding sum subject only to the \[respondents’\] contractual right of ‘set-off’” and hence the respondents have “no proprietary right at all” to the money. While this is somewhat obliquely expressed I take it to be an argument that the applicant’s claim is founded not on a contract but on a proprietary right to the Stakeholding Sum or a beneficial interest in it. During the hearing I asked Mr Wah if the applicant was relying, either directly or by way of analogy, on s 22(1)(_b_) of the Limitation Act, which provides that no period of limitation and no time bar applies to “an action by a beneficiary under a trust … to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof in the possession of the trustee”. Mr Wah said that he was content to make an alternative submission that the applicant’s claim falls within s 22(1)(_b_) but the applicant’s primary position remains that its claim is not one that falls within any of the provisions of the Limitation Act, which means in turn that the claim is not subject to any period of limitation and may never be time-barred.

22     I think there is merit in the applicant’s contention that its claim is founded on a proprietary right to the Stakeholding Sum. There is no doubt that SAL has no beneficial interest whatsoever in the money and as stakeholder holds it purely for the benefit of someone else. Given that the Stakeholding Sum is a percentage of the purchase price and that the applicant is as seller ordinarily entitled to all of the purchase price having transferred the thing purchased, that is the Unit, to the respondents as buyers, it must follow that the applicant is at least presumptively that someone else for whose benefit SAL holds the Stakeholding Sum. To the extent it is suggested that the applicant lost any proprietary right it might have had because it transferred to the respondents not the complete thing purchased but a defective thing, I do not think that is accurate because I understand the law to be that a seller of goods is ordinarily entitled to the whole of the purchase price even if the goods are defective unless the defects are so fundamental as to give the buyer the right to terminate the contract of sale and the buyer in fact chooses to do so. Although the buyer of defective goods might be able to set off against the purchase price any loss caused to it by the defects, I believe that to be no more than a measure of practical convenience and it does not alter the seller’s strict legal right to receive the entirety of the purchase price. That being so the starting point remains that the Stakeholding Sum beneficially belongs to the applicant and so its claim to the money can fairly be said to be founded on an assertion of a proprietary interest.

23     As against this the principal difficulty in the applicant’s way is that it is undeniable that its entitlement to the Stakeholding Sum is derived from a contract, that is the SPA. Even though it asserts a proprietary right to the money, if that right arises out of a contract it would seem, as Mr Liew submits, that a claim asserting that right would be “founded on a contract” within the natural and ordinary meaning of those words. Suppose SAL were not at all involved in the transaction and the facts were simply that the respondents paid the applicant 95% of the purchase price but held back the remaining 5%. I think there is no question that in those hypothetical circumstances any claim by the applicant to the 5% would be “founded on a contract” and so be time-barred if the action is commenced more than six years after the applicant became entitled to receive the 5%. On the applicant’s case the mere interposition of SAL as stakeholder in respect of the 5% would make all the difference in terms of the period of limitation and it is not immediately apparent why this should in principle be so.

24     The point strikes me as a finely balanced one but what for me tilts the scales firmly in the applicant’s favour is a consideration of the absurdity of the consequences that would ensue if the respondents’ argument succeeds. Mr Liew is correct to say that the practical outcome of holding that an action is time-barred cannot be a reason to hold that it is not time-barred, but I think that the absurd nature of the consequences does in the context of these proceedings shed light on the otherwise ambiguous nature of the applicant’s claim.

25     If the respondents’ argument succeeds and the applicant’s claim is held to be time-barred, the Stakeholding Sum will continue to be held by SAL. Should the respondents thereafter seek to assert their entitlement to the money, I would think that any such claim by them would equally be time-barred because it would be just as much based on the SPA and as such just as much “founded on a contract” as the applicant’s claim is in these proceedings. The result of this is that the Stakeholding Sum would forever be in the possession of a stakeholder that has no beneficial interest in the money and no ability whatsoever to use it. I think it self-evident that this would be an insensible and irrational state of affairs to bring about.

26     A possible alternative analysis of the consequences is that the failure of the applicant’s claim would mean that the right to receive the Stakeholding Sum automatically reverts to the respondents as the parties who paid the money to begin with, meaning that if the respondents thereafter write to SAL directing that the money be released to them SAL will be obliged to comply. That would take care of the concern that the Stakeholding Sum might be caught for good in no man’s land. But it must follow that if it had been the respondents instead who initiated proceedings to determine the fate of the Stakeholding Sum their claim would be dismissed and the applicant would then become entitled to direct that SAL release the money to it. This too would be absurd because it would mean that once the six-year period of limitation has lapsed the identity of the party entitled to receive the Stakeholding Sum would depend completely on the identity of the party that commenced court proceedings to have the issue decided when that should on any view be an irrelevant factor. I think therefore that it cannot be right that dismissing the applicant’s claim would automatically confer on the respondents the right to receive the Stakeholding Sum. The correct position, as I understood Mr Liew to acknowledge, must be that SAL would simply continue to hold on to the Stakeholding Sum. That then brings matters back to the original absurdity of SAL being saddled in perpetuity with the obligation to hold money in which it has no beneficial interest.

27     It is true that in some sense there is absurdity present every time a limitation argument is successfully deployed to resist a claim, in that the outcome of the dispute turns not on the substantive merits of parties’ positions but on nothing more than the timing of the commencement of the claim. But the absurdity in these proceedings seems to me to be of a different kind. In the usual case where a claim is time-barred the losses and gains simply lie where they have fallen: the purchaser who has not paid the purchase price keeps goods as well as money and the seller is bereft of both, and the borrower who has not repaid the loan retains whatever benefit it has obtained from the use of the borrowed funds. In other words there is in the usual case at least a definite destination for the valuable thing in dispute even if it may be thought that the destination is not the ideal one. In contrast there is in this case no real destination at all for the Stakeholding Sum if the applicant’s claim is time-barred.

28     Mr Liew submits that if this absurdity represents a lacuna in the law it is for the legislature to fill it by amending the Limitation Act and not for me to patch up in piecemeal fashion on the particular facts of this case. But I think that there is no lacuna after all. When s 22(1)(_b_) of the Limitation Act is considered together with s 22(2) it appears to me that the legislature did cater for the variety of absurdity under discussion. These provisions state that “an action by a beneficiary under a trust” is not subject to any period of limitation if the action is brought “to recover from the trustee trust property” that is “in the possession of the trustee”, but the very same species of action by a beneficiary to recover trust property is subject to a six-year period of limitation in all other situations. Hence if for instance the trustee has transferred the trust property to a third party the beneficiary’s action to recover that property from the third party will be subject to the six-year limitation period. For ease of reference I reproduce these provisions of the Limitation Act:

> **Limitation of actions in respect of trust property**

> **22.**—(1)    No period of limitation prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by a beneficiary under a trust, being an action —

>> (_a_)    …

>> (_b_)    to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof in the possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and converted to his use.

> (2)    Subject to subsection (1), an action by a beneficiary to recover trust property or in respect of any breach of trust, not being an action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by any other provision of this Act, shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the right of action accrued.

29     I think it is telling that the legislature has seen fit to distinguish cases in which the trust property remains in the possession of the trustee and cases in which the property is no longer in the trustee’s possession. The principle I draw from this is that where the legal and beneficial interest in property do not reside in the same person the legislature abhors a vacuum so far as the beneficial interest is concerned. Where the trustee has possession of the trust property, dismissing the beneficiary’s action to recover it would mean that it remains for all time in the possession of a person who enjoys no beneficial interest in it. As I have said that seems to me a self-evidently absurd outcome. On the other hand, where the trust property is no longer in the trustee’s possession, dismissing the beneficiary’s action leads to no such absurdity because the beneficial interest would simply be retained by the third party to whom the property had been transferred. Comparing the two scenarios I infer that the reason why no period of limitation is imposed on the beneficiary’s action in the former scenario even though a finite period is prescribed in the latter is that the legislature wished to avoid the absurd outcome of the trust property becoming stuck in perpetual limbo in the trustee’s hands.

30     Accordingly I think that the consequences that would ensue if I hold in these proceedings that the applicant’s claim is time-barred constitute precisely the type of senseless outcome that the legislature wished to avoid in instituting s 22(1)(_b_) of the Limitation Act. Reading s 6(1)(_a_) in harmony with the rest of the Limitation Act including s 22(1)(_b_), I conclude that the applicant’s claim is from a purposive point of view not one that is “founded on a contract” within the meaning of that provision and so is not subject to the six-year period of limitation stipulated therein for such actions. It does not appear to me that the applicant’s claim sits well within any of the other provisions of the Limitation Act, and I agree with Mr Wah’s contention that this means that the claim is subject to no period of limitation at all and cannot ever be time-barred.

31     Having said that I am also prepared to hold, even though I need not do so, that the applicant’s claim is in the nature of an action by a beneficiary to recover trust property (the Stakeholding Sum) in the possession of the trustee (SAL) for which provision is made in s 22(1)(_b_) of the Limitation Act and is thereby expressly a claim to which no period of limitation applies. I do not at all suggest that SAL necessarily owes to the persons for whose benefit it holds money the full range of duties that a trustee ordinarily assumes towards the beneficiaries. I mean only to say that in my view the fact that SAL holds the Stakeholding Sum for the benefit of the applicant suffices to make the former a “trustee” and the latter a “beneficiary” for the purpose of s 22(1)(_b_).

32     That is sufficient to dispose of the time-bar issue but before leaving it I wish to express my doubts as to the correctness of a submission made by the applicant. This is the submission that if the respondents had complied with the procedure for making “authorised deductions” under cl 17 of the SPA their claim to receive from SAL so much of the Stakeholding Sum as has been deducted would be one “founded on a contract” and thus be subject to the six-year limitation period. It appears to me that this hypothetical claim by the respondents would equally involve the assertion of a proprietary right over the Stakeholding Sum and so be of the same kind and nature as the applicant’s claim in these proceedings. That being the case I am not sure it is tenable to contend that one is subject to the limitation period but the other is not. It seems to me that either both are or both are not. But it is unnecessary for me to state a firm opinion on this point and so I do not.

## Conclusion

33     For all these reasons I hold that the applicant is entitled to the whole of the Stakeholding Sum because the respondents have not made any “authorised deductions” from it, and I find that the applicant’s claim to the money is not time-barred, meaning that there is no reason to deny the applicant relief in relation to the Stakeholding Sum. I consider that I am able to reach these conclusions notwithstanding the disputes of fact that have arisen in these proceedings in OSS 67, and thus I hold that there is no basis to order that the proceedings be continued as if begun by writ and dismiss SUM 3068.

34     The exact terms of the relief sought by the applicant in OSS 67 are that the respondents authorise SAL to release the Stakeholding Sum to it. But I see no reason why I cannot simply make an order that SAL do so. My understanding from r 7(3)(_b_) of the Singapore Academy of Law (Stakeholding) Rules (Cap 294A, R 2, 1998 Ed) is that SAL will release any disputed sum that it holds as stakeholder on receipt of a “court order on the final apportionment or division of the disputed amount”. There is no suggestion that the respondents will be able to stop payment of the Stakeholding Sum to the applicant once such an order has been served on SAL. Thus, rather than make an order directed at the respondents requiring that they give SAL authority to make payment to the applicant, it appears to me a more convenient course to make an order expressly and directly regarding the “final apportionment or division” of the Stakeholding Sum. Hence I order that SAL release to the applicant the entirety of the Stakeholding Sum in the amount of $64,450.

35     I think the applicant is entitled to interest from the respondents for having been kept out by them without legal basis from the Stakeholding Sum even though it was entitled to receive all that money on the Final Payment Date. The applicant claims interest at 6.75% per annum on the ground that the SPA prescribes an interest rate for late payments set at 2% above a base rate calculated using the “prevailing prime lending rates” of three banks. But cl 6.1 of the SPA specifically excepts the late payment of “any instalment to be paid by the stakeholder” from the contractual interest rate. The Stakeholding Sum is obviously and squarely such an instalment. The applicant argues that the respondents should nevertheless pay interest at the contractual rate because “all parties knew that this would be the loss that the \[applicant\] would suffer if any of the purchase price was withheld by the \[respondents\]”. I reject this contention because it flies in the face of the clear terms of the SPA. Hence I think that the applicant is entitled instead to interest at the statutory rate of 5.33% per annum. In written submissions the applicant sought interest from 20 June 2014 to 19 June 2020 being the date on which OSS 67 was filed. In so doing the applicant properly concedes that any claim for interest between the Final Payment Date and 20 June 2014 is time-barred. Given that as at the date of its written submissions the applicant was prepared not to claim interest beyond the date OSS 67 was filed I award the applicant interest on $64,450 at the rate of 5.33% per annum for a period of exactly six years.

36     I thank counsel on both sides for the large measure of assistance I received from their detailed submissions.
