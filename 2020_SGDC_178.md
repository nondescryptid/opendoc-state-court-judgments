### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mr Teo Cheng Kit, a 52 year-old Singapore citizen had claimed trial to two charges namely:

> (a)     **DAC-941457-2018 – 1st Charge**

> …are charged that you, sometime in 2012, Singapore, being an agent to wit, Assistant General Manager of CWT Logistics Pte Ltd (“CWT”), did knowingly use with intent to deceive your principal, CWT, a document in respect of which CWT is interested, to wit, an email from Velia of ETW Logistics Pte Ltd dated 10 January 2012, and which contains statement which is false, and which to your knowledge is intended to mislead CWT, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap. 241).

> (b)     **DAC-941458-2018 – 2nd Charge (Amended)**

> …are charged, in this amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68), that you, on 987 occasions between 2012 and 2014, did embark on a course of conduct to cheat employees of CWT Logistics Pte Ltd (“CWT”) by deceiving these employees into believing that you had declared to Leaw Tiew San, Chief Executive Officer of CWT, that your wife, Yanti Rusly, is the sole director and shareholder of ETW Logistics Pte Ltd (“ETW”) and dishonestly induced these employees to award freight jobs with total value of $634,590.18 to ETW which they would not have done if they were not so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 417 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224).

2       As a matter of background, when the case was first mentioned in Court 26 on 21 December 2018, the Prosecution had initially preferred 1,000 charges against the accused but had applied for 11 charges in DAC-942477-2018 to DAC-942487-2018 to be recorded as being entered in error. Subsequently, during the status pre-trial conference on 12 March 2020, the Prosecution further indicated that at trial, an application would be made for his remaining 987 cheating charges under s 417 of the Penal Code to be recorded as being entered in error (“EIE”).

3       On 13 July 2020, the first day of the trial, the accused pleaded guilty to **41** charges, namely the charge under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, Rev Ed 1993) as well as 40 amended charges under s 417 of the Penal Code. He also consented to have **947** charges under s 417 Penal Code taken into consideration. His remaining cheating charge in DAC-941746-2018 was recorded to have been entered in error.

4       As the accused had admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification, I imposed the following sentences on him:

Pursuant to s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012), I ordered the sentences for 13 charges, namely DAC-941457-2018, DAC-941458-2018, DAC-941618-2018, DAC-941765-2018, DAC-941779-2018, DAC-942118-2018, DAC-942182-2018, DAC-942184-2018, DAC-942224-2018, DAC-942259-2018, DAC-942289-2018, DAC-942405-2018 and DAC-942457-2018 to run consecutively. The sentences for the remaining 28 charges as reflected above were ordered to run concurrently. The global sentence imposed was 18 months’ and one week’s imprisonment.

5       The accused then sought a deferment of the commencement of his sentences to 3 August 2020 to settle his personal affairs. I ordered his imprisonment term to commence on 3 August 2020 and extended his existing agency bail. Nevertheless, on 24 July 2020, he filed a notice of appeal against the sentences. The accused appeared before me for a post-sentence mention on 27 July 2020 and I ordered bail pending appeal at $30,000 with one surety or $15,000 with two sureties. The accused was initially on bail pending appeal but had subsequently elected to surrender himself on 3 August 2020 to commence serving his sentences.

6       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Statement of Facts

7       The accused had admitted the following facts:

> A.    INTRODUCTION

> 1 The accused is Teo Cheng Kit (male / 52 years old),…a Singapore Citizen. He is also known as Elwi.

> 2 The accused’s wife is Yanti Rusly. She is also known as Velia.

> 3 The accused commenced employment in CWT Logistics Pte Ltd (“CWT Logistics”) in 2007 as a Trade Manager. He was subsequently promoted to Senior Manager (Freight Management) in July 2010 and to Assistant General Manager in July 2012.

> B.    BACKGROUND

> (_i_)     _CWT Logistics Pte Ltd_

> 4    CWT Logistics is a wholly owned subsidiary of CWT Limited. CWT Limited is in the business of offering third party logistics services to its clients.

> 5    CWT Logistics has two main types of business: Loose Container Load (LCL) and Full Container Load (FCL). LCL refers to the buying and selling of loose container space to clients. FCL refers to the buying and selling of full container spaces to clients. CWT Logistics engages freight forwarding companies or shipping carriers (“vendors”) to fulfil clients’ LCL or FCL orders.

> 6    As the Senior Manager (Freight Management) and subsequently the Assistant General Manager at the material time, the accused’s duties included managing a team of customer service officers (“CSOs”) who were in charge of processing clients’ orders, documentation and invoicing, and arranging for payments to vendors. The processing of clients’ orders included contacting freight forwarding companies to book freight space for clients’ cargo. The CSOs who were under the accused’s supervision at the material time included Chen Yoon Theng (“Chen”), Tai Yen Chuan (also known as Joyce), Tan Shi Huan (also known as Evelyn), Lee Soo Chen (also known as Helen) and Ivy Chaw Jo Yin.

> (_ii_)   _ETWL Pte Ltd_

> 7    Sometime in October 2011, Velia set up ETWL Pte Ltd (“ETWL”) with Carls Maclord Chia Bak King and Mike Ng Ho Ming. On 29 November 2011, an agent profile with code 94873 was created for ETWL in the Internet Supply Chain Management (“ISCM”) system of CWT Logistics. CWT Logistics subsequently awarded some jobs to ETWL.

> 8    ISCM is the platform used by CWT Logistics to capture orders placed with vendors, and is ultimately used for the billing of clients and payments to vendors. The award of a job to a vendor entails placing a booking (usually by email or phone) with the vendor and the creation of a work order on ISCM where the various details of the freight job are input. The Finance Department of CWT Logistics (“Finance”) subsequently checks the details on ISCM against the invoices provided by the vendor (e.g. the amount to be paid) before disbursing payment to the vendor.

> 9    The creation of an agent profile in ISCM is required for CWT Logistics to create work orders to the vendor in question and thereafter process payment for the orders.

> (_iii_)   _ETW Logistics Pte Ltd_

> 10    Sometime in January 2012, Velia set up ETW Logistics Pte Ltd (“ETW Logistics”). Velia was the sole director and shareholder of ETW Logistics at all material times. ETW Logistics is a separate entity from ETWL and the two companies are entirely unrelated.

> C.    FACTS RELATING TO THE 1st CHARGE (DAC-941457-2018)

> 11    On 10 January 2012, Velia sent the accused an email at his CWT Logistics email address informing him that ETWL had changed its name from “ETWL Pte Ltd” to “ETW Logistics Pte Ltd”. The accused knew that this was not true as ETW Logistics was a separate entity from ETWL.

> 12    Despite knowing this, the accused forwarded the email to Chen and instructed her to update ETWL’s agent profile in ISCM to reflect the purported name change. As the agent profiles in ISCM can only be amended by Finance, Chen sought Finance’s assistance with this. Finance accordingly amended ETWL’s agent profile in ISCM to reflect the name “ETW Logistics Pte Ltd”.

> 13    When the accused forwarded the email to Chen, he knew that the email from Velia contained a statement which was false in a material particular and which was intended to mislead CWT Logistics into believing that ETWL and ETW Logistics were the same entity. The email was additionally a document in which CWT Logistics was interested as it concerned an existing supplier of the company. Despite knowing the aforementioned facts, the accused knowingly used the said document with the intent to so deceive CWT Logistics.

> 14    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s 6(_c_) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).

> D.    FACTS RELATING TO THE CHEATING CHARGES

> 15    On 19 January 2012, the accused directed his team of CSOs to make FCL bookings with ETW Logistics from February 2012 onwards. The accused knew that it was a conflict of interest to have his team of CSOs award jobs to ETW Logistics, his wife’s company. The accused therefore told the CSOs that he had declared to the CEO of CWT Logistics, Leaw Tiew San, that his wife was the sole director and shareholder of ETW Logistics. This was not true as the accused did not make such a declaration to Leaw.

> 16    Pursuant to the accused’s representation that he had made the declaration to Leaw, the respective CSOs awarded the following freight jobs to ETW Logistics:

> 17    The accused therefore deceived the CSOs into believing that he had declared the conflict of interest to Leaw, which fact he knew to be false. As a result of the deception, the CSOs were dishonestly induced to award the aforementioned 40 freight jobs to ETW Logistics which they would not otherwise have done. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed 40 counts of an offence under s 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008).

> 18    In total, the CSOs were cheated into awarding 987 freight jobs to ETW Logistics with a total value of **$634,590.18**. ETW Logistics made a profit of at least **$223,284.53** from these freight jobs.

## Antedecents

8       The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

9       In support of its sentencing position, the Prosecution had tendered a table of sentencing precedents for offences under s 417 of the Penal Code.

With regard to the cheating charges, the Prosecution had relied primarily on the High Court case of _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“_Idya Nurhazlyn”)_ where the High Court imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment for a charge involving $1,800.

10     It was the Prosecution’s case that as the amounts in the present case were roughly similar, sentences of three to five weeks’ imprisonment per charge were sought. It was submitted that given the sheer number of transactions involved, at least 20 of such charges should run consecutively for a global sentence of at least 20 months’ imprisonment.

11     It was further submitted that for the s 6(c) Prevention of Corruption Act charge, a sentence of one week’s imprisonment should be imposed which should also run consecutively as the offences pertained to different legally protected interests. In support of its position on sentence, the Prosecution had similarly tendered a table of sentencing precedents for the single corruption charge.

## Mitigation and Defence’s submissions on sentence

12     In his written plea in mitigation, it was highlighted that the accused is presently 53 years of age and comes from a family of seven siblings (one brother passed away in 2008 due to illness). He is married with five children, aged 19, 16 (twins), 10 and 5 respectively. His father passed away in 1994. His mother is presently 86 and lives with the accused. His mother has hypertension and hypercholesteroledaemia and has been under treatment since June 2002.

13     It was submitted that the accused was hired by CWT Logistic Pte Ltd (“CWT”) in 2006 to start a new freight department and CWT is a warehousing company. The accused was hired due to his many years of experience in international sea freight. His object was to expand CWT’s portfolio by creating a sea freight department from scratch. Thus, instead of CWT’s customers engaging a third party to forward/carry its goods to destination, the accused was hired to convince these current clients’ of CWT, to forward their goods to destination using CWT itself. The accused was also tasked to bring in new clients.

14     It was highlighted to the best of the accused’s knowledge, the profits from the freight department that he created were such that in 2007 was $160,000.00, in 2008 - $380,000.00, in 2009 - $420,000.00, in 2010 - $650,000.00, in 2011 - $900,000.00, in 2012 - $1.2 million and in 2013 - $1.4 million. The accused was terminated in July 2014. It was submitted that all these monies were net profits made by CWT.

#### Use of ETW Logistics Pte Ltd

15     It was submitted that sea freight can be broken up into two categories; FCL and LCL. FCL is the abbreviation for Full Container Load, this means that the goods the customer intends to send by ship to destination can be placed into a 20 ft or 40 ft container. LCL is the abbreviation for Loose Container Load. This is where the customer’s goods do not fill up a 20ft or 40ft container but is less than that. Therefore, there are consolidators who lease containers from the shipping lines and make the space in these containers available at a price.

16     It was further submitted that although CWT now had a freight department, it did not always do all the work itself. It sub-contracted the work to a freight forwarder. According to the Defence, ETW Logistics Pte Ltd (“ETW Logistics”) was one such freight forwarder. What the freight forwarder does is to match the clients’ requirements of date/transit time/carrier/port/type of goods for a particular cost. This meant that CWT would instruct the freight forwarding company of the type of goods for the port of destination. This information would also contain other requirements, for example a certain period of transit time, a preferred carrier, a precise loading date and time at the port, extra time for demurrage, a precise discharging date and time. All this was for a particular cost.

17     It was highlighted that it was crucial for the court to note, that in essence, CWT would instruct ETW Logistics to book space to load a certain cargo bound for a certain port. Thus, ETW Logistics would have to pay for the sea freight of the shipping lines, the DG (Dangerous Goods) surcharge (if any), the container seal fee and Bill of Lading fee first, before ETW Logistics billed CWT for the work done. It was further highighted that in essence, all these had to be deducted before ETW Logistics’ profit could be deduced. The despatch cost is for the Bill of Lading to be forwarded to the end customer and sometimes, a copy of it was also needed by CWT.

18     It was submitted that the cost was not the only factor in awarding the work order to ETW Logistics. There were other factors that were taken into account. According to the Defence, certain customers, notably Stahl Asia Pte Ltd were very demanding due to the nature of their goods. Thus, there were times that ETW Logistics would have to pay extra to the despatch company as there were deadlines for the Bills of Lading to be delivered to customers. It was submitted that the total sum of the 41 charges did not reflect the total sum as within it, was contained the cost of sea freight and DG surcharges, the same applied to the sum total of all the charges.

#### The cheating charges

19     It was the case for the Defence that for the s 417 offences, there were a whole host of cases namely credit cards as well as thousand and thousands of cases. It was submitted that the present case was not a public sector case where there were public funds involved. This was a private sector case and there was no public interest concerns. It was not internet-based, nothing to do with financial institutions, credit cards, transfers etc. It was further submitted that this was not the usual case where one individual cheats someone and the victim suffered loss.

20     It was the Defence’s case that the CWT freight department had made substantial profits. The personnel had obtained their increments and bonuses all from the accused’s efforts in setting up the department. It was noted that the Prosecution had informed Counsel that there were cases where the freight forwarder had quoted less and hence the loss suffered by CWT would be quantifiable.

21     It was submitted that the accused had pleaded guilty at quite a last minute. He was working under a misapprehension that his case would not be the end of it, something else would have happened and someone else would be charged. He had indicated to his Counsel that if the case stopped with him, he would have pleaded guilty and the case would have been dealt with in 2018 and he would have been released by now. Unfortunately, the accused has had all this stress, he worked through all the stress and he had come to the point where basically the accused was remorseful and he had pleaded guilty. This was his first time in court. Ultimately, the biggest factor was that he realised the impact of his actions on his family, especially his children.

#### Global sentence

22     Although the Prosecution had asked for a global of 20 months’ imprisonment, the Defence had sought for a much less global sentence of nine months’ imprisonment. According to the Counsel, he believed that this was a very unique case and this was not the usual run-of-the mill corruption and s 417 charges. It was further submitted that the court had the discretion to see the case on its particular facts and impose a fair and considered sentence on the accused. His Counsel urged the court to give the accused a second chance as he realised his fault and the loss suffered was not really quantifiable by CWT at this point of time. His Counsel asked for leniency on behalf of his client.

## The Prosecution’s Reply

23     In response to the Counsel’s reference to the absence of public funds, credit card fraud, cheating of financial institutions or cheating of public institutions, firstly it was submitted that it is well established that these were all aggravating factors so the absence of these factors simply meant that the accused’s sentence would not otherwise be higher.

24     Secondly, it was further submitted the emphasis on the purportedly difficult customer Stahl Asia Pte Ltd or on the apparent lack of quantifiable loss to CWT, all this detracted from the substance of the charges which was that the CSOs were essentially duped into awarding the freight jobs to ETW Logistics. So while it was true that the CSOs considered a variety of factors, one of which was cost, the point here was that they made no such assessment. They were first directed to award the jobs to ETW Logistics and when they raised their concerns about the conflict of interest, they were told that the requisite declaration had been made. So that was really the essence of what the Prosecution was looking at. That was why the Prosecution had highlighted in the Statement of Facts the profits made by ETW Logistics. While the total value of the freight jobs was over $600,000, the Prosecution recognised that the jobs were completed so CWT had received the services they had paid for but the figure of $223,284.53 more accurately captured the benefit to ETW Logistics. This was the profits that they had earned by securing the jobs that they would not otherwise have done and this was the relevant figure.

25     Responding specifically to the submissions for a global sentence of nine months’ imprisonment by the Defence, it was first highlighted that there had been no restitution in this case. It was further highlighted that the second case in the sentencing table _PP v Chen Chen Chang_ DAC 940848/2016 & Ors, was a case where the total amount involved was $138,102.50 with full restitution made. The accused there was given a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment.

26     It was submitted that given the quantum in the present case was higher and accounting for the lack of restitution, a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate calibration. It was further submitted that while this was not a run-of-the-mill case, it is trite that with financial crimes the most pertinent factor is the quantum and that was what the Prosecution had compared across the precedents cases to the present case.

## Sentence

#### Prescribed Penalties

27     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is a fine not exceeding $100,000, or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, or to both.

28     In addition, the prescribed punishment for an offence under s 417 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment with may extend to three years, or with a fine, or to both.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

29     In general, it is clear from the difference in the prescribed punishments that an offence under s 6 (c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is considered to be more serious than an offence under s 417 of the Penal Code. It is also trite that for cases involving corruption, the paramount sentencing consideration is one of general deterrence. In addition, for an offence under s 417 of the Penal Code, a custodial sentence would generally be appropriate as long as the offence in question causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value (see _Idya Nurhazlyn_ at \[47).

#### Sentencing approach for multiple offences

30     The present case involves multiple offences as the accused had pleaded guilty to 41 charges and had consented to have 947 charges taken into consideration. In sentencing the accused, I was guided by the recent decision of Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP_ \[2014\] 4 SLR 838 at \[19\] where he held:

> 19 The _Shouffee_ methodology implies, at a more general level, that sentencing for multiple offences comprises two analytically distinct steps which are to be taken in sequence. First, the court must determine the appropriate individual sentence in respect of each charge. Second, the court must determine the overall sentence which should be imposed. The issue of which of the individual sentences ought to be run consecutively is an important aspect of the inquiry at the second step, but it is only one aspect of it. Another aspect of that inquiry, which is particularly relevant in this kind of case, is whether the totality of the offender’s conduct justifies an adjustment in the individual sentences decided at the first step in respect of each charge.

Hence, I first had to determine the appropriate individual sentence for each proceeded charge and the next step was to determine the global or overall sentence which should be imposed after making the appropriate adjustments.

### Step one – determining the individual sentences

#### s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act

31     In the present case, the accused faced a single charge under s 6 (c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act involving a corrupt transaction by an agent who knowingly used a false document to deceive his principal in the private sector. For agents in the private sector, whether the imposition of a fine was appropriate or whether the custodial sentence has been crossed was dependent on the level of the accused’s culpability and harm caused in the present case.

32     In determining the appropriate sentence for this charge, I was guided by the High Court decision in _Gan Chai Bee Anne_ that similarly involved an accused with multiple offences who had pleaded guilty to ten charges under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act with the remaining 144 similar charges taken into consideration. On appeal, her original individual sentences that ranged from two weeks’ imprisonment to six weeks’ imprisonment was reduced to one week’s imprisonment for each proceeded charge. Five of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively and her global sentence was five weeks’ imprisonment.

33     I also considered the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution as set out above at \[10\]. In _PP v Lee Yean Wei Winnie_, on appeal the High Court had similarly reduced the individual sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment per charge for 15 proceeded charges to one week’s imprisonment per charge. In _PP v Ravichandran Samikkannu_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 299</span>, the trial judge had similarly imposed a sentence of one week’s imprisonment per charge for each of the five proceeded charges. From the records, I noted that the accused in that case withdrew his appeal against his sentences.

34     In my consideration of the appropriate sentence for this charge, in order to determine his level of culpability, I took into account the role of the accused in the present case. From the facts, it was clear that the accused was an instigator of this scheme to deceive his principal as he had forwarded the said email to a CSO under his charge and had instructed her to update the agent profile in in their system to reflect the purported name change. This facilitated the commission of a further set of offences namely, the 987 cheating charges. This showed that the accused had committed the offence with a significant degree of deliberation and premeditation.

35     At the material time, the accused was a Senior Manager (Freight Management) at CWT who was subsequently promoted to Assistant General Manager in July 2012. His duties included managing a team of CSOs who were in charge of processing clients’ orders, documentation and invoicing, and arranging for payments to vendors. The processing of clients’ orders included contacting freight forwarding companies to book freight space for clients’ cargo. This showed that CWT had reposed a high degree of trust and authority in the accused that he had exploited to benefit his wife’s company. In such circumstances, I found his level of culpability to be moderately high.

36     In terms of the harm caused to his principal, the accused had used the email to initiate the deception of his principal that led to the award of work orders for 987 freight jobs to ETW Logistics from 7 February 2012 to 23 June 2014. The total value of the orders amounted to $634,590.18 of which $223,284.53 represented the benefit to ETW Logistics as this was the profit that they had earned by securing the jobs that they would not otherwise have done. His conduct had thus caused significant harm to his principal and CWT’s freight management process was compromised. In addition, I was mindful that no restitution was made to CWT by the accused.

37     In sentencing the accused, I gave his plea of guilt minimal weight as it was entered late, namely on the first day of the trial and was therefore weak evidence of his remorse. Nevertheless, I took into account the fact that he was a first offender.

38     After a careful consideration the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct, I was of the view that the custodial threshold was crossed and I agreed with the Prosecution that the appropriate sentence was one week’s imprisonment. I noted that the Defence Counsel had not made any submissions on the appropriate sentence for the corruption charge. I next turn to the remaining cheating charges.

#### S 417 of the Penal Code

39     The accused had pleaded guilty to 40 cheating charges out of the 987 charges under s 417 of the Penal Code with 947 charges taken into the consideration in sentencing. In determining the appropriate sentence for the individual cheating charges, I had considered the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution as set out above at \[10\]. The Prosecution had relied on the case of _Idya Nurhazlyn_ to seek sentences ranging from three weeks’ to five weeks’ imprisonment per charge in view of the various amounts involved for each charge. The Defence had not made any submissions in respect of the individual sentences for each cheating charge.

40     I agreed with the Prosecution while the present case was not the usual run-of-the-mill case, it is trite that with financial crimes the most pertinent factor is the quantum. The accused had committed a substantial number of offences over a period of two years and four months from 7 February 2012 to 23 June 2014 involving 987 freight jobs. The CSOs were deceived into awarding the freight jobs to ETW Logistics who made a profit $223,284.53 that they would not otherwise have done. The CSOs were first directed to award the jobs to ETW Logistics and when they raised their concerns about the conflict of interest, they were told by the accused that the requisite declaration had been made to the CEO of CWT.

41     Although, it was the Defence’s case that the CWT freight department had made substantial profits and that the personnel had obtained their increments and bonuses all from the accused’s efforts in setting up the department, this was an unsubstantiated assertion. Furthermore, it was undisputed that there were cases where the freight forwarder had quoted less and hence the loss suffered by CWT was quantifiable.

42     Once again, I was of the view that the accused was similarly not entitled to any sentencing discount for pleading guilty as he had done so only on the first day of the trial and was therefore weak evidence of his remorse. In addition, as no restitution had been made to CWT by the accused, he was not entitled to a downward calibration of his sentences. Nevertheless, I took into account the fact that he was a first offender.

43     Having regard to the totality of the accused’s offending conduct, I was of the view that the custodial threshold was crossed for all the proceeded charges for the reasons as set out above. As the quantum involved was a significant factor in sentencing, I considered the amount involved for the individual charges as well as the substantial number of charges involved when calibrating the individual sentences. I regarded the sentence of one month’s imprisonment for a charge involving $1,800 imposed by the High Court in _Idya Nurhazlyn_ as a starting point and made the appropriate calibration depending on the amounts involved. For the charges involving amounts below $1,000, I had imposed a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment, the charges involving amounts below $2,000, a sentence of one month’s imprisonment and for the charges involving amounts above $2,000 a sentence of two months’ imprisonment.

### Step two – global sentence

44     After having decided on the individual sentences, the next step was to decide on the global sentence. By virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 Rev Ed 2012), when a person is convicted and sentenced for at least three distinct offences, the court must order at least two sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively. The Prosecution had sought a global sentence of at least 20 months’ imprisonment while the Defence had urged the court to impose a global sentence of nine months’ imprisonment. In addition, the Prosecution had submitted that the corruption charge should be ordered to run consecutively as the offences pertained to different legally protected interests.

45     The Prosecution had relied on the case of _Chen Chen Chang_ where the total amount involved was $138,102.50 with full restitution made. The accused there was sentenced to a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. Given the quantum in the present case was higher, the sheer number of charges and accounting for the lack of restitution, it was the Prosecution’s case that a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate calibration.

46     After having regard to the totality of the offender’s conduct, I was of the view that a global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in respect of the cheating charges. In my view a global sentence of nine months’ imprisonment sought by the Defence would not have adequately reflected the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct. I ordered the sentences for 12 charges to run consecutively in order to arrive at the global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment with the remaining charges to run concurrently. As for the corruption charge, as it pertained to a different legally protected interest, I ordered the sentence in DAC-941457-2018 to run consecutively with the 12 cheating charges in DAC-941458-2018, DAC-941618-2018, DAC-941765-2018, DAC-941779-2018, DAC-942118-2018, DAC-942182-2018, DAC-942184-2018, DAC-942224-2018, DAC-942259-2018, DAC-942289-2018, DAC-942405-2018 and DAC-942457-2018.

47     The global sentence imposed was therefore 18 months’ and one week’s imprisonment. In my view, the global sentence was just and appropriate in order to achieve the objective of both general and specific deterrence.

48     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had lodged an appeal against his sentences.
