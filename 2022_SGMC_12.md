Civil Procedure – Delay – Setting aside

14 February 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Theodore Tan:

## Introduction

1       In _U Myo Nyunt (alias Michael Nyunt) v First Property Holdings Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 2 SLR 816</span> (“_U Myo Nyunt_”), the Court of Appeal set out the applicable test for the setting aside of both an interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed entered in default of appearance under O 13 r 2 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), and a judgment obtained at an assessment of damages governed by O 35 r 2 of the ROC. Given that the decision was only handed down last year, it is perhaps unsurprising that there do not appear to have been any written decisions considering its application. The present application affords an interesting opportunity to consider the application of the test in _U Myo Nyunt_ to a situation where a defendant is guilty of significant procedural defaults, but has managed to demonstrate that there are serious concerns with the viability of the plaintiff’s claims.

## Facts

2       I begin by briefly setting out the facts. The present suit arises out of a contract entered into on or about 2 May 2019 between the plaintiff and the first defendant (“the Contract”) for the provision of certain constructions works in relation to a property owned by the plaintiff (“the Property”). The contract was signed on behalf of the first defendant by the second defendant. It suffices to note that the works were not completed.

3       Whether the various steps taken by the plaintiff to bring notice of the proceedings to the second defendant were successful was hotly contested in the hearing of the application. I only briefly set them out here and will consider them in greater detail later on in this judgment.

4       The plaintiff first sent a letter on 20 August 2019 to the first defendant’s then registered address at 13 Kaki Bukit Road 4 (“the Kaki Bukit Address”),[^1] where she had apparently first met the second defendant, and various email addresses associated with the defendants, informing of her engagement of a chartered surveyor to conduct a survey of the Property. This was followed by letters of demand on 3 September 2019 and 24 September 2019.[^2] The final letter of demand was also copied to the addresses of the first defendant’s officers (including the second defendant) as reflected in the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority’s (“ACRA’s”) records.

5       The Writ of Summons against the defendants was issued on 17 January 2020.

6       The claims pleaded against the second defendant in the Statement of Claim include:[^3]

> (a)     Fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation;

> (b)     Piercing of the corporate veil to make him liable for the first defendant’s breaches of contract;

> (c)     Unlawful means conspiracy with the first defendant to cause loss to the plaintiff;

> (d)     Inducing the first defendant to breach its contract with the plaintiff; and

> (e)     Enforcement of a guarantee or undertaking under cl 18 of the Contract in relation to any damages or losses suffered by the plaintiff due to the negligence or wilful default of the first defendant.

7       The Writ of Summons was served on the first defendant at its registered address at 216 Joo Chiat Road (“the Joo Chiat Address”). The Plaintiff applied for and obtained an order for substituted service in respect of the second defendant by post to his last known address at 45A Edgefield Plains (“the Edgefield Address”), which was carried out on 24 February 2020.

8       Interlocutory judgment in default of appearance was entered against the defendants on 11 March 2020 for damages to be assessed (“the Interlocutory Judgment”). Thereafter, the plaintiff proceeded to bring the matter to an assessment of damages, which was heard on 21 May 2021. It appears that in the lead up to the assessment of damages, various letters were sent by the plaintiff to the defendants to keep them apprised of proceedings. The defendants were ultimately adjudged liable to pay the sum of $47,190.86 to the plaintiff, together with interest and costs (“the Assessment Judgment”).

9       Following this, the plaintiff sent a further letter on 4 June 2021 (“the 4 June 2021 Letter”) to the defendants enclosing the judgments.[^4] In respect of the second defendant, the letter was sent to both the Edgefield address and an address at 217A Sumang Walk (“the Sumang Address”). It is not disputed that the second defendant presently resides at the Sumang Address, which belongs to his parents, though he denies seeing this letter. There was no response from the second defendant. The second defendant only appointed his present solicitors and applied to set aside both the Interlocutory Judgment and the Assessment Judgment on 30 November 2021, after bankruptcy proceedings were commenced against him by the plaintiff. This appears to have been prompted by a letter sent by the Ministry of Law to the Sumang Address on 1 September 2021.[^5]

## The Law

10     There was some initial confusion on the applicable legal test to be applied. The parties’ submissions attempted to apply the test set out in _Mercurine Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 907</span> for the setting aside of a default judgment. Both sides subsequently accepted in the hearing before me that the applicable test is that laid out in _U Myo Nyunt_. Under this, the court embarks on a two-stage balancing exercise (_U Myo Nyunt_ at \[74\]):

> (a)     first, it has to identify and assess the seriousness and significance of the defaults and the reasons behind the procedural breaches; and

> (b)     second, it has to balance the considerations in (a) against all other relevant factors, bearing in mind the two competing interests of finality in litigation on the one hand, and the interests of justice in preventing a miscarriage of justice that might be occasioned in denying the relief sought.

11     With these principles in mind, I now turn to apply them to the instant case, addressing the parties’ submissions on the issues where necessary.

## Analysis

### Seriousness and significance of defaults and reasons behind procedural breaches

12     The second defendant’s position is that he only became aware of the proceedings in September 2021 when the letter from the Ministry of Law concerning the bankruptcy proceedings was sent to the Sumang Address, upon which he promptly took out the present application to set aside the Interlocutory Judgment and Assessment Judgment.

13     According to the second defendant, the plaintiff’s attempts to bring the proceedings to his attention were unsuccessful for a number of reasons:

> (a)     First, he was not residing at the Edgefield Address in February 2020 when service was effected pursuant to the substituted service order. While this was his residential address in ACRA’s records, he had in fact moved in August 2019 to live with his parents at the Sumang Address owing to marital problems with his wife, who refuses to communicate with him.[^6]

> (b)     Second, while service was effected on the first defendant at its registered office at the Joo Chiat Address, the Joo Chiat Address had been tenanted out by that time and the first defendant was operating out of the Kaki Bukit Address.[^7]

> (c)     Third, he did not receive any of the letters sent to his personal email as he was constantly travelling from 31 July 2019 to 21 January 2020 and had limited access to email. His work emails had also been deactivated on or around August 2019.[^8]

> (d)     Fourth, he was not on talking terms with any of the first defendant’s other directors and any correspondence sent to them would not have been shared with him.[^9]

> (e)     Fifth, the letter sent by the plaintiff to the Sumang Address annexing the Interlocutory and Assessment Judgments did not reach him as he did not have access to the letterbox and was not informed by his elderly parents.[^10]

14     The plaintiff’s position, unsurprisingly, is that the second defendant’s explanations should be rejected as he has provided little to no evidence on the alleged reasons for being unaware of the proceedings. The plaintiff contends that the second defendant was aware of the proceedings from the beginning and deliberately chose not to take part.[^11]

15     In my judgment, the second defendant was aware of the present proceedings long before the Ministry of Law’s letter was sent to him in September 2021, but for reasons best known to himself elected not to participate. The mere fact that the second defendant’s explanations have been put on affidavit does not mean that the court is bound to accept them unquestioningly. To my mind, the alleged chain of coincidences (see \[13\] above) that operated to render the second defendant unaware of the present proceedings from their commencement in January 2020 till September 2021 despite the plaintiff’s efforts to keep him informed is so incredible and unsupported by the evidence that it must be rejected.

16     The second defendant’s affidavits in many respects consists of little more than bare assertions, even where it would have been fairly easy to obtain and exhibit supporting evidence. This is of particular importance in the present matter given the long delay for which an explanation is required.

17     The second defendant first lays the blame on his wife for not informing him of the proceedings after he allegedly moved out of the Edgefield Address in August 2019. Given the seriousness of the matter to the second defendant with the pending bankruptcy proceedings, one would expect some attempt at eliciting an explanation as to why the various letters sent by the plaintiff and substituted service of the writ of summons were not brought to his intention (whether as a result of the deliberate actions of his wife or otherwise). This strangely does not appear to have been done.

18     The second defendant next says that the other directors of the first defendant, who are his family members, may have received correspondence addressed to the first defendant but did not share them with him as they were no longer on talking terms. While I do not presume to know how an unhappy family would act in this situation (they are after all, in Tolstoy’s words, unhappy in their own way), one would again expect someone in the second defendant’s position to make attempts to find out why none of the documents sent to the first defendant were ever brought to his attention, if indeed that were truly the case. This is all the more so since the first defendant still appears to be a live company. Again, nothing was produced in the second defendant’s affidavits to support his assertions.

19     The second defendant thirdly claims that he did not receive the 4 June 2021 Letter sent to the Sumang Address as he did not have access to the letter box and was dependent on his elderly parents to inform him of any letters addressed to him. Yet, he somehow had sight of the Ministry of Law’s letter on 1 September 2021. Did the 4 June 2021 Letter ever reach the Sumang Address? Did someone deliberately prevent him from seeing it? Where did it go? These are all crucial questions that the second defendant ought to have addressed in his affidavits but failed to do so.

20     Even where the second defendant does provide evidence, this falls woefully short of supporting his explanations. The second defendant claims he was unable to access any emails sent to his personal email account as he was constantly traveling from 31 July 2019 to 21 January 2020. Yet, the photos of his passport tendered tell a different story.[^12] It appears that the second defendant’s longest trip was to China between October 2019 and December 2019. He also appears to have gone to Hong Kong in January 2020, though it is unclear when he returned. Apart from this, the rest of the trips were all short, with some even comprising day trips to Malaysia. Against this backdrop, I find it unbelievable that the second defendant was entirely unaware of the various emails that were sent to him by the plaintiff both before and after the commencement of proceedings in January 2020. Moreover, the second defendant’s travels do not explain how he could have remained unaware of the emails since his return; emails do not simply disappear if you do not access them shortly after they are received.

21     Viewing the evidence in its totality, I am unable to accept the second defendant’s explanations for failing to enter an appearance and contest the present proceedings. Rather, I am of the view that the second defendant was aware from early 2020 that the plaintiff had taken out the instant suit against him and the first defendant but intentionally chose not to take part in proceedings. This was an extremely serious default which has resulted in considerable expenditure on the plaintiff’s part, which would be wasted if the Interlocutory Judgment and Assessment Judgment are set aside.

### Balancing the relevant considerations

22     I now turn to the second stage of the test set out in _U Myo Nyunt_ (see \[10\] above). The second defendant’s position on this score consists of two arguments. First, that there would be no prejudice to the plaintiff if the Interlocutory Judgment and Assessment Judgment against him were set aside as she could still enforce them against the first defendant. Second, that there are triable issues in respect of the various claims brought by the plaintiff against him.

23     The plaintiff, on the other hand, takes the position that the Interlocutory Judgment and Assessment Judgment should not be set aside even if there are triable issues as the second defendant has deliberately chosen not to take part in proceedings for over a year and a half despite having been aware of them.

24     The first point can be easily disposed of. The second defendant cannot simply say that there is no prejudice since the judgments can be enforced against the first defendant. No authority has been cited for such a proposition. In any event, there is nothing to show that the judgments can or have been satisfied out of the first defendant’s assets. To my mind, having recourse to the second defendant’s assets would be of importance to someone in the plaintiff’s position as it increases the chances of the judgments being satisfied.

25     The second point requires a consideration of the plaintiff’s claims against the second defendant in order to determine whether there are any triable issues. In my view, there are clearly triable issues and I would go so far as to say that the plaintiff’s claims can in certain respects be described as speculative. I explain why I have reached this conclusion with reference to the various heads of claim (see \[6\] above).

#### Whether there are triable issues

##### (1)   Misrepresentation

26     The plaintiff contends that there are no triable issues in respect of its claim for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. The plaintiff’s submissions focus on reasons which allegedly make the intended defence of the second defendant untenable,[^13] but this is only one side of the coin. The plaintiff must still show that there are no triable issues in respect of its pleaded claim against the second defendant.

27     The plaintiff’s claim is based on the following eight alleged representations set out in paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim:

> a.    That the 1st Defendant is a reputable company and known for good quality work and prompt and efficient services;

> b.    That the 1st Defendant is accredited by CaseTrust and has a good business practice;

> c.    That the 1st Defendant had the ability and capability to deliver a top quality renovation and design works;

> d.    That the 1st Defendant had the ability and capability to complete any design and renovation works within a reasonable agreed timeline, i.e. for some works to be completed by 22 July 2019 and the rest by the end of August 2019;

> e.    That the 1st Defendant owns a workshop and employs its own workers to ensure a timely delivery without compromising a high quality of works;

> f.    That the 2nd Defendant would personally supervise the design and renovation works;

> g.    That the 1st and 2nd Defendants had the ability and capability to ensure all the design, dimension, and specification would conform to the geomancy specific requirements and/or any space constraints (“Geomancy and/or Space Constraint Requirements), where applicable;

> h.    That the design, dimension and specification would conform to the Geomancy and/or Space Constraint Requirements.

28     In this regard, the only real evidence that the plaintiff has provided in support of its claim is the fact that the agreed upon works were subsequently not completed. As a starting point, both fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation require that there be a false representation of fact: see _Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 435</span> at \[14\]. Looking at the alleged representations, it is evident that even on the assumption that they were made, the fact that the works were subsequently not completed, while relevant, is insufficient to show that there are no triable issues in respect of whether they were false. The link between the failure to complete the works and some of the alleged representations is so tenuous that a trial is clearly called for such that the issues can be properly ventilated.

##### (2)   Corporate veil

29     The plaintiff’s claim to pierce the corporate veil and hold the second defendant liable for the first defendant’s breaches of contract lies on even shakier foundations. It appears from the plaintiff’s submissions that it is relying on the alter ego ground for this claim, making reference to the fact that the second defendant was the “controlling mind” of the first defendant and that all communications the plaintiff had were with him.[^14]

30     I am of course bound by the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 308</span> (“_Alwie Handoyo_”) which held that the alter ego ground exists, notwithstanding any doubts raised by the UK Supreme Court’s decision in _Prest v Petrodel_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 AC 415</span>. In any case, applying the formulation set out for the alter ego ground in _Alwie Handoyo_ at \[96\], I arrive at the conclusion that there are triable issues. The alter ego ground requires evidence that the company is carrying on the business of its controller. Matters such as whether a company’s controller treated its assets as if they were his or her own are highly relevant. Here, there is no evidence whatsoever of the second defendant doing so. In fact, he was only a 25% shareholder of the first defendant at the material time. The fact that the second defendant was the primary point of contact with the plaintiff does not mean that he controlled the first defendant in all other respects. While it is not my place to make any findings of fact in this interlocutory application, it seems to me on the affidavit evidence that the plaintiff’s claim on this ground is best described as speculative.

##### (3)   Unlawful means conspiracy and inducement of breach of contract

31     The plaintiff’s next two contentions can be addressed together. Counsel for the plaintiff in oral submissions took the position that the Court of Appeal’s decision in _PT Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 818</span>, which held that a director is not personally liable for breaches of their company if their acts _qua_ director were not in breach of any fiduciary or other personal legal duties owed to the company, does not apply to a cause of action in negligence. The thrust of this confusing submission appears to be that a director can be held personally liable in an unlawful means conspiracy with his company to commit negligence. But how can that be the case? A cause of action in negligence is premised on inadvertence, while the very essence of a conspiracy is that it involves a series of deliberate acts. No authority was cited to me for this proposition and I unhesitatingly reject it. In so far as the claim for inducement of breach of contract is concerned, the statement of claim does not plead what fiduciary duties owed to the first defendant were breached by the second defendant, and this does not appear to have been addressed in the plaintiff’s submissions. There are clearly triable issues on these claims.

##### (4)   Guarantee or undertaking

32     The plaintiff’s final claim is premised on the fact that the second defendant had guaranteed or undertaken responsibility for any damages or losses caused due to the negligence or wilful default of the first defendant. This was based on cl 18 of the Contract, which was signed by the second defendant on the first defendant’s behalf. Before me, counsel for the plaintiff candidly accepted that there were triable issues on whether this clause binds the second defendant personally. I would go further to say that the argument appears contrived and fanciful; there is nothing in the Contract that indicates to me that the second defendant was to become a party to its terms when signing it on the first defendant’s behalf in his capacity as its director.

33     To be clear, the views I have expressed in this judgment are based entirely on the affidavit evidence. The plaintiff may very well prevail at trial on all of its claims after discovery and other processes have been completed. That is a matter for the trial judge and I need not say more.

#### Whether the Interlocutory Judgment and Assessment Judgment should be set aside

34     In the final analysis, I am confronted with a situation where the second defendant’s deliberate failure to take part in proceedings must be weighed against the fact that he has more than demonstrated a _prima facie_ defence against the plaintiff’s claims. In my view, the balance of equities leans in favour of setting aside the Interlocutory Judgment and Assessment Judgment.

35     Counsel for the plaintiff argued before me that the facts of the present case are analogous to _U Myo Nyunt_. I do not agree. In that case, the appellant was served process in Australia where he resided but deliberately chose not to enter an appearance upon seeking legal advice, which resulted in a default judgment being entered against him in January 2016, followed by an assessment of damages for $66m in favour of the respondent in November 2016. At around the same time, the appellant also commenced parallel proceedings in Myanmar. When the respondent registered the Singapore judgments in Australia in March 2017, the appellant unsuccessfully applied to challenge their registration. It was only in August 2019 that he applied to the High Court to set aside the service order and the judgments. The High Court set aside a small part of the default judgment for a liquidated sum of US$585,143.67 as it was likely time-barred, but refused the rest of the appellant’s application, leading to the appeal before the Court of Appeal.

36     In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal found that the appellant’s failure to participate in the Singapore proceedings was part of a deliberate litigation strategy as he had been advised that a Singapore judgment could not be enforced in Myanmar. He was waging parallel proceedings in Myanmar and further only brought the application to set aside some three and a half years after the default judgment. Even though there were merits to the intended defence, which raised triable issues, it would be wrong to allow the appellant to ignore reality and come back to contest the case.

37     It is readily apparent that the appellant’s defaults in _U Myo Nyunt_ were far more serious than those of the second defendant in the present case. Not only did the appellant engage in parallel proceedings in Myanmar, he also sought to challenge the registration of the Singapore judgments in Australia. It was only when those attempts proved futile that he chose to come to Singapore to contest the respondent’s claims, some three and a half years later. In spite of this, I would note that the High Court still chose to set aside part of the default judgment concerning a claim which appeared to be time barred: see _First Property Holdings Pte Ltd v U Myo Nyunt (Alias Michael Nyunt)_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 276</span> at \[62\]. There was no appeal against this part of the High Court’s decision.

38     Here, while the second defendant’s procedural breaches certainly cannot be condoned, they do not rise to the level of the appellant in _U Myo Nyunt_. Given that I have found that the second defendant has amply demonstrated triable issues in respect of the plaintiff’s claims, with some of them even appearing to be speculative (see \[26\]–\[32\] above), I am of the view that the Interlocutory Judgment and Assessment Judgment ought to be set aside. The need to prevent a miscarriage of justice outweighs the interests of finality in litigation in this case. In so far as there is any prejudice caused to the plaintiff, this can be amply compensated with an appropriate award of costs.

## Conclusion

39     For these reasons, I set aside the Interlocutory Judgment and the Assessment Judgment. I will hear parties separately on costs and consequential directions.
