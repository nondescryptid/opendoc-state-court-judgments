\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9121/2022/01.\]

13 July 2022

### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Nicholas Tan Siew Chye, male 26 years old, pleaded guilty to two counts of operating equipment to take upskirt videos. The charges, in date sequence, were as follows:-

> **2nd Charge (Amended) (MAC-905023-2021)**

> are charged that you, on 19 October 2020, at around 6pm, at \[name of hall redacted\] Hall of Nanyang Technological University, located at \[address redacted\], Singapore, did operate equipment without the consent of one V1 \[victim’s name redacted\], (“the victim”), with the intention of enabling yourself to observe the victim’s covered genitals, in circumstances where her underwear would not otherwise be visible, namely, you used your mobile phone to take an upskirt video from underneath her dress, knowing that the victim did not consent to your operating the equipment with that intention, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 377BB(4) p/u 377BB(7) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **1st Charge (Amended) (MAC 904870-2021)**

> are charged that you, on 25 February 2021, at around 4.30pm, at the lift at \[block number redacted\] Canberra Road, did operate equipment without the consent of one V2 \[name of victim redacted\] (“the victim”), with the intention of enabling yourself to observe the victim’s covered genitals, in circumstances where her underwear would not otherwise be visible, namely, you used your mobile phone to take an upskirt video from underneath her skirt, knowing that the victim did not consent to your operating the equipment with that intention, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 377BB(4) p/u 377BB(7) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       One further charge of criminal trespass at \[name of hall redacted\] Hall, Nanyang Technological University (“NTU”), which was related to the second charge, was taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purposes of sentencing.

3       The accused was sentenced to consecutive sentences of three weeks’ imprisonment for the second charge and four weeks’ imprisonment for the first charge, giving an aggregate of seven weeks’ imprisonment. He has filed an appeal against sentence and is on bail pending appeal.

## Statement of Facts

4       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification:-

**Statement of Facts**

**(MAC-904870-2021 and MAC-905023-2021)**

> 1.    The accused is Nicholas Tan Siew Chye, male, 25 years old, Singaporean citizen bearing NRIC no. xxxx941H. He is a student in Nanyang Technological University (“NTU”).

> **A**.     **Facts relating to 2nd Charge (MAC-905023-2021)**

> 2.    The complainant is Mohammad Izwan bin Ibrahim, an investigation officer working at NTU. On 20 October 2020 at around 11am, the complainant called “999” stating “detained a subject for taking upskirt photos”. The location was given as NTU.

> 3.    The victim is V2 \[name redacted\], female, Singaporean. She was 20 years old at the time of the offence and studying and living in NTU.

> 4.    On 19 October 2020 at around 6pm, the accused was visiting his girlfriend at \[name of hall redacted\] Hall of NTU, located at \[address redacted\], Singapore. He was in her room on level 6 and decided to meet her after class. He thus went down to level 1. The victim also stayed in the Hall and was walking back to her room. She was wearing a red dress. The accused spotted the victim when they were both at level 1. The accused decided to follow her as she walked up to the lift lobby on level 3. When the victim was at the lift lobby on level 3 waiting for the lift, the accused took out his mobile phone intending to take an upskirt photo of the victim. He switched his phone camera on to video mode and squatted down, placing his phone under the victim’s dress with the camera aimed up her dress and recording an upskirt video. The victim did not consent to this and the accused knew that the victim did not consent.

> 5.    The victim felt someone moving closer to her from behind and turned. The accused immediately moved back from his squatting position, which the victim saw. The victim was shocked and did not communicate with the accused. She then left the lobby as she was worried for her safety if she took the lift and the accused entered with her. The accused then deleted the video from his phone. The victim reported the matter to campus security later that day.

> 6.    The accused’s identity was established through CCTV footage and the complainant approached the accused to assist with investigations. The complainant then called the police.

> 7.    The accused was arrested on 20 October 2020 and released on police bail the next day.

> **B**.     **Facts relating to 1st Charge (MAC-904870-2021)**

> 8.    The victim is V1 \[name redacted\], female, Singaporean, 17 years old at the time of the offence. On 25 February 2021 at around 5.40pm, the victim lodged a report at Sembawang Neighbourhood Police Centre stating that she felt that someone had touched her inner right thigh and molested her. The location was given as \[address redacted\].

> 9.    On 25 February 2021 at around 4.30pm, the victim was returning home from school. She resided at \[address redacted\]. She was wearing her school uniform, which was a t-shirt and skirt. The accused was also returning home to 300 Canberra Road and had parked his car at the multistorey car park. The accused spotted the victim on his way home and noticed that she was wearing a skirt. He felt the urge to take an upskirt video of her and followed her from the entrance of the car park to the lift lobby of \[address redacted\]. He stood next to the victim at the lift lobby.

> 10.    When the lift arrived, the victim entered the lift and the accused followed. The victim selected the 12th floor and the accused selected the 15th floor. While the lift was going up, the accused set his mobile phone to video recording mode. When the victim arrived at her level and was about to head out of the lift, the accused squatted down and stretched out his arm with his phone camera towards the victim’s thigh area, intending to take an upskirt video. The victim felt the accused touch her thigh and turned back and shouted “oi”. The victim was out of the lift at this point. The accused did not respond but raised his hands in apology.

> 11.    When the accused reached the 15th floor, he took the stairs down to the ground floor and went home. The victim called her father about the incident and started crying. Her parents then tried to search for the accused but could not find him. The victim’s mother brought her to lodge a police report at Sembawang Neighbourhood Police Centre that afternoon.

> 12.    The accused had intended to take an upskirt video of the victim without her consent. The accused knew that the victim did not consent. The accused had intended to view the video after taking it before deleting it but deleted the video without viewing it when he was caught in the act by the victim.

> 13.    The accused’s identity was established through CCTV footage. He was on police bail at the time of the offence. He was arrested on 1 March 2021.

> **C**.     **Conclusion**

> 14.    On both occasions, the accused operated equipment, namely his mobile phone, without the victims’ consent, and with the intention of enabling the accused to observe the victims’ genitals in circumstances where their underwear would not otherwise be visible. The accused knew that the victims did not consent to the accused operating the phone with that intention. The accused thus committed two counts of an offence under s 377BB(4) p/u (7) of the Penal Code on 19 October 2020 and 25 February 2021.

> 15.    The accused admits to the offences and stands charged.

## Consideration of sentence

### Mandatory treatment was not recommended

5       In his medical report dated 12 August 2021, the defence psychiatrist Dr Lim Chee Chong Lionel, a consultant psychiatrist at LP Clinic Pte Ltd stated that the accused suffered from voyeuristic disorder. I called for a psychiatric report to assess his suitability for a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”).

6       The appointed psychiatrist, Dr Amelia Sim Peiling, Consultant, Institute of Mental Health, stated in her report dated 22 February 2022 that she was not recommending an MTO as she did not find any evidence of a psychiatric disorder in the accused. In view of her report, the court could not make an MTO since ss 339(3) and (4) of the Criminal Procedure Code provide:-

> (3)    A court may make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender only if the report submitted by an appointed psychiatrist states that —

>> (a)    the offender is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment;

>> (b)    the offender is suitable for the treatment; and

>> (c)    the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for his or her committing the offence.

> (4)    A court must not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender if the report submitted by the appointed psychiatrist states that the appointed psychiatrist is not satisfied with any of the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a) to (c).

7       Notwithstanding these provisions, the defence challenged the report of the appointed psychiatrist. It contended that although an MTO could not be made because of Dr Sim’s opinion, it was still open for the defence to assert in mitigation that the accused suffered from voyeuristic disorder which caused or contributed to his offending. A two-day Newton hearing was then fixed to determine if the accused suffered from the disorder, and if so, whether it caused or contributed to the commission of his offences.

8       However, on the first day of hearing, the defence made the following concession:-

**PP v Nicholas Tan Siew Chye**

Parties’ agreement on the issues

> 1.    The Defence confirms that its mitigation will not rely on the accused’s voyeuristic disorder (if any) causing or contributing to the offences.

> 2.    In the circumstances, the parties agree that a Newton hearing is not required.

9       There was thus no need for a Newton hearing to be conducted.

### Sentencing principles

10     The prescribed punishment for an offence punishable under s377BB(7) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) is a term of imprisonment which may extend to 2 years or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

11     The prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 8 to 12 weeks’ imprisonment. The initial position taken by the defence was that if probation or mandatory treatment could not be considered, the appropriate sentence would be a term of imprisonment of not more than four weeks.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) It subsequently changed its position and submitted for the imposition of a fine.[^2]

12     The dominant sentencing principle for upskirt video cases is deterrence. A clear message must be sent to the accused and other like-minded offenders that stiff deterrence sentences will be imposed for their perverse acts. As Chan Seng Onn, J stated in _Public Prosecutor v Chong Hou En_ \[2015\] SGH 69 (_“Chong Hou En”_) at \[65\]:-

> 65    Both general and specific deterrence are principles which should feature in the final sentence to be meted out. For the reasons submitted by the Prosecution (see above at \[15\]), I am in agreement that general deterrence is particularly relevant. Given the fact that mobile phones with camera functions are now ubiquitous and that cameras with recording functions come in all shapes, sizes and disguises and are getting cheaper to acquire, the perverse now find it easier to prey on unsuspecting women almost anywhere.

13     Specific deterrence was also a relevant sentencing consideration. Chan, J stated at \[66\]:-

> 66    Specific deterrence is also relevant given that I have found that voyeurism merely represents a descriptive label for a perverse behavioural option and that it does not deprive the person diagnosed of his self-control.

14     As the accused re-offended while he was on bail, some measure of specific deterrence was also called for.

15     The contention by the defence that rehabilitation was the primary sentencing consideration had no merit. The accused was not a youthful offender. He was 24 years old when he committed the offences and was well into adulthood. He was a final year student at NTU and had served national service in a leadership position.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) He would thus be sufficiently mature. He was a recalcitrant offender who re-offended while he was on bail. His alleged disorder did not cause or contribute to his offences. There was nothing exceptional about this case and there was no reason for rehabilitation to displace deterrence as the primary sentencing consideration.

### Aggravating factors

16     Several aggravating factors were present for the second charge. The accused spotted the victim and followed her from level 1 of Tamarind Hall, NTU to the lift lobby at level 3, where he switched his phone camera to video mode and placed it under the victim’s dress. There was thus an element of stalking, planning and pre-meditation. The offence occurred at the victim’s place of residence where she had the right to feel safe from predators like the accused. In so offending, the accused committed criminal trespass, which was the subject matter of the TIC charge.

17     The aggravating factors for the first charge were more severe. The accused re-offended while he was on police bail. There was also an element of stalking, planning and pre-meditation. He spotted and targeted a 17 year-old girl who was in her school uniform and followed her from the car park to her block. It was aggravating that the offence was committed in a lift. The victim was distressed and cried when she spoke to her father.

### Mitigating factors

18     In sentencing the accused, I considered the factors raised in the plea-in-mitigation. He had no antecedents. He was remorseful as shown by his early plea of guilt and his efforts at rehabilitation. He had good family support.

19     I could not attribute any mitigating weight to the defence psychiatrist’s diagnosis that the accused had voyeuristic disorder since this did not cause or contribute to his offending. Nonetheless, I considered his efforts to seek psychiatric treatment as an indication of his genuine remorse and desire to change. He had attended many sessions with his psychiatrist and psychotherapist, who were happy with his progress.

### Calibration of sentence

20     Due to the need for deterrence and the presence of aggravating factors, the custodial threshold had been crossed. The imposition of a fine would not be an adequate punishment and would make light of the fact that serious offences had been committed against young women. The accused’s efforts at rehabilitation did not displace the need for deterrence nor did it indicate that a fine should be imposed, especially since the purported disorder he was being treated for did not cause or contribute to his offending.

21     For the second charge, given the aggravating factors present, the starting point would be a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment. As the accused was remorseful, as demonstrated by his plea of guilt and attempts at rehabilitation, I calibrated this downwards to three weeks’ imprisonment.

22     For the first charge, an uplift in sentence was called for as the accused re-offended while he was on bail. Further, the offence took place in a lift, albeit when the victim was about to head out of it. The starting point would be six weeks’ imprisonment. Taking into account the mitigating factors and totality of sentence, I calibrated sentence downwards to four weeks’ imprisonment.

23     As the offences were separate and distinct, I ordered both sentences to run consecutively, so that the accused would serve a total of seven weeks’ imprisonment.

24     In passing sentence, I placed full weight on the accused’s efforts at rehabilitation by factoring in a substantial sentencing discount. This did not mean that a fine was appropriate, since his rehabilitation could continue in prison and even after that. As Chan J stated in _Chong Hou En_ at \[67\]:-

> … There is similarly no suggestion here that rehabilitation cannot take place in prison and continue even after imprisonment. Therefore, even though rehabilitation is a relevant sentencing principle, it does not automatically mandate a lighter sentence. However, particular care must be taken when the global sentence imposed is calibrated such that it is not such a crushing sentence that may destroy any hope of recovery and reintegration of the respondent.

25     The sentence imposed was not crushing. The individual sentences were much lighter when compared to that meted out in _Public Prosecutor v Mark Fritz Tanel_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGMC 26</span> for a similar offence. In that case, the offender who was a student at the Singapore Institute of Management, followed the victim up an escalator in a shopping centre and took an upskirt video. He was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment for this offence.

26     The aggregate sentence of seven weeks’ imprisonment would in totality be just and proportional and is not manifestly excessive.
