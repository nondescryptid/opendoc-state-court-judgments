### District Judge Koo Zhi Xuan:

## Introduction

1       When a property of a person is seized by a law enforcement agency (“LEA”) in the course of investigations, and the LEA wishes to continue seizing the property for more than a year, the LEA has to make a report to a Magistrate’s Court (“MC”) and satisfy the MC that the property is still “relevant for the purposes of investigation” _etc_, as required under s 370(3)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). At its core, the duty of the MC in these proceedings is to balance the need of a LEA to further retain seized properties for the purposes of investigation or future prosecution, and the presumption of innocence applying in favour of persons whose properties have been seized. Judicial oversight exists to ensure that persons who have not been charged in court, let alone convicted of an offence, “should not be deprived of their property except in accordance with the law” (_Rajendar Prasad Rai and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 796</span> at \[39\]). In the present case, the Respondents (three individual shareholders of a Singapore incorporated company) objected to the application of the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force (“CAD”) to continue seizing a bank account containing more than USD $16 million (“the Funds”) a year after the Funds were seized, which the Respondents claimed they were beneficial owners of.

2       The central issue which has arisen in this case is a novel one: to justify the continued seizure of property, does the Prosecution have to satisfy the MC that its interpretation of the suspected offence purportedly being investigated is defensible in law? The issue as framed is novel because no court has specifically considered and ruled on it. Yet the absence of such a ruling does not mean that the law is silent on what the correct answer is. In my judgment, when the _principles_ underlying the s 370 CPC framework and the various judicial decisions that have shed light on s 370 CPC are considered, the law yields a demonstrably clear and just answer to the issue at hand: the Prosecution has to satisfy the MC that there exists a reasonable basis for its interpretation of the suspected offence.

3       As the Prosecution failed to satisfy me that there exists a reasonable basis for its interpretation of the stated suspected offence purportedly being investigated in this case, I was not satisfied that the Funds seized by CAD were relevant for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under any written law. Accordingly, on 3 March 2021, I issued an oral judgment ordering that the Funds seized by CAD be returned to the person entitled to possession, in accordance with s 370(2)(e)(i) of the CPC. I now set out the full grounds of my decision.

## Facts and procedural history

### The background facts

4       The Respondents in this matter (Benito Aloria Yap, the late Guai Lian Phuay, and Manfred Low Cheng Jing) are shareholders of Yuk Tung Energy Pte Ltd (“YTE”), a company incorporated in Singapore which at the material time was in the business of oil trading.

5       Under a written contract dated 5 January 2018, YTE purchased gasoil from Petchem International Trading and Shipping Pte Ltd (“Petchem”) for US$15.8 million. Between 10 January 2018 and 23 January 2018, YTE transferred US$15.8 million to Petchem, which constitutes the subject matter of this dispute, _ie_ the Funds prior to the accrued interest earned.

6       Between 24 to 25 January 2018, international news outlets reported the alleged ship-to-ship transfer of gasoil from MT Yuk Tung (a vessel operated by YTE) to MT Rye Song Gang 1, a vessel controlled by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

7       On 26 January 2018, after Petchem learnt of the news reports that MT Yuk Tung was suspected of engaging in the ship-to-ship transfer of gasoil with MT Rye Song Gang 1, Petchem decided not to carry out the transfer of the gasoil to YTE. Petchem also did not return the Funds to YTE.

8       On 30 March 2018, YTE was added to the United Nations Security Council’s 1718 Sanctions List of individuals and entities, by virtue of which it became a “designated person” subject to sanctions under the United Nations (Sanctions – Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations 2010 (S 570/2010) (“UN-DPRK Regs”). Reg 9 of the UN-DPRK Regs (“Reg 9”) states as follows:

>     No person in Singapore and no citizen of Singapore outside Singapore shall deal, directly or indirectly, in any property, funds or other financial assets or economic resources that are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of –

>> (a)    a designated person;

>> (b)    any entity owned or controlled by a designated person; or

>> (c)    any individual or entity who acts on behalf of or under the direction of a designated person, including funds derived or generated from such property.

9       On 18 June 2018, the Respondents commenced a civil suit in the High Court, _ie_, Suit No 617 of 2018 (“Suit 617”), in their personal capacities as shareholders of YTE against Petchem for the return of the Funds. The Respondent’s suit was premised on the existence of a resulting _Quistclose_ trust, _ie_, that they had loaned monies to YTE for a specific purpose (_ie_, to trade in oil) which had failed, and they therefore had a proprietary interest in the Funds.

10     On 4 October 2018, the High Court heard the Respondents’ interlocutory applications for: (a) a summary judgment under Order 14 of the Rules of Court against Petchem; and (b) an injunction to restrain Petchem from using the Funds. The High Court gave Petchem unconditional leave to defend Suit 617. It also granted the injunction sought by the Respondents which restrained Petchem from dealing with, transferring, encumbering, diminishing or otherwise disposing of the Funds until the conclusion of Suit 617.

11     Between 4 October to 31 October 2018, Petchem’s counsel sought clarifications from CAD as to whether CAD had any objections to Petchem resolving the matter with the Respondents on a without prejudice and without any admission of liability basis, which may include paying the Funds to the Respondents. CAD replied to these letters stating that they were “unable to comment on whether \[the Funds were\] required for the purpose of \[CAD’s\] investigations”, but CAD also brought to Petchem’s attention “its obligations under Regulation 9 of the \[UN-DPRK Regs\]”.

12     On 22 February 2019, Petchem filed an interpleader summons to seek the High Court’s direction to dispose of and/or deal with the Funds. A director of Petchem filed an affidavit stating that Petchem has “no intention of keeping or using” the Funds but its concern with returning the Funds (whether to YTE or the Respondents) was that “it would be in breach of \[Reg 9\] of the \[UN-DPRK Regs\]”.

13     In response, CAD filed an affidavit dated 25 March 2019 (“CAD’s affidavit dated 25 March 2019”) which stated the following:

> (a)     The interpleader summons is without factual or legal basis and should be dismissed;

> (b)     Payment of the Funds to the Respondents would contravene Reg 9 and Reg 10 of the UN-DPRK Regs;

> (c)     Given that the Respondents’ claim to the Funds were already before the Court in Suit 617, the evidential and legal issues relating to the claim, including any defence of illegality to be raised by Petchem should be fully ventilated and decided by the Court in Suit 617 instead of via the interpleader summons; and

> (d)     CAD accepts that it would be appropriate for the Funds to be paid into Court pursuant to an order of Court, pending resolution of the dispute to Suit 617.

14     On 24 April 2019, the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”) filed HC/SUM 2110/2019 in Suit 617, seeking leave to intervene should the High Court find that a trust was created over the Funds for the benefit of the Respondents. The AGC was prepared to make written submissions before the High Court on:

> (a)     the underlying public policy sought to be achieved by the UN-DPRK Regs; and

> (b)     whether payment of the Funds to the Respondents would contravene and/or undermine the underlying public policy of the UN-DPRK Regs.

15     On 10 May 2019, just 3 days before the trial of Suit 617 was due to commence, CAD seized the Funds which were in the bank account of Petchem pursuant to section 35 of the CPC.

16     Upon being notified of this act by CAD, the Respondents applied for leave to discontinue Suit 617. On 13 May 2019, the High Court granted the Respondents leave to discontinue Suit 617 “without prejudice to \[the Respondents’\] and/or \[Petchem’s\] rights to make any future claims against each other”.

### The s 370 CPC Report

17     On 9 May 2020, CAD filed a report pursuant to section 370(1)(b) of the CPC (“the s 370 CPC Report”) seeking an order from the MC to permit the continued retention of the Funds by CAD because “CAD’s investigations are currently ongoing”. CAD also applied to redact certain portions of the s 370 CPC Report. In accordance with the procedure set out in _Mustafa Ahunbay v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 903</span> (“_Mustafa Ahunbay_”) at \[81\], I heard the Prosecution in an _ex parte_ hearing on 26 June 2020 and allowed the redaction of certain portions of the s 370 CPC Report before ordering that the redacted report be released to the Respondents.

18     The relevant portions of the redacted s 370 CPC Report are reproduced as follows:

>      **REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 370 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE (Chapter 68, 2012 Revised Edition)**

>     …

> 2    This is the first report filed with the Magistrate’s Court in connection with the following sum of USD 15.8 million and its accrued interests (the “Seized Sum”) by CAD … as required under Section 370(1)(b) of the CPC.

> 3    CAD’s investigations are currently ongoing. CAD is applying for the following:

>> (a)    to retain and deal with the Seized Sum as CAD deems fit for the purpose of investigations; and

>> (b)    to adjourn the matter until investigations are complete, and the suspects in the case are charged in court, or within 12 months, whichever is earlier.

>      **CAD’s investigations and seizure of the items**

> 4.    CAD is investigating into possible offences under Regulation 5(a) and Regulation 9(a) of the United Nations (Sanctions – Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations 2010 (“UN-DPRK Regs”) punishable under Section 5 of the United Nations Act (Chapter 339) committed by Yuk Tung Energy and/or its officers. The directors of Yuk Tung Energy are Benito Aloria Yap (“Benito”), (Philippines citizen, Passport No. \[…\]) and Manfred Low Cheng Jing (“Manfred”), Singapore citizen, NRIC No. \[…\]).

>      _Reg 5(a) UN-DPRK Regs_

> 5.    Yuk Tung Energy owns and operates Marine Tanker Yuk Tung (“MT Yuk Tung”). CAD received information that in January 2018, MT Yuk Tung had supplied oil to a North Korean flagged vessel, MT Rye Song Gang 1 in the East China Sea. MT Rye Song Gang 1 is listed by the United Nations Security Council (“UNSC”) as a sanctioned vessel on 28 December 2017.

> 6.    As a result of the above information, the UNSC designated both Yuk Tung Energy and MT Yuk Tung on its sanctions list on 30 March 2018.

>      _Reg 9 UN-DPRK Regs_

> 7.    Sometime in January 2018, MT Yuk Tung was expecting a delivery of gasoil from Petchem International Trading and Shipping Pte Ltd (“Petchem”) pursuant to a contract between Petchem and Yuk Tung. However, resulting from the above allegations against MT Yuk Tung which was widely reported, Petchem did not deliver gasoil as per its contract with Yuk Tung Energy. This was despite Petchem having received advance payments totalling USD 15.8 million from Yuk Tung Energy.

> 8.    The three shareholders of Yuk Tung Energy, namely Manfred, Benito and Guai Lian Phuay subsequently commenced legal proceedings against Petchem for the advance payments made by Yuk Tung Energy (ref. HC/S 617/2018). The civil suit was filed in their individual capacities as shareholders instead of on behalf of the company, Yuk Tung Energy. In their affidavits, the shareholders claimed that they lent the USD 15.8 million to Yuk Tung Energy for oil purchases and Yuk Tung Energy held it on a “resulting Quistclose trust” for the shareholders.

> 9.    CAD has reason to suspect that the above actions by the shareholders constitute a suspected offence under Reg 9 of the UN-DPRK Regs. \[Redacted\]

>      _Other offences uncovered during the course of investigations_

> 10.    \[Redacted\] As such, CAD’s investigations extended to include possible contravention of Section 204A of the Penal Code.

>      _Seized properties_

>     ….

> 12.    On 10 May 2019, CAD sent a written order to ING Bank to seize the Seized Sum and direct the bank not to deal with the Seized Sum in any manner, without prior written instructions of the CAD. On 16 May 2019, ING Bank acknowledged CAD’s letter and the Seized Sum was seized pursuant to Section 35(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68. The Seized Sum is the subject matter in which an offence under Reg 9 of the UN-DPRK Regs is suspected to have been committed. The Seized Sum is the subject matter of this report.

>      _Reasons for continued seizure of the Seized Sum_

> 13.    CAD remains of the view that the Seized Sum is a property in respect of which an offence under Reg 9 of the UN-DPRK Regs is suspected to have been committed. CAD’s investigations into an offence under Reg 9 of the UN-DPRK Regs is currently ongoing. \[Redacted\]

> 14.    With regards to the Yuk Tung Energy’s three shareholders’ assertion that the Seized Sum was purportedly a loan made by them to Yuk Tung Energy, CAD’s preliminary investigations have found that:

>> a.    Yuk Tung Energy contracted with Petchem for gasoil and paid USD 15.8 million ’s bank account to Petchem’s ING Bank account for the gasoil. \[Redacted\]

>> b.    The three shareholders of Yuk Tung Energy were not parties to the contract for the sale of gasoil between Petchem and Yuk Tung Energy;

>> c.    \[Redacted\]

>> d.    Yuk Tung Energy paid USD 15.8 million from its USD bank account to Petchem’s ING bank account in tranches between 10 January 2018 to 23 January 2018. \[Redacted\]

>> …

>     …

> 16.    Given that Yuk Tung Energy is and remains a designated entity pursuant to the UNSC resolution 1718(2006), the Seized Sum falls under the ambit of Regulation 9 of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (Sanctions and Freezing of Assets of Persons – Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations 2016.

> 17.    CAD interviewed one of the shareholders of Yuk Tung Energy, Manfred in relation to the legal proceeding against Petchem. \[Redacted\]

> 18.    CAD’s investigations into offences under Reg 9 of the UN-DPRK Regs have been interrupted because of the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 situation and the Singapore Government’s implementation of the Circuit Breaker measures between 7 April 2020 to 1 June 2020. \[Redacted\]

> 19.    Allowing CAD to retain custody and control of the Seized Sum would also serve the purpose of preventing the dissipation of the Seized Sum pending a final order for the disposal of the Seized Property. CAD’s findings, once investigations into offences under Reg 9 of the UN-DPRK Regs are completed, would be surfaced to AGC for legal assessment in due course.

>     …

> 25.    As the Seized Sum of USD 15.8 million and its accrued interest continues to be relevant to CAD’s investigations and there is reasonable basis for continued seizure of the Seized Sum, I apply for a Court Order to:

>> a)    to retain and deal with the Seized Sum as CAD deems fit for the purpose of investigations; and

>> b)    to adjourn the matter until investigations are complete, and the suspects in the case are charged in court, or within 12 months, whichever is earlier.

### Events subsequent to the filing of the s 370 CPC Report

19     Upon receipt of the redacted s 370 CPC Report, the Respondents indicated their objection to the continued retention of the Funds by CAD. Directions were given to parties to file and exchange affidavits and written submissions, with the _inter partes_ hearing fixed on 15 October 2020.

20     On 11 September 2020, Quahe Woo & Palmer LLC (“QWP LLC”), counsel for the Respondents, informed the Court that the 2nd Respondent, Guai Lian Phuay, had passed away in early September 2020.

21     At the _inter partes_ hearing on 15 October 2020, the Prosecution and QWP LLC disagreed on whether the hearing should continue as QWP LLC has not yet been authorized to act for the Estate of the 2nd Respondent (“the 2R’s Estate”). I directed the hearing on 15 October 2020 to continue with QWP LLC representing the 1st and 3rd Respondents, and that a second tranche for this matter be fixed on a date subsequent to the formal appointment of counsel for the 2R’s Estate.

22     On 13 January 2021, Mr Tham Lijing from Tham Lijing LLC informed the Court that he has been appointed to act for the 2R’s Estate in this matter. Parties duly appeared before me for the second tranche of the _inter partes_ hearing on 8 February 2021. Upon considering parties’ submissions, I issued an oral judgment on 3 March 2021 directing that CAD’s seizure of the Funds be lifted, and the Funds be transferred back to Petchem’s operative bank account.

## Summary of the parties’ submissions

23     The Prosecution’s main submissions were as follows:

> (a)     The Respondents’ commencement of Suit 617 constitutes a suspected offence under Reg 9. As the Funds constitute property in respect of which an offence is suspected to have been committed, it is relevant for the purposes of ongoing investigations against the Respondents. The MC should therefore allow the continued retention of the Funds by CAD.

> (b)     The MC at this stage should not be assessing whether the suspected offence stated in the s 370 CPC Report is made out or not. There is nothing in s 370(3) of the CPC or the jurisprudence which suggests that the MC must undertake this exercise. The only matter the MC should consider and decide is whether the property is relevant for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding.

> (c)     Even if the Funds should be released, they should not be released to the Respondents because Petchem is the party entitled to possession. Petchem was the ostensible legal owner prior to seizure, and the Respondents have not shown a _prima facie_ entitlement to possession of the Funds.

24     The 1st and 3rd Respondents’ main submissions were as follows:

> (a)     The s 370 CPC Report does not disclose any reasonable basis to suspect that the Respondents had committed an offence under Reg 9. The commencement of Suit 617 does not amount to “dealing in” any property as prohibited under Reg 9. The Prosecution’s application for an extension of seizure of the Funds is not sound in law.

> (b)     The Respondents are the rightful owners entitled to possession of the Funds as they have a proprietary interest in the Funds by way of a resulting _Quistclose_ trust.

25     In addition, the 2R’s Estate made the following submissions:

> (a)     In a s 370 CPC application for the extension of seizure of property, the MC should ascertain whether the assertion of the suspected offence by the LEA as the basis for continued seizure is reasonably defensible as a matter of law. In the present case, the MC should consider whether there is a reasonable or _prima facie_ basis for the interpretation of the suspected offence advanced by the Prosecution.

> (b)     The Prosecution’s interpretation of Reg 9 is flawed as a matter of plain language and is contrary to established principles of statutory interpretation. There is no reasonable basis for the Prosecution’s assertion that a suspected offence under Reg 9 has been committed.

> (c)     The Respondents are _prima facie_ entitled to possession of the Funds, considering that the High Court had earlier granted an interim proprietary injunction in the Respondents’ favour, and this meant the High Court had accepted that there was a seriously arguable case of the existence of a _Quistclose_ trust in the Respondents’ favour.

## Issues

26     The following issues arose for my consideration:

> (a)     In a s 370 CPC application for the extension of seizure of property, does the Prosecution have to satisfy the MC that its interpretation of the suspected offence stated in the s 370 CPC report is defensible in law?

> (b)     Is the Prosecution in the present case able to satisfy the MC that that there is a reasonable basis for its interpretation of Reg 9?

> (c)     If the MC is not satisfied that the continued seizure of the Funds is relevant for the purposes of any investigation by CAD, who is the party “entitled to possession” of the Funds whom the Court should deliver the Funds to?

## The Prosecution has to satisfy the MC that its interpretation of the suspected offence stated in the s 370 report is defensible in law

27     The central issue before the Court which was heavily contested by parties is whether the Prosecution should be required to satisfy the MC, in a s 370 CPC proceeding, that its interpretation of the suspected offence stated in the s 370 CPC report is defensible in law.

### The reason for judicial oversight and the identification of a “suspected offence” in a s 370 CPC report

28     In order to answer this issue, I found it useful to first consider the role of the MC in a s 370 CPC proceeding. The Court of Appeal has held that s 370 CPC is “meant as a statutory check to hold the police accountable for seized property; if property is seized, its continued seizure must be for a good reason” (_Mustafa Ahunbay_ at \[7\]). A one-year “grace period” is given to a LEA to carry out investigations undisturbed. But once this period has expired, the LEA is required to “explain why the continued detention of the property is still needed. This is the balance which Parliament thought is fair, bearing in mind the interest of the individual and the needs of society to prevent crime” (_Mustafa Ahunbay_ at \[47\]). The “interest of the individual” referred to here has also been described as the _“_private interests of an applicant who has not yet been convicted” (_Rajendar Prasad Rai and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 333</span> (“_Rajendar Prasad_”) at \[50(b)\]).

29     The MC in a s 370 CPC proceeding is therefore tasked to balance a LEA’s need to retain seized properties for a longer period for investigations _etc_ against an innocent person’s right not to be deprived of her property except in accordance with law. In my view, appreciating the nature of the “private interests” of a claimant in this context requires a comprehensive understanding of how the presumption of innocence functions in our criminal justice system. The presumption of innocence is not just an evidential rule to ensure due process during criminal proceedings, critically important that may be. The acceptance of the presumption of innocence in our jurisprudence compels the broader recognition that individuals who have “not been convicted in criminal proceedings must not be treated … by persons acting for the state as guilty of an offence” (Stefan Trechsel, _Human Rights in Criminal Proceedings_ (OUP, 2005) at p 164).

30     When one considers that the most common forms of punishment for those convicted of offences are the deprivation of liberty (_ie_, an imprisonment sentence) and property (_ie_, a fine), it stands to reason why any deprivation of a person’s liberty (_eg_, in the denial of bail) or property (_eg_, the seizure of properties for investigations) _prior to conviction_ is clearly circumscribed in the CPC with judicial oversight in place as a check.

31     In the context of the deprivation of liberty prior to conviction, the High Court in _Abul Khabir Uddin Tohron Nisa v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGHC 57</span> at \[5\] has pointed out the following:

>     A grant of bail serves two important purposes. First, it helps to preserve the “golden thread” in criminal law, namely, that a person is innocent until proven guilty. Innocent people do not normally spend their time in jail. Secondly, there is a need to ensure that accused persons do not abscond before their trial, and bail serves as the instrument by which accused persons are discouraged from absconding.

32     The “golden thread” that is the presumption of innocence is not just a theoretical concept. It operates to guide the courts on a daily basis in determining the terms in which bail should be offered, to each and every accused person who is eligible to be offered bail. As the High Court explained in _Ewe Pang Kooi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 24</span> at \[9\]:

>     It is important to understand the fundamental basis for bail. Presumption of innocence is a foundational justice. When a person is charged, bail is the comfort and safeguard not only to those presumed innocent but to the entire system. We cannot acknowledge the presumption of innocence and then impose bail on such onerous terms that the accused cannot satisfy.

33     In the context of the deprivation of property prior to conviction, s 370 CPC functions as a statutory safeguard which recognises that a person who claims to be entitled to the possession of property seized by a LEA “has a direct interest in having the property released to him” (_Mustafa Ahunbay_ at \[47\]). The LEA is given, upon the seizure of the property, a one-year grace period before it needs to report the seizure to the MC, but “that grace period cannot be regarded by any measure as being too brief”, as the interest of the owner of the property “will clearly be prejudiced if the \[MC\] were to order the continued detention of the property” beyond the one-year grace period (_Mustafa Ahunbay_ at \[47\]).

34     The fundamental principle emanating from these cases is clear: innocent persons should ordinarily not be treated as if they are already guilty of offences, through either the deprivation of their liberty or properties, unless such acts of deprivation are justified in law.

35     The need for such justification in law explains why LEAs are _required_ to identify a “suspected offence” and to particularise the suspected “offending conduct” in a s 370 CPC report when seeking to retain seized properties for a period longer than one year. Failure to do so has resulted in an extension of seizure application being rejected by the Court (see _Rajendar Prasad_ at \[68\]; and _Lee Chen Seong Jeremy and others v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 867</span> (“_Jeremy Lee_”) at \[125\]). In _Jeremy Lee_, the High Court ordered the release of the seized property to the petitioners, given the lack of information in the s 370 CPC report pertaining to the offending conduct allegedly being investigated. In the words of the High Court in _Jeremy Lee_ at \[125\]:

>     … no information had been given at all to support even \[the\] contention as to how the seized property was evidence of any offence. The offending conduct had not been particularised to any degree, so far as the s 370 Report was concerned, because all that was said was that there were alleged offences under the Penal Code, or Companies Act, or Business Names Registration Act. And because it was impossible to tell what the offending conduct was, it in turn became impossible to determine if the documents and devices seized were indeed evidence of an offence falling within the provisions identified.

36     These requirements which the courts have imposed seek to ensure that the continued seizure of a property by a LEA is indeed “for a good reason” (_Mustafa Ahunbay_ at \[7\]). If the suspected offence or the offending conduct is not identified or properly particularised, the MC would have no basis to determine if there was any valid reason for the seized property to be retained further. If continued seizure of the properties is required “for the purposes of investigations” under s 370(3)(_b_) of the CPC, it must mean that there are indeed ongoing investigations of a _suspected offence_.

37     In my view, compelling a LEA to state the suspected offence and particularise the offending conduct in a s 370 CPC report essentially commits the LEA to _demonstrate reasoned judgment within the confines of law_. It ensures that when LEAs seek to further retain the properties of otherwise innocent persons, they have indeed _applied their minds_ to satisfy themselves – and if challenged, the Court – that the relevant factual matrix known to them does indeed reveal a suspected offence. This reasoned judgment which the LEA is required to demonstrate can be objectively attested to in the s 370 CPC report, where the LEA is required to set out, to the satisfaction of the MC, the suspected offence, the suspected offending conduct, and the “justification for the extension \[of seizure\] and of such facts \[which\] form the basis of its request” (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[48\]).

38     The judicial oversight which the MC is expected to carry out would be rendered illusory if the LEA has _carte blanche_ to cite whatever “suspected offence” it deems fit to cite, _with the MC not being able to assess the truth of this assertion in any way or form_. This, however, was essentially the Prosecution’s position before me, when it submitted that it would be premature or unprincipled to require the Prosecution to satisfy the MC in a s 370 CPC proceeding that its interpretation of the stated suspected offence advanced in the s 370 CPC report is defensible in law.

39     Yet how can a MC be convinced that the LEA has demonstrated reasoned judgment, if the fundamental premise underlying the application for continued seizure of the property is not even amenable to reason? More importantly, how can a person whose property has been seized be satisfied that the continued seizure of her property is sought for _a good reason_, if the LEA is not required to justify how the suspected offence asserted bears any relevance or semblance at all with the conduct in question or the known facts?

### The Applicable Test: Satisfying the MC that there is a reasonable basis for the interpretation of the suspected offence

40     In my judgment, having considered the role of the MC in a s 370 CPC proceeding and the underlying rationale behind the requirements of what needs to be stated in a s 370 CPC report, it is clear to me that the Prosecution’s interpretation of the suspected offence advanced in the s 370 CPC report has to be defensible in law. As for the applicable legal test, I found the submissions of the 2R’s Estate highly persuasive. In a s 370 CPC application where the claimants are challenging the Prosecution’s interpretation of the scope of the stated suspected offence, the Prosecution bears the burden of satisfying the MC that there is a _reasonable basis_ for the interpretation of the suspected offence it has advanced (“the Applicable Test”).

#### The Applicable Test is consistent with the role of the MC as set out in Rajendar Prasad

41     While the Prosecution correctly pointed out that the Applicable Test has not been formulated or applied by either the Court of Appeal or the High Court in the leading cases setting out the considerations the MC should bear in mind when deciding whether to extend seizure in a s 370 CPC hearing, the simple answer to this objection is that this was never an issue before any of these courts. In those cases, there was no indication that the party challenging the continued seizure of seized properties had disputed the _interpretation_ of the “suspected offence” asserted by the LEAs, which is the central issue in the present case.

42     The Applicable Test is necessary if one were to take seriously the concern of the High Court that the Magistrate in a s 370 CPC proceeding should not be “reduced to acting in a purely formal role to endorse whatever she was presented with, without any basis for satisfying herself that these assertions \[by the LEA\] were validly made” (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[49\]). While this statement was expressed by the High Court in the context of determining whether there was sufficient information in the s 370 CPC report linking the _property seized_ with the _stated suspected offence_, I see no reason in principle why the same scrutiny should not apply when the Magistrate is confronted with the issue of whether the assertion by the LEA as to the scope of the suspected offence was “_validly made_”. If the power to seize properties (and correspondingly, to retain them further) cannot apply to properties “in respect of which no identifiable offence has been committed” (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[36\]), any meaningful check on such powers cannot ignore the objection that no identifiable offence has been committed because the scope of the stated offence does not even cover the stated suspected conduct at all.

#### The Applicable Test strikes a balance between allowing LEAs to carry out their duties and the interests of persons who are innocent before the law

43     The Applicable Test cannot be and is not an onerous test. This is because investigations are usually not complete at the point where the s 370 CPC report is filed. Requiring the Prosecution to prove, at this stage, that all the elements of the suspected offence will be satisfactorily made out at trial would be inappropriate, given that the very purpose of an application to retain relevant properties is often to allow further investigations to be conducted, in order for the LEA to be convinced whether the stated suspected offence was indeed committed or not.

44     The Applicable Test does not require the Prosecution to satisfy such a high threshold. All it requires of the Prosecution is for it to show, when challenged, that there is a _prima facie_ basis supporting its interpretation of the stated suspected offence. This can _easily_ be satisfied by the Prosecution in the following ways:

> (a)     The Prosecution can show that its interpretation of the suspected offence is _textually sound_. This involves a straightforward comparison of the words in the relevant statute in which the suspected offence is situated, and the alleged wrongdoing constituting the offending conduct, to show that a semantic symmetry exists between the relevant keywords.

> (b)     The Prosecution can show that its interpretation of the suspected offence is _legally sustainable_. On this ground, the Prosecution can seek to convince the Court that if additional facts related to the suspected wrongdoing are subsequently uncovered during further investigations, the suspected offence may be made out. Alternatively, the Prosecution can point to any relevant authority which supports its interpretation of the suspected offence, to show that its interpretation is in fact _arguable_ in law.

45     The Applicable Test strikes a right balance between giving LEAs as much latitude as possible to retain seized property to further investigate the stated suspected offence, and the presumption of innocence which applies in favour of the party whose property has been seized for more than a year. It ensures that _one year after seizure_, the LEA is indeed investigating a suspected offence in good faith, and is not simply retaining the property of an innocent person without valid justification.

46     The Applicable Test is consistent with the law governing how an arrest of an individual without warrant would have to be justified, if challenged in court. In _Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 582</span> at \[104\], the High Court held that when such arrests are challenged in a judicial review application, one of the questions the Court should ask is whether there was _reasonable cause_ for the police officer’s suspicion that an offence had been committed.

47     In my view, this objective test which is applied in the judicial scrutiny of the arrests of persons should equally apply to the judicial scrutiny of the seizure of a person’s property. In both instances, the power to deprive a person of his right to liberty or property is sourced to and justified by the assertion that a suspected offence has been committed. In both instances, the facts within the knowledge of the LEA at the material time where the decision was made to arrest or seize may not be sufficient to conclusively prove that the suspected offence has in fact been committed. Yet in both instances, the LEA’s claim that a suspected offence has been committed is not – and _should not be_ – immune from review.

48     The justification for applying the Applicable Test in a s 370 CPC proceeding is further buttressed when one considers the following: The arrest of a person is a decision which a police officer may have to make in a matter of seconds or on the spur of the moment, based on the police officer’s belief that an offence has been committed. If such a belief, when challenged, must be shown to have a “reasonable cause” in light of the factual substratum to withstand judicial scrutiny, it is difficult to understand why the assertion of a suspected offence in a s 370 CPC report, _one entire year after the property has been seized_, should not be held to a similar – if not more exacting – standard.

#### The Applicable Test ensures that LEAs cannot act arbitrarily or unreasonably when seizing and retaining properties

49     If the Applicable Test is rejected as per the Prosecution’s submission, it would leave parties whose properties have been seized with _no recourse_ at all against what may be a blatantly unlawful or irrational act of seizure by LEAs.

50     During the hearing, I had asked the Prosecution to consider whether the MC should allow the continued seizure of the Funds, if the stated suspected offence in the s 370 CPC Report was that of _theft_ under s 378 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) instead (_ie_, that by commencing Suit 617, the Respondents are suspected to have committed the offence of theft of the Funds). The Prosecution appeared to have agreed that the MC should not allow the further retention of the Funds should such a s 370 CPC report be filed. The explanation provided was that if theft was stated in the report instead of Reg 9, there would be “_no relevance_” between the Funds and any ongoing investigations as to theft. But when pressed to explain why _relevance_ could not be shown in the case of theft as opposed to Reg 9, the Prosecution was unable to provide a sound explanation distinguishing the hypothetical posed from the present facts.

51     In my judgment, the Prosecution was unable to provide a sound explanation because it was applying the wrong analytical tool in an attempt to reach the just outcome. A property which is the _subject matter_ of a suspected property offence will _necessarily_ be “relevant” to it – a perfect alignment will ordinarily exist between the property in question and a property offence such as theft, or Reg 9. The only answer which can satisfactorily explain why the hypothetical posed is problematic is that the _scope_ of the suspected offence (_ie_, theft) simply does not cover the _suspected conduct alleged_ (_ie_, the act of commencing Suit 617). More importantly, this conclusion can only be reached if one is prepared to first ask whether there exists a reasonable basis supporting the interpretation advanced of the stated suspected offence.

52     If the MC has to accept, by dint of the Prosecution’s assertion, that the LEA is investigating an “identifiable crime”, it would be “meaningless in such circumstances to speak of judicial oversight of the seizure process” (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[49\]). There would practically speaking be no added value in requiring a LEA to state “an identifiable crime that … is suspected to have been committed” (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[47\]) in a s 370 CPC report. This is because LEAs will be in a position to state _any_ penal provision in a s 370 CPC report, however far-fetched or implausible the stated offence may be when juxtaposed with the known facts (_ie_, the suspected conduct), and then state that because the property in question is the subject matter of the stated offence, the retention of the property should be allowed. Such a position if validated makes a “mockery of the exercise of judicial oversight by the Magistrate” (_Jeremy Lee_ at \[49\]).

53     A MC which takes seriously its duty in a s 370 CPC proceeding to apply “consideration and judgment” in order to ensure that it does not “simply rubber-stamp the process” (_Mustafa Ahunbay_ at \[43\]) cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that there exists no reasonable basis supporting the Prosecution’s interpretation or assertion that a suspected offence has been committed.

54     In the course of these proceedings, the Prosecution also submitted that if the Respondents were dissatisfied with CAD’s basis for seizure, its only recourse was to initiate judicial review in the High Court, instead of raising this issue in a s 370 CPC hearing. The Prosecution relied on the comments made by the High Court in _Rajendar Prasad_ on judicial review to support its view. The following passages in _Rajendar Prasad_ are reproduced as follows:

> \[41\]  Section 35 of the CPC, in the first instance, confers the power of seizure on the Police. But, in keeping with the oft-cited observation in _Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs_ <span class="citation">\[1988\] 2 SLR(R) 525</span> at \[86\] and reiterated more recently in _Tan Seet Eng v AG_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 779</span> at \[2\], “all power has legal limits”. Hence the power of seizure under s 35 of the CPC is not immune from review; but in keeping with the architecture of the provision itself and of the CPC as a whole, it would fall on the applicant, in a given case, to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the power has been invoked or exercised unlawfully, even if this is likely to place an imposing burden on such an applicant.

> \[42\]  Leaving that to one side, in the normal case, after a seizure has been made under s 35, the process then shifts to s 370…

> \[43\]  At this stage, assuming the Police wish to extend the seizure beyond the one-year period, judicial oversight is imposed…

>     …

> \[50\]  In my judgment, the threshold for _continued seizure_ under s 370 of the CPC should be and is more stringent than the threshold for initial seizure under s 35 of the CPC. This follows from the fact that:

>> (a)    by the time the matter is reviewed under s 370, a period of up to one year would have passed;

>> (b)    judicial oversight is introduced at this stage and this is only meaningful, as I have noted above, if the court is presented with enough information to assess and calibrate the balance between the private interests of an applicant who has not yet been convicted and the public interest in the contemplated prosecution; and

>> (c)    otherwise, the only remedy in respect of a seizure under s 35 would be judicial review, which as I have noted at \[41\] above presents a demanding threshold to meet given the broad powers conferred upon the Police by s 35.

55     For the reasons below, I disagreed with the Prosecution’s position that judicial review is the only recourse available for the Respondents to challenge CAD’s basis for seizure. In my opinion, the Prosecution’s reliance on the aforementioned passages in _Rajendar Prasad_ to reach this conclusion is also flawed.

56     First, the Prosecution’s position on this issue is contradicted by the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Ung Yoke Hooi v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 307</span> (“_Ung Yoke Hooi_”). In _Ung Yoke Hooi_, the Court of Appeal denied the appellant leave to file a judicial review seeking a mandatory order directing that the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) release the accounts seized. The Court of Appeal explained that this was because (at \[26\]):

>     …once the seizures were reported to an MC, no matter that the report was unduly late, this meant that the MC had taken cognisance of the report and, thenceforth, the legal control and custody of the property had passed to the MC under s 392 \[of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)\]. For this reason … the High Court had no power since 8 February 2007 (when \[CPIB\] reported the seizures to the MC) to grant a mandatory order to direct CPIB to unfreeze the bank accounts as they were then in the control and custody of the MC. The only recourse now open to the Appellant is to apply to the MC to exercise its powers under s 393(1) to determine whether the Appellant is entitled to have the seized accounts released.

57     While _Ung Yoke Hooi_ dealt with an older version of s 370 CPC, there is nothing in the presently enacted s 370 CPC or the relevant parliamentary debates which suggest that this _particular_ holding in _Ung Yoke Hooi_ at \[26\] is no longer good law. As such, it would have been _procedurally flawed_ for the Respondents to file an application for judicial review in the High Court to challenge CAD’s seizure of the Funds, once the s 370 CPC Report has been filed. The Respondents’ “only recourse”, according to _Ung Yoke Hooi_, was to convince the MC to have the Funds released.

58     Second, it is erroneous to read the High Court in _Rajendar Prasad_ as suggesting that there are parallel, alternative tracks which avail a claimant who wishes to challenge the continued seizure of his property _after the s 370 CPC report has been filed_. The thrust of the High Court’s reasoning leading up to \[51\] of _Rajendar Prasad_ (see above at \[54\]) was to explain why a “more stringent” threshold should be imposed on the LEA “by the time the matter is reviewed under s 370”, as compared to a judicial review challenge. When the High Court opined that “_otherwise, the only remedy in respect of a seizure under s 35 would be judicial review_” (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[51(c)\]), it was _not_ suggesting that claimants could still consider the option of judicial review to seek recourse even after a s 370 CPC report has been filed. In my view, the High Court was engaging in counterfactual reasoning at this point to explain that _if not for_ the existence of s 370 CPC or the “more stringent” threshold imposed on the LEA in a s 370 CPC hearing, the only remedy which would have availed a claimant would be judicial review, which imposes “a demanding threshold \[for a claimant\] to meet” (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[51(c)\]). This explains why “_in the normal case_, after a seizure has been made under s 35, _the process … shifts to s 370_” (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[42\], emphasis added); and if the LEA wishes to extend seizure beyond the one-year mark at that point, “judicial oversight is imposed” (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[43\]) in the form of the MC ensuring that the LEA satisfies certain requirements which it would not have had to in a judicial review challenge.

59     When analysed carefully and _in context_, the comments by the High Court in _Rajendar Prasad_ simply do not support the Prosecution’s position that a claimant is free to apply for judicial review to challenge the LEA’s basis for seizure even after the s 370 CPC report has been filed, or that a claimant in a s 370 CPC hearing should be precluded from raising certain arguments before the MC which it could have raised in a judicial review challenge. In my analysis, the passages in _Rajendar Prasad_ are entirely consistent with the Court of Appeal’s holding that once a s 370 CPC report has been filed, the appropriate recourse would be for a claimant to “apply to the \[MC\] to exercise its powers … to determine whether \[he is\] entitled to have the seized \[properties\] released” (_Ung Yoke Hooi_ at \[26\]), where “the threshold for _continued seizure_ under s 370 of the CPC should be and is more stringent than the threshold for initial seizure under s 35 of the CPC” in favour of the claimant (_Rajendar Prasad_ at \[50\]).

60     Third, it would practically speaking be quite unwieldy if the Prosecution’s understanding is correct – _ie_, that in the midst of a contested s 370 CPC proceeding, a claimant who wishes to raise the issue of whether the LEA’s basis for seizure is justifiable in law should be made to file a separate application for judicial review in the High Court. The Prosecution could not satisfactorily explain why requiring the claimant to do this was necessary or desirable, when it was precisely the MC’s role to “to hold the \[LEA\] accountable for seized property” (_Mustafa Ahunbay_ at \[7\]). It must be highlighted that the s 370 CPC Report filed does not even distinguish between the “basis for initial seizure” and the “basis for continued seizure”. In challenging the _stated basis_ for the continued seizure of the Funds in the s 370 CPC Report, the Respondents were doing precisely what the s 370 CPC process entitles them to do, even if such a challenge should show up CAD’s lack of a legal basis to seize the Funds in the very first place.

61     In summary, I was of the view that the holding in \[26\] of _Ung Yoke Hooi_ remains good law, is binding on this Court, and is not contradicted by the comments of the High Court in _Rajendar Prasad_. This would mean that had I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission to reject the Applicable Test, the Respondents would be left with _no recourse_ to challenge what in their view was a seizure that was legally flawed from the start. This cannot be right. Prior to the s 370 CPC Report being filed, the Respondents did not know what the “suspected offence” even was which led to the seizure, as CAD at that stage was not obliged to disclose this to the Respondents; and in fact, did not do so. When the s 370 CPC Report was filed and the basis of seizure was finally made clear to the Respondents for the first time, it would be patently unjust that they should now have no recourse to challenge the basis of seizure because they had not chosen to do so prior to knowing what it was.

## There is no reasonable basis for the interpretation of the suspected Reg 9 offence advanced by the Prosecution

62     In the present case, the Respondents have challenged the Prosecution’s interpretation of the stated suspected offence advanced in the s 370 CPC Report. Applying the Applicable Test, the Prosecution would have to satisfy me that there is a reasonable basis for its interpretation of Reg 9, _viz_, that the commencement of Suit 617 by the Respondents can fall within the definition of “_deal\[ing\], directly or indirectly, in \[the Funds\]_” which is prohibited by Reg 9. For the reasons stated below, the Prosecution failed to establish that a reasonable basis exists for this interpretation of Reg 9.

### The Prosecution’s interpretation of Reg 9 is textually unsound

63     First, the Prosecution’s interpretation of Reg 9 is textually unsound. To use the plain language test, it is unheard of that when a party commences legal proceedings in court to claim ownership or possession over a property, the said party is described to be “_dealing in_” or having “_dealt with_” the property in question. The Prosecution offered not a single example in which the phrases “deal in” and “dealt with” have been used in this manner.

64     The Prosecution made reference to Art 6(1) of the North Korea (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 in the United Kingdom, which is in _pari materia_ with Reg 9. Art 6(4) defines “_deal with_” in Art 6(1) to mean “_deal with in any other way that would result in any change in … ownership, possession… \[of the Funds\]_”. While this does suggest that the phrase “deal in” or “deal with” in the context of this statutory provision is meant to be interpreted broadly, nothing has been shown by the Prosecution to suggest that Reg 9 should be interpreted _so broadly_ as to cover the mere act of the commencement of legal proceedings.

65     Furthermore, as the Respondents accurately pointed out, the mere commencement of legal proceedings has no effect on the substantive rights of parties in relation to the property in question_, ie_, it does not “_result in any change_” in the ownership or possession of the property.[^1] These substantive rights are engaged only upon an order or judgment of the Court. Going by the Prosecution’s interpretation, the party which actually “_deals in_” the property would in fact be the Court.

### The Prosecution’s interpretation of Reg 9 is legally unsustainable

66     Second, the Prosecution’s interpretation of Reg 9 is legally unsustainable.

67     The Prosecution was asked at the hearing whether further investigations could uncover _any fact_ which would then suggest that a Reg 9 offence has been committed by the mere act of commencing legal proceedings. The Prosecution either could not or did not want to refer to any such facts, save as to suggest that investigations could reveal a “_separate set of offending conduct … which falls …. more closely within the rubric of dealing_”.[^2] With respect, this strikes me as nothing more than unreasoned speculation. The commitment of _reasoned judgment_ demanded of CAD (see above at \[37\]) requires the Prosecution to make sense of what is _stated_ in the s 370 CPC report, not an unidentified and unknown “_separate set of offending conduct_”.

68     More critically, not a single authority has been tendered by the Prosecution to show that its interpretation of Reg 9 is supported by _any_ authority _anywhere in the world_. It bears mentioning that as early as 8 October 2020, even before the two hearings on 15 October 2020 and 8 February 2021, I had already requested parties to tender any local or foreign authority which would shed light on this specific issue (_ie_, whether the commencement of a civil suit can amount to “dealing in” the property under Reg 9). Yet, as of the second hearing on 8 February 2021 (_ie_, two hearings and four months later), not a single authority except the UK legislation referred to above at \[64\] has been tendered by the Prosecution. The reasonable inference which must be drawn is that the Prosecution was simply unable to find any support for the interpretation it was advancing before me.

69     The practical import of the Prosecution’s interpretation, if accepted even at this preliminary stage, is startling. It would mean that whenever a LEA takes the view that a certain property belongs to a “_designated person_” under the UN-DPRK Regs, a third party claimant who disagrees and attempts to have the matter adjudicated in court will run the risk of being “suspected” of having committed the offence of Reg 9, and be liable to have the very property he is seeking to recover seized by the LEA “for the purposes of investigations”. Such an interpretation of Reg 9 runs up against the principle that the right of a person to “bring, defend, conduct and compromise legal proceedings without unwarranted obstruction is a basic right of citizenship” (Diggory Bailey and Luke Nobury, _Bennion on Statutory Interpretation_ (LexisNexis, 7th Ed, 2017) at p 738). The Prosecution’s interpretation is rightly characterized by the Respondents as “\[cutting\] against the right of access to justice and is contrary to established principles of statutory interpretation”.[^3] Such an “expansive interpretation” of Reg 9, an offence punishable by imprisonment of up to 10 years, must require the support of “relevant legislative material” (_Bachoo Mohan Singh v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 137</span> at \[147\]). Yet, not a single relevant legislative material, judicial decision, policy paper, textbook extract or academic article was tendered to support the Prosecution’s interpretation. Without any shred of support for the proposition that a regulation in a piece of subsidiary legislation under the United Nations Act (Cap 339, 2002 Rev Ed) was intended to curtail a person’s access to justice in the manner the Prosecution’s interpretation entails, I simply could not agree that there is a reasonable basis for the interpretation advanced by the Prosecution. The Prosecution’s interpretation of Reg 9 is legally unsustainable.

70     Given that the Prosecution was not able to show me that there is a reasonable basis for its interpretation of Reg 9, I found CAD’s claim that the Funds seized are still relevant “for the purposes of investigations” into a Reg 9 offence to be a groundless one. As the s 370 CPC Report disclosed _no basis_ at all to suspect that a Reg 9 offence had been committed, s 370(3)(_b_) CPC was, contrary to the Prosecution’s submissions, not applicable. This meant that I would have to order the delivery of the Funds to the “person entitled to possession” under s 370(2)(_e_)(i) CPC, an issue which I shall now turn.

## The Funds should be returned to the ostensible legal owner who had possession prior to seizure

71     In determining who the appropriate person seized properties should be returned to, the Magistrate often has to exercise her judgment in a “rough and ready fashion”, and deliver the properties to the party to whom, “after a consideration of the evidence, appears to \[the Magistrate\] to be entitled to possession” (_Sim Cheng Ho v Lee Eng Soon_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 190</span> (“_Sim Cheng Ho_”) at \[9\]). The MC must however be satisfied that the party to whom the properties are to be returned to has _lawful_ entitlement to possession (_Oon Heng Lye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1064</span> at \[45\]).

72     In the present case, the Funds were seized from Petchem’s bank account. It was not disputed that Petchem was and remained the ostensible legal owner of the Funds. The Funds were lawfully transferred from YTE to Petchem in January 2018 pursuant to their contract to trade in gasoil before they were seized by CAD in May 2019. While the Respondents might have initiated a civil claim against Petchem to recover the Funds, this did not change the fact that Petchem was the lawful, legal owner of the Funds until the civil claim has been adjudicated and a decision made by the Court. On the face of it, Petchem thus appeared to me to be the party entitled to possession of the Funds.

73     The Respondents submitted that the Funds should not be returned to Petchem because Petchem had not made any claim in this s 370 CPC proceeding, and had on various occasions disclaimed interest in the Funds in Suit 617. However, s 370 CPC does not mandate that the person entitled to possession must be before the MC. It does _not_ follow that just because Petchem had not objected to CAD’s application to continue seizing the Funds for an extended period of time, it was therefore no longer entitled to possession of them. While Petchem did file an interpleader summons in Suit 617 clarifying that it did not want to assert interest in the Funds, and was willing to return them to the rightful party pursuant to the High Court’s direction, the test I had to apply in s 370(2)(e)(i) of the CPC is whether Petchem appeared to be _entitled to possession of the Funds_, not whether it _remained interested_ in the possession of the Funds.

74     Much ink has been spilt by the Respondents on why they are entitled to possession of the Funds, based essentially on the merits of their civil claim in Suit 617 (_ie_, that they have beneficial ownership of the Funds by virtue of a _Quistclose_ trust existing between YTE (the alleged trustee) and themselves (the alleged beneficial owners)). But this argument of theirs was quite ably contested by the Prosecution in the course of these proceedings. The Prosecution has pointed out to the Court, using the documentary evidence tendered by the Respondents, that serious questions could be asked of the merits of the Respondents’ claim to possession of the Funds by virtue of their alleged beneficial ownership as a result of the _Quistclose_ trust. The Respondents’ claim was confronted with the following factual and legal challenges:

> (a)     Whether the entirety of the Funds truly belonged to or could be sourced to the Respondents;

> (b)     Whether the transfer of monies from the Respondents to YTE were in the form of loans or investments;

> (c)     Whether the purported loans made by the Respondents were distinguishable or commingled with the paid-up capital of YTE;

> (d)     Whether there existed a clear intention of the Respondents to restrict YTE’s freedom to dispose or use the Funds, such that a resulting _Quistclose_ trust would arise;

> (e)     Whether the purpose of the _Quistclose_ trust, assuming one even existed, had indeed failed; and

> (f)     Whether the Respondents as beneficial owners have the power or right to compel a third party like Petchem to deliver possession of the Funds to them.

75     In my view, many of these challenges can only be satisfactorily resolved after a trial, where the oral evidence of the Respondents can be considered together with the contemporaneous documentary evidence (see, for example, the importance of considering the oral evidence when a claim relying on a _Quistclose_ trust is advanced in _Ho Yew Kong v ERC Holdings Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 83</span> at \[51\]-\[52\]). Without the benefit of hearing the oral evidence of the Respondents, and given the various factual and legal challenges outlined above, I was not able to find that the Respondents are the parties entitled to possession of the Funds, even on a _prima facie_ basis.

76     The Respondents highlighted that an interim proprietary injunction had been granted in their favour by the High Court in Suit 617, which meant that the High Court must have accepted that there is a “seriously arguable case” that they are the beneficial owners of the Funds. This, they argued, meant that they had a _prima facie_ entitlement to possession of the Funds. I was not convinced that it is correct to make such an inference. The aim and effect of the interim injunction was to _preserve the status quo of the Funds_ to ensure that Petchem would not dispose of them prior to the full resolution of the matter in Suit 617. The High Court did not hold that the Respondents were _entitled to the possession_ of the Funds, in any way or form. The conclusion sought (_ie_, that the Respondents are entitled to possession) can only be reached if the Respondents are able to show – at trial – that not only are they truly the beneficial owners, but that as a result of their beneficial ownership, they may now demand possession of the Funds from Petchem, a third party who is not the trustee.

77     During the hearing, I had asked the Respondents’ counsel whether they were aware of a similar case where the MC, in a s 370 CPC proceeding, had decided that seized properties should be returned to a beneficial owner by virtue of a _Quistclose_ trust. The Respondents acknowledged that they had not come across anything similar. This could be because, as the Respondents suggested, an argument premised on a _Quistclose_ trust is not litigated frequently in court. But, in my view, it could also indicate the “inadequacy of a disposal inquiry as a forum to adjudicate complex issues of civil law" (_Sim Cheng Ho_ at \[26\]), as the “determination of the rightful possessor \[in such proceedings\] was never intended to be anything than an expeditious and inexpensive process” (_Criminal Procedure in Singapore and Malaysia_ (Tan Yock Lin & S Chandra Mohan gen eds) (LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed, 2020) (“_Criminal Procedure in Singapore and Malaysia_”) at Ch VI, para 2204). When complex issues are raised, with “tremendous conflict of evidence which remained unresolved”, it would be appropriate for the MC to order “a return to status quo” (_Sim Cheng Ho_ at \[25\]) in favour of “the person from whom the property was seized” (_Criminal Procedure in Singapore and Malaysia_ at Ch VI, para 2205), so long as that person is indeed entitled to possession of the property. Any aggrieved party will not be constrained by the MC’s order in subsequent civil proceedings. This was exactly what ordering the Funds to be delivered back to Petchem achieved.

78     I did note the oddity of ordering the return of the Funds to a party who was not before the Court, and who had sought to relinquish possession lawfully previously. But ultimately, as the Respondents have not shown me that they were _entitled to possession_ of the Funds even on a _prima facie_ basis, it would be erroneous for me to direct that the Funds be returned to them, or be held in escrow by the Respondents’ counsel for a short period of time to allow any other interested parties to make a claim for the Funds, as suggested by the Respondents’ counsel. I found the latter proposal problematic as the Respondents would still, by default, become the parties entitled to possession of the Funds should no challenge be raised in time.

79     For the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that party entitled to possession of the Funds was Petchem, and that the Funds should be transferred back to Petchem’s bank account from which they were seized.

## The Court’s comments on CAD’s actions

80     The consequence of my order that the Funds are to be transferred back to Petchem meant that parties are now put in the position they were in before the Respondents had commenced Suit 617 on 18 June 2018. While the unjustified application for continued seizure by CAD did not make returning the Funds to the Respondents justifiable, I fully recognize that the Respondents have good reason to feel aggrieved at CAD’s actions.

81     To recap, a few months after the commencement of Suit 617, and in response to the interpleader summons filed by Petchem, CAD had filed CAD’s affidavit dated 25 March 2019 stating, amongst other things (see above at \[13\]), that given the Respondents’ claim to the Funds were already before the Court in Suit 617, the evidential and legal issues relating to the claim, including any defence of illegality to be raised by Petchem should be fully ventilated and decided by the Court in Suit 617.

82     On 24 April 2019, AGC had also formally applied to be an Intervening Party in Suit 617, in order to make submissions on whether payment of the Funds to the Respondents would contravene or undermine the public policy of the UN-DPRK Regs, should the High Court agree with the Respondents that a trust was created over the Funds for their benefit.

83     The procedural history of Suit 617 up to this point would suggest _– as CAD asserted in its own affidavit_ – that the various issues relating to the Respondents’ claim (including whether any UN-DPRK Regs offences would be contravened should the Funds be paid to the Respondents) should be “fully ventilated \[in\] and decided” by the High Court in Suit 617. The decision of the High Court on these issues would have brought finality for all parties involved.

84     Inexplicably, just 3 days before the trial in the High Court, CAD decided to seize the Funds, on the purported basis, revealed only on 9 May 2020, that the mere act of the Respondents commencing Suit 617 constitutes a suspected offence under Reg 9. This act of theirs resulted in the Respondents discontinuing Suit 617 on 13 May 2019, given the Respondents’ reasonable concern of wasting further time and expending unnecessary costs to pursue the matter when the subject matter of the civil proceedings had been abruptly seized by CAD.

85     The s 370 CPC Report filed by CAD on 9 May 2020 contains no explanation whatsoever why it was necessary for the Funds to be seized on the eve of the trial, when: (a) CAD had acknowledged in its affidavit that all relevant issues should be “fully ventilated \[in\] and decided” by the High Court in Suit 617; and (b) it was clear that Petchem would not be releasing the Funds without judicial sanction. In fact, there was already in place what could be viewed as a “double lock” preventing Petchem from releasing the Funds prior to the High Court’s determination. First, Petchem itself was under a proprietary injunction granted by the High Court not to release the Funds (see above at \[10\]). Second, CAD’s affidavit dated 25 March 2019 had stated unequivocally that payment of the Funds to the Respondents would contravene Reg 9 (see above at \[13\]). At the hearing before me on 8 Feb 2021, the Prosecution also confirmed that there was no risk of dissipation of the Funds if they were returned to Petchem.[^4]

86     As it turns out, CAD’s seizure was without legal basis and the only outcome this act achieved was to cause the adjudication of the issues in Suit 617 in the High Court to be prematurely terminated. In the meantime, the 2nd Respondent passed away in September 2020. While the death of the 2nd Respondent is of course no fault of CAD’s, this is a salutary reminder that unjustified acts of seizure by a LEA can have prejudicial consequences. Should there be a need for the Respondents to recommence its civil action in Suit 617, the High Court would no longer have the benefit of hearing the oral evidence of the 2nd Respondent, who might have been a material witness in aiding the Court decide whether a _Quistclose_ trust truly exists in the Respondents’ favour.

87     In light of what has transpired, I found it difficult not to agree with the Respondents that CAD’s actions in this instance constitutes an “oppressive use of the CAD’s seizure powers”.[^5] The unnecessary delay and wasted costs CAD’s actions had caused to the Respondents – if not also Petchem – is regrettable. CAD’s actions have wrongfully prejudiced the Respondents’ legitimate quest for justice in the High Court in relation to the Funds, regardless of whether the Respondents have a meritorious claim in Suit 617 or not.

88     As the learned authors in _Criminal Procedure in Singapore and Malaysia_ aptly put it, “if no crime has been perpetrated there should be no possibility of search and seizure. Searches which are disguised fishing expeditions are as intolerable as arrests which are disguised false imprisonments” (at Ch VI, para 5). In my view, the _seizure_ of properties which has no justification in reason or law should be viewed as equally intolerable in our criminal justice system. In order not to commit such intolerable acts in the exercise of their duties, LEAs holding on to seized properties should constantly ask themselves the central question which has been asked, and answered, in these proceedings: _Is there a reasonable basis to believe that there exists a suspected offence justifying the continued seizure of the seized properties_? An honest answer to this question would properly inform LEAs on what they should do in relation to seized properties.

89     In our criminal justice system, the powers of seizure which LEAs are entrusted to wield are understandably wide, so that they may confidently carry out their duties in the public interest, for the efficient administration of criminal justice. But such powers must always be exercised – _and justified_, when challenged – in a manner which does not undermine the “cornerstone of the criminal justice system” (_XP v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 686</span> at \[90\]): the presumption of innocence. All persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty. This means they have a _right_ not to be deprived of the possession or the legitimate, legal pursuit of their properties, unless such acts of deprivation are justified in law. Mirroring this right is the following _duty_ imposed on the LEA: In a s 370 CPC application where the continued seizure of seized properties is sought, the LEA must be prepared to satisfy the MC that there is a reasonable basis for the interpretation of the suspected offence it has advanced, demonstrating that it has in the exercise of its powers applied reasoned judgment within the confines of law.

## Conclusion

90     For all of the foregoing reasons, I rejected the Prosecution’s application for the continued retention of the Funds by CAD and ordered that the Funds be released to Petchem, the party who in my judgment was entitled to the possession of the Funds.
