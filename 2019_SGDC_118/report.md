Building and Construction Law

13 June 2019

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

## DCA 13/2019

1       The Plaintiffs, Seah Kim Cheok Construction Co. (Pte) Ltd (“SKC”), at all material times, were building contractors.

2       The Defendants, Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd (“ATP”), at all material times, were in the business of supplying and installation of timber flooring and decking.

3       SKC had been awarded a contract for the erection of 10 terrace houses at Cashew Road (the “project”).

4       SKC had appointed ATP as sub-contractors for the carrying out of certain carpentry and joinery works for the project. The scope of works included the supply and installation of the timber flooring and decking works for the project. The contract sum for this sub-contract was $317,172.44.

5       The dispute in this Suit revolved round that part of the sub-contract which required ATP to “(supply) and install removable teak coloured stained chengal decking comprising of 45x20mm chengal timber frame and 95x20mm (thick) chengal timber strip (including) all fixing accessories” for the roof terraces and courtyards of the various houses under construction.

6       ATP installed the decking. However, soon after (within a short span of a few months), defects started appearing in some of these works that had been carried out by ATP. Some of the defects involved signs of rotting and deterioration, “obvious crack lines” and “obvious patch marks”.

7       SKC asked ATP to replace the defective timber. This was never done by ATP. It was discovered then that ATP had used “resak” timber instead of chengal. The architects for the project required SKC (by an Architect’s Direction dated 20 February 2014) to replace the resak timber with the contractually agreed chengal timber.

8       As ATP had not replaced the timber as required, SKC had to subsequently engage another sub-contractor to replace the affected timber. All the timber decking that had been installed by ATP had to be removed, and replaced by the new sub-contractor (Cheng Fong Enterprises (S) Pte Ltd {“Cheng Fong”}) for this part of the works.

9       SKC brought this Suit against ATP in respect of losses and expenses incurred as a result of the breach of contract which SKC alleged of ATP. After hearing all the evidence and carefully considering the Closing Submissions tendered by the respective solicitors for SKC and ATP, I found in favour of SKC. SKC had proven its case against ATP and I allowed the quantified claim of SKC in its entirety. Judgment against ATP was therefore entered, for the total sum of $137,264.41, interest thereon at 5.33% per annum from date of writ till date of judgment, and costs to be agreed or taxed. ATP appealed against this decision.

10     SKC was successful in proving that ATP had breached the contract on several fronts. These can be summarised as follows. ATP had failed to provide timber that had to comprise wholly of chengal timber, as contractually required. ATP had failed to provide timber corresponding to the contracted dimensions set out in paragraph 5 above. ATP had failed to provide timber that had been pressure impregnated with preservative. ATP had failed to remove the non-conforming timber and replace accordingly with timber that fully met the contractually agreed specifications.

11     ATP had sought to argue that certain terms (which SKC were relying on) had not formed part of the sub-contract between them and SKC. ATP argued that their quotation dated 4 October 2012 had been accepted by SKC’s “Letter of Acceptance” dated 5 November 2012. SKC had argued otherwise.

12     I accepted SKC’s argument on this point. It was clear that, in contractual terms, SKC’s Letter of Acceptance would be characterised as a “counter offer” as such. The Letter of Acceptance “introduced” fresh and clear terms of the contract to be entered into between SKC (as the main contractor for the project) and ATP (as SKC’s appointed sub-contractor). Notice of the relevant provisions of the Main Contract between SKC and the developers was incorporated, as were other documents including an 8-page annex titled “Carpentry and Joinery”.

13     This annex, inter alia, required ATP to provide a Grading Certificate for the timber supplied, required the timber to have a moisture content of a maximum of 18%, and required the timber to have been pressure impregnated with preservative.

14     The most compelling reason for holding that the Letter of Acceptance held terms that would bind ATP was the fact that the “acceptance” was to be signified by ATP. ATP’s authorised signatory appended his signature and the company’s stamp, confirming that the Letter of Acceptance “shall constitute a legal and binding Contract between” ATP as sub-contractor, and SKC as the main contractor.

15     Upon a careful consideration of the expert evidence produced by SKC and ATP, I found that ATP had clearly not fulfilled their obligations, in particular, with regard to the crucial requirement of the type (the species) of timber provided, as well as the dimensions of the timber provided.

16     The evidence led at trial as a whole also led to the conclusion that the majority of the timber supplied had not conformed to the contractually required dimensions and had not been pressure impregnated with preservative.

17     In my view, the most crucial aspect of breach on the part of ATP had been their failure to provide timber that had wholly consisted of chengal timber. And it is to this point that I found that SKC had acted reasonably after discovering this breach on the part of ATP.

18     As far as the contract between SKC and ATP was concerned (and indeed, primarily between the developers and SKC as the main contractors), the provision of chengal timber (as opposed to other forms of timber which may have similar characteristics to chengal timber) was specifically spelt out.

19     The fact that some of the species found amongst the discarded timber subsequently tested (a point to which we shall return subsequently) had similar characteristics to chengal timber was not a point in ATP’s favour. What was contracted for was, strictly, chengal timber.

20     The discovery that a small sampling of the timber (after it had been installed) was not chengal timber subsequently led to the issuance of the Architect’s Direction mentioned in paragraph 7 above. When the replacement as directed by the Architects (and communicated to ATP) was not ultimately carried out by ATP, SKC had no other choice but to procure the removal and replacement of the affected decking. As mentioned earlier in paragraph 8 above, the replacement was carried out by Cheng Fong.

21     As will become apparent, the failure of ATP to provide timber that consisted wholly of chengal timber was, in my view, the most important factor in coming to the finding that ATP had been in breach of their contract with SKC. To be sure, ATP were also contractually obligated to “make good” any defective work that had been discovered. As alluded to earlier, defects had begun appearing at a considerably early stage, barely a few months after completion of installation. ATP did not rectify these defective works.

22     It would have been impractical for SKC to have tested the timber, in situ, after the installation had been completed. As stated in paragraph 20 above, a small sampling then had revealed the fact that the test samples were not, in fact, of the chengal species.

23     As the events unfolded, it was ultimately discovered, by the expert employed by SKC (who gave expert evidence at the trial), that a very significant 44.5 % of the retained dismantled timber was not chengal timber.

24     There was a dispute by ATP as to the accuracy of this finding. ATP challenged whether the discarded timber which SKC’s expert had tested had indeed been from the timber at the project site which had been installed by ATP. Amongst other assertions pointed out by ATP at trial, the surface area of the discarded timber and the previously installed decking did not tally.

25     SKC’s explanation of the variance was that in the act of removal of the installed timber, there would have been some breakage involved. Some of the removed timber may have consequently been totally discarded and not subsequently stored.

26     Upon a consideration of the evidence on this point, I found that the discarded timber that SKC’s expert carried out his investigations on, was from the previously installed decking at the project site. There was no cogent evidence to suggest otherwise.

27     SKC’s expert had opined that of 1,538 pieces of the discarded timber he had inspected, he found that 684 pieces were not of chengal timber. Hence the finding that 44.5% of the sampling had not been of the contractually specified chengal timber.

28     ATP had also proffered expert evidence of investigations that indicated that ATP had indeed provided chengal timber. However, the sampling on the part of the evidence put forth by ATP was of a much smaller portion of the total discarded timber. This led to a finding that the expert evidence led by SKC had led to a more reliable and statistically realistic result.

29     I therefore accepted the expert evidence led by SKC that 44.5% of the timber supplied by ATP had not been of chengal timber.

30     ATP sought to rely on a certification by their timber supplier that the timber supplied had been chengal. However, this certification was challenged by SKC. ATP did not call their supplier’s representative to give evidence in their favour. This certification would therefore not be admissible, being hearsay.

31     ATP could not also reconcile the total amount of timber that had been supplied to them by their supplier. Their witness then gave evidence that they had also received stock from yet another supplier. Again, when the total stocks supplied by these 2 suppliers could not be reconciled in relation to the total timber required for the project, ATP’s witness then said that some of the timber might have been from their own stockpile.

32     This led to the clear position, that ATP could not show, through a proper certification of some form, that the timber they had supplied, had indeed been wholly chengal. We were therefore left with the conclusion, that around 44.5 % of the timber supplied by ATP was not chengal.

33     Contractually having agreed to provide wholly chengal timber, ATP were thus in clear breach of the contract between themselves and SKC.

34     ATP did not replace the decking, as it ought to have done. SKC would then have to act, in order to ensure that they would not then have been in breach with regard to their contract with the developers. It would have been impractical for SKC to have tested each and every installed piece of installed timber in situ, and then individually replace each non-conforming piece. Other than the practical difficulties in this form of rectification, such a process may well have affected the congruous wholeness of the installed decking.

35     Hence, SKC had to employ the method described above. Cheng Fong was unable to carry out the removal of the decking due to constraints on their part, so SKC proceeded to effect the removal of the decking. Cheng Fong then proceeded to install decking complying with the original requirements. ATP suggested that some of the re-installed decking comprised some of the removed timber. There was no cogent evidence to support this.

36     I found that SKC had acted reasonably in the circumstances they found themselves in. Clearly, what was to be provided for the decking was 100% chengal timber, which ATP had failed to deliver.

37     ATP sought to argue that the re-installed timber decking amounted to “betterment”. On this point I agreed with the solicitors for SKC in their Closing Submissions. In the final analysis, what ATP had provided and installed was simply not what was contemplated between parties and envisaged as evidenced in the contract documents. The individual house owners would not have enjoyed what had been contractually promised in the first place. No question of betterment arose for further consideration.

38     SKC’s final breakdown of the extra costs and expenses they incurred as a direct consequence of ATP’s breach was set out and itemised in the Closing Submissions. The total amount SKC claimed was the sum of $137,264.41. This sum was less than the sum of $157,532.45 claimed in the final iteration of the Statement of Claim.

39     The final claimed sum of $137,264.41 comprised 6 heads of damage and they are dealt with in turn.

40     The first head was termed “Cost of dismantling ATP’s defective timber” and was quantified at $12,740. Cheng Fong had manpower constraints and could not perform the dismantling works (and could only perform the re-installation of the decking). SKC therefore had to carry out the dismantling themselves. SKC’s claimed sum of $12,740 under this head involved the estimation of the man hours they required for this phase of the works (and the rental of a bulk bin for the disposal of debris). As no actual movement of monies from SKC was involved, I found that SKC’s estimation and calculation for this head of damage was fair and reasonable. SKC further asserted that the sum of $12,740 was reasonable, as, based on the quotation given by Cheng Fong, this part of the works would have cost SKC $19,359.45. Therefore, I found that the sum of $12,740 representing the work that had to be done by SKC for the dismantling of the unsuitable timber decking was reasonable.

41     The second head was for the “Installation of timber works” by Cheng Fong, at $87,421.92. SKC was faced with the situation where the developers would have engaged their own sub-contractors to rectify the unsuitable timber works, if no action had been forthcoming on SKC’s part. Thus SKC had no choice but to act in the way they did. Cheng Fong had initially quoted a rate of $290 per square metre. SKC was able to negotiate this price down to $212 per square metre. In all the circumstances, SKC had acted reasonably in engaging Cheng Fong to carry out the rectification works. I therefore found that the sum of $87,421.92 was reasonable.

42     The third head was compensation to the owner of one of the affected units (Unit 144) who had carried out the rectification works on his own. The sum involved here was $10,000. The owner of this unit had complained of cracks and scratches in the decking that had been installed by ATP. ATP had not rectified these defects. The owner of this unit wanted to use his own contractor to do the replacement works. SKC paid a sum of $10,000 to this owner’s contractor in relation to the replacement of the defective timber decking. In the circumstances, I found that SKC was entitled to be reimbursed this further sum by ATP, and I also allowed this head of claim.

43     The fourth head was for transportation costs to move the dismantled timber to a warehouse for storage. The sum claimed here was $1,539.20. As ATP did not transport away the removed unsuitable timber from the project site, SKC had to incur costs to do so. SKC had to incur rental for a crane to remove the timber, as by then, the units were occupied. The further costs involved under this head were estimates of the further transportation costs and labour costs. I did not find the total sum of $1,539.20 to be unreasonable, and so allowed this claim as well.

44     The fifth head is described as “(other) rectification costs {protection works, re-painting and cleaning}” and is quantified at $12,450. This sum comprises 2 separate estimated sums. The first sum, $5,970, is SKC’s estimate of the loss suffered by them as they had to “protect the flooring and finishes by covering them with corrugated sheets, and tarpaulin and plastic sheets” prior to the actual dismantling of the unsuitable timber decking. The second sum of $6,480 was the estimated loss suffered for actions after the dismantling works. These actions were in respect of the re-painting of “portions of the wall affected by the rectification works” and for the cleaning up of the “affected areas in the units after the replacement works were completed”. Although this head involved sums constituting estimated losses suffered by SKC due to the breach by ATP, I did not find the sums to be unreasonable nor inflated. I therefore allowed this head of damage as well.

45     The sixth and final head involved the 15% “administrative and attendance” fees as provided for in clause 11 of the Letter of Acceptance. Clause 11 provided that ATP had to make good all “(defects), shrinkage and other faults” during the defects liability period. If ATP failed to do so, SKC “may employ other person (sic) to carry out the work and all cost arising there from, plus 15% administrative and attendance fee, shall be charged” to ATP. This 15% sum amounted to $13,113.29.

46     The 6 heads of loss and damage had been suffered by SKC as a direct consequence of ATP’s breach. SKC was entitled to be awarded these sums as a measure of the total damages that ATP was liable for, as a result of the breach in the provision and installation of what had meant to be, chengal timber decking.

47     Therefore, I found that SKC was entitled to Judgment against ATP for the total sum of $137,264.41, interest thereon at 5.33% per annum, from date of writ till date of judgment, and costs of the action, to be taxed, if not agreed.
