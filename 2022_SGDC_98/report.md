## The prosecution’s case

### The victim’s evidence

2       The victim is the accused’s biological daughter. At the material time in 2009 she was between five to six years old (her date of birth was 13 February 2003) and was in kindergarten. Both incidents were alleged to have taken place in 2009 at the same time in the flat where the accused, the victim and their family were residing in.

3       The victim’s evidence was that on an afternoon in 2009, while her mother (“PW2”) was out picking up her brother from school, the victim was eating her cereal in the living room of the flat when the accused called her into the bedroom. Their flat comprised one bedroom, a living room and a kitchen. The accused was seated in the bedroom and using his computer. He was wearing only a towel around his waist. He asked the victim to sit on his right thigh, which she did. As she was sitting on his right thigh, the accused grabbed her left hand and used it to stroke his exposed penis under the towel. The victim testified that she “just let him do whatever he wants to do” because he was her father. She recalled feeling scared because she did not know what he was doing. After that, the accused put his right hand into her panties and started rubbing her clitoris skin-on-skin. She “just let it be” because she “didn’t want to disobey him since he was her father”. She felt “uncomfortable” as he touched her because it was her private area, which should not be touched by others. The accused was looking back and forth between her and the computer while all this was happening. At that time, the victim was thinking to herself as to what the accused had done was right or wrong. The accused then asked her to go to the bed which she did whereupon he stood in front of her, took off his towel and was naked. The victim replied that she wanted to go and eat. The accused said “okay” and told her not to tell PW2. The victim then left the room. PW2 subsequently came home with her brother. The victim did not tell PW2 on that day about what had happened as the accused had told her not to do so but she told PW2 about the incident about a month later.

### The evidence of the victim’s mother

4       PW2 testified that on a day in 2009 she had gone out of the flat and when she tried to call the accused on his handphone but he did not answer. When she returned to the flat, she saw the victim sitting at the sofa eating cereal and watching television. She observed that the accused was playing computer games inside the bedroom with a towel around his waist.

5       PW2 testified that two days later, the victim told her that the accused had called her into the room and asked her to touch his “thing” which she understood to mean “penis”. The victim testified that on this occasion, although the accused had earlier told her not to tell PW2, she did so as she wanted to know if what the accused had done was right or wrong. She wanted to know from PW2 if it was “okay to be touched there” given that the accused was her father and whether it was the norm for other children as well. PW2 told the victim to never allow anyone to touch her there ever again and asked why the victim did not tell her earlier about the incident.

6       PW2 testified that when she questioned the victim, the latter’s demeanour appeared worried and she kept repeating that she was telling the truth. PW2 was of the view that the victim was telling the truth as it was the victim’s habit to repeat herself if she wanted to tell PW2 about something that really happened. PW2 then told the victim to follow her whenever possible thereafter to ensure her safety.

7       PW2 subsequently confronted the accused to ask him whether he had asked the victim to go inside the bedroom to touch his penis. The victim was present and she recalled that PW2 said words to the effect of “If you love your daughter, you wouldn’t touch her inappropriately.”

8       PW2 testified that when confronted, the accused denied the deed. PW2 felt that given the accused’s denial, there was no point in making a police report as there was not enough evidence (which to her understanding meant having pictures of the incident) to prove the offence. PW2 also testified that she did not want to lodge a police report and told the victim not to do so as she had been through some critical moments at that time such as her son’s fall incident and she did not want to have to handle everything herself.

### Eventual reporting of the incident

9       The victim testified that at the time of the incident she did not know what the words “penis” and “clitoris” meant. She only found out the meaning of these terms in primary school through a sexual education class. Sometime while she was in primary school, the victim saw a video on YouTube about a girl who lodged a police report against her father 18 years after the incident. The girl in the video was suffering from trauma and the video explained the details of what happened to her. She then realised after watching the video that what the accused had done to her was wrong but she did not lodge a police report as it was a “very scary” thing to do as a child and she was obeying her mother who had earlier told her not to do so.

10     On 11 January 2018, the victim had a panic attack in school while she was having physical activities conducted by the school. She had panic attacks in school as she felt uncomfortable coming to school and disliked being around boys. When she had the panic attack she was brought to the school counsellor (“PW3”) who asked her what triggered the panic attacks. This led the victim reporting the incident involving the accused to PW3. The victim said that she told PW3 about the incident involving the accused as PW3 had asked her about what triggered her panic attack and she did not have anyone else to talk to. The victim testified that she had confided in PW3 as PW3 had given her comforting words to the effect that what she told PW3 would be between the two of them.

11     PW3 testified that the victim told her that when the victim was about five years old and was alone with her father, her father brought her to the bedroom, asked her to lie down, touched her vagina under her panties and also wanted her to touch his penis. The victim told the accused that she was uncomfortable and she told the accused that she was hungry and wanted to eat and then left the room. PW3 was not sure if that was the exact sequence of events as narrated to her by the victim.

12     PW3 then reported the matter to child protection officers from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“MSF”), namely PW5 and PW6.

13     PW5 testified that the victim had told her that when she was six years old, the accused had asked her to sit on his lap while he was using the computer, pulled her hand to touch his penis and put his hand into her pants to touch her vagina. The accused had then told her to lie on the bed and opened up his towel whereupon the victim found an excuse that she needed to eat and left the room.

14     PW6 testified that during the interview with the victim, the victim had shared that the accused had called her to go into the room where he was using a computer when she was six years old. He then asked the victim to sit on his lap and put her hand on his private area. He also put his hand on her private area under her clothes. Thereafter, he asked the victim to lie on the bed and opened his towel that he was wearing when the victim made up an excuse and left the room.

15     It was PW5’s supervisor who decided to lodge a police report against the accused on 11 January 2018. PW2 had in fact told the school counsellor PW3 that she did not want the matter to be escalated to the police. A police report against the accused was lodged on 11 January 2018 by the victim (“P1”) as well as by PW6 (“P2”). Pursuant to an arrest report of the same date, the accused was arrested on 1 October 2019 for an offence of outraging of modesty under s 354(2) Penal Code (“P3”).

### Evidence of the victim’s then boyfriend

16     PW9 testified that he became acquainted with the victim in May 2016 as they were schoolmates. Both were in a romantic relationship until mid 2018.

17     In 2016 the victim told PW9 that her father (the accused) used to touch her inappropriately. He shared that this revelation came while they were on a date and she “looked traumatised and her tone was very upset” when she was telling him about it. PW9 did not ask her further about it she looked like she was about to break down so he changed the topic.

18     PW9 testified that he had met the accused only once and was near the victim’s flat. He was sending the victim home and they bumped into the accused. The accused looked surprised and happy to see the victim and the victim spoke to the accused. PW9 did not hear what they spoke about. After the conversation, the accused told PW9 to take care of the victim and PW9 gave him a smile. From PW9’s perspective, the accused looked like he was angry but was in fact being playful about it.

19     Later in his relationship with the victim (sometime around 2017-2018), PW9 became aware through the victim that PW2 was not happy with the relationship. He said that he would have stopped the relationship if the victim’s parents had approached him about it but PW2 did not tell him specifically about it.

20     PW9 said that the accused had a WhatsApp discussion with him about the victim. That was PW9’s first encounter with the accused. He denied that the accused had spoken to him on the phone saying words to the effect that he would “take him down”. He did not recall any issue between the victim and PW2 over love bites. He said that he had not been confronted with allegations over hitting the victim and maintained that he had never abused her.

21     When PW9 was asked about his police statement D3 where he had stated in paragraph 6 that the accused had never spoken to him in person or by phone but that the accused had WhatsApp him once asking him how he was doing, he conceded that the statement was inaccurate. PW9 said that when he was called down to the police station he was shocked and could not remember everything that happened. He maintained that he had never spoken to the accused on the phone.

### Evidence of the school teachers

22     The prosecution called PW7 who was the discipline mistress of the victim’s school who testified that the victim had been disciplined with regard to a crude video someone in February 2017. Around the end of March 2017, the accused was not happy about not being informed about the crude video and made contact with PW8, the victim’s form teacher at that time. The accused came down to the school on PW8’s invitation. PW8 recalled that PW7 managed to assuage the accused that all the girls involved in the crude video had been disciplined.

### Evidence of the investigation officers

23     PW4 testified that he was one of the investigating officers assigned to the case and he was the one who recorded the accused’s police statement D2 and that he had captured completely what the accused had informed him.

24     PW11 was a police officer attached to Bedok police division and was the investigating officer for the case around June 2018. He testified that he had arranged appointment for the accused for a polygraph examination. Once he got the appointment date, he liaised with the accused to see if he was available to attend the polygraph examination. The accused declined but PW11 could not recall the reason given by the accused. PW11 testified that the accused did not request for a rescheduled date.

25     The prosecution adduced the accused CPF’s statement of his contributions from December 2006 to November 2009 (P4) through PW12 who was the current investigating officer of the case. P4 showed that he was working between February 2009 and May 2009 where contributions were made by \[SP\] Private Limited and between May 2009 and November 2009 where contributions we made by \[PS\] Cooperative Limited.

## Amendment of charges and prima facie case

26     At the close of the prosecution’s case, the prosecution sought to amend both charges by deleting the words “then 6 years old” as the victim could have been between five to six years old at the material time. The defence did not object to the amendment and the accused maintained his plea of not guilty. Neither the prosecution nor the defence sought to recall any witnesses.

27     I was satisfied that a prima facie case had been established on the amended charges (the defence did not submit otherwise) and I accordingly called for the defence.

## The defence

28     The accused was the only witness for the defence.

29     The accused testified that there was a day in 2009 when he was alone with the victim in the flat. PW2 had gone to fetch his son. The victim was sleeping on the bed in his bedroom and he was playing a computer game known as “Half-Life” when he heard her crying and calling for PW2. At the time he was wearing only a towel which would be rolled against his body and tied up. He was not wearing any underwear beneath the towel. The accused asked her to come to him. He told her that he was playing computer games and asked her to play with him.

30     He carried her up and placed her on his right leg lap. He had to manipulate a number of keyboard buttons to play the game with one button to bend down, one button to fire and 4 buttons to move. He was holding one button on the computer keyboard with his left hand and he moved his right hand to press another button to engage the fire mode for the game. The accused said that as his left hand was already pressing a button he would not be able to move the left hand and had to use the right hand to do so. When he moved his right hand by raising his right arm over the victim, and at that time his leg moved together with it and the victim fell. He grabbed her with his right hand and used his left hand to catch her leg. He then put her on the bed as that was the nearest thing to him.

31     After he placed her on the bed, he went outside the hall to lock the door by hinging it. He did so in order that the victim would not go out of the house. When he returned he saw that she was not on the bed and when he called for her, she told him that she was in the toilet. He returned to playing his game and he then heard a knocking on the door. He left his game and opened the door and saw PW2. He had to open the door for PW2 as he had hinged it. He did not tell PW2 about the victim falling off his lap earlier otherwise they would start “fighting” (quarrelling) and he did not want that to happen.

32     In 2012, the accused testified that PW2 accused him of molesting the victim in the victim’s presence. He asked the victim where he had molested her and she hid behind PW2’s back. He then said to PW2 that if she believed the victim he should go the police station and tell them what happened. PW2 did not do so and stayed in the house and asked him to go out. By 2012 he had walked out of the house in view of his marital issues with PW2.

33     The accused and PW2 were divorced in 2015 and the accused and PW2 were given joint custody of the children but the children were with her and he can only see them on weekends. He would return to the home about twice a month when PW2 would call him telling her that she needed somebody to cook, wash clothes or do repairs. He would also take his children out to eat or buy things for them.

34     As for his relationship with the victim after 2009, he would describe it was as father and daughter and there was no argument with her. However, in 2018 he found that she had changed. For instance, the victim would be the first to come down whenever he called but from 2018 she never came down and only his son would come down and she became very quiet. When he asked her if there was any problem she told him that everything was okay. One day PW2 called him and said that a guy \[PW9\] had “hammered” the victim and gave her love bites. PW2 was angry with the accused for allowing PW9 to hit the victim.

35     He subsequently met the victim at home and asked her what was going on between her and PW9. The victim simply smiled at him and the accused said that he wanted to have a meeting with PW9 and speak to him. The accused said that he could see the love bite on the victim but he did not see any marks where PW9 had hit her.

36     A few weeks later, when the accused was at the house, the phone rang. The accused picked it up and answered it. It was PW9 who identified himself and said that he was looking for the victim. The accused asked if he was the one who hit the victim. PW9 then put the phone down.

37     On another occasion, when he was going to work, he met his daughter and PW9 walking together holding hands in school uniform near his flat. As he walked towards them they tried to turn away from him and walk another way home. He went to them and PW9 greeted the accused by saying “Good afternoon, Uncle”. The accused questioned PW9 and asked if he was the one who hit the victim and asked in anger if PW9 wanted him to break his face. He asked her what would happen of she went to hospital and who would pay for the expense. PW9 kept quiet and put his head down. The victim was shocked and the accused then said he was going to work and left.

38     The accused said that PW9 did not text him as he did not have PW9’s phone number.

39     The accused recounted an incident regarding the victim getting into trouble in school regarding a crude video in 2017. The accused has received a call from a friend who told him that the victim had made a video which went viral. His friend sent him the video which involved three girls doing a hand sign and got angry. When he questioned the victim about it she told him that the school punished only her and not everybody involved. The accused got angry and said that he wanted to see the teacher. He went down to the school and said that he wanted to see the principal. He then met up with a Malay lady who was the vice-principal. He asked her why only the victim was punished but he was informed by her that everybody had been punished. They went to a meeting room where there were three other ladies, one of whom was a Chinese lady and a vice principal. One of them showed the accused a book and said that apart from the victim there were the names of three other girls in it and he was told that they were punished as well in equal measure. The accused then apologised as he thought that only the victim was punished. He was thinking that the victim had played him out and when he went home he gave her $20, $10 for her and $10 for her brother and he went to work.

40     The accused testified that he had agreed to take a polygraph examination but was unable to make the appointment date due to work commitments.

41     The accused stated that in 2009 he did not have a handphone as he was jobless (before he starting working for \[PS\] Cooperative Limited) and he would use PW2’s handphone.

## Prosecution’s closing submissions

42     The prosecution submitted that the victim was a forthright witness. She had no motive to falsely implicate the accused and she did not want to report what the accused had done to her to the police. Although the police report was eventually lodged nine years after the incident through the intervention of the school counsellor PW3 and the MSF officers PW5 and PW 6, this could not be held against the victim. Given her tender age, she could not be expected to have understood that the accused’s actions were illegal and to decide on a logical course of action in 2009.

43     The prosecution submitted that both sides agreed that there was an occasion when the accused and the victim were alone together in the accused’s bedroom and the victim was sitting on the accused’s thigh. The victim asserted that the accused molested her in the manner set out in the charges.

44     The prosecution submitted the victim’s evidence was unusually convincing and her evidence was corroborated by her mother PW2, her ex boyfriend PW9, the school counsellor PW9 and the MSF officers PW 5 and PW 6.

45     Although the victim had stated in her police statement D1 that she had forgotten what had happened, the prosecution submitted it was well-recognised the lapse of time may cause memories to fade and “no one can describe the same thing exactly in the same way over and over again” – see _Tay Wee Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1315</span> (“_Tay Wee Kiat_”) at \[32\].

46     As for the victim’s police statement D1 where she stated that she had forgotten all the incidents and did not want to attend any police interviews, given that the incident occurred ten years prior to the victim’s police statement being recorded, the prosecution submitted that it was understandable that the victim desperately wanted to put the traumatic incident out of her mind to concentrate on her N-levels. That she wanted to put this incident behind her was evident from the fact that she did not even want to lodge a police report in the first place.

47     The prosecution submitted that the defence’s case advanced at trial differed materially from that in his police statements and Case for the Defence (“CFD”) (“P5”). As the trial progressed, it also became obvious that the case put to the Prosecution witnesses contradicted the defence that the accused eventually advanced when he took the stand. The prosecution submitted that there was an abject lack of reliability in the accused’s evidence, where some aspects of his account during his examination-in-chief also differed from his testimony during cross-examination. The prosecution submitted that the accused’s defence at trial was materially inconsistent with his police statement D2 as material details of his defence advanced at trial were omitted from D2. The prosecution submitted that the reasons given by the defence for the inconsistencies and omissions did not stand up to scrutiny.

48     The prosecution submitted that the accused’s description of how the victim fell of his lap was not sound and that his attempt to impute motives to the victim for making allegations against him as baseless. The prosecution submitted that in addition to the internal and external inconsistencies in his defence, the accused also presented as an evasive and belligerent witness, asking questions instead of answering them or providing irrelevant answers to simple questions.

## Defence’s closing submissions

49     The defence submitted that there was no _actus reus_ for the offences and the accused had never touched the victim inappropriately.

50     The defence conceded that an incident did occur sometime in 2009 when the accused was alone with the victim and the victim was sitting on the accused’s lap while he was playing a computer game. At one point in time, the accused shifted his left arm to press something on the keyboard, whereupon the victim fell off his lap but the accused managed to catch her as she fell. The defence submitted that the victim could have misconstrued this incident as acts of molest. The defence noted that the first documentary evidence of the alleged offences in the form of police reports surfaced some nine years later.

51     The defence submitted that there were inconsistencies between the victim and PW2’s evidence as to when the victim informed PW2 of the incident and when PW2 may have confronted the accused. The defence also submitted that the victim’s account to PW2 and PW9 were not complete in so far as the narration of the incident was concerned. The defence noted that PW2’s evidence was that the victim had only mentioned to her that she had been made to touch his “thing” and nothing more. The defence submitted that PW2’s evidence as to when she had confronted the accused was inconsistent and unreliable as she had given different time frames ranging from 2 days to 3 weeks. The defence submitted that PW9’s evidence was unreliable as his police statement D3 was inconsistent with his testimony in court.

52     The defence submitted that the victim’s police statement (“D1”) where she stated that she had forgotten all the incidents stood in contradiction of her account of the alleged offences where she was able to recall in detail what happened. The defence submitted that it was “inherently incredible” from the victim’s explanation that a video on sexual awareness helped her recall specifically the present case against the accused.

53     The defence submitted the victim “nursed a deep-seated resentment against the accused” and offered several motivations on the victim’s part for making a false allegation against him many years later “arising from the animosity held against him for perceived and actual faults as a father”. These motivations were:

> a)     The accused criticizing the way she dressed;

> b)     The victim wanting to get rid of the accused’s joint custody of her;

> c)     The accused confronting her with her relationship with PW9; and

> d)     The accused alleged intervention in the crude video.

54     In explaining the accused’s police statement D2, the defence submitted that the accused’s evidence had to be understood in the context of coming from someone who:

> a)     misperceived the true nature of his relationship with the victim, not comprehending the depth of the victim’s resentment towards him;

> b)     was thus unable to understand why PW1 would level allegations against him; and

> c)     was trying to establish why he thought the offences did not happen.

55     From the accused’s perspective, he shared a “normal father and daughter relationship” with the victim. From his view, getting into occasional fights and scolding PW1 for her dressing and mannerisms, for example, were all part and parcel of a normal father-daughter relationship with its “ups and downs”, and was by no means perfect.

56     This was the context for why even by the recording of D2 on 17 January 2018, the accused still did not understand why the victim would make allegations against him. It was for the same reason that D2, D4, and D5 did not indicate the accused’s current belief as to the reasons why the victim would incriminate him.

57     In the accused’s attempt to maintain a positive case against the charges, he had relied on a singular incident which he can recall: the alternate narrative about how he had to catch PW1 when she fell off his lap.

58     The defence submitted that it seemed less clear that this incident of victim falling off his lap could conclusively be said to be the very same time as when the alleged offences were committed. The accused’s evidence was essentially that, based on his history of computer gaming and investigative prompts, the incident about the victim falling off may have been the instance referred to in the charges, namely sometime in 2009 when the victim was at home with him.

59     The defence submitted that if one were to regard paragraph 11 of D2 as a deliberate lie, then it ought to be accepted as a lie not borne from a realisation of guilt, but to prevent shameful information from being revealed.

60     The defence submitted that PW1’s evidence did not rise to meet the standard of “unusually convincing” in view of the victim’s shifting evidence, and her unsatisfactory account of D1, which were indicative of either a legitimate difficulty in remembering the alleged accident, or an attempt at accusing her father of crimes he did not commit.

61     The defence submitted that the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses does not sufficiently cohere with and corroborate the victim’s evidence. On the contrary, the varying accounts offered by the prosecution witnesses as to what the victim reported underscored the inconsistency of her evidence.

62     Taken cumulatively, the defence submitted victim’s discrepancies and uncorroborated evidence represented a systematic pattern of inconsistencies which severely undermines her credibility and the strength of the prosecution’s case and the accused should accordingly be acquitted of the charges.

## The decision of the court

### Evaluating the victim’s evidence

63     In cases of sexual abuse, it was often a case of one person’s word against another. In such a scenario, a victim’s evidence should be “unusually convincing” or otherwise corroborated by independent witnesses or other evidence so that it could be relied upon to be the basis of a conviction- see _PP v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”).

64     In _GCK_ the Court of Appeal explained further on what “unusually convincing” meant at \[88\], \[90\] to \[92\]:

> The “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is **“so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”**: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[38\]. In _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\], this court considered that **“a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’**” (citing _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\]).

> …Put simply, the “unusually convincing” standard **entails that the witness’s testimony** **_alone_** **is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt**: see _Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> at \[73\].

> \[emphasis added\]

65     In assessing the credibility of a witness, in _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Arthan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>, Yong Pung How CJ held at \[9\] that a judge can make a finding on based on some, or all, of the following factors:

> a.     The witness’s demeanour;

> b.     The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence; and

> c.     The external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

66     In the present case, while the victim was 18 years old by the time she testified in court, as the incident was alleged to have happened when the victim was five 5 or six years old, the court would need to account for the victim’s young age and her understanding of issues at that time which should not be measured by adult standards.

67     In assessing the evidence of child witnesses, the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 2</span> observed at \[97\]:

> We note in passing that in Canada, children are no longer regarded as a suspect category of witnesses. As the Supreme Court of Canada observed in _R_ v W(R) \[1992\] 2 SCR 122 (“_RW”_) at \[25\]-\[26\], the evidence of children should not be assessed from the perspective of rigid stereotypes, but on a common-sense basis. Each child witness, regardless of his or her age, should have his or her credibility and evidence assessed by reference to criteria appropriate to his or her mental development, understanding, and ability to communicate…

68     In _PP v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span> (“_Roger Yue_”) Aedit Abdullah J held at \[31\]:

> However, all this must be seen in the light of the fact that the Victim was at the material time a child of just 13 years, for whom training and competing with the Accused’s private rope skipping team was the centrepiece of her life and, indeed, her aspirations for the future. **While the average adult may be expected to react in a particular way – for example, to resist, report or complain about an assault as soon as possible – a child or juvenile cannot be expected to always react similarly**. **The thinking process, assumptions and viewpoint of a child or juvenile victim may lead to a course of action that may on its face appear unreasonable or improbable to an adult.** However, **the court must always be mindful of the reasons behind what may seem like unexpected conduct on the part of a child or juvenile victim, and should not measure a child or juvenile by adult standards**.

> \[emphasis added\]

69     In _Roger Yue_ Aedit Abdullah J held that the fact that the victim did not report the sexual assaults to anyone in authority till about five years after the assaults, and only confided in two of her former boyfriends and a relative along the way, “did not rob her of her credibility”.

70     In the present case, the victim was five to six years old at the material time and she would have had limited understanding of terms such as “penis” and “clitoris”. In my view, the fact that a police report was lodged much later did not dent the victim’s credibility as she had informed PW2 of the incident shortly after the incident which subsequently led to the confrontation between the PW2 and the accused on the incident. While there was a discrepancy as to when exactly the victim informed PW2 (whether it was two days, weeks or a month later), this discrepancy on the time period was not a material discrepancy given the passage of time. As noted in _Tay Wee Kiat_ at \[32\], “…the victim’s inability to specify precise dates and times does not lead to the conclusion that the charges are not proved.”

71     Further, the accused did not deny that PW2 had confronted him about the incident which led to the inference that the victim must have reported the matter to her before that in order for PW2 to confront the accused.

72     The victim had explained why she did not tell PW2 the full details of what happened as she did not understand the terms “penis” and “clitoris” until she was in primary school and instead used the word “thing” when describing the incident to PW2. In my view, the victim’s use of the word “thing” when telling PW2 of the incident was consonant with the victim’s age at that time and her understanding of such terms, and it would indeed have been less credible if the victim was able to use words such as “penis” when describing the incident to PW2 as a five or six year old child. In this regard, I noted PW2’s evidence who opined that the victim was telling the truth as it was the victim’s habit to repeat herself if she wanted to tell PW2 about something that really happened. I accepted that it was the victim’s viewing of a video about a girl who lodged a police report against her father while she was in primary school which helped her understand that what the accused had done to her was wrong as the video involved a father and daughter as was the case here.

73     As for her account of the actual incident, I find the victim’s evidence to be clear and coherent. When cross-examined by defence counsel as to whether she could have misconstrued the incident as a result of a fall from the accused’s lap, the victim was adamant that at no point of time did she fall off the accused’s lap and stated that it had never happened. When asked why she was able to remember details of the incident 12 years earlier she said that at certain timings she would suddenly be able to remember all the bad memories.

74     The relevant portion of her cross-examination is as set out as follows[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1):

> Q    Okay. That’s fine. This is \[the accused’s\] account of the incident and he believes, alright, he believes that you may have construed this, alright? Now, okay, this is not a question. So once more, you will---do you agree or disagree that this incident, when I say “incident’ now, I mean this supposed falling down and catching you from the lap, could this ever have happened? Or are you saying this never ever happened?

> A    Never ever happened.

> Q    Okay. You are free to---of course, you are free to disagree but I have to put it to you that, alright, that this---there was an incident in 2009 where you sat on \[the accused’s\] lap and as he played the computer game, you fell off, he caught your fall, he placed you on the bed, and that was all.

> A    No.

> Q    And I have to further put it that there was no inappropriate or rather there’s no sexual assault or inappropriate touching in any form. Do you---so do you disagree or do you agree?

> A    Disagree.

75     In re-examination, the victim emphasised that she was sure about what happened that day with regard to the accused touching her and the reason was that she would not otherwise have subsequently reported the matter to PW 2[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2):

> Q    Now, in the Cross-Examination, you were also asked if you were sure about what happened that day, this is referring to the incident with your dad---

> A    Yes.

> Q    and your answer was yes.

> A    Yah.

> Q     **Why are you so sure?**

> A     **Because I wouldn’t have told my mum a month later about it**.

> Q    Sorry, \[victim’s name\], I didn’t catch you.

> A     **Sorry. I wouldn’t have told my mum a month later about it if I wasn’t so sure about it. Like, if I was just making things up, I wouldn’t have told my mum right about it**.

> Q    And why would you not have told your mum about it if you were just making things up?

> A    I know I’m not that type of kid. I don’t dare to lie to my mum as a kid.

> \[emphasis added\]

76     She had explained in court that she did not report the matter to PW2 on the day of the incident as the accused had told her not to do so but she decided to tell PW2 subsequently as she wanted to know if what the accused had done was right or wrong as she did not know whether it was alright to be touched by the accused who was her father. The victim had also informed PW9 that she had been touched inappropriately by the accused and she recounted the incident to PW3, PW5, PW6 in substantially the same manner as her evidence in court.

77     The victim also explained under cross-examination as to why she did not make a police report after watching the video which made her realise that the accused had acted inappropriately towards her[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3):

> Q    Because it helped you give a sense, a realisation to use---the words used earlier in your EIC, there was this realisation that something untoward, something inappropriate could have happened?

> A    Yah.

> Q    But you said, even then you did not file a police report because you weren’t too sure what to do?

> A    Mmm hmm.

> Q    Am I right? Is that your evidence? You weren’t too sure what to do, “therefore I did not file a police report”.

> A    Yah.

> Q    Who---isn’t it strange, \[victim’s name\], that the---the very video that you have talked about mentions the victim shar---re---reporting to the police?

> A    It’s because, uh, I was too young, you know, ‘cause like I don’t want like to involve my family in it and like, I’m scared like if I were to report it myself, I will need an adult to accompany me which---

> Q    Alright.

> A    I can’t do that because my mum is not the type to want to get involved with the police cases and stuff like that.

78     This was consistent with her evidence in chief where she had stated that she did not lodge a police report as it was a “very scary” thing to do as a child and she was obeying her mother who had earlier told her not to do so. This was also consistent with PW2’s evidence who testified that there was no point in making a police report as there was not enough evidence (which to her understanding meant having pictures of the incident) to prove the offence given the accused’s denial. PW2 also testified that she did not want to lodge a police report and told the victim not to do so as she had been through some critical moments at that time such as her son’s fall incident and she did not want to have to handle everything herself.

79     Turning to the victim’s further police statement D1 recorded on 6 September 2019, the victim stated as follows:

> I wish to state that I was told that I am needed to attend an interview by a Prosecutor in regard to the case against my father, uncle, the mama shop guy and my ex-boyfriend. I have forgot all the incidents and is currently concentrating on my N levels this coming 16 September 2019.

> In regards to the interview, I do not wish to attend any interview or such with any officers. I do not want to recall whatever it is about the case. I have carried on with life and do not intend to pursue any matter against the mentioned people as most of them are out of my life. I hope Police understands my decision and not force me to attend such interview even after my N level.

80     In my view, D1 was not a statement recanting her allegations of sexual assault against the accused. What she had stated in D1 was that she did want to pursue the matter further as she had carried on with her life and most of the mentioned people were out of her life. Further, she did not want to be made to attend an interview to recall the matter as she was concentrating on her N levels which would take place slightly over a week after the statement was recorded. As such, D1 did not dent the victim’s credibility with regard to the incident in the present case.

81     The victim denied that the reason why she had delayed in making the police report was because she had one or more motives against the accused for making a false report of sexual assault against her.

82     The motives suggested by the defence which could lead to the victim making a false report were as follows:

> a.     The accused criticizing the way she dressed;

> b.     The victim wanting to get rid of the accused’s joint custody of her;

> c.     The accused confronting her with her relationship with PW9; and

> d.     The accused alleged intervention in the crude video.

83     To this end, the victim was candid enough to concede that while she resented the fact that the accused would make comments and scold her for her mannerisms, that did not translate into her making a false report against the accused[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4):

> Q    Alright. You resented the fact that he made---he could still make comments, may---maybe even scold you for your mannerisms?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Similarly, you resented him for daring to even intervene between you and your ex-boyfriend?

> A    No, because I don’t know anything about it.

> Q    Alright. And you also resented him---never mind, sorry. So I put it to you that you were in no---you had no good thoughts about your father and that helped you believed that he was---or rather that he did commit the offences against you?

> A    Disagree.

84     She had no issues with the fact that the accused had joint custody over her.

85     She had no recollection of the accused having confronted her about her relationship with PW9.

86     As for the crude video incident, the victim did not recall when the accused was present in school to witness what the teachers had said about her behaviour and it did not operate on her mind.

87     She denied that all these events caused her to resent the accused which led to concoct a false allegation of sexual assault.

88     In this regard, it could hardly be said that the victim was motivated to make a false police report on 11 January 2018 when her own testimony was that had it not been for the intervention of the school counsellor (PW3) and the MSF officers (PW 5 and PW6) she would have declined to make a police report[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5):

> Q    And if it was just you and the counsellor, you would probably decline to make a police report?

> A    Yah.

> Q    And why would you have probably declined to make a police report?

> A    I mean, even though I suffered the consequences of his action, there’s no point like bringing up the past.

89     Crucially, as I shall further discuss below, even the accused in his police statement D2 corroborated the victim’s evidence in this regard as he disavowed that there was any motive on the victim’s part for making a false report of sexual assault against him.

90     As for the alleged discrepancy between PW9’s evidence and his police statement D3 on whether the accused had spoken to him in person, PW9 had explained that he had given the police statement in a state of shock and could not remember everything that happened. In any event, this discrepancy did not touch on the more material aspect of PW9’s evidence which was that the victim had told him that the accused touched her inappropriately and that her tone was traumatised and upset when she told him about it.

### Evaluating the accused’s evidence

91     The accused’s evidence suggested that the victim could have misconstrued an incident in 2009 as a result of a fall from the accused’s lap as sexual assault.

92     Yet in his CFD dated 14 April 2020, the accused claimed to be unable to recall the particulars of any incident where he stated at paragraph 17 of the CFD as follows:

> As he denies having ever touched the alleged victim inappropriately, he is consequently unable to recall the particulars of the material time, viz. sometime in 2009.

93     However, in his police statement D2 recorded on 17 January 2018, he stated at paragraph 10 as follows:

> I can recall many years back when \[the victim\] was very small. I was at home with my daughter. I was playing the computer at home. I carried \[the victim\] and put her on my lap while I play the computer game. Suddenly, she almost slipped off my lap I managed to grab her. I then placed her on the bed and I continued playing the computer game. I cannot recall what I was wearing that day. It was during the day.

94     In his evidence in court, the accused was able to give an even more detailed account of the incident that day and how the victim came to fall off his lap. Further, he conceded under cross-examination that the victim’s left hand could have touched his penis accidentally and that he may have come into contact with the victim’s clitoris[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6):

> Q    Now, \[accused name\], I would appreciate if you listen to my questions and answer them directly. Alright? **So, essentially what you’re saying is that her left hand could have touched your penis accidentally, am I right?**

> **A**      **Yes, it could have, Your Honour**.

> Q    Sorry, I couldn’t catch that?

> A    Yes, it could have.

> Q    And in the process of catching her fall, did your hand come into contact with her clitoris whether accidentally or otherwise?

> A    I really, really, really don’t know, Your Honour. Because when you are catching somebody, saving, you are not thinking of other thing than that. It’s to save her and not thinking other thing than that.

> Q     **So, there is a possibility that you may have come into contact with her clitoris, am I right?**

> **A**      **Yes---yes, yah. That’s true. Possibly, yah, maybe my hand do that, go too deep in touch whatever, whatever.** That’s it. I have no feeling over my daughter, okay, and \[inaudible\] for my daughter I get very fed up. I hate it. I would die for her, I will protect her. Even though I’m really angry with her for doing what she’s doing but I still love her no matter what. That’s why I never go and find trouble with her, I never look for her.

> \[emphasis added\]

95     When asked to account as to why he had been inconsistent in his evidence with his CFD where he was unable to recall any incident at all, the accused claimed that he did not know what the CFD was for. To this end, Section 221(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) states that the court may draw such inference as it thinks fit if the defence puts forward a case at trial which differs from or is otherwise inconsistent with the CFD that has been filed.

96     In my judgment, the defence had shifted from an incident where the accused had grabbed her when she slipped off his lap while he was playing the computer in D2 to one of total denial as per the CFD to a scenario where he could have _accidentally_ contacted the victim’s private part and she _accidentally_ contacting his penis when he was trying to catch her after she fell from his lap and the victim could have misconstrued this as a sexual assault. Further, the fact that the accused conceded that the victim could had physical contact with his penis and that he could have had physical contact with her clitoris partially corroborated the victim’s account of the events.

97     At the same time, the defence of total denial seemed more consistent with the attribution of motives by the victim to make a false police report against the accused which the defence was pursuing vigorously.

98     To recap, the defence had submitted that the victim had various motives to make false allegations against the accused on account of the following reasons:

> a)     The accused criticizing the way she dressed;

> b)     The victim wanting to get rid of the accused’s joint custody of her;

> c)     The accused confronting her with her relationship with PW9; and

> d)     The accused alleged intervention in the crude video.

99     However, in his police statement D2 recorded on 17 January 2018, the accused stated at paragraphs 8, 9 and 11 as follows:

> 8     **My relationship with my daughter has been alright.** I will always provide whatever I can whenever she needs something. Whenever, she needs money I will give her as well. We can joke and play around with each other. I love her very much and she is my diamond. She is my only daughter. My daughter would come to me and press my chest area and say that I have a big breast because I am fat and short.

> 9    After that I would pretend that I want press her breast back just to scare her and play a fool with her. She would react by laughing and moving backwards. All these happened in living \[sic\] in view of my son. It was sometime in December 2017. **I do not have any dispute with my daughter in any way.** It is just that I was slightly strict with her because I saw love bites on her neck made by her boyfriend. Her boyfriend’s name is \[S\]. I even scolded her boyfriend when I saw them at the void deck.

> 11     **I don’t understand why my daughter would make such an allegation against me**. **Maybe it is because my ex-wife kept pressuring my daughter.** She kept telling that her father is useless person because I always like to go out of Singapore to find girlfriend. **Maybe because my ex-wife does not want me to have my son or my daughter.** I told my wife to allow to use one my children’s name to apply for a house or a rental house so that I have a place to stay. She kept on telling me that the children refuse.

> \[emphasis added\]

100    In the CFD, there was no mention of a phone conversation with PW9, any unhappiness that the victim had against him for his comments on her dressing and mannerisms and any unhappiness the victim had against him for being her custodian.

101    In the accused’s cautioned statement D4 and D5, he denied the charges against him and made no mention of any motive on the victim’s part to make false allegations of molest against him.

102    The defence submission was that from the accused’s perspective, he shared a “normal father and daughter relationship” with the victim which set the context for why even by the recording of D2 on 17 January 2018, the accused still did not understand why the victim would make allegations against him. It is for the same reason that D2, D4, and D5 do not indicate the accused’s current belief as to the reasons why the victim would incriminate him.

103    From the above passages in D2, the accused expressly stated that his relationship with the victim was alright and he had no dispute with the victim in any way and he did not understand why the victim would make such allegations against him. Further, he was attributing a motive _not to the victim but to PW2_ when he suggested that it could be because PW2 was pressurising her to make allegations against him. When the prosecution sought to impeach him on these inconsistencies with his evidence in court, the accused conceded that he had been materially inconsistent on the status of his relationship with the victim. His explanation for the inconsistency was that at the time of the recording of D2 while he _already knew_ why PW1 would make false allegations against him, he tried to protect the victim as his daughter and “cover that part up only” by giving the stated responses to the recorder.

104    I found that the accused’s explanation as to why he would lie to the recorder that the victim had no motive to implicate him as not credible as the victim had at that stage already made a police report against him for molest. In my view, it made no sense when he claimed that he was trying to protect her given her allegations against him.

105    Yet he proceeded to raise various motives against the victim at trial by submitting that that the victim “nursed a deep-seated resentment against the accused” as a major plank of the defence’s case. As such, I find that the accused’s credibility on this aspect of his evidence that the victim had motives to make allegations against him was impeached by the relevant portions of D2. Further, I would add that the evidence showed that the victim and PW2 were both reluctant all along to report the matter to the police and it only come to the fore when the MSF officers decided to do so after it was surfaced to them through the school counsellor PW3. If the victim had any motive as alleged by the defence for making false allegations against the accused, she would not have displayed such reluctance in making a police report.

106    The accused also conceded that the timings of the PW9 incident and the crude video incident indicated in the CFD differed from what he eventually committed to at trial. He had indicated that these incidents took place in 2018 in his CFD, but shifted his position and stated that these incidents happened in 2017 during the course of trial.

107    In my view, this was an attempt to try and fit the alleged motivations for the victim’s allegations him to a period prior to the police report being made by the victim on 11 January 2018. The accused was keen to emphasise in his evidence in court that it was in 2018 when his relationship with the victim had changed for the worse. Yet in his own police statement D2 recorded on 17 January 2018, the accused admitted that there was in fact no motive for the victim to make such a false allegation. The accused also conceded that he had failed to mention in his CFD two of the four motives for the victim wanting to make false allegations against him, namely the accused criticizing the way she dressed and the victim wanting to get rid of the accused’s joint custody of her. To this end, I find that the accused had embellished his evidence by introducing additional motives for the victim’s making a police report against him which was inconsistent with his earlier statements.

108    As for his employment status it had been put by defence counsel to the victim that the accused was often at home as he was unemployed in 2009 and found a job later in 2009 but it was clear from his CPF statement P4 that he was unemployed only in January 2009 where he then conceded in his evidence in chief that he was only jobless in January 2009. He admitted under cross-examination that he had been inconsistent on his employment status[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7).

109    In view of the various internal and external inconsistencies highlighted above, I found that the accused’s defence was not credible.

### Conclusion on the charges

110    On the totality of evidence, I found that the victim’s evidence was clear, credible and unusually convincing. I rejected the accused’s account that by his catching of the victim from falling of his lap, the victim had misconstrued this to be acts of molest. I also rejected any suggestion of possible motivation on the victim’s part to implicate the accused. The accused was accordingly convicted of both charges.

## Antecedents

111    The accused was untraced.

## Sentence

### Prosecution’s submission is sentence

112    The Prosecution sought a global sentence of three and a half to four years’ imprisonment, with six months’ imprisonment in lieu of 12 strokes of the cane as follows:

> a.     For the 1st charge where the accused guided the victim to place her left hand on his exposed penis and masturbate him, the prosecution’s proposed sentence was three and a half to four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

> b.     For the 2nd charge where the accused placed his hand in the victim’s underwear and rubbed her clitoris, the prosecution’s proposed sentence was three and a half to four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

113    In the interests of totality, the prosecution submitted that the sentences could run concurrently.

114    In applying the sentencing framework for offences punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code is set out in _GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> (“_GBR_”).

115    The prosecution submitted that this case fell under Band 3 of _GBR_ due to (1) the high degree of sexual exploitation; (2) abuse of position of trust and (3) harm to the victim.

116    There was a high degree of sexual exploitation in the present case as the offending conduct involved direct skin-to-skin contact under her underwear with the victim’s vagina and guiding her hand to masturbate him.

117    There was a serious abuse of trust given that the accused was the victim’s biological father. PW2 had left her with the accused when she went to pick up the victim’s brother. The accused took this opportunity to abuse the victim. The trust the victim placed in the accused was evident from her testimony that she “just let him do whatever he wants to do” and “didn’t want to disobey him”, because he was her father.

118    The offences were not reported earlier, because the victim and her mother did not think they had adequate proof. The offences only came to light when the victim was in Secondary school.

119    The victim was only five or six years old at the time of the offence, which was _at least eight years below_ the statutory ceiling of 14 years in s 354(2) Penal Code. As highlighted in _GBR_ at \[29(f)\], the enhanced sentencing framework did not intend to treat all offences committed on minors equally, and the aggravating factor of young age would still apply where the victim concerned was materially younger than the stipulated age ceiling.

120    There was harm caused to the victim as years after the incident, the victim began having panic attacks “whenever there’s a lot of boys”. When she was brought to PW3, the counsellor, the victim appeared “a little bit dazed”, “a little bit hazy” and “her face was blank”. The prosecution also submitted that the victim’s trauma was “evident in court” and when she informed PW9 of the incident.

121    The prosecution submitted that accused’s conduct during the course of the trial was a relevant aggravating factor. He had baselessly alleged that the victim was lying for a variety of reasons and when confronted with the absurdity of his allegations, the accused merely dug his heels in.

122    The prosecution submitted that six months’ imprisonment should be imposed in lieu of 12 strokes of the cane as there was a pressing need to compensate for the lost deterrent effect of caning, given the seriousness of the accused’s offending, see _Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ \[2017\] 5 SLR 0904 at \[66\]-\[67\] (“_Amin bin Abdullah”)_. The prosecution submitted that there was a need for young children to be protected in their own homes and allowed to grow and develop in a safe environment. A deterrent sentence should therefore be imposed to reflect society’s abhorrence towards the accused’s conduct and to send a strong message to any likeminded would-be offenders.

### Mitigation

123    The defence submitted that the charges fall within Band 2 of the _GBR_ sentencing framework. The defence submitted that:

> a.     the offending acts were limited to a single period of offending;

> b.     the offending acts did not appear to have been prolonged; and

> c.     there was no premeditation and sophisticated planning.

124    The defence acknowledged that there was a breach of trust in view of the accused being the victim’s father as well as the vulnerability of a young victim feature as aggravating factors applicable but that did not automatically translate into a Band 3 case under _GBR_.

125    As for the extent of harm caused to the victim, the defence submitted that harm was invariably inflicted in such offences, and the sentencing court needed to consider harm outside of that expected from the commission of the offence, such as pregnancy, the risk of transmission of venereal disease, and psychiatric illness, see _PP v BMF_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 227</span> _(“BMF”_) at \[41\]. The defence submitted that as there was an absence of any Child Guidance Report in the present case, the victim’s testimony was that she had not sought psychiatric intervention or medication, and that her panic attacks were now “more \[in\] control than last time”. As such, the defence submitted that without more, it ought not be held that the harm caused is in itself was severe and thus an aggravating factor.

126    Having regard to the precedents and the sentencing framework in _GBR_, the defence submitted that a sentence on the upper end of Band 2 ought to be imposed.

127    The defence referred to _BLV v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 726</span> _(“BLV”)_ which was a Band 3 case where a sentence of three years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was imposed on the offender under s 354(2) Penal Code for touching and rubbing the victim’s vagina with a finger, and attempting digital penetration. While the sentence was enhanced to four years’ imprisonment for the s 354(2) offences by the Court of Appeal in _BLV v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 726</span>, the defence submitted that the reason for the uplift was due to the Court of Appeal’s finding that the accused had abused the court process in falsifying evidence and procuring a witness to give false evidence: at \[83\]-\[88\] of _BLV_.

128    In the circumstances, the defence submitted that the sentenced to be imposed in the present case ought to lower to sufficiently account for the egregiousness in _BLV_.

129    The defence submitted that besides not penalising the accused for the mere act of electing to claim trial, his conduct at trial was not to the extent warranting an enhancement in sentence as he was a “direct person” who had difficulty understanding what was said.

130    The defence accordingly submitted that a sentence of between 27 to 34 months’ imprisonment, and three strokes of the cane, to be imposed for each of the accused’s two charges with the imprisonment terms to run concurrently. The defence submitted that the accused could not have foreseen that he would be exempted from caning due to his age but if the court was minded to impose imprisonment in lieu of caning, three months’ imprisonment would suffice in lieu of six strokes of the cane.

132    Under the _GBR_ sentencing framework, I was of the view that the following offence specific factors were applicable in the present case:

> a)     Serious abuse of position of trust. The accused is the biological father of the victim;

> b)     Vulnerable victim. The victim was five to six years old at the material time, significantly lower than the 14 years statutory cut off age for such offences; and

> c)     Skin to skin touching of the victim's clitoris underneath her underwear and making her touch his exposed penis.

133    At the same time, I note that both incidents went committed around the same time and there was no sustained pattern of conduct. Neither was any deception practiced on the victim.

134    In terms of harm, while the remarks made by Valerie Thean J in _BMF_ at \[41\] was in relation to harm in sexual assault by penetration cases, it was nonetheless relevant in the present case which involves sexual abuse:

> In other words, for this factor, the court looks for harm outside of that expected from the commission of the offence itself, such as pregnancy, the transmission of sexual disease, and psychiatric illness. There is no doubt that the present victim suffered physical and emotional harm due to the acts of the accused. This, nevertheless, is the very reason why \[sexual assault by penetration\] offences are treated with such gravity. In each case, harm is invariably inflicted. **It could also be said that the younger the victim, the worse the harm, which is why I took into account her especial vulnerability as an aggravating factor** (above at \[31\]). **The kind of harm which the law regards as an** **_offence-specific_** **aggravating factor is an especially severe category**: see, also, _Public Prosecutor v BMR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 270</span> at \[32\] and _Public Prosecutor v Ong Soon Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 58</span> at \[154\]. That particular level of severity was not present in this case. I therefore did not take the harm suffered in this case as an additional aggravating factor, but one that is recognised within the statutory delineation and punishment of the offence itself.

> \[emphasis added\]

135    In this regard, while I note the victim's evidence was that she had panic attacks whenever there was a lot of boys, there was no Child Guidance Clinic report for further articulation of the impact of the offences on her nor was there any evidence that the victim sought psychiatric intervention or medication as a result of the incidents. As such, I did not find the harm to be of such a level as to elevate it to an offence-specific aggravating factor. That said, as noted in _BMF_, the younger the victim, the more vulnerable the victim, and the fact that victim in the present case was only five to six years old at the material time was, to my mind, a material factor in deciding which Band of _GBR_ to place the case in.

136    The defence had submitted that the offences under s 354(2) Penal Code in _BLV_ where a sentence of three years and six strokes was imposed by the High Court were more egregious than the present case, even if one discounted the enhancement of the sentence in _BLV_ by the Court of Appeal for other reasons such as those relating to the abuse of the court process. The offender’s acts in _BLV_ included rubbing his penis against the victim’s face (2nd charge), licking the vagina of the victim (7th charge) and squeezing and licking her breasts (8th charge) and attempting to penetrate his finger into the victim’s vagina (9th charge). At the same time, I noted that the victim in _BLV_ (who was also the offender’s daughter) was 11 to 13 years old at the of the offences, and was therefore _significantly older_ that the victim in the present case who was only five to six years old at the material time. Further, in the present case, there was skin to skin touching of the victim's clitoris underneath her underwear as well as the accused making her touch his exposed penis.

137    In _BRJ v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 21</span> the offender pleaded guilty to an offence under s 354(2) Penal Code had licked and touch the victim’s nipples and toucher her vulva and shown obscene material to the victim. The victim was the offender’s neighbour’s child and was eight years old at the material time. The High Court placed the case as a Band 3 case under the GBR framework with 36 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the case as the starting point but the High Court adjusted the sentence downwards to 30 months; imprisonment and six strokes of the case as the offender had pleaded guilty. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the case fell within Band 3 of the _GBR_ framework and upheld the sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the case. I make several observations here. While, in _BRJ_ there was a degree of pre-meditation and planning and the showing of obscene material to the victim, the victim in _BRJ_ was not the daughter of the offender unlike the present case. Further, the victim in _BRJ_ was older than the victim in the present case, and the offender in _BRJ_ pleaded guilty (unlike the present case where the accused had claimed trial) which led to a downward adjustment of the sentence to 30 months’ imprisonment.

138    All things considered, as noted at \[37\] of _GBR_, a Band 3 case would usually involve a particularly vulnerable victim and one where there was serious abuse of position of trust. Both these elements were present here. In the circumstances, I placed the present case at the lower end of Band 3 of the _GBR_ framework with a starting point of three years’ imprisonment and six strokes for both offences (had he not been exempted from caning and it was noted in GBR that caning of six strokes was the starting point for a Band 3 case).

139    In terms of the way the accused conducted his defence, the mere fact that he claimed trial could not in itself be an aggravating factor, having regard the words of Yong CJ in _Zeng Guoyuan v PP_ \[1997\] SLR 556 at \[37\]:

> Certainly, an accused is entitled to raise any _type_ of defence necessary to his case, a scandalous – or even vexatious – defence notwithstanding. The scandalous _nature_ of a defence, nevertheless, cannot be an unqualified excuse for an unbridled performance in the courtroom. Of course, the accused must also be given some degree of latitude in the manner in which he wishes to conduct his defence; and in the large majority of cases, a rebuke from the trial judge would be sufficient punishment. In the case before me, however, the appellant showed a wholly exceptional contempt for the proceedings at hand. Indeed he seemed most tenacious in his determination to humiliate the complainant.

140    In the present case, I did not think the accused’s conduct at trial was so egregious that it demonstrated “a wholly exceptional contempt for the proceedings” such as to warrant an enhancement of sentence.

141    In terms of other offender specific factors, I did not find any other present which would warrant an adjustment the starting point of three years and six strokes.

142    The prosecution agreed with the defence that both imprisonment terms could run concurrently as the offences was committed at the same time. I agreed that the imprisonment terms should run concurrently as the offences were committed at the same time.

143    On a totality basis and given that both offences were committed as part of the same transaction, I adjusted the number of strokes from six to four strokes for each charge leading to total of eight strokes. As the accused was above 50 years of age at the time of sentencing he was not liable to be caned but pursuant to s 325(2) CPC the court could order imprisonment in lieu of caning.

144    In the present case, I was of the view that both deterrence and retribution were the dominant sentencing principles. As noted in _GBR_ at \[29(c)\], deterrence is a particular concern where there is an abuse of trust in an interfamilial context, given the difficulty in the detection of the offences and the considerable barriers faced by the victim in reporting them. This was precisely the situation here where the victim did not report the accused’s abuse of her to the authorities until much later in view of the relationship of father and daughter and her hesitancy in reporting her father to the authorities including the fact that her mother (PW2) had enjoined her not to do so. Retribution was also a dominant sentencing principle as the accused was the biological father of the victim and the offences were committed in the sanctity of her home when the victim was only five to six years old while the accused was supposed to look after her when his wife (PW2) and son had gone out.

145    In _Amin bin Abdullah_ the court held at \[65\] where the need for deterrence has been identified as the dominant sentencing principle behind the imposition of caning, there were at least two factors that should be taken into account in determining whether an enhanced term of imprisonment will further the objective of deterrence. First, whether the additional term of imprisonment was needed to replace the lost deterrent effect of caning having regard to why the offender was exempted from caning. The court held that generally persons exempted by age (as opposed to medical grounds) would likely to have known that they would not be caned and for this class of offenders, an additional term of imprisonment was called for. Second, the court should consider whether the additional term of imprisonment would be effective in replacing the deterrent effect of caning. One key factor would be the length of imprisonment the offence already carried and for offences with a long minimum term of imprisonment it was less likely that an enhancement would be an effective or meaningful deterrent. Given that the period of three years’ imprisonment was not exceedingly long in this case, I was of the view that an additional term of imprisonment would be effective in replacing the deterrent effect of caning.

146    As I was of the view that retribution was additionally a relevant dominant sentencing principle in the present case, the court in _Amin bin Abdullah_ held at \[70\] that where retribution was the dominant sentencing objective behind the imposition of caning, then the need to compensate for the retributive effect of caning lost by reason of the exemption would be a factor militating in favour of enhancing the offender’s sentence and this should similarly be considered with reference to the existing sentence. In this regard, as the existing sentence of three years’ imprisonment was not exceedingly long, I agreed with the prosecution that an enhancement of sentence is necessary to compensate for the retributive effect of caning lost by reason of the exemption under Section 325(1)(b) of the CPC.

147    Based on _Amin bin Abdullah’s_ guideline of up to three to six months’ imprisonment for seven to 12 strokes of the cane avoided, I imposed a term of four months’ imprisonment in lieu of the eight strokes of the cane avoided.

148    The final sentence imposed was three years’ imprisonment and four months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.

149    The accused is on bail pending his appeal.
