Civil Procedure – Judgments and orders – Application to set aside consent interlocutory judgment – Whether judgment can be set aside on the ground of common mistake of law

18 January 2022

### Deputy Registrar Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       This case concerns an application to set aside a consent interlocutory judgment. The applicant, the Defendant, submitted that the judgment was entered by both parties based on an erroneous understanding of the law. In essence, the understanding was that the interlocutory judgment recorded the Defendant’s liability for a motor accident but did not preclude the Defendant from challenging, at the assessment of damages, that the accident did not cause the Plaintiff to suffer any of the alleged injuries. Parties believed that it was open to the Defendant to mount such a challenge, until the recent Court of Appeal decision of _Tan Woo Thian v PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 1166</span> (“_Tan Woo Thian_”) clarified otherwise. In light of _Tan Woo Thian_, the Defendant took out this application to set aside the interlocutory judgment, so as to avail himself of the right to challenge the causation of the alleged losses _in toto_ at trial.

2       Having heard parties, I found that the consent judgment was vitiated by common mistake and set aside the interlocutory judgment. At the end of my oral judgment, counsel for the Defendant queried whether my judgment would be published as he believed it would be useful. As parties were unable to locate any written decision on whether a consent interlocutory judgment of this nature can be set aside, I decided to issue the written grounds of my decision.

## Background facts

3       The action arose from a motor accident. The Defendant’s vehicle collided into the rear of the Plaintiff’s vehicle. The Plaintiff alleged that the accident caused him to suffer neck and back sprains. He commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries and consequential losses.

4       The Defendant conceded that he was at fault for the collision. At the Court Dispute Resolution session held on 31 August 2020 before a Deputy Registrar, parties agreed to enter consent interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed. Specifically, the interlocutory judgment provided that the Defendant was liable for “100% of the damages to be assessed” with the issue of “causation of injuries … reserved to the Registrar hearing the assessment” (the “Interlocutory Judgment”). The Defendant submitted that while he accepted responsibility of the collision, he was of the view that the impact of the collision was not severe enough to inflict any injury on the Plaintiff. This was why “causation of injuries” was expressly reserved in the terms of the Interlocutory Judgment.

5       After entering Interlocutory Judgment, the action proceeded towards assessment of damages. About 7 months later, the Court of Appeal issued its decision in _Tan Woo Thian_. _Tan Woo Thian_ also concerns a trial that was bifurcated between liability and quantum. The appellant argued that the case should proceed for assessment of damages once breach of duty of care was made out. The court rejected this argument, holding that causation is an essential ingredient in a cause of action in negligence. In the absence of evidence of actual loss, the cause of action is inchoate (at \[6\]). In a trial bifurcated between liability and quantum, the claimant was obliged to prove that he did “in fact, suffer one or more types of loss that was _causally connected_ to the alleged breach” at the trial on liability (at \[8\]).

6       It dawned upon the Defendant that the Interlocutory Judgment was wrongly entered. The issuance of the Interlocutory Judgment, following the holding in _Tan Woo Thian_, implied that the Defendant had accepted that the Plaintiff did suffer one or more types of loss that was causally connected to his negligent conduct. This legal outcome was inconsistent with the factual premise upon which he entered the Interlocutory Judgment. By reserving his right to challenge “causation of injuries” at the assessment of damages, the Defendant thought he had made it clear that he did not accept the Plaintiff to have suffered any injury from the accident.

7       In these circumstances, the Defendant proposed to set aside the Interlocutory Judgment. The Plaintiff refused. The Defendant therefore proceeded to take out the present application before me.

## Discussion

8       Prior to _Tan Woo Thian_, it was common practice for parties to motor accident claims to enter interlocutory judgment by consent on the understanding that the defendant would be allowed to challenge the causation of injuries _in toto_ at the assessment of damages. This was often reflected by an express reservation in the terms of the interlocutory judgment, as was done in the present case. This arrangement was often pursued when the defendant admitted to being responsible for the collision, but did not admit to the collision having caused the claimant to have suffered the alleged injuries.

9        _Tan Woo Thian_ has however made it untenable for the Defendant to challenge the causation of the alleged injuries at the assessment of damages, insofar as the Defendant takes the position that the Plaintiff suffered _none_ of the alleged injuries (and losses) arising from the accident. In this regard, the Court of Appeal clarified that a claimant must prove _some_ form of loss or damage before the defendant can be found liable in a bifurcated trial. This is because damage or loss is a necessary element to a claim founded on the tort of negligence. Where the claimant suffers no loss or damage, the defendant is not liable, notwithstanding that the defendant may have been guilty of some negligent conduct. Conversely, the entry of an interlocutory judgment presupposes that the claimant has suffered at least _some_ loss or damage arising from the defendant’s negligent conduct. It follows from this ruling that the entry of interlocutory judgment forecloses a defendant’s right to argue that a claimant has suffered _no_ loss as a result of the defendant’s negligent conduct.

10     In light of _Tan Woo Thian_, the Defendant took the view that the appropriate course of action was to set aside the Interlocutory Judgment, so as to avail himself of the right to challenge causation of the alleged injuries _in toto_ at a trial on liability. The Defendant submitted that the Interlocutory Judgment can be vitiated pursuant to the doctrine of common mistake.

11     The Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant was still entitled to challenge the issue of causation at the assessment of damages, citing the decision of _Lim Mei Choo (Lin Meizhu) v Muhammad Azham bin Razak (Direct Asia Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd, Intervener)_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 74</span> (“_Lim Mei Choo_”), where the court allowed the interveners to challenge causation at the assessment of damages when they conceded that the claimant should be entitled to recover the costs of her initial medical consultation after the accident. It was apparent to me that the facts of _Lim Mei Choo_ are readily distinguishable.

12     In that case, the interveners conceded liability for _some_ of the heads of losses claimed, namely, the medical expenses for the initial post-accident consultation, notwithstanding its position that the accident did not cause the claimant to suffer the alleged injuries. In other words, the interveners took the view that the claimant was entitled to recover those medical expenses even if the court finds that the accident did not cause the claimant to suffer the alleged injuries. For this reason, the court found that the issue of causation could be reasonably disputed at the assessment of damages since there was at least _some_ loss or damage caused by the defendant’s negligence (at \[21\]).

13     In the present case, the Defendant did not concede any of the losses claimed by the Plaintiff. Counsel for the Defendant informed this court that the Defendant intended to challenge every single head of loss. Reference was made to paragraph 1 of the Defence, where it was expressly pleaded that the Defendant denied liability for the injuries and expenses claimed by the Plaintiff.

14     The Plaintiff further submitted that the Defendant had only reserved “causation of injuries” and not causation of “special damages”, which meant that the Defendant was only challenging general damages but not special damages, namely, the medical expenses incurred by the Plaintiff. In my judgment, this argument is overly arid and technical. Since the Defendant took the view that the accident did not cause the Plaintiff to suffer any injury, it should be open to the Defendant to argue that the Plaintiff was not entitled to seek medical attention and consequently not entitled to recover the attendant medical expenses. If the court finds that the accident did not cause the Plaintiff to suffer any injury whatsoever, it is at least arguable that the Plaintiff should not have sought medical attention and therefore the Defendant should not be made to bear the medical expenses incurred. No authority was cited by the Plaintiff to show that the Plaintiff has an _absolute_ right to recover medical expenses, regardless of whether the Plaintiff has a genuine claim for damages. If the interveners in _Lim Mei Choo_ conceded liability for certain medical expenses, that was the decision they made. As far as this case is concerned, the Defendant made no such concession.

15     In my judgment, it was plain from the terms of\` the Interlocutory Judgment that both parties were under the impression that it was open to the Defendant to challenge causation of the alleged injuries _in toto_ at the assessment of damages. Further, the Defendant averred this to have been the understanding in his affidavit filed in support of this application, and the Plaintiff did not dispute the same in his reply affidavit.

16     This was a mistake of law. _Tan Woo Thian_ had merely affirmed basic and longstanding principles of the tort of negligence. The Court of Appeal did not change the law in _Tan Woo Thian_. It appears that parties did not address their mind to these legal principles when they entered the Interlocutory Judgment. As a result, they entered the Interlocutory Judgment on the erroneous premise that the Defendant could still challenge the alleged injuries _in toto_. The Interlocutory Judgment, however, precluded the Defendant from taking the position that the Plaintiff suffered no loss or damage from his negligent conduct.

17     While courts generally do not interfere with consent judgments, it is nevertheless possible to set aside a consent judgment on the same grounds upon which an agreement can be set aside (_Bakery Mart Pte Ltd v Ng Wei Teck Michael_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 28</span> at \[11\], cited with approval in _Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 12</span> at \[151\]). Common mistake of law is a recognised vitiating factor. As the English Court of Appeal held in _Brennan v Bolt Burdon (a firm) and others_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] QB 303</span>, consent orders, like any other contract, may be vitiated by common mistake of law. It is a question of construction as to whether the alleged mistake renders the performance of the contract impossible (at \[17\], citing _Great Peace Shipping Co Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] QB 679</span> (“_Great Peace_”)).

18     Locally, the legal principles on the doctrine of common mistake are succinctly summarised in the Court of Appeal decision of _Olivine Capital Pte Ltd and another v Chia Chin Yan and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1371</span>. A common mistake occurs when both parties are mistaken as to the basis upon which they contracted. In other words, although both parties thought they were contracting with respect to certain specific contractual subject matter, it turns out that the actual contractual subject matter is radically different (at \[62\]). The court went on to cite _Great Peace_ for five elements which must be satisfied before the court can find that there is a common mistake sufficient to avoid a contract at common law (at \[67\]):

> (a)     there must be a common assumption as to the existence of a state of affairs;

> (b)     there must be no warranty by either party that that state of affairs exists;

> (c)     the non-existence of the state of affairs must not be attributable to the fault of either party;

> (d)     the non-existence of the state of affairs must render performance of the contract impossible; and

> (e)     the state of affairs may be the existence, or a vital attribute, of the consideration to be provided or circumstances which must subsist if performance of the contractual adventure is to be possible.

19     In my view, the five elements of the _Great Peace_ have been satisfied in this case.

> (a)     Both parties operated under the assumption that that the Defendant could challenge the causation of the alleged injuries _in toto_ at the assessment of damages. That assumption turned out to be mistaken. Parties were disabused of the mistake by _Tan Woo Thian_.

> (b)     There was no evidence of any warranty given by either party as to the assumption.

> (c)     Neither party alleged the other party to be at fault for the inability to challenge the causation of losses _in toto_.

> (d)     The mistake made it untenable for the Defendant to take the position at the assessment of damages that the accident did not cause the Plaintiff to suffer any of the alleged losses. Before _Tan Woo Thian_, it might have been possible for the Defendant to run that argument. _Tan Woo Thian_ has put it beyond doubt that such argument is bound to fail.

> (e)     The mistaken assumption was the fundamental premise upon which parties agreed to enter the Interlocutory Judgment, evidenced by the express reservation in the Interlocutory Judgment.

## Conclusion

20     For the above reasons, I set aside the Interlocutory Judgment. Parties agreed for costs of the application to be in the cause, and I so ordered. I also issued directions for parties to set down the matter for trial.
