### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This case concerns a set of proceedings brought by the State against the accused; Mdm Oh Bee Hiok, a Singaporean, aged 65 for her repeated and persistent failure to furnish information of her activities and otherwise thwart investigations after she had been diagnosed with a virus designated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (which is universally abbreviated as COVID-19). For the benefit of posterity, it would be _apropos_ to give a brief explanation of COVID-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID 19 is a respiratory disease that can affect other parts of the body and can range from mild to severe disease. Spread is mainly through droplets, touching contaminated surfaces, or in some cases, by airborne routes. Symptoms appear between two days and a fortnight after exposure, and include fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose or loss of smell or taste. Complications include respiratory failure, heart attacks, blood clots and other long-term problems[^1]. At the time of the completion of these grounds in end-May 2021, COVID-19 has infected over 170 million people worldwide and tragically claimed some three-and-a-half million lives. By comparison the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which was dubbed the first pandemic of this century, (which ran its course between November 2002 and August 2003) and which was caused by the SARS-CoV-1 virus, had infected 8098 people in 26 countries and claimed 774 lives. These juxtapositions are relevant, as the salient provisions of the Infectious Diseases Act were last amended in April 2003, while the earlier SARS pandemic was extant.

2       Mdm Oh’s course of conduct was so **_pervasive_** as to appear to me to be a campaign of active hindrance, and this was especially marked in her attempt to conceal her repeated and frequent meetings with a man whom she shared a close relationship, but was neither a member of her household nor a relative. Mdm Oh received a sentence of five months’ imprisonment, which she has appealed against. While the sentence was just one month short of the maximum imprisonment term of six months’ imprisonment provided for the charge prescribed, there are certain especially aggravating aspects of Mdm Oh’s offending which convinced me that the sentence would be appropriate as a fitting deterrent for Mdm Oh’s acts and conduct which could profoundly endanger the public in the setting of the present global pandemic, which Singapore, and indeed much of the rest of the world has struggled to contain. I was also satisfied that Mdm Oh was very much aware that her actions jeopardised those around her, even if her acts occurred at the nascent part of COVID-19 pandemic. These aspects of Mdm Oh’s offending and the attendant sentencing considerations will be fully set out and discussed in detail in these grounds.

### The charges

3       Mdm Oh entered a plea of guilt in respect of the following charge[^2] proceeded with by the prosecution:

>     (_Mdm Oh is_) charged that (_she_), on 27 February 2020, sometime in the morning, in Singapore, did hinder one Lim Ting Ting Jayne, a health officer with the Ministry of Health, in exercise of the power under section 55 (1)(e) of the Infectious Diseases Act (Cap 137, 2003 Rev Ed) requiring (_Mdm Oh_) to furnish her with information within your knowledge regarding (_her_) whereabouts and activities between 3 and 24 February 2020, in order to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19), _to wit_ **_by deliberately omitting information regarding your whereabouts and activities with Lim Kiang Hong (m/72) on 4. 6. 16, 18 and 20 February 2020_**, and (_she had_) thereby committed an offence under section 64 (a) of the (Infectious Diseases Act) read with section 55(1) pf t(the Act) and (_she had_) thereby committed an offence punishable under section 65 (a) of the (Infectious Diseases Act)

>     \[Emphasis added\]

### Charges to be taken into consideration (TIC)

4       Mdm Oh also confirmed her admission of the facts of another two charges and signalled her willingness for these to be taken into consideration (TIC) for the purpose of sentencing. Both are material to sentencing, with the latter of the two assessed by me to be far more significant in this respect.

5       The first among these two charges would be the second charge which stated:

>     (_Mdm Oh is_) charged that (_she_), on 2 March 2020, at about 2.00pm, in Singapore, did hinder one Low Mui Cheng Mabel, a health officer with the Ministry of Health, in exercise of the power under section 55 (1)(e) of the Infectious Diseases Act (Cap 137, 2003 Rev Ed) requiring you to furnish her with information within your knowledge regarding your whereabouts and activities between 3 and 24 February 2020, in order to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19), _to wit_ **_by deliberately omitting information regarding your whereabouts and activities with Lim Kiang Hong (m/72) on 4. 6. 16, 18 and 20 February 2020_**, and (_she had_) thereby committed an offence under section 64 (a) of the (Infectious Diseases Act) read with section 55(1) pf t(the Act) and (_she had_) thereby committed an offence punishable under section 65 (a) of the (Infectious Diseases Act)

>     \[Emphasis added\]

6       The other TIC charge was the third charge which stated:

>     (_Mdm Oh is_) charged that (_she_), sometime between 24 February to 10 March 2020, in Singapore, abetted by instigating one Mr Lim Kiang Hong to commit an offence under section 64(a) read with section 55 (1)(e) of the Infectious Diseases Act (Cap 137, 2003 Rev Ed) _to wit_ **_by telling the said_** (Mr Lim Kiang Hong) **_not to reveal your meetings with him if Health Officers from the Ministry of Health contacted_** (Mr Lim Kiang Hong) **_to require (him) to furnish them with information regarding your whereabouts and activities_**, **_in order to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019_** (COVID 19), which is an offence punishable by imprisonment and (she had) thereby committed an offence under section 64 (a) of the (Infectious Diseases Act) read with section 55(1) of (the Act) and (she had) thereby committed an offence punishable under section 116(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with section 65 (a) of the (Infectious Diseases Act)

>     \[Emphasis added\]

### Salient provisions

7       Section 64(a) of the Infectious Diseases Act creates an offence where any person “_in any way hinders or obstructs of assists in hindering or obstructing_” another “_in the exercise of any power conferred by this Act_The applicable functions for this case would concern investigations predicated upon a disease outbreak, or investigations to prevent the spread of an infectious disease :

> 55(1) For the purpose of investigating into any outbreak of suspected outbreak of an infectious disease or for the purpose of preventing the spread or possible outbreak of an infectious disease, the Director or any Health Officer authorised by the Director may-

>> (e)    require any person-

>>> (i)    to furnish any information within his knowledge:

>>>> Within such time and in such form or manner as the Director or Health Officer may specify, and may, if necessary, further require such person to attend at a specified time and place for the purpose of complying with sub-paragraph (i) or (ii).

8       The maximum prescribed punishment is a fine not exceeding $10 000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.

### Parties involved

9       As disclosed by the Statement of Facts, these were the parties involved in the aforementioned charges:

> (a)      **Mdm Oh Bee Hiok** (“Mdm Oh”), the accused person

> (b)      **Mr Lim Kiang Hong** (“Mr Lim”), an associate of the accused person, described as a “close friend”, age 71, whom she had met on five occasions between 4-20 February 2020

> (c)      **Ms Low Mui Cheng Mabel** (“Ms Mabel Low”), a Public Health Officer with the Communicable Diseases Division, Ministry of Health (“**MOH**”). Ms Low was an appointed Health Officer under the Infectious Diseases Act and empowered under s 55(1)(_e_) of the IDA to require any person to furnish any information within his knowledge for the purpose of preventing the spread of an infectious disease.

> (d)      **Ms Lim Ting Ting Jayne** (“Ms Jayne Lim”), a Senior Assistant Director with the Epidemiology & Disease Control Division (“**E&CD**”), MOH. Ms Mr Lim was appointed Health Officer under the Infectious Diseases Act who was empowered under s 55(1)(_e_) of the IDA to require any person to furnish any information within his knowledge for the purpose of preventing the spread of an infectious disease.

> (e)      **Dr Yang Yong** (“**Dr Yang**”), an epidemiologist at the Infection Prevention and Epidemiology Department of SGH, who saw the accused for the purpose of contact tracing and activity mapping,

> (f)      **Mr Sanjeev Kumar** (IO Sanjeev), an MOH investigation officer who interviewed Ms Oh and recorded a statement from the accused person.

## Statement of Facts

10     Mdm Oh had admitted to a detailed set of facts set out in the prosecution’s Statement of Facts[^3]. Bee Hiok, The facts show that Mdm Oh had been admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (“**SGH**”) on 24 February 2020 with high fever and was confirmed to be infected with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“**COVID**\-**19**”) on 26 February 2020. The remainder of the Statement of Facts is set out with minimal editing (principally on slightly differing naming conventions in these grounds) from \[3\], carrying the subtitle “_INVESTIGATION FINDINGS_”:

>     INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

>      _Contact tracing efforts with SGH doctor_

> 3    On 26 February 2020, Dr Yang Yong, an epidemiologist at the Infection Prevention and Epidemiology Department of SGH, saw the accused for the purpose of contact tracing and activity mapping, _i.e._ establish her activities for the period of 3 to 17 February 2020. The accused informed him that it was her usual routine to go to a wet market at either Bukit Batok or Bukit Timah every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to shop for groceries and have breakfast. She claimed that she did this alone, and other than these visits to the wet markets, she would remain at home. She also informed that on 17 February 2020, she went to see a doctor at a clinic near the wet market and was prescribed with medication. On 21 February 2020, she developed a fever but did not see a doctor and continued to take the medication prescribed by the earlier doctor. On 22 February 2020, she went to celebrate her husband’s birthday with the family. However, she did not provide details of the birthday celebration. On 24 February 2020, she went to see the same doctor again and the doctor advised her to go to the Accident & Emergency Department (“A&E”). Her son drove her to the A&E at SGH and she was warded as a COVID-19 suspect.

> 4    The accused did not reveal any other activity to Dr Yang. The conversation lasted about 15 minutes and the conversation ended quickly as she repeatedly told Dr Yang that she was tired.

> 5    As Dr Yang wanted to get more details of the birthday celebration, he spoke to the accused’s son and ascertained that the accused’s three sons attended the birthday gathering with their families. The accused’s sister also attended with her family.

> 6    Subsequently, Dr Yang compiled the accused’s activity map and sent it to MOH on 26 February 2020 for further contact tracing.

>      _Contact tracing efforts with the Health Officers_

> 7    On 27 February 2020, sometime in the morning, Ms Jayne Lim called the accused and introduced herself as a MOH officer, and explained to the accused that she already had the activity map from SGH and the purpose of the call was to verify the details in the accused’s activity map and to ascertain whether the accused went anywhere or met anyone between 3 to 24 February 2020, which were not reflected in the activity map. She told the accused that this was for the purpose of contact tracing since she was infected with COVID-19. She emphasised to the accused that she had to disclose all her activities during this period.

> 8    The accused informed Ms Jayne Lim that she went to _Bukit Timah Tua Pek Kong Temple_ for a Chinse New Year dinner on 7 February 2020 and was also there on 8 February 2020. The accused also told Jayne that she did not go anywhere much, besides her regular trips to the wet markets which she already told Dr Yang about. She did not reveal any other activity to Ms Jayne Lim and did not disclose details of where she went and who she was with during these market visits. The call lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.

> 9    At the time of this conversation on 27 February 2020, the accused knew that her grandson was already unwell since 21 February 2020, warded in KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital and tested positive for COVID-19 on 27 February 2020. She told Ms Jayne Lim that she was upset by the news reports on her grandson.

> 10    On 2 March 2020, while Ms Mabel Low was conducting contact tracing for another COVID- 19 case, she found out that the COVID-19 patient met the accused at the _Joy Garden Restaurant_ at SAFRA Jurong on 15 February 2020 during a dinner and karaoke event. Acting on this information, Ms Mabel Low contacted the accused on 2 March 2020 at about 2pm. She explained to the accused that she was a MOH officer and the purpose of the call was to find out if she had gone to Joy Garden Restaurant at SAFRA Jurong on 15 February 2020, why she did not disclose this earlier, and ascertain if there were any activities that were not in the activity map. Ms Mabel Low emphasised to the accused that she had to tell her any other places she went to or people she met during this period, which she did not tell the SGH doctor or MOH officer previously. The accused did not deny going to SAFRA Jurong on 15 February 2020. However, she insisted that she only there for a short while. She also refused to give details on her wet market trips and told Mabel that she visited the wet market as and when she liked, and would remain at home otherwise. The accused did not reveal any other activity to Mabel. She was also defensive and not forthcoming when questioned by Ms Mabel Low, and the latter had to warn her that it may amount to an offence under the IDA if she were to conceal any information. The call lasted about 15 minutes.

> 11    Thereafter, MOH commenced investigations against the accused for possible offences under the IDA.

>      _Discovery of multiple meetings with Mr Lim in February 2020_

> 12    Investigations revealed that the accused met up with Mr Lim on the following days at the following locations:

>> (a)    4 February 2020 (Tuesday), between 6.21 pm and 7.44 pm: _Sakuraya Fish Mart_ at West Coast Plaza;

>> (b)    6 February 2020 (Thursday), between 8.00 pm and 10.30 pm: Chinese New Year dinner at China Square Central;

>> (c)    16 February 2020 (Sunday), between 11.52 am and 12.44 pm: _Ya Kun Kaya Toast_ at IMM Building;

>> (d)    18 February 2020 (Tuesday), between 6.15 pm and 7.34 pm: _Sakuraya Fish Mart_ at West Coast Plaza; and

>> (e)    20 February 2020 (Thursday), between 6.12 pm and 7.32 pm: _Tonkatsu by Ma Maison_ and _Isetan_, both at Westgate mall.

> 13    This information came to light through a thorough review of carpark gantry records for the accused’s car and Mr Lim’s car, carpark CCTV footage, Mr Lim’s credit card records and all his call records during this two-week period from 3 to 24 February 2020.MOH officers also interviewed Mr Lim on his activities during this three-week period and discovered that he had met the accused numerous times during this period.

> 14    On 8 March 2020, MOH investigation officer, Sanjeev Kumar, met the accused to record a statement from her, in the presence of a mandarin interpreter. Throughout the whole statement recording, she did not disclose the activities in \[12\] despite being asked on her activities in this two-week period.

> 15     **_The accused finally admitted to the activities_** in \[12\] **_in her further statement to investigation officer, Sanjeev Kumar, on 9 March 2020._** The accused explained that she would usually meet Mr Lim on Tuesdays and Thursdays for lunch, tea or dinner, as she did not have to cook, and her husband will be away playing badminton. The accused deliberately withheld her activities in \[12\] from Dr Yang, Ms Jayne Lim and Ms Mabel Low as she wanted to keep her meetings with Mr Lim private. She did not want her family or Mr Lim’s family to find out that they were going out so frequently, as she thought that their family and friends would suspect that they were in a romantic relationship and spread rumours about them being in an extra-marital affair.

> 16    After the accused was admitted into SGH, she spoke to Mr Lim on the phone and even told him to keep quiet about their outings if he were to be contacted by Health Officers from MOH as she did not want people to find out about their meetings.

> 17    Mr Lim eventually tested positive for COVID-19 on 20 March 2020.

>     FACTS RELATING TO THE FIRST CHARGE (DSC-900336-2020)

> 18    On 27 February 2020, sometime in the morning, Ms Jayne Lim called the accused and requested for information on her activities from 3 to 24 February 2020 for the purpose of contact tracing. At the material time, Ms Jayne Lim was exercising her power under s 55(1) (_e_) of the IDA to require the accused to furnish any information within her knowledge regarding her whereabouts and activities between 3 and 24 February 2020, for the purpose of preventing the spread of COVID-19.

> 19    The accused deliberately omitted information on her whereabouts and activities with Mr Lim on 4, 6, 16, 18 and 20 February 2020 (at \[12\]) during this conversation with Ms Jayne Lim. In doing so, the accused hindered Ms Jayne Lim in the exercise of her power under s 55(1)(_e_) of the IDA, which is an offence under s 64(_a_) read with s 55(1)(_e_) of the IDA and punishable under s 65(_a_) of the IDA.

> 20    The accused admits to the abovementioned offence and stands charged accordingly.

>     \[Emphasis added\]

No other activities are revealed to Ms Jayne Lm and there was no further revelation of specific places the accused went to and who she had been with during these market visits Mdm Oh also confides that she is “upset by the news reports on her grandson” who had been diagnosed with COVID 19.)[^6]_

> _\-_ **2 March 2020** _(Monday)_ Third interview, conducted by Ms Mabel Low. Ms Choo, an official from MOH upon her discovery that Mdm Oh had encounters with another COVID- 19 case, at Joy Garden Restaurant at SAFRA Jurong on 15 February 2020, and revealing her role as a contact tracer, interviews the accused at 2pm.

>> _(Note: In the 15 minute interview, Mdm Oh is asked why she had failed to reveal having gone to Joy Garden Restaurant at SAFRA Jurong on 15 February 2020, and queries if she had partaken of any other activities that were not in the activity map, with an emphasis to clearly state any other places she had gone to or people she met during this period, which she had not told the SGH doctor or MOH officer previously. Mdm Oh does not deny going to SAFRA Jurong on 15 February 2020 but insists that she had been only there for a short while._

>> _The accused confesses that she had “deliberately withheld her activities_ (with Mr Lim from MOH officers) _as she wanted to keep her meetings with Lim private. She did not want her family or Lim’s family to find out that they were going out so frequently” for fear of inducing an impression among family and friends that she and Mr Lim were “in a romantic relationship and spread rumours about them being in an extra-marital affair”.)_

> \-**20 March 2020** (_Friday_) Mr Lim tests positive for COVID-19.

## PROSECUTION’S SENTENCING SUBMISSIONS

12     In characterising Mdm Oh’s offending to involve an “_extremely high degree of harm and culpability_”, DPP Jane Lim recommended that the maximum prescribed term of **_six months’ imprisonment_** be imposed against Mdm Oh. The learned DPP underscored the fact that very considerable outlays of “_time and resources have been poured in to prevent, delay and control the transmission”_ of the SARS CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Extensive resources had been expended, and the metaphorical sharp point of the spear for this national effort had been in the frontline health care officers who were committed to undertake contact tracing activities “_to isolate and contain the spread of the virus._”[^10]

13     Noting that the accused had initially faced no fewer than three charges before her acceptance of the prosecution’s offer to plead guilty to a single charge, DPP Lim justified her call for the maximum prescribed term by emphasizing the egregious nature of her offending. The salient parts of the DPP’s address on sentence are set out below:

> \[2\]    …**_Despite being fully cognisant of the present crisis and the grave implications of her actions, the accused refused to cooperate with contact tracers and obstinately concealed material activity information_**.

>     …

> \[6\]    The fact that the accused committed the offences when she was infected with COVID-19 is a serious aggravating factor.

> \[7\]    In concealing relevant information on her whereabouts and who she was with, she exposed the general public to the risk of being infected by COVID-19, a “dangerous infectious disease” in the Second Schedule of the IDA, without any means of isolating or containing the spread. COVID-19 is a highly contagious form of viral pneumonia which can be easily spread through droplets and/or physical contact with infected persons…

>     …

> \[9\]    In view of the nature and prevalence of COVID-19, the harm occasioned by the accused’s offences was extremely serious, both in terms of potential and actual harm. **_The potential harm in this case was high. The accused had gone to 5 different locations in Singapore with Mr Lim Kiang Hong (“Mr Lim”) which were all public places like eateries and shopping centres, with high human traffic especially since she went during peak periods in the afternoon or evening_**. Although there was no direct evidence that she had spread her COVID-19 infection during the 5 outings, the evidence shows that she had infected her grandson with COVID-19. Further, Mr Lim subsequently tested positive for COVID- 19 on 20 March 2020 as well…

>     {Emphasis added\]

### Submissions on sentence juxtaposing preceding case of PP v Chew Suang Heng

14     The learned DPP unveiled research that revealed[^11] only one other prosecution under section 64(a) of the Infectious Diseases Act having occurred during the present COVID-19 pandemic, which could be usefully regarded as a precedent under s that occurred. This was the case of _Public Prosecutor v Chew Suang Heng_ (DSC-900263-2020 & Ors) (_“Chew Suang Heng”_),

15      _Chew Suang Heng_ involved a gentleman, aged 78, who had rendered guilty pleas, and been convicted, on two charges, one under s 64(a) read with s 15(2) punishable under section 65(a) IDA for hindering an MOH officer in his attempt to serve a Home Quarantine Order on him and one under section 15(4)(a) punishable under s 65(a) IDA for failing, without reasonable excuse, to proceed to his place of isolation under a Home Quarantine Order. In relation to his hindering charge, a CISCO officer had attended at Mr Chew’s residence to serve the Quarantine Order on him but found him to not be there.

16     In that case, a CISCO officer had called Mr Chew’s mobile phone to ask him to return home. This was met with resistance by the accused there, when he refused to go home to receive service of the Quarantine Order. This was the subject of the section 64(_a_) Infectious Diseases Act charge. Mr Chew had compounded this by misrepresenting to the said officer that he was “_cleared_” by a doctor[^12] and hence did not need to be quarantined. This was of course not true, and Mr Chew had not been tested for COVID-19.

17     While the prosecution had called for **_four-month_** imprisonment sentences in _Chew Suang Heng[^13]_, the accused there was eventually sentenced to **_three months’_** imprisonment for each of the two proceeded charges, with **_three_** similar charges taken into consideration for refusing to return home and receive service when various Cisco officers came down on three distinct occasions between 10 am on 18 February 2020 and 11.08 am on 19 February 2020. Mr Chew was arrested in an open space car park in Toa Payoh Central at 6.25 pm on 19 February 2020 It bears noting therefore that Mr Chew’s period of offending spanned just about **_32 hours_** within 18-19 February 2020, as opposed to **_11 days_** in this instance. It is also notable that Mr Chew’s conduct appeared to have been triggered by a persecutorial delusion as evidenced by his verbal response that the CISCO officer had attended at his residence to “_make a fool of him_” before cutting off all communications with the officer[^14], and persisting with his avoidant behaviour thereafter. It is the case here that Mdm Oh suffered from no similar cognitive deficit or psychological condition at the material time, _albeit_ that she would assert being in a depressive state caused by distress and anxiety occasioned by her and her grandson having contracted COVID-19.

18     In _Chew Suang Heng_, the prosecution had not made any submissions on any sentencing framework for the section 64 of the Infectious Diseases Act offence. There had, nevertheless been a reference to a framework for the section 15(4) Infectious Diseases Act offence. The framework had been first propounded in the _Public Prosecutor_ v _Vardireddy Nageswara Reddy.[^15]_ I noted the close parallels between the two offence provisions within the Act, where there were common considerations predicated upon the proscription of certain courses of conduct and activities with a view to the effective management of public health crises and averting the exacerbation of such crises, where section 15(4) addressed breaches of Quarantine Orders and section 64 addressed acts of hindrance or obstruction of officers.

### Framework proposed by prosecution for offences under section 15(4) Infectious Diseases Act (for breach of Quarantine Orders)

19     In _Chew Suang Heng_, the learned DPP proposed the following framework for section 15(4) Infectious Diseases Act which addressed breaches of Quarantine Orders:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.9178164367127%"> <col width="44.3111377724455%"> <col width="44.7710457908418%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing Range</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Factors</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of up to $10000, or two months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Minor Breach and Low Culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two to four months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Minor Breach and Moderate / High</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">OR</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate Breach and Low /</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate Culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Four to five months’</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate Breach and High Culpability</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">OR</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious Breach and Low/ Moderate</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Five to six months’</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious Breach and High Culpability</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">OR</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Where offender is COVID-19</em></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>infectious</em></b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> \[Emphasis added\]

20     The proposed **_culpability_** factors for breaches of Quarantine Orders included:

> (a)     The offender’s reason for leaving specified place of accommodation.

> (b)     Whether the offender has symptoms associated with COVID-19

> (c)     Whether the offender had conducted himself in a way to intentionally infect others during the breach (e.g., by deliberately coughing into others)

> (d)     Whether the offender had acted with reckless disregard as to whether he would infect others during the breach (e.g., by not bothering to cough away from others)

> (e)     Whether the offender took precautions to reduce the risk of infection to others (e.g., wearing a mask)

> (f)     Whether the offender took actions to conceal the breach, including by giving false information to enforcement officers or during investigations.

> (g)     Whether the offender publicised or flaunted his breach (eg, by posting it on social media), and if so, did this cause alarm / panic.

21     The proposed factors for assessing the **_severity_** of harm occasioned by the breach included-

> (a)     Distance that the offender travelled away from the specified place of accommodation.

> (b)     Duration that the offender left the specified place of accommodation.

> (c)     Whether the offender had travelled to public places after leaving the specified place of accommodation, and if so, the nature of these places (e.g., whether these places have high human traffic).

> (d)     Whether the offender had contact with other persons after he left the specified place of accommodation

### Considering culpability and severity factors for section 64 of the Infectious Diseases Act breaches

22     In cases under section 64 of the Infectious Diseases act, I am of the view that the **_culpability_** factors where an offender has hindered the activities of designated officers by deliberate non-disclosure can be, _mutadis mutandis_, framed within the present context to be as follows:

> (a)     The offender’s reason for lying or otherwise misrepresenting her activities.

> (b)     Whether and when the offender knew she had contracted COVID-19 or had reasonable suspicion of this, having experienced or exhibited symptoms associated with COVID-19, in the context of non-disclosure of visits and activities during the period of actual or suspected affliction.

> (c)     The **_nature_** and **_extent_** of non-cooperation or deception of contact tracers (e.g. whether the offender completely “**_stonewalled_**” investigators, or did extend a measure of co-operation.

> (d)     Whether the offender had persisted in a **_pattern_** of evasive conduct of continued misrepresentation to different contact tracing officers (for example whether the offender selectively “**_drip-fed_**” incomplete information, and whether this had a misleading or misdirecting effect for tracing efforts).

> (e)     Whether the offender taken precautions to **_minimise_** the risk of infection to others by curtailing her undisclosed activities (e.g. limiting number of venues and visits, avoidance of crowded places, not visiting during peak hours ) or taken personal _prophylactic_ measures to reduce such risk of infection at the undisclosed places (e.g. wearing a mask or take personal disinfection and sanitising measures).

> (f)     Whether the offender took actions to prevent the uncovering of the activities, including **_inducing another_** individual to suppress information during investigations (As Mdm Oh’s instigation of Mr Lim to remain silent about their liaisons concerned a TIC charge, this aspect was **_not_** “weighted” in my **_initial_** analysis of **_culpability factors_**, but later factored as an uplift _per_ Public _Prosecutor v Elamparithi[^16]_. This is to obviate any possibility of double counting)

> (g)     Whether the offender had any **_personal_** experience or knowledge that would have given her additional knowledge or insight of the virulence and extent of morbidity of the disease concerned and the public health implications of her concealment of information.

23     The proposed factors for assessing the **_severity of harm_** of breaches against contact tracers ought include-

> (a)     The **_duration_** of the withholding of information where delays were consequently occasioned in contact tracing.

> (b)     Whether the offender had **_travelled_** to public places, and if so, the **_nature_** of these places (e.g., whether these places have high human traffic).

> (c)     Trip frequency and distances travelled by the offender for the undisclosed trips, and the activities and extent of interactions (**_proximity_** to crowds and involved counterparties)

> (d)     Whether, as a result of the contact with unrelated persons and involved counterparties above, **_infections_** were subsequently documented.

### Addressing the specific circumstances of the instant case

24     From a quick analysis of the crafted matrix, I would note that Mdm Oh’s manner and extent of offending would unfortunately, metaphorically speaking ‘_tick all the boxes_” of aggravating factors the cross axes of culpability and harm.

25     In her sentencing submissions, the learned DPP contended that while there were certain parallels[^17] between _Chew Suang Heng_ and the instant case, Mdm Oh’s extent of offending was of a far greater magnitude:

> 24    While there are similarities in the present case and _Chew_ in that the offences were both in relation to efforts taken to contain the COVID-19 virus, **_the present accused’s conduct is blatantly more egregious because the accused was tested for COVID-19 and was in fact positive, which meant that the harm (both actual and potential) that arose from the accused’s offences was undoubtedly more serious._** Further, the fact that the accused committed the present offences knowing full well that she was COVID-19 positive clearly puts her at a higher end of the spectrum of culpability than the offender in _Chew (Suang Heng)._ **_Further, the accused’s offences resulted in significantly more waste of public resources and the information withheld from MOH was actually material in the present case_**. The uplift of 3 months imprisonment is therefore warranted on the present facts.

>     \[Emphasis added\]

## MITIGATION PLEA

### Accused’s assertion that her judgment and conduct were influenced by her health ailments and mental state

26     Defence counsel’s mitigation plea centred on Mdm Oh’s stress and concerns which had reportedly overwhelmed her. In this regard, counsel indicated that Mdm Oh had also suffered from severe COVID=19 related symptoms at the material time, along with a number of pre-existing chronic medical conditions (which will be touched on below). According to him, Mdm Oh had suffered from cough, high-blood pressure, regularly ran a high fever, and also felt weak, cold and tired.[^18] On top of her acute symptomatic state, Mdm Oh had faced stressors which imposed additional strain on her[^19]:

> 12    To make matters worse (_Mdm Oh_) subsequently learnt that her 12 years (_sic_) old grandson had tested positive for COVID-19 as well having heard that COVID-19 might potentially cause brain damage, **_she was stricken with guilt at the possibility that she might have caused permanent harm to her own grandson. These were the thoughts that constantly plagued her mind even as she was fighting for her own life_** and she constantly broke down in tears.

>     …

> 14    It cannot be understated that Mdm Oh was already perpetually in a groggy state of mind when the incidents referred to in the charges occurred. She was approached by MOH Officers on 27 February 2020 ad 2 March 2020, while her COVID-19 infection was full blown, and she had done her level best to map out her whereabouts and activities over the preceding dates.

> 15     **_To make matters worse Mdm Oh was already incredibly afraid that she could die from COVID-19, and she was further stricken with considerations of guilt of having potentially caused permanent harm to her grandson and affecting his future._** Thus when (Mr Lim) contacted Mdm Oh informing her of his own concerns and worries, quite apart from being groggy and less than coherent. Mdm Oh did her level best to calm (Mr Lim) down and asking him to get some rest after hearing that he had not been able to rest well for several days on end…

>     \[Emphasis added\]

27     Mdm Oh had alluded to having suffered from profound anxiety but had only received a diagnosis[^20] of **_Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder_** after a consultation with Dr Lionel Lim, a Consultant Psychiatrist on 14 August 2020. Dr Lim had rendered a report on 16 September 2020 following her initial visit, which was rapidly followed by two reviews one week (21 August 2020) and three weeks (8 September 2020). It is notable that Mdm Oh did not have any treatment history with Dr Lim, and his report on the accused’s stressors material time seemed to exclusively be a recitation of a prior history recounted by Mdm Oh herself during her “_latter-day_” attendance in mid-August 2020. The account could thus not be regarded as any contemporaneous documentation of Mdm Oh’s state of mind in February-March 2020 by a professional mental health clinician which would be corroborative of her claimed psychological state at the material time.

### Accused’s medical history

28     Mdm Oh’s pre-existing medical conditions that would be beyond dispute would include hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, migraine, moderate gastritis, recurrent urinary tract infection, gastroesophageal reflux, past stroke, and _Myasthenia gravis[^21]_. Mdm Oh had been investigated by a magnetic resonance stroke-scan (MRI) for possible issues with blood vessels around her brain with doctors positing that the presence of a lesion around a collection of intra-cranial blood vessels medically known as the ‘_Circle of Willis_’ might portend Mdm Oh having small vessel disease or an evolving chronic infarct[^22] of the region assessed. While counsel had characterised these to be a ‘_plethora of unrelated conditions between end-2019 and early 2020_’[^23] I would note that **_none_** appeared to be life threatening or especially debilitating to have affected her capacity to understand and respond to the various MOH officers who had attended to her on the various occasions. Aside from being “_forgetful_”, Mdm Oh had alluded to her medications having “_under medication that made me drowsy_”[^24] The medical reports do not show any sedating drugs within Mdm Oh’s medical regimen. She was prescribed with _Cafergot_ (which can cause dizziness) for symptomatic relief for any migraine attacks, but never specified experiencing any episodes of migraine while she was being interviewed. There was also no indication of any medical condition which was beyond the ability of the Prisons Service to manage should Mdm Oh be incarcerated in their facilities, upon any sentence of imprisonment being imposed for her offences.

### Accused’s reiteration that her anxiety over her and her grandson’s welfare after contracting COVID-19 contributed to her conduct, do not help her case

29     All in all, Mdm Oh’s representations of her anxiety were a metaphorical **_double-edged_** sword. If the court were to accept Mdm Oh’s repeated reiterations that she had been distracted as she been fixated on her own fears of severe morbidity and death for her and her grandson, this would **_aggravate_** her offending utterly failing to co-operate in preventing the spread of COVID-19 to the hapless individuals she had been in contact with, as well as their family and friends, **_despite_** her personal experiences of symptomatic suffering and acute realisation of the dire risks of death and permanent incapacitation (including the possibility of brain damage to her grandson) brought by the contagion.

## ANALYSIS

### DPPs case for asking for the maximum imprisonment term

30     The learned DPP justified her call for the maximum sentence to be imposed by stating that that while the notion of imposing the maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment “_may appear harsh at first glance_”, the court should note that a custodial sentence of three months’ imprisonment had already been imposed in the case of _Chew Suang Heng_, which was at the mid-range of the sentencing spectrum. She opined that the case “_illustrates that a custodial term is warranted for such offences_ (i.e. those involving COVID-19 investigations and measure implementation)_, and the starting point for a less serious case is about 3 months_’ _imprisonment”_. Further, the learned DPP also submitted that case law made clear that the maximum sentence was not only reserved for the worst case of its kind but also applied to “**_a range of conduct_**” that characterised the most serious instance of the offence in question.

> 26    The maximum sentence prescribed for an offence is an indication of the seriousness with which Parliament views that particular transgression. The courts have held that the “maximum sentence should be reserved for the worst **_type_** of cases falling within the prohibition”: _Sim Gek Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 185</span> (_“_**_Sim Gek_** **Young**”) at \[12\] – \[13\]. This does not mean that the case must be the worst case of its kind but falls within “a _range of conduct_ which characterises the most serious instances of the offence in question”, taking into account both the nature of the crime, as well as the circumstances of the offender: _Sim Gek Yong_ at \[13\].

>     {Emphasis in the original\]

31     The DPP also referenced _Mehra Radhika v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 96</span> (“_Mehra Radhika_”) for the proposition that courts should not stint from imposing a sentence on the furthest end of the sentencing spectrum towards the maximum sentence when circumstances called for the maximum or a near-maximum sentence to be imposed. To do otherwise would be inobservant of the intent of the legislature which had set the sentencing level. In that case, Menon CJ had held[^25]:

>     …As a general operative background factor, if Parliament has increased the punishment for an offence on the basis that the mischief in question was becoming more serious and needed to be arrested, …, **_the courts would not be acting in concert with the legislative intent if they fail to have regard to this in developing the appropriate sentencing framework or if they nonetheless err on the side of leniency in sentencing_**…

>     \[Emphasis added\]

32     The honourable Chief Justice had also cited[^26] a proposition by V K Rajah J (then) in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> that a sentencing at or near the maximum of a statutory prescribed range of sentences should be done with an active “_sense that the sentence is_ **_proportionate_** _not only to the_ **_culpability_** _of the offender but also in the_ **_context_** _of the_ **_legislative scheme_****”**.

### The accused’s offending does not reach the extent of the maximum imprisonment sentence

33     It should be clear that the maximum sentence was six months imprisonment **_and_** a fine of $10 000. Hence the learned DPPs recommendation did not amount to a proposal for the court to impose the maximum sentence provided by statute, but merely the maximum **_imprisonment_** sentence. Ultimately, I was not convinced that Mdm Oh’s offending merited the sentence recommended by the learned DPP, bearing in mind her guilty plea and her lack of antecedents. For the former, she had indeed rendered a plea of guilt, albeit that this was on 8 January 2021, some seven months after she had been charged in June 2020. I would imagine that some savings in time would have been afforded by Mdm Oh eschewing taking the case to trial, not least the time saved by the four involved MOH officers; Ms Mabel Low, Ms Jayne Lim, Dr Yang and IO Sanjeev Kumar, who would have had to be blocked off their essential occupational duties to provide their testimonies in court.

### Considering legislative history to discern the legislative scheme for the penalty provision

34     Looking now in the perspective of the legislative scheme upon which the penalties were framed, which was underscored to be especially salient by the honourable Chief Justice in _Mehra Radhika_, I would note that the punishment provision was amended in 2003, _vide_ Act 7 of 2003. The amendment to the offence-creating provision (section 64) and the general punishment provision (section 65) had come into effect on 27 April 2003, as purposeful amendments in the wake of the sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic[^27]. The urgency of these amendments was apparent by the fact that the amendments followed an earlier set of amendments[^28] enacted in March 2003 in respect of different provisions of the Act.

35     The earlier provisions are set out below. Section 64 was drafted without any subsections, with subsection (b) (“_being required to provide any information or documents under this Act ((b) including as a condition of any order, notice or requirement made or given), provides any information or document which he knows to be false or misleading_”) only coming into being after the amendment. It would be **_especially_** salient to note that prior version of section 65 had **_no_** custodial penalty for a first offence, with only second and subsequent offenders being penalised by an imprisonment term[^29]:

>      **Obstruction of officers**

> 64.    Any person who wilfully obstructs or assists in obstructing any officer in the execution of any powers conferred by or pursuant to this Act or any regulations made thereunder shall be guilty of an offence.

>      **General penalty for offences**

> 65.    Any person who is guilty of an offence under this Act for which no penalty is otherwise **_prescribed shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000_** and, in the case of **_a second or subsequent like offence, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both_**.

>     \[Emphasis added\]

### Amendment in 2003 for custodial penalties to apply to first offenders was in the milieu of the SARS outbreak

36     The rationale was elucidated by then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang on 25 April 2003 in the following unequivocal terms[^30]:

>     Let me now turn to the section on increase in penalties. The provisions under the Infectious Diseases Act have been enacted after careful consideration in order to protect the public health. **_Offences under the Act are serious and can potentially endanger the lives of many people._** **_We want to impress upon all Singaporeans_** **_of the seriousness with which we take the protection of public health_**. The Bill amends the Act to raise the general penalty for those who commit an offence under the Act from $5,000 to $10,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months for the first offence upon conviction and in the case of a second conviction, the penalty has been raised to $20,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months…

>     \[Emphasis added\]

### Juxtaposition of the SARS and COVID-19 pandemics

37     The amendments and the accompanying explanation by the Health Minister showed SARS to be a veritable wake-up-call to the dangers posed by obstructive behaviour of infected individuals and those otherwise connected with efforts to suppress the contagion. The rapid infectivity of SARS from person to person on an **_exponential_** basis, in successive cycles of infection, would have shown that there was no time to waste in efforts to suppress the epidemic, whether by quarantine efforts or in ascertaining who the infected individual had been proximally close to known infected individuals, with a view to sequestering these connected individuals. The urgency forced by the then SARS pandemic resulted in an **_upgrading_** of the armamentarium of penalties to allow for imprisonment of **_first_** offenders.

38     The reason is quite plain, which is that the sanction of imprisonment would be regarded as an **_exemplary_** (and perhaps inevitable) deterrent to prevent the most aggravated instances of obstruction or hindrance of efforts of public officers tasked to suppress a pandemic. Because strict compliance within the population was an indispensable requirement, the threat of imprisonment for even first offenders was deemed a necessity to procure their co-operation and quash individualistic or selfish impulses to flout health protocols and detection regimes set in place to contain the contagion.

39     It is quite axiomatic that no one can **_negotiate_** with a virus, and the only the conduct of individuals within a population would be **_malleable_**, by the threat of such potential penal sanctions, to being persuaded to make adjustments to their behaviour for the greater good, in this context, by conscientiously observing regulations and laws put in place for collective public safety. The SARS outbreak would have taught that detection efforts in such contagions to be intensely **_time-sensitive_** endeavours, and that dire consequences could ensue from delays in contact tracing and the efficient sequestration of infected individuals.

### COVID 19 is a far more complex crisis with more profound consequences upon breaches of measures or obstruction of investigations

40     The COVID-19 disease is an exponentially more complex pandemic than SARS, with multi-faceted aspects of individual and societal harm caused. The potential damage from a failure to trace infectious individuals is vastly increased in the COVID-19 pandemic, as a super-spreading event triggered by a **_single_** individual can lead to the onset of a new wave of infections, as has occurred in notable instances in various cities in recent history. It also the case that the damage from COVID-19 extends far beyond the realm of human suffering and mortality caused by the physical disease, but also results in profound collateral social and economic harm from lockdowns and closed borders, which in turn would result in disrupted supply chains and suppressed economic activity.

### The primacy of deterrence

41     Given this, acts of hindrance or obstruction calculated to sabotage contact tracing efforts must be decisively and effectively deterred. Mdm Oh’s counsel has stressed that from the admitted facts, her offence occurred early in the pandemic straddling 11 days between in late February to early March 2020, and she would not have understood the dimensions of the disease, and thus the full implications of her acts of hindrance in contact tracing. It should, nevertheless, be noted that the COVID-19 caseload in just China alone on 26 February 2020, which was the day she was first interviewed by MOH officials (by Dr Yang in that instance), was 78 497 cases, which was **_ten times_** the worldwide caseload of the entire SARS pandemic. The mortality level for China would have already reached 2 744 deaths on 26 February 2020.

42     Counsel had in his mitigation plea, asked for Mdm Oh to be fined instead, and had no compunction in recommending that the **_maximum fine_** be imposed. The problem of course was that the accused’s offending had crossed well **_ove_**r the custodial threshold. As elaborated on in the preceding part of these grounds, a custodial penalty stands as a highly efficacious deterrent where the offences concerned could potentially eventuate in deleterious consequences. By the same token, the sting of deterrence would be severely adulterated if the well-heeled can escape the appropriate consequences of their criminal conduct by paying a fine. It should never be the case where offenders with the wherewithal might expect that, when caught, their criminal acts can be resolved by pecuniary penalties, and thus embolden them to take risk.

43     Given the propensity of exponential spread, and the fact that **_both_** Mdm Oh and her associate: Mr Lim Kiang Hong contracted COVID-19, _(albeit_ that their respective infections was diagnosed at different points of time between 24-26 February and 20 March 2020) was significant. This was in terms of **_potential_** harm that could have eventuated had the contract tracers been thrown off the trail, and Mdm Oh had successfully suppressed the discovery of her meetings with Mr Lim. In such a scenario, Mr Lim would have effectively slipped the net and escaped being tested for COVID-19, with the result that his own infection being undetected as he remained at large in the community until he was beset by debilitating COVID-19 symptoms himself. This would have unfortunately resulted in the community being exposed to a prolonged risk of local transmission for a full **_11 days_** as Mdm Oh held off disclosing the critical detail that she had seen him on no fewer than five occasions between 4 February 20202 to 20 February 2020. It would of course not be possible to definitively say that Mdm Oh infected Mr Lim.

44     Conversely, it would also not be possible to **_exclude_** the possibility that Mdm Oh infected Mr Lim even if their diagnoses were separated by 25 days. Medical knowledge of the period of an infected person’s possible infectivity is an **_evolving_** science, as demonstrated by the adjustment of the quarantine period from 14 days to 21 days in late April 2021 for incoming individuals from certain high-risk countries. Additionally, I would note reportage of isolated instances of individuals testing positive despite their apparent isolation from likely sources of infection for periods of time beyond these parameters.

45     Given that this aspect of study of COVID-19 spread being properly the province of medical experts, I would not venture to express any view of the connection between Mdm Oh’s and Mr Lim’s respective bouts of COVID-19. It would suffice for me to observe that her actions deprived MOH investigators an opportunity to conduct timely investigations and isolate individuals whom Mdm Oh had interacted with, who **_might_** have been at risk of being infectious, and concomitantly, of passing on the infection to other individuals. I would therefore broadly agree with the learned DPP’s contention that[^31]:

> 10    The actual harm in the present case is also very serious – the accused’s omissions **_undermined MOH’s contact tracing efforts to identify and isolate potential COVID-19 cases sooner and expeditiously._** Moreover, the fact that she withheld such information was also detrimental to the public – **_withholding such information_** (was) **_irresponsible_** (and) **_meant that members of the public were kept in the dark on at-risk locations, and results in some degree of social harm_**.

>     \[Emphasis and bracketed words added\]

### The accused’s persistence and obduracy also necessitated the deployment of four public officers and wasted public resources

46     Moving on to considerations of culpability, it counted against Mdm Oh that she had effectively ‘drip-fed’ information to the various investigators, and of course persistently maintained a false picture in refusing to disclose her repeated excursions with Mr Lim even as she gave a succession of revelations of her other activities, generally after close questioning by the investigators after new leads were received from their other investigations. While the instances have been described in the foregoing, it would be apposite to set the instances out with a brief commentary to give a sense of her persistence as well as the nature and extent of her non-cooperation, despite the successive efforts made by four officers, and in circumstances where there ought have been no doubt of the **_gravity_** and **_urgency_** of the subject matter of the investigation. This will also demonstrate the sheer wastage of investigative resources eventuating from her intransigence. The sequence of her non-disclosure would be as follows:

> (a)     Mdm Oh had first been interviewed on 26 February 2020, by Dr Yang Yong, an epidemiologist at the Infection Prevention and Epidemiology Department of SGH, who saw the accused for the purpose of contact tracing and activity mapping. Mdm Oh had shared only the most meagre of details with Dr Yang and only revealed marketing activities and visits to the General Practitioner to him. The latter disclosure would have been patently obvious This was the **_first_** instance where she had omitted her outings with Mr Lim

> (b)     Mdm Oh had on 27 February 2020 next been interviewed by Ms Jayne Lim a Senior Assistant Director with the Epidemiology & Disease Control Division. Given that this successive interview was conducted just just **_one day_** later, where Ms Lim had given specific directions to furnish her activity information, the gravity of the contact tracing endeavour should have been obvious to Mdm Oh. Notwithstanding this, Mdm Oh had simply added her temple visits, but eschewed this **_second_** chance to come clean in relation to her dealings with Mr Lim.

> (c)     Mdm Oh had been contacted by Ms Mabel Low a Public Health Officer with the Communicable Diseases Division, Ministry of Health on 2 March 2020. This was after Mdm Oh had been found by separate investigations to have attended at the Joy Garden Restaurant at SAFRA Jurong. Ms Mabel Low had directly confronted her with evidence on her attendance at the Joy Garden Restaurant and warned that concealing information could amount to an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Mdm Oh had admitted having been “_defensive_” on this occasion. More significantly, this was the **_third_** occasion that she had omitted her outings with Mr Lim.

> (d)     Mdm Oh had on 8 March 2020 been approached by MOH investigation officer, Sanjeev Kumar, after investigations were commenced against her for having omitted all reference of her association with Mr Lim. Mdm Oh would have had little basis for doubt of the gravity of the situation given that a statement was recorded from her in the presence of a Mandarin interpreter. She had again persisted to deny her outings with Mr Lim on this **_fourth_** occasion.

> (e)     Mdm Oh had again seem IO Sanjeev on 9 March 2020, where she had been confronted with the accumulated documentary evidence. It would thus appear that Mdm Oh had only conceded to admit their association was only when it became all too evident that further denials would be **_futile_**. Mdm Oh had accordingly finally conceded to her association with Mr Lim in the second statement IO Sanjeev had recorded, on her fifth interaction with MOM officers.

### Wastage of investigative resources

47     The above would show that the frenetic attempts to trace Mdm Oh’s contacts would have, as a result of her blatantly obstructive conduct, consumed considerable public resources. This wanton wastage is all the more regrettable by the fact that these had occurred at the especially delicate period of the early days of the pandemic, at a time of mounting cases, where such resources were particularly precious. Besides an SGH doctor, the contact tracing efforts, had included two MOH health officers tasked to establish her activities. After Mdm Oh had roused the suspicions of the officers who then focused on a forensic examination of “_voluminous carpark gantry records on the accused’s car and Mr Lim’s car, reviewing carpark CCTV footage and investigating Mr Lim’s credit card records and phone call records for the entire two week period between 3 to 24 February 2020 to ascertain the accused’s omissions” [^32]_. It had also been necessary to separately interview Mr Lim to ascertain their activities and discern what Mdm Oh had failed to reveal. it is clear from the foregoing that the accused’s persistent omissions put a needless strain on MOH’s resources. It bears emphasis that she did not voluntarily admit to the offences at the outset and **_only_** did so after she was confronted with the overwhelming evidence. Given this, I would be in full agreement of the characterisation by the learned DPP that Mdm Oh cared little of the wanton expenditure of investigative resources arising from her deliberate obstructive conduct when she states[^33]:

> 16    One of the most egregious features of this case is that the accused’s offences was not one-off but disclosed a high level of persistence. **_She repeatedly refused to disclose her outings with Mr Lim even though she had ample opportunity to come clean…_**

> 17     **_The fact that her omissions, were repeated and not one-off, underscores a clear deliberate intention to obscure this information from the authorities and undermine their authority and efforts in controlling COVID-19._** Her obstructive conduct and repeated omissions further betray a complete lack of remorse with regard to the offences. This is a serious aggravating factor that places the accused’s culpability at the higher end of the spectrum.

>     \[Emphasis added\]

### Time is of the essence for COVID-19 tracing and hence sentences must be adjusted to egregious non-cooperation leading to delay

48     The materiality of the information that Mdm Oh kept to herself could not be in doubt. The most essential aspect of such information would be their **_actual_** whereabouts and the individual or individuals that she had been in close contact with. As Mdm Oh had contracted COVID-19, it was imperative that her movements and the identity of individuals that she had been in close proximity with and spent significant time with be determined as quickly as possible. Delays would inevitably increase the risk of spread, with each further instance of delay exacerbating the risk on an **_exponential_** level, given the nature of viral progression from **_one_** spreader to **_multiple_** victims, and concomitantly from each for of these victims to singularly to then **_propagate_** the cycle by spreading to their own set of multiple victims. It is a sufficiently notorious fact, from regional and worldwide COVID-19 reportage, that a city can be brought to its knees from the ripple effect of the irresponsibly heedless acts of one individual triggering a super-spreader event. It was thus profoundly aggravating that Mdm Oh held out for a full 11 days and refused to yield despite the coaxing of four officer, only conceding in the face of **_inarguable_** documentary evidence.

### Potential harm from prolonged holding-out is immense

49     The other aspect connected to the materiality of the information would be that these encompassed no fewer than **_five_** occasions at different times and locations when she was likely to have been infectious. The serious consequences which might have ensued as a result of her breaches included the fact that these had occurred in the nascent days of the outbreak, prior to the institution of the circuit-breaker where the community would have been unmasked, and more advanced measures had not yet been implemented. The potential harm in Mdm Oh’s offending would be in to utterly stymie any ability to contact trace by MOH upon the onset of any infection that could have occurred in the course of her activities, as the authorities would have no idea that she and her associate would have even been in the vicinity. The situation would have become even murkier for contact tracers if the initial close contacts had spread to their **_respective_** close contacts within the 11 days she had held out. This would create an ever-larger pool of apparently unlinked cases, until the situation became inextricable, and the battle irretrievably lost to the virus, as has been seen in some distressing instances around the world.

### Culpability considerations: the accused was fully aware of the dangers of COVID-19

50     The prosecution had characterised Mdm Oh’s offending to be involving ‘**_very high culpability’_**. I do not disagree, considering had been formally diagnosed and was being treated for COVID-19 at the time she had misrepresented to Ms Lim. Counsel has emphasized that the offending has occurred in the early days of the contagion and Mdm Oh might not have known better, given the more limited information available at the time. I would respectfully disagree. Mdm Oh was certainly not an asymptomatic patient, nor did not contract a mild infection. These situations might have been better _grist_ for the mill that she had a poor impression of the severity of the disease. Instead, she had contracted the full-blown disease which had required her admission to Singapore General Hospital on 24 February 2020. She had despite experiencing the trauma of hospitalization and claimed fear for her grandson’s welfare (her grandson had been ill since 21 February 2021), chosen to exclude her outings with Mr Lim when interviewed by Dr Yang and then Ms Jayne Lim on 27 February 2020.

51     Ms Mabel Low had only stepped in when on 2 March 2020 when it became evident that she had been in Joy Garden Restaurant at SAFRA Jurong, which Mdm Oh had also failed to reveal to Dr Yang and Ms Jayne Lim (even after knowing that the other participants in the event had become infected in what was to be Singapore’s then most notorious cluster). Thus, by the time of her formal diagnosis of COVID-19 on 27 February 2020, Mdm Oh would have no illusions that COVID-19 from media and personal experience of the transmissibility and severity of complications from the disease but had chosen to obfuscate. On the former, the facts show Mdm Oh to be an outgoing, socially active, and cognitively competent individual, who could be expected to keep abreast of the news and media reportage of the pandemic. On the latter, defence counsel’s submissions describe his client as not merely being aware but actually being driven to profound anxiety by her affliction, stating[^34]:

>      **_To a person whose thought were verging on matters of life and death_**, concealing of facts would not have been foremost on Mdm Oh’s mind. To this end, we would reiterate that Mdm Oh had at all material times been suffering from high fever, bouts of cold, high blood pressure, breaking down in tears, **_and even anxiety at the material times_**. Any omission to furnish particulars, even if deliberate, must be viewed in light of her state of mind at the material times.

### The accused’s reasons for her dangerous omissions were comparatively trivial

52     I now turn to a connected point. As established above, Mdm Oh entertained no illusions of COVID-19’s dangers, it was thus especially aggravating that her eventual reason was expressed to from a desire to keep her meetings with Mr Lim private, as she did not want her family or Mr Lim’s family to find out that they were going out so frequently. This was premised on her concern _“that their family and friends would suspect that they were in a romantic relationship and spread rumours about them being in an extra-marital affair_”. The learned DPP had described Mdm Oh’s motive to be “**_selfish and frivolous”_** adding that it was “_entirely self-serving and frivolous_ (to omit) _such pertinent information from the SGH doctor, MOH officers and the investigation officer because she did not want to invite gossip about her and Mr Lim being in a romantic relationship or extra-marital affair_.”[^35]

53     There could be no basis to disagree with the learned DPP’s characterisation. Mdm Oh had only risked what would, at most, be a moderate degree of embarrassment in relation to her frequent associations with Mr Lim, which might at worst, set tongue wagging. It was not a situation where she was attempting to suppress the disclosure of an **_actual_** extramarital affair, or other situation which could threaten her marriage, or potentially cause grave reputational injury. Mdm Oh’s subordination of her legal (and indeed moral) obligations to co-operate in measures calculated to abate a **_public_** health crisis over a rather trivial **_personal_** interests in avoiding mildly salacious gossip is plainly unacceptable in the face of this unprecedented pandemic which is, unfortunately, still extant at the time of the writing of these grounds.

### Whether the present term is sufficient to effectively deter from all manner of breaches of this nature

54     Indeed, Mdm Oh’s offending over such a trivial reputational concern does beg the question whether the present maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment would suffice as an adequate deterrent for all manner of breaches of this nature, where scrupulous accuracy, honesty, and candour in reporting by involved persons could potentially be extremely **_consequential_** in controlling the pandemic.

55     There could well be situations in other cases where the stakes could be higher, such as where the suppression of knowledge of the illicit meeting are not in relation to banal or frivolous considerations but in circumstances that might reveal an **_actual_** affair or other dealings which could be enormously damaging to the marriage or personal and business relationships of the person responding to the contact tracing queries. The question arising would then be whether the sanction of six-months’ imprisonment would be **_enough_** of a deterrent to procure co-operation, or whether there might be instances where individuals might apprehend that the **_cost-benefit_** analysis against the present six-month maximum term would weigh in favour of keeping a particularly damaging association secret from contact tracers. This observation is, of course tangential to the present case. The point remains, however, that the aggravating circumstances of Mdm Oh endangering the public by her obstinate, deliberate, and drawn-out conduct for such dubious reasons must be properly addressed in sentencing.

### Offender-specific factors

56     While counsel has put forth a detailed mitigation plea, the two aspects which would have had any traction would be Mdm Oh’s clean record and the fact that she had eventually gravitated towards a plea of guilt. The latter was however diminished by the fact that if she had claimed trial, she would have had to explain away the vast body of documentary evidence amassed from a thorough review of carpark gantry records for the accused’s car and Mr Lim’s car, carpark CCTV footage, Mr Lim’s credit card records and all his call records between 3 and 24 February 2020. Counsel has also claimed Mdm Oh’s co-operation with IO Sanjeev when she “_volunteered information on her meet ups with (Mr Lim) on her own volition…while Mdm Oh was still recovering from COVID-19 in the hospital_”[^36], apparently with a view to characterise this as a demonstration of remorse.

57     When confronted with overwhelming evidence, as Mdm Oh was on 9 March 2020 by IO Sanjeev, an accused person’s concession to (finally) co-operate or plead guilty must necessarily have limited value. In _Wong Kai Chuen Phillip_ v _Public Prosecutor_ \[1990\] 2 SLR (R) 61; <span class="citation">\[1990\] SGHC 79</span> (“_Phillip Wong_”), Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was), had warned against according undue weight in mitigation pleas to instances where ostensible co-operation with authorities was cited as evidence of remorse, but where the accused, in reality, had no other feasible option. The offender in _Phillip Wong_ was a solicitor who had criminally misappropriated some $1.84 million from the client’s account of his firm. At \[13\], Chan J observed:

> 13    Although the appellant surrendered himself to the CAD, it is significant to note that this event occurred at a time when **_he really had no other choice._** He had no choice because the Council of the Law Society had taken over the clients’ account of his firm and it was only a question of time before his misdeeds came to light… {Emphasis added\]

### Analysis using the suggested harm and culpability framewotk

58     Analysing from an intersection of culpability and harm factors[^37], the following would be cogent in sentencing:

> (a)      _The offender’s reason for lying or otherwise misrepresenting her activities._

>> Given Mdm Oh’s reason for lying was premised on her desire to avoid gossip within the Oh and Lim families, and their negative associations from her frequent associations with Mr Lim, she was thus prepared to let a relatively trivial private concern trump the need to protect the public from the proliferation of COVID-19, a deadly pandemic.

> (b)      _Whether and when the offender knew she had contracted COVID-19._

>> Mdm Oh had been hospitalised for COVID-19 at the time of her non-disclosure of visits and activities to the four MOH officers.

> (c)      _The nature and extent of non-cooperation or deception of contact tracers_

>> While Mdm Oh did not completely “_stonewall_” investigators, she was grudging with her disclosures and notably non-cooperative.

> (d)      _Whether Mdm Oh had persisted in a pattern of evasive conduct of continued misrepresentation to different contact tracing officers_

>> Mdm Oh stymied contact tracing efforts by selectively “drip-feeding” investigators with incomplete information causing them to be unaware that she had been in the Jurong SAFRA cluster, which required their verification from other sources. She had thereafter continued to mask her association with Mr Lim until confronted with overwhelming evidence 11 days after her initial interview.

> (e)      _Whether Mdm Oh had taken precautions to minimise the risk of infection to others by curtailing her undisclosed activities._

>> Mdm Oh had consulted a doctor on 17 February 2020 but had persisted to meet Mr Lim on 18 February 2020 and 20 February 2020. Their meetings had generally involved shared meals in malls during lunch and dinner hours, where crowds would have been expected. There were no further meetings after her diagnosis, with Mdm Oh having been placed in sequestered hospitalisation.

> (f)      _Whether Mdm Oh had any personal experience or knowledge that would have given her additional knowledge or insight of the virulence and extent of morbidity of the disease concerned_

>> Mdm Oh was fully socialised person, who evidently interacted with her extended family, which included her grandson, a student at Raffles Institution. Her social interactions included attending _karaoke_ sessions, including the event which begat the Jurong SAFRA cluster. Given that she was certainly not socially isolated or reclusive by nature, she would have been aware of the evolving COVID-19 crisis and could not have been unaware the public health implications (within the state of knowledge of the infectivity and virulence of the pathogen in late February- early March 2020) of her concealment of information. She had described her own personal suffering, with her mitigation plea assiduously documenting the impact of her bout of COVID-19 on her psyche and bodily health. She had been especially stricken with anxiety and guilt that her grandson, whom she believed to have contracted the virus from her, might suffer permanent disabilities, such as brain damage. It is a noteworthy point in sentencing that she did not seem to demonstrate any concern that her actions in repeatedly obfuscating contact tracing efforts risked visiting similar suffering or trauma on the unsuspecting public.

### Final summing up for sentencing on proceeded charge

59     In addition to the above factors, I also considered the legislative scheme for offences under this section[^38], and noted the that the penalty for first time offenders had been enhanced to its present iteration in the background of the SARs epidemic, where the maximum imprisonment term of six months had been set for a far milder pandemic, whose reach was far less. COVID-19 is exponentially worse by SAR in its death toll (which had reached ten times that of SARs in China alone at the time Mdm Oh offended) but had the potential to cause devastation to entire industries (tourism, ‘_bricks-and-motar_’ retail and air-travel) and widespread unemployment. Hence a sentence at the farther end of the sentencing spectrum would be warranted.

60     I also considered that _Chew Suang Heng_,[^39] had received a three-month sentence for evading a quarantine order for a period of 32 hours and did not actually contract COVID-19. Mdm Oh had held back critical information for a full 11 days, drip-feeding information of other instances of travel, and only conceded after being confronted with indisputable evidence. I was of the view, upon taking stock of all the considerably more aggravated circumstances of Mdm Oh’s offending in respect of the **_proceeded_** charge, that a sentence of at least **_four months’ imprisonment_** would be appropriate.

## AN UPLIFT IS JUSTIFIED UPON CONSIDERING THE TIC CHARGE INVOLVING HER INSTIGATION OF A CO-OFFENDER

61     From the Statement of Facts, Mdm Oh’s actions to prevent the uncovering of her activities, included inducing another individual; Mr Lim, to suppress information during police investigations. I should make it clear that as Mdm Oh’s instigation of Mr Lim to remain silent about their **_liaisons concerned a TIC charge_**, this act was not “weighted” on the above analysis of culpability and harm factors in deriving the four-month sentence for the single **_proceeded_** charge, and there thus ought be no issue of double counting. The circumstances of Mdm Oh’s instigation, as well as its potential harm in obtaining Mr Lim’s co-operation to **_sanitise_** all traces of their association, would have her offending to an entire new level, as an offending ought to elevate the culpability of the offender as the circumstances of the TIC offence “_evinced a pattern of criminality that engaged the need for specific deterrence_”[^40].

### The principle in Public Prosecutor v S Elamparithi

62     The aforementioned principle was fully elucidated in the heretofore unreported case of _Public Prosecutor v S Elamparithi_ (MA 9238 of 2019, “_Elamparithi_”) In the instant case, I was also conscious of the need to build-in a **_general_** deterrent to effectively dissuade offenders from compounding their crimes by instigating others to mislead investigators by obtaining co-offenders’ co-operation in corroborating fictitious accounts.

63     In relation to the proceeded charge[^41] in _Elamparithi_, the accused and his wife encountered the victim; a certain Karrupiah s/o Kanjendran, who was driving a lorry against the flow of traffic along Chander Road on 13 February 2017[^42], Chander Road being a one-way street. Mr Elamparithi had engaged in a verbal exchange with the victim while both were in their vehicles before they proceeded to park their respective vehicles. The accused had later used his mobile phone to take some photos of the victim’s lorry which was parked at a nearby bin centre, intending to lodge a report on the victim’s driving. When the victim saw Mr Elamparithi, he had confronted the accused and a verbal dispute had ensued. The victim then pushed the appellant with sufficient force to cause him to stumble and drop the items he was carrying. The accused had retaliated by slapping the victim’s face three times.[^43]

64     Along with this charge, Mr Elamparithi unfortunately faced yet another charge, which had had agreed to have taken into consideration (TIC) for the purpose of sentencing. This[^44] was in relation to a separate incident of voluntarily causing hurt to another individual on 9 October 2016, where the accused had punched a certain Loganathan s/o Vadiveloo twice, with the blows landing on the left cheek and jaw respectively, causing generalised facial contusions and swelling.

65     In sentencing, See Kee Oon J had expressed his view that while the accused might have deserved **_a non-custodial_** sentence were he singly charged for the offence in the proceeded charge, the additional factoring of the TIC charge would have caused a shift of the sentencing spectrum over a threshold where he should properly be awarded a **_custodial_** sentence. Given the importance this point, I have reproduced the salient parts of See J’s exposition, where his Honour had set out a sequential framework for the proper evaluation of TIC charges:

> 13    I turn next to consider the implications of the TIC charge. It would appear that the TIC charge may have tipped the scales more heavily towards the sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution below. I accept that there was a need for specific deterrence given the similarity in conduct on the face of the charges.

> 14     **_I have in mind a two-step approach in assessing the appropriate final sentence. At the first step, I address what the appropriate sentence might be had the appellant faced only the proceeded charge._** Looking at that charge which involved the three slaps and bearing in mind the provocation by the victim, the low degree of harm and low culpability and the lack of any other obviously compelling aggravating factors balanced against the appellant’s personal mitigating factors, a high fine could have sufficed in my view. I do not think imprisonment was justifiable, having regard to the _Low Song Chye_ sentencing framework.

> 15     **_At the next step, I consider how the TIC charge elevates the culpability of the appellant and then decide how this impacts his eventual sentence. The appellant had committed a recent similar offence in the TIC charge involving violence. There was thus a worrying pattern of criminality and it was apparently a more serious offence given that his punches had caused more obvious injuries._** I am unable to infer more beyond this as I can only rely on what appears on the face of the charge. **_Prima facie, this elevates his culpability and engages the need for specific deterrence sufficiently to a point where the custodial threshold is rightly crossed_**.

> 16    The lack of details in a TIC charge does not ipso facto prevent a court from taking it into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (see PP v UI at \[39\]).

>     \[Emphasis added\]

66     As can be seen from the extracted fragment of the oral judgment, See Kee Oon J had emphasized the need for a sentencing court to consciously apply its mind to the interplay between proceeded and TIC charges. This was done with a view to deriving a holistic view of the accused’s overall culpability, with a view to meting a truly condign punishment, adding that “_sentencing is not a scientific exercise demanding mathematical precision; it is a matter of judicial discretion to be approached with a judicious measure of pragmatism and common sense, having regard to the offender-specific and offence-specific factors_.”[^45]

67     In _Elamparithi_, it was notable that the proceeded charge was one of voluntarily causing hurt where the accused has inflicted three slaps to an individual who had offered a degree of provocation. While the proceeded charge itself, on a “_stand-alone_” basis, would have entailed the imposition of a non-custodial sentence, the presence of a TIC charge, also under section 323 of the Penal Code, where the accused had punched another person on a different date, changed the complexion of the case to show a “_worrying pattern of criminality_” which “_elevates_ (the offender’s) _culpability and engages the need for specific deterrence where the custodial threshold is crossed_”. Ultimately, Mr Elamparithi had, based on this elevated culpability, been sentenced to a ten-day term of imprisonment, which was a downward titration of the district court’s original sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment.

### Deliberating on the appropriate uplift

68     In applying the test propounded in _Elampariti_, I have, at \[60\] already indicated that Mdm Oh’s misconduct would have merited at least a four-month term of imprisonment. On the second part of the analysis, on whether the TIC charge elevated the culpability of the accused, I would have assessed this to certainly be the case. While the other TIC charge involving Ms Mabel Low would have been ‘_more of the same’ vis a vis_ the proceeded charge in its similar nature of non-cooperation with a health official, the charge involving Mdm Oh’s instigation to Mr Lim Kiang Hong to eschew disclosure of their meetings if Ministry of Health officials inquired, was one that needed to be addressed separately in sentencing. The charge had demonstrated Mdm Oh’s resolute determination to completely suppress all evidence of their contact. As mentioned, Mdm Oh’s actions to prevent the uncovering of her activities by inducing another individual; Mr Lim, to suppress information during MOH investigations was a dangerous escalation of Mdm Oh’s criminal conduct, which was quite distinct from the fact of her own offending, where her persistent and deliberate non-cooperation has already been extensively detailed. The lengths she would go to just to insulate herself from mere “_gossip_” regarding their secretive association which she was concerned would resemble a romantic affair showed a “_pattern of criminality_” which had to be properly addressed, in the interests of **_both specific_** and **_general_** deterrence.

69     In this particular instance, there was considerable potential harm, given that Mr Lim **_did_** contract COVID-19, and the danger of allowing the two to collusively cover their tracks would have made it all but impossible for contact tracers to properly isolate persons who had come into contact with them. The failure, or indeed even just a delay, in detecting any such cases would have posed a risk of infection, and spiralling rounds of contagion from successive rounds of infected persons, the longer their activities and whereabouts remained undetected.

70     In establishing the additional tariff, I was mindful of the sentence must serve as an effective deterrent to dissuade individuals from the perpetration of such acts of collusion, where such tactics could fatally undermine any detection network set up to protect a population in a pandemic. It bears repeating that the **_virus_** cannot be negotiated with, and that only **_people_** can be persuaded to find their better selves in subsuming their individual desires and interest to the joint effort to combat the virus. The only effective _prophylaxis_, along with measures such as vaccination, quarantine, and social distancing, would be for each and every individual to understand his or her obligation to co-operate, and give timely, complete and scrupulously honest accounts in contact tracing, when called upon by health officials to do so. Concomitantly, appropriate sanctions ought be imposed for individuals who have not just egregiously failed to do so, but gone on to induce others to follow their campaign to suppress information critical to control the proliferation of a deadly virus. After careful deliberation, I was of the view that an uplift of **_one month’s imprisonment_** would serve as an effective deterrent.

71     Accordingly. Mdm Oh Kim Hiok was sentenced to a term of **_five months’ imprisonment_** for the charge proceeded with under section 64 of the Infectious Diseases Act.

### Present status of accused person
