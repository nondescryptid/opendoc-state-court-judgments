Credit And Security – Money and moneylenders – Loans of money

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DC 2/2022.\]

5 April 2022

### District Judge Jonathan Toh Jun Hian:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff pleaded that he gave two loans to the 1st defendant: $195,000 in January 2015, and a further $28,000 in April 2016. He sued the 1st defendant for not repaying the loans and the 1st defendant’s wife, the 2nd defendant, for having agreed to bear the 1st defendant’s debt.

2       After hearing the evidence, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim against the 1st defendant as he failed to prove his pleaded case. I also dismissed the plaintiff’s claim against the 2nd defendant because (a) he failed to prove that the 2nd defendant had agreed to bear the 1st Defendant’s debt; and (b) there was no written document signed by the 2nd defendant showing such agreement as required by Civil Law Act 1909 (2020 Rev Ed), s 6(b).

3       The plaintiff obtained leave to and filed an appeal in respect of the dismissal of his claim against the 1st defendant, and I set out the full grounds of my decision.

## Background

4       The plaintiff and the 1st defendant were friends in the same limousine services industry. According to the plaintiff, he got to know the 1st defendant in 2012 after the plaintiff started as a part-time limousine driver.[^1] The 1st defendant was then operating a sole proprietorship known as “Copthorne Limousine Services”.[^2]

5       In 2014 and 2015, the 1st defendant took loans from the plaintiff and made some repayments. The detailed terms of these loans and the repayments made are disputed. The plaintiff claimed that he gave two loans in the sums of $195,000 and $28,000, and the defendant made repayments totalling only $23,220, leaving the balance sum of $199,780 remained outstanding.[^3] The 1st defendant claimed that he only borrowed the sums of $6,000 and $30,000, and both sums were fully repaid with interest.[^4]

6       On or around 5 September 2016, the 1st defendant suffered a stroke and was hospitalised. The plaintiff then corresponded with the 2nd defendant about the loans. He claimed that the 2nd defendant promised to repay the loans by 15 September 2016 in consideration of him not issuing a Writ of Summons for the non-payment of the loans. The 2nd defendant denied making such a promise.

7       As the plaintiff did not receive any further payment from either defendant, he commenced suit.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s pleaded case

8       The plaintiff’s pleaded case against the 1st defendant is straightforward. At the 1st defendant’s request, the plaintiff advanced a first loan of $195,000 in January 2015, and a second loan of $28,000 in April 2016. Both loans remain unpaid and the total sum of $223,000 was due and owing.[^5]

9       As against the 2nd defendant, the plaintiff claimed that she promised to pay the outstanding sum owed by the 1st defendant by 15 September 2016 in consideration of the plaintiff forbearing to issue a writ of summons against the 1st defendant. If she did not do so, she would be jointly and severally liable with the 1st defendant to repay the outstanding sums.[^6]

### The defendants’ pleaded cases

10     The 1st defendant denied the two loans as pleaded by the plaintiff.[^7] Instead, he pleaded an entirely different transaction between the parties:

> (a)     He took a loan of $30,000 from the plaintiff at an unspecified interest rate, which was disbursed in various amounts over a period of time.[^8]

> (b)     He repaid the principal sum of $30,000 and interest of about $50,000 to $60,000 by various repayments made between June 2015 to March/April 2016.[^9]

> (c)     No statements were rendered to the 1st defendant to inform him of the interest rate or the repayments.[^10]

> (d)     In March or April 2016, the plaintiff compelled the 1st defendant to sign two documents with blank spaces where the loan sum would have been stated, on the basis that this was to acknowledge the loan given by the plaintiff to the 1st defendant.[^11]

11     The 1st defendant denied that he was liable to repay this $30,000 loan because it was unenforceable for contravening the Moneylenders Act 2008 (2020 Rev Ed),[^12] or alternatively, that it was already repaid.[^13] As a further alternative, the 1st defendant pleaded that the court should determine the reasonable interest rate payable on the loan and what remained due and payable.[^14]

12     The 2nd defendant simply pleaded that she had no knowledge of the alleged loans given to the 1st defendant and denied assuming liability for those loans.[^15] She also argued that there was no agreement made in writing and signed by her as required by Civil Law Act 1909, s 6(b).

## The issues

13     The issues to be decided were as follows:

> (a)     Did the plaintiff give the first loan of $195,000 and the second loan $28,000 to the 1st defendant, and if so, what sums remain due?

> (b)     Did the 2nd defendant agree to assume responsibility for the 1st defendant’s loans to the plaintiff and was the agreement made in writing and signed by her?

## Did the plaintiff give the first loan of $195,000 and the second loan of $28,000 to the 1st defendant?

14     On the first issue, I decided against the plaintiff because he abandoned his pleaded claim in cross-examination and told a significantly different story.

### The plaintiff’s AEIC evidence

15     The plaintiff was the sole witness that gave evidence on his behalf. His evidence as stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) filed on 28 August 2019 was that:

> (a)     The 1st defendant approached the plaintiff on or about January 2015 for a loan, and the plaintiff advanced “about $195,000” to the 1st defendant;[^16]

> (b)     In April 2016, the plaintiff extended a further sum of $28,000 to the 1st defendant.[^17]

> (c)     The 1st defendant deposited sums of money to the plaintiff’s account from January 2015 to August 2015 amounting to $23,220.[^18]

> (d)     The plaintiff’s claim was for the balance outstanding loan of $223,000 - $23,220 = $199,780.[^19]

16     To prove the pleaded loans, the plaintiff exhibited two single-page documents that appear to be signed by the 1st defendant.[^20] He did not explain how they were made. Both documents are similar in form. They are partly handwritten and partly typed. The first document is dated “January 2015/2016” and states that the plaintiff had given the 1st defendant $195,000 in cash (the “$195,000 Loan Document”). The second document is dated April 2016 and states that the plaintiff had given the 1st defendant $28,000 in cash (the “$28,000 Loan Document”). Both documents refer to full payment being due by the end of February 2017. They were signed off under “Copthorne Management and Consulting Service”, which was substantially similar to the name of the 1st defendant’s sole proprietorship “Copthorne Management & Consultancy Services”.[^21] The originals were produced in court.

17     However, in cross-examination, the plaintiff departed from his case and told a significantly different story.

### The plaintiff’s evidence in cross-examination

18     I begin with the first loan of $195,000.

19     The plaintiff’s evidence under cross-examination was that he was nothing more than the middleman between an unidentified moneylender and the 1st defendant.[^22] He did not advance the sum of $195,000 to the 1st defendant in January 2015. Rather, he had advanced various sums to the 1st defendant between January 2015 to January 2016.[^23] The largest of these sums was $30,000, but there were other sums that were advanced.[^24] These were loans that plaintiff had borrowed from the moneylender and given to the 1st defendant on a back-to-back basis.[^25] The total sums given to the 1st defendant was not told to the court.

20     These various loans carried interest, but the plaintiff did not know what the rate was. He only knew the amounts dictated to him by the moneylender that were due from the 1st defendant.[^26] The 1st defendant made small and sporadic repayments in the sums of around $600 to $800 a month.[^27] His payments did not cover the required interest and so the size of the debt grew.[^28] By January 2016, the outstanding sum had grown to a total of $195,000.[^29]

21     Although he was the middleman, the plaintiff said that he had no commission or benefit from the transactions.[^30] However, as the loans were taken by the plaintiff from the moneylender, and then on-lent to the 1st defendant, the plaintiff was personally liable to the moneylender.[^31] After the debt had grown to $195,000, he took it upon himself to pay the sum back to the moneylender and did so in three monthly instalments.[^32] He completed the repayment by August 2016.[^33]

22     As for the second purported loan of $28,000, the plaintiff explained that this sum represented interest that had accrued on the first loan.[^34] As the 1st defendant did not pay the interest, the plaintiff borrowed a further $28,000 from yet another moneylender to pay off the outstanding interest because the plaintiff was personally liable for it.[^35] As a result, he considered this to be a further loan that he advanced to the 1st defendant. This second loan of $28,000 carried an interest element of $8,000 a month for one year.[^36] This was interest that the new moneylender charged, and therefore had to be paid by the 1st defendant to the plaintiff who would then pay it to the new moneylender.[^37] This amounted to interest of $96,000 on a principal loan of $28,000. On 6 September 2016, the plaintiff asked the defendant for payment of interest that had accrued for 5 months, totalling $40,000.[^38]

### My decision

23     I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim as I found that he had abandoned his pleaded claim. By choosing not to plead his actual case, he also deprived the 1st defendant of the opportunity to raise defences relating to the Moneylenders Act 2008.

#### The plaintiff abandoned his pleaded claim

24     Given the plaintiff’s evidence in cross-examination, he had abandoned his pleaded claim.

25     First, in relation to the plaintiff’s pleaded claim that he advanced the first loan of $195,000 to the 1st defendant in January 2015 at the 1st defendant’s request:[^39]

> (a)     His new case was that he did not advance a principal sum of $195,000. Rather, He was the middleman who was engaged in back-to-back loan transactions between (i) an unnamed moneylender; (ii) the plaintiff; and (iii) the 1st defendant. The moneylender advanced a series of loans to the plaintiff, which the plaintiff then lent onwards to the 1st defendant between January 2015 and January 2016. It is not known what principal sums were advanced, and how many tranches there were.

> (b)     Significantly, the claim for repayment was not for an interest-free principal sum of $195,000. Rather, the various loans carried interest at a rate that was unknown to the plaintiff. The moneylender dictated the interest to be paid to the plaintiff who then asked for it from the 1st defendant. By January 2016, the principal and interest had grown to a total sum of $195,000.

26     The second pleaded loan of $28,000 was also contradicted by the plaintiff’s new case set out during cross examination.

> (a)     The pleaded case was for the principal sum of $28,000 loaned in April 2016 at the 1st defendant’s request.[^40] The plaintiff claimed repayment of the principal sum with no indication that any interest was repayable.

> (b)     In contrast, the plaintiff’s evidence during cross-examination was that this sum of $28,000 was never given to the 1st defendant. Rather, this was interest that had accrued on the loans owing by the 1st defendant to the plaintiff. Since the plaintiff’s evidence was that the total outstanding sum owing by the 1st defendant as at January 2016 was $195,000,[^41] this additional sum could only be the interest that had accrued _after_ January 2016.

> (c)     Since the plaintiff was personally liable to the moneylender for this interest, he borrowed $28,000 from a different moneylender to repay the first moneylender. This new loan carried interest of $8,000 a month for one year.

> (d)     The plaintiff treated this as a further loan that he extended to the 1st defendant.

27     The plaintiff’s case on the second loan was internally inconsistent with his case on the first loan.

> (a)     If the plaintiff had given a loan of $195,000 to the 1st defendant which carried interest of $28,000, then the claim for $28,000 was simply for interest owed to the plaintiff. This was not a second loan given by the plaintiff to the 1st defendant.

> (b)     If the plaintiff saw the sum of $28,000 as a second loan to the 1st defendant because he had paid it to the moneylender _on the 1st defendant’s behalf_, this could only be the case if the initial loan was owed by the 1st defendant directly to the moneylender.

> (c)     The plaintiff appears to have simply taken a new loan of $28,000 from a different moneylender to pay off his own loan to the moneylender. His claim against the 1st defendant, if anything, was simply for interest of $28,000 on the initial loan.

> (d)     As such, the plaintiff’s new case clearly contradicts the pleaded case that he had extended a second loan of $28,000 to the 1st defendant.

28     In the circumstances, the plaintiff failed to prove his pleaded case and his claims ought to be dismissed on that basis.

#### The plaintiff’s new case shows that the contents of the Loan Documents are untrue

29     The plaintiff’s new case also made it clear that the contents of the two Loan Documents were untrue:

> (a)     The $195,000 Loan Document stated that the plaintiff had given the 1st defendant $195,000 in cash. This contradicted the plaintiff’s new case that he had given the 1st defendant various loans which carried interest, and which, after accounting for repayments by the 1st defendant, had grown to a sum of $195,000 by January 2016.

> (b)     The $28,000 Loan Document stated that the plaintiff had given the 1st defendant $28,000 in cash. Again, this contradicted the plaintiff’s explanation that he had to take a separate loan to pay the interest that he owed to the moneylender, and treated that as a second loan to the 1st defendant.

30     It was likely that these documents were not consistent with the plaintiff’s actual case simply because they were created by the plaintiff to conceal the true nature of the transactions between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. In particular, the $195,000 Loan Document hid the fact that the sum of $195,000 included accrued interest on the back-to-back loans between the moneylender, the plaintiff and the 1st defendant.

31     I kept in mind that this is not an admission of debt claim. The plaintiff did not plead that the 1st defendant had acknowledged his debt by signing the two Loan Documents. He has not pleaded the two Loan Documents at all. They were adduced as evidence to prove the pleaded case that the two loans were advanced.

32     In my view, what had happened was that the plaintiff had created the two Loan Documents which did not reflect his true case. He then pleaded his claim based on what the two Loan Documents reflected on their face, even though it was not his true case. I do not have to decide if this was something done simply out of expedience or whether the plaintiff had, for more sinister reasons, decided to conceal his true case. The fact remains that he has now abandoned his pleaded case.

33     There were also significant issues with both parties’ evidence on how the two Loan Documents came to be signed.

> (a)     The plaintiff gave no evidence in his AIEC on how the Loan Documents came to be signed. This was surprising as the 1st defendant’s Defence specifically put in issue whether he had acknowledged the two loans by signing the two documents with the details filled in. His case was that he signed documents with blank spaces.[^42]

> (b)     In cross-examination, the Plaintiff explained that the two documents were signed on separate occasions in April 2016.[^43] He had a template document which he printed out.[^44] He then blanked out the old details with correction fluid and wrote in the amended details in front of the 1st Defendant.[^45]

> (c)     However, this account was only developed in the cross-examination of the plaintiff. Even though the 1st defendant gave evidence after the plaintiff, the 1st defendant was not confronted with this account during his cross-examination and was not given an opportunity to agree or disagree with it.

> (d)     That being said, the 1st defendant’s evidence on the point was also unsatisfactory. In his pleaded case and his AEIC, he claimed that he signed blank template documents without the necessary details filled in. However, under cross-examination, he changed his evidence and claimed that he signed a completely blank piece of paper.[^46] When he was asked whether the signatures on the $195,000 Loan Document and the $28,000 Loan Document were his, he initially denied that they were.[^47] He also made a police report claiming that he did not sign the documents.[^48] However, he later changed his evidence and said that he could not confirm whether they were his signatures or not.[^49]

34     In any case, as the plaintiff had not pleaded an admission of debt claim and given the inconclusiveness of the parties’ evidence, I found that nothing turned on this evidence.

#### The plaintiff’s new case deprived the 1st defendant of the opportunity to raise defences relating to moneylending

35     There were two further matters which gave me concern.

36     First, it was unlikely that the unidentified moneylender that the plaintiff spoke of was a licensed moneylender who had disbursed a legitimate loan.

> (a)     When the plaintiff was asked to identify the moneylender, he insisted that he could not remember.[^50] At the same time, he claimed that the moneylender was “a licensed fellow but… a friend”.[^51] In my view, it was untrue that the plaintiff could not remember who this friend was. The plaintiff had borrowed various sums from this friend. He also allegedly repaid the entire sum of $195,000 at great personal cost. It was therefore very unlikely that the plaintiff could not remember who this friend was. He was simply refusing to name the moneylender.

> (b)     The loan was not disbursed to the plaintiff at a licensed moneylender’s business premises.[^52]

> (c)     No loan documents were produced by the plaintiff.[^53]

> (d)     The interest rate was not made known to the plaintiff.[^54]

> (e)     The plaintiff claimed to have repaid the loan to the moneylender in full, but no receipt was given to him because their relationship was one of “trust”.[^55]

37     These facts raise issues as to whether the loans between the moneylender, the plaintiff and the 1st defendant were in breach of the Moneylenders Act 2008 (2020 Rev Ed) and therefore unenforceable. For example:

> (a)     Was the moneylender carrying on the business of moneylending? If so, was he licensed?

> (b)     If the loan to the plaintiff was granted by an unlicensed moneylender and therefore unenforceable pursuant to Moneylenders Act 2008, s 19(3)(a), would a back-to-back loan consequently given by the plaintiff to the defendant be similarly unenforceable?

> (c)     Did the plaintiff apply for the loan in writing as required by Moneylenders Act 2008, s 30(1)?

> (d)     Did the moneylender inform the plaintiff of the terms of the loan as required by Moneylenders Act 2008, s 32(1), and provide the signed note of the contract as required under s 33(1)? If not, the moneylender would not be entitled to enforce such loans pursuant to ss 32(3) and 33(1).

> (e)     Were there statements of account, loan documents and receipts provided as required under Moneylenders Act 2008, s 34?

> (f)     What interest and charges did these loans bear, and did they exceed the prescribed permitted charges and maximum rate of interest pursuant to Moneylenders Act 2008, ss 35 and 36?

> (g)     Did the moneylender know that the loans disbursed to the plaintiff were meant to be on-lent to the 1st defendant on a back-to-back basis on the same terms?

38     As the plaintiff failed to plead his actual case, the 1st defendant was deprived of the opportunity of examining the circumstances and terms of the alleged loans, and potentially raising the defence that such loans were unenforceable for contravening the Moneylenders Act 2008. Without having the benefit of full arguments on the issue, I will only say that it is doubtful that an unlicensed moneylender could circumvent the requirements of the Moneylenders Act 2008 by having a third-party middleman like the plaintiff enter back-to-back transactions with the borrower.

39     Second, I was troubled by the evidence that suggested that the second loan of $28,000 carried interest of $8,000 per month for one year. Interest of $96,000 on a principal sum of $28,000 results in an effective interest rate of 342% per annum. Such interest appears to me to be excessive and unconscionable. In any case, it would be in breach of the maximum rate of interest of 4% per month prescribed by the Moneylenders Rules 2009, Rule 11(1). From this, I became concerned about the undeclared interest for the various loans that the plaintiff had acted as a middleman, and whether such interest was similarly excessive. None of these questions could be explored because the plaintiff failed to plead his actual case.

### Conclusion

40     I note that given the plaintiff’s actual case expounded in cross-examination, there may well be debts that the 1st defendant owed to the plaintiff. After all, it is undisputed that the 1st defendant had made various repayments in 2015 and 2016 to the plaintiff. It is also the 1st defendant’s own case that he did take some loans from the plaintiff which 1st defendant then claimed to have fully repaid, although he did not adduce evidence of such repayment.

41     However, the plaintiff chose not to plead his actual case and explain the circumstances to the court. Instead, he chose to plead his case based on the $195,000 Loan Document and the $28,000 Loan Document which, according to his own evidence in cross-examination, did not reflect his true case. He then abandoned his pleaded case by stating a different case in cross-examination. This deprived the 1st defendant of the opportunity to plead and prove possible defences that may have been available to him.

42     In conclusion, on the question of whether the plaintiff gave the first loan of $195,000 and the second loan of $28,000 to the 1st defendant, I found that he did not. As such, his claim against the 1st defendant is dismissed.

## Did the 2nd defendant agree to assume responsibility for the 1st defendant’s loans to the plaintiff?

43     Although the plaintiff has not appealed against the dismissal of his claim against the 2nd defendant, for completeness, I set out the grounds of my decision on this issue.

44     The plaintiff pleaded that on 5 September 2016, the 2nd defendant promised to repay the loans to the plaintiff by 15 September 2016 in consideration of the plaintiff forbearing to sue the 1st defendant. She also allegedly agreed that if she failed to pay, she would become jointly and severally liable with the 1st defendant to repay the loans.[^56]

45     The evidence for this alleged agreement was sorely lacking.

> (a)     The plaintiff’s AEIC only contained a bare assertion that the 2nd defendant had assumed liability on 5 September 2016 for her husband’s loan repayment. No objective evidence was referred to.

> (b)     In re-examination, the plaintiff explained that after the 1st defendant suffered a stroke and was hospitalised, he had a telephone conversation with the 2nddefendant. He informed her of her husband’s debts to him, and said that if they were not settled, he had no choice but to activate debt collectors and other “legal things”. She responded to say “No, no. Don’t do it. Okay, just trust me. I will settle the thing. Just give me some times (_sic_).”[^57] After this call, he sent her details of the two loans by way of SMS, to which she replied “Noted. Thank you.”.[^58] The plaintiff took this message to mean that the 2nd defendant agreed to bear the 1st defendant’s debts.

46     In cross-examination, the 2nd defendant stated that she gave no assurances to the plaintiff. At the time, her husband was hospitalised after suffering a stroke and she was focused on him and her children.[^59] She did not know who the plaintiff was before he had contacted her. When he informed her of the alleged debts, she asked for the details, and that was why the plaintiff sent her the SMS stating the two loans.[^60] She then responded with the message “Noted. Thank you” merely to acknowledge that she had received the information which she would then discuss with her husband.[^61] She explained that if debt collectors were to come to her house, she would simply call the police.[^62]

47     I found that the 2nd defendant did not agree to bear the 1st defendant’s debts to the plaintiff.

> (a)     The plaintiff’s evidence that she had agreed to do so verbally over the phone was a bare assertion made by the plaintiff in re-examination that was absent from the plaintiff’s AEIC, and I found it unreliable.

> (b)     Her SMS reply stating “noted thank you” did not constitute her agreement to bear the 1st defendant’s debts. I accepted her explanation that she was merely acknowledging that she had received the plaintiff’s information, and that she would then have to check with her husband.

48     In any event, the claim against the 2nd defendant fell foul of Civil Law Act 1909, s 6(b), which states:

>     No action shall be brought against… any defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person;… unless the promise or agreement upon which such action is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some other person lawfully authorised by him.

49     The plaintiff did not produce any document recording such promise or agreement that was in writing and signed by the 2nd Defendant.[^63]

50     In conclusion, I found that the 2nd defendant did not agree to assume responsibility for the 1st defendant’s loans to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff’s claim against her is dismissed.

## Costs

51     The defendants asked for a single set of costs of $18,000 plus reasonable disbursements on the basis that this was similar to the high end of the costs scale for a Magistrate’s Court suit. The plaintiff submitted costs of $8,000 on the basis that there were no complex issues in this case, which essentially turned on the facts.

52     The trial of this action was initially fixed on 29 June 2021. The plaintiff was ill and issued with a stay home notice and the trial was vacated. The trial then took place on 6 August 2021 and the evidence taking completed within a single day.

53     As this was a one-day trial on a claim that essentially turned on limited issues of fact, I awarded costs of $12,500 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendants.
