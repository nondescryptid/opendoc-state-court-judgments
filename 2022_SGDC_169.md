Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases

1 August 2022

### Deputy Registrar Loh Hui-min:

## Introduction

1       This is an assessment of damages (“AD”) arising from a traffic accident which occurred on 4 February 2017. The Plaintiff, then aged 19 years old, sustained personal injuries in a collision between the motorcycle he was riding and the Defendant’s vehicle (“the Accident”).

2       Pursuant to a consent interlocutory judgment entered on 20 August 2020, the Defendant is to pay 85% of the damages assessed to be due to the Plaintiff.

## The disputed heads of claim

3       Parties have agreed to a sum of **$500** for transport expenses[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) and a sum of **$3,000** for future medical expenses[^2].

4       As for the Plaintiff’s medical expenses, he confirmed at the AD hearing on 15 December 2021 that his claim is only for medical expenses incurred _after_ his NS release on 12 April 2018.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) These are listed as items 14 to 29 of the List of Medical Expenses[^4] annexed to his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”). The total sum of these items is **$859.87**, and this is not disputed by the Defendant.

5       In the premises, only the heads of claim for (i) pain and suffering; and (ii) loss of earning capacity (“LEC”) remain for assessment. I consider these in turn.

## Damages for pain and suffering

6       Damages for non-pecuniary losses (like pain and suffering) do not lend themselves to straightforward mathematical calculation and are difficult to quantify. As the Court of Appeal observed in _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> (“_Lua Bee Kiang_”) (at \[9\]), the guiding principle is that of “fair compensation”, which means that compensation ought to be reasonable and just. It need not be “absolute” or “perfect”.

7       In assessing the quantum of damages to award for each injury, I obtain guidance from the indicative ranges of awards published in Charlene Chee _et al_, _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“the _Guidelines_”) as well as various precedent cases including those summarised in digest (_e.g._, in Carrie Chan _et al, Practitioner’s Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (Lexis Nexis, 3rd Ed, 2016) (“the _Blue Book_”)). I emphasise however, that whilst these give a sense of the possible award for each type of injury, each case must ultimately turn on its own particular facts (see _Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 178</span> (“_Ronnie Tan_”) at \[11\]).

8       Finally, given that the Guidelines were rendered and many of the cited precedent cases decided, several years ago, the awards are adjusted upwards to account for inflation where necessary (see _Ronnie Tan_ at \[18\]).

### Head / brain injury

#### Approach used to quantify damages

9       A preliminary issue arises as to whether it will be appropriate to adopt the “component approach” in assessing the quantum of damages to be awarded for the Plaintiff’s head/brain injury.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) The “component approach” was set out in _Tan Yu Min Winston v Uni-Fruitveg Pte Ltd_ \[2008\] 4 SLR(R) (at \[25\] – \[26\]) and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> (“_Samuel Chai_”) (at \[48\]). In gist, the injuries and impairments are classified into three domains which are then separately assessed:

> (a)     structural injury (_e.g._, brain oedema, subdural, extradural subarachnoid haematoma, brain contusion, loss of consciousness);

> (b)     psychological injury (_e.g._, depression, mood swings, anger, anxiety); and

> (c)     cognitive impairment (_e.g._, loss of spatial, visual, long- and short-term memory, intellect (in terms of IQ), learning ability).

10     In my judgment, it will be appropriate to adopt the “component approach” here. The advantages of such an approach were recognised by the Court of Appeal in _Samuel Chai_ (at \[48\]):

> … As we see it, such sub-itemisation was no more than an instrument to aid the court to determine what would be a fair and reasonable quantification for a particular injury or disability having regard to precedents. It enables the court to address the different aspects of pain, suffering and loss of amenities arising out of an injury systematically. …

The fact that the Plaintiff’s head/brain injury is allegedly ‘less serious’ than in other cases,[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) does not detract from the fact that there are separate and distinct aspects of the Plaintiff’s head/brain injury that will benefit from being separately assessed in a systematic manner.

11     Furthermore, the Defendant’s concern that sub-itemisation will lead to over-compensation[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) is misplaced. As the Court of Appeal in _Samuel Chai_ noted (at \[49\]), the component approach where properly applied will prevent over-compensation rather than encourage it. Nevertheless, I am mindful of the reminder in _Samuel Chai_ (at \[49\]) that “the overall quantum must be a reasonable sum reflective of the totality of the injury”. I therefore continue to have regard to precedents where the “global approach” was adopted, insofar as they provide a backdrop or check against which awards can be placed, to ensure that the _overall_ quantum of damages awarded is reasonable and reflective of the totality of the injury (see _Lee Wei Kong (by his litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 85</span> (at \[14\])).

#### Structural Injury

12     When first admitted, the Plaintiff was documented to have a Glasgow Coma Scale (“GCS”) score E3 V2 M5 (10 out of 15).[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) He was diagnosed with a left occipital condyle fracture which was treated conservatively.[^9] As for the bleeding in his brain, it was described as a “small foci of haemorrhage in the right frontal intracranial region” in one report[^10] and “small subarachnoid haemorrhages in bilateral frontal lobes” in another[^11]. This discrepancy notwithstanding, a CT scan performed on 13 February 2017 showed that the bleeding had resolved on its own.[^12] The Plaintiff underwent a brain MRI on 19 April 2017 which revealed findings suggestive of diffuse axonal injury.[^13] He was noted to have returned to a full GCS score by 19 May 2017.[^14] No further neurosurgical intervention or neurological treatment was required.[^15]

13     The main bone of contention here is whether the Plaintiff continues to suffer from a residual neurological abnormality in the form of a subtle weakness in his right arm and leg. This was the conclusion of the Plaintiff’s expert, Dr Ho King Hee[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) (“Dr Ho”), after his physical examination of the Plaintiff.[^17] The Defendant’s expert Dr Chong Piang Ngok[^18] (“Dr Chong”), who had also examined the Plaintiff, disagreed for the following reasons:[^19]

> (a)     Based on the CT and MRI scans, the Plaintiff suffered a more severe injury to the right side of the brain which should result in weakness to the _left_ side of the body, but Dr Ho did not find evidence of any left sided weakness.

> (b)     Dr Ho also did not find any weakness to the Plaintiff’s right facial muscle, which would be inconsistent with his suffering from a right sided weakness due to brain injury.

> (c)     Finally, Dr Sharon Low (“Dr Low”), one of the Plaintiff’s attending doctors, had stated in her report that the Plaintiff did not suffer from any focal neurological deficit as of 19 May 2017.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) As such traumatic injuries improve or (at worse) remain static over time, the Plaintiff’s condition ought not to have deteriorated. Dr Low did not testify as her attendance was dispensed with by parties and her report admitted into evidence as is.

14     When cross-examined, Dr Ho agreed that the Plaintiff suffered a more severe injury to the right side of the brain and that one will expect more neurological deficits on the opposite side of the body (_i.e._, on the left side).[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) However, he denied that the foregoing was inconsistent with his finding of subtle weakness in the Plaintiff’s right arm and leg:[^22]

> A:    I will regard this finding as unexpected but not inconsistent with the fact that the Pf had diffuse axonal injury, which means that there would have been damage to both sides of the brain.

> Because the damage is not necessarily symmetrical, it may be that on the left side of the brain, parts of the brain that are responsible or motor power on the right side of the body were affected to a greater extent than on the right side of the brain. While I have said that we would expect, generally speaking, more left sided signs and symptoms, in this particular case because of the documented bilateral brain injuries, weakness on the right side of the body is possible.

15     Having considered the medical evidence in its totality, I find that the detection of subtle right arm and leg weakness, may well boil down to a legitimate difference of medical opinion. Dr Chong testified that a score of 5- was “so subtle that neurologists may disagree with each other”.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) Dr Ho (who himself described the weakness as “subtle”) testified that the detection of this weakness would depend on the examiner, the technique he/she employed, and the clinical question posed to him/her.[^24] More pertinently however, it appears to me that even if the weakness existed, it was so insignificant that any damages for pain and suffering awarded for it would be nominal. Dr Ho himself recognized that _“\[the\] subtlety of the weakness may have been such that_ **_the patient himself might not be aware of it_**” \[emphasis added in **bold**\].[^25] He observed that the Plaintiff did not complain of any right arm weakness and whilst the Plaintiff did complain about his right leg, his complaint “was largely orthopedic”.[^26]

16     As regards the appropriate quantum of award for structural damage, the Plaintiff submits for an award of $25,000 for the skull fracture and $53,000 for the diffuse axonal injury.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) For the latter, the Plaintiff relies on _Muhamad Ilyas Mirza Abdul Hamid v Kwek Khim Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 12</span> (“_Muhamad Ilyas_”). In _Muhammad Ilyas_, the plaintiff suffered from a diffuse axonal brain injury (admitted into hospital with GCS score of 8) and right orbital wall fracture, right malar fracture, bilateral mandible fractures. As a result, he had post-accident amnesia, had to relearn basic skills (including speech), suffered from a deterioration of memory which impacted his learning, and depression. The court took a _global_ approach to in assessing damages and awarded a _global_ sum $80,000 for his head and brain injuries.

17     In the present case, the Plaintiff sought to ascertain and then subtract awards for the right orbital wall, right malar, and bilateral mandible fractures from the global award in _Muhamad Ilyas_ to arrive at the award for the diffuse axonal injury.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) In my judgment, this approach is plainly wrong. A _global_ award arrived at by using a _global_ approach, like that in _Muhamad Ilyas_, does not lend itself to the simple arithmetic calculation advanced by the Plaintiff. This approach ignores the overlaps or composite effects of those injuries which could have affected the court’s global assessment. Moreover, even if such arithmetic calculations are workable, there also needs to be deductions made for the post-accident amnesia and cognitive impairments suffered by the plaintiff in _Muhamad Ilyas_, since these are being separately claimed for by the Plaintiff in the present case.

18     Turning to the other precedents cited by parties, I find the decision in _Samuel Chai_ the most relevant. In _Samuel Chai_, the component approach had been adopted and a sum of $29,000 awarded for the structural damage component, which comprised a fracture to the base of the skull, severe cerebral contusion, diffuse axonal injury with subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage, right parietal scalp hematoma and a 3 cm indentation on the side of the head. She was admitted to the hospital with a GCS score of 3 and required emergency intubation and external ventilation for 8 days as well as invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure due to significant cerebral oedema. At this juncture, I note that the award in _Yeow Mong Inn v Imran bin Mohd Hassan_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 28 of 2000)[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) (“_Yeow Mong Inn_”), where the plaintiff was awarded $23,000 for a “skull fracture extending to the base of the skull” which was treated conservatively, appears to be on the high side comparatively. In the absence of any reasoning or further details of the injury in the case summary, I am inclined to treat _Yeow Mong Inn_ with some caution.

19     The structural damage suffered by the Plaintiff was less extensive and severe than that of the plaintiff in _Samuel Chai_. The Plaintiff was admitted with a higher GCS score of 10. His injuries were treated conservatively and largely resolved by themselves without the need to resort to the invasive procedures that the plaintiff in _Samuel Chai_ had been subjected to. It will thus be appropriate to make a downward adjustment to the award in _Samuel Chai_, even accounting for inflation. I therefore award **$18,600** for this component of structural damage.

#### Psychological injury

20     In the period immediately after the Accident, the Plaintiff suffered from episodes of agitation and restlessness which required medication to manage.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) However, these appear to have been resolved during his inpatient rehabilitation stay (from 28 February 2017 to 10 March 2017) and he was assessed to have no mood issues prior to his discharge on 10 March 2017.[^31] At a subsequent outpatient review on 19 May 2017, the Plaintiff also did not report any mood instability.[^32]

21     Dr Ho had opined that the Plaintiff suffered from severe mood disturbances based on psychometric screening conducted during his examination of the Plaintiff.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) However, he also testified during cross-examination that he will defer to the findings of psychiatric assessments carried out on the Plaintiff in 2019 and 2021.[^34] In this regard, the TTSH psychiatrist who assessed the Plaintiff on 19 November 2019 found that he had episodes of low mood but otherwise no mental illness and did not require medication.[^35] There was no mention that the episodes of low mood had impacted his normal daily functioning. Dr Lim Yun Chin (“Dr Lim”)[^36], who examined the Plaintiff on 9 January 2021, also did not record any mood disturbances or psychological issues in his report.[^37]

22     The Plaintiff’s submission of $10,000 for psychological injury appears excessive when compared to the damages awarded in the precedents he cited.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) In _Law Kin Ying (administratrix of the estate of Lo Hon Man) and others v Lim Hong Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCR 14</span>, the plaintiff was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) and depression which had impacted her ability to function normally and had to be treated with medication as well as supportive and cognitive behaviour therapy. Even six years after the accident, moderate symptoms of her PTSD and her depression remained clinically significant. By contrast, the Plaintiff’s restlessness and agitation had been resolved quickly and his episodes of low mood do not require long term medication or treatment. The Plaintiff’s injury was also less serious than that in _Tan Kok Leong Ivan v Pilot Pen (S) Pte Ltd_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 1127 of 2012)[^39], where the plaintiff suffered from panic attacks and palpitations, for which he underwent psychological therapy.

23     In the premises, I find that an award **$3,200** for this component of psychological injury is appropriate.

#### Cognitive impairment

24     According to Dr Tay, the Plaintiff suffered from post-traumatic amnesia of approximately three weeks.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40) A neuropsychological assessment carried out in July 2017 revealed impairments to his learning, memory, fluency, and executive functions.[^41] A subsequent neuropsychological assessment carried out in February 2020 showed that his fluency and executive functions had improved to his estimated pre-morbid ability. As for his memory, the Plaintiff’s visual, immediate, and delayed memory had improved to his estimated pre-morbid ability. However, his auditory memory was in the borderline range, worse than his estimated premorbid low average to average ability.[^42] Dr Tay explained that _“his memory profile was also characterised by the tendency to be overwhelmed when presented with chunks of verbal information.”_[^43] He also clarified that memory and learning are assessed together as memory is required for learning – the Plaintiff therefore also suffers from a learning impairment.[^44] He opined that further substantial improvement to the Plaintiff’s cognition is unlikely.[^45]

25     The Defendant submits that less weight should be placed on the neuropsychological assessments and the expert opinions stemming therefrom, as the neuropsychological assessment reports have not been admitted into the evidence and the neuropsychologist(s) were not called to give evidence.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) I think it pertinent to note that this is the **_first_** time that this issue is being raised in the AD, despite my repeated reminders to parties to confer on the medical issues in dispute. After the Plaintiff’s expert witnesses had taken the stand (including Dr Tay), I again suggested that parties carefully consider the medical reports to confirm that no further clarifications were required and/or other experts needed to testify.[^47] At the end of the AD, parties confirmed that no other medical witnesses needed to be called and that the reports could stand as they are.[^48] Furthermore, Dr Tay had confirmed during cross-examination that neuropsychological testing was within his area of expertise[^49] and it was not suggested to him, that he had somehow misrepresented or misinterpreted the results of the neuropsychological assessments. Put simply therefore, the Defendant’s submission appears to be a complete afterthought.

26     The Defendant further argues that because the evaluation of the Plaintiff’s auditory memory issue was pegged to his estimated pre-morbid abilities, the neuropsychological evaluation was conducted based on “an imprecise science or standard of measurement”.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) This was again not put to Dr Tay. In any case, I am unable to agree. Dr Tay had explained that a patient’s pre-morbid cognitive ability was an estimate based on an assessment of the patient’s educational background and academic scores because _“we do not have the benefit of hindsight to do a test before the accident.”_[^51] This method of estimating a patient’s pre-morbid cognitive ability with reference to his educational background and academic scores is reasonable in the circumstances and certainly did not render it unscientific or imprecise. Moreover, neither of the Defendant’s experts had challenged the methodology employed in these neuropsychological assessments.

27     In any event, the evidence of the Defendant’s own expert, Dr Lim, supports the findings in the neuropsychological assessments. Dr Lim _agreed_ that the Plaintiff’s memory and learning are impaired, although he opined that “this difficulty stood out only in terms of his academic study”.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) When asked to elaborate on his opinion, Dr Lim clarified that in his view, the Plaintiff’s impairment related to his inability to continue and cope with further studies as well as difficulties in assimilating or acquiring new information, for example those contained in instruction manuals that he encountered in his previous job as paramedic.[^53] Dr Lim testified that the Plaintiff’s cognitive impairment did not appear to have any adverse effect on his daily functioning such as “relationship, communication, ability to handle money, ability to calculate and ability to self-care”.[^54] Finally, Dr Lim opined that “some recovery of function can take place due to the brain ‘re-wiring’ itself” but also acknowledged that _“the fastest recovery occurs over the first six months following the injury following which the recovery can be unpredictable such that some may see no progress while other can report gradual improvement for many years afterwards”_.[^55]

28     Turning to Dr Chong’s evidence, he had described an incident during the interview, where the Plaintiff was able to read Dr Chong’s notes and correct the date of the Accident which had been erroneously recorded.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) Whilst Dr Chong opined that this showed how _“sharp”_ the Plaintiff was, he also clarified that this incident was **_not_** inconsistent with the Plaintiff having auditory memory issues.[^57] He was further at pains to emphasise that his remarks that the Plaintiff did not suffer from any deficits in mental function were made in the context of a clinical encounter, which meant (in his words), _“when I see a patient, there was no observation that he did not understand what I say and was unable to cooperate”_.[^58] He further testified _“if I were to stress his memory, for example give him a list of things and then ask him to recall what was just said, he might get into trouble”_. In this regard, Dr Chong candidly admitted that he was not an authority on neuropsychological assessment and would defer to the findings of the neuropsychological assessment.[^59] Dr Chong also agreed with Dr Ho that “\[a\] head injury of this nature would be expected to lead to some deficit in the mental function”.[^60] Dr Ho had opined that the Plaintiff’s complaint of memory issues “is consistent with a degree of post-traumatic brain injury” which the Plaintiff had suffered from.[^61]

29     In my judgment, the medical evidence shows that the Plaintiff continues to suffer from impairments to his auditory memory and learning, which are unlikely to improve further over the long term. However, it appears that the impact of these cognitive impairments has largely been confined to Plaintiff’s employment and he continues to be able to function independently in the community.

30     Turning to quantum, the Plaintiff’s submission for a $15,000 award for post-traumatic amnesia appears to be premised on a misapprehension of Dr Lim’s evidence.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62) Dr Lim accepted that the Plaintiff had post-traumatic amnesia (“he has a memory loss of that event”)[^63] but did not testify that the condition persisted at the time of the AD. In any case, the evidence of Dr Tay, who was the Plaintiff’s treating doctor during his inpatient rehabilitation and after his discharge, is preferred (see above at \[24\]). As such, there is no justification for a massive uplift from the awards in _Ong Zern Chern Philip v Wong Siang Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 256</span> and _K Punitan A/L Kovilan v S Ghanisen & 3 Ors_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 3984 of 2008)[^64].

31     As for the Plaintiff’s memory and learning impairment, the following precedents were referred to by parties:

> (a)     In _Roni bin Garong v Ho Kok Keong_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 1337 of 2012 and RAS 260 of 2014)[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) (“_Roni bin Garong_”), the sum of $18,000 was awarded for the plaintiff’s cognitive and memory impairments. Unfortunately, there is not much detail available as to the nature and extent of these cognitive and memory impairments save that the plaintiff “became forgetful” and “takes a long time to think”.

> (b)     In _Samuel Chai_, the plaintiff was awarded $10,000 for moderate impairment in information processing and mild impairments in verbal abstract reasoning, new learning, memory, and verbal fluency. In this regard the court had observed that her cognitive impairments did not appear to have a significant impact on her daily life.

> (c)      _Ting Heng Mee v Sin Sheng Fresh Fruits_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 43</span> (“_Ting Heng Mee_”), the plaintiff was awarded $25,000 for a severe impairment of his delayed spatial memory, significant impairment of his short and long-term visual memory, mild deterioration of his cognitive abilities as well as amnesia.

32     Having considered the above precedents, I am of the view that the Plaintiff’s cognitive impairments were most like those suffered by the plaintiff in _Samuel Chai_, although it appears that more aspects of cognitive function were impaired in _Samuel Chai_. However, the award for cognitive impairment in _Samuel Chai_ did not cover post-traumatic amnesia. Inflation also must be accounted for. I therefore assess damages for this component to be **$12,000**.

#### The total quantum

33     The total quantum of damages awarded for the plaintiff’s head and brain injuries would therefore be **$33,800**. By way of a check, I compared this overall quantum of damages to the precedent global awards referred to by the Plaintiff. I think it pertinent to note that these were cases where the head and brain injuries suffered were far more serious than that in the present case. For instance, the plaintiff in _Muhamad Ilyas_ suffered from multiple fractures of the skull and face (as compared to the single fracture suffered by the Plaintiff in the present case), more serious cognitive impairments (he had to relearn basic skills including speech and suffered from a deterioration of memory) and was diagnosed with depression. The award is also in line with the Guideline range for “minor brain damage” after adjustments for inflation and bearing in mind that the Guideline range does not appear to make provision for the skull fracture.

34     I am therefore satisfied that the total award of **$33,800** is reasonable and reflective of the totality of the Plaintiff’s head and brain injuries.

### Closed displaced fracture of the right femur and keloidal scars on lateral thigh, shin and lower leg

35     I deal first with the preliminary issue of the approach to be taken in assessing damages for these injuries.

36     The Plaintiff submits for separate awards as follows -- $25,000 for the fracture, $15,000 for the keloidal scars on his thigh, $5,000 for the keloidal scars on his shin and $5,000 keloidal scars on his lower leg.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66) He argues that it will be inequitable to make a single award due to the sheer number of scars and that the thigh, shin and lower leg were different locations.[^67] The Defendant submits that a single, global award of $16,000 should be made for all these injuries.[^68] In this regard, the Defendant has drawn my attention to the _Guidelines_ where the description for moderate injuries provides for “unsightly scars which cannot be removed completely by cosmetic surgery”.[^69]

37     In my judgment, a global approach will be appropriate to take here as the injuries are proximately close and there is a degree of overlap. In this regard, I note that the keloidal scars arose from the surgical procedures performed for the fracture. I should emphasise that adopting this approach does not mean that the Plaintiff’s multiple keloidal scars will be disregarded. Rather, the court seeks to ultimately arrive at an award which will be reflective of the _totality_ of the Plaintiff’s pain and suffering from the injuries.

38     The Plaintiff underwent an external fixation for the fracture on 4 February 2017.[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70) This was subsequently removed, and an intramedullary nailing of the right femur was performed on 9 February 2017.[^71] As a result of the surgical procedures, there were ten small (1 cm to 4 cm) keloidal surgical scars left on various parts of his right leg, with most of the scarring being located on his right thigh.[^72]

39     The main dispute is whether the Plaintiff suffers from any residual pain from the fracture. The medical evidence before me in respect of the fracture is largely contained in medical reports, which parties have agreed to admit into evidence and stand as they are.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) The attendance of the orthopaedic doctors was dispensed with by parties.[^74] As such, I did not have the benefit of their clarifications or having their opinions challenged in cross-examination. In the circumstances, I am guided by considerations of consistency, logic, and coherence in considering the opinions rendered in these medical reports.

40     Having considered the available medical evidence, I accept Dr Chang Wei Chun’s[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75) (“Dr Chang”) opinion that the Plaintiff has recovered from his fracture with some permanent pain in the right thigh and knee with strain to the limb (_i.e._, when lifting and carrying patients).[^76] I also accept Dr Chang’s opinion that this pain may improve upon future surgery to remove the intramedullary nail.[^77] In this regard, I do not think that the other medical reports referred to by the Defendant (dated 9 March 2018[^78] and 16 January 2019[^79]), contradict Dr Chang’s opinion. These reports did not directly address the specific complaint of pain _upon strain to the limb_, or more specifically, when the Plaintiff is lifting or carrying heavy objects. As Dr Tay testified, that the Plaintiff was able to walk normally and move in the community did not mean that he had no other major issues with his leg.[^80] The Plaintiff had also complained to Dr Tay about experiencing pain in his right leg when carrying heavy objects in the course of work in 2018 and 2019.[^81] The fact that the Plaintiff did not reflect such a complaint to Dr Tay in 2020 did not, in my view, mean that the pain had resolved by 2020. As Dr Tay had explained, he did not ask the Plaintiff about his orthopaedic issue then because the main issue discussed were his cognitive problems.[^82] It is in this context that the absence of complaint in 2020 must be viewed.

41     However, I am unable to agree with the quantum of award(s) sought by the Plaintiff. He relies on _Loh Chia May v Koh Kok Han_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 181</span> (“_Loh Chia May_”) to submit for an award of $25,000 for the fracture _excluding provision for the scarring_. It is clear to me that the injury and residual disabilities suffered by the plaintiff in _Loh Chia May_ were more severe and extensive than that sustained by the Plaintiff in the present case. The injury in _Loh Chia May_ was an _open_ fracture of the left femur, which involves a break in the skin and necessarily entails more significant damage to the surrounding flesh and tissue than a closed fracture. In terms of long-term disabilities, the plaintiff in _Loh Chia May_ walked with a limp due to shortening of left leg by 1.5cm and had to use an elbow crutch and suffered from aches and pain to her thigh when lying on her left side. She was also at risk of osteoarthritis (likely to experience within 10 to 15 years). By contrast, the Plaintiff can ambulate normally and without difficulty in the community, suffering from pain only upon strain to the limb with some chance of improvement in the future with surgery. There is also no evidence that he is at risk of osteoarthritis.

42     Second, the _total_ quantum being sought for the fracture and the scars (_i.e._, $50,000) is clearly excessive having regard to the Guidelines. An award of $50,000 would fall within the indicative range of damages in the Guidelines (after adjustment for inflation) for the categories of “very severe (leg) injuries short of amputation” requiring “extensive surgery and physiotherapy” with the person “likely to be left with extensive disabilities despite surgery” as well as “serious and/or multiple fractures leading to restricted mobility, deformity and/or shortening of limbs” with a “high risk of osteoarthritis” and “suffering significant disabilities on a long-term basis”. Even when the Plaintiff’s keloidal scars are taken into account, his injuries cannot be said to fall within the aforementioned categories of injuries as described in the Guidelines. The keloidal scars are small, located at parts of the body which normally are or can be covered by clothing, and their effect is largely cosmetic _i.e._, there is no evidence the scars are itchy and painful or that they have affected the Plaintiff’s mobility.

43     The Defendant cites the following precedents:

> (a)      _Musdipa bte Mohamed v Poon Siew Kay & Anor_ (MC Suit No. 22290 of 2001)[\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83) (“_Musdipa_”) – a sum of $16,000 was awarded for a closed supracondylar fracture of the right femur requiring surgery and bone grafting. The plaintiff suffered from long term pain at the fracture site, which was expected to worsen, as well as a 7 cm surgical scar over the right iliac crest.

> (b)      _Aroozoo Kerry Ann v Leow Kwee Fah_ (HC Suit No. 22 of 2006)[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84) (“_Aroozoo_”) – a sum of $18,000 was awarded for a right supracondylar fracture of the right femur which was treated with an intramedullary nallop.

44     In my judgment, a slight uplift from the above awards is warranted on account of (i) the Plaintiff’s many keloidal surgical scars (in this regard, it is also unclear if the plaintiff’s scar in _Musdipa_ was keloidal) _and_ (ii) to account for inflation. I therefore assess damages at **$21,000** for the fracture and keloidal surgical scars. This is well within the indicative range provided by the Guidelines for “moderate (leg) injuries” after adjustments for inflation.

### Undisplaced fracture of the sternum

45     This injury was treated conservatively and has fully healed without any residual disabilities. It will thus fall within the description of “minor chest injury” in the _Guidelines_, with a suggested range of award of $1,500 to $15,000. The Plaintiff also cited the precedent _Chua Chuan Seng v Chua Eng Hwee_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 2258 of 1997)[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85) (“_Chua Chuan Seng_”) where $7,000 had been awarded for a fractured sternum with residual disability of chest pain when coughing.

46     I agree with the Defendant that based on the brief description provided in the Blue Book, the injury in _Chua Chuan Seng_ was more serious than that suffered by the Plaintiff in the present case. However, the age of the precedent also needs to be considered and the effect of inflation factored into the award. In the premises, I find the sum of **$7,000** reasonable and award the same.

### Right neck laceration with keloidal scar

47     The Plaintiff submits that an award of $8,000 should be made for the neck laceration and the resultant 14cm long keloidal scar. The Defendant submits for an award of $3,500.

48     The Plaintiff had undergone a right neck wound exploration to remove the foreign bodies embedded therein.[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86) As for the keloidal scar, the Plaintiff had undergone sessions of intralesional steroid injections which slightly improved cosmesis, although there was still a linear keloidal plaque over his right neck with protuberance over the posterior pole of the keloid as of 1 February 2019.[^87] Photos of the scar taken at a medical examination on 5 March 2019 show a fairly large and visible scar.[^88] Nevertheless, it will appear that the effect of the scar is largely cosmetic in nature. Save for his complaint of occasional tenderness of the scar in February 2018,[^89] there is otherwise no evidence that this scar has affected the Plaintiff’s mobility or is itchy or painful.

49     The _Guidelines_ provide for an indicative range of $1,200 - $1,500 for a single laceration to any part of the body (excluding face) and $3,000 to $6,000 for keloid scars. As for the precedent cited by the Defendant, _Mohan Sankar v Frontbuild Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 2188 of 2009)[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90) (“_Mohan Sankar_”), it is unclear from the brief facts provide if the scars suffered by the plaintiff in _Mohan Sankar_ were also keloidal scars. I further agree with the Plaintiff that the scars in _Mohan Sankar_ were located at a less prominent part of the body as compared to the present case. Inflation will also have to be accounted for.

50     In the circumstances, I assess damages for the laceration and scar at **$6,800**.

## Loss of earning capacity

51     Two issues arise here for my determination:

> (a)     whether general damages for LEC ought to be awarded; and

> (b)     if awarded, how the damages for LEC ought to be quantified in the present case.

### My decision on whether an award of LEC should be made

#### Plaintiff’s employment history

52     The Plaintiff’s highest educational qualification is a National ITE Certificate (“NITEC”) in Electrical Technology (Power & Control) which he obtained in 2015.[\[note: 91\]](#Ftn_91)

53     At the time of the Accident, the Plaintiff was serving National Service as an Emergency Medical Technician in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”). Based on the records adduced, the Plaintiff was downgraded from PES B2 to PES B4 after the Accident,[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92) and this was confirmed by him on the stand.[^93] The Plaintiff eventually completed his National Service on 12 April 2018 with an overall performance of “Outstanding”.[^94]

54     Following the completion of his National Service, the Plaintiff’s employment history was as follows:

> (a)     He was employed as a full time Medic with Lentor Ambulance Pte Ltd (“Lentor”) from 1 June 2018, drawing a monthly basic salary of $1,240 plus a skill allowance of $250 (payable upon obtaining full certification).[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95)

> (b)     A few months later, he left Lentor and joined Unistrong Technology (S) Pte Ltd (“Unistrong”) as an Emergency Ambulance Paramedic Assistant from 15 October 2018, drawing a monthly basic salary of $1,400 plus a skill allowance of $200 (payable upon obtaining the requisite certification).[\[note: 96\]](#Ftn_96) With overtime pay and other allowances, the Plaintiff earned about $2,100 per month.[^97] The Plaintiff was also entitled to AWS and could also be awarded bonuses.[^98]

> (c)     About three years later, the Plaintiff left Unistrong to join SMRT Trains Ltd (“SMRT”) from 6 December 2021 as a Technical Officer 1 (“TO 1”) with a basic monthly salary of $1,800.[\[note: 99\]](#Ftn_99) Mr Chong Kai Jie (“Mr Chong”), a HR Manager with SMRT, testified that the Plaintiff will not work overtime whilst on probation but will earn about 15% more with overtime after that (_i.e._, $2,070 with overtime).[^100] The Plaintiff was entitled to AWS and could also be awarded bonuses 1.5 to 2 months pegged to his basic salary.[^101]

55     As at the date of the last tranche of the AD (_i.e._, 22 March 2022), the Plaintiff was still serving his probationary period at SMRT. His probationary period was due to end by 5 June 2022, subject to him passing certain courses conducted by SMRT Institute.[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102)

#### The applicable legal principles

56     An award for LEC is given as part of general damages to compensate a Plaintiff for the weakening of his competitive position in the open labour market. In _Samuel Chai_, the Court of Appeal set out two _cumulative_ requirements before an award for LEC can be made (at \[36\]):

> (a)     there must be a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life; and

> (b)     it must be established that the plaintiff will, because of his injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market.

57     The Defendant’s position on whether the _first_ requirement above has been met is unclear. In any case, following the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Lua Bee Kiang_, some ambiguity has arisen as to whether the first requirement still needs to be met where a plaintiff’s post-accident occupation at the time of the assessment is different from his pre-accident occupation.

58     In _Lua Bee Kiang_, the plaintiff had been working as a carpenter before the accident and found work as a cleaner after the accident. The defendant argued that no award for LEC ought to be made as there was no evidence that the plaintiff was a risk of losing his “present job” as a _cleaner_. In response, the Court of Appeal held (at \[50\]) that “the question is not whether he is at risk of losing his current, post-accident employment, **but whether he has been prevented from competing in the market for his** **_pre-accident_** **job**” \[emphasis added\].

59     Subsequently, both the decisions of _Samuel Chai_ and _Lua Bee Kiang_ were considered in _Pawel Gajewski v Lee Tong Lynn_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 153</span> (“_Pawel_”). The learned Deputy Registrar sought to reconcile both decisions by distinguishing them on their facts. He observed (at \[44\]) that whilst the Court of Appeal in _Samuel Chai_ had used the language of “present job”, the plaintiff in that case had not, as at the date of the assessment, changed her occupation following the accident. Put simply, the plaintiff’s “present job” was her pre-accident job. This can be contrasted with the plaintiff in _Lua Bee Kiang_ whose present, post-accident job as a cleaner was different from his pre-accident job as a carpenter. He thus held as follows (at \[46\]):

> It therefore appears from the above that **different tests apply depending on whether or not the plaintiff has changed his occupation after the accident**. If there is _no change_ in occupation, the cumulative test stated in _Linda Shaw_ (see \[43\] above) is the governing approach. **If there is** **_any change_** **in occupation, the sole requirement that has to be met is whether the plaintiff “has been prevented from competing in the market for his** **_pre-accident job_****” (****_Lua Bee Kiang_** **at \[50\])**.

> \[emphasis added in **bold**\]

60     The Deputy Registrar opined that the application of a different test where the plaintiff has changed his occupation after the accident was sound as a matter of principle because (at \[45\]):

> There is no good reason to look at the risk of the plaintiff losing his present occupation if he had _changed_ his occupation post-accident. If the law is otherwise, this would disentitle a plaintiff from claiming for LEC if he had opted, following that accident, for a more secure job with little to no risk of unemployment. This would be despite the fact that the plaintiff is no longer able to compete in the market for his pre-accident job.

61     The decision in _Pawel_ was subsequently cited with approval in _Muhammad Saifuddin Bin Hannabi v Kok Chee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 212</span> (“_Muhammad Saifuddin_”) (at \[48\] – \[50\]). The learned District Judge agreed that the reference to “present job” in _Samuel Chai_ had to be read in the context of the facts of that case (_i.e._, the plaintiff was still in the same line of work and had even re-joined her previous employer). She also held that the cumulative test ought not to apply in situations where the plaintiff had left his pre-accident occupation and taken on a different job post-accident:

> … Otherwise, in a situation such as that in _Lua Bee Kiang_, where the post-accident job was of a different nature altogether, and for which the plaintiff drew a lower salary, the plaintiff may be undercompensated if the award of an LEC was pegged to the “present” job instead of the pre-accident, higher paying job.

However, the District Judge ultimately declined to award LEC in _Muhammad Saifuddin_ because the plaintiff had failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that his disabilities put him at a disadvantage in competing for his pre-accident occupation or an equivalent role in the open employment market.

62     It will appear from the decisions in _Lua Bee Kiang_, _Pawel_ and _Muhammad Saifuddin_ that the court’s point of reference in determining if an award for LEC should be made is the plaintiff’s _pre-accident_ occupation. That is to say, the court is concerned with the risk of the plaintiff losing _his pre-accident job_ and consequently, his disadvantage in competing in the open employment market for his _pre-accident_ job or an equivalent role. In my view, this must be the case, given that the general objective of damages is to restore the plaintiff to the position he would have been _but for the accident_. Thus, where a plaintiff changes occupation post-accident, as in the case of _Lua Bee Kiang_, the risk of him losing his pre-accident occupation has materialised or in any case been overtaken by events. In the circumstances, all that is left to establish is whether the plaintiff’s disabilities have put him at a disadvantage in competing for his pre-accident occupation or an equivalent role in the open employment market.

63     In the premises, I find that there is no requirement for the Plaintiff to show that there is a substantial or real risk that he could lose his present job with SMRT.

64     However, if I am wrong and there is such a requirement, I nevertheless find that there is a real risk that the Plaintiff could lose his current job with SMRT. First, the Plaintiff is _not_ an established employee of SMRT. At the time of the AD, he was only a few months into the role and was still on probation. It is not disputed that the Plaintiff must pass certain courses to be confirmed. Given his learning impairment, there is a real concern that he may not succeed in passing these courses. Second, the new role brings with it is own demands, and it is far too early to say that the Plaintiff can cope with them. As the Plaintiff testified, “_I am still on 6 months’ probation, I don’t know if working in this line, I can process mentally and physically_”[\[note: 103\]](#Ftn_103). Mr Chong was also unable to comment on the Plaintiff’s job performance and future prospects for the same reason.[^104] Based on Mr Chong’s testimony, the Plaintiff’s new role requires him to load maintenance equipment from the station platform to a trolley on the track and _vice versa_, and to push the trolley to various points on the track to carry out the maintenance work.[^105] As this involves the lifting of loads of up to 20kg[^106], the possibility that the residual pain in the Plaintiff’s right leg will hinder him cannot be disregarded. Furthermore, whilst the Plaintiff’s previous course of study may be relevant to this role, the fact remains that it is a new line of work which he does not have prior experience or training in, and his ability to adapt may be hindered by his cognitive impairments.

#### Whether an award of LEC is appropriate

65     I am satisfied that the Plaintiff has proven, on the balance of probabilities that he was unable to fully cope with the demands of his role as a paramedic and will be disadvantaged in competing in the employment market for this role or equivalent roles because of his disabilities.

66     The available medical evidence supports the Plaintiff’s claim that the residual pain in his right thigh as well as his memory and learning impairments have adversely impacted his ability to work as a paramedic. I accept Dr Chang’s evidence that the pain in his right thigh and knee on strain affected the Plaintiff’s ability to lift and carry patients and equipment.[\[note: 107\]](#Ftn_107) The Defendant had dispensed with Dr Chang’s attendance and consequently, his opinion in this regard was left unchallenged. The Plaintiff’s complaint of being unable to remember tasks told to him by colleagues[^108] and his inability to react quickly in emergency situations[^109] is further consistent with his auditory memory issues. In this regard, Dr Chong had testified that “\[if\] his work requires receiving a lot of verbal instructions, he might get into trouble”.[^110] When further questioned about this in the context of the plaintiff’s work as a paramedic, he opined as follows:[^111]

> Again it depends on how the instructions are given. If it is simple and one off like go fetch the stretcher, then he should have no issues. But if it is a whole list of instructions like go fetch the stretcher, then get the water, then do that, he may run into issues.

67     Although Dr Tay had opined that the plaintiff was not precluded from working as a paramedic, he also opined that the Plaintiff was “not able to cope fully with his job as a paramedic”.[\[note: 112\]](#Ftn_112) When it was suggested to him that the Plaintiff would be able to cope with suitable modifications to his job like having a checklist and writing down instructions, he testified:[^113]

> These modifications can aid him. However, the nature of a medic’s work is that it is quite unpredictable. There are no fixed tasks or routines, and they have to do shift work. Whilst the advice can allow him to cope to a certain extent, I don’t think \[they\] can allow him to function at his full potential as a medic.

68     Likewise, Dr Lim had opined that the plaintiff was able to carry out his duties with Unistrong but had upon further questioning clarified that the Plaintiff had difficulty in assimilating and acquiring new information from the instruction manuals unique to each ambulance agency.[\[note: 114\]](#Ftn_114) He further opined that this difficulty would hinder the Plaintiff’s career advancement as a paramedic.[^115]

69     In the premises, I am unable to accept the Defendant’s submission that the Plaintiff had overstated the physical and mental difficulties he faced at work in UniStrong.[\[note: 116\]](#Ftn_116) On the contrary, I find the Plaintiff’s evidence generally truthful, measured, and reasonable. At no point did he claim that he was completely unable to work. In fact he quite candidly accepted that he could carry out his duties, but this was because they worked in teams and he would take on the “back end” work and leave the more physically and mentally challenging tasks to his colleagues.[^117] It was further apparent from the Plaintiff’s testimony that he was passionate about his vocation as a paramedic.[^118] This was what the Plaintiff had been trained for and as he put rather bluntly, “there is no other job I know how to do”.[^119] In the premises, the fact that he had persevered for three years in this role should therefore not be held against him, and in my view, is not fatal to his claim.

70     I am further not inclined to place much weight on the fact that the Plaintiff had indicated in his job application form to SMRT “career change”[\[note: 120\]](#Ftn_120) as the reason for leaving Unistrong. Understandably, the Plaintiff would have been reluctant to share the true reasons for leaving his previous employment with a potential employer. I further note that the Plaintiff was not given the opportunity to provide his explanation for this. Even if the Plaintiff had been partly motivated to change occupation because of better career prospects, one cannot ignore the fact that the lack of prospects in his paramedic role was attributable to his disabilities, which prevented him from functioning at his full potential as a paramedic and would hinder his career advancement (see \[67\] and \[68\] above).

71     In short, I find that the Plaintiff’s residual disabilities compromised his ability to work as a paramedic and would no doubt put him at a disadvantage when competing against able-bodied persons in the labour market for that role or equivalent roles.

### The quantum of damages for LEC

#### The applicable approach

72     Parties have advanced different approaches to assess damages for LEC. The Plaintiff submits for an award based on the multiplier/multiplicand method.[\[note: 121\]](#Ftn_121) The Defendant on the other hand urges this court to reject the multiplier/multiplicand method employed by the Plaintiff and to instead adopt a “rough and ready” assessment with reference to the awards in precedent cases.[^122]

73     There exists a line of cases rejecting the use of the multiplier/multiplicand method when assessing damages for LEC. The Court of Appeal provided valuable guidance in _Mykytovich, Pamela Jane v VIP Hotel_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 829</span> (“_Mykytovich_”) (at \[141\]):

> In making awards for loss of future earning capacity, **it is not appropriate to use any of the formulas commonly employed to calculate awards for loss of future earnings, such as the multiplicand and multiplier method** (see _Chai Kang Wei_ at \[15\], citing _Moeliker v A Reyrolle & Co Ltd_ \[1977\] 1 All ER 9 (“_Moeliker_”)). **Instead, the court should award a global sum after taking into account all the factors which are relevant to the particular case at hand**, _eg_, the plaintiff’s age, his skills, the nature of his disability, whether he is capable of undertaking only one type of work or whether he is capable of undertaking other types of work as well (see _Moeliker_ at 141–142). As Judith Prakash J observed in _Clark Jonathan Michael v Lee Khee Chung_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 209</span> (“_Clark Jonathan Michael_”) at \[91\], an assessment of damages for loss of future earning capacity can be an exercise in speculation as the court often does not know the extent to which a plaintiff will be disadvantaged in the open employment market by his disabilities if he has to seek a new position. **The court must take a “rough and ready” approach** (see _Clark Jonathan Michael_ at \[91\]) **and calculate the loss of earning capacity “in the round”** (see _Smith_ at 8), **ultimately arriving at a figure that it considers reasonable in the particular circumstances to compensate the particular plaintiff for the disadvantage which he faces in the open employment market due to his disabilities** (see also _The National Blood Authority_ at \[58\]).

> \[emphasis added in **bold**\]

74     Notwithstanding the Court of Appeal’s guidance in cases like _Samuel Chai_ and _Mykytovich_, there have also been cases where the award for LEC was derived using the multiplier/multiplicand method. For example, _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth (by his litigation representative Pang Choy Chun) v Yeo Chye Huat and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 229</span> (“_Kenneth Quek_”) where the Court of Appeal upheld an award derived using the multiplier/multiplicand method. Unfortunately, no clear guidance or principles on how to derive the multiplicand have been provided by those cases. For instance, no explanation was provided for how the multiplicand of $750 was arrived at by the High Court in _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth v Yeo Chye Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1106</span> (“_Kenneth Quek (HC)_”). On appeal, the Court of Appeal appeared to adopt a comparative approach, comparing the $750 multiplicand to the multiplicand applied in an earlier decision, before concluding that it was reasonable and affirming the decision below.

75     In my view, _Kenneth Quek_ amply demonstrates the difficulty with adopting the multiplier/multiplicand method to assess the award for LEC. To assess an award for LEC, the court is effectively assessing and quantifying the present value of the financial damage which a plaintiff will suffer due to his competitive disadvantage in the employment market _in the future_. As Prakash J (as she then was) observed in _Clark Jonathan Michael v Lee Khee Chung_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 209</span> (“_Clark Jonathan Michael_”), this “_can be an exercise in speculation as often the court does not know the extent to which a plaintiff will be disadvantaged by his disabilities if he has to seek a new position_”. Such an assessment does not lend itself to arithmetical calculation. This can be contrasted with loss of future earnings (“LFE”), which seeks to compensate the plaintiff for the difference between his post-accident and pre-accident income or rate of income. The multiplicand for an award for LFE is therefore derived by taking the difference between the plaintiff’s annual pre-accident income and his annual post-accident income, less any other necessary deductions (_e.g._, income tax). Indeed the multiplicand in _Kenneth Quek_ appears to have been derived in a manner virtually indistinguishable from the “rough and ready” approach advanced in _Samuel Chai_ and _Mykytovich._

76     Turning to the present case, it is unclear how the Plaintiff derived the figure of $600 as his multiplicand. No explanation was provided by the Plaintiff. The multiplicand does not seem to have any nexus to his earnings as a paramedic or to earnings from alternative roles that he might be suited for (for which I note, no evidence was adduced). It is further not clear if the Plaintiff derived the multiplicand by way of comparison with a similarly situated case (like what was done in _Kenneth Quek_).

77     Accordingly, I decline to use the multiplier/multiplicand method to determine the award for LEC in this case. Instead, I will adopt the “rough and ready” method, with reference to comparable past cases to ensure parity.

#### My assessment

78     The Plaintiff is at a competitive disadvantage because of his disabilities:

> (a)     The pain in his thigh and knee on strain will limit the Plaintiff’s ability to take on jobs that require the regular lifting and carrying of heavy loads. However, I also note Dr Chang’s opinion that the Plaintiff’s leg condition may improve after future surgery is carried out to remove the intramedullary nail. This pain may thus pose less of a hindrance in the future.

> (b)     His auditory memory impairment means that he is also not suited for jobs that entail receiving a lot of verbal instructions. His difficulty in acquiring and assimilating new information will likely impact his ability to adapt to new roles and responsibilities in the event he changes jobs or tries to advance in his career. Whilst I accept that that the Plaintiff may overcome these difficulties with modified working arrangements and learning strategies, he will nevertheless be at a disadvantage compared to a person without similar cognitive impairments. I further note that these disabilities are unlikely to improve in the short to medium term.

> (c)     He is unlikely to be able to draw on his previous training and experience as a paramedic when looking for alternative employment, given how he is unable to fully cope in that role and how specialised that skill set is. I note that the Plaintiff has NITEC qualifications and has relied on these qualifications to gain employment as a technician. However, the type of technical roles and intensity at which he can work will necessarily be affected by his physical and cognitive impairments.

79     I also find that the Plaintiff has not adduced sufficient evidence to show that but for the Accident, he would have succeeded in signing on as a Direct-Entry Sergeant (Paramedic) with the SCDF. The Plaintiff claims that he lost the opportunity to sign on due to his injuries which resulted in the downgrading of his PES status. The sole piece of evidence adduced by the Plaintiff to support his claim was a print-out from the SCDF’s website which did not clearly state the requirements for signing on. No representative from the SCDF was called to testify as to whether the Plaintiff was eligible to sign on as a Direct-Entry Sergeant (Paramedic), let alone his chances of successfully doing so if the Accident had not occurred. In the premises, I will not take this alleged loss of opportunity into consideration in assessing the award for LEC.

80     When compared to the precedents, the Plaintiff’s submission of $183,456 for LEC strikes me as rather too high. This is comparable to awards made in cases like _Ronnie Tan_ ($100,000) and _Nirumalan V Kanapathi Pillay v Teo Eng Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 601</span> ($180,000). However, these were cases where the plaintiffs were earning far more pre-accident than the Plaintiff (the former was earning around $120,000 per annum and the latter was the managing partner of a law firm). The Plaintiff’s submission is also comparable to the award made in _Kenneth Quek_. Apart from my reservations about the manner by which the award was arrived at (see \[74\]-\[75\] above), I note that the plaintiff in _Kenneth Quek_ had suffered a serious injury (_i.e._, a below knee amputation of his right leg) which had _significantly_ reduced his employability.

81     I find _Jee Jia Gian v Low Han Chin_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 2603 of 1997)[\[note: 123\]](#Ftn_123) (“_Jee Jia Gian_”) to be a more useful comparator. In _Jee Jia Gian_, the plaintiff was 22 years old at the time of the accident and a technician with the RSAF earning about $2,100 a month. Due to his disabilities from the accident, the plaintiff in _Jee Jia Gian_ was unable to carry out more physically demanding tasks and was instead posted to a desk bound job that did not utilise his skills as an aircraft technician. He was awarded $30,000 for LEC. I note though _Jee Jia Gian_ is a dated precedent, so inflation will have to be factored in here.

82     Taking into consideration my findings above, the above precedent and other relevant factors such as the exigencies and vicissitudes of life and accelerated receipt of a lump sum payment, I assess **$41,000** to be a reasonable and appropriate award for LEC. This roughly translates to the Plaintiff receiving an additional $230 per month, tax free, for the next 30 years of his life based on a discount rate of 5.33% per annum. By way of a comparison, $230 is slightly more than 10% of the monthly salary drawn by the Plaintiff at Unistrong ($2,100) and the average basic salary earned by a TO1 in SMRT ($1,900).

## Conclusion

83     In summary, I awarded the following sums:

84     Accordingly, **$96,865.97** is payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.

85     As regards interest, parties appear to disagree on whether interest ought to be awarded for loss of earning capacity and future medical expenses. In this regard, I find that no interest ought to be awarded for future items of claim. This is because the Plaintiff will not have been kept out of money but will have received it in advance (see the _Blue Book_ at 6-4 and _Ong Kim Teck v Quek Chin Hwa Construction_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCR 19</span> at \[92\] and \[93\]). I therefore grant as follows:

> (a)     interest at 5.33% per annum for general damages for pain and suffering (item 1 in the table above) from the date of the writ of summons to the date of judgment;

> (b)     interest at 2.67% per annum for special damages (item 4 in the table above) from the date of the Accident to the date of judgment; and

> (c)     no interest for loss of earning capacity (item 2 in the table above) and future medical expenses (item 3 in the table above).

86     Parties are to address me on costs separately.
