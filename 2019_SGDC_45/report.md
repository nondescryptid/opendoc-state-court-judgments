4 March 2019

### Principal District Judge Ong Hian Sun:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The Accused, Tan Cher Kuan Cavin, is a 37-year-old male Singaporean.

2       He faced a total of seven charges tendered by the Prosecution, which he pleaded guilty to four of these charges and consented to having the remaining three charges to be taken into consideration (TIC) for the purpose of sentencing.

3       The four charges which the Accused pleaded guilty to read as follows:

(a)     The First Charge (MAC 9903166-2018)

“…that sometime in the month of November 2013, at Singapore, you did promote a collection, to wit, by causing one Jasper Phua to appeal to the public to give money towards a social enterprise program by Joint Creation International, and pursuant to your promotion, a collection was made by the said Jasper Phua at the vicinity of Parkway Parade Shopping Centre sometime in the month of November 2013, without a license authorising you to promote such collection, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 3(2) of the House to House and Street Collections Act (Cap 128, Rev Ed 1985).”

This offence is punishable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.

(b)     The Fourth Charge (MAC 903169-2018)

“…that you, on or about the 29th day of October 2014, in Singapore, failed to comply with an order issued under Section 41A(1) of the Charities Act (Cap. 37, 2007 Rev Ed) requiring you to furnish documents and information relating to the fundraising activities of Alliance Career Entrepreneurship (‘’ACE’’), and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 41A(7) of the said Act.”

This offence is punishable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 1 year or both.

(c)     The Fifth Charge (DAC 912894-2018)

“..that you, on the 29th day of August 2015, at or about 3:20 am, at the main entrance of Parklane Shopping Mall, 35 Selegie Road, Singapore, a public place, did use criminal force on a public servant, namely, one Fan Siew Singes, a Voluntary Special Constabulary (‘’VSC’’) Sergeant of the Singapore Police Force, in the execution of her duty as a police officer, to wit, by using your right hand to hit her left hand, with intent to deter the said public servant from discharging her duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

This offence is punishable on conviction with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine, or with both.

(d)     The Sixth Charge (DAC 931358-2018)

“ …that you on the 30th day of July 2018, at or about 8.30 pm, at 21 Woodlands Checkpoint, Arrival Car Custom Office, Singapore, did import into Singapore for the purpose of trade, a total of twenty-seven (27) goods to which a registered Trade Marks were registered in Singapore belonging to Guccio Gucci S.P.A, was falsely applied, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 49(a) of the Trade Marks Act, Chapter 332.”

This offence is punishable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000/- for each goods or thing to which the trademark is falsely applied (but not exceeding in the aggregate $100,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

4       The three other remaining charges which were taken into consideration for purpose of sentencing are in respect of one further charge under Section 3(2) of Cap 128, one charge under Section 8(1) of Cap 128 and one further charge under Section 49(a) of Cap 332. After hearing the submissions of the Prosecution and the mitigation by the Defence Counsel, I sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $2000 in default one week’s imprisonment as follows:

(a)     The First Charge – 4 weeks’ imprisonment (concurrent);

(b)     The Fourth Charge – 12 weeks’ imprisonment (consecutive);

(c)     The Fifth Charge – 4 weeks’ imprisonment (consecutive); and

(d)     The Sixth Charge – fine of $2000 in default 1 week’s imprisonment.

5       The Accused, being dissatisfied, has appealed primarily against the sentences imposed on him for the first and fourth charges. Subsequently, the Accused appointed another Defence Counsel in his application for an order of stay in execution on sentence and he is currently released on bail pending appeal. I now set out my grounds of decision.

## (2)   Relevant facts from the Statement of Facts (SOF)

6       The Accused pleaded guilty to the statement of facts (SOF) without qualification. The main features of the SOF are reproduced below.

### Facts relating to the First Charge ((MAC 903166-2018)

7       The Accused previously worked as a Team Leader for a company known as “Global Virtue Pte Ltd”, which hired employees to sell vouchers by representing that a portion of the sales would be donated to charity. After investigations, the Accused was administered a stern warning in lieu of prosecution for his involvement.

8       On 21 Aug 2013, the Accused incorporated a company, known as “Joint Creation International” (“JCI”), with ACRA. He was the sole owner and director of JCI.

9       The Accused caused JCI to enter into an agreement dated 14 Oct 2013 with one Spade Auto Pte Ltd. For one month, JCI would sell vouchers at $10 each that would entitle the purchaser to a $50 discount at Spade Auto Pte Ltd.

10     JCI employed at least five people: Seah Chu Wei,[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) Jasper Phua Kian Wee,[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Tan Jieshou,[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) Ryan Lee Wei Xian, and Joseph Wang Yinjing.

11     The witness is Jasper Phua Kian Wee (M/22/Singaporean). At the material time, he was 18 years of age, and working for JCI.

12     The informant identified himself as Mr Mohd. At the material time, he was a security officer of Parkway Parade Shopping Centre.

13     On 8 November 2013, at or about 1:13 p.m., the Police received a call from the complainant with the message “6 of the youngsters are disturbing the shoppers. They are doing the same thing many times. Called Marine Parade NPC, but was told to call 999 should such things happened. They are often at DBS, Watson area.” The incident location was given as Parkway Parade Shopping Centre.

14     On 8 November 2013, at or about 1:13pm, a Marine Parade Neighbourhood police officer spotted the witness selling vouchers to the public in the vicinity of Parkway Parade Shopping Centre. When questioned by the police officer, the witness admitted to:

(a)     Working for JCI to sell items on the basis that the collections would be split equally between the Accused and himself;

(b)     Being told by the Accused that the sales proceeds would go to charity;

(c)     Being told by the Accused that they “should use charity to promote selling of the keychains, so that people will buy”;

(d)     Being told by the Accused to tell the public that the proceeds would go to charity, orphans, and needy people;

(e)     Telling the public to “help the orphans”; and

(f)     Being given a “sales pitch license plate” stating that he was from a broken family (when he was not) and in financial difficulty.

15     At the material time, JCI did not have a license to promote collections.

16     The witness stated that he did not know that JCI did not possess any collection license. For his involvement, he was administered a stern warning in lieu of prosecution.

17     By causing the witness to act for remuneration as collectors for the purposes of a collection without a licence and which a collection has been made, the Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 3(2) of the House to House and Street Collections Act (HHSCA), Chapter 128.

### Facts relating to the Fourth Charge (MAC-903169-2018)

18     After the trial period with Spade Auto expired at or around 13 Nov 2013, JCI was renamed “Alliance Career Entrepreneurship” (“ACE”) with effect from 21 Nov 2013. The Accused then persuaded En Community Services Society (“ECSS”) to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with ACE for a “fundraiser” to be conducted between 10 February 2014 and 10 May 2014.

19     Under the terms of the MOU, ACE would make a monthly donation of between $3,000 to $5,000 to ECSS. Utilising the MOU, the Accused caused ACE to successfully obtain a HHSC license (L/HH/000041/2014).

20     Subsequently, ECSS received multiple complaints about ACE’s employees’ aggressive sales tactics. ECSS then conducted a training session with ACE.

21     However, after the expiry of the MOU between ACE and ECSS, the HHSC license was not renewed by the Police due to the number of complaints received.

22     In addition, no payments were made to ECSS under the MOU.

23     Sometime in 2014, the office of the Commissioner of Charities started receiving complaints from members of the public pertaining to the fundraising activities of ACE.

24     On 29 October 2014 the Accused was issued an order under Section 41A(1) of the Charities Act (CA) by the Commissioner of Charities. This required the Accused to furnish, by 18 Nov 2014, documents relating to the fundraising activities of ACE and information about the beneficiaries, expenditure, and identities of ACE’s staff and volunteers.

25     The Accused did not comply with the order and was given a final warning on 21 Nov 2014. To date, he has not provided any of the required information. The Accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 41A(7) of the said Act.

### Facts relating to the Fifth Charge (DCA-912894-2018)

26     The victim is Fan Siew Singes (F/37). At the material time, she was a Police Voluntary Special Constabulary (“VSC”), holding the rank of Sergeant. She will henceforth be referred to as VSC Fan.

27     On 29 August 2015 at or about 3.23 a.m., police back-up was requested at Parklane Shopping Mall, 35 Selegie Road, Singapore 188307.

28     On 29 August 2015 at or about 3:20 a.m., VSC Fan was on uniformed foot patrol duty with one VSC SSI Goh Teck Lim Ricky, when they came across a commotion at the main entrance to Parklane Shopping Mall. The Accused, his wife, and the Accused’s brother were part of the commotion, which was caused by the Accused’s brother loudly quarrelling over the phone with someone else.

29     VSC Fan and VSC Goh advised the group to disperse, but the group continued to remain at the scene.

30     Being outnumbered and wishing to prevent any allegations of police impropriety, VSC Goh instructed VSC Fan to video record the scene. VSC Fan then took a step back and video recorded the commotion using her mobile phone, which she held in her left hand.

31     The Accused then went up to VSC Fan and used his right hand to hit her left hand, intending to stop her from recording him. This caused her phone to drop to the ground.

32     By using his right hand to hit VSC Fan’s left hand, the accused has used criminal force on a public servant who was executing her duties as a police officer, thereby intending to deter her from discharging her duties as a public servant. Therefore, the Accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code (PC).

33     The victim was not injured and there was no damage to her phone.

### Facts relating to the Sixth Charge (DAC-91358-2018)

34     Sometime at or around 10 July 2018, the Accused came across the idea of selling T-shirts on Facebook. He managed to find a T-shirt supplier from Malaysia. The T-shirts would cost 10 Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR”) per piece, but would cost a discounted price of 7 MYR if at least 100 pieces were ordered.

35     As the T-shirts were from a Malaysian supplier, the Accused also engaged a freelance delivery service provided by a Malaysian male, Chang Huey Shian (“Chang”). This delivery service was advertised on Gumtree.

36     On 23 July 2018, the Accused engaged Chang’s services, requesting him to collect T-shirts from the Malaysian supplier, and deliver them to the Accused. The delivery proceeded without any problems.

37     On 25 July 2018, the Accused engaged Chang’s services a second time. As Chang was unavailable, he referred the job to his friend, one “Din”. Din attempted to deliver the T-shirts, but was stopped by Singapore Customs and had to bring the T-shirts back to the supplier. The Accused knew about the failed delivery, and made arrangements to enter Johor Bahru and collect the T-shirts himself.

38     On receiving the T-shirts, the Accused would take photographs of the T-shirt and advertise them for sale on a Facebook page maintained by himself.

39     The Complainant is Insp Tan Cheng Eng. He is attached to the Intellectual Property Rights Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department.

40     On 30 July 2018, at or about 8.30 pm, officers of the Singapore Customs at Woodlands Checkpoint informed the IPRB that Chang had been detained on suspicion of bringing in counterfeit goods into Singapore.

41     53 pieces of T-shirts were seized as case exhibits. Investigations revealed that these 53 T-shirts were to be delivered to the Accused. The 53 pieces of T-shirts seized are as follows:

(a)     27 T-shirts bearing the Gucci trade mark (the 6th charge); and

(b)     26 T-shirts bearing the Kenzo trade mark (the 7th charge, TIC-ed).

42     On 31 July 2018, at or about 1.50 am, the Accused was interviewed. He admitted that the 27 piece of “Gucci” T-shirts in the possession of the delivery driver were ordered by him, and that he was supposed to receive the goods on that day. The Accused also admitted that the T-shirts were meant for sale on Facebook.

43     The Accused knew that the goods he procured from the Malaysia supplier were counterfeit, and that it was an offence to sell the counterfeit goods in Singapore.

44     The 27 “Gucci” T-shirts were examined by the respective rights owner, and the authentication report concluded that the goods seized were counterfeit products.

45     By virtue of the following, the Accused has committed the offence of “importing into Singapore for the purpose of trade, goods to which registered trademarks are falsely applied” under s 49(a) of the Trade Marks Act (TMA), Chapter 332.

46     No restitution has been made to the trade mark owner.

## (3)   Antecedent Record of the Accused

47     Despite his relatively young age at the time he committed the above offences, the Accused has a long string of previous convictions which included convictions for different types of drug offences, offences involving robbery, rioting, voluntary causing hurt to public servant, forgery for the purpose of cheating and cheating by personation, spanning a period of about 15 years from 13 May 1997 to 16 May 2012.

## (4)   Submissions on Sentence by the Prosecution

48     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 4 weeks for the s3(2) HHSCA offence, 3 months for the s 41A(7) of the CA offence (consecutive) and 4 weeks for the s 353 PC offence (consecutive) and $2000 fine for the s 49(c) of the TMA offence.

49     Sentencing precedents were tendered for my consideration on the appropriate sentences to be meted out for the respective offences. As the accused is primarily contending for lower sentences with regards to the CA and HHSCA offences, I will focus mainly on Prosecution’s submissions for the aforementioned areas.

### S 3(2) HHSCA Offence (MAC 3903166-2018)

50     The Prosecution referred to the unreported case of _PP v Tan Jun Rong Daven_ (MCN-901368-2017), wherein the Accused who was the sole proprietor of Mercy Vision Advertising would hire employees to sell items such as luggage tags, can openers, and stress-relief balls to members of the public. He instructed his employees to tell the members of the public to support low-income and broken families by buying the merchandise, when in fact, the sales proceeds were used by the Accused and his employees for their personal expenses.

51     Two of the Accused’s employees were convicted of acting as collectors under s 3(3) of the HHSCA and were each sentenced to one weeks’ imprisonment. Two other employees (aged 21 and 17) were not charged. For promoting the collection by these four individuals, the Accused was charged with four counts under s 3(2) of the HHSCA. For each charge, he was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment. Two sentences were ordered to run consecutively, giving a total of eight weeks’ imprisonment.

52     As the present Accused was an organiser of collections by others with one TIC-ed charge under s3(2) HHSCA and one TIC-ed charge under s8(1) of HHSCA, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 4 weeks’ imprisonment for his s3(2) offence.

### S41A(7) CHARITIES ACT (MAC-903169-20180)

53     The Prosecution relied mainly on the comparison of sentencing precedents under s39A(2) of the CA to calibrate for the sentence under s41A(7) of the CA. The main contention of the Prosecution was that s41A(7) offences should not be treated less harshly than s39A offences otherwise it will subject the Charity Act to abuse. Both provisions are aimed at protecting the public at every stage of the donation-collection process. Section 39A prevents fund-raising appeals from being conducted without permits. If funds are collected, Section 41A grants the COC the power to order production of documents related to the fund-raising activities, on pain of the penalties under s 41A(7) or s 41B(3). This enables the COC to determine if the collections by the collector are properly transferred to the relevant charity.

54     The Prosecution submitted that a loophole could result as in the present case where the Accused set up an enterprise (ACE) and entered into a purported MOU with a legitimate charity (ECSS) and with the purported MOU, ACE successfully obtained a HHSC licence to make collections from members of the public, but gave none of those collections to ECSS. Since he had an approved HHSC licence, he cannot be charged under s39A(2) of the CA but can only be charged under s 41A(7) of CA if he failed to furnish the requisite documents to the COC.

55     The Prosecution referred to two unreported cases of s39A offences where the benchmark sentence for collectors was 2 months’ imprisonment term and submitted that the present Accused who was an organiser of the collections with higher culpability should be sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment.

56     In _PP v Orozco Jairam Azarcon_ (MAC-800130-2013), the Accused came across an advertisement seeking donations for an NGO named “Yayasan Sejahtera Anak Asia” (“YSAA”). At the material time, YSAA was involved in collecting donations for a recent typhoon that affected the Philippines. The Accused took photographs of the said advertisement, and used them to forge a donation card. He then used the donation card to solicit funds from members of the public along Orchard Road on 14 March 2013, and managed to collect $120. Two weeks later, he did the same thing at Mount Elizabeth Hospital and Orchard Road, and managed to collect $315. The Accused faced, among other forgery charges, two counts under s 39A(2) of the CA. He was sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment for each of the s 39A(2) CA charges.

57     In another case of _PP v So Shan Hanzl Japus_ (MAC-900940-2014), the Accused similarly used a volunteer card purportedly issued by YSAA in order to appeal for cash donations from members of the public. The Accused informed members of the public that the monies would be used to help poor and hungry children in Asia, when he had intended to use the donated monies for his personal use. He managed to collect $52 on that day. He faced a single charge under s 39A(2) of the CA and was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment.

### S353 PENAL CODE (DAC 912894-2018)

58     Based on sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution, custodial sentences ranged between 3 weeks and 5 weeks for s.353 charges. As the Accused is traced with similar violent-related antecedents of rioting, robbery, VCH, VCH to deter public servant from duty and disorderly behaviour, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least 4 weeks’ imprisonment should be imposed for his s353 charge.

### S49(a) TRADE MARKS ACT (DAC 931358-2018)

59     In view of sentencing precedents relating to s49(a) offences and the small size of the Accused’s business in this offence, the Prosecution submitted for a fine of not less than $2,000.

## (5)   Mitigation

60     The Accused is married with three children, aged 5 months, 2 years and 4 years old. His wife is a homemaker taking care of their three children. In his desperation to provide for his family, the Accused sought means of earning income which resulted in the commission of these offences. The Defence Counsel mitigated that the Accused was sincerely remorseful for his wrong doings and sought the lowest possible imprisonment term to minimise hardship to his family members as he is the sole breadwinner of his family.

61     With respect to the Fourth Charge, the Defence Counsel submitted that there was a valid HHSC license and the appropriate sentence should not be pegged to those accused persons who promote collections without the requisite HHSC license. Further the Accused alleged that he was unable to furnish the documents required by the Commissioner of Charities pursuant to the order issued under s 41(A) of the CA because unbeknownst to him, his friends had disposed the documents from his office.

## (6)   Sentencing Considerations

62     The predominant sentencing consideration for offences under HHSCA and CA should be one of deterrence as it is paramount to prevent unscrupulous Accused persons from preying on innocent members of public to donate for any charitable cause which cannot be substantiated.

63     On the accused’s admission to the SOF and TIC charges, it was clear that his modus operandi - whether he was operating with or without the requisite HHSC licence - invariably relied upon instructing his employees to use hard-sale tactics towards canvassing sales of items to unsuspecting members of public for purported charity but to which he could not substantiate.

64     For his First Charge under s3(2) of HHSCA, he committed the offence in the month of November 2013 when he promoted the collections through his employees without the HHSC license while clearly instructing them to inform the public that the sale proceeds would go to charity.

65     In respect of the Fourth Charge under s41A(7) of CA, while the accused managed to secure a HHSC license based on his purported MOU with ECSS, for the period between 10 February 2014 and 10 May 2015 he relied on hard sale tactics to solicit funds for charitable purpose which resulted in ECSS receiving multiple complaints about ACE’s employees. Again, the sales could not be proven for genuine charitable purpose as the accused failed to furnish the documents required by the COC after the expiry of the MOU. Nonetheless, even with aggressive sales tactics, it was not surprising that the accused could not honour his commitment under the MOU to make the monthly donation of $3000 to $5000 to ECSS as this was quite a substantial amount of donation commitment to make and which in all likelihood he could not fulfill.

66     I was unable to accept the Accused’s submission that he could not furnish the documents to the COC because his friends had allegedly disposed them. Moreover, the accused also admitted to the TIC charge under s8(1) of HHSCA that he was unable to furnish the necessary statements of accounts within 60 days after the expiry of his HHSC license on 10 July 2014. Given his admission that he had previously been warned when he was working for Global Virtue Pte Ltd as a Team Leader for selling vouchers with unsubstantiated representations that a portion of the proceeds of sales would go to charity, it would be incumbent on the Accused to take measures in ensuring that he possessed proper documentation to justify any claims that he was involved in promoting collections for charity. It was clear to me that when the accused entered into the MOU with ECSS, he must have misled them with the promise of a huge donation that was beyond his means. Hence, I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that Accused should not be allowed to circumvent the punishment for promoting collections without a requisite license notwithstanding that he managed to secure a HSSC license through the purported MOU with ECSS.

67     In arriving at the appropriate sentence for the CA offence, I took into account the aggravating factor that the accused committed a further s3(2) HHSCA offence, _vide_ another TIC charge, in the month of June 2014 after the expiry of the MOU with ECSS on 10 May 2014. For this offence, he promoted a collection - through an employee - by appealing to the public for donation to another social enterprise program by Passionative Group Pte Ltd without the requisite HHSC license.

68     I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that for his CA offence, I should draw reference to sentencing precedents relating to s39 of CA and treat the Accused as someone who had promoted collections as though he did not possess the requisite HHSC license as clearly, he could not substantiate that the collections were for genuine charitable purpose due to the inability in furnishing the documents required by the COC.

69     I accepted the Accused’s mitigation that he had pleaded guilty at the earliest stage possible but I did not give much weight to his mitigation of the hardship caused to his family as this was brought about by himself due to his commission of the offences. Instead of the 3 months submitted by the Prosecution for the s41A(7) offence, I decided to impose 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

## (7)   Conclusion

70     S307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that where an Accused is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court must order the sentences for at least 2 of those offences to run consecutively.

71     In the present case, I have ordered the HHSCA and the CA sentences of 4 weeks and 12 weeks respectively to run concurrently as essentially the offences were committed by him in the same transaction and the global sentence of 12 weeks in relation to his HHSCA and CA offences would be sufficient deterrence to dissuade him and other like-minded individuals from committing similar offences in the future.

72     I ordered the sentence for his CA offence to run consecutively with the s353 Penal Code offence of which I imposed a sentence of 4 weeks in line with the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution. I also imposed a fine of $2,000 in default one week’s imprisonment for his s49(a) Trade Marks Act offence.

73     The Accused being dissatisfied with his sentence has appealed. He is currently released on bail pending his appeal.
