Civil procedure – Evidence – Submission of no case to answer

Contract – Misrepresentation – Pleadings

17 March 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Background

1       The Plaintiff’s claim in this suit is for damages for misrepresentation in relation to a second-hand Mazda car (“the Vehicle”) which he purchased from the Defendant on 7 June 2018. The alleged misrepresentation concerned the age and the mileage of the Vehicle as shown on its odometer at the time of purchase.

2       According to the Plaintiff, soon after he took possession of the Vehicle, he noticed a distinct rattling sound emanating from the front left of the Vehicle when driven over uneven surfaces. He took the Vehicle to a Mazda Service Centre on 27 July 2018 to have it checked. After some checks were performed, he was informed by Mazda that although the odometer of the Vehicle read 12,310 km then, the electronic log of the Vehicle revealed the actual mileage to be 76,139 km. Mazda concluded that the odometer of the Vehicle had been tampered with, and voided the warranty of the Vehicle.

3       The Plaintiff contacted the Defendant to rescind the sale agreement. Discussions ensued between the parties, the terms of which included the trade-in of the Vehicle and the Plaintiff’s purchase of a replacement vehicle. Eventually, however, there was no amicable resolution. The Plaintiff sold off the Vehicle in January 2019 at a loss. He computed his loss at $11,098.13[^1] after taking into account the depreciation of the Vehicle, and claims this sum as damages.

4       At the trial, the Plaintiff testified on his own behalf. He also subpoenaed a representative from Mazda (PW-1) to give evidence in support of his case. The testimony of the Mazda representative, a customer service officer, did not assist the Plaintiff’s case. Notably, PW-1’s evidence-in-chief was adduced orally. He was unable to recall the issues concerning the Vehicle, and a document from Mazda (“the Mazda Invoice”) which the Plaintiff was relying on to prove tampering of the odometer was not referred to him.

5       After the Plaintiff closed his case, counsel for the Defendant made a submission of no case to answer. When asked by the Court, counsel confirmed the Defendant’s position and made an express election not to call evidence.

## Applicable test for submission of no case to answer

6       As succinctly explained by Chan Seng Onn J in _Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 1004</span> at \[209\], the test to apply in a submission of no case to answer is whether the plaintiff’s evidence at face value establishes no case in law, or whether the evidence led by the plaintiff is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that his burden of proof has not been discharged. This does not, however, mean that an adverse inference will be drawn immediately against a defendant simply because it chooses to submit a “no case to answer”. The court is to consider all the admissible evidence placed before it including the evidence elicited from the plaintiff in cross-examination that was or was not in favour of the defendant. Chan J had also helpfully made reference to the following passage in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 10 (LexisNexis, 2006 Reissue) at para 120.025 with regard to how a court should evaluate the evidence where a party submits no case to answer:

> “… \[T\]he evidence is subjected to a minimal evaluation, as opposed to a maximal evaluation … If, however, there is no evidence in support of any fact in issue, or any evidence is manifestly unreliable and to be excluded on that score, a submission of no case to answer will succeed.”

7       More recently, a submission of no case to answer was made in _Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff (administrator of the estates of Shaikah Fitom bte Ghalib bin Omar Al-Bakri and others) and others v Harun bin Syed Hussain Aljunied and others and other suits_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 386</span> (“_Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff”)._ The plaintiffs were the administrators and/or beneficiaries of the estates of the original lessees of 3 adjacent properties in Upper Dickson Road. 999-year leases had been carved out of the freehold interests in the 3 properties back in 1877, and the reversionary interests had been acquired by one Ahmad Aljunied. The first and second defendants claimed to be the present trustees of the estate of Ahmad Aljunied which apparently had not been fully administered, while the fourth to seventh defendants were the former trustees. In 1994, the fourth to seventh defendants had purportedly conveyed the reversionary interests in the 3 properties to the third defendant, free of the leasehold interests.

8       The plaintiffs sought declarations that their leasehold interests, purportedly terminated by the defendants, subsisted. They further claimed fraud and conspiracy against the defendants. At the trial, only the first plaintiff testified as a witness for the plaintiffs. Among the defendants, the fourth, fifth and seventh defendants did not participate in the proceedings. The first, second and sixth defendants (referred to in the judgment as ‘the active Defendants’) submitted there was no case to answer. The dicta of the High Court (per Aedit Abdullah JC, as His Honour then was) explaining the practical effect of a submission of no case to answer at \[29\] and \[30\] of the judgment is particularly instructive:

> “29    A submission of no case to answer meant that the active Defendants chose to stand their case on the inadequacy of the Plaintiffs’ evidence: the affidavits that the active Defendants had filed would not be admitted as evidence at all. Conversely, however, _the Plaintiffs’ case rested solely on the evidence adduced. There is no rule of evidence that the evidence of a plaintiff is to be accorded full weight simply because of the defendant’s election of no case to answer. What must be determined is whether there was any evidence adduced by the plaintiff that prima facie establishes the elements of his claim. If so, the plaintiff succeeds:_ _Lim Swee Khiang v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 745</span>.

> 30    Thus, in the present case, the Plaintiffs had to show that their evidence, namely that of their sole witness, established the elements of the various heads of claim. _A prima facie basis requires that the evidence, uncontradicted and unless inconsistent with itself, proves facts which are elements of particular claims_. …. ”

_(emphasis in italics are mine)_

9       Just like in _Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff_, the Defendant before me had elected to stand its case on the inadequacy of the Plaintiff’s evidence. Bearing in mind the principles set out above, what I had to determine was whether the evidence adduced from the Plaintiff and PW-1 had established the elements of his claim in misrepresentation.

## The pleadings

10     Before dealing with the Defendant’s submissions, it would be useful to set out the relevant portions of the parties’ respective pleaded cases.

11     The Plaintiff had pleaded in his Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1)(“ASOC”) as follows:

> _2_.     _Some time on or about 7 June 2018, the Plaintiff visited the Defendant’s Showroom with the intention of purchasing a second-hand car. The Plaintiff was attended to by the Defendant’s sales representative, Mr David Lim. The Plaintiff indicated to Mr Lim that he wished to purchase a second-hand car which was (i) relatively new, (ii) had mileage of less than 10,000 km, and (iii) was covered by manufacturer warranty._

> _3_.     _On that basis, the Defendant recommended the Plaintiff a Mazda car … (“the Vehicle”). The Defendant’s employee, Mr David Lim, made the following statements of (apparent) fact relating to the Vehicle, namely that:_

>> _a_.     _the Vehicle was_ **_1 year and 10 months old_** _; and_

>> _b_.     _the Vehicle’s_ **_mileage was about 8,200 km, as revealed by the odometer_** _(the “_ **_Representation_** _”). The Defendant also made statements to the effect that the Vehicle has low mileage as observed from the odometer._

> _4_.     _Induced by and acting in reliance upon the Representation that the alleged Vehicle specification satisfied his requirement, the Plaintiff agreed to purchase the Vehicle from the Defendant, and the Defendant agreed to sell the Vehicle to the Plaintiff for the price of S$66,800.00 (being the purchase price of S$66,000.00 with S$800.00 administrative fee) (the “Purchase Price”). The parties entered into an agreement dated 7 June 2018._

> _..._

> _9_.     _On 27 July 2018, .... the Plaintiff took the Vehicle to a Mazda Service Centre (“Mazda”) for servicing .... Mazda informed the Plaintiff that although the odometer of the Vehicle read 12,310 km, the electronic log revealed the Vehicle’s actual mileage to be 76,139 km. The assessment concluded that the Vehicle odometer had been tampered with._

> _..._

> _12_.     _As the act of tampering with the odometer is a deliberate act, the Plaintiff pleads that the Defendant had made the Representation fraudulently, in that the Representation was known to be false. Further and/or in the alternative, as the Defendant is a veteran in the industry, the Defendant ought to have known that the Representations were made recklessly without verifying the actual mileage of the Vehicle._

> _13_.     _Further or in the alternative, if, which is not admitted, the Representation was not made fraudulently, the Plaintiff will rely upon the provisions of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390) entitling him in the circumstances to the relief claimed._

> _14_.     _Immediately upon his discovery, the Plaintiff contacted the Defendant to inform it that the Plaintiff wished to be restored to his original position prior to having entered into the agreement. The Defendant has not complied with the Plaintiff’s reasonable demands to date._

> _..._

> _17_.     _As a result of the Defendant’s misrepresentation and the matters set out above, the Plaintiff has suffered a total loss .. “_

12     In its Amended Defence, the Defendant denied paragraphs 3 and 4 of the ASOC, and specifically, the Representation as set out in the paragraph 3. As to the allegation of tampering of the odometer, this was not admitted and the Plaintiff was put to strict proof.

13     The Defendant also pleaded, in the alternative, that it was an express condition of the agreement that the Defendant did not guarantee that the odometer reading of the Vehicle at the point of sale was correct. Further, by entering into the sale agreement, the Plaintiff had accepted that the Vehicle had been sold in good order and had expressly accepted the Vehicle in an 'as is' condition.

14     With regard to the Plaintiff’s claim under the Misrepresentation Act (_pleaded in \[13\] of the ASOC_), the Defendant pleaded that even if any representations were made to the Plaintiff, which were denied, the Defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that the representations were true, particularised as follows:

> (a)     The odometer on the Vehicle was stated as around 8,200 km in or around 7th June 2018;

> (b)     There were no visible signs that the odometer of the Vehicle had been tampered with and no reason to suspect that the odometer had been tampered:

> (c)     To the Defendant's best knowledge, there was still valid warranty coverage by Mazda on the Vehicle at that point of time: and

> (d)     There were no reasonable methods that could have been employed by the Defendant to verify the actual mileage of the Vehicle at that point of time.

Accordingly, the Defendant denied liability under s. 2 of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap. 390).

## The evidence adduced at the trial in the Plaintiff’s case

15     At the trial, the Plaintiff’s counsel chose to call the representative from Mazda, one Mr Mohammad Yassir bin Abdul Khalid, to testify before putting his client on the witness stand. PW-1, who testified under subpoena, gave evidence to the effect that:-

> (1)     He was, and is, a customer service officer working at Trans Eurokars Pte Ltd, the authorised Mazda agent.

> (2)     His scope of work as a customer service officer was to attend to customers who bring their vehicles for servicing.

> (3)     Within his scope of work, he would conduct checks on the interior and exterior of the customers’ vehicles. For the exterior, he would check for scratches and dents. For the interior, meaning the cabin of the vehicle, he would check if any part was damaged or torn, and whether any valuable items were in the vehicle. These details would be noted down so that there would be no dispute when the vehicle is handed over to the customer. There is an “SOP” (standard operating protocol) that he follows.

> (4)     He does not help customers to register for the Mazda warranty.

> (5)     He does not do any servicing of the vehicles. Servicing, or the “engine” side of the work, such as oil change, checking that the vehicle is safe, is all done by the technicians at the workshop, and not by him. Checking the odometer is also done by the workshop, and not by him.

> (6)     While he could recall that the Plaintiff had brought the Vehicle in for servicing on 27 July 2018, he could not remember what checks were done on the Vehicle, or what issues were raised. Neither could he recall what reports had been given to the Plaintiff, or what problems were actually surfaced in relation to the Vehicle.

> (7)     In cross-examination, he agreed with counsel for the Defendant that a customer, whose vehicle was under warranty, would still have to pay for items like oil change and spark plugs when they bring their vehicle in for servicing. A customer need not pay for any major overhaul of the engine of a vehicle which is under warranty.

16     PW-1 did not bring with him any documents to show to the court, and was not shown any document pertaining to the Vehicle.

17     The Plaintiff was the second witness to testify. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) sworn on 22 January 2019, he had averred as follows:

> _16_.     _On (27 July 2018), I took the Vehicle to a Mazda Service Centre located at 5 Ubi Close, Singapore 408605 (“_ **_Mazda_** _”) to have the Vehicle checked in order to resolve the issue stated at paragraph 14 above. After performing some checks (“the_ **_Diagnostic Check_** _”), Mazda informed me that even though the reading on the odometer of the Vehicle was 12,310 km at that point in time, the electronic log revealed the Vehicle’s actual mileage to be 76,139 km (the “last recorded mileage”). Mazda also concluded that the odometer had been tampered with. A copy of the Vehicle assessment dated 27 July 2018 is annexed hereto and exhibited as “_ **_TYMC-3_** _”._

> _17_.     _Mazda also informed me that as a result of the tampering, the warranty of the Vehicle was rendered void. Upon hearing this, I was shocked and taken aback, as having the Vehicle under a Mazda warranty was a key factor which I had considered when making the purchase of the Vehicle. If I had known, at the point of purchase, that the Vehicle’s Mazda warranty would be void and that the Vehicle actually had a mileage of over 70,000 km, I would never have bought the Vehicle._

> _18_.     _As a result of the Diagnostic Check, Mazda also informed me that many parts of the Vehicle were worn out. This included the Vehicle’s four engine mountings, two lower arms and four brake pads which needed replacement._

18     It should be noted that the Defendant had objected to the above paragraphs of the Plaintiff’s AEIC as containing hearsay in a Notice of Objections to Contents of Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief filed on 1 February 2019. There was also a specific objection to Exhibit TMYC-3, the copy of the Mazda Invoice, on the grounds that it contains hearsay, opinion and/or belief.

19     During his cross-examination by counsel for the Defendant, the Plaintiff gave the following evidence:

> (1)     He has a law degree and works as an in-house counsel.

> (2)     With respect to his pleaded case that the Defendant had made 2 representations to him, the first representation that the Vehicle was 1 year 10 months old was factually correct as the Vehicle registration date was in September 2016. On the second representation that the Vehicle’s mileage was about 8,200 km as revealed by the odometer, he agreed that he had seen the odometer reading on the date he attended at the Defendant’s showroom, and it showed about 8,200 km.

> (3)     His case of misrepresentation by the Defendant was based entirely on what the Mazda service personnel had told him when he brought the Vehicle there for servicing. He agreed that he had no independent evidence whatsoever of any misrepresentation by the Defendant other than what the Mazda representative informed him.

> (4)     He had signed on the sale agreement[^2] (“the Sales Invoice”) but did not read the conditions of sale stated on the back of the document as he was excited to buy the Vehicle.

> (5)     If he had read condition 12 which stated that, “_The seller do not guarantee that the odometer of the car is correct”_, he would not have bought the Vehicle. He agreed that this would have been a material term for his consideration.

> (6)     He disagreed that he was bound by the terms and conditions stated on the back of the Sales Invoice.

## Defendant’s submissions of no case to answer

20     In submitting no case to answer, the Defendant canvassed 2 main points as being fundamental flaws in the Plaintiff’s case, namely that,

> (1)     the Plaintiff’s pleaded case on misrepresentation was defective; and

> (2)     the evidence adduced from PW-1 and the admissibility of the Mazda Invoice.

### Defective pleading

21     With regard to the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, the Defendant pointed out that the Plaintiff’ had not pleaded any particulars of fraud or negligence on the part of the Defendant.

22     Further, as the pleaded cause of action was misrepresentation, the Plaintiff had to show that the representations allegedly made by the Defendant (_namely, that the Vehicle was 1 year 10 months old; and that its mileage was about 8,200 km as revealed by the odometer as pleaded at paragraph 3 of the Amended Statement of Claim (“ASOC”)_) were false. However, during cross-examination, the Plaintiff had admitted both representations to be true.

23     The representation on the age of the Vehicle was a true factual statement as shown on the copy of the Vehicle’s registration card in the Agreed Bundle of Documents. At the time of purchase in June 2018, the Vehicle was 1 year 8 months old.

24     The representation on the odometer mileage reading was also true as the Plaintiff confirmed during cross-examination that he did see the odometer reflecting a mileage of about 8,200 km at the time of purchase. It was not the Plaintiff’s pleaded case that the Defendant had represented to him that, (i) the odometer reading was free of defects, had not been adjusted; or (ii) that the odometer reflected the true and accurate reading of the mileage of the Vehicle.

25     Based on the Plaintiff’s pleaded case and the Plaintiff’s own evidence, there was clearly no misrepresentation.

### Evidence of PW-1, the Mazda representative

26     The second plank of the Defendant’s submission of no case was on the evidence adduced from PW-1. The Defendant pointed out that it was clear from the start that PW-1 had a poor recollection of the events on that specific day when the Plaintiff brought the car to the workshop. He could only give general comments as to his scope of work. Crucially, he did not undertake any diagnosis of the Plaintiff’s car.

27     It was clear from the pleadings that the Plaintiff was put to strict proof in relation to the issue of the mileage discrepancy as the Defendant did not accept the assertion that there was any discrepancy. However, nothing was asked of PW-1 relating to the diagnosis of the Plaintiff’s car or the Mazda Invoice.

28     Even if the Mazda Invoice had been referred to PW-1, it appeared from his testimony that he would not have been able to give any evidence as to whether any robust checks or diagnosis were conducted to prove that the mileage appearing on the odometer was not the true and accurate mileage of the Vehicle.

29     The Plaintiff’s pleaded case also asserted that as a result of the alleged mileage discrepancy, Mazda had voided its warranty. On this issue, the Plaintiff was again relying solely on the evidence of PW-1. As it turned out, he could not give any evidence on this warranty issue. He agreed with the Defendant’s counsel that the car came with a basic manufacturer’s warranty and that a customer would be required to pay for regular servicing items.

### Admissibility of the Mazda Invoice

30     The Defendant pointed out that the Mazda Invoice did not become part of the admitted evidence simply by putting it in the Plaintiff’s AEIC. The Defendant had registered its objection both to the authenticity and also to the contents of the Mazda Invoice before the trial. This was by way of its Notice of Objections to filed on 1 February 2019 as well as the exchange of email correspondence between solicitors on the preparation of the Agreed Bundle of Documents. The Mazda Invoice was not included in the Agreed Bundle of Documents. It was only in the Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, marked but not admitted.

31     The Mazda Invoice was never shown to PW-1 and not part of the evidence before the Court. Accordingly, there was no need for the Defendant to cross-examine PW-1 on the document since it was not admitted into evidence.

32     Even if PW-1 had been referred the Mazda Invoice in the Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, he could not have shed any light on its contents. The document itself could not prove that the odometer had been tampered with. The contents of the document had to be explained, and it was evident that the Plaintiff should have called a witness from the diagnostic department of Mazda to give evidence instead of PW-1.

33     In conclusion, the Defendant submitted that even if the Court were to find that the Plaintiff’s pleaded case was sufficient, it still had no case to answer since the Plaintiff had failed to prove a _prima facie_ case even on his own evidence.

### The Plaintiff’s submissions

34     The thrust of the Plaintiff’s submission was this - since the Defendant had elected not to put before the Court its explanation of the events that had happened, the Court _must_ find that the Plaintiff’s _prima facie_ case had been established based on the facts and evidence adduced by the Plaintiff.

35     The various points made in the written and oral closing submissions by counsel for the Plaintiff can be distilled as follows:

> (1)     The Mazda Invoice, which had been exhibited in the Plaintiff’s AEIC as well as included in the Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, forms a crucial component of the Plaintiff’s case since it contains statements proving that the odometer of the Plaintiff’s car had been tampered with.

> (2)     The Mazda Invoice had been properly admitted as evidence through the respective trial bundles, and any consideration should go to the proper weight to be assigned to this evidence. This was in accordance with the Court of Appeal decision in _Jet Holding Ltd and Ors v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Anor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGCA 20</span> _(“Jet Holding”)._

> (3)     The Mazda Invoice should not be deemed as hearsay evidence. Even if the document had been made by the technicians within Mazda, it constituted a first-hand account of the assessments and checks done by the technicians on the Plaintiff’s vehicle. The statements that had been put into writing in the Mazda Invoice, which concluded that the odometer had been tampered with, were in fact first-hand statements made by the technicians based on what they had personally witnessed in the diagnosis of the Plaintiff’s vehicle. Nothing therein would constitute hearsay evidence.

> (4)     Even if the Mazda Invoice were to constitute hearsay evidence, the document would nonetheless be admissible under s 32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (“EA”) as an exception to the hearsay rule, following the Court of Appeal decision of _Gimpex Ltd_ v _Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 686</span> (“_Gimpex_”), it being a document that was _“compiled by a person acting in the ordinary course of a trade, business, profession or occupation based on information supplied by other persons”_. From a plain and literal reading of s 32(1)(b)(iv) EA, there is no requirement for the person who had prepared the document to have personal knowledge of the information contained therein. Therefore, s 32(1)(b)(iv) would _prima facie_ be sufficiently broad to permit the admission of the Mazda Invoice for the purposes of proving that the odometer had been tampered with.

> (5)     The Plaintiff’s pleadings had established a _prima facie_ case of misrepresentation, and fell squarely within the decision of _Nurlinda Lee @ Lee Beng Hwa and another v Doktor Kereta Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 188</span> (“Nurlinda Lee”).

> (6)     As to the truth of the contents of the Mazda Invoice, the Defendant had not raised any objections thereto in the Whatsapp chat log of messages exchanged between the Defendant’s sales representative, Mr David Lim, and the Plaintiff exhibited at page 57 of the Bundle of AEICs. The Whatsapp chat log served as incontrovertible circumstantial evidence for the purposes of proving that the odometer of the vehicle had in fact been tampered with.

> (7)     As the Defendant had elected not to adduce any evidence to explain the facts as contained in the Mazda Invoice, the only evidence before this Court would be the facts as recorded in the Mazda Invoice.

## Issues

36     Based on the submissions canvassed from both sides, the issues I had to deal with in determining if the Defendant has a case to answer were:

> (1)     What facts does the Plaintiff have to prove in order to establish a _prima facie_ case of misrepresentation?

> (2)     Has the Plaintiff adduced evidence to prove the essential elements in his case of misrepresentation? This issue necessarily leads to the following sub-issues:

> (a)     Is the Mazda Invoice admissible evidence?

> (b)     If the Mazda Invoice is hearsay evidence, is the evidence admissible under the exception in s 32(1)(b)(iv) EA?

### What facts does the Plaintiff have to prove in order to establish a prima facie case of misrepresentation?

37     In _Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 435</span> (“_Panatron”_), the Court of Appeal explained at \[14\] that the essential elements of a cause of action in fraudulent misrepresentation are the following:

> (a)     a representation of fact made by words or conduct;

> (b)     the representation must have been made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff or by a class of persons which includes the plaintiff;

> (c)     the plaintiff had acted upon the false representation;

> (d)     the plaintiff suffered damage by acting upon the false representation; and

> (e)     the representation must have been made with the knowledge that it was false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it was true.

38     At paragraph 3 of the ASOC, the Plaintiff had pleaded the 2 representations of fact made to him orally by the Defendant’s sales representative. While the first representation that “_the Vehicle was 1 year 10 months old_” was expressly admitted to be true, the second representation as to the mileage of the Vehicle, as pleaded in paragraphs 9 and 12 of the ASOC, was alleged to be fraudulent due to the tampering of the odometer.

39     The Plaintiff had compared his case to the facts in _Nurlinda Lee_ to contend that his case was adequately pleaded. As pointed out by counsel for the Defendant to which I agree, _Nurlinda Lee_ was of no assistance as it was a decision by a deputy registrar granting summary judgment on a fraudulent misrepresentation claim which was subsequently overruled. Further, I should add that the pleaded case in _Nurlinda Lee_, which I had occasion to peruse, was vastly different. It had detailed particulars of the representations made, by words and by conduct, the reliance placed by the plaintiffs thereon, as well as full particulars of the fraudulent conduct alleged on the part of the defendants. Such particulars are clearly lacking in the present case.

40     While I agreed with counsel for the Defendant that the Plaintiff ought to have expressly pleaded the particulars of fraud in his ASOC, I did not think that the lack of particularisation in this instance was so fatal to the Plaintiff’s claim such that it should be dismissed without calling on the Defendant to answer. The ASOC is sufficiently clear as to what the representation was, how it was made, and to whom and by whom it was made. In any case, the Defendant was able to mount a substantive defence to the pleaded claim without the need to apply to the Court for particulars. Notwithstanding the lack of proper particularisation of the fraud alleged on the part of the Defendant, I was of the view that the essential elements of the cause of action in fraudulent misrepresentation as enumerated in _Panatron_ could be discerned from the narrative set out in the ASOC.

41     Insofar as the essential elements of the claim in misrepresentation are concerned, the material facts which the Plaintiff had to prove, as could be gleaned from the ASOC, to establish his case can be stated as follows:

> (1)     the Defendant had made a representation that the mileage of the Vehicle was 8,200 km as shown on the odometer on the date that the Plaintiff purchased the Vehicle (_at ASOC \[3b\]_);

> (2)     the Plaintiff was induced by this representation on the mileage of the Vehicle to enter into the contract (_at ASOC \[4\]_);

> (3)     the representation was false as the odometer had been tampered with, as the actual mileage of the Vehicle was much greater than what was shown on the odometer (_at ASOC \[9\]_);

> (4)     the Defendant had made the representation with the knowledge that it was false, or without any genuine belief that it was true (_at ASOC \[12\]_); and

> (5)     the Plaintiff had suffered damage by acting on the false representation on the mileage of the Vehicle shown on its odometer (_at ASOC \[17\]_).

### Has the Plaintiff adduced evidence to prove the essential elements in his case of misrepresentation?

42     The averments in the Plaintiff’s AEIC at \[6\], \[7\] and \[8\] narrating his interaction with the Defendant’s sales representative, without any countervailing evidence from the Defendant, would serve as _prima facie_ evidence of the making of the representation and the inducement on the Plaintiff to purchase the Vehicle. Specifically, they relate to the material facts essential to the Plaintiff’s claim enumerated at \[41(1)\] and \[41(2)\] above.

43     As for the element of knowledge or intention on the part of the Defendant in \[41(4)\], again without any countervailing evidence from the Defendant, the necessary inference would be made against the Defendant. This would, however, be subject to the Plaintiff proving the crucial and material fact in \[41(3)\], namely the falsity of the odometer reading which will be dealt with in more detail below.

44     In relation to the element of damage in \[41(5)\], _prima facie_ proof of the loss suffered by the Plaintiff has been computed at \[48\] of his AEIC.

#### Has the Plaintiff proven that the odometer of the Vehicle was tampered with, thus rendering the mileage reading false?

45     It bears noting that the Defendant had, from the very outset, put the Plaintiff to strict proof of the allegation that the odometer had been tampered with. Since fraud was being alleged, the Plaintiff ought to have been aware that he would be required to adduce sufficiently compelling evidence to prove his allegation.

46     The law is clear as to the standard of proof for fraud. In _Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff_ , the learned Judge had helpfully articulated it thus, at \[50\]:

> “To prove fraud, the usual civil standard of proof of balance of probabilities applies, but the strength and cogency of the evidence that must be furnished before the court would conclude that such serious an allegation is established on this standard is relatively higher than that in most other civil claims. By the same token, when, as in the present case, the plaintiff is only required to establish his case on a prima facie basis, the court will still not lightly draw inferences on fraud without sufficient proof.”

47     As acknowledged in the Plaintiff’s submissions, the most crucial aspect of the Plaintiff’s case stands on the falsity of the odometer reading. Evidence had to be adduced that the odometer had been tampered with to render its reading false in order to prove that the representation on the mileage was false. According to the Plaintiff, the Vehicle had undergone a diagnostic check at Mazda which had uncovered the tampering of the odometer. One would then have expected the Plaintiff to call the Mazda engineer or technician who conducted the test to come to court and testify as to his findings and conclusion. If any document had been generated which contained such findings, the original should have been produced to the court and the maker called to prove the truth of its contents. Had these steps been taken by the Plaintiff, he would have undoubtedly presented a compelling case for the Defendant to answer.

48     Unfortunately, the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff on the tampering of the odometer was limited to only his averments in his AEIC which had been objected to as hearsay by the Defendant from the outset of the trial. Looking at those statements, I had no reservation in upholding the Defendant’s objections. The statements were classic examples of hearsay as regards the odometer tampering which was the fact in issue here. At \[16\] of his AEIC, the Plaintiff had stated,

> _“After performing some checks, …_ _Mazda informed me_ _that even though the reading on the odometer of the Vehicle was 12,310 km at that point in time, the electronic log revealed the Vehicle’s actual mileage to be 76,139 km (the “last recorded mileage”)._ _Mazda also concluded_ _that the odometer had been tampered with.”_

(emphasis by underlining, is mine)

49     To compound the Plaintiff’s difficulty, he had expressly conceded during cross-examination that he had no independent evidence of any misrepresentation by the Defendant other than what the Mazda representative informed him. He agreed with counsel for the Defendant that his case of misrepresentation was based entirely on what Mazda had told him when he brought the Vehicle there for servicing.

50     The Mazda Invoice was undoubtedly a crucial document in support of the Plaintiff’s case since it apparently contains a statement by Mazda to the effect that the odometer of the Vehicle had been tampered with. Consistent with its stance in requiring strict proof of the Plaintiff’s allegations, the Defendant had objected to the Mazda Invoice both as to its authenticity and its content. It was therefore not included in the Agreed Bundle of Documents, but separately compiled in the Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents. Objection had also been taken to its inclusion as an exhibit in the Plaintiff’s AEIC in the Notice of Objections filed by the Defendant on 1 February 2019. The onus therefore lay on the Plaintiff to prove both the authenticity of the Mazda Invoice and the truth of the matters stated therein.

51     The mode of proving a document is set out in ss 66 to 67 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). A clear illustration of how these provisions operate was given by the High Court in _Jet Holding Ltd & Ors v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 417</span> (“_Jet Holding (HC)”)_ at \[146\] to \[149\]. Admissibility of the documents tendered by the plaintiffs in _Jet Holding (HC)_ to prove damages was in issue. The documents which were photocopies had been put together in a bundle (“Damages Bundle”) and exhibited in a witness’s affidavit. They were produced at the trial as plaintiffs’ documents and objections on them had been taken at the trial. The High Court (per Belinda Ang J) ruled the Damages Bundle to be inadmissible. Her Honour’s ruling was affirmed on appeal, and her judgment received a well-deserved commendation from the Court of Appeal on the comprehensive analysis of all the legal issues therein. It would be instructive to reproduce the relevant portions which deal with the issue at hand:

> 146    I begin with the best evidence rule, which is that the contents of documents must under s 66 of the Evidence Act be proved by primary evidence (_ie_ the originals themselves) except in situations falling within s 67. The original documents are to be produced to the court for inspection: s 64 of the Act. Secondary evidence (_eg_ photocopy) is, however, allowed only upon satisfaction of the existence of the circumstances mentioned in s 67. Section 67 lists the cases in which secondary evidence relating to documents may be given. A document produced as primary evidence or secondary evidence will have to be proved in the manner laid down in ss 69–75. The making, execution or existence of a document has, for instance, to be proven by the evidence of the person who made it or one of the persons who made it, or a person who was present when it was made. …

> …… Documents are not ordinarily taken to prove themselves or accepted as what they purport to be. There has to be an evidentiary basis for finding that a document is what it purports to be.

> 147    As a document does not by itself prove the matter expressed therein, the burden is on the party who asserts its accuracy or truth to prove the facts stated therein like any other fact in the absence of any specific admission or agreement on the facts therein contained:

> ...

> The contents of the documents would have had to be proved by someone having personal knowledge of the transactions reflected in the documents.

> …

> 149    In the context of the present case, no original documents were produced at all to the court for inspection. Nothing was said about the whereabouts of the original documents. There was no explanation as to why they were not tendered. What (the plaintiffs) did was to rely on photocopies (_ie_ secondary evidence of the contents of documents) without first bringing themselves within any of the exceptions in s 67 of the Evidence Act. As stated a plaintiff, who seeks to adduce secondary evidence of the contents of a document, must discharge the burden of proving the existence of any circumstances bringing the case within any of the exceptions in s 67. In fact, the plaintiffs here did not address s 67 at all which means that there is nothing before the court to warrant the admission of secondary evidence of the contents of the documents identified as “HEVR-1 Damages Bundle” Vols 1 to 6 and “HEVR-2” vol 2 to prove damages. On top of that, authenticity of the documents was not proven. The correctness of the statements in the documents has also to be proven.

> 150    (_counsel for plaintiffs_) … contends that JSL and JHL need not call the maker of the documents under s 32(_b_) and the documents are to be accepted on their face value. Section 32(_b_) does not assist JSL and JHL. First, there is a distinction in concepts between authenticity of documents, relevance and the procedure for proving contents of documents and admissibility under the exception to the hearsay rule. Second, evidence of authenticity is lacking. Authentication of documents is to be distinguished from and has to be resolved before relevance and admissibility under the exception to the hearsay rule. The matters stated in the documents (whether originals or photocopies) must be proved as explained in \[147\]. That was not done. Third, the requirements of s 32 must also be satisfied. (_counsel for plaintiffs_) in closing submissions simply alleged that the attendance of witnesses could not be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the court to be unreasonable. A bald allegation in closing submissions is not evidence and will not suffice. There must at least be some evidence to establish the conditions in s 32: see _Central Bank of India v Bansal Hemant Govindprasad_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 22</span>; _Sim & Associates v Tan Alfred_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 146</span> at \[65\].

> 151    For these reasons, secondary evidence of contents of documents relied upon by JSL and JHL has in my judgment clearly not been admitted. I am obliged to and do reject the documents tendered as the “Damages Bundle”.

52     The Plaintiff’s situation before me appeared to be on all-fours with that of the plaintiffs in _Jet Holding (HC)._ Only a photocopy of the Mazda Invoice appeared in the Plaintiff’s AEIC as an exhibit. The Defendant had objected to the document’s inclusion in the agreed bundle, and it was compiled separately in the Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents. In the face of the Defendant’s objections (which it was fully entitled to make) the Plaintiff had failed to satisfy the statutory requirements of the EA, and similar to the High Court in _Jet Holding (HC)_, I am obliged to reject the Mazda Invoice. The evidence therein pertaining to the tampering of the odometer is accordingly not admissible.

53     Counsel for the Plaintiff had sought to rely on excerpts from the Court of Appeal judgment in _Jet Holding Ltd & Ors v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 3 SLR(R) 769</span> (“_Jet Holding (CA)”_) pertaining to the erosion of the “best evidence rule” to support his contention that the modern approach which accomplishes the objectives of the EA without its undesirable practical effects, namely, to admit all evidence and then determine the weight to be accorded, should be applied to his case. While the Court of Appeal in _Jet Holding (CA)_ had expressed concern that judicial time may be wasted by a “punctilious insistence” on compliance with the EA provisions, it should be noted that these observations by the Court of Appeal were _obiter dicta_, see in particular \[66\]. The Court of Appeal had in fact gone on to emphasise that even if the more balanced or modern approach were to be applied, the High Court’s decision would still be affirmed on the issue of the admissibility of the Damages Bundle; see _Jet Holding (CA)_ \[67\].

54     In his further attempt to have the Mazda Invoice admitted, counsel for the Plaintiff then urged the Court to apply the exceptions to the hearsay rule in s 32 EA. This was similar to the approach taken by the plaintiffs in _Jet Holding_ where they had contended that the maker of the documents need not be called and the documents were to be accepted on their face value. As pointed out by the High Court in _Jet Holding (HC)_, authentication of documents is to be distinguished from, and has to be resolved _before_ considering relevance and admissibility under the exception to the hearsay rule. It seemed that the plaintiffs in _Jet Holding_ had failed to appreciate that evidence of authenticity of the documents was lacking, just as the Plaintiff before me.

55     The Plaintiff further contended that his case “falls squarely” within the Court of Appeal decision in _Gimpex Ltd_ v _Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 686</span> (“_Gimpex_”) where the Court of Appeal had allowed the admission of a survey report, the “Sucofindo Report” pursuant to s 32(1)(b)(iv) EA. I failed to see how the Plaintiff’s case was in any way similar to _Gimpex_ since authenticity of the Sucofindo Report was not in issue – the document was part of the agreed bundle (see _Gimpex Ltd_ v _Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 224</span> at \[204\]) and the Court was only concerned with the proof of its contents.

56     As highlighted earlier, the Defendant had objected to the Mazda Invoice on both authenticity and content. One obvious distinguishing feature in the Plaintiff’s case, unlike in _Gimpex_ where the Sucofindo Report had been put to the witness, is that the Mazda Invoice was not even adduced in evidence by PW-1. Hence, any discussion as to its contents would be out of place.

57     Further, if the Plaintiff had intended to rely on the hearsay evidence in the Mazda Invoice, he was required to give notice pursuant to O 38 r 4 of the Rules of Court, which he had failed to do.

#### Circumstantial evidence of admission from WhatsApp chat

58     The Plaintiff had also contended that the Whatsapp chat log exhibited in his AEIC served as incontrovertible circumstantial evidence for the purposes of proving that the odometer of the vehicle had in fact been tampered with. I was unable to accept this argument as I could not find any part of the conversation between the Plaintiff and the Defendant’s representative which evidenced an admission by the Defendant of the odometer having been tampered with.

59     Accordingly, I find that the Plaintiff has not proven that the odometer of the Vehicle was tampered with, thus rendering the mileage reading false.

## Conclusion

60     At the close of the Plaintiff’s case, he has failed to prove the essential facts of his claim in misrepresentation. Consequently, the Defendant’s submission of no case to answer succeeds. The Plaintiff’s claim is hereby dismissed. I will hear parties on costs.
