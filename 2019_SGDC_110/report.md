Tort – Negligence

Tort – Breach of Statutory Duty

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 16/2019.\]

27 May 2019

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants is for injuries suffered by the Plaintiff arising from an accident at a construction site, where the 2nd Defendant was the occupier of the site and the 1st Defendant was the Plaintiff’s employer. I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim. The Plaintiff has appealed against my decision.

## Facts

2       The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants is in negligence and breach of statutory duty, for injuries suffered by the Plaintiff arising from an accident on 21 October 2016, while the Plaintiff was carrying out work at a construction site at 26 Duke’s Road, 17 and 19 Queen’s Road known as the Asana (“the Worksite”). The Plaintiff was employed by the 1st Defendant. The 2nd Defendant was the occupier of the Worksite.

3       The Plaintiff claimed that while he was dismantling formwork with a crowbar that morning, the formwork fell and hit his right hand, causing a fracture to his thumb. The Plaintiff had been dismantling formwork for some time that morning, before the accident occurred.

4       The Plaintiff claimed that the accident occurred as a result of the Defendants’ negligence and breach of statutory duties under the Workplace Safety and Health Act, Workplace Safety and Health (Construction) Regulations 2007 and Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations 2007. Specifically, the Plaintiff alleged that the accident occurred because the Defendant failed to provide adequate supervision to enable the Plaintiff to carry out his work safely.

5       The Defendants’ position is that the Plaintiff was warned of the risk of formwork falling while dismantling, and was advised to safely dismantle the formwork by standing at the side of the formwork while dismantling.

## Decision

6       The Plaintiff accepted that he was a skilled carpentry worker, familiar with dismantling formwork and there was no need for the foreman to instruct the Plaintiff as to how the work is to be performed \[see paragraph 7 of the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) of the Plaintiff and Notes of Evidence (“NE”) at page 27\]. However, the Plaintiff claimed that the level of difficulty was high for that one particular formwork that he dismantled, as it was stuck onto the wall and he needed to use a lot of strength (see paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Plaintiff’s AEIC and NE27).

7       The Plaintiff stated that he was unable to position the platform closer to the formwork to be removed and that in any event, the position of the platform had no bearing on the issue of safety (see paragraph 10 of the Plaintiff’s AEIC). The Plaintiff claimed that while he was using the crowbar with more than the usual strength to ply off the formwork, the formwork snapped and fell onto his hand (see paragraph 11 of the Plaintiff’s AEIC).

8       It is unclear from the evidence, exactly how the formwork fell onto the Plaintiff’s hand. However, it would appear from the Plaintiff’s evidence that it was somehow due to the unusual level of difficulty in prying off this particular formwork, that caused the accident. The Plaintiff’s own evidence is that the dismantling of formwork had proceeded uneventfully (see paragraph 8 of the Plaintiff’s AEIC) and it was only the last portion that was unusual in requiring a significant use of strength to remove the formwork.

9       The Defendants could not be expected to continually supervise the Plaintiff in anticipation that there may be a particular formwork that would be more difficult to pry off. The difficulty experienced by the Plaintiff in removing this particular formwork, was described by the Plaintiff himself as unusual (see paragraph 9 of the Plaintiff’s AEIC).

10     In the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions (paragraph 24), it was submitted that “_It was the first time that the Plaintiff encountered such difficulty when removing the plywood formwork_”. The Plaintiff claimed in cross-examination that he told the foreman of his difficulty in removing this particular formwork and that the foreman then told him “_that if it’s not easy to do, then you \[go\] back home_” (see NE28). However, this claim by the Plaintiff was never raised in his Statement of Claim, nor his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. It was only raised for the first time in cross-examination. It is remarkable that such a material allegation was not mentioned by the Plaintiff in his Statement of Claim or his affidavit of evidence-in-chief.

11     Furthermore, when the Plaintiff was questioned on this earlier in cross-examination, his response was “_if_ _I tell the foreman, the foreman would just tell me, “Quickly do it”_” (NE28) (my emphasis underlined). The qualification “_if_”, suggests that he did not actually tell the foreman of his difficulty. It was only on further cross-examination, that the Plaintiff changed his answer to claim that he told the foreman. In the premises, I am unable to accept this allegation by the Plaintiff that there was such a conversation between him and the foreman.

12     In light of the aforesaid reasons, I am unable to accept the Plaintiff’s claims for breach of statutory duty and negligence against the Defendants. The Plaintiff’s claims are dismissed with costs.
