17 May 2019

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       This is an appeal by the accused, Mr Arunachalam Elayaraja, a 39-year old male Indian national against the global sentence of _12 weeks’ imprisonment_ imposed on him for three charges under section 6(b) read with section 29(a) Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev.Ed.). Initially, the amount of gratification reflected in the three original proceeded charges against him were as follows:

a)     $4000 to $5,000 for the fourth charge;

b)     $3000 to $5,000 for the fifth charge and

c)     $4000 to $5,000 for the sixth charge.

Although the parties were ready for the accused’s plea of guilt to be taken on 10 April 2019, I directed the Prosecution to consider specifying the exact amount of gratification provided to the agent in respect of each of the three proceeded charges as it would have an impact on sentencing. The case was adjourned to 6 May 2019 for the Prosecution to conduct further investigation into the exact amount of gratification that was provided to the agent for the proceeded charges.

2       Subsequently on 6 May 2019, the Prosecution tendered amended charges for the charges to be proceeded should the accused decide to plead guilty. The accused maintained his original plea and had pleaded guilty to the three following amended charges in **DAC 912574-2018, DAC 912575-2018** and **DAC 912576-2018** namely:

_Exhibit C1A –_ **_4th charge (Amended)_**

“…sometime between July and November 2014, in Singapore, did abet, by engaging in a conspiracy with one Murugesan Moorthy, to corruptly give to an agent, one Kolanji Govindan, a Site Manager in the employ of Singapore Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd (previously known as Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd (“SPCE”) ), gratification as an inducement for doing an act in relation to SPCE’s affairs, to wit, advancing the business interest of MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd with SPCE, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, to wit, sometime in September 2014, said Murugesan Moorthy gave a sum S$5000/- to the said Kolanji Govindan, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).”

_Exhibit C2A –_ **_5th charge (Amended)_**

“…sometime between July and November 2014, in Singapore, did abet, by engaging in a conspiracy with one Murugesan Moorthy, to corruptly give to an agent, one Kolanji Govindan, a Site Manager in the employ of Singapore Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd (previously known as Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd (“SPCE”) ), gratification as an inducement for doing an act in relation to SPCE’s affairs, to wit, advancing the business interest of MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd with SPCE, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, to wit, sometime in October 2014, said Murugesan Moorthy gave a sum S$5000/- to the said Kolanji Govindan, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).”

_Exhibit C3A –_ **_6th charge (Amended)_**

“…sometime between July and November 2014, in Singapore, did abet, by engaging in a conspiracy with one Murugesan Moorthy, to corruptly give to an agent, one Kolanji Govindan, a Site Manager in the employ of Singapore Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd (previously known as Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd (“SPCE”) ), gratification as an inducement for doing an act in relation to SPCE’s affairs, to wit, advancing the business interest of MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd with SPCE, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, to wit, sometime in November 2014, said Murugesan Moorthy gave a sum S$5000/- to the said Kolanji Govindan, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) read with Section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).”

Three other remaining charges against him, namely similar charges under s 6(b) read with s 29(a) Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev.Ed.) in **DAC 912571-2018, DAC 912572-2018** and **DAC 912573-2018** were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The charges in **DAC 912571-2018 9** (“1st charge”) and **DAC 912572-2018** (“2nd charge”) had each involved his abetment with one Murugesan Moorthy in giving gratification of $2,000 in July 2014 and August 2014 respectively, to the said agent Kolanji Govindan in order to advance the business interest of MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd with Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd. The third charge, **DAC 912573-2018** involved his abetment with Murugesan Moorthy in giving a loan of $1,000 in August 2014 to the said agent Kolanji Govindan in order to advance the business interest of MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd with Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd.

## B.   Statement of Facts

3       The Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) which the accused had admitted to without qualification is as follows:

1    The accused, **Arunachalam Elayaraja**, male Singapore Permanent Resident, was the director of MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd ("**MS Brothers**") from June 2013 to December 2014. The accused sold the business of MS Brothers in December 2014 and thereafter left the company.

2    MS Brothers is in the construction business and does scaffolding works for buildings. As the director of MS Brothers, the accused oversaw the business of the company. He was also the sole cheque signatory of MS Brothers’ bank account.

3    The accused worked closely with one Murugesan Moorthy (“**Moorthy**”), Operations Manager of MS Brothers. Moorthy was in charge of running the scaffolding operations and projects at work sites and reported directly to the accused. The accused and Moorthy would have weekly meetings to discuss the business of MS Brothers.

**_Facts pertaining to 4th, 5th and 6th Charges – DAC-912574-2018, DAC-912575-2018 and DAC-912576-2018_**

4    Sometime in June 2014, MS Brothers started receiving jobs from Singapore Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd (previously known as Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd) ("**SPCE**") for scaffolding works at the work site of Singapore University of Technology & Design. The accused knew Moorthy was the one who had secured these jobs from Kolanji Govindan ("**Kolanji**"), a Site Manager of SPCE.

5    Sometime in June 2014 when MS Brothers received the 1st progress payment from SPCE, the accused met Moorthy for their weekly meetings. In this meeting, Moorthy told the accused that he had asked Kolanji to recommend MS Brothers for scaffolding works of SPCE and in return he would give Kolanji monies. Moorthy sought for the accused’s permission to give such monies. The accused agreed to do so and told Moorthy that he can look for Mala, the accounts clerk in MS Brothers, to get the relevant cheque payments for such monies to be given to Kolanji.

6    Pursuant to this arrangement, Moorthy would go to Mala who would prepare the cheque payments. These cheques would be signed by the accused and the accused knew that the monies was to be paid Kolanji. Moorthy would take these cheques, encash them and then passed the monies to Kolanji on the following occasions:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.34%"> <col width="33.32%"> <col width="33.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Date</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-912574-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Sept 2014</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-912575-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Oct 2014</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-912576-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Nov 2014</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

7    On the above occasions, Moorthy gave the monies to Kolanji pursuant to his agreement with the accused to give monies to Kolanji in return for Kolanji recommending MS Brothers to SPCE for scaffolding works. By the foregoing, the accused has engaged in conspiracies with Moorthy to corruptly give gratifications to Kolanji as inducement for advancing the business interest of MS Brothers with SPCE and he has thereby committed offences under section 6(b) read with section 29 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

8    After November 2014, the accused sold the business of MS Brothers to one Visvalingam Pachamuthu and was therefore no longer involved in the giving of monies to Kolanji.

9    Between July and November 2014, the business volume between SPCE and Ms Brothers amounted to $1,033,570.25. During this period, the accused together with Moorthy had given Kolanji a total sum of $20,000.

## C.   Antecedents

4       The Accused has no prior antecedents.

## D.   Prosecution’s Address On Sentence

5       In its written skeletal address on sentence, the Prosecution sought a custodial term of 6 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment per proceeded charge and a total sentence of 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment.

6       It was submitted that it is trite that deterrence and punishment are the main sentencing consideration in corruption cases **(**see _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span> at \[33\]). In determining the appropriate sentence, the Prosecution highlighted the following considerations:

a.     The present case falls under the first category of cases enunciated in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span>. The accused paid bribes in order to get the respective receiver to favorably recommend MS Brothers for the jobs.

b.     There were four aggravating factors:

i.       The accused’s actions were premeditated: he agreed with Moorthy to give bribes to get business and had signed on the cheque payments in order for the bribes to be given out.

ii.       The accused, together with Moorthy, had initiated the giving of bribes.

iii.       There is a significant degree of persistent offending as the accused gave total of $20,000 bribes over 6 occasions from July to November 2014.

iv.       There was substantial benefit accruing as the accused’s company stood to gain $1 million in business.

7       The Prosecution had tendered a table of sentencing precedents of the following cases:

8       It was the case for the Prosecution that the precedents in the sentencing table showed that at least 6 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment are imposed where bribe amounts between $4,000 to $7,000 are given and 10 to 16 weeks’ imprisonment where the amounts ranged from $20,000 to $30,000.

9       It was submitted that having regard to the above aggravating factors that a sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment per charge ($5,000 per charge) and a total sentence of 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment ought to be imposed in the present case.

10     I then invited Counsel for the accused to make amendments to his written plea in mitigation that was filed on 9 April 2019 in light of the amended charges but he declined to do so.

## E.   Mitigation

## Background

11     In his written plea in mitigation, his Counsel had stated that the accused is an Indian national who obtained his Singapore Permanent Residency status in 2008. Since July 2007, he has been working as an Architectural Supervisor at Sato Kogyo (S) Pte. Ltd (“**Sato Kogyo**”).

12     According to his Counsel, sometime in early 2013, the accused was introduced by his friend, one Mr. Kumar, to Mr. Murugesan Moorthy (“**Moorthy**”). At the material time, Moorthy wanted to set up a company in Singapore dealing in the scaffolding business. However, as Moorthy was an Indian national with only an “S pass”, he required someone like the accused, who was a Singapore PR, to become the director of such a company.

13     It was submitted that pursuant to the discussion between Moorthy and the accused, it was agreed that: -

13.1.     Moorthy would solely contribute the sum of S$50,000 as share capital of the company;

13.2.     Moorthy and the accused would hold equal shares in the company;

13.3. Moorthy would “handle from top to bottom” all operations of the company for the first two years. This included all office and administrative matters, accounts, human resource matters as well as all site project matters; and

13.4.     The accused would become the director of the company and receive a monthly salary of S$2,000 per month.

14     On 10 June 2013, the accused and Moorthy incorporated MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd (“**MS Brothers**”), with the accused being the sole-director of MS Brothers. It was further submitted that at the material time, the accused was a full-time employee of Sato Kogyo and was resultantly not so involved in the running of MS Brothers.

15     According to his Counsel, Moorthy was effectively in charge of MS Brothers. As Project Manager of MS Brothers, Moorthy took charge of the day-to-day running of existing site projects whilst pursuing new project leads. He also worked closely with employees of MS Brothers, including Manikandan Mala (“**Mala**”), the Human Resources Manager.

16     It was submitted that although the accused and Moorthy were registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“**ACRA**”) as 50% shareholders of MS Brothers, Moorthy’s registration came under the scrutiny of the Ministry of Manpower (“**MOM**”) due to his “S Pass” status. To resolve this issue, Moorthy transferred his 50% shareholdings in MS Brothers to the accused in 2014.

17     It was further submitted that despite being a shareholder and director of MS Brothers from June 2013 to December 2014, the accused never received any dividends or director’s fees from MS Brothers. According to his Counsel, to the best of the accused’s knowledge, Moorthy was the only individual who kept the profits earned by MS Brothers.

18     It was submitted that being the sole director of MS Brothers, the accused was the only authorised signatory for MS Brothers’ current account facility with OCBC Bank (the “**OCBC Account**”). According to him, all of the monies in the OCBC Account belonged to Moorthy and the accused did not contribute to the OCBC Account at all.

#### (1)   Facts relating to the charges

19     According to his Counsel, sometime in June 2014, MS Brothers started receiving jobs from Singapore Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd (previously known as Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Ptd Ltd (“**SPCE**”)) for scaffolding works at the work site of Singapore University of Technology & Design. Moorthy was the one who had secured these jobs from one Kolanji Govindan (“**Kolanji**”).

20     Thereafter, during a meeting with Moorthy, Moorthy told the accused that he had asked Kolanji to recommend MS Brothers for scaffolding works of SPCE and in return, he would give Kolanji monies. Moorthy then sought for the accused’s permission to give such monies. It was the case for the Defence that as Moorthy was effectively in charge of MS Brothers, the accused acquiesced to Moorthy’s suggestion.

21     It was submitted that pursuant to this, Moorthy would go to Mala who would prepare the cheque payments. Mala would in turn approach the accused to obtain the necessary signatories for the said cheques. Thereafter, Moorthy would take these cheques, encash them and then pass the monies to Kolanji on the following occasions: -

21.1.     September 2014 – S$4,000 to S$5,000

21.2.     October 2014 – S$4,000 to S$5,000

21.3.     November 2014 – S$4,000 to S$5,000

22     It was further submitted that accordingly, the three (3) cheques amounting to the total sum of $10,000/- to $15,000/- form the subject matter of the Charges.

## Section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act

#### Sentencing Principles for Three Categories of Private Sector Corruption

23     It was submitted that in _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (“**_Mostofa Romel_**”), the High Court had set out at \[26\] three broad and non-exhaustive categories of private sector corruption:

23.1.     First, where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest; (the “**First Category**”);

23.2.     Second, where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This also is typically done at the payer’s behest; (the “**Second Category**”)

23.3.     Third, where a receiving party is paid so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. This is typically done at the receiving party’s behest; (the “**Third Category**”)

24     It was further submitted that an example of a case falling within the First Category is where the receiving party purchases or favourably recommends the goods or services offered by the paying party (_Mostofa Romel_ at \[27\]). Whether the custodial threshold is crossed depends on the facts (_Mostofa Romel_ at \[27\]). An example of a case falling within the Second Category is where the receiving party, who is under a duty to inspect the paying party’s goods or work, slackens in his inspection or turns a blind eye to any deficiencies in the paying party’s goods or work (_Mostofa Romel_ at \[28\]). These cases frequently attract custodial sentences (_Mostofa Romel_ at \[28\]). It was highlighted that the Third Category generally attracts a custodial sentence due to the receiving party’s heightened culpability in: - (a) seeking out payment from the paying party, whether implicitly or explicitly; and (b) in his threat, if the bribe is not paid, to inflict harm on the paying party when there is no lawful basis for doing so (_Mostofa Romel_ at \[29\]).

25     It was the case for the defence that the three categories are meant only as “analytical tools”, are not “watertight” and are “not intended to be determinative of any case” (_Mostofa Romel_ at \[31\]). Instead, sentencing remains an “intensely factual exercise” and the court must “correctly locate the facts of the case, including the circumstances of the offender that is before it within the continuum of the facts in previously decided cases before coming to a conclusion as to the appropriate sentence” (_Mostofa Romel_ at \[31\]).

#### Relevant Factors for Sentencing

26     It was submitted that in _Chua Tiong Tiong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 515</span> _(“_**_Chua Tiong Tiong_**_”)_, Yong Pung How CJ expounded at \[21\] that: -

“\[…\] I endorsed the general principle that in most cases, the giver of gratification bears equal culpability as to that of the receiver. Sentences meted out should therefore be similar in terms. \[…\]”

It was further submitted that this position was similarly echoed in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 134</span> _(“_**_Ang Seng Thor_**_”)_, at \[45\] and _Public Prosecutor v Tee Fook Boon Andrew_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 192</span> _(“_**_Andrew Tee_**_”)_ at \[20\].

27     It was further submitted the non-exhaustive factors that are relevant in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence under s 6 of the PCA are:

27.1.     whether the offence was committed by a public servant;

27.2.     what the value of the gratification was;

27.3.     whether the offender was in a position of trust;

27.4.     the number of offences committed;

27.5. whether the offence was committed over a lengthy period; and

27.6.     the seriousness of the consequence of the offender’s acts.

(see _Practitioners’ Library: Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Court_ vol 2 (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate_ Court”) at pg 1378).

#### Whether the Custodial Threshold is Crossed

28     It was submitted the following remarks by the High Court in _Mostofa Romel_ at \[20\] are instructive as to whether the custodial threshold is crossed:

“Where private sector agents are concerned, offences which register a lower level of culpability _can_ be dealt with by the imposition of fines. Such cases are _generally_ those where the **amount of gratification is below $30,000** and where there is **no real detriment to the interests of the principal** …” \[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold and underline\]

29     It was highlighted that in _Heng Tze Yong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 976</span> (“**_Heng Tze Yong_**”), it was emphasised at \[25\] that the amount of gratification is an important factor:

“The amount of gratification involved remains an important factor in determining the proper sentence for corruption offences. The reasons for regarding this factor as important, which are summarised in the passage above, remained relevant: the amount of gratification still correlates with the harm caused by the bribe and the need to deter the creation of a corrupt business culture at the highest level of commerce. Additionally, there is nothing in _Mostofa Romel_ (\[19\] supra) to suggest that the amount of gratification is no longer an important factor. … ”

30     It was submitted where private sector corruption involves (a) a significant amount of gratification; (b) gratification which is received over a lengthy period of time; or (c) a compromise of one’s duty or a serious betrayal of trust, the starting point is likely to be a custodial sentence (_Mostofa Romel_ at \[23\]).

#### (2)   Sentencing Precedents

31     It was the case for the defence that a fine is typically given in cases involving small amounts of gratification and/or number of charges. In _Heng Tze Yong_, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 6(b) of the PCA involving the **sum of $3,000**. The accused was a director of a company that provided semiconductor engineering services, including parts cleaning services and supplying high efficiency particulate (“**HEPA**”) air filters. He was introduced to one Ben Ong, a facility manager at a semiconductor company called Micron. At Ben Ong’s request, the accused paid him sums of $3,000 (subject of the proceeded charge) and $7,000, to avoid souring their relationship and to secure continued business form Micron. The High Court ultimately found that the gratification was substantially under S$30,000 and there was no real detriment to Micron (at \[22\]). Accordingly, the High Court reduced his sentence to **a fine of S$35,000.**

32     In the related case of _Public Prosecutor v Thor Chi Tiong_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 167</span> (“**_Thor DC_**”), the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of corruptly giving a **gratification of $10,000** to Ben Ong through Benny How, a Director in the employ of Infinity Power Engineering Pte Ltd, as a reward for doing an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, _to wit_, assisting Infinity to secure business from Micron. The accused was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment and subsequently appealed against the sentence imposed. The decision in _Thor DC_ was ultimately reversed by the High Court on appeal in Magistrate’s Appeal No 9123 of 2016 (“**_Thor HC_**”), where Sundaresh Menon CJ set aside Thor’s term of imprisonment and substituted it with **a fine of S$35,000** (see _Heng Tze Yong_ at \[16\]).

33     In _Public Prosecutor v Tom Goh Lye Tiong_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 337</span> (“**_Tom Goh Lye Tiong_**_”)_, the accused had claimed trial to a charge under s 6(b) PCA of corruptly giving a **gratification of $1,000** as an inducement and was **fined $5,000 after a full trial**. The accused was a sole director of BSP Engineering Pte Ltd (“**BSP**”). The recipient was an agent of Glaxo Wellcome Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“**Glaxo**”) and he was working in the department, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (“**GSKB**”). The recipient’s duties included, _inter alia_, obtaining quotations for stainless steel fabrications required for his department. The accused had given the recipient a gratification of $1,000/- as an inducement for assisting BSP in advancing its business interest with GSKB in terms of inviting BSP for quotes and helping BSP in securing repeat orders.

34     In _Public Prosecutor v Aw Keem Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 39</span>, the accused pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, three charges under s 6(b) PCA and had fifteen (15) charges under s 6(b) PCA taken into consideration. The accused was a Senior Vice President of Jardine Logistics (Singapore) Pte Ltd while the recipient was Assistant General Manager of RTW Air Services. The accused had on two occasions given gratification of $4,000 and $1,400 in 2001 and 2002 respectively. Further, the accused had on another occasion given gratification of $2,000 to another recipient, who was the Traffic Supervisor of the Traffic Department of Cooper Cameron. The accused was fined $10,000, $4,000 and $5,000 respectively.

#### (3)   Prosecution’s Sentencing Precedents

35     It was submitted that in _Public Prosecutor v Ong Seng Wee_, notwithstanding the fact that the quantum of the total bribe involved amounts to merely $20,000 (which is below the quantum of $30,000 highlighted in _Mostofa Romel_), it is pertinent to note from the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) that the accused was the initiator of bribe in relation to the 2nd charge, wherein the accused had “_\[a\]sked Heng for $7,000 as bribe \[…\]”_. It was further submitted that the imprisonment terms of the givers of the bribes in relation to the 2nd and 3rd charge were respectively set aside and substituted with a fine of $35,000 upon appeal (see \[32\] and \[33\] above).

36     It was submitted that in _Public Prosecutor v Koh Kian Wee (“_**_Koh Kian Wee_**_”)_, the accused faced a total of 50 PCA charges, of which 11 related to corruptly accepting gratification under section 6(a) of the PCA. These offences were committed over the duration of about a year. Further, the total quantum of the bribes in relation to the PCA charges amounted to $54,800. It was further submitted that even if the to focus is only on the section 6(a) PCA charges, the total quantum there amounted to $37,150 – which is higher than the recommended threshold expounded in _Mostofa Romel_.

37     It was the case for the defence that the element of dishonesty is starkly present in _Koh Kian Wee_. At paragraph 4 of the SOF, it is apparent that the accused and the co-accused had conspired to exploit the ‘Kurita’ by “_\[submitting\] marked-up quotes, which the Accused would accept and award the job to Global”._ This element of dishonesty, couple with the fact that steps were taken to conceal the corrupt scheme starkly differs from the factual matrix of the present case. It was submitted that the case of _Koh Kian Wee_ should be given little weight.

38     Lastly, it was highlighted that in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Geow Chwee Hiam_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 139</span> (“**_Geow Chwee Hiam_**”), the accused, a director of a public listed company had pleaded guilty to three (3) charges under s 6(a) PCA for corruptly accepting gratification and consented to having five (5) other similar charges taken into consideration. It was submitted that the total quantum involved in the three proceeded charges amounted to $80,000 and that the grand total amount in relation to the corrupt scheme is $143,000. This is vastly higher than the recommended threshold of $30,000 highlighted in _Mostofa Romel_. In addition, it was further submitted that the following aggravating factors present in _Geow Chwee Hiam_ are devoid in the present case: -

38.1     Multiple offences over a significantly long period of two years;

38.2     Substantial financial gain to the accused;

38.3     Offences were premeditated and steps were taken to conceal them;

38.4     The accused had initiated the bribe;

38.5     The bribe amounts were substantial ranging between $10,000 to $30,000.

## A fine is appropriate in light of the mitigating factors

39     The present case falls under the **First Category** set out in _Mostofa Romel_. It was submitted that a fine was appropriate in light of the mitigating factors and that the custodial threshold has not been crossed.

40     It was submitted that the present case involved a small amount of gratification. The quantum involved under the proceeded charge is within the range of ‘_$11,000 – $15,000’._ Even if the quantum of the proceeded charge is taken at the highest, it was submitted that this is less than the quantum of $30,000, highlighted in _Mostofa Romel_ and _Heng Tze Yong_ which correlates with a lower level of culpability (_Heng Tze Yong_ at \[21\] and \[25\]). Accordingly, the present case could appropriately be dealt with by imposing a fine.

41     It was submitted that the accused was not the initiator of the bribes and merely acquiesced to Moorthy’s suggestion to bribe Kolanji, as inducement for advancing the business interest of MS Brothers with SPCE. Further, according to his Counsel the accused played a peripheral role in signing the cheques and did not play an active role in the scheme of things (see \[17\] and \[18\] above). It was further submitted that the accused’s position within MS Brothers was in essence that of a figurehead.

42     It was submitted that in stark contrast, Moorthy was in reality the directing mind and will of MS Brothers, handling of the day-to-day management of the company. Moorthy was also the initiator of the bribe and played an active role in the corrupt scheme.

43     It was further submitted that the accused did not benefit personally from the bribes and/or the increase in business volume between SPCE and MS Brothers. Save for his salary of S$2,000, which was agreed prior to the incorporation of MS Brothers, the accused did not obtain any financial benefit at all material times.

44     It was the case for the defence that the offences were committed over a short span of 5 months and were limited to the six instances. It was submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that but for the bribes, SPCE would not have increased their business dealings with MS Brothers. It was highlighted that it was apparent from SOF that there was a pre-existing relationship between SPCE and MS Brothers prior to the corrupt scheme. Paragraph 4 of the SOF states, “_\[…\] MS Brothers started receiving job_**_s_** _\[…\]”_. The use of a plural noun denotes that MS Brothers was already engaging in various business dealings with SPCE prior to the corrupt scheme.

45     It was submitted that as far as the accused was aware, the contracts that were awarded by SPCE were successfully managed and completed by MS Brothers without any hiccups. It was further submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that cheaper alternatives were not sought by SPCE and that MS Brothers’ quotation were significantly higher than the market rate. It was the case for the defence that there was no evidence to suggest that there was a real detriment to SPCE as a result of the accused’s actions.

46     It was submitted that this was the accused’s first brush with the law. He was remorseful for his actions and had elected to plead guilty to the proceeded charge at an early stage. It was highlighted in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ \[2006\] 4 SLR (R) 653 at \[77\], then Honourable Justice VK Rajah held that:

“A plea of guilt can be taken into consideration when it is motivated by genuine remorse, contriteness or regret and/or a desire to facilitate the administration of justice.”

47     It was further submitted that his plea of guilt was motivated by genuine remorse and contrition. He had, to the best of his ability, provided his full cooperation to CPIB throughout the course of their investigations. Through this incident, he had learnt his lesson and vows to stay on the straight and narrow hereon forth. Therefore, it was submitted that significant mitigating weight should be accorded to his decision to plead guilty to the proceeded charge.

#### Quantum of Fine

48     It was submitted that in determining the appropriate quantum of fine to be imposed, the case of _Heng Tze Yong_ expounded at \[46\] – \[47\] that: -

“\[46\] As I viewed it, the Appellant’s culpability was broadly similar to that of Thor, bearing in mind the following similarities:

(a)    The total amount of gratification was S$10,000 (though it should be noted that the amount involved in the proceeded charge was only S$7,000)

(b)    The bribes were paid to the same recipient, ie, Ben Ong;

(c)    No detriment was suffered by the principal, ie, Micron was the principal in both cases; and

(d)    The offenders in both cases held senior positions in their respective companies, ie, ANM and Infinity

\[47\]  There were some differences between the two cases. For example, the Appellant had committed two offences (compared to Thor’s single offence), while Thor had initiated his offence and the Appellant had not.

On the whole, in my judgement, both the Appellant and Thor were of similar culpability. Accordingly, it was appropriate to impose on the Appellant the same fine of S$35,000 that was imposed on Thor.

49     It was further submitted that a fine not exceeding S$40,000 would be appropriate in light of the mitigating factors. First, the amount of gratification in respect of the proceeded charge is ‘$11,000 to $15,000’, which is significantly lower than the quantum of $30,000 highlighted in _Mostofa Romel_. This correlates with a lower level of culpability. Second, there was no evidence to suggest that the principal had suffered real detriment (see \[47\] and \[48\] above). Third, it is undisputed that the accused did not benefit personally from the corrupt scheme. Last but not least, the accused had elected to plead guilty at an early stage. In the circumstances, a fine similar in quantum to that imposed in _Heng Tze Yong_ would be appropriate. His Counsel urged the Court to impose a global fine not exceeding S$40,000 in respect of the present case. He orally submitted that for the proceeded charges the amount of gratification sums up to “$20,000”. Even if the charges that were taken into consideration were taken into account, it amounts to “$25,000” which was still below the threshold in _Heng Tze Yong._

50     His Counsel further orally submitted that if the Court is minded to take the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed, a sentence of 4 to 6 weeks’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive. He urged the Court to impose a sentence of one week’s imprisonment per charge and a global sentence of two weeks’ imprisonement. In support of his submissions, his Counsel referred to _PP v Tan Kok Wah_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 93</span> (“**Tan Kok Wah**”).

51     It was further submitted that based on the scale set where there is global gratification of $20,000 or at least where there is $5,000 per charge, each charge should carry one week’s imprisonment whereas in the case of $10,000 it should carry a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment. It was highlighted that _Tan Kok Wah_ is a much more serious case where the total amount involved was $134,000 and 21 charges were taken into consideration. It was also a relatively recent case.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

52     In response to the plea in mitigation, the Prosecution highlighted several factors. The first factor that distinguished the case of _Heng Tze Yong_ is the number of offences i.e. six offences over a period of five months for the present case. It was submitted that it was significantly more persistent than what _Heng Tze Yong_ did. It was further submitted that it was more aggravated as there were far more occasions where the bribes were given to the receiver.

53     Secondly, it was highlighted that the Defence Counsel had characterized the accused as someone who was simply compliant in this transaction and he was not the initiator. It was submitted that it was nothing from the truth because the facts show that he was the director of the company, he was the sole signatory for the cheques and for all intents and purposes without his cooperation these offences could not have been committed. It was further submitted that the facts clearly show that the accused was part of the transaction where both of them initiated the bribe whereas in _Heng Tze Yong_, he was not the initiator.

54     It was submitted that the final factor was that the benefit that was derived from the bribe - the benefit to the company was over a million dollar. The contract in _Heng Tze Yong_ was $67,000. It was the case for the Prosecution that there was clearly a large gulf in the benefit that was derived in both cases. Given these distinguishing factors, it was further submitted that a custodial sentence was warranted and a global sentence of 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

## G.   The Sentences

#### Section 6(b) Prevention of Corruption Act

55     The prescribed punishment for an offence of corruptly giving gratification to an agent under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both a fine and a term of imprisonment.

56     The accused had been charged with _six counts_ of this offence and was convicted on _three charges_ of abetting by engaging in a conspiracy with one Murugesan Moorthy, to corruptly give gratification to one Kolanji Govindan, a site manager in the employ of Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd in order to advance the business interest of Ms Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd. Essentially, it was undisputed that between July 2014 and November 2014, the accused, a director of MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd together with Murugesan Moorthy, had given Kolanji a total sum of _$20,000_ as gratification for recommending the accused’s company for scaffolding works. During the same period, the business volume between SPCE and Ms Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd had amounted to _$1,033,570.25_.

57     In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of 6 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment per proceeded charge and a total sentence of 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment. In contrast, Counsel for the accused had sought a global fine of $40,000 in respect of the three proceeded charges. In the alternative, if the Court was minded to take the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed, he had submitted for a sentence of one week’s imprisonment per charge and a global sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment.

#### Sentencing considerations

58     The present case is one involving private sector corruption. Based on the factual matrix of the present case, it fell under the first category of private sector corruption as set out by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (“**_Mostofa Romel_**”) at \[26\]. This was an instance where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. In the present case, the benefit that was within the site manager’s power to confer was to advance the business interest of MS Brothers Scaffolding & Engineering Pte Ltd with Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd through recommending scaffolding works to the former.

59     I then had to determine whether the proceeded charges warranted the imposition of a high fine or whether the custodial threshold had been crossed. To do so, I had considered the various sentencing precedents for offences under section 6 Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev.Ed.) that were placed before me by both the Prosecution and the Defence as set out above for guidance. I was also mindful for the unreported decisions that were cited, as there were no grounds of decision, they lacked precedential value as compared to the reported decisions. Nevertheless, they did shed some light on the general sentencing trend for similar cases.

60     In my determination of the appropriate sentence, I was mindful that where private sector agents are concerned, offences involving a lower level of culpability can be dealt with by the imposition of a fine: _see Mostafa Romel_ at \[20\]. Further, in the same case at \[23\], the High Court noted that in Singapore where private sector corruption involves (a) a significant amount of gratification; (b) gratification which is received over a lengthy period of time; or (c) a compromise of one’s duty or a serious betrayal of trust, the starting point is likely to be a custodial sentence.

61     In addition, I was mindful that whether a custodial sentence is warranted in a particular case is ultimately determined upon a careful consideration of sentencing principles such as the public interest and other policy considerations, as well as the gravity of the offence including the particular facts and circumstances thereof: _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span>.

#### Aggravating factors

62     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the custodial threshold had been crossed in view of the aggravating factors namely:

i.     The accused’s actions were premeditated as he had agreed with Moorthy to give bribes to get business and had signed on the cheque payments in order for the bribes to be given out.

ii.     The accused, together with Moorthy, had initiated the giving of bribes.

iii.     There was a significant degree of persistent offending as the accused gave total of $20,000 bribes on 6 occasions over a period of 5 months i.e. from July 2014 to November 2014.

iv.     There was substantial benefit accruing as the accused’s company stood to gain $1 million in business.

63     I disagreed with Counsel’s assertion that the accused had merely acquiesced to Moorthy’s suggestion to bribe Kolanji. I did not accept Counsel’s submissions that the accused only played a peripheral role in signing the cheques and did not play an active role in the scheme of things. Instead, I agreed with the Prosecution that as the accused was the sole director of the company at the material time as well as the sole signatory for the cheques, without his cooperation these offences could not have been committed. In my mind the accused played an active role in the conspiracy with Moorthy to corruptly influence the site manager of Singapore Piling & Civil Engineering Pte Ltd who was in a position to recommend the accused’s company for the scaffolding works.

64     In addition, I disagreed with Counsel’s submissions that that the present case involved a small amount of gratification. In my mind, taken in its proper context a sum of $20,000 over a short period of five months is not an insignificant amount. I also noted that the giving of the monies stopped after November 2014 when the accused sold off the the business of MS Brothers to one Visvalingam Pachamuthu who was no longer involved in the giving of monies to Kolanji. Based on the above factors, it could not be said that the accused had a lower level of culpability which could be dealt with by the imposition of a fine.

65     In addition, I agreed with the Prosecution that the case of _Heng Tze Yong_ can be distinguished from the present case. I noted that the accused there had pleaded guilty to one charge under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act where the sum of gratification involved was $7,000. Another similar charge involving the sum of $3,000 was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The value of the contracts awarded in _Heng Tze Yong_ was much lower than the present case and he was not the initiator of the gratification. Although he was initially sentenced to five weeks’ imprisonment, on appeal the sentence was reduced to a fine of $35,000 for the single proceeded charge. In contrast, Counsel for the accused is seeking a global fine of $40,000 for three proceeded charges under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

66     In the present case while it has been said that this was his first brush with the law, the accused cannot be said to be a first offender: _see Mostafa Romel_ at \[47\]. The offences he had been charged with relate to six separate offences over a period of five months. I agreed with the Prosecution that this reflected a degree of persistent offending. Hence, it would be more accurate to describe him as someone with no prior antecedents rather than a first offender.

67     In addition, his Counsel had submitted that significant mitigating weight should be accorded to his decision to plead guilty to the proceeded charges at an early stage. In fact, his case was first mentioned _4 April 2018_ and it was only in _January 2019_ that the accused had first indicated his intention to plead guilty. Hence, it would be incorrect to state that he had pleaded guilty at an early stage. Thus, it would not be appropriate to accord significant mitigating weight to his plea of guilt. Hence, he would not be entitled to the same discount in sentence accorded to a person who had elected to plead guilty at the first available opportunity.

68     I next considered the appropriate length of the imprisonment term to be imposed. The Prosecution had sought sentences of 6 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment per charge whereas in his alternative submissions, Counsel for the accused had sought one week’s imprisonment for each charge. Counsel had relied on _PP v Tan Kok Wah_ and had urged the Court to impose a sentence of one week’s imprisonment per charge and a global sentence of two weeks’ imprisonement. Nevertheless, I noted that on appeal, the sentences of two weeks’ imprisonment had been enhanced to three weeks’ imprisonment. His global sentence was enhanced by the High Court from 9 weeks’ imprisonment to 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

69     After a careful consideration of the above factors, in view of the dominant sentencing principle of general deterrence, the aggravating factors highlighted above, as well as the mitigating factors, I was of the view that a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment for each of the proceeded charges in **DAC 912574-2018, DAC 912575-2018** and **DAC 912576-2018** would be just and appropriate in the present case. I ordered the sentences for **DAC 912574-2018** and **DAC 912576-2018** to run consecutively pursuant to s 307(1) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.) which provides that if a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the sentences for at least two of those offences are to run consecutively. His total imprisonment term was 12 weeks’ imprisonement.

#### Co-accused’s sentences

70     His co-accused Murugesan Moorthy had also pleaded guilty before me on 6 May 2019. He faced 8 charges under section 6(b) Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev.Ed.). The Prosecution had proceeded on three charges and had the remaining five charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing as reflected in the table below.

He was sentenced to _8 weeks’ imprisonment_ per charge for **DAC 913246-2018** and **DAC 913248-2018** and _6 weeks’ imprisonment_ for **DAC 913250-2018**. I ordered the charges in DAC 913246-2018 and DAC 913250-2018 to run consecutively. His total sentence was 14 weeks’ imprisonment. I was of the view that his sentences warranted an uplift from that of the accused as he had faced two additional charges, there were two receivers involved and he was the one who had approached the receivers. He is presently serving his imprisonment term.

71     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against his sentences on 6 May 2019. The Accused is currently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.
