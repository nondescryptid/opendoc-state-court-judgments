Tort – Negligence – Whether defence of volenti non fit injuria precluded by section 5 of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party) Risks and Compensation Act 1960

Tort – Negligence – Contributory negligence of a passenger who takes a lift from a drunk driver

3 October 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Ng Tee Tze Allen:

1       This action follows a motor accident that took place in the early morning of 2 September 2019. The plaintiff was the passenger of the car in question, and the defendant its driver. It was common ground that both of them had been drinking the night before and were both drunk.

2       The defendant does not dispute that he owed the plaintiff a duty of care that was breached. In fact, he accepted when cross examined that he was at fault for the accident.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) There was also no question that the plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the accident.

3       Notwithstanding, the defendant disputed liability. He sought to rely on the defences of _volenti non fit injuria_ and contributory negligence.

4       Having heard the trial on liability and considered the parties’ submissions, I dismiss the defence of _volenti non fit injuria_, but allow the defence of contributory negligence to the extent of 25%. Accordingly, I give interlocutory judgment to the plaintiff for 75%.

5       These are the grounds of my decision.

## Facts

6       The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise stated.

7       The plaintiff worked at Club De Zara at the material time. As part of her job, she served drinks and entertained customers.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

8       The defendant visited Club De Zara on 1 September 2020 with his friends. They had a private room where they drank from about 10:00 pm that night to about 2:00 am the next morning.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

9       There was some dispute as to how long the plaintiff was in the private room. The plaintiff claimed that she was working in other rooms and would only “pop by” from time to time because her colleague, Ms Cao Yiran, was in there.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) By contrast, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff “was the hostess serving \[them\] drinks and \[they\] had about 3 towers of Tiger Beer in a span of four hours.”[^5] I will return to this point at \[40\] below. For now, it suffices to note that the plaintiff was in the defendant’s room at various points that evening.[^6]

10     The night did not end at Club De Zara. The parties left at about 2:00am and headed to a second night club, Club Gaga, where they continued drinking until about 5:00 am.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

11     There was, again, some dispute as to how much the plaintiff interacted with the defendant at Club Gaga. The plaintiff claimed that she was predominantly with her own group,[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) whereas the defendant said that she joined his group.[^9] Little turned on this. There was little doubt that the plaintiff joined the defendant’s group from time to time at Club Gaga. Ms Cao also testified that the plaintiff would have seen the defendant’s group drinking.[^10]

12     The plaintiff, Ms Cao, the defendant and his friends left Club Gaga at around 5:00am. The initial plan was for them to take taxis home with the plaintiff and the defendant sharing a taxi.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) However, after Ms Cao and the defendant’s friends left, the defendant attempted to drive the plaintiff home.

13     The plaintiff and the defendant met with a motor accident on the way home along the Central Expressway. The plaintiff sustained injuries and sued the defendant.

## Issues

14     The defendant did not dispute that he was negligent. However, he disputed liability arguing that the plaintiff took a lift from him even though she knew that he was drunk.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) On this basis, the defendant sought to rely on 2 defences:

> (a)     First, the defendant submitted that the defence of _volenti non fit injuria_ applied such that he should be completely absolved of liability.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

> (b)     Second, the defendant submitted that the defence of contributory negligence applied such that his liability would be reduced to the extent that the plaintiff failed to take reasonable care for her own safety. In his respect, the defendant also asserted that the plaintiff failed to use her safety belt and that she distracted him when he was driving.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

15     I consider each defence in turn.

## The defence of _volenti non fit injuria_

16     I start with the defence of _volenti non fit injuria_. This defence is premised on a claimant’s consent to the risk of harm. In the context of a negligence claim, the defendant has to prove that the claimant had: (1) acted freely and voluntarily, (2) acted with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk of harm created by the defendant’s negligence, and (3) expressly or impliedly consented to the above risk: Gary Chan Kok Yew, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“**The Law of Torts in Singapore**”) at \[08.024\].

17     The plaintiff submitted that the defence could not apply in the present case because section 5 of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party) Risks and Compensation Act 1960 (the “**Act**”) precluded its application.

18     I agree with the plaintiff for the reasons that follow.

### Whether section 5 of the Act can preclude the defence of volenti non fit injuria

19     First, it is clear from the wording of section 5 that it can preclude the defence of _volenti non fit injuria_. As noted, the defence is premised on a claimant’s consent to risk of harm caused by the defendant’s negligence. However, section 5(2), if triggered, prevents a passenger’s willing acceptance of risk of negligence by a driver from negativing liability:

> Exclusion of liability in respect of passengers to be of no effect

> 5.—(1)    Where a person uses a motor vehicle in circumstances such that under section 3 there is required to be in force in relation to the person’s use of it a policy of insurance or security that is mentioned in section 3(1), then, if any other person is carried in or upon the motor vehicle while the user is so using it, any antecedent agreement or understanding between them (whether intended to be legally binding or not) is of no effect so far as it purports or might be held —

>> (a)    to negative or restrict any such liability of the user in respect of persons carried in or upon the motor vehicle as is required by section 4 to be covered by a policy of insurance; or

>> (b)    to impose any conditions with respect to the enforcement of any such liability of the user.

> (2)     **The fact that a person so carried as referred to in subsection (1) has willingly accepted as the person’s the risk of negligence on the part of the user is not to be treated as negativing any such liability of the user**.

> (3)    For the purposes of this section, references to a person being carried in or upon a motor vehicle include references to a person entering or getting on to, or alighting from, the motor vehicle, and the reference to an antecedent agreement is to one made at any time before the liability arose.

> (emphasis mine)

20     This was how the court in _Rashid Osman bin Abdul Razak v Abdul Muhaimin bin Khairuddin_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 762</span> (“**_Rashid_**”) interpreted section 5. In _Rashid_, a pillion passenger of a motorcycle sued the motorcyclist for negligence. It transpired that the motorcyclist had stolen the motorcycle from his acquaintance and did not have a valid motorcycle license. The insurer of the stolen motorcycle was joined as a co-defendant. It submitted that the defence of _violenti non fit injuria_ applied on the basis that the passenger knew the motorcyclist did not have a valid license. The court rejected the defence because the evidence did not establish that the passenger knew that the motorcyclist did not have a valid licence (_Rashid_ at \[29\]). However, the court also held that section 5 would have precluded the defence even if the passenger had the requisite knowledge (_Rashid_ at \[30\]-\[32\]). In particular, the court stated at \[32\]:

> 32    I would not have been inclined to accept Mr Appoo’s argument that s 5 of the Act is inapplicable. The Act does not state that there must be an effective policy of insurance at the time of the accident in order for s 5 to apply. The section explicitly states that it is triggered when a motor vehicle is used in circumstances such that there is required under the Act to be in force a policy of insurance. **Hence, s 5 should be applicable in the circumstances of the present case, where the Defendant used a motor vehicle (ie, the motorcycle) which would require a policy of insurance under the Act. The effect of s 5 is that the defence of volenti non fit injuria would not have been available to the Co-Defendant.**

> (emphasis mine)

21     The defendant sought to restrict _Rashid_ to situations where insurers were raising the defence.

22     I was not convinced. In coming to its decision, the court referred to _Pitts v Hunt_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 QB 24</span> where Beldam LJ had opined that the corresponding English statutory provisions “clearly mean that **it is no longer open to the driver of a motor vehicle** to say that the fact of his passenger … willingly accepted a risk of negligence on the driver’s part, relieves him of liability for such negligence” (_Rashid_ at \[30\], emphasis added). Quite clearly, _Rashid_ should not be restricted in the manner that the defendant submits.

23     In any event, the express wording of section 5 (see \[19\] above) does not limit its application only to situations where insurers sought to limit their liability. The defendant also did not argue that any other provision in the Act had this effect.

24     For completeness, the defendant also referred me to _Danny Raj a/l Muniappan v Ang Zhiqiang_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 31</span> (“**_Danny Rai_**”). It was not clear how _Danny Rai_ assisted. The court in that case did not consider the issue of whether section 5 of the Act precluded the defence of _volenti non fit injuria_. It had simply stated at \[36\]:

> 36    As I find that the evidence before me simply cannot support the plaintiff’s case on breach and causation, I do not find it necessary to address the defendant’s reliance on the defence of volenti non fit injuria.

### Whether section 5 of the Act precluded the defence of volenti non fit injuria in this case

25     In my judgment, section 5(2) of the Act is triggered to preclude the defence of _volenti non fit injuria_ in the present case. Section 5(2) applies to passengers referred to in section 5(1). Namely, passengers carried in vehicles for which a policy of insurance is required under section 3 of the Act (see \[19\] above). Section 3(1)(a) in turn mandates that a policy of insurance must be in force if a motor vehicle is used in Singapore:

> Users of motor vehicles to be insured against third-party risks

> 3.—(1)    Subject to the provisions of this Act, **it is not lawful for any person to use or to cause or permit any other person to use** —

>> (a)     **a motor vehicle in Singapore**; or

>> (b)    a motor vehicle which is registered in Singapore in any territory specified in the Schedule,

> **unless there is in force in relation to the use of the motor vehicle by that person or that other person (as the case may be) a policy of insurance** or a security in respect of third-party risks that complies with the requirements of this Act.

> (emphasis mine)

26     In the present case, it was clear that the defendant was using his car in circumstances such that a policy of insurance was required under section 3. Indeed, there was no question that the defendant was driving his car in Singapore. He had left Club Gaga which was situated at Orchard Towers[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) and was driving along the Central Expressway where he met with the accident.

27     Accordingly, there was little doubt that the plaintiff was a passenger referred to in section 5(1) such that section 5(2) is triggered to preclude the defence of _volenti non fit injuria._ As this is sufficient to dispose of this defence, I do not propose to set out my thoughts on whether the elements set out at \[16\] above are met on the facts of this case.

28     I turn to the defence of contributory negligence.

## Whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent

29     The defence of contributory negligence is contained in section 3 of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953. Section 3(1) provides:

> Apportionment of liability in case of contributory negligence

> 3.—(1)    Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.

30     In determining whether a claimant has been contributorily negligent, the court will consider whether the claimant failed to take reasonable care for his own personal safety. This would be the case if the claimant ought to have objectively foreseen that his failure to act prudently could result in hurting himself but he failed to take reasonable measures to guard against that foreseeable harm: _Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 944</span> (“**_Li Jianlin_**”) at \[18\]-\[19\].

31     The defendant’s case was that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent because:

> (a)     the plaintiff took a lift from him even though she knew that he had been consuming alcohol;[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

> (b)     the plaintiff did not secure her seatbelt;[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) and

> (c)     the plaintiff distracted him whilst he was driving by tapping on his left hand and asking her to look at him.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

32     I consider each ground in turn.

### Whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by taking a lift from the defendant

33     I accept that a passenger can be guilty of contributory negligence if he accepts a lift from a driver whom he knows is drunk. Michael A. Jones, _Clerk & Lindsell on Torts_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 22 Ed, 2018) explains at \[3-91\] that:

> 3-91 Drunken drivers **A passenger who accepts a lift in a vehicle driven by a person whom he knows to be drunk is likely to be bound contributorily negligent if he suffers injury in an accident caused at least in part by the driver’s impaired capacity to drive carefully.** When the claimant has accompanied the defendant on a prolonged drinking bout, knowing full well that the defendant will be going to drive, he is still contributorily negligent albeit his own capacity to judge the reasonableness of his conduct is similarly impaired. But where there is no evidence that the defendant was acting in a way which would indicate that he was unable to drive safely, the claimant passenger will not necessarily be held contributorily negligent simply by failing to question the defendant driver as to how much alcohol he has consumed.

> (emphasis mine)

34     The point has also been accepted by foreign jurisdictions (see \[53\]-\[55\] below) and the locally in _Supa\`at Bin Haji Reduan and Naimah Binte Sukaimi (the parent and dependents of Edil Asyraff Bin Supa\`at deceased) v Nur Azhar Bin Sulaiman_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 313</span> (“**_Supa\`at_**”). In _Supa\`at_, the court considered, _inter alia_, whether a pillion passenger was contributorily negligent for riding with a motorcyclist who had consumed alcohol. The court held that the pillion passenger would be contributorily negligent if he knew that: (a) the motorcyclist had been drinking, and (b) the motorcyclist’s faculties were impaired such that he would not be able to properly manage and control his vehicle (_Supa\`at_ at \[25\]-\[27\]). However, the defence failed because the court found that the motorcyclist’s ability to manage and control his motorcycle was not impaired by his drinking (_Supa\`at_ at \[34\]).

35     I turn to the facts before me. It was common ground that the defendant was drinking alcohol and that his ability to drive was impaired. This was unsurprising. He had been drinking for about 6 to 7 hours before the drive (see \[7\]-\[12\] (above)).

36     Notwithstanding, the plaintiff sought to resist the defence. She claimed that she had accepted the lift because:

> (a)     the defendant insisted on giving her a lift.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) This was amplified in her second AEIC where she alleged that the defendant had “dragged \[her\] out of \[her\] seat in the taxi”;[^20]

> (b)     she did not know how much the defendant drank that night; and

> (c)     the defendant “held out himself as someone being fit to drive”[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

37     I deal with each point in turn.

38     Starting with the first point, I was prepared to find that the defendant had offered to give the plaintiff a lift. This was the plaintiff’s consistent evidence. Furthermore, even though the defendant initially claimed that it was the plaintiff who had “asked \[him\] for a ride home”,[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) he admitted during cross examination that “he could not even remember being at the taxi stand”[^23] and accepted that he could not contradict the plaintiff because he was intoxicated.[^24]

39     However, I was not prepared to find that the defendant had compelled the plaintiff into accepting a lift from him or that the defendant had dragged her out of the taxi. This was a material fact which should have been pleaded. But she did not do so. Furthermore, if this allegation were true, I would also have expected the plaintiff to have made this allegation in her first AEIC. But again she did not do so. Instead, she made this allegation in her second AEIC and in response to the defendant’s AEIC.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) In any event, the plaintiff’s own evidence showed that she was not compelled to accept a lift from the defendant. In her first AEIC, the plaintiff stated that “she had agreed to his proposition”[^26] and that she “would not have put \[herself\] at risk by boarding his car if \[she\] had known that he was unfit to drive.”[^27] Similarly, the plaintiff stated in her second AEIC that she “would not have boarded the Defendant’s car had \[she\] known that he was above the alcohol limit.”[^28] Quite clearly, the plaintiff could have refused the ride if she had wanted to.

40     I turn to the plaintiff’s knowledge. I had little doubt that the plaintiff knew that the defendant had drunk a lot before offering her a lift home. First, even though there was some dispute as to how much time the plaintiff spent with the defendant that night, it was common ground that the plaintiff was in the same nightclubs as the defendant from about 1 September 2019 10:00 pm to 2 September 2019, 5:00 am (see \[8\]-\[12\] above). Second, it was also the plaintiff’s own evidence that she saw the defendant drinking.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) In fact, her own witness, Ms Cao Yiran, also testified that the plaintiff played games and drank with the group when she was in Club De Zara.[^30]Third, and in any event, it is the plaintiff’s own evidence that she had been working in nightclubs for more than a year at that point.[^31] She would have known that patrons such as the defendant would have been drinking.

41     Under these circumstances, the plaintiff should have appreciated the risk of the defendant being in no position to drive. In fact, this risk was underscored when Ms Cao told her to take a taxi home with the defendant.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

42     This brings me to the plaintiff’s assertion that the defendant “held himself as someone being fit to drive”.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) I reject this assertion. During cross examination, the plaintiff admitted that she did not ask the defendant or check whether he was fit to drive or not.[^34] She testified that that she had determined that the defendant was fit to drive based on a few sentences which she heard him speak and the way he walked to the taxi stand.[^35]

43     Under these circumstances, I find that the plaintiff had failed to take reasonable measures to guard against foreseeable harm. Even though she knew that the defendant had been drinking for 6-7 hours, she placed her life in his hands by allowing him to drive her home without even checking whether he was in a state to do so.

### Whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent for any other reason

44     I turn to the defendant’s remaining two assertions reasons for why the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. Namely, that (a) the plaintiff did not secure her seatbelt, and (b) she distracted him whilst he was driving.

45     I start with the seatbelt assertion. I accept that this would have been a sufficient basis to find contributory negligence if established. However, the burden of proving the point rested on the defendant and the evidence did not support such a finding. Whereas the plaintiff insisted that she wore her seatbelt,[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) the defendant admitted during cross examination that he was too intoxicated to know whether she was wearing a seatbelt or not.[^37] Indeed, the sole basis of his assertion was a conversation between himself and a doctor. This is set out in \[11\] of his AEIC:

> 11.    I also wish to add that it appears that the Plaintiff did not fasten a seatbelt as evidenced by her serious injuries. There was a seatbelt line ‘marked’ across my chess after the accident which clearly shows that I had fastened my seatbelt and I therefore sustained no injury from the collision. At the hospital, I asked the doctor as to why my passenger, the Plaintiff, had sustained such serious injuries whereas I managed to escape unharmed, the doctor’s opinion was that it is likely that the Plaintiff had not fastened a seatbelt.

46     However, the doctor in question was not called to give evidence. As such the defendant’s evidence of their conversation as proof of the doctor’s opinion was hearsay and inadmissible. This is for good reason. Having failed to call the doctor as his witness, the defendant deprived the plaintiff of having the opportunity to test the doctor’s evidence. Indeed, it was not even clear that the doctor was in any position to make the above opinion. No evidence was led as to establish the doctor’s qualifications or experience dealing with similar motor accidents. No evidence was led to prove that the doctor had examined both the plaintiff and the defendant to reach the supposed conclusion that he did.

47     I turn to the defendant’s allegation that the plaintiff had distracted him when he was driving. Though pleaded,[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) the defendant ultimately did not rely on this allegation. The point was not raised in his Closing Submissions.[^39] And in his Reply Submissions, the defendant did not rely on this allegation as an independent ground for contributorily negligence. Instead, he submitted that the details of the alleged distraction were “minutiae” which were “not substantial”,[^40] and he relied on this point only as evidence that the plaintiff “was not intoxicated to that extent as to be unaware of her situation.”[^41]

> 16.     **The Plaintiff attempts to make a meal out of the Defendant not mentioning minutiae like the Plaintiff tapping his hand and asking him to look at her in his reports. These are mere details which are not substantial** in a case where he collided into the rear of another car. In any event, in the GIA report, the Defendant stated that he “was facing her for just a split second” and in his Police Report he states that he “was in a conversation with an acquaintance named Corrine (the Plaintiff) … I was facing her just for a split second”. Further, during cross-examination, the Defendant elaborated that “it was a both-way conversation, and then she was like tapping my hand, keeping…asking me to focus” (NE 2nd Tranche p. 7 lines 8-11).

> 17.    From the above, it can be seen that the Defendant has remained consistent with his account - he was in a conversation with the Plaintiff when she suddenly tapped his hand, causing him to be distracted. **The Defendant’s account is important as it also goes to show that the Plaintiff was lucid enough to be able to converse with the Defendant and had the presence of mind to ask him to look at her and focus on the road as his driving was impaired.** All this is in line with the Defendant’s version he was highly intoxicated to properly manage and control his car, but **the Plaintiff was not intoxicated to that extent as to be unaware of her situation**.

> (emphasis mine)

48     Given that the defendant was no longer relying on the alleged distraction as an independent basis to find contributorily negligence, I make no finding on the alleged distraction.

### Conclusion

49     For the reasons above, I find that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent for taking a lift from the defendant. However, I reject the contentions that she failed to secure her seatbelt and distracted the defendant whilst he was driving.

## Apportionment of liability

50     I turn to the apportionment of liability. As noted, section 3 of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953 provides that “the damages recoverable … shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.”

51     In this respect, it has been observed that the apportionment exercise is to be applied in a “rough and ready” manner and that the factors which the court is required to consider are “incapable of precise measurement” and are often “incommensurable”: _Li Jianlin_ at \[118\]. It is likely due to this reason that the court in _Supa\`at_ observed at \[23\] that “there was a whole gamut of percentages” in cases where contributorily negligence was found. That said, two considerations are particularly relevant in apportioning liability: first, the relative causative potency of the parties’ conduct; and second, the relative moral blameworthiness of the parties’ conduct: _Li Jianlin_ at \[118\].

52     This is illustrated by the following cases.

53     I start with _Owens v Brimmel_ <span class="citation">\[1977\] 1 QB 859</span> (“**_Ownes_**”). In this case, the passenger and driver were friends who had been driving in the latter’s car. At about 8 pm, they went out and visited a number of public houses and finally a club. The driver estimated that they both drank about 8 to 9 pints of beer. At about 2 am the next morning, the driver met with an accident whilst driving the passenger home. The court found the passenger guilty of contributory negligence and reduced the amount of damages he was entitled to by 20%. The court held that even though both the driver and passenger were equally “befuddled by drink”, it was the driver alone who controlled the car and thus had it in him to do more damage.

54     I turn next to the Manitoba Court of Appeal decision in _Stein v Lehnert_ 31 DLR (2d) 673 (“**_Stein_**”) which was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in _Lehnert v Stein_ \[1963\] SCR 38. In this case, the driver met the passenger and her friend in a restaurant. The driver had been drinking before meeting them but there was no evidence that the passenger or her friend knew how much he drank before meeting them. The passenger had a drink with the driver at the restaurant before proceeding to a nightclub with him. There, the driver was served 10 ounces of rye whiskey in less than 2 hours. The evidence revealed that while the passenger did not know the driver well, she had been out with him before. And on these occasions, he always drove too fast, paid no attention to any protest, and that she was always afraid of an accident when driving with him. Nevertheless, the passenger allowed the driver to drive her home. On these facts, the passenger was found to be guilty of contributorily negligence. The Manitoba Court of Appeal reduced her damages by 25%, noting that she could have abandoned the driver and not entered his car.

55     The next case I consider is _Berryman v Josyln_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] NSWCA 121</span> (“**_Berryman_**”). In this case, the claimant and the defendant had been drinking at a party until about 4:00 am. The claimant was driving his vehicle initially. However, the defendant noticed that he was falling asleep at the wheel and insisted that she take over. Shortly after she started driving, the vehicle overturned injuring the claimant. The New South Wales Court of Appeal found the claimant 60% liable for driving the vehicle initially and handing over the vehicle to the defendant who was in a poorer condition to drive than he was. In this respect, the court noted that: (a) unlike the claimant who knew that his vehicle had a propensity to roll, the defendant had never driven the vehicle before; (b) unlike the claimant who was licensed and experienced at driving the vehicle, the defendant was unlicensed and had not driven for three years; and (c) unlike the claimant who had eaten at a McDonald’s shortly before the accident, the defendant had not eaten and had less sleep than him.

56     I turn to the facts before me. First and foremost, I thought that the facts before me were quite dissimilar to _Berryman._ Crucially, in _Berryman_, the plaintiff knew that the defendant should not have been driving for a variety of reasons other than having drunk that night. Namely, the _Berryman_ defendant was a unlicensed and inexperienced driver who was unfamiliar with the car. By contrast, however, the only reason why the plaintiff in this case was contributorily negligent is because she knew that the defendant had spent the night drinking.

57     It is also my view that this case bore greater similarity to _Owens_ and _Stein_ such that the defendant should bear greater liability for this accident:

> (a)     I start with the relative moral blameworthiness. Like the passengers in _Owens_ and _Stein_, the plaintiff in this case was not free from blame. She knew that the defendant had been drinking and could have chosen not to enter the defendant’s car. Indeed, given her occupation, it might be said that she should have been more alive to the risks of accepting rides from drunk drivers than most. That said, the defendant was also not free from blame. He knew that he had been drinking for 6-7 hours. He should not have been driving but still he offered to drive the plaintiff home.

> (b)     I turn to the relative causative potency of the parties’ conduct. While the plaintiff may have put herself in harm’s way by accepting a lift from the defendant, it was the defendant who initiated the drive. It was also the defendant who was controlling the car. Quite clearly, he had greater control over whether parties met with an accident or not.

58     Bearing the above in mind, I find the plaintiff 25% responsible for her injuries, and the defendant the remaining 75%.

## Conclusion
