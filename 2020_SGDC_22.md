3 February 2020

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused (in person) claimed trial to a single charge of ‘long-term’ (“LT1”) consumption of a specified drug (methamphetamine) which is an offence under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) (“MDA”). He was also liable to an enhanced sentence of 116 days under s 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act (Cap. 247) for committing the said LT1 offence during the period of his remission.

2       Eight largely unrelated charges for theft and other miscellaneous offences were stood down pending the trial of the LT1 offence.

3       At the conclusion of the trial, the accused was convicted of the LT1 charge. He also pleaded guilty to four of the stood down theft charges and consented to have the remaining charges taken in consideration by the court. He was sentenced in total to five years' and eight months' imprisonment with an enhanced sentence of 116 days' imprisonment, plus three strokes of the cane. The accused is appealing only against the conviction and is presently serving his sentence.

## The Charge

4       For ease of reference, I set out the LT1 charge of which the accused was convicted:

> You…are charged that you, sometime on or before 7 July 2018 in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 (2008 Rev Ed), to wit, Methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of The Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 (2008 Rev Ed).

> And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 13 February 2016, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under Section 34(2)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed), admitted to an approved institution, namely Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Cluster B, Changi Prison Complex, for the offence of consumption of a controlled drug, to wit, methamphetamine, and were on 10 January 2018, in District Court 16, vide DAC 935133-2017, convicted of an offence for consumption of failure to provide a urine specimen, an offence under s 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment, which conviction has not been set aside to date and you are thereby liable to be punished under s 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

> And further, that you, from 2 July 2018 to 30 October 2018, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev. Ed. 2014) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order is in effect you, on 7 July 2018, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under section 50T of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 116 days from 7 July 2018 to 30 October 2018 for that offence.

## The Prosecution’s Case

5       The prosecution called nine witnesses to prove its case against the accused. These witnesses included the arresting officers[^1] and the officers[^2] who had procured urine samples from the accused, conducted an instant urine test (“IUT”) and sealed the remaining samples which were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for testing. The two HSA analysts who tested the urine samples were also called to give evidence.

6       The accused did not dispute the circumstances of his arrest at all. He had no questions to ask of the arresting officers. Briefly, acting on a report of theft of a mobile phone, the accused was arrested at his residence on 5 July 2018.[^3] The stolen phone was found at his residence. He was then sent to and warded at Khoo Teck Puat hospital (“the hospital”) because of an alleged injury (laceration to the head) that he suffered as a result of an unrelated scuffle with an unidentified friend prior to his arrest. He was released on personal bond after a police statement was recorded from him at the hospital. However, before his discharge, the hospital informed the police that the hospital tests showed that the accused had consumed illicit drugs. The accused was re-arrested on 7 July 2018 for drug consumption.[^4]

7       Evidence was then led as to how the accused’s urine samples were collected from the accused as per the standard procedure. The prosecution witnesses testified that the accused’s urine samples (which were eventually sent to HSA for analysis) were properly procured from the accused. The accused did not dispute the urine procurement process although he did not distinctly recall who procured his urine and he also suggested that he might have had some difficulty urinating. He did not dispute that the urine samples belonged to him. He accepted the IUT result which showed that his urine was positive for amphetamine. He also did not challenge the results of the urine analysis by the two HSA officers[^5] who testified in court that both his urine samples contained methamphetamine, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA. The HSA certificates that were prepared by these officers were admitted in evidence.[^6] Finally, the predicate antecedents for the LT1 charge were also not disputed i.e. a prior DRC admission to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) for consumption of methamphetamine[^7] and a prior conviction for failing to provide a urine specimen.[^8] In other words, the basis of the LT1 charge was not in dispute.

## Legal Presumption

8       The accused did not challenge the evidence in respect of the procurement of his urine samples. Therefore, as correctly submitted by the prosecution[^9], it is not in dispute that the accused’s urine samples were procured in compliance with s 31(4)(b) of the MDA. The HSA certificates stated that accused’s urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine, a controlled drug (in addition to also being a specified drug) listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The results of the analysis were not challenged.

9       Section 22 of the MDA provides for a legal presumption of consumption of a controlled drug as follows:

> **Presumption relating to urine test**

> 22.    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).

10     Therefore, given the presence of methamphetamine (a controlled drug) in the two urine samples, the accused is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed methamphetamine. This presumption presumes both the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_ of the offence of consumption of the controlled drug.[^10] The evidential burden therefore shifted to the accused to disprove either of these elements on a balance of probabilities.[^11]

11     Accordingly, the accused was called upon to give his defence to the LT1 charge.

## The Defence

12     The accused chose to take the stand to give evidence. He had no other witnesses. He denied consuming methamphetamine. Even though he accepted that his urine contained methamphetamine, he maintained that he did not know why his urine had tested positive for the said drug. He was unable to explain why this was so. Essentially, he gave the following main defences[^12] which I will address in turn further along in my judgment:

> (i)     He consumed medication administered or prescribed by the hospital and also IMH i.e what is commonly known as a ‘medication’ defence;

> (ii)     He also consumed non-prescription medication (i.e. cough syrup, “sunniton”, “power” and “epam”);

> (iii)     Self-contamination in that he might have touched something in the cell which transferred from his hand to the urine when he was urinating;[^13] and in any event,

> (iv)     He was intoxicated at the time of his arrest and did not know what happened.

13     Finally, the accused also suggested that he may have had difficulty urinating.

## Court’s Findings and Decision

14     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the accused did not dispute the results of the analysis conducted by HSA and also did not impugn the handling or integrity of the urine samples which were procured from him.[^14] I was satisfied and I found that the HSA drug analyses were conducted in compliance with s 31(4)(b) of the MDA and I accepted that the two HSA certificates, which were admitted pursuant to s 16 of the MDA, constituted presumptive proof of the matters set out therein (_Tan Chin Hock v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 1079</span> at \[26\]). The s 22 presumption operated to presume that the accused person has, in contravention of s 8(b) of the MDA, consumed methamphetamine. As stated above, both the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_ of the offence are presumed and the onus then shifted to the accused to rebut the presumption, on a balance of probabilities. Also as pointed out by the prosecution, it is insufficient for the accused to simply raise a reasonable doubt (_PP v Tan Loon Lui_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 216</span> at \[6\]).

15     I considered the various defences of the accused and rejected them. My reasons are as follows.

### (i)   Medication defence

16     I rejected the accused’s medication defence. A list of all the medication that were administered or prescribed to the accused by the hospital and IMH was obtained and compiled by the investigating officer.[^15] This list was shown to the HSA officers. I accepted the HSA officers’ testimonies that none of the listed medication would give rise to methamphetamine being found in a person’s urine. The accused did not challenge the HSA officers’ opinion.[^16] I further accepted the analysts’ evidence that there are no over-the-counter medication that would give rise to methamphetamine in the urine and that only the consumption of methamphetamine will result in the metabolism of methamphetamine in the human body.[^17] In the present case, the accused’s urine samples were found to contain levels of methamphetamine (2820ng/ml of urine and 3880ng/ml of urine respectively) that were well above threshold the level of 500ng/ml of urine before a positive HSA certificate would be issued.[^18] I was satisfied that none of the medications would, if consumes, would give rise to methamphetamine in the body. I found that the accused did in fact consume methamphetamine.

17     In light of the testimonies of the HSA experts which I accepted and which evidence was not challenged by the accused, I had no difficulty rejecting the accused’s medication defence.

### (ii)   Non-prescription medication defence

18     I also rejected his defence that he had consumed some other medication, much of which appeared to be non-prescription and likely illicit medication. These comprise of cough syrup which he claimed to have purchased from Geylang and three other types of medication which he named as “sunniton”, “power” and “epam”.

19     Apart from the cough syrup, it was pointed out by the prosecution (which point was not disputed by the accused) that the other three medications were not mentioned in the investigation statements that were recorded from the accused pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code.[^19] The accused made it clear in those statements that apart from the listed prescription medications and the cough syrup from Geylang, he did not consume any other medication. He only mentioned “_sunniton”_, “_power”_ and “epam” at the eleventh hour during his examination-in-chief. I therefore agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the inclusion of these three medications was an afterthought. In any case, the HSA analysts’ evidence was that there are no known over-the-counter medications that would give rise to methamphetamine in one’s urine. The accused did not provide details or circumstances as to how he had obtained the said medications. The HSA analysts were also unable to comment further unless they were told of the active ingredients in these medications. It looked to me that these were illicit non-prescription medications which were _not_ purchased over the counter. Therefore, I found that even if the accused had consumed these medications, he would not have rebutted the presumption.

20     The same conclusion would also apply to the cough syrup which he claimed to have purchased from Geylang. He conceded when cross-examined by the learned DPP that he was unable to identity the person who sold him the cough syrup. He could not provide any detail as to the name, brand, packaging, let alone ingredients of the cough syrup. The proper inference to be drawn was that either he did not consume any cough syrup or that the cough syrup came from an illicit source. In any event, no scientific evidence was adduced by him to prove that consumption of the cough syrup (or, for that matter, any of the other types of medication) will result in him passing out methamphetamine in his urine. Far from being able to rebut the presumption, I found that his admission that he had consumed illicit cough syrup from Geylang would reinforce the operative presumption that he knowingly consumed methamphetamine.

### (iii)   Self-contamination

21     I agreed with prosecution’s submission that the accused’s suggestion that he might have contaminated his urine sample (by touching something in the cell and then coming into contact with his penis while urinating) is nothing short of wild speculation.[^20] The accused did not provide any factual or scientific basis to even put forward such a theory, let alone prove it on a balance of probabilities. I therefore rejected his defence of self-contamination.

22     I would also point out that this suggestion of self-contamination flew in the face of his other suggestion (which I also rejected) that he had difficulty urinating. In this regard, I accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that the accused had no difficulty in providing his urine.

### (iv)   Intoxication

23     Essentially, the accused claimed he was intoxicated and did not know what happened. In any event, since he was intoxicated, he could not have intentionally consumed methamphetamine even if he did, in fact, consume methamphetamine. I rejected this defence which was no more effective in rebutting the presumption than a bare denial. The accused did not provide details as to how he became intoxicated or what was the cause of his intoxication. He also did not suggest that his state of intoxication was anything but voluntary. Far from displacing the presumption, his admission that he was intoxicated was entirely consonant with the operative presumption that he had consumed methamphetamine. His admitted state of intoxication was also consistent with the arresting officers’ and hospital staff’s observation that he appeared to be high on drugs. The circumstances, considered as a whole, support the conclusion and reinforced the presumption that he had voluntarily consumed methamphetamine.

## Conclusion

24     Having considered all the evidence and rejecting the accused’s defence, I found that he has failed to rebut the presumption of consumption of methamphetamine under s 22 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities.

25     Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted him of the LT1 charge.
