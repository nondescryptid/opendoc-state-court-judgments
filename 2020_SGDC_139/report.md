Criminal Law – Women’s Charter, Cap 353 – Section 39(3), Criminal Procedure Code

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9417/2020/01.\]

19 June 2020

### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused is a 37 year-old female China National who claimed trial to three charges. The charges read:

> DAC 919605/2018

> “You… are charged that you, on 1 August 2017 at No. 11 Lorong 39 Geylang #XXX, Singapore (“the unit”), did knowingly receive a gratification of S$560 from one Zeng Lingping (“Mdm Zeng”) as an inducement for providing a service, to wit, for renting a room in the unit to Mdm Zeng for her to provide sexual services to her clients, and by providing the said service, you would aid the prostitution of Mdm Zeng, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 146(1A) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed).

> DAC 919606/2018

> “You…are charged that you, on 8 August 2017 at No. 11 Lorong 39 Geylang #XXX, Singapore (“the unit”), did knowingly receive gratification of S$560 from one Zeng Lingping (“Mdm Zeng”) as an inducement for providing a service, to wit, for renting a room in the unit to Mdm Zeng, for her to provide sexual services to her clients, and by providing the said service, you would aid the prostitution of the said Mdm Zeng, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 146(1A) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed).

> DAC 919607/2018

> “You….are charged that you, on 17 August 2017 at or about 2.50 p.m., at the lock-up interview room of Central Police Divisional Headquarters located at No. 391 New Bridge Road, Singapore, being a person having charge of the operation of your Apple iPhone 7Plus mobile phone, did fail to comply with a requirement of Senior Station Inspector Ng Bee Yean (“SSI Ng”), a police officer with the Singapore Police Force, to wit, by failing to provide your password to the phone, when SSI Ng required your assistance to gain access to the phone, that SSI Ng had reasonable cause to suspect had been used in connection with an arrestable offence, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 39(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted her on all three charges. She was sentenced to a total term of 2 months and 3 weeks’ imprisonment. This appeal is filed against conviction only.

## Women’s Charter Offences

### Elements of the offence

3       For each of the charges, the Prosecution needs to prove the following:

> (a)     That the Accused did knowingly receive gratification of $560 from one Zeng Lingping (hereafter “Mdm Zeng”);

> (b)     the gratification was received as an inducement for providing a service, which was to rent Mdm Zeng a room in the unit #XXX at No.11 Lorong 39 Geylang, Singapore, for her to provide sexual services;

> (c)     In so doing, the Accused had aided the prostitution of Mdm Zeng.

## Prosecution’s evidence relating to the Women’s Charter Offences

4       The Prosecution’s case was that the Accused had rented a room in unit #XXX in a condominium at No. 11 Lorong 39 Geylang to Mdm Zeng. Mdm Zeng paid rent to the Accused and used the room to provide sexual services to her clients and the Accused was aware of that.

### Facts surrounding the arrest of the Accused

5       On 15 August 2017, a party consisting of officers from the Crime Control Unit, Voluntary Special Constabulary and Compliance Management Unit raided the condominium[^1] at No. 11 Lorong 39 Geylang (hereafter “the condominium”). PW1 Station Inspector Chew Wei Bin, who was leading the advance party, testified that they were actually on a gambling suppression raid at the location.

6       On that day at about 11 pm, after conducting an ambush on unit #XXX based on information received[^2], PW1 SI Chew noticed the Accused and PW12 Wei Ge Yu loitering outside unit #XXX. Subsequently, the Accused and PW12 Wei were placed under arrest at the staircase landing of level 8. At the time of the arrest, the Accused was found in possession of one Apple iPhone 7 Plus[^3] (hereafter “Apple iPhone”), one bunch of two keys and one remote[^4] and one bunch of three keys, one remote and one pink tag[^5].

7       Upon checking the Apple iPhone which was seized from the Accused, PW1 SI Chew testified that he discovered several “incriminating messages”, suggesting that the Accused was involved in a vice syndicate. Amongst several messages, one was a template message sent out by a “vice worker” in reply to clients who were interested in her (the vice-worker’s) services[^6]. Subsequently, PW1 SI Chew followed up on another mobile number contained in a message[^7] found in the Apple iPhone which offered “smoothing massage and full course of special service”. This led him to an advertisement found online[^8]. In response to the advertisement, PW1 SI Chew posed as a customer[^9], which eventually led him to unit #XXX in the condominium. Unit #XXX was ascertained to be a “vice den”[^10] and the two female subjects found therein were established to be Mdm Zeng and PW3 Huang Lifang.

### Statements of Zeng Lingping

8       Mdm Zeng was not present in court to give evidence. The Prosecution sought to admit three statements given by Mdm Zeng, through section 32(1)(j)(ii) or section 32(1)(j)(iii) of the Evidence Act, Chapter 97.

9       PW2 Angeline Ng Bee Yean, the Investigating Officer of this case, testified how she made several attempts to contact Mdm Zeng through various means such as WeChat, phone calls[^11] and with the help of PW3 Huang Lifang. However, she was unable to locate her. When she did manage to speak to a female who identified herself as Mdm Zeng’s daughter, PW2 IO Angeline Ng was informed that Mdm Zeng had left for Dubai[^12]. The fact of Mdm Zeng being in Dubai was corroborated by WeChat conversation between Mdm Zeng and PW3 Huang Lifang[^13] as well as by PW3 Huang Lifang herself when she gave evidence[^14].

10     The efforts of PW2 IO Angeline Ng in locating Mdm Zeng were conscientiously recorded in her investigation diary[^15]. She testified that she had done so because she was not confident that she could secure the attendance of Mdm Zeng for the trial. Based on the ICA screening[^16] obtained by PW2 IO Angeline Ng, Mdm Zeng left Singapore on 6 July 2019 (after a trial against this same Accused in which Mdm Zeng had availed herself as a witness, was vacated) and had not returned to Singapore since then. 6 July 2019 was also PW2 IO Angeline Ng’s last contact with Mdm Zeng.

11     Having heard the evidence of PW2 Angeline Ng, I was satisfied that reasonable efforts had been expended to locate Mdm Zeng but she could not be located and produced in court. It was clear that Mdm Zeng remained outside of Singapore. As Mdm Zeng’s evidence was relevant to the case, I admitted the following three statements:-

> (a)     an oral statement recorded on 16 August 2017 by PW1 SI Chew Wei Bin;

> (b)     an oral statement recorded on 16 August 2017 by PW7 Station Inspector Ng Wee Hong; and

> (c)     a written statement recorded on 17 August 2017 at 3.00pm by PW4 Station Inspector Louis Tan Kah Siong[^17].

12     In her oral and police statements, Mdm Zeng maintained that the Accused, who was known to her as “Xiao Yu Er”, was the landlord who rented a “work room” in the unit #XXX to her. As the Prosecution highlighted in their submissions[^18]:-

> (a)     In her oral contemporaneous statement given to PW1 SI Chew on the day of her arrest, Mdm Zeng identified the Accused to be her rent collector. She confirmed the Accused’s knowledge of her prostitution activities in the unit. Mdm Zeng further informed that the Accused had recommended male customers to her, and would collect S$20 for each successful transaction involving sexual services. Mdm Zeng indicated that she paid the Accused a total of S$60 for three successful transactions;

> (b)     In another contemporaneous oral statement given to PW7 SI Ng Wee Hong on the day of her arrest, Mdm Zeng similarly identified the Accused as the person who collected her rental fee from her. She indicated that she had rented a room in the unit since 1 August 2017, with a daily rental fee of about S$100, and that the Accused would collect the rental fee from her once every seven days.

> (c)     In a statement recorded on 17 August 2017, Mdm Zeng indicated that she had rented a “Kai Gong Fang” (a “work room”) from the Accused, who was known to her as “Xiao Yu Er”, on 1 August 2017, after she showed her around the unit. Mdm Zeng explained in her statement that the term “Kai Gong Fang” is commonly used in the vice trade which refers to a room where she could stay and at the same time, provide sexual services to her clients. Mdm Zeng stated that she paid cash of S$560 to the Accused on the same day, for seven days of rental, and an additional deposit of S$50 for the key to the Unit. Mdm Zeng also confirmed that she had paid the Accused cash of S$560 on two occasions, namely, 1 and 8 August 2017 respectively, and the cash on each occasion represented her rental fee for seven days. Mdm Zeng indicated that the Accused should have knowledge of her occupation (_i.e._ a prostitute), as the Accused was the one who had expressly informed that the room which would be rented to her was a “work room”. The term “Kai Gong Fang” Mdm Zeng further informed that the rental of the “work room” allowed her to provide sexual services to her clients from 1 to 14 August 2017, during which she serviced a total of six clients.

### Reliability of the evidence of Zeng Lingping

13     Mdm Zeng’s oral and written statements contained incriminating evidence against the Accused. In considering her evidence, I was mindful that Mdm Zeng was not present in court to give her testimony and to be cross-examined by the Accused; her evidence was unchallenged. I was careful to scrutinise the statements of Mdm Zeng for accuracy as well as truth.

#### High degree of consistency

14     I found the evidence contained in Mdm Zeng’s statements to be reliable. She gave a detailed and coherent account in her police statement, describing how she arrived in Singapore, the work she engaged in, how she got to know “Xiao Yu Er”, whom she positively identified to be the Accused. When Mdm Zeng was interviewed by PW7 SI Ng Wee Hong, it was also his evidence that she was co-operative and forthcoming in her replies in his questions[^19]. More importantly, the statements of Mdm Zeng, given to different police officers at different times, were consistent in material aspects. The table below amply illustrates:

15     Apart from the high level of consistency demonstrated in the statements that Mdm Zeng gave to various police officers, Mdm Zeng’s evidence that she had paid rent to the Accused was also corroborated by the testimony of PW3 Huang Lifang.

#### Mdm Zeng’s statements were corroborated by the evidence of PW3 Huang Lifang

16     PW3 Huang Lifang was other female arrested in unit #XXX on 15 August 2017. She testified that she was providing massage, masturbation and other sexual services from a room in unit #XXX in the condominium. She rented the room from “Xiao Yu Er, the landlord”, whom she positively identified as the Accused[^31]. PW3 Huang Lifang also recognised Mdm Zeng from the photograph in the passport[^32] shown to her as “Da Jie” [^33].

17     PW3 Huang Lifang confirmed that Mdm Zeng, whom she knew as “Da Jie”, was staying in the same unit as her and did pay rent to “Xiao Yu Er” at about $80/90 a day. PW3 Huang Lifang testified that she had heard the Accused collecting rent from Mdm Zeng prior to her arrest, as the Accused’s voice was very loud and the rooms in the unit were very close[^34]. I agreed with the Prosecution that PW3 Huang maintained her account under rigorous cross-examination; she also testified that she had nothing to fear as she was telling the truth.

18     I found PW3 Huang Lifang to be an honest witness, straightforward in her answers and coherent in her account. I did not find any tendency on her part to embellish or exaggerate her evidence. When asked, PW3 Huang Lifang was candid and admitted that she had never witnessed Mdm Zeng handing rent to the Accused but she could hear the conversation between them because her room was close to Mdm Zeng’s room. I found her to be a credible witness. There was no basis to suggest that she had any motivation to falsely implicate the Accused.

19     On the stand, PW3 Huang Lifang testified that through her conversations with Mdm Zeng, she came to know that Mdm Zeng was providing sexual services in the unit[^35]. PW3 Huang Lifang also heard the Accused asking Mdm Zeng “how was business on that day and how many customers she attended to”[^36]. Based on PW3 Huang Lifang’s evidence as well as the evidence contained in Mdm Zeng’s police statement, I had no doubt that the Accused was aware that Mdm Zeng was providing sexual services to her clients from the room in unit #XXX

#### Other corroborative evidence

20     These other pieces of evidence corroborated the evidence of Mdm Zeng that the Accused was Mdm Zeng’s landlord:

> (a)     The messages found in Mdm Zeng’s OPPO mobile phone[^37], seized from her on the day of the arrest, revealed the landlord and tenant relationship between Mdm Zeng and the Accused. It contained messages exchanged with “Xiao Yu Er”, whom Mdm Zeng had identified as the Accused. In her WeChat messages to the Accused, Mdm Zeng referred to the Accused as the “landlord” and also sought assistance from the Accused for assistance in respect of issues pertaining to the unit. For example, when the bed frame was too low and the bed was too soft, Mdm Zeng approached the Accused and asked her if she could resolve the issue[^38];

> (b)     On the day of the arrest, the Accused was found in possession of keys[^39] which could open the main door of the unit #XXX. This meant that the Accused could gain access to the unit at ease and strongly suggested that the Accused had a good measure of control over the unit. The Accused was unable to offer any credible explanation as to how she had keys which could open the main door of unit #XXX where the tenants therein, namely Mdm Zeng and PW3 Huang Lifang, had confirmed they were providing sexual services for a fee.

> (c)     Apart from the key which could be used to access the unit, the Accused was also found in possession of a remote control which could open the gate to the condominium. When questioned by the police as to why she was at the condominium, the Accused was not able to adequately explain her presence at the condominium that evening, turning up various different explanations at different points in time[^40];

> (d)     As highlighted by the Prosecution[^41], PW12 Wei Ge Yu’s statements, which were admitted in the course of his evidence, similarly corroborated Mdm Zeng’s account of the Accused’s role as the de facto landlord of the unit. PW12 Wei Ge Yu consistently indicated in his police statements[^42] that the Accused had the keys to the gate of the condominium and the door to the unit #XXX, and was always the person bringing him to the unit for air-conditioning maintenance.

21     I was satisfied that Mdm Zeng’s evidence statements implicating the Accused as the person who had rented the room in unit #XXX to her were reliable. Mdm Zeng’s evidence, as contained in her oral and written statements, was both internally and externally consistent; they contained facts which I found were corroborated by extrinsic evidence and the testimony of witnesses.

22     In her defence, the Accused adduced another statement of Mdm Zeng[^43] and submitted that Mdm Zeng was inconsistent in her evidence in respect of the rental fee and how it was paid. However, PW9 Assistant Superintendent Benedict Cheong, who recorded the statement from Mdm Zeng, explained that the purpose of the statement was to ascertain Mdm Zeng’s involvement in prostitution activities[^44]. For that purpose, Mdm Zeng was not asked to specify the unit or the period of stay for which she was paying rental for or the identity of the landlord or who she paid the rent to. I found the contents in Exhibit D1 to be acceptable based on the explanation given by PW9 ASP Benedict Cheong.

23     I fully accepted the evidence of the police officers who had interacted with Mdm Zeng as well as the Accused on the day of her arrest. None of them were known to the Accused prior to 15 August 2017. In fact, when the raiding party descended on the condominium at No. 11 Lorong 39 Geylang, they were not there to arrest the Accused but were actually on a gambling suppression raid at the said location. It was due to the Accused’s suspicious behaviour that led to her arrest. There was no incentive on their part to embellish what had been told to them by Mdm Zeng and/or to implicate the Accused in the vice activities discovered at the location.

### No doubt that the Accused was the owner and user of the Apple iPhone

24     The Apple iPhone seized from the Accused contained incriminating evidence against the Accused. There were WeChat messages in the Apple iPhone[^45] which showed the interaction between Mdm Zeng and “Xiao Yu Er” which confirmed that the “Xiao Yu Er” was Mdm Zeng’s landlord in respect of the unit #XXX, amongst other things. There were also various conversations found in the Apple iPhone which showed that “Xiao Yu Er” knew that unit #XXX was used as a “work room” by Mdm Zeng, and when used even by others whom “Xiao Yu Er” had rented rooms to. Further, the incriminating messages contained in WeChat conversations between Mdm Zeng (WeChat name “Qing Chen”) and “Xiao Yu Er” found in the Apple iPhone[^46] also corresponded to WeChat messages found in Mdm Zeng’s OPPO mobile phone[^47]. The evidence contained in the Apple iPhone roundly refuted the Accused’s claims that she did not know Mdm Zeng and/or did not rent out the room in #XXX to Mdm Zeng and/or did not know what activities Mdm Zeng was engaged in in the unit.

25     I had no doubt in my mind that the Accused was the owner and user of the Apple iPhone which was seized from the Accused on the day of her arrest:

> (a)     The Apple iPhone was seized from the Accused herself. She was holding the Apple iPhone in her hand when she was arrested[^48]. When the Apple iPhone was seized from her, the phone was unlocked[^49] suggesting that it had been or was in a state of being used. It subsequently became locked due to inactivity[^50]. Apart from stating that the Apple iPhone did not belong to her, the Accused had no credible explanation how it came to be in her possession. She initially asserted that she found it along Geylang before claiming that it belonged to a friend which she was unable to identify, before falling into silence[^51].

> (b)     The Apple iPhone contained, amongst other things, the Accused’s personal information[^52], in particular a photograph of the Accused herself and a photograph taken of her son and herself[^53]. The Accused’s husband PW5 Tan Jian Hui Fabian’s contact (XXX) was saved in the Apple iPhone in the name of “husband” and PW12 Wei Ge Yu’s contact (XXX) was also saved in the Apple iPhone[^54].

> (c)     The WeChat messages extracted from the Apple iPhone contained the audio recordings of the Accused’s voice, responding to messages received in. The voices were identified by PW3 Huang Lifang and these messages were sent before the day of the Accused’s arrest. Both the WeChat accounts which PW3 Huang Lifang identified to be the Accused’s WeChat accounts in the name of ‘Xiao Yu Er” and “Yu Yu” were found in the Apple iPhone;

> (d)     In his police statement, which was admitted as evidence, the Accused’s husband PW5 Tan Jian Hui Fabian confirmed that the phone number of the Accused was XXX[^55], which was the same number linked to the Apple iPhone seized from the Accused[^56]. The Accused’s son, one Huang Jiasheng was aware of the password needed to unlock the Apple iPhone[^57]; he also called the Accused’s phone at the number XXX, after her arrest. The closest family members of the Accused would not have known or called the Accused at this mobile number if the Apple iPhone did not belong to the Accused;

> (e)     Whilst in police custody and the Apple iPhone was unlocked by the password provided by the Accused’s son, it was then that the Accused knew the “game was up”. At that point, she confessed to PW8 Station Inspector Bryan Ang that the Apple iPhone belonged to her and attempted to explain why she had denied ownership of the phone initially[^58].

26     The Accused’s assertion that the Apple iPhone was not hers was completely unbelievable. Her various explanations for how the Apple iPhone came to be in her possession or how she obtained the phone was inconsistent right up from the time she was arrested. She vacillated in her claims, first saying that she did not know who the phone belonged to, before claiming that it belonged to a friend whose identity she was not aware of. Thereafter in her police statement recorded on 16 August 2017, she stated that one “Xin Xin” had passed the phone to her[^59] but subsequently in a further statement recorded on 17 August 2017, she changed her position by stating that she did not know who the phone belonged to[^60].

27     In court during evidence-in-chief, the Accused claimed that the Apple iPhone was bought by her husband which she later sold to one “Xiao Yu Er”[^61], only to state later under cross-examination that the phone belonged to one “Liu Yu Mei” who was also “Xiao Yu Er”[^62]. The Accused also offered different versions of the circumstances under which the Apple iPhone came to be in her possession.

28     The Accused was also not able to adequately explain how her personal photos came to be in the Apple iPhone or why her voice would be captured in the voice messages sent from the phone. Her eventual version in court that the phone belonged to one “Liu Yu Mei” was never raised to any police officer upon or after her arrest; nor was it mentioned in any of her statements. This claim was clearly an afterthought.

29     Given the Accused’s relentless change in her positions and claims viz-a-viz the Apple iPhone, I did not find her evidence credible at all. I disbelieved her and rejected her evidence.

### No doubt that the Accused was the owner and user of the “Xiao Yu Er” WeChat account and was “Xiao Yu Er”.

30     The Accused vehemently denied that she was “Xiao Yu Er” or was the “Xiao Yu Er” in the WeChat account. This was despite positive identification by PW3 Huang Lifang in court that she was “Xiao Yu Er” and also by Mdm Zeng in her police statements.

31     The evidence presented before the Court clearly showed that the Accused was the owner and user of the “Xiao Yu Er” WeChat accounts, and that she was “Xiao Yu Er”:

> (a)     The WeChat messages sent by “Xiao Yu Er” from the Apple iPhone contained private information which only the Accused would be privy to. As highlighted by the Prosecution, in the WeChat messages sent from the “Xiao Yu Er” account, “Xiao Yu Er” referred to a son whom she brought to Singapore, indicated that her son was given a student pass, that she was tired of handling her son who was a Primary two student as of 23 December 2016[^63]. The Accused admitted that the facts disclosed in the WeChat messages were a reflection of her situation in her testimony;

> (b)     PW3 Huang Lifang, PW12 Wei Ge Yu and Mdm Zeng separately identified the Accused’s WeChat username as “Xiao Yu Er”. PW3 Huang Lifang testified that she communicated with the Accused through her “Xiao Yu Er” account and she also knew the Accused personally as “Xiao Yu Er”. She confirmed that the WeChat account “Xiao Yu Er” with the WeChat ID “lovelove888888” was the Accused’s account[^64];

> (c)     As mentioned earlier, the Apple iPhone contained voice recordings sent by “Xiao Yu Er” in response to WeChat messages received. The voice in these audio messages were identified to be the Accused’s voice by PW3 Huang Lifang when the recordings were played for her in court. On hearing it, it was undeniably the voice of the Accused.

> (d)     In her WeChat messages to other WeChat contacts, “Xiao Yu Er” identified her phone number as XXX, a mobile number which has been ascertained to be the number linked to the Apple iPhone seized from the Accused on the day of her arrest.

32     I found the Accused’s contention that she was not “Xiao Yu Er” and denying that her voice was the voice in the voice messages sent from the “Xiao Yu Er” account and claiming that somebody else had sent the voice messages, were all bare and unsubstantiated assertions. She was not able to explain who such a person might be and why she would impersonate the Accused on WeChat. The Accused’s postulation that someone may have used a voice imitation function to imitate her voice on the WeChat audio messages was proved baseless when WeChat service providers confirmed that there was no such function on the WeChat messaging application[^65]. The Accused was clearly grasping at straws.

33     On the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Accused was “Xiao Yu Er” and the owner and user of the “Xiao Yu Er” WeChat account.

### Conduct of the Accused demonstrated a consciousness of guilt

34     The conduct of the Accused after she was charged in court was also demonstrative of a consciousness of guilt. PW3 Huang Lifang testified that after their arrest on 16 August 2017, the Accused contacted her and requested Mdm Zeng and her to change their statements to the police and to “mind \[their\] words”. When PW3 Huang Lifang ignored her messages, the Accused threatened to send sexy photographs of her (PW3 Huang Lifang) and the services she provides, to PW3 Huang Lifang’s family. The Accused even went so far as to change her profile picture on her “Xiao Yu Er” WeChat account to PW3 Huang Lifang’s picture and sent messages her sexual services to her friends[^66].

35     On 3 July 2019 when the case was first fixed for trial but vacated, the Accused accosted Mdm Zeng and PW3 Huang Lifang aggressively outside the State Courts of Singapore. PW3 Huang Lifang testified how she witnessed the Accused catching hold of Mdm Zeng’s arm, told them not to leave and asked them to change their statements to the police. The Accused also threatened to inform their families “about what \[they\] have done”. The Accused eventually let them go only after Mdm Zeng took down the Accused’s mobile number in a bid to stop the Accused from pestering them[^67]. Having no reason to doubt the veracity of PW3 Huang Lifang’s account, I found the Accused’s conduct viz-a-viz Mdm Zeng and PW3 Huang Lifang extremely telling of her guilt.

## Women’s Charter Offences proved beyond a reasonable doubt

36     The rental the Accused received from Mdm Zeng may constitute an “inducement” to her (the Accused) providing a service in the form of renting out the room in the unit #XXX to Mdm Zeng. The term “inducement” may be accorded a broad meaning and as submitted by the Prosecution[^68], what acted as the inducement was the gratification itself and need not be inducement as an act of persuasion.

37     I was satisfied that the Accused did know that Mdm Zeng was offering sexual services in the unit #XXX. She knowingly received gratification of $560 on two different occasions i.e. on 1 August 2017 and 8 August 2017, from Mdm Zeng as inducement for renting the room in the unit to her. By doing so, the Accused clearly aided the prostitution of Mdm Zeng.

38     Having assessed the credibility of the Prosecution witnesses and the totality of the evidence presented before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved both the Women’s Charter offences against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the Accused guilty of both the offences under the Women’s Charter and convicted her accordingly.

## Offence under section 39(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code

### Elements of the offence

39     For an offence under section 39(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Prosecution needed to prove the following:-

> (a)     The Accused was a person having charge of a computer[^69] (in this case, the Apple iPhone);

> (b)     PW2 IO Angeline Ng had reasonable cause to suspect that the computer had been used in connection with an arrestable offence; and

> (c)     The Accused failed to comply with PW2 IO Angeline Ng’s requirement for the Accused to provide her password in order to gain access to the phone.

## Prosecution’s evidence relating to the offence under the Criminal Procedure Code

40     For the reasons discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, I was satisfied that the Accused was a person who had control over the operations of the Apple iPhone which was seized from her on 15 August 2017. I also found that PW2 IO Angeline Ng had reasonable cause to suspect that the Apple iPhone had been used in connection with offences under the Women’s Charter since the Accused was arrested for Women’s Charter Offences. She was brought back to Central Police Divisonal Headquarters at No. 391 New Bridge Road for further investigations on that basis.

### Evidence of PW2 IO Angeline Ng

41     As summarized by the Prosecution in their submissions[^70], PW2 IO Angeline Ng’s evidence was that on 17 August 2017 at about 2.50pm, at the lock-up interview room of Central Police Division Headquarters, she suspected that the Phone had been used in connection with Women’s Charter offences, as the Accused had been arrested for Women’s Charter offences[^71]. The physical exhibits seized from the Accused had by this time, been taken over by PW2 IO Angeline Ng[^72].

42     Thereafter, PW2 IO Angeline Ng commenced her investigations and with the Apple iPhone in her hand, she requested for the password to the Apple iPhone from the Accused[^73] a few times in order to unlock the Apple iPhone. However, the Accused denied that the phone belonged to her[^74] and refused to provide her password to unlock the Apple iPhone. The Apple iPhone (as well as the WeChat accounts in the Apple iPhone) was eventually unlocked by the sheer genius of PW8 SI Bryan Ang who was present with PW2 IO Angeline Ng at this stage of the investigations to assist her.

43     The investigative efforts of PW8 SI Bryan Ang on that day were carefully detailed in his investigation diary[^75]. His testimony in court corroborated the evidence of PW2 IO Angeline Ng. He confirmed that the Accused did not provide her password at the material time, when required to do so by PW2 IO Angeline Ng. He stated that that the Accused initially claimed that the Apple iPhone did not belong to her but subsequently looked nervous and broke down when she saw the Apple iPhone being unlocked using a password given by her son[^76].

### Credibility of PW2 IO Angeline Ng and PW8 SI Bryan Ang

44     I accept the evidence of PW2 IO Angeline Ng and PW9 SI Bryan Ang. Both of these officers were unknown to the Accused prior to investigations. They had no reason to falsely incriminate the accused. PW2 IO Angeline Ng confirmed that she had nothing to gain from the prosecution of the Accused, and had conducted her investigations fairly by procuring statements from all parties involved. I found them to be credible witnesses whose evidence corroborated each other in material aspects.

## Accused’s Defence to the charge under the Criminal Procedure Code

45     In court, the Accused claimed that she forgot the password to the Apple iPhone after her arrest. To support her defence, she further asserted that her son had retrieved the password from an unidentified “Auntie” who was beside him, before her son provided the password to the PW8 SI Bryan Ang[^77].

46     I rejected the Accused’s defence for the following reasons:

> (a)     The Accused’s defence that she forgot the password to the Apple iPhone was never raised after her arrest or in the course of investigations. She had ample opportunity for her to state her defence to this charge, including in the police statements recorded from her. However, this was not mentioned at all until in court, almost three years after her arrest. I found this to excuse offered by the Accused to be a clear afterthought;

> (b)     The Accused claimed that “the Auntie” had given her son the password to the Apple iPhone. Again, this was never raised during investigations. In any case, the claim was refuted by the evidence of PW8 SI Bryan Ang who testified that during his second call with the Accused’s son, the Accused’s son provided the password to the Accused’s almost immediately; there was no other party heard in the background.

## Offence under the Criminal Procedure Code proved beyond a reasonable doubt

47     I had no difficulty accepting that the Apple iPhone may be described as a “computer”, based on the definition in section 2(1) of the Computer Misuse Act, Chapter 50A. On the evidence, I found that the Accused not only had charge of the operation of the Apple iPhone; the Apple iPhone actually belonged to her. I was satisfied that the Accused was at all times in a position to provide the password to the Apple iPhone but deliberately failed to comply with the requirement of PW2 IO Angeline Ng in order to prevent her from gaining access to the Apple iPhone and the contents within,

48     The Accused’s defence did not raise any reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s evidence. I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved this charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the Accused guilty on the charge and convicted her accordingly.

## Conclusion

49     Upon conviction, the Accused was sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment on each of the Women’s Charter offences, and 3 weeks’ imprisonment in respect of the offence under section 39(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code. I ordered the sentence in DAC 919605/2018 and DAC 919607/2018 to run consecutively, making it a total sentence of 2 months and 3 weeks’ imprisonment.

50     The sentence was backdated to 23 March 2020. The Accused has completed serving her sentence.
