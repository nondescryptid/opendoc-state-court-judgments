6       He was then brought to Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarter for further investigation.

## Facts relating to LT 1 charge (DAC 926541-2019)

7       Following the arrest, the accused provided two bottles of his urine sample which were marked as “**C-SL-19-00140-1 GOH RONG FONG XXX**” and “**C-SL-1900140-2 GOH RONG FONG XXX**” and sealed **“CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU”** in his presence. On 1 April 2019, the said urine samples were sent to Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

8       On 2 April 2019 and 3 April 2019, analysts of the HSA issued two certificates under Section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), bearing Lab. Nos.: AT-1933-02915-001-03 and AT-1933-02915-002-03 respectively.

> a.     Bellene Chung, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “**C-SL19-00140-1 GOH RONG FONG XXX**” issued the Certificate bearing Lab No: AT-1933-02915-001-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

> b.     Chang Hian Twan, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked “**CSL-19-00140-2 GOH RONG FONG XXX**” issued the Certificate bearing Lab No: AT-1933-02915-002-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

9       Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

10     The accused admitted to the consumption of ‘len de’ (street name for methamphetamine), and said that he had last consumed ‘len de’ on 30 March 2019. The accused used a cut straw to scoop ‘len de’ into the improvised glass pipe, and he then used a lighter to heat up the bottom of the said pipe and inhaled the resulting fumes from an attached rubber tube. The accused felt happy and very relax after smoking ‘len de’. The accused urine samples were therefore found to contain methamphetamine as a result of the accused consuming ‘len de’. The accused had relapsed back to the consumption of methamphetamine sometime in February 2019, and had been smoking methamphetamine on a daily basis for about 5 times a day.

11     The accused is not authorized under MDA or the regulations made thereunder to consume Methamphetamine, a specified drug, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

12     Before the commission of the said offence, the accused was on 07 September 2017 in District Court No. 15, vide DAC0906914/2017, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, Methamphetamine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and punished under Section 33(1) of the said Act with 10 months’ imprisonment, and was on 20 October 2017, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under s 34(2)(b) of the MDA, admitted to an approved institution, namely, Changi Drug Rehabilitation Centre, for the consumption of a specified drug, to wit, Methamphetamine, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and he shall now be punished under s 33A(1) of the MDA.

## Facts relating to enhanced possession charge (DAC 934269-2019)

13     The exhibit marked “GRF-C” and “GRF-D” were sealed in tamper proof bags and sent to HSA for analysis on 2 April 2019.

14     On 9 May 2019, Dr. Zhang Shuhua, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the the HSA, issued the following certificates under Section 16 of the MDA bearing the following Lab. No.:

> a.     Lab No. ID-1932-00675-001, pertaining to the exhibit marked “GRF-C”. The exhibit was found to be one (01) packet containing not less than 13.62 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 9.26 grams of methamphetamine.

> b.     Lab. No. ID-1932-00675-002, pertaining to the exhibit marked “GRF-D”. The exhibit was found to be five (05) packets containing not less than 24.89 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 16.92 grams of methamphetamine.

15     Collectively, the exhibits marked “GRF-C” and “GRF-D” were therefore a total of six (06) packets containing a total of not less than 38.51 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain a total of not less than 26.18 grams of Methamphetamine.

16     Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the Frist Schedule to the MDA.

17     The accused admitted to ownership and possession of the exhibits marked “GRF-C” and “GRF-D” – according to him, they were meant for his own consumption. The accused states that these exhibits were ‘len de’, and that the quantity of ‘len de’ in exhibit “GRF-C” were his leftovers from his consumption of ‘len de’ on 30 March 2019. The accused purchased the drugs found on him using the money he had won from gambling.

18     The accused is not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to have in his possession a Controlled Drug and he has thereby committed an offence under Sec 8(a) of the MDA.

19     Before the commission of the said offence, the accused was convicted on 07 September 2017 in the District Court No. 15, vide DAC0906915/2017, for the offence of Possession of a Controlled Drug, to wit, methamphetamine, under Section 8(a) of the MDA, and sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment, which conviction has not been set aside, and the accused is thereby liable for enhanced punishment under Section 33(1) of MDA.

## Facts relating to failure to report for urine test (DAC 934722-2019)

20     The accused was placed on compulsory supervision for a period of 24 months under a Supervision Order issued under Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“**The Regulations**”) with effect from 3 May 2019.

21     Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Regulations, the accused was required to present himself at Jurong Police Divisional HQ for a urine test every Monday and Thursday of each month commencing on 6 May 2019 during his supervision, that is from 3 May 2019 to 2 May 2021, except for Public Holidays. However, whilst on agency bail, the accused had failed to report for any of his urine tests from the period starting 6 May 2019 to 16 September 2019. He was eventually arrested on 18 September 2019 by CNB officers at his mother’s residence in Singapore for failing to report for urine tests. In total, the accused failed to report for his urine test on 39 occasions.

22     According to the accused, he knew he was required to present himself for regular urine tests, but he chose not to attend because he did not feel the need to do so.

23     The accused contravened the said Regulations when he failed to present himself for urine test on 9 September 2019 (Monday) without any valid reasons or medical certificates. He has thereby committed an offence under Reg 15(3)(f) read with Reg 15(6)(a) of the Regulations.

## Facts relating to failure to report to approved institution (DAC 934276-2019)

24     On 21 November 2018, the Superintendent of Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre (LLCSC) granted the accused Notice of Leave to participate in the Halfway House Programme at Teen Challenge Halfway House under Regulation 12(1) of the Regulations. He was emplaced on the said programme for the period from 28 November 2018 to 3 May 2019.

25     Investigation revealed that, on 27 March 2019 at about 4.16pm, the accused had left Teen Challenge Halfway House without authorisation. The accused had left the Halfway House. Calls were made to the accused’s family members but they were unaware of the accused’s whereabouts.

26     On 28 March 2019, the Superintendent of LLCSC cancelled the Notice of Leave, which required the accused to return to the said institution. A police gazette was issued for his arrest and he remained absent until he was arrested on 30 March 2019. The accused had therefore committed an offence punishable under Regulation 12(5) of the Regulations for failing to return to the approved institution after leave granted to him was cancelled.

## TIC charges

27     A total of five charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The TIC charges have been set out in the table \[at para 2\].

## Antecedents

28     The accused is traced for the following relevant antecedents:

29     He was convicted on 7 September 2017 for an offence of consumption of a controlled drug under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA where he was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment. He was admitted on 20 October 2017 to an approved institution pursuant to an order under s 34(2)(b) MDA for consumption of methamphetamine. These two antecedents formed the basis of the LT1 charge.

30     He was convicted on 7 September 2017 for an offence of possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the MDA where he was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment which formed the basis of the enhanced possession charges proceeded and taken into consideration. One charge of possession of utensils intended for the consumption of a controlled drug under s 9 p/u sec 33(1) MDA was taken into consideration with the 2017 possession conviction for the purposes of sentencing.

31     On 3 May 2019 he was placed under drug supervision for 24 months for consumption of a controlled drug. It was during this regime that gave rise to the FRUT charge that was proceeded on and the 2 other FRUT charges that were taken into consideration for sentencing.

32     The accused is also traced for unrelated offences of extortion, moneylending, theft, making of harassing/obscene telephone calls and customs offences.

## Prosecution’s submission on sentence

33     For the LT1 consumption charge, the prosecution sought the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. For the enhanced possession charge the prosecution sought an uplift to 3 years’ imprisonment from the mandatory minimum 2 years’ imprisonment term in view of two other enhanced possession charges which were taken into consideration which involved other types of drugs namely Ketamine and MDMA as well as the significant amount of methamphetamine in the proceeded charge.

34     For the Failure to Report for Urine Test charge (FRUT) the prosecution sought a term of 7 months’ imprisonment as this was committed on bail and there were also other FRUT charges which were taken into consideration. For the Failure to report to back to an approved institution, the prosecution sought a term of 3 months’ imprisonment.

35     The prosecution asked for imprisonment terms for the LT1, FRUT and failure to report to an approved institution terms of imprisonment to be consecutive, which would result in a global sentence of 5 years, 10 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

## Mitigation plea

36     In mitigation, defence counsel said that the accused had pleaded guilty and co-operated with the authorities. He regrets the commission of offences and had admitted to his wrongdoing. The accused has been a heavy consumer of drugs since 2016, mainly methamphetamine and consumes about 3-4g of methamphetamine a day. He also takes MDMA (Ecstasy) and Ketamine.

37     As for the circumstances surrounding the offences, the accused said that he gotten the drugs from his friend. They were the left-overs which his close friend had passed to him. His friend had also been arrested. The drugs were for his own consumption. He was addicted to drugs and would finish the drugs within a few days. He had failed to report for his urine test as he was on drugs. The enhanced possession charge had been reduced by the prosecution from the original charge of possession for the purposes of trafficking.

38     The accused also tendered a written mitigation where he said _inter alia_ that his previous conviction for consumption was committed when his friends asked him to do it and it was these compulsive behaviours which led him to keep doing what his friends asked him to do. He said that on the day of his arrest, he went to the police expecting help and rehabilitation but was instead arrested. He had cooperated with the investigating officer which led to several high profile arrests. He also said that he suffered from bouts of anxiety depression and paranoia.

39     Before me, defence counsel said that the prosecution’s submission for a global sentence of 5 years 10 months and 3 strokes of the cane was “fair” and asked for it to be backdated to the date of remand (20 September 2019).

## Individual sentences

40     For the LT1 charge, I sentenced the accused to the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. This was in line with what the prosecution and defence had asked for.

41     For the enhanced possession charge involving possession of methamphetamine, the mandatory minimum sentence was 2 years’ imprisonment, with a maximum of term of 10 years’ imprisonment. The accused had two other TIC charges for enhanced possession of MDMA (Ecstasy) and Ketamine respectively.

42     In _Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span>, the Court of Appeal held \[at para 64\] while a court is not bound to increase a sentence merely because there are TIC offences, it will normally do so where the TIC offences are of a similar nature. I agreed with the prosecution that an uplift was justified in view of the 2 TIC enhanced possession charges for different types of controlled drugs (MDMA and Ketamine) and accordingly sentenced him to 3 years’ imprisonment. Having said that, this term of 3 years’ imprisonment for the enhanced possession charge did not, in the final analysis, affect the global sentence as it was made to run concurrently with the sentence on the LT1 charge of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

43     The FRUT charge was committed while on bail and the circumstances are set out in the Statement of Facts as follows:

> **However, whilst on agency bail, the accused had failed to report for any of his urine tests from the period starting 6 May 2019 to 16 September 2019**. He was eventually arrested on 18 September 2019 by CNB officers at his mother’s residence in Singapore for failing to report for urine tests. In total, the accused failed to report for his urine test on 39 occasions. \[emphasis mine\]

44     In _Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR 753</span>, V K Rajah JA observed \[at para 57\] that the commission of an offence whilst on bail for another, is itself an aggravating factor and “squarely and directly engages the two facets of deterrence.” In _Loo Pei Xiang Alan_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 217</span>, Chao JA observed \[at para 29\] that a good reason for elevating a sentence beyond its starting point is that the offences were committed while on bail which “demonstrates a disregard for law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention.”

45     In the present case, the aggravating factor for the FRUT offence was that it was committed while on bail for drug related charges. There were also two FRUT charges taken into consideration. The accused’s culpability and cavalier disregard for the drug supervision regime (of which urine testing was an integral part) was reflected in the Statement of Facts as follows:

> **According to the accused, he knew he was required to present himself for regular urine tests, but he chose not to attend because he did not feel the need to do so**. \[emphasis mine\]

46     In the State Courts Sentencing Information and Research Repository (SIRR), for FRUT cases where the accused has pleaded guilty, the mean, median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile sentences were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="22.4844968993799%"> <col width="25.9251850370074%"> <col width="26.5653130626125%"> <col width="25.0250050010002%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Mean</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Median</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25<sup>th</sup> percentile</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">75 percentile</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28.6 weeks</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(6.6 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25.7 weeks</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(5.9 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">21.4 weeks</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(4.9 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">34.3 weeks</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(7.9 months)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

47     For the reasons set out above, I agreed with the prosecution that an uplift from the usual range of sentences imposed for such offences was justified and imposed a sentence of 7 months’ for the FRUT charge.

48     In the SIRR, for failure to report back to an approved institution offences where the accused had pleaded guilty, the mean, median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile sentences were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="23.5152969406119%"> <col width="24.8150369926015%"> <col width="25.4149170165967%"> <col width="26.25474905019%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Mean</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Median</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25<sup>th</sup> percentile</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">75 percentile</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16.4 weeks</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(3.8 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17.1 weeks</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(3.9 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12.9 weeks</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(2.9 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17.1 weeks</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(3.9 months)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

49     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission for a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment as this was in line with the usual range of sentences imposed for such offences and sentenced him to 3 months’ imprisonment for failure to report back to an approved institution.

## Consecutive sentences

50     The accused faced a total of 4 charges for which he had been sentenced to imprisonment. In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> Menon CJ observed \[at para 41\] that

> As a general rule, a multiple offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.

51     The learned Chief Justice further noted \[at para 43\] that

> In many situations, concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would not adequately serve, and in fact may undermine, the sentencing considerations that underlie the individual sentences comprising the aggregate term. For one thing, the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would afford an offender who has already committed an offence less or no real incentive to refrain from committing a further offence, in so far as such a sentencing position would result in the offender not having to bear any real consequence for the further offending. This creates a distorted incentive that detracts from the deterrent value of the individual sentences notionally imposed.

52     Section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that where there are three or more distinct offences for which the accused has been sentenced to imprisonment (as in the present case), at least two sentences of imprisonment are to be consecutive. Menon CJ explained the operation of s 307(1) CPC and consecutive sentences in _Raveen Balakrishnan_ \[at para 52\] as follows:

> The general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences does not contravene s 307(1) or render it otiose. The provision retains its relevance in that it operates regardless of whether the multiple offences are related or otherwise. Therefore, even if all or some of the offences are related, s 307(1) applies to require that at least two sentences should run consecutively. Indeed, in my judgment, s 307(1) of the CPC, the one transaction rule, and the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences should be regarded as complementary principles that collectively help a court decide how sentences should be ordered to run in relation to a multiple offender.

53     On what amounts to an “unrelated offence”, Menon CJ observed \[at para 69\] that

> ...to say that two offences are “unrelated” means that they are _not_ “part of a single transaction”; conversely, to describe them as “part of a single transaction” means they are _not_ “unrelated”. The two inquiries are two sides of the same coin.

54     In _Mohammed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> Menon CJ observed \[at para 30\] that “the better articulation of the rationale for the rule is found in the principle that consecutive sentences are not appropriate if the various offences involve a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest” and explained further \[at para 31\] that “the real basis of the one-transaction rule is unity of the violated interest that underlies the various offences.”

55     The learned Chief Justice highlighted that there were exceptions to the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences. For our purposes, the relevant exceptions are first, the totality principle and second, that the general rule of consecutive offences is not mandatory but if a court consciously chooses not to run the sentences consecutively it needs to explain its reasons.

56     While there is no rule under s 307(1) requiring the most severe sentence to be the one which is selected to run consecutive with the others, the aggregate sentence must exceed the longest individual sentence- see _Shouffee_ \[at para 77\].

57     In the present case, I have sentenced the accused to the mandatory minimum term of 5 years and 3 strokes of the cane on the LT1 charge which is the longest individual sentence. As the aggregate of the other three charges (3 years + 7 months + 3 months) would not exceed the sentence on the LT1 charge, the sentence on the LT1 charge must therefore be one of the sentences that runs consecutive with the others.

58     From 28 November 2018 to 3 May 2019, the Superintendent of Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre (LLCSC) granted the accused Notice of Leave to participate in the Halfway House Programme at Teen Challenge Halfway House from which the failure to return to an approved institution charge arose when the accused left the approved institution on 27 March 2019. The accused’s leave was then cancelled by the Superintendent of LLCSC on 28 March 2019.

59     The FRUT charges arose out of the accused being subject to drug supervision and urine testing from 3 May 2019. The FRUT charge was committed on 9 September 2019 while on bail for the LT1 and enhanced possession charges (which were committed on 30 March 2019).

60     Chronologically, the failure to return to an approved institution was committed first, followed by the LT1 and enhanced possession charge and then the FRUT charge. In my view, the FRUT charge and the failure to report to an approved institution charge bookended the LT1 and enhanced possession charge as distinct and unrelated offences. They arose in the context of different regimes during different time periods and were therefore neither proximate in time nor type (per _PP v Law Aik Meng_ \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 814 \[at para 52\]). As they were not part of the same transaction, the sentences on the FRUT charge and the failure to report to an approved institution charge should run consecutive to the LT1 charge.

61     As for the enhanced possession charge, the Statement of Facts stated that the methamphetamine found on him on 30 March 2019 were for his own consumption. His urine sample subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine which resulted in the LT1 charge. It is therefore arguable that the LT1 charge and enhanced possession charge are part of the same transaction since the accused possessed the drugs for his own consumption.

62     In any event, given that the statutory framework under the MDA already provides for mandatory minimum sentences for the LT1 (5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane) and enhanced possession charges (2 years’ imprisonment), on the basis of totality principle and to avoid a crushing sentence, the prosecution quite rightly did not submit (with which I concurred) that the sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment on the enhanced possession charge sentence should run consecutively with the other charges and I accordingly ordered it to run concurrently with other terms of imprisonment.

## Conclusion

63     In conclusion, the respective sentences are summarised as follows:

> **\*sentences to be consecutive**

64     The sentences in s/nos 1, 5 and 9 to run consecutively and the sentence in s/no 2 is to run concurrently leading to a global sentence of 5 years, 10 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. The sentence was backdated to the date of remand, namely 20 September 2019.

65     In line with the totality principle in _Kanagasuntharam v PP_ \[1991\] 2 SLR (R) 782 \[at para 13\], the total sentence of 5 years, 10 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane is far from the normal level of sentence for the most serious of the individual offences (the enhanced possession charge attracted a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment). Ultimately, the global sentence of 5 years 10 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was in line with what the prosecution and defence counsel had submitted before me.

66     The accused is currently serving sentence.
