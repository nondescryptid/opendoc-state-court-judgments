### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

The accused, a 26-year old first offender, pleaded guilty to two counts of theft, both of which were committed in furtherance of the common intention with one Yap Bee Pin (namely, the accused’s mother), which offences are punishable under section 379 read with section 34 of the Penal Code Cap 224 (“PC”). These respective charges relate to the theft of camera lenses, valued at $4,237 and that of two cameras valued at $9,298. Two other charges, namely, theft of comic books valued at $104 (section 379 read with section 34 PC) and theft of an iPhone charging cable valued at $20 (section 379 PC) were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing. At the material time when the offences were committed, the accused was 22 years old.

2       I sentenced the accused to a community sentence comprising of a short detention order (“SDO”) of ten days, a Day Reporting Order (“DRO”) for a period of 12 months and a Community Service Order (“CSO”) where the accused was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. Under the DRO, the accused was further ordered to comply with the following conditions during the said period:

> a)     To remain indoors from 10.00pm till 6.00am;

> b)     To be placed on the Electronic Monitoring Scheme for a period of 6 months;

> c)     To undergo psychiatric treatment; and

> d)     To undergo counselling at WE CARE Community Services (“WE CARE”).

3       Both the prosecution and the defence has since filed Notices of Appeal against the sentence. The defence had clarified that the appeal against sentence was only in relation to the SDO. As such, the defence applied for a stay of execution of the community sentence imposed (including the DRO and CSO as well), which I duly granted. The accused is currently on bail pending the appeal.

## Charges

4       For ease of reference, the proceeded charges are as follows:

> DAC 931423/2017

> You, Malvin Ng Yi Lun, are charged that you, on 20 October 2015, at or about 4.18pm, at the “Sony” shop located at 313 Somerset #02-28, No. 313 Orchard Road, Singapore 238895, together with one Yap Bee Pin, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did commit theft of the following three items:

>> (a)    One Sony Lens, model SEL35F14Z FE35mm, valued at S$2269/-;

>> (b)    One Sony Lens, model SEL28F20 FE28mm, valued at S$619/-; and

>> (c)    One Sony Lens, model SEL55F18Z, valued at S$1349/-,

>> with a total value of S$4,237/-, in the possession of the assistant store manager, one Ng Chuai Woon, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 379 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> DAC 931424/2017

> You, Malvin Ng Yi Lun, are charged that you, on 16 December 2015, at or about 7.30pm, at the “Sony” shop located at 313 Somerset #02-28, No. 313 Orchard Road, Singapore 238895, together with one Yap Bee Pin, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did commit theft of the following two items:

>> (a)    One Sony Cyber-shot, model RX1R II, black colour, valued at S$4999/-; and

>> (b)    One Sony Alpha, model 7S II, black colour, valued at S$4299/-,

> with a total value of S$9,298/-, in the possession of the assistant store manager, one Pyae Phone Htoo, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 379 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Summary of Facts

5       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) pertaining to the above proceeded charges, without qualification. The salient points are as follows:

> DAC 931423/2017

> (a)     The co-accused, Mdm Yap Bee Pin (“Yap”), 51 years old, is the accused’s mother. The complainant was the assistant store manager at the “Sony” shop (“store”).

> (b)     On 20 October 2015, at about 5.00pm, the complainant was alerted by her staff that there were three camera lenses missing from the display shelves of the store. The closed-circuit television (“CCTV”) footage revealed that both accused persons entered the store at about 4.18pm.

> (c)     Investigations revealed that prior to the commission of the theft on 20 October 2015, the accused had asked Yap to accompany him to the store as he wanted ‘to try out’ the camera lenses (“lenses”). Whilst in the store, the accused formed the dishonest intention to commit theft and removed three camera lenses with a total value of $4,237, from the store’s display shelves.

> (d)     The accused took the lenses and walked towards the back of the shelves, pulling out the security tags, which were each secured by a cable-tie, and discarding them. The accused then walked to Yap and placed the stolen lenses into the plastic carrier, which was held by Yap. The accused informed Yap that he was stealing the lenses. Yap (who was then carrying the plastic carrier bag containing the stolen lenses) and the accused then left the store together without making payment for the lenses.

> DAC 931424/2017

> (e)     Investigations revealed that on 16 December 2015, the accused knew that there were new camera models launched at the store. He asked Yap and his sister to accompany him to the said store. Before they left for the store, the accused informed Yap that he planned to steal some cameras from the store should the opportunity subsequently arise.

> (f)     On the same day at about 7.30pm, the accused, his sister and Yap arrived at the store and proceeded to the “New Arrivals” section. The accused removed two cameras, valued at $9,298, from the store’s display shelves.

> (g)     The accused then approached Yap and placed the stolen cameras into the plastic carrier, which was being held by Yap at the material time. Yap then left the store with the stolen cameras without making payment for them. The accused left the store shortly thereafter.

> (h)     On 19 September 2016, the accused and Yap proceeded to the said store and were spotted by employees. At about 8.50pm, they were arrested by the police.

> (i)     The above stolen lenses and cameras were subsequently recovered from the accused’s residence.

## Prosecution’s Submissions

6       The prosecution sought for a global sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment. The following aggravating factors were highlighted in support of a custodial sentence to be imposed:

> a)     In relation to the charge of theft of cameras, there was a certain degree of premeditation where the accused had informed his mother (namely, Yap) that he planned to steal some cameras from the store should the opportunity arise;

> b)     The accused stole the two cameras and three camera lenses out of greed. He clearly had an interest in cameras and photography where he initially went to the store in October 2015 because he wanted to try out its camera lenses, and went back to the same store in December 2015, as he knew that there were new camera models being launched.

> c)     The total value of the stolen items in respect of all four charges (including TIC charges) is high, namely, $13,659.

> d)     The accused committed four theft offences over a span of eleven months – on 20 Oct 2015, 16 Dec 2015, July 2016 and 13 Sep 2016 -- stealing items valued at $4,237, $9,298, $104 and $20 respectively. It was submitted that this demonstrates his propensity to re-offend and a progressive proclivity towards property offences.

7       The accused was 22 years and 11 months old on the day that he committed the first offence. He was 26 years and 6 months old at the time he was sentenced. As such, it was submitted that the presumption that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing objective for young offenders was thus not applicable.

8       Whilst the TIC charges relate to offences which the accused had readily admitted to (without the need for police investigations), little credit should however, be given to the accused. This was because the total value of the stolen items for these two charges are trivial (i.e. $124) as compared to the total value of the stolen items for the proceeded charges (i.e. $13,535).

9       Little to no weight ought to be placed on the accused’s plea of guilt, in view of the circumstances of his arrest. The offences only came to light when the employees of the store spotted the accused in September 2016 and not as a result of the accused voluntarily surrendering himself to the police.

10     In light of the above, the prosecution submitted that deterrence and retribution ought to outweigh the accused’s need for rehabilitation.

## Mitigation

11     It was the defence’s case that despite being caught months after committing the theft offences, the accused had readily admitted to them in his statements to the police. He had further informed the authorities that the stolen items (namely, the cameras and lenses) were in his residence, where they were voluntarily surrendered to the police. He had also handed over other stolen items (namely, the comic books still sealed in their clear plastic packaging[^1] and one iPhone charging cable), which were not being investigated by the police and which were the subject matter of the TIC charges. It was further submitted that the accused’s early plea of guilt, his lack of antecedents, genuine remorse as well as the fact that he had not re-offended for the past three years (after he was apprehended), ought to be given full weight. Further, the accused had also since sought treatment ‘for his underlying psychiatric disorder to address his depression and acting out behaviour[^2]’.

12     Since his arrest in September 2016, the accused had focused on his studies and attained a diploma in banking and finance from the Singapore Institute of Management (“SIM”). Throughout his education journey in SIM, the accused has been candid about the prosecution against him, both to his educators and to his fellow students. He expressed deep remorse for his actions when he reflected upon what had transpired.

13     The accused did extremely well for his academic studies and eventually graduated top of his cohort for the diploma course, bagging the Mapletree Gold Award as well as attaining a perfect 4.0 CGPA (“Cumulative Grade Point Average”). Since 2 January 2019, the accused has commenced his university studies for a Bachelor of Computer Science (Cyber Security) to be awarded by the University of Wollongong at SIM[^3].

14     In reply to prosecution’s submissions, the defence submitted that in relation to the theft of cameras, there was no premeditation as the accused did not plan and execute an elaborate heist to steal the cameras as he merely told his mother (Yap) before going to the store that he would only take the cameras ‘should the opportunity subsequently arise’. It was thus ‘largely an opportunistic and crudely planned theft’.

15     It was further disputed by the defence that the accused had stolen the items ‘out of greed’, especially since it was not mentioned in the SOF. The prosecution had relied on the following agreed facts to demonstrate a motive of greed, which the defence submitted that they (either jointly or by themselves) do not lead to the irresistible inference that the accused had done so:

> a)     The accused had asked Yap to accompany him to go to the store as he wanted to try out camera lenses.

> b)     The accused knew that there were new camera models being launched at the store and asked Yap and his sister to accompany him there[^4].

16     Given the accused’s resolve to mend his ways, his strong propensity to reform by focusing and excelling in his studies, as well as proactively seeking treatment for his underlying psychiatric disorders (namely, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) which the accused was suffering from at the material time[^5]), the defence submitted that rehabilitation ought to be the dominant sentencing consideration. The accused had further demonstrated his ability to act honestly when he returned lost items to the police in April 2018[^6]. In view of the above, a probation order or a community sentence under section 337 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), specifically, any of the following or combination orders of either a DRO and/or CSO, should thus be considered.

17     Additionally, it was submitted that an imprisonment term would be inappropriate in view of the following mitigating factors:

> a)     The accused’s unconditional co-operation with the authorities;

> b)     The accused’s willingness to pay compensation for any loss suffered by the victims during the period of the items’ detention by him, which offer has been communicated to the State in writing;

> c)     In respect of the first charge, the accused had ‘impulsively decided to steal the lenses while shopping with his mother at the Sony store. He did not bother keeping a lookout and simply removed the security tags’;

> d)     The second charge was ‘essentially an opportunistic crime’ as the accused ‘did not plan and execute an elaborate heist in order to steal those cameras; this is confirmed by his crude _modus operandi_: he simply took the cameras and placed them in his mother’s bag’.

18     Furthermore, a jail term would be a ‘manifestly excessive punishment to be visited upon one who has actively sought to rehabilitate himself, and by all accounts, has succeeded in doing so’. The defence submitted that the accused’s positive progress since his arrest (in 2016), to date (in 2019) should not be lightly disregarded. Citing the High Court decision in _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_Karthik_”) at \[55\], Menon CJ explained that the Court could use :

> ….the opportunity afforded by the delay in prosecution to examine the evidence of the Appellant’s rehabilitative progress between the time of his offences and the time of his sentencing so as to determine whether it would be appropriate, on the particular facts of this case, to maintain the focus on rehabilitation as the key sentencing consideration.

19     It was submitted that the above principle is applicable beyond the context of the typical ‘youthful offender’ (namely, those aged 21 years old and below), as confirmed by the case of _Chan Kum Hong Randy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 1019</span> (“_Randy Chan_”), which involved an accused person far older than 21 years old, where there was an inordinate delay between the commission of the offence and the ultimate disposition of the case. The defence had submitted that although the accused was arrested on 19 September 2016, formal charges were only preferred against him almost one year later on 31 August 2017. Thereafter, any subsequent delay was not due to the defence. In _Randy Chan’s_ case, the Honourable VK Rajah JA, noted as follows at \[29\]:

> In cases involving an inordinate delay between the commission of an offence and the ultimate disposition of that offence via the criminal justice process, the element of rehabilitation underway during the interim cannot be lightly dismissed or cursorily overlooked. If the rehabilitation of the offender has progressed positively since his commission of the offence and there appears to be a real prospect that he may, with time, be fully rehabilitated, this is a vital factor that must be given due weight and properly reflected in the sentence which is ultimately imposed on him. Indeed, in appropriate cases, this might warrant a sentence that might otherwise be viewed as “a quite undue degree of leniency”…

20     It was further contended by the defence that imposing an imprisonment term ‘might jeopardise any progress that has been made in his recovery to date’. Both the accused’s psychiatrist and psychologist, namely, Dr Munidasa Winslow and Mr Cheoh Yen Han, respectively, have advised in their report (“Dr Winslow’s report”), that the accused be allowed to continue his treatment in the community to ensure that similar lapses do not occur in future[^7]. In the same report, it was stated that the accused has been regular in following up with his treatment and has also been attending psychotherapy sessions at WE CARE regularly to help him cope with his emotional issues. It was thus submitted that society gains nothing by sending a bright young man who has demonstrated a strong propensity for reform to jail, at the risk of crippling him mentally.

21     The aims of a custodial sentence, namely, deterrence, prevention and retribution, ought to be evaluated in the following light[^8]:

> a)     Deterrence – Parliament, by legislatively qualifying section 379 PC offences for community sentences, has signaled that rehabilitation ought to play a more domination role in sentencing, and that by their very nature, such offences are not crimes that are so heinous as to warrant punishment that reflects general deterrence.

> b)     Prevention – the arrest and prosecution alone of the current offences have had an indelible effect on the accused. By all accounts and the written testimonies of those who have educated him for the past 1.5 years, the accused has truly reformed himself and has not re-offended since his arrest and is unlikely to do so in future.

> c)     Retribution – all stolen items have been fully recovered and the accused was also prepared to make further compensation. No physical harm had resulted either. It cannot be said that the offences committed by the accused are ‘so socially abhorrent that a pound of flesh must be extracted before it can be said that justice has been served’.

22     Should the accused be sentenced to an imprisonment term, it would ‘reinforce the notion that nothing he can do will redeem him in society’s eyes’ as his efforts at restitution and rehabilitation would have been ‘pointless’.

23     Jailing the accused would also result in an unspent conviction and a criminal record for a crime of dishonesty. It was submitted that this would severely affect his ability to travel, to seek further education and to obtain future employment. These consequences would be disproportionately harsh for a young man who is about to start his career and his past mistakes ought not to cripple him for life, especially when he has painstakingly committed himself to a path of reform[^9].

## The Reports

24     I called for both the DRO suitability (“DRO report”) and CSO suitability reports (“CSO report”) but not a probation suitability report and the reasons for doing so, would be elaborated in detail below. The accused was found suitable for both DRO and CSO.

## Parties’ further submissions

25     It was further submitted by the prosecution that although the accused was found suitable for both the CSO and DRO, community-based sentences (“CBS”) would not be appropriate in the current case given that there was ‘nothing unusual or exceptional’ which indicated that the accused had a strong potential for rehabilitation and reintegration into society.

26     The prosecution further highlighted the risk factors stated in the DRO report, which included the accused’s ‘thinking supportive of crime’, his distant relationship with his father and sister, his lack of employment and lack of peer support (where the accused had self-reported that he had difficulty making friends).

27     Whilst the CSO report found the accused to be suitable for community service, it also stated that the accused was willing to be placed on CSO as he wanted to avoid serving an imprisonment term.

28     In response to defence counsel’s mitigation that the accused’s progress to date in addressing the ‘underlying issues associated with his depression and acting out behaviours’, might be jeopardised with an imprisonment term, the prosecution submitted that the the offender’s ill-health is only relevant in two ways: either as a ground for the exercise of judicial mercy, or as a mitigating factor where a jail term may cause disproportionate impact on the offender (see _PP v Chua Siew Peng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 128</span> (“_Chua Siew Peng_”) at \[100\]).

29     The High Court in _Chua Siew Peng_ observed that judicial mercy is an ‘exceptional jurisdiction’, only to be exercised in cases where the offender is suffering from a terminal illness or when a custodial term would endanger the offender’s life (at \[101\]). These grounds were clearly inapplicable in the present case, as the accused was not suffering from a terminal illness and neither was there any evidence to suggest that prison environment will endanger the accused’s life.

30     It was further highlighted by the prosecution that a custodial sentence would not have a ‘disproportionate impact’ on the accused given that Dr Winslow’s report states that imprisonment ‘_might_’ jeopardise any progress that has been made to the accused’s recovery to date. It was thus submitted that this did not appear to suggest that there was a ‘risk of significant deterioration in health or a significant exacerbation of pain and suffering’ (see _Chua Siew Peng_ at \[102\]). The prosecution further confirmed that the Prisons would be able to manage the accused’s psychiatric condition, should he be sentenced to an imprisonment term.

31     The defence on the other hand, countered prosecution’s submissions in relation to the DRO report, as follows[^10]:

> a)     Thinking supportive of crime – this would be inherent in anyone who has been convicted of an offence and ought not to be held against him. The accused had since remained crime-free for the last three years which evinces the fact he no longer has such thinking.

> b)     Distant relationship with his father and sister – this was at the time of the commission of the offences, three years ago. His sister has since commenced university studies and is living at home with the accused. His father is also his bailor. Both the accused’s father and sister have also been attending the court hearings to support the accused. There is thus no doubt that he has strong familial support.

> c)     Lack of employment – the accused cannot be faulted for being a student at the material time and thus ‘unemployed’. He has done incredibly well at SIM and graduated at the top of his cohort and is currently a full-time student at university and will undoubtedly join the workforce after graduation.

> d)     Lack of peer support – this was at the material time which was three years ago. However, his lecturers at SIM have variously described him as ‘_diligent, articulate and well liked by his peers_’; ‘_works well with his project partners and gets along well with his classmates_’; ‘_Malvin’s positive attitude, interpersonal skills, determination and strong sense of purpose will stand him in good stead_’; Two of his friends, Mohamed Corleon Bin Mohamed Nasir and Wong Weng Wou have signed written testimonies in support of the accused. His interpersonal skills have clearly improved and he now has greater peer support.

32     It was inaccurate for the prosecution to suggest that the only reason the accused is willing to perform community service is because he wants to avoid going to jail. The CSO report also stated that the accused hoped to ‘pay back to the society for his mistake’ and that he was willing to comply with the conditions of the CSO and is aware of the consequences should he fail to perform community service as required. It was submitted that the accused’s concerns over the impact of a jail term on his future prospects are also perfectly understandable and there was nothing to suggest that the accused would not comply with the CSO[^11].

33     The academic references by the accused’s lecturers remain highly credible and relevant. They were made by lecturers wholly unconnected to the case who had absolutely no incentive to go out of their way to paint a good picture of the accused. Their observations were made as a result of spending a significant period of time observing him. Their assessment that the accused ‘is a credit to society ought not to be lightly dismissed[^12]’.

## Decision of the court

#### The rationale for community-based sentences

34     The rationale for CBS options is explained in the introductory speech of the Minister of Law, Mr K Shanmugam, at the second reading of the Criminal Procedure Code Bill (Bill 11 of 2010) (“CPC Bill 2010”) (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 422 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs)):

> CBS gives more flexibility to the Courts. Not every offender should be put in prison. CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the Court to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum: regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions. For such cases, it is appropriate to harness the resources of the community. The offender remains gainfully employed and his family benefit from the focused treatment.

35     As noted by See Kee Oon J in the cases of _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span> (“_Sim Wen Yi Ernest_”) (at \[33\]) and _PP v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 315</span> (“_Teo Chang Heng_”) (at \[12\]) and with reference to the Minister’s statement above:

> …CBS options were introduced to allow greater flexibility in balancing the various sentencing principles in _individual cases._ The primary focus of CBS is rehabilitative and the above passage should be understood in that context. The Minister’s statement makes it clear that not every offender should be imprisoned and community resources should be harnessed in appropriate cases. However, the palette of CBS options also caters for cases which call for short imprisonment terms in the form of SDOs, which are “less disruptive and stigmatising than a longer prison stay” (at col 426). Such cases are not premised purely on a rehabilitative philosophy involving community resources. Moreover, combinations of CBS options can be considered.

36     I am also mindful of the observations made by VK Rajah JA in the case of _Kalaiarasi d/o Marimuthu Innasimuthu v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 774</span> (“_Kalaiarasi_”) at \[36\]:

> The focus of community-based sentencing is on the individual offender (see Melanie Chng, “Modernising the Criminal Justice Framework: The Criminal Procedure Code 2010”) (2011 23 SAcL 23 (_Chng_ at para. 43). The objective is to identify and address the “root causes” of the offending behaviour (_Chng_ at para. 43). Although the focus is on the individual, community-based sentencing also promotes the interest of the public because by correcting and rehabilitating offenders, recidivism will be reduced (_Chng_ at para. 44).

37     In determining the suitability of the various types of community or CBS orders, much would depend on the relevant circumstances of the offender and the type of offence and in this regard, See J in _Sim Wen Yi Ernest_ at \[40\] and \[41\], had this to say:

> ….This calls for an open-textured assessment that is highly contextualised and the court must have regard to all the facts of the case. Some types of CBS may have greater relevance in the cases which involve youthful offenders since such offenders are often seen to have greater rehabilitative capacity. Nevertheless, I did not think that offenders above the age of 21 should _ipso facto_ be denied the opportunity to be considered for CBS. The rehabilitative aim does not automatically recede into the background once the offender reaches 21 years of age. In every case, the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender in question must be carefully scrutinised and evaluated to determine whether rehabilitation should be given prominence notwithstanding any countervailing need for deterrence, retribution or prevention: _Kalaiarasi_ (at \[39\]). Thus, the appropriateness of CBS is a question which turns on all the relevant circumstances of each case, including the offence and offender in question.

> This approach is consistent with ss 346 and 348 of the CPC which provide that persons above 16 years of age can be considered for CSO and SDOs respectively; the provisions do not restrict the imposition of such orders to offenders below the age of 21. It is also in line with the broad policy objective that undergirds the CBS framework, that is, **to enable offenders of less serious crimes to be dealt with in ways other than by imposing fines or imprisonment to enhance their chances of rehabilitation without diluting the deterrent objective of our penal regime or jeopardising the public’s sense of safety** (_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts Volume 1_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_”) at p 77).

38     With these sentencing considerations in mind, I now turn to the specifc factual matrix of the present case.

39     I am cognisant of the aggravating factors which were highlighted by the prosecution, which include the high value of the stolen items ($13,659), the four occasions which the accused had committed the theft offences over a period of less than 12 months, and that there was a certain degree of premeditation where the accused had informed his mother (namely, Yap) that he planned to steal some cameras from the store should the opportunity arise (subject matter of the second charge).

40     However, I am equally mindful of the personal background and circumstances of the accused, which led him to commit the present offences. In particular, the WE CARE report[^13] (which was not challenged by the prosecution), offers a glimpse of the accused’s formative years and how the series of personal setbacks and losses, without any ‘timely psychiatric and therapeutic help in his early years’ , caused him to be become ‘highly emotionally dysregulated’. It is also pertinent to note that ‘his compulsive shoplifting behaviour was a dysfunctional way of coping with stressors and difficult emotions’.

41     Below is an extract from the WE CARE report, which details the accused’s history pertaining to his psychological and medical problems as well as stealing behaviours, which resulted in his attempt to cope with his emotional issues:

> Malvin’s background revealed a history of major psychological and medical challenges from his childhood days. He was diagnosed with severe eczema as a child and had developed compulsive habits regarding cleanliness from young. Being shy and timid, he recalled a lonely adolescent period in which he experienced frequent bullying and scorns from school mates since age 11. He had no friends and feared going to school every day. By the time he entered secondary school, he reported experiencing symptoms indicative of clinical depression and the onset of anxiety disorder. He felt depressed, ostracized and angry most of the time. He had passive suicide ideation but never attempted suicide. He would cut himself in the arms to self-sooth whenever he experienced strong negative emotions. Though he received counselling at secondary school, he did not receive any psychiatric interventions at the time. Despite these difficulties, he completed his GCE “O” levels and enrolled into Nanyang Polytechnic. When he was diagnosed with testicular atrophy in 2009, at the age of 17, the depressive symptoms and anxiety problem escalated to the point where he was unable to complete his polytechnic studies and he dropped out of his diploma course. He was diagnosed with a form of testicular atrophy condition that was deemed irreversible. He perceived this as a form of “abnormality” and became more depressed. Two years later, he experienced another loss – his grandfather died of cancer after a prolonged treatment period. He described his grandfather as the only adult, other than his mother, whom he has a close relationship with.

> These losses, following the unhappy adolescent years of being bullied, further entrenched his sense of isolation and frustration – the self-perception that he is “not normal” and that life has been grossly unfair to him. Though he finally sought psychiatric treatment in 2009 where he was subsequently diagnosed with and treated for Major Depressive Disorder by Dr Robin Goh, he continued to struggle emotionally and psychologically. When he was enlisted into national service, he continued to experience difficulties and felt marginalised and discriminated against. When he met with a car accident in 2014 and suffered from PTSD symptoms, he became more socially avoidant, anxious and depressed.

> He reported starting to experience frequent urge to shoplift around the age of 19 or 20, where he would steal items of little or no value such as mineral water, razor blades, batteries or grocery items. He said he would mostly leave them unused at home or he would give away some items to friends, to earn affection. Over time, he would experience more compulsive and regular urges to shoplift. He had major mood swings and would experience bouts of low mood or anger outburst. In the period prior to the alleged offences, he progressed to stealing more expensive items. His mother reported that he would become highly agitated, even raging if he was prevented from acting out. She reported observing a reduction in his agitation level and restlessness after he acted on his compulsive urges. It would appear that Malvin was having major emotional regulation issues that were unattended to.

42     More crucially is the fact that the accused had begun therapy sessions from April 2018 to ‘address issues related to his perceived sense of unfairness, anger and resentment.’ He has since gained insights that ‘his shoplifting acts, as a way of making life fair again, is both dysfunctional and self-defeating’. It was further recommended by the psychotherapist from WE CARE, Ms Tham Yuen Han (“Ms Tham”), that the accused needs to work on his anger issues and on changing his self-perception of being marginalised and unfairly treated.

43     Further, Ms Tham had also noted that the accused has expressed genuine contrition for his past actions and displayed a willingness to address his emotional issues ‘by committing to regular counselling and psychiatric treatment since the arrest in 2016.’

44     I note that since the arrest in September 2016, which appear to have made a tremendous impact on the accused, he has clearly turned his life round in making concrete changes, by pursuing his education again, where he enrolled in the diploma course (in banking and finance) one month later in October 2016. Since then, he graduated top of his cohort, which also earned him an award. Thereafter, he has commenced his university studies and is currently pursuing a degree in cyber security.

45     I am mindful of the accused’s genuine remorse, his plea of guilt, his readiness to admit to other theft offences (which were not subject of police investigations), albeit the value of such items was small, as well as his ability and motivation to effect concrete changes as seen above. He had also returned items which he had found left in the bus to the police, and which fact, did not go unnoticed. All this taken together strongly indicates his potential for rehabilitation and reintegration into society.

46     The accused is also a first offender and has remained crime free since his arrest. There was nothing in the SOF, which suggest that the accused had stolen the cameras, specifically out of greed. Neither was there any evidence that he had used the cameras after they were stolen in December 2015 till his arrest in September 2016. However, the accused had admitted in the CSO report that ‘he planned to steal the items as he wanted the new model’[^14], which I am prepared to accept that there was some degree of premeditation. However, the items have all since been recovered and the victims suffered no loss.

#### CBS reports

47     Whilst it was undisputed that the accused was suffering from MDD and OCD at the material time, the defence did not submit for a Mandatory Treatment Order suitability report (“MTO report”) to be called, as agreed between parties. That said, the fact remains that the accused will require ‘further psychiatric and therapeutic intervention to build on the change that he has initiated’. It was also recommended by Ms Tham that the accused ‘will benefit from therapy and emotional regulation strategies to learn to better manage his depressive, OCD and anxiety symptoms’.

48     Whilst there may be risk factors highlighted in the DRO report (as noted in \[31\] above), the accused was nonetheless assessed to be at low risk of criminal re-offending. Furthermore, as pointed out and explained by the defence, these risk factors present at the time of the offences (which was some three years ago), may no longer be cause for concern currently, which I was prepared to accept.

49     Whilst the WE CARE report stated that the accused was close to his mother, it was however, undisputed that his father and sister have come forward to show their support by accompanying him to court. His father is also his bailor and it is evident that his father is confident that the accused would not flout his bail conditions even when multiple applications have been made by the accused to leave the jurisdiction. This was also suggestive of the accused’s father keeping in close contact with the accused and kept abreast of his whereabouts.

50     I note that the accused may not have been constructively engaged (either through education or employment) in the preceding years prior to the commission of the offences (from 2010 to 2016), the accused has since been motivated to pursue his studies, which he has done so for the last three years after his arrest.

51     Whilst the accused may have been unable to make friends in the past, this did not seem to be the case during the time when he pursued his diploma studies (which was soon after his arrest). This was evident from his lecturers’ testimonials, stating that he ‘was well-liked by his peers’[^15] and that ‘he works well with his project partners and gets along well with his classmates[^16]’, as well as letters from his two friends (as per \[31(d)\] above), both of whom, appear to be able to provide the emotional support that he needs.

52     I agree with the prosecution that in view of the aggravating factors as stated in \[39\] above, the custodial threshold was clearly crossed. In that regard, rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration, where probation could be considered, would thus not be appropriate.

53     I am thus of the view that the competing sentencing considerations of deterrence and rehabilitation ought to be reflected in the sentence that would be imposed. I found that the accused had nonetheless demonstrated a high potential for rehabilitation in view of the great strides he has made since his arrest, despite the past setbacks and challenges. At the same time, he should be adequately punished and deterred in ensuring that he does not re-offend in future, given the aggravating factors present in the current case. A CBS option, would thus be appropriate given the circumstances. In particular, a SDO in combination with a DRO and CSO, will serve the ends of justice, where reparation to the community can be made in performing community service as well. As stated by See J in _Teo Chang Heng_ at \[17\]:

> In terms of punishment, a SDO will still result in the respondent spending time behind bars for his misdeeds. The SDO in fact signals that what he did _was_ serious and he is not being let off scot-free.

54     A DRO with additional conditions attached, namely, a requirement for the accused to continue with his psychiatric treatment and psychotherapy as well as counselling at WE CARE will ensure that the underlying root causes of his offending behaviour are adequately addressed. The electronic monitoring as an additional condition under the DRO, which would have the effect of restricting the accused’s movements after his release from detention, will serve as a daily reminder to deter the accused from re-offending. As stated by Ms Tham, the accused will ‘benefit from a structured programme to ensure compliance with regular treatment’ with the aim of preventing future re-offending[^17].

55     That said, I did not think that specific or general deterrence in the form of a conviction and an imprisonment term was necessary given the extenuating circumstances as highlighted by the defence. This can be equally achieved through the imposition of a SDO in combination with a DRO and CSO.

56     As for counsel’s contention that a conviction and imprisonment _might_ jeopardise any progress that has been made in the accused’s recovery to date, I agree with the prosecution that there is no evidence suggested by the defence that imprisonment would have a ‘disproportionate impact’ on the accused. Neither is the accused suffering from a terminal illness or that prisons would endanger his life. In any event, the Prisons authorities have stated that they would be able to manage the accused’s condition if he were to be incarcerated.

#### Sentencing precedents

57     Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents where the sentences for offences under section 379 PC for first offenders, range from CBS options to imprisonment terms ranging from 1 week to two months’ imprisonment, depending largely on the value of the stolen items. They are all unreported cases save for _Kwong Siong Choy v PP_ (“_Kwong Siong Choy_”), MA 178/96.

58     Citing the case of _Kwong Siong Choy_, the offender had pleaded guilty to stealing computer accessories from his company worth $9,900. He was working as a salesman for the company and felt that the company owed him commission. All stolen items were recovered. The offender was sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment. The appeal was dismissed by the High Court.

59     Whilst the value of the stolen items in _Kwong Siong Choy_ is less than the total value of the stolen items for the present case, it was noted that the offender had stolen from his employer at the material time, suggesting an abuse of trust by the offender on his employer, the company. In that regard, the prosecution submitted for a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment for the current case, which was lower than the two-month imprisonment term imposed. Even if the sentence was calibrated downwards as suggested by the prosecution, I did not think that an imprisonment term per se should ordinarily be imposed, given the specific circumstances of the present case. For reasons highlighted above, there were extenuating circumstances that suggest a sentencing approach which is more nuanced, to take into account the competing sentencing considerations at play.

## Conclusion

60     All considered, it is clear that the accused is amenable for rehabilitation to address the underlying issues of his offending behaviour. He has indeed demonstrated that he is on the path of reform given the effort and hard work he has put in towards his education as well as undergoing psychiatric treatment and counselling to address the root causes of his offending behaviour. Due credit ought to be given to the accused in this regard that his efforts for the past three years have not been ‘pointless’, which would hopefully encourage him to always strive to better himself. The sentence imposed must also be proportionate to the gravity of the offences. A community sentence comprising of an SDO would thus serve to adequately punish and deter the accused (similar to that in _Teo Chang Heng_ at \[18\]), whilst at the same time, pay heed to the rehabilitative needs of the accused. A10-day SDO coupled with a 200-hour CSO and a 12-month DRO with attached conditions as stated in \[2\] above, would in my view, be appropriate in the circumstances[^18].

_The accused was sentenced to a community sentence comprising of a detention order (“SDO”) of ten days, to undergo a Day Reporting Order (“DRO”) for a period of 12 months (with stipulated conditions) and to perform 200 hours of community service under the Community Service Order (“CSO”)._

[^18]: The co-accused, Yap, who was traced for unrelated antecedents, pleaded guilty to one count of theft committed in furtherance of the common intention with the accused (section 379 read with section 34 PC), namely theft of the cameras valued at $9,298. Two other similar charges (namely, theft of the lenses valued at $4,237 and comic books valued at $104) were TIC for purposes of sentencing. She was found not suitable for MTO. She was sentenced to a five-day SDO, a DRO for a period of 12 months and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. Under the DRO, Yap was further ordered to comply with the following conditions during the said period:a) To remain indoors from 10.00pm till 6.00am;b) To be placed on the Electronic Monitoring Scheme for a period of 6 months;c) To undergo psychiatric treatment; and d) To undergo counselling at WE CARE.On 16 October 2019, the condition for Yap to be on electronic tagging was removed on the request of the Day Reporting Officer as it was causing the pain on her left hip to worsen and she had also developed right ankle and foot swelling as well as back pain. No appeal was lodged by either party for Yap’s case.
