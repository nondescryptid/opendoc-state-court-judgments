\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9251/2021/01.\]

18 November 2021

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused is Ms Nurliana binte Abdul Rahman, a female Singaporean, who was 31 years of age at the time of her arrest on 5 December 2018. She had claimed trial to a charge under s 8_(b)_(ii) and punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”):

> … are charged that you, on or before 9 November 2018, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev. Ed), to wit, Methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev.Ed), which is punishable under Section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185 2008 Rev. Ed).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, as I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, I convicted the accused on the charge in DAC 940130-2018.

3       The matter was adjourned to 14 October 2021 for the Prosecution to prepare the address on sentence and for the accused to prepare her written plea in mitigation. On 14 October 2021, Mr Wee Hong Shern of Ong & Co LLC informed me that he had just been engaged by the accused to prepare her plea in mitigation and requested for time. I note that he would have been the third defence counsel that the accused had engaged for the present charge.

4       On 20 October 2021, I sentenced the accused to 12 months’ imprisonment. I allowed her application to defer the commencement of her sentence to 22 November 2021 to enable her to settle her personal affairs.

5       The accused is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed an appeal against her conviction and sentence on 2 November 2021. She is currently on bail pending the hearing of her appeal. A stay of execution was granted for the sentence of imprisonment.

6       I now set out the grounds of my decision in full.

## Circumstances leading to her arrest and charge

7       On 9 November 2018, the accused had reported to the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) at Bedok Police Divisional HQ for her monthly urine test. This was pursuant to a Supervision Order under Regulations 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations which took effect from 11 November 2016 to 10 November 2018.

8       When an Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) was conducted on the accused’s urine sample, it was positive for amphetamine. The accused then provided two urine samples that were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. It was undisputed that the chain of custody was unbroken from the time she provided both urine samples up to the point where her two urine specimens were analysed by the HSA. The procurement of the accused’s urine samples was in accordance with the procedures as set out in s 31(4) of the MDA.

9       Upon testing, her two urine samples were found by the HSA analysts, Ms Siti Aisyah binte Jamil (PW6) and Mr Ong Han Hui, Jordan (PW7) to contain methamphetamine, a specified drug as evidenced in the HSA certificates issued by both analysts pursuant to s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“MDA”).

10     On 5 December 2018, the accused reported to the investigation officer Mr Tan Wei Soon Joshua (“PW3”) at the Woodlands Division of CNB. The accused was charged for the present offence of drug consumption and a caution statement was recorded from her. She denied having consumed drugs and claimed that she taken medication namely Zyrtec-D. She first attended Court 26 on 10 December 2018 for the present charge of drug consumption.

11     The accused denied knowingly consuming methamphetamine, a specified drug, without authorisation and had relied on what is commonly known as the ‘medication defence’. At trial, she had relied on her use of the NeilMed Sinu Inhaler Nasal Decongestant (the “inhaler”) she had found in her previous rental flat to explain the presence of methamphetamine in her urine.

## Prosecution’s case

12     It is the Prosecution’s position that pursuant to ss 16 and 22 of the MDA, the accused is presumed to have consumed methamphetamine on or before 9 November 2018 in contravention of s 8_(b)_(ii) of the MDA. The burden thus shifts to the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that she did not consume methamphetamine.

## Defence’s case

13     It is the Defence’s case that she has discharged her burden of proof on a balance of probabilities as she had unknowingly or did not have the intention to consume methamphetamine.

## Issues

14     The main issue for my determination was whether the accused had rebutted the presumption of consumption under s 22 of the MDA on balance of probabilities.

15     The trial turned on whether the accused had proven her medication defence on a balance of probabilities and that she had unknowingly consumed it. To rebut the presumption, the accused must prove on balance of probabilities that she did not (a) have the mens rea and/or (b) commit the actus reus of drug consumption (see: _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Ashik bin Aris_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 34</span> at \[234\]).

16     A vague and uncorroborated allegation that the accused consumed medication is insufficient to rebut the presumption (see: _Public Prosecutor v Yusran Bin Yusoff_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 396</span> at \[20\], upheld by the High Court in _Yusran Bin Yusoff v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 74</span> at \[5\]).

### The medication defence

#### The accused’s evidence

17     At trial, the accused testified that when she was pregnant, she had found a bag containing one ‘Vicks’ inhaler and three ‘Sinu Med’ inhalers at her rental flat. She had provided the remaining Sinu Med inhaler to the CNB as she had used the other two inhalers. She further testified her friend ‘Muliana’ saw her take the inhalers and pack them into her medication bag. According to her since her previous admission to DRC, she did not take drugs anymore.

18     She gave evidence that she was unaware that the inhaler contained methamphetamine and had she known she would not have used it. During cross-examination when asked if she had informed PW1 regarding her use of the inhaler, the accused further gave evidence she had not as she was not aware that the inhaler had caused her urine to test positive for methamphetamine. She testified that she had used the inhaler every morning for her sinus. She further testified on 9 November 2018 she was prescribed ten tablets of Zyrtec by her doctor.

19     She gave evidence that on that day before reporting for her urine test, she had sniffed the inhaler and consumed Zyrtec. According to her, she told PW1 that she had consumed Zyrtec and Tramadol but not the inhaler as she had regarding it as something normal and for everyday use. She further gave evidence that on 9 November 2018 when her statement was recorded by PW1, she only stated that she had consumed Zyrtec and Tramadol.

20     She testified that on 5 December 2018 she gave a caution statement to PW3 and had referred to the fact that she had consumed Zyrtec-D. She had looked up on the contents of Zyrtec-D from a website known as _Drugs.com_ and was aware that it contained pseudoephedrine and cetirizine. She agreed with the Prosecution that from the time she discovered that her urine tested positive for methamphetamine, her mind was actively thinking of what could have caused the result.

21     The accused testified that when she picked up the three Sinu Med inhalers she had not seen them before. She had used the inhalers as it was just a normal inhaler to her and because it was a sinus inhaler. She disagreed with the Prosecution when it was put to her that it was not safe for her to use the Sinu Med inhaler as she did not know what it was used for.

#### Documentary evidence

22     It was undisputed that the accused had first raised the medication defence when her first statement was recorded by her Supervision Officer, Staff Sergeant Choo Siew Kee (“PW1”) on 9 November 2018. She had stated that she had consumed Zyrtec and Tramadol.

23     On 23 September 2018, when the accused reported to PW1, she brought along Zyrtec-D tablets which had been prescribed to her by True Medical Clinic Tampines West. PW1 took a photograph of the Zyrtec-D tablets (P2). She did not bring along her ‘Sinu Med’ inhaler because she did not know that it had contained methamphetamine.

24     On 18 July 2019, Mr Nasir Bin Idris Khan Surattee (“PW8”) received one NeilMed Sinu Inhaler nasal decongestant, ten Zyrtec-D tablets and an invoice dated 22 June 2019 from True Medical Clinic issued to the accused (P13). These items had been submitted to CNB by Anthony Law Corporation, the first law firm that had acted for the accused.

25     In the accused’s further statement (P15) recorded on 1 November 2019, she stated that she had handed one inhaler and one slab of Zyrtec-D tablets to her lawyer, Mr William Da Silva from Anthony Law Corporation. She was told that these items would be sent to CNB on her behalf. This was because on 20 June 2019, she had told her Counsel that she recalled sniffing an inhaler in the morning of 9 November 2018 before reporting for her urine test due to her sinus.

26     In P15 the accused stated that in February 2018, she found three unused inhalers that were sealed in the kitchen of the rental flat she had shared with her friend Muliana. She started using the inhaler whenever she had a runny nose. She used two of the inhalers and disposed of them after she had finished using them. She kept one of the inhalers and did not use them. This was the inhaler that she had submitted to the law firm.

### Expert evidence

27     In response to the accused’s defence that her urine had tested positive for methamphetamine due to her use of the NeilMed inhaler, the Prosecution adduced expert evidence through its witnesses from HSA to rebut her defence.

28     Dr Lee Hui Zhi Shirley (“PW5”) from the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of HSA testified methamphetamine has two forms, the _l_\-stereoisomeric form and the _d_\-isomeric form. The full name for the _l_\-form is _levmetamfetamine_ and for the _d_\-form is _dextromethamphetamine_. They are mirror images of each other, have the same molecular formula but are different in three dimensional orientations of their atoms in space.

29     She also testified that a chiral liquid chromatography test conducted on NeilMed Sinu Inhaler show that the methamphetamine is the _l_\-stereoisomeric form and no _d_\-form of methamphetamine was found on the inhaler. She gave evidence that the said inhaler is not a registered pharmaceutical product in Singapore. This means that it cannot be bought over the counters without a prescription. Based on the product label on the inhaler, it contained 50 milligrams of levmetamfetamine.

30     PW6 and PW7, analysts from Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA who had analysed the accused’s urine samples testified that there were only two stereoisomeric forms of methamphetamine and amphetamine, being the _d_\-form and _l_\-form, and each form of methamphetamine can only metabolise into its corresponding amphetamine.

31     They also testified on the sequence of tests conducted on urine samples received from the CNB for HSA’s analysis. From the outset, CNB will inform HSA of the class of drugs which HSA should screen for. They gave evidence that in respect of the accused’s samples, CNB had requested that the samples be screen for amphetamines. The two tests were conducted sequentially, with the first test being the immunoassay screening test and the second test being the mass spectrometry confirmatory test. They also gave evidence that the analytical variation in the results should be no more than 20% and in the present case it was within the acceptable analytical variation of 20%.

32     PW6 testified that the screening test was more favourable to the _d_\-methamphetamine as compared to the _l_\-methamphetamine. There would be a difference in both the initial and confirmatory test if there was only _l_\-methamphetamine present in the urine. The reactivity of _l_\-form is ten times lower than the _d_\-form. The screening test is more likely to show 70 nanograms per millilitre if it is _l_\-methamphetamine and closer to 700 nanograms if it is _d_\-methamphetamine.

33     In the present case, the screening test showed 1466 nanograms per millilitre for the amphetamine class. The confirmatory test indicated 746 nanograms per millilitre of methamphetamine and 720 nanograms per millilitre of amphetamine. Based on the two tests, PW6 gave evidence that it is more like the _d_\-form or a mixture of _d_ and _l f_orm rather than solely _d_ or _l_ form of methamphetamine.

34     PW7 testified that in the present case, the screening test showed 1343 nanograms per millilitre for the amphetamine class. The confirmatory test indicated 643 nanograms per millilitre of methamphetamine and 700 nanograms per millilitre of amphetamine. Based on the two tests, PW7 gave evidence that it was unlikely to be the _l_\-form only but either a _d-_form or a mixture of _d_\-form with a minor amount of _l_ of methamphetamine.

### Analysis of the medication defence

35     I observed that despite raising the Zyrtec-D defence at multiple junctures after investigations commenced, the accused abandoned the Zyrtec-D defence at trial and relied substantially on the inhaler defence. In any event, PW5 gave evidence that one Zyrtec-D tablet was analysed and found to contain pseudoephedrine (P8). According to her, pseudoephedrine is not a controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the MDA. Given that methamphetamine is not an active ingredient in Zyrtec-D, it was clear that the consumption of Zyrtec-D will not give rise to the presence of methamphetamine or amphetamine in the accused’s urine.

36     In respect of the accused’s inhaler defence, I accepted and gave full weight to PW6 and PW7’s evidence as they fell squarely within the scope of their expertise, _ie_ conducting tests on the urine and hair samples sent to the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory and interpreting and explaining the data obtained from such analysis. I found that both PW6 and PW7 had methodically and independently arrived at the same conclusion that the accused’s urine did contain either the _d_\-form of methamphetamine or a mixture of _d_\-form with the _l-_form of methamphetamine.

37     In view of the unchallenged evidence of PW5 that the NeilMed Sinu Inhaler contained the _l_\-form of methamphetamine, I found that the use of the inhaler alone was unlikely to give rise to the concentration results obtained in their analysis of the urine sample. In my view, the only logical conclusion was that the accused had consumed methamphetamine from a source which was not the inhaler, as the inhaler only contained the _l_\-form of methamphetamine. There was also no evidence before me that she was authorised to consume the _d_\-form of methamphetamine.

38     I further agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s inhaler defence was a bare one. The accused was unable to give any reliable evidence pertaining to how she came across the inhaler and she had not called Muliana as a Defence witness. This was despite her claim that Muliana was her “godsis”, and the accused had acknowledged that her testimony could potentially exculpate her.

39     In the present case, I rejected her defence that her urine had tested positive for methamphetamine due to her use of the inhaler. Although she had raised the medication defence on 9 November 2018, this was in respect of Zyrtec-D and Tramadol. It was only after she had engaged her first Counsel in 2019 that she raised the use of the inhaler as part of her defence. In my view, this defence was clearly an afterthought and I did not find her explanations convincing.

40     In the present case, I found that the accused had failed to adduce any evidence to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities.

41     After having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the accused, I was satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution had established its case in respect of the charge in DAC 940130-2018 beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted her on the charge.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

#### s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA

42     The prescribed penalty for an offence of drug consumption prior to the 1 April 2019 amendment to the MDA is a term of imprisonment of up to ten years or $20,000 or to both.

## Antecedents

43     Apart from her antecedents for offences under ss 379 and 420 of the Penal Code and under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, the accused was sent to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre for six months from 12 November 2015 which was further extended for another six months. On 11 November 2016, she was placed on 24 months of drug supervision for consumption of methamphetamine.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

44     The Prosecution had submitted that a sentence of 13 months’ imprisonment was appropriate. In support of its position, the Prosecution had relied on _Public Prosecutor v Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> at \[38\](“Dinesh Singh”), where the sentencing tariff for a first-time drug consumer is 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment for offences committed prior to 1 April 2019.

45     It was the Prosecution’s position that based on _Dinesh Singh_, the relevant factors affecting sentence include:

> (a)     Amount of drugs consumed;

> (b)     The occasion that led to the act of consumption – _ie_ whether it was planned or incidental;

> (c)     Where there others simultaneously consuming drugs;

> (d)     Was there payment involved; and

> (e)     Whether the accused was a first-time consumer or an addict.

#### An uplift from the indicative starting sentence is necessary

46     It was submitted that the framework in _Dinesh Singh_ was contemplated in the context of a guilty plea: In _Dinesh Singh_, the accused person pleaded guilty to a charge of consumption of cocaine and consented to have a second charge of consumption of another Class A drug taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. His appeal was in respect of the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment imposed in the lower court.

47     Conversely, the present accused was only convicted at the end of trial and demonstrated lack of remorse throughout the trial. The accused is not a first-time consumer. Given that the accused had previously been admitted to DRC for a total of 12 months’ and subsequently placed on drug supervision for a period of 24 months, the accused cannot be deemed a “first time consumer”.

#### Consistency with sentencing precedents

48     Based on sentencing precedents, it was submitted a sentence of ten to 13 months’ imprisonment is usually imposed for offenders who claimed trial to a charge under s 8_(b)_(ii) p/u s 33(1) of the MDA:

> (a)      _Public Prosecutor v Surianny Binte Sulaiman_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 182</span>: The accused who was untraced, claimed trial to one charge of consuming methamphetamine. The accused was convicted at the end of trial and sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment;

> (b)      _Public Prosecutor v Syed Muhammad Hamzah Aljunied_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 235</span>: The accused claimed trial to one charge of consuming methamphetamine. The accused, who was previously admitted to DRC for 13 months for consumption of a specified drug and placed under drug supervision for 24 months, was convicted at the end of trial and sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment.

## Mitigation

49     In his written plea in mitigation, Mr Wee Hong Shern had set out her personal and family background. He submitted that the accused was remorseful for her mistake and hoped to turn over a new leaf. She was contrite especially towards her son. She implored for compassion and leniency as a long period of incarceration would be detrimental to the growth and development of her son who is still in his formative years.

50     It was highlighted that she would incur ongoing expenses as the tenancy period for the rental HDB unit is for two years and she has lived there for only seven months.

51     It was submitted that although she was not a first-time transgressor, it was submitted that her stint in DRC was only for six months and this was more than five years ago. It was further submitted that a sentence of ten to 11 months’ imprisonment should be imposed.

## Decision on Sentence

52     In my determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed I was guided by the High Court decision in _Dinesh Singh_. In the present case, the accused was convicted at the end of trial and had demonstrated a lack of remorse throughout the trial. The accused was not a first offender. She had also previously been admitted to DRC for a total of 12 months and subsequently placed on drug supervision for a period of 24 months. All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in the circumstances.
