### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

The accused, a 19-year old male, pleaded guilty to three charges, namely, one count for cutting the RFID[^1] electronic monitoring tag (“RFID tag”), causing damage to the said tag valued at $321, belonging to the Singapore Prisons, which offence is punishable under section 426 of the Penal Code Cap 224 (PC) (“mischief charge”) and two counts of abetting his co-accused, one Brendon Siak Kai Jun (“Brendon”), by intentionally aiding him to cheat the victims, which offences are punishable under section 420 read with section 109 PC (“cheating charges”).

2       Seven charges were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing which included one count of cutting his RFID tag, an offence of mischief under section 426 PC, one count of receiving stolen property under section 411(1) PC (“receiving stolen cash charge”) and five counts of abetting Brendon by intentionally aiding him to cheat the respective victims, which offences are punishable under section 420 read with section 109 PC.

3       The accused had committed the above offences, while he was serving a sentence of reformative training (“first RT order”) which was imposed on 18 October 2016. Under the first RTC order, the accused was placed on the “Release-On-Supervision Scheme” (“ROS scheme”) on 5 September 2018, where he was required to be placed on electronic monitoring as well as to reside with his mother. The accused had committed the present offences while he was on the ROS scheme. At the time the accused was sentenced for the current offences, he was re-called back and serving his sentence for the first RTC order in the reformative training centre (“RTC”).

4       The prosecution initially submitted for a global sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment. The accused had instead sought for reformative training to be imposed so that he could continue his education in RTC. I exercised my discretion to call for a reformative training suitability report (“RTC report”) to consider if the accused should be sentenced to a second RT order. The accused was found suitable for reformative training at level 2 intensity of rehabilitation.

5       On 8 August 2019, the prosecution agreed and submitted for a sentence of reformative training as recommended in the RTC report. The accused did not object to the same. Accordingly, he was sentenced to undergo reformative training for a minimum period of 12 months’ detention in RTC. However, on 16 August 2019, the accused filed a notice of appeal against sentence. He is currently serving his sentence.

## Summary of Facts

6       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts pertaining to the above charges, without qualification. The salient points are as follows:

> DAC 913424/2019 (Mischief)

> (a)     On 5 September 2018, the accused, while serving the first RT order, was released on the ROS scheme where he was made to wear a RFID tag and reside with his mother.

> (b)     Thereafter, the accused was detected to have violated his time curfew restrictions on several occasions. On 1 December 2018, the accused was thus issued a Notice to Report where he was to report to his senior re-integration officer on 3 December 2018. However, the accused failed to do so as required and remained uncontactable. A Police Gazette for his arrest, was thus issued against the accused.

> (c)     On 18 December 2018, the accused was arrested by officers from the Commercial Affairs Department for the offence of receiving stolen property. At that time, the accused had already removed his RFID tag, belonging to the Singapore Prisons, valued at $321.

> DAC 918280/2019 and DAC 918283/2019 (Abetment to cheat)

> (d)     The co-accused is Brendon Siak Kai Jun (“Brendon”), whom the accused got to know through a mutual friend sometime in 2015.

> (e)     Sometime in November 2018, Brendon visited the accused at his house where he obtained several pre-registered mobile phone SIM cards belonging to the accused. Brendon would subsequently post fictitious advertisements offering to sell various concert tickets on the online e-commerce platform “Carousell”. When the potential buyers contacted Brendon, he would provide them with a mobile number from one of the pre-registered mobile phone SIM cards he obtained from the accused. Once an agreement was made between Brendon and the buyer, the former would then direct the buyer to make payment into the accused’s bank account.

> (f)     When the mobile number from the pre-registered mobile phone SIM cards were deactivated, Brendon would obtain additional pre-registered SIM cards from the accused, so as to continue with his scam. The accused was aware of Brendon’s scam but nonetheless permitted Brendon to obtain the pre-registered mobile phone SIM cards from him for this purpose.

> (g)     After Brendon obtained these SIM cards, he would list new fictitious advertisements on “Carousell”, inviting potential buyers to contact him at the new mobile phone numbers he obtained from the accused.

> (h)     On 1 December 2018, the first victim contacted Brendon seeking to purchase “Zoukout” tickets which Brendon had advertised for sale on “Carousell”. The parties negotiated and eventually agreed on the price of $318 in exchange for three such tickets. Brendon, agreed to sell the same to the first victim, despite knowing that he did not have the said tickets to deliver to the first victim.

> (i)     The first victim then transferred the agreed payment of $318 to a “Paylah” account bearing mobile number XXX, which mobile phone SIM card was provided for by the accused. Once payment was received, Brendon ceased communicating with the first victim and never delivered the tickets.

> (j)     Similarly, the second victim agreed to purchase “Zoukout” tickets from Brendon, who had advertised that he had such tickets for sale on “Carousell”. The parties agreed on the price of $300 in exchange for three such tickets. Once payment was made by the second victim, Brendon ceased communications with the said victim and never delivered the tickets.

> (k)     Brendon would not have been able to carry out the scam had the accused not provided him with the pre-registered mobile phone SIM cards to do the same.

## Prosecution’s Submissions

8       The prosecution had initially submitted for two weeks’ imprisonment for the offence of mischief and at least six weeks’ imprisonment for each of the cheating offences, with two of the sentences running consecutively, giving a global sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment. The total value of the amounts involved for the cheating offences is $1,273. A table of sentencing precedents was tendered to support such a submission (“Exhibit P3”).

9       However, after having perused the RTC report, the prosecution did not object to the sentence of reformative training to be imposed at level 2 intensity of rehabilitation as recommended.

## Mitigation

10     The accused had sought for a sentence of reformative training to be imposed so that he could continue his education in the RTC. He had indicated that he was unable to continue his studies due to a ‘discipline issue’ during the first RT order. He did not elaborate further on the details of the ‘discipline issue’. The accused was minded to apply to sit for the “Normal (Academic)” level exams as the next step in his academic career, as his highest educational qualifications was at the Normal (Technical) level. In that regard, he had hoped that with a second RT order, it would afford him the opportunity to continue his studies and prepare for his future. Even after the RTC report was read to the accused, he did not object to the imposition of the same.

## Decision of the court

### Sentencing considerations in relation to a young offender

11     It is undeniable that the cheating charges are serious as evident in the punishment prescribed, which carries a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 10 years and a discretionary fine of up to $30,000.

12     As for the mischief charge, the punishment prescribed is imprisonment of up to one year or a discretionary fine of up to $30,000 or both.

13     I am mindful of the competing sentencing considerations of deterrence and rehabilitation when deciding on the appropriate sentence for the accused, a young offender, who has committed serious offences as stated above, in particular, the cheating charge, which carries a mandatory imprisonment term. That said, as a starting point, rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration when deciding on an appropriate sentence for a young offender aged 21 years and below (see _PP v Mok Ping Wuen_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 439</span> (“_Maurice Mok”_) at \[21\] and followed in _PP_ v _Leon Russel Francis_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 167</span> (“_Leon Russel Francis_”) at \[13\]).

14     As observed by the learned Justice of Appeal, Justice VK Rajah in the case of _PP v Mohamed Al Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR 449</span> (“_Al Ansari_”) at \[58\]:

> .. it is clear that reformative training by itself, with the attendant element of incarceration, implicitly carries with it a significant deterrent effect, both on a specific and general level. As such, it is my view that the sentencing option of reformative training provides the courts with a middle ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence in relation to young offenders..

15     In determining the balance to be struck between the dominant consideration for rehabilitation and the need for deterrence, some relevant factors to be considered as stated in _Al Ansari_ at \[67\] included:

> (a)     the seriousness of the offence;

> (b)     the culpability of the offender;

> (c)     the existence of antecedents;

> (d)     the nature of the rehabilitation best suited for the offender;

> (e)     the availability of familial support in the rehabilitative efforts; and

> (f)     any other special reasons or need for rehabilitation.

16     Further, as noted by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the case of _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“_Boaz Koh_”) at \[30\], rehabilitation can be diminished or eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution in appropriate situations, where (the “_Boaz_ factors” as termed by Chan Seng Onn J in the case of _Muhammad Zuhairie Adely Bin Zulkifli v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 134</span> (“_Muhammad Zuhairie_”) at \[23\]) :

> (a)     the offence is serious;

> (b)     the harm caused is severe;

> (c)     the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; or

> (d)     the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable.

17     As observed by Chan J in _Muhammad Zuhairie_ at \[30\], that in light of the relevant factors as stated in _Al Ansari_ (as above), as well as consideration of the _Boaz_ factors:

> ..it would still be necessary for the court to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances which ultimately aid the court in achieving the right balance between deterrence and rehabilitation when sentencing a young offender. In the delicate balancing exercise, one of the key considerations would in my view be the _rehabilitative potential of the young offender._

18     With the above sentencing considerations in mind, I now turn to the factual matrix of the present case.

## Evaluation and reasons for decision

#### Seriousness of the offences

19     As stated above, the cheating charges are serious in view of the punishment prescribed, which attracts mandatory imprisonment terms.

20     The mischief charges (including one TIC charge) are in relation to the accused cutting the RFID tag to avoid detection when he had breached the time restrictions[^3] and stayed away from his mother’s place of residence when he was released on the ROS scheme. Such offences would usually be visited with imprisonment terms (see “Exhibit P3”).

#### Culpability of the accused

21     The accused had committed the current offences while he was on the ROS scheme. It was clear that once he was released back to the community (the purpose of which was to re-integrate him back into the community for his rehabilitation), he had scant regard for authority or rules as evident in not only in his re-offending, but also by his deliberate removal of his RFID tag and staying away from home. He had not only breached the requirements of the ROS scheme, which would necessitate the accused being re-called back to serve his sentence of reformative training in RTC, his behaviour escalated in severity when he committed the cheating charges as well as the offence of receiving stolen property (TIC charge).

22     I am also mindful of the accused’s role in the cheating offences where he had provided the pre-registered mobile phone SIM card to the co-accused which facilitated the commission of the offences, where such offences committed on the online marketplace platform, “Carousell”, are easy to commit but difficult to detect. Such e-commerce transactions are meant to be convenient for users in genuine transactions. However, for such offenders like the accused and the co-accused person, they prey on the unsuspecting victims, to clearly benefit themselves financially.

23     The total loss suffered by the victims involved in the cheating charges (i.e. $1,273) as well as the receiving stolen cash charge (i.e. $324), amounting to $1,597, is not insubstantial. There was also no evidence of restitution made either.

#### Existence of antecedents

24     The accused was clearly not a first offender. He had either breached the requirements under the probation order or committed offences while he was in the SBH. As stated above, he was previously sentenced to probation by the YC in 2015 for an offence of housebreaking by night (where TIC charges included property related offences and the offence of rash act), following which the probation order was revoked after he had undergone probation for about one year, where he was subsequently sentenced to reside in the SBH for 21 months in March 2016. About six months’ later, he had breached the JRC order when he had committed offences which included vandalism and conspiring with others to escape from lawful custody, namely, from the SBH. For this, he was sentenced to RTC in October 2016.

#### Conduct during release on ROS scheme during first RT order

25     Not content to abide by rules or change his attitude to re-integrate into the community, the accused re-offended within two months after his release on the ROS scheme. He had breached the time restrictions imposed as he reported drinking alcohol thrice a week with his anti-social peers, as he ‘wanted to have fun with them’, following which he had cut his RFID tag and stayed with one of his friends instead of remaining at home.

26     During the period of abscondance from supervision, the accused was not constructively engaged either as he was unable to sustain employment given his regular alcohol consumption, which resulted in difficulties in waking up on time to report for work the next day. Furthermore, given his lack of interest in work, as well as his poor working attitude (by failing to wake up on time), he was consequently, unable to maintain stable employment. He would thus spend most of his time ‘idling’ with his negative peers and in the current instance, resort to committing the current offences (namely, the cheating charges and receiving stolen cash charge), out of peer loyalty as well as for financial gain[^4].

#### Poor familial support

27     A single parent, whose husband was deceased, the accused’s mother shared a distant relationship with him[^5]. The accused did not confide in her when he faced problems except when he needed money from her. He was clearly not receptive to his mother’s advice at all as he perceived her advice to not re-offend as ‘nagging’, which did not help in curbing his repeated offending behaviour. It was evident that the accused’s mother was unable to exert any positive influence over his lifestyle choices, peers or activities. In fact, he had minimal contact with his mother during the period of abscondance from supervision[^6].

#### Selection of the appropriate sentence

28     Given the seriousness of the current offences committed coupled with the accused’s re-offending in November 2018, merely two months after he was placed on the ROS scheme in September 2018, there is thus evidently a need for deterrence – both general and specific --- which must be reflected in the sentence to be imposed, to deter the accused from his criminal offending ways.

29     The accused’s past history of repeated breaches of the requirements under the probation order, his breaching of rules in institutions like the SBH and RTC (where he was even expelled from the Tanah Merah Prison School in 2017 due to his involvement in a fight) and even as recent in June 2019, where he was involved in a fight during remand, shows a propensity towards ‘antisocial’ behaviour[^7].

30     There was also an overall genuine lack of remorse where it was stated in the RTC report that the accused had ‘minimised the severity of his crimes, institutional offences and his breach of his supervision conditions’. He continued to maintain that he perceived the ‘consequences would not be severe or he would not be punished despite previous arrests for his offending behaviours’[^8].

31     From the above, a deterrent sentence would thus appear to be an option for the court to seriously consider. However, as the accused is a young offender at the material time, namely, below 21 years old, I am of the view that rehabilitation still retained its primacy in the sentencing matrix. Given the accused’s previous antecedents and his personal circumstances, the issue then is what would be the most appropriate sentence to be imposed.

32     Notwithstanding the fact that the accused had requested for reformative training and had not objected to the same being imposed, he has nonetheless, lodged an appeal against sentence.

33     Be that as it may, given the accused’s young age, there are thus three sentencing options available to this court, namely, probation, reformative training or imprisonment.

34     I did not think that probation would be suitable given his poor familial support and the risk factors that were presumably present during the first probation order, do not seem to have been addressed, which would point to any cause for optimism as to the accused’s prospects for rehabilitation (see _Boaz Koh_ at \[58\]). After the accused was released on the ROS scheme, he remained unengaged in that he was neither in school or in gainful employment. He was still mixing around with his negative peers and had even re-offended by committing offences together with them.

35     Notwithstanding the need for specific deterrence as highlighted above, I did not think that the accused was such a hardened offender or that the offences were so heinous that the accused was devoid of any realistic prospect of being reformed which necessitated a custodial sentence to be imposed, similar to the case of _PP v Mohamed Noh Hafiz bin Osman_ \[2003\] 4 SLR (R) 281 (“_Mohamed Noh_”)[^9]. Whilst _Mohamed Noh’s_ case can be distinguished from the present case in that the offences committed in _Mohamed Noh_ are far more serious and heinous than the present charges, nonetheless, an imprisonment term, which is deterrent in nature and for which rehabilitation would have lesser dominance, would to my mind, not be the preferred sentencing option given the circumstances of the present case.

36     All considered, a sentence of reformative training would therefore be the most appropriate sentence in the circumstances as it would represent a right balance between the twin goals of rehabilitation and deterrence (see _Al Ansari_ as above).

37     Whilst I am mindful that this is the accused’s second reformative training order, I am of the view that given the accused’s multiple needs which require intervention, another stint in RTC would afford him the opportunity to address his areas of need which include ‘his attitudes supportive of crime, association with anti-social peers, lack of engagement in employment and pro-social activities as well as poor familial relationships[^10]’. In his mitigation plea, the accused had requested to be sentenced to reformative training as he wanted to go back to school. It is hoped that with a firm guiding hand offered by the counsellors in RTC, he will also be able to benefit from the education programmes offered and be motivated to stay on the right track.

38     Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to undergo reformative training for a minimum of 12 months’ detention in the RTC.

_The accused was sentenced to undergo reformative training for a minimum of 12 months’ detention in a reformative training centre._

The victims were pre-pubescent girls where he followed them into lifts when they were returning home alone. He would follow them into the lifts and approach them from behind after they emerged from the lifts, covered their mouths and dragged them to a staircase landing where the offences were committed. The accused was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.
