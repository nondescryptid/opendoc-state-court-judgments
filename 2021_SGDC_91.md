Civil Procedure – Limitation

3 June 2021

### District Judge Lynette Yap:

## Background

1       The plaintiff, a pedestrian, was collided into by a SMRT bus driven by the defendant on 14 May 2016 at about 12.35am when she was crossing a signalised traffic junction at Yishun Avenue 1 leading into Yishun Bus Interchange. The plaintiff was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital by ambulance and found to have severe injuries including head and brain injuries, a closed fracture of the distal end of the radius, comminuted ulnar styloid process fracture, elbow laceration, liver contusion and menorrhagia.

2       The plaintiff filed the writ of summons on 18 June 2019, three years one month and four days after the accident. The defendant did not dispute that he was negligent and at the commencement of the trial, parties informed the court that they had reached an agreement as to the liability of the defendant at 85% in the plaintiff’s favour, provided that the plaintiff’s action was not time-barred by section 24A(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) (“the Act”).

3       The sole issue before the court was therefore whether the plaintiff had the requisite knowledge to bring an action for damages in respect of her injury as set out in section 24A(4)(b) of the Act, prior to 18 June 2016. If the plaintiff had the requisite knowledge before 18 June 2016, the action would be time-barred. Conversely, if the plaintiff had the requisite knowledge on or after 18 June 2016, the action would have been commenced within the limitation period.

## The relevant provisions

4       The relevant provisions of the Act are as follows:

> 24A(2)    An action to which this section applies, where the damages claimed consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other person, shall not be brought after the expiration of –

>> (a)    3 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or

>> (b)    3 years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff has the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury, if that period expires later than the period mentioned in paragraph (a).

5       The definition of “knowledge” in section 24A(4) of the Act, is as follows:

> 24A(4)    In subsections (2) and (3), the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury or damage (as the case may be) means knowledge-

>> (a)    that the injury or damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of duty;

>> (b)    of the identity of the defendant;

>> (c)    if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other than the defendant, of the identity of that person and the additional facts supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant; and

>> (d)    of material facts about the injury or damage which would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such injury or damage to consider it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment.

6       The knowledge imputed to the plaintiff in the context of the Act refers not only to actual knowledge but knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire. For the sake of brevity, I will refer to this as “constructive knowledge”. Section 24A(6) states as follows:

> 24A(6)    For the purposes of this section, _a person’s knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire-_

>> (a)    from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or

>> (b)    from facts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek.

> _(emphasis added)_

## The plaintiff’s case

7       The plaintiff, her father, and Dr Eugene Yang, Senior Consultant, Head Division of Neurosurgery Department of Surgery Khoo Teck Puat Hospital testified on the plaintiff’s behalf.

8       In the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim, she averred in paragraph 7 that:

> The plaintiff had no knowledge of the identity of the defendant at the time of the accident and was immediately hospitalised on that date. She would not have been able to ascertain this information until she had reasonable opportunity to source for and appoint solicitors/experts to conduct the relevant searches in order to procure the accident reports containing this information. Due to her severe injuries which included amnesia, she was hospitalised until 23 May 2016 and placed on hospitalisation leave by Khoo Teck Puat Hospital until 23 August 2016 (excluding subsequent outpatient sick leave). In the premises the Limitation Period of 3 years would not run until the plaintiff had recovered sufficiently to the extent that she could reasonably be expected to take steps to ascertain the identity of the defendant…

9       In paragraph 7 of the plaintiff’s AEIC, she referred to various medical reports and stated that she had suffered serious head injuries, psychological conditions and symptoms as follows:

> (a)     “Fracture of the left parietal bone, acute subdural haematoma along right frontal, temporal and parietal lobes with traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure and haemorrhagic contusion of the left occipital lobe. Continuing disabilities including anosmia/hyposmia, poor memory, inability to concentrate and anxiety, MRI brain in 2017 showed siderosis in the bilateral temporal lobes”;

> (b)     “Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood”;

> (c)     “Benign positional paroxysmal vertigo’; and

> (d)     “Cognitive disabilities in terms of immediate and delayed memory and attention span”.

10     The plaintiff also stated in paragraph 9 of her AEIC that she was in considerable pain, dazed, disoriented and in a state of amnesia which affected her memory of the accident and her short-term memory. Shewas discharged on 23 May 2016 and given “hospitalisation leave” until 23 August 2016.

11     The plaintiff’s evidence was that a police officer had called her during her hospitalisation sometime between her admission to the hospital on 14 May 2016 and her discharge on 23 May 2016, to tell her that he could only start investigations after she had made an accident report[^1].

12     Upon the plaintiff’s discharge from hospital on 23 May 2016, she went to Yishun North Neighbourhood Police Centre (“NPC”) with her father to report the accident. Her evidence was that at that point of time, she had no recollection of the accident and was not able to discuss it. Given her state of mind, her father had handled the reporting of the accident and she had simply signed the report[^2]. She also stated that she was not able to provide a sketch map and the accident report wrongly stated the direction that the bus had come from. During cross-examination, she stated that she had been given a “green card” by the traffic police or nurse during her hospitalisation which provided details of the accident’s location, time and date and she had given that information to the police officer at Yishun North NPC[^3]. She had asked the police officer for the name of the bus driver, but the police officer had stated that this was confidential[^4].

13     The plaintiff stated that after she was discharged from hospital, the days that followed continued to be a blur as she was on relatively strong pain medication, in intense pain, dazed, disoriented and could not remember much. She cried a lot and was very depressed, anxious and confused about what had occurred[^5]. She further stated that this state of affairs continued in the weeks and months following the accident and she was not in a position physically or mentally to apply her mind to the matter let alone search for suitable lawyers and attend at their office, discuss the matter and enter into a retainer by signing a warrant to act for the lawyers to conduct the relevant searches[^6].

14     Dr Eugene Yang, Senior Consultant, Head Division of Neurosurgery Department of Surgery Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“Dr Yang”), stated in his medical report dated 10 October 2019 that the plaintiff suffered head injuries that resulted in post-traumatic amnesia and would require at least eight weeks or more to recover from her head injuries[^7]. He further stated in his medical report dated 5 December 2019 that he understood that in order to discover the identity of the defendant, the plaintiff would have to apply her mind to the matter, search for suitable lawyers to attend at their office, discuss the matter and enter into a retainer by signing the warrant to act. He confirmed that in view of the plaintiff’s condition, a reasonable period for her to recover sufficiently to apply her mind and take such steps to address the matter, would be at least eight weeks[^8]. During cross-examination, he confirmed that the need to engage solicitors, source for a law firm and identify the defendant required higher cognitive functions and the plaintiff would require about eight weeks to do so[^9].

15     The plaintiff contended that due to her severe injuries, the earliest she could have been in a position to ascertain the defendant’s identity would be at least eight weeks from the date of accident on 14 May 2016, i.e. around mid-July 2016. On this basis, she contended that she was within the limitation period when she filed the writ of summons on 18 June 2019.

## The defendant’s case

16     The defendant did not testify at the trial and did not call any witnesses to testify.

17     The defendant submitted that the SCDF report had recorded the observation that on arrival at the scene of the accident, the patient was “found conscious and alert”[^10]. The plaintiff’s medical report dated 23 February 2017 also stated that “on examination at (the) emergency department, she was alert and fully conscious”, “her conscious level was full through inpatient stay” and she was “discharged stable and afebrile on 23/5/2016 with outpatient appointments…”[^11].

18     The defendant relied on the plaintiff’s evidence during cross-examination that personnel from the defendant’s taxi company SMRT visited her sometime while she was hospitalised from 14 May 2016 to 23 May 2016 and asked for the amount of compensation she was seeking for the accident[^12].

19     In addition, the defendant referred to the traffic police report made by the plaintiff on 23 May 2016 at Yishun North NPC to contend that the plaintiff had actual or at least constructive knowledge of the defendant’s identity by this date at the latest[^13].

20     The defendant submitted that it was clear that the plaintiff knew the following prior to or at least by the time she made the accident report on 23 May 2016 at Yishun North NPC:

> (a)     The date of the accident;

> (b)     The time of the accident;

> (c)     The location of the accident;

> (d)     She had been hit by a SMRT bus;

> (e)     SMRT personnel had asked her how much in compensation she wanted;

> (f)     A police officer had called her to say he could only start investigations upon her making an accident report and she knew that was what she had to do;

> (g)     She asked the police officer at Yishun North NPC the name of the bus driver but was told that it was confidential; and

> (h)     The plaintiff’s father who was a taxi driver for over twenty years, knew of the obligation to make an accident report if a claim for damage, loss or injury was pursued[^14].

## My decision

21     Insofar as this case is concerned, the plaintiff’s pleadings in respect of the “knowledge required for bringing an action for damages” as defined in section 24A(2) of the Act, were confined to the plaintiff’s absence of knowledge of the identity of the defendant under section 24A(4)(b)[^15].

22     If the plaintiff had the requisite knowledge of the identity of the defendant (including knowledge which she might reasonably have been expected to acquire) by 23 May 2016 as contended by the defendant, the matter would be time-barred. Conversely, if the plaintiff only had the requisite knowledge of the identity of the defendant at least eight weeks after 14 May 2016 i.e. mid-July 2016 as contended by the plaintiff, the matter would not be time-barred.

23     Section 24A(6) further explains that knowledge includes constructive knowledge in relation to “knowledge which a person might reasonably have been expected to acquire” from facts observable or ascertainable by him or facts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice.

24     The crux of the issue in this case is whether the plaintiff’s medical condition was a relevant factor in assessing the point in time from which she would have been reasonably expected to acquire knowledge of the defendant’s identify, from the various facts observable or ascertainable to her.

25     The plaintiff submitted that the present case was similar to _Yen Kean Seng v Lim Hoo Hua and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 72</span> (“_Yen Kean Seng_”), which involved a plaintiff who was a Malaysian who worked in Singapore as a work-permit holder. His employers did not visit him or provide any form of support after he met with the accident and was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. He was advised by the hospital to leave and return to Malaysia for treatment because he could not afford to pay for the hospital expenses. He was discharged from hospital in a wheelchair and, assisted by his brother and wife, he lodged a police report of the accident before returning to Malaysia. It was argued by the defendant in that case that the latest point at which the plaintiff would have acquired constructive knowledge of the driver’s particulars was the date the plaintiff had lodged the police report before returning to Malaysia, since he could have made the necessary enquiries when he made his police report that day.

26     The District Judge specifically took into account the plaintiff’s particular circumstances in analysing the point in time from which the plaintiff would reasonably have been in a position to ascertain the defendant’s identity. The District Judge noted that the plaintiff was in Malaysia for medical care that was affordable to him, and it was reasonable that he only returned to Singapore after a period of recuperation. He also observed that the plaintiff had no one in Singapore to assist him to make the relevant enquiries and that the employer had not provided any support. Accordingly, he rejected the defendant’s submissions and found on the facts that the earliest point in time when the plaintiff could reasonably have started to make enquiries of the driver’s particulars was when the plaintiff returned to Singapore two months later to engage solicitors.

27     The defendant relied on the two cases of _Wee Thiam Chai Benjamin v Ramesh Kumar s/o Perumal_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 238</span> (“_Wee Thiam Chai Benjamin_”) and _Chang Tong Seng v Lim Tai Kwong_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGDC 74</span> (“_Chang Tong Seng_”), where the District Court had in both cases dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim.

28     In _Wee Thiam Chai Benjamin_, which involved a hit and run accident, the District Court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim and held at \[16\] and \[19\] that in respect of the defendant’s identity, and the attributability of his injuries to the defendant’s conduct, a “reasonable belief” on the plaintiff’s part was enough to start time running. In that case, the plaintiff had received a letter from the Traffic Police stating the registration number of the vehicle involved in the accident with the plaintiff. The court found that this letter indicated that the police had discovered the identity of the person to whom the plaintiff’s consequent injuries were attributable. Accordingly, the plaintiff might reasonably have been expected to acquire knowledge of these matters upon receiving the letter and time should have started running from that date, or “if one were to allow time for the plaintiff to consider his options and to launch his enquiries – 1 to 2 months after…”.

29     In _Chang Tong Seng_, the plaintiff’s claim was also dismissed by the District Court, which held that since the plaintiff’s employers had actual knowledge of the registration number of the defendant’s vehicle, constructive knowledge could be imputed to the plaintiff based on this source of information since the plaintiff had ample opportunity to approach his superiors and colleagues to enquire about the circumstances of the accident and could easily have called any of them.

30     Section 24A(6) expressly states that a person’s knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire. An analysis of all three District Court cases cited above show that in determining if the plaintiff had the requisite knowledge (particularly constructive knowledge), the standard is one of reasonableness on the specific facts of the case, including the particular circumstances the plaintiff found himself in.

31     In _Yen Kean Seng_, the District Judge appears to have applied this principle in considering the personal situation and circumstances of the plaintiff, who had been seriously injured and was recuperating in Malaysia, and in concluding that the plaintiff’s return to Singapore to engage solicitors two months after his accident was reasonable within the meaning of Section 24A(6). The District Judge further observed at \[27\] that in a given factual scenario, the services of a solicitor could be the most expedient way for a plaintiff to ascertain the requisite knowledge. The court concluded that the appointment of solicitors is one of the factors to be considered in answering the question as to when the plaintiff acquired the requisite knowledge.

32     In _Wee Thiam Chai Benjamin_, the District Court found that the plaintiff might reasonably have been expected to acquire knowledge of the defendant’s identity by the date the plaintiff received a letter from the Traffic Police stating that the identity of the potential defendant had been established. However, the District Judge also specifically noted that the plaintiff could be afforded a reasonable time of one to two months after the receipt of the Traffic Police’s letter to consider his options and launch enquiries. These observations were made even in the absence of any apparent incapacity of the plaintiff at the time he received the Traffic Police’s letter, suggesting that even in non-exceptional cases, some reasonable time was implied within the meaning of section 24A(6) when considering the requisite knowledge which a person might reasonably have been expected to acquire.

33     In _Chang Tong Seng_, the plaintiff had conceded that nobody had prevented him from obtaining the material details of the accident. In that case (and unlike the present case), the fact that the plaintiff was on medical leave at home did not prevent or impede him from ascertaining the relevant facts after he was discharged from hospital. The District Court held that it was asking no more of him than was reasonable, in expecting him to make enquiries with his superiors or colleagues shortly after his discharge from hospital. The District Judge specifically explored the test of “reasonableness” at \[18\] to \[20\] and observed that, although the issue has not been fully argued in Singapore, two positions were available: that only the situation of the plaintiff is relevant, or that the plaintiff’s personal characteristics such as character or intelligence should additionally be taken into account in determining reasonableness. In either case, at the minimum, the circumstances of the plaintiff, outside of his personal subjective characteristics, must be considered.

34     In my view, on the evidence before the court, it could not be said that the plaintiff might reasonably have been expected to acquire knowledge of the defendant’s identity by 18 June 2016. As set out earlier, Dr Yang’s evidence was that the plaintiff had suffered head injuries that resulted in post-traumatic amnesia and would require at least eight weeks or more to recover from her head injuries[^16]. He also confirmed that in view of the plaintiff’s condition, a reasonable period of time for her to recover sufficiently to apply her mind to discover the identity of the defendant, and take the relevant steps to address the matter, including sourcing for a law firm and engaging solicitors, would be at least eight weeks[^17]. This evidence was not undermined in the course of cross-examination and the defendant also did not adduce any evidence to contradict Dr Yang’s testimony.

35     The case of _Wee Thiam Chai Benjamin_ did not assist the defendant. As I have explained, the District Court in that case observed that even in the absence of any apparent incapacity on the plaintiff’s part, that it might have been reasonable to allow a plaintiff one to two months to consider his options and take action. In any event, in the present case, Dr Yang has provided clear evidence that the plaintiff’s medical state was such that she would have needed at least eight weeks from the date of the accident on 14 May 2016 to have recovered the relevant cognitive functions to take the necessary actions.

36     For completeness, I will address the defendant’s arguments that the plaintiff was “found conscious and alert”[^18] at the scene of the accident, “alert and fully conscious” when examined in the emergency department, that “her conscious level was full through inpatient stay” and that she was “discharged stable and afebrile on 23/5/2016 with outpatient appointments…”[^19]. The mere fact that the plaintiff was conscious did not contradict Dr Yang’s evidence. Dr Yang obviously examined the plaintiff while she was conscious, and concluded that notwithstanding her consciousness, her cognitive abilities had been impaired to the extent that she would have needed at least eight weeks to reasonably contemplate taking the necessary actions to identify the defendant.

37     For similar reasons, I rejected the defendant’s arguments regarding the plaintiff having had information about certain details of the accident, including the date, time and location of the accident, that it was a SMRT bus that hit her; and that representatives from SMRT and the police had spoken to her about the accident. The mere fact that the plaintiff was in possession of this information did not undermine Dr Yang’s assessment that she did not have the higher cognitive functions necessary to act upon that information to acquire the identity of the defendant.

38     In view of the personal situation and circumstances of the plaintiff, I accept the plaintiff’s case that the earliest point in time when she could reasonably have started to have the requisite knowledge to bring an action against the defendant would be at least eight weeks from the date of the accident on 14 May 2016, i.e. around mid-July 2016. I find that she did not act in a dilatory manner and was therefore within the limitation period when she filed the writ of summons on 18 June 2019.

## Conclusion

39     As an agreement in respect of the proportion of liability had been reached by the parties, there will be interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant at 85% in the plaintiff’s favour, with damages to be assessed and costs, interest and disbursements reserved.
