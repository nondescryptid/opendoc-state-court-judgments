Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Penal Code

Aggravated Outrage of Modesty – Section 354A(1)

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9219/2022/01.\]

16 November 2022

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Lim Kwok Peng, aged 50, pleaded guilty to one charge for committing an offence of aggravated outrage of modesty (“aggravated OM”) under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). He had grabbed the Victim’s right breast (over clothes) with his right hand and in order to commit the offence, he wrongfully restrained her, by hugging her from behind and covering her mouth with his left hand.

2       The accused is now appealing against the sentence that I had imposed, namely, an imprisonment term of five years' and nine months. Due to his age, he was not eligible to be caned.

## The charges

3       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge, namely that he,

> “ …. on the 25th day of October 2021, at or about 6.10am, at the footpath along Jalan Loyang Besar, Singapore, did use criminal force on \[the Victim\], to wit, by grabbing her right breast (over clothes) with your right hand, intending to outrage her modesty, and in order to commit the offence, you did wrongfully restrain her, to wit, by hugging her from behind and covering her mouth with your left hand, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)”

4       The accused understood the nature and consequence of his plea. He was aware of the Prosecution’s sentencing position but maintained his plea of guilty. Counsel for the accused likewise confirmed this.

## Statement of Facts

5       The accused admitted to the statement of facts without qualification.

6       In the early hours of 25 October 2021, the Victim boarded the train at Changi Airport Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) station, heading home after work. Meanwhile, the accused, who had spent the night at Changi Airport to watch aeroplanes and enjoying the air conditioning was on the same train as the Victim. The Victim noticed him sitting opposite her and stealing glances at her.

7       The Victim alighted at Tanah Merah MRT station and transferred to another train heading towards Pasir Ris MRT Station. The Victim again noticed the accused sitting opposite her.

8       The Victim alighted from the train at Pasir Ris MRT station and took the lift down from the train platform. The accused took the same lift as her. After exiting the lift, the Victim then walked towards Pasir Ris bus interchange and waited at the bus berth for bus service 354. The Victim noticed the accused limping as he walked towards the same bus berth.

9       The Victim boarded the bus when it arrived. She sat next to the window at the front left part of the bus. The accused took a seat behind the bus driver at the front right of the bus. As passengers got off the bus, the accused came over and sat opposite the victim. He struck up a conversation with the Victim, but the Victim stopped talking after a while as she felt that something was amiss.

10     At about 0610 hours, the Victim alight at the bus stop in front of Bluwaters 2 condominium and started to walk towards it on a footpath. She noticed that the accused was walking behind her. As the Victim was looking for keys in her bag, the accused hugged her from behind and covered the Victim’s mouth with his left land. With his right hand, the accused grabbed the Victim’s right breast over her dress.

11     As the Victims and the accused struggled, the Victim fell face forward onto the ground and the accused landed on top of her, causing the Victim to graze her left knee, right hand, and left lip when she hit the ground. As the Victim had fallen forward, the accused hand was now underneath her as she lay on the ground. The accused kept grabbing the Victim’s breast. The Victim continued to struggle and scream. After about a minute, the accused got off the Victim and left the scene.

12     The Victim continued to shout for help and several passers-by assisted her. The complainant, a resident of Bluwaters 2 condominium also went to help. He called for police assistance at about 0625 hours. The Victim pointed in the direction of the Victim and the complainant proceeded to follow the accused from a distance. At about 0710 hours, the accused was arrested by police officers at Block 470, Pasir Ris Drive 6.

13     Meanwhile, the Victim was examined at SingHealth Polyclinic and the following injuries were noted:

> (a)     1 cm superficial abrasion over the left upper lip;

> (b)     2 small linear scratches over her right shoulder;

> (c)     Multiple small superficial scratches over right little finger; and

> (d)     Superficial abrasion over the anterior aspect of left knee.

## Antecedents

14     The accused has numerous antecedents. These began in 1986 when he was still a juvenile.

## Sentencing submissions and plea in mitigation

### Prosecution’s sentencing submission

16     The Prosecution sought a sentence of between five years’ and nine months’ imprisonment and six years’ and nine months’ imprisonment for the single charge of aggravated OM.

#### Sentencing framework for s 354A(1) offences

17     In _PP v BDA_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 72</span> (“BDA”), the High Court applied the two-step sentencing framework developed in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> (“_Terence Ng_”) and _GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> (“_GBR_”) to offences of aggravated OM.

18     The first step would be to consider the following non-exhaustive categories of offence specific factors:

> (a)      The degree of sexual exploitation. The Prosecution had assessed to be high. The accused had approached the victim from the behind. He had covered her mouth and grabbed her breast with the other hand. He had continued to grab the Victim’s breast for an extended period about a minute even after they had fallen on to the ground and she was screaming for help;

> (b)      Circumstances of the offence. It was submitted that the offence was clearly premeditated and involved violence. He had followed the Victim from Changi Airport MRT station to where she lived. This involved taking two different MRT train rides and a bus ride. The offence as committed in the early hours of the morning (ie. 0600 hours). In addition, the accused had physically restraint the Victim, causing her to fall on the ground where he continued to outrage her modesty whilst he was on top of her;

> (c)      Harm caused. The Victim suffered abrasions on her left hip, right shoulder, right little finger and left knee.

19     After considering these factors, the offence will be placed within the appropriate sentencing band. The sentencing bands for aggravated OM outrage are set out in _BDA_ at \[75\] – \[78\]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="15.3830766153231%"><col width="57.6915383076615%"><col width="26.9253850770154%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases which do not present any (or at most one) of the offence-specific aggravating factors, for example, cases that involve a fleeting touch or a touch over the clothes of the victim, and do not involve the intrusion into the victim’s private parts.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 – 4 years’ imprisonment, with 3 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases with two or more of the offence-specific aggravating factors. At the lower end of the band would be cases in which there was an absence of skin-to-skin contact with the private parts of the victim, for example, if the touching occurred over the victim’s clothes. At the higher end of the band would be cases involving skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts or sexual organs.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 – 7 years’ imprisonment, with 6 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases which, by reason of the number of the offence-specific aggravating factors, present themselves as the most serious instances of outrage of modesty. These would include cases such as those involving the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 – 10 years’ imprisonment, with 12 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

20     The Prosecution submitted that given the offence- specific aggravating factors, the present case fell within the lower end of Band 2. This would give an indicative starting sentence of four to five years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

21     Next, the Prosecution considered the following offender-specific aggravating or mitigating factors.

> (a)     It was accepted that the accused’s timeous plea of guilt was a relevant mitigating factor;

> (b)     However, it was highlighted that the accused had two previous convictions for similar OM charges. These are:[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

>> (i)       In 2003, the accused was convicted, _inter alia_, on one count of aggravated OM and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane; and

>> (ii)       In 2009, he was convicted, _inter alia_, on two counts of aggravated OM and one count for OM and was sentenced to ten years’ corrective training with seven strokes of the cane.

22     Therefore, it was submitted that the indicative starting sentence should be adjusted upwards by 1.5 years’. This would give a sentencing range of 5.5 years to 6.5 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

23     As the accused cannot be caned, being above 50 years of age, it was submitted that an imprisonment term of three months should be imposed _in lieu_ of the six strokes of the cane (that would ordinarily be imposed) to compensate for loss the deterrent and retributive effect of caning (per _Amin Bin Abdullah v PP_ \[2017\] SGHC at \[59\]) (“_Amin_”).[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

24     Hence, the Prosecution proposed a sentence of between five years’ imprisonment and nine months’ imprisonment and six years’ and nine months’ imprisonment inclusive of the additional term of imprisonment _in lieu_ of caning.

### Plea in mitigation

25     The Defence urged the court to impose a sentence of imprisonment of not more than five years and six months’ imprisonment.

26     The Defence agreed with the Prosecution that the sentencing framework in _BDA_ would be applicable in the present case. It appeared that the Defence also agreed that this case fell within Band 2 of the sentencing framework. In reaching its proposed indicative starting sentence, the Defence cited two precedents, namely _PP v Rengasamy Manikandan_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 122</span> (“_Rengasamy_”) and the unreported decision in _PP v Kannan Sukumaran_ (DAC-908559-2020) (“_Kannan_”).

27     The following is a summary of the two cases:[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (a)      _Rengasa_ _my_. The offender in _Rengasamy_ was convicted for an offence of aggravated OM after trial. He was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and an additional three months’ imprisonment _in lieu_ of caning;

> It was submitted that the facts of this case were more egregious than the present case. The district judge had found a considerable degree of sexual exploitation which involved her private parts and the entire intrusion intense, intrusive and prolonged. Much force was used to wrongfully restrain the victim and the offender remained undeterred until members of the public came to her rescue. The victim in _Rengasamy_ was also found to have suffered from psychological harm in addition to physical harm.

> (b)      _Kannan_. The offender in Kannan pleaded guilty to one charge of aggravated OM and was, like the offender in _Rengasamy_, sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and an additional three months’ imprisonment _in lieu_ of caning.

> The Defence submitted that the facts of this case bore some resemblance to the present case in terms of sexual exploitation and harm. The offender approached the victim from behind as she was jogging. He then used his right arm to grab the victim across her chest from behind and used his right hand to squeeze the victim’s left breast (over her clothes). The one aggravating factor was in _Kannan_ was that the offender punched the victim once on her chest which caused her to fall to the ground and suffer a cut on her elbow.

28     Based on this, the Defence submitted that the appropriate indicative starting sentence was four years’ imprisonment.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

29     At this point in time, I should highlight an error in the Defence;s submission The offender in _Rengasamy_ was not sentenced to four years’ imprisonment, with an additional three months’ imprisonment _in lieu_ of caning as set out in the PIM at \[6\]. In fact, in _Rengasamy_ at \[51\], the court was of the view that the appropriate sentence was five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. However, in _Rengasamy_ at \[61\], the court explained that, as the accused had initially spent six months in remand before being bailed out, six months’ imprisonment was deducted from the sentence and a final sentence of four years’ and six months’ imprisonment, and six strokes of the cane was imposed.

30     The Defence conceded that the accused’s previous convictions for aggravated OM and OM warranted an uplift to the indicative starting sentence. Taking into account that the accused was suffering from Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood and impaired vision in both eyes,[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) the proposed sentence by the Defence was five years and three months’ imprisonment.

31     The Defence agreed that, as the accused cannot be caned, due to his age, an additional term of three months’ imprisonment should be imposed _in lieu_ of caning as the accused had used violence on the Victim in a public place.

32     Therefore, the final sentence submitted by the Defence was a sentence of five years’ imprisonment and six months’ imprisonment inclusive of the additional term of imprisonment _in lieu_ of caning.

## Decision on sentence

### The punishment prescribed by law

33     The punishment prescribed by law upon conviction for a charge of aggravated OM is as follows:

> **Outraging modesty in certain circumstances**

> **354A-(1)** Whoever, in order to commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence against any person under section 354, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to that person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death, instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 2 years and not more than 10 years and with caning.

### The sentencing framework for aggravated OM

34     I agree with and accept that the sentencing bands as pronounced in _BDA._ I note that both the Prosecution and Defence have also accepted this sentencing framework and have, in fact, used it to reach their proposed sentences.

35     I now consider the following offence-specific factors that are relevant and featured in the present case. Per _GBR_ at \[27\] – \[30\], these are, the degree of sexual exploitation, the circumstances of the offence, and the harm caused to the Victim.

#### Degree of sexual exploitation

36     This requires a consideration of where (as in which part of the body), how and for how long the victim was touched.

37     I do not disagree with what was highlighted by the Prosecution at \[8(a)\] of the PAS. The accused not only grabbed the Victim’s breast but continued to do so for about one minute when his hand was underneath her body after they fell on the floor. This is not a fleeting touch but was of quite substantial duration. It is within the realms of possibility that this touching could have persisted for a longer period of time had the Victim’s screams not attracted several passers-by who went over to assist her. Nonetheless, I accepted the Defence’s submission that the degree of sexual exploitation was not as egregious as that in _Rengasamy_

#### The circumstances of the offence

38     Likewise, I do not disagree with what was highlighted by the Prosecution at \[8(b)\] of the PAS. The level of premeditation in the present case was far more extensive than in _Rengasamy_. The accused had followed the Victim all the way from Changi Airport MRT station to the condominium where she lived. This required the accused to follow the Victim through two different MRT lines and a bus ride. He tried to speak to her on the bus but was rebuffed. He then followed her off the bus. The accused then took advantage of the situation when the Victim was momentarily inattentive to her surroundings as she searched for her keys in her bag. He then attacked her by hugging her from behind before grabbing her right breast over her dress with his right hand.

#### Harm to the Victim

39     In the present case, there is nothing to show that the Victim suffered any psychological injury. I note that the physical injuries suffered by the Victim are minor. It would appear that these injuries were mainly caused when the Victim fell face forward onto the ground during the course of the struggle. I agreed that the harm caused was less than the victim in _Rengasamy_.

### Indicative starting sentence

40     In _GBR_ at \[33\], the High Court held that where two or more aggravating factors are present, the case will almost invariably fall within Band 2 and caning will nearly always be imposed. In the present case, there were clearly more than two aggravating factors present. These factors included the touching of a victim’s private parts and the accused’s level of premeditation. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution and the Defence that the presence of these factors would place the case clearly within Band 2 of the sentencing framework, giving sentencing range of between four to seven years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane.

41     In _GBR_ at \[33\], the High Court also held that, _“at the lower end of the band would be cases in which there was an absence of skin-to-skin contact with the private parts of the victim_”. Accordingly, from the facts of the case, I agreed that this case, given the absence of skin-to-skin contact, fell at the lower end of Band 2 of the sentencing framework. I therefore adjudged that the indicative starting sentence in the present case to be four years’ imprisonment, and being in Band 2, six strokes of the cane. This is also in line with the Prosecution’s and Defence’s assessment.

### Offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors

#### Aggravating factors

42     The accused is a recalcitrant recidivist. As mentioned, he has numerous antecedents and these date back to 1986 when he was still a juvenile. His antecedents include two previous convictions for similar offences of OM. In May 2003, he was convicted on one count of aggravated OM and was sentenced to five years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. His most recent OM conviction was on 11 September 2009, when he was convicted, amongst other charges, on two counts of aggravated OM and one count of OM. He was sentenced to ten years’ Corrective Training and seven strokes of the cane. Despite this long period of incarceration, it did not deter him from committing further OM offences.

43     In fact, the accused did not even stay crime free for long. Less than six months after his release from prison, in February 2020, the accused committed an offence of housebreaking. He was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment with effect from 6 March 2020. He therefore committed the present offence of aggravated OM less than a year after being released. Accordingly, I was of the view that the present offence warranted a substantial uplift from the indicative starting sentence.

44     The Prosecution had proposed an uplift of one and a half years’ imprisonment[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7). The Defence conceded that an uplift from the indicative starting sentence would be appropriate but instead, proposed an uplift of one year and three months’ imprisonment to give a sentence of five years’ and three months’ imprisonment.[^8]

45     In light of the factors that I have highlighted above, I adjudged that the appropriate uplift in the present case to be two years’ imprisonment.

#### Mitigating factors

46     I am of the view that the only mitigating factor in the present case is the fact that the accused has chosen to plead guilty at the first available opportunity.

47     The Defence had highlighted that the accused was suffering from Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood and impaired vision in both eyes and this was a mitigating factor.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) Having considered the two medical reports put forward by the Defence, I adjudged that very little weight should be placed on the accused’s medical condition(s) as a mitigating factor. For example, I note that at \[29(c)) of the medical report from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) dated 11 November 2021, Dr Lim Shang Cong opined that there was no contributory link between the accused’s mental condition and the offence. In fact, it is the doctor’s opinion that the accused was likely to have been intoxicated around the time of the offence due to alcohol consumption along with tablets of Valium obtained from the black market and his IMH medication.

48     I was therefore of the view that a downward adjustment of no more than six months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

#### Sentence

49     Accordingly, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence at this stage of my assessment was five years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

### Sentence of imprisonment in lieu of caning

50     Both the Prosecution and Defence agreed that, as the accused is ineligible to be caned due to his age, an additional term of imprisonment ought to be imposed _in lieu_ of caning. Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the appropriate sentence was three month’s imprisonment _in lieu_ of caning.

#### Whether the sentence should be enhanced

51     In _Amin_ the High Court held the appropriate starting point is that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced unless there were grounds to justify doing so. The factors included the need to compensate for the deterrent and retributive effect of caning loss by the exemption (per _Amin_ at \[53 and \[59\])

52     At \[63\] in _Amin_, it was highlighted that deterrence is likely to be the dominant sentencing consideration behind the imposition of caning for offences impacting public order and social safety. This is exactly how the offence of aggravated OM could be characterized as. The offence was committed in a public place, as the Victim was walking home. Moreover, the incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, with few people around.

53     The accused’s offence of aggravated OM was particularly reprehensible. So was the manner in which it was committed. He effectively stalked the Victim on her entire journey home and attacked her in that brief moment when she was not paying attention to her surroundings. Women should be able feel safe walking anywhere in public at any time of the day without fearing that they would be molested, more so being physically restraint when such an act is committed on them.

54     I further note that, more pertinently, the accused had received sentences of caning for his two previous aggravated OM convictions. Despite being previously caned, this had failed to deter him. Specific deterrence is therefore paramount in the present case.

55     Accordingly, I agreed that there should be an enhancement to the sentence _in lieu_ of caning. This additional term of imprisonment would be effective in replacing the deterrent and retributive effect of caning that had been lost because of the accused’s age.

#### Duration of the enhancement

56     The court in _Amin_ was of the view that the extent of such enhancement should have some correlation to the number of strokes of the cane that an offender has been exempted from. At \[90\], the court set out the following indicative guidelines:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="39.9%"><col width="60.1%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Strokes avoided</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Enhancement</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to six strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to three months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Seven to 12 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to six months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 to 18 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">six to nine months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">More than 19 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Nine to 12 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

57     In my view, the facts of this case warranted an enhancement of a sentence at the upper end of the indicative sentencing range of “_up to three months’ imprisonment_”. Therefore, the proposed enhancement by the Prosecution of three months’ imprisonment _in lieu_ of the six strokes of the cane imposed was not inappropriate. As mentioned, a similar view was held by the Defence, and appropriately so.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

## Final sentence imposed

58     Therefore, the final sentence imposed on the accused is as follows:

> **Five years’ and nine months’ imprisonment**, **_inclusive of three months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning_**

59     In addition, I ordered that this sentence of imprisonment was to commence with effect from 25 October 2021, the date that the accused was arrested. He has been remanded since then as he had been unable to raise bail.

60     The accused is a recalcitrant offender. In view of his similar antecedents, and the manner in which the offence was committed, the sentence imposed on the accused was fair and appropriate. The Defence was in general agreement with a proposed sentence of four years’ and six months’ imprisonment inclusive of three months’ imprisonment _in lieu_ of caning. He does not deserve a lower sentence.

61     All considered, the sentence imposed could not be said to be manifestly excessive. However, the accused is dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, and he has, in person, filed a Notice of Appeal against sentence. The accused is presently serving sentence.
