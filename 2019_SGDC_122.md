>> v)    One burnt joint marked as **‘HAY-4’**

> 51.    On 16th November 2018, exhibit marked **‘HAY-1’** were sent to HSA for analysis.

> 52.    On 11th December 2018, Kwang Jia Yi, an Analyst with the IDL of HSA, issued one certificate under Section 16 of the MDA, bearing Lab No: ID-1832-02727-001 stating that exhibit ‘HAY-1’ was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.67 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.45 gram of methamphetamine.

> 53.    The accused has thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA.

## Antecedents

5       The accused had the following antecedents:-

> (a)     On 9 November 2004, the accused was placed on 18 months’ probation for robbery and theft charges;

> (b)     On 6 April 2006, probation was revoked as he had breached probation and committed further theft and housebreaking offences. A 24 month stay at a juvenile home was ordered;

> (c)     On 29 March 2010, he was convicted of being a member of an unlawful assembly and for drug trafficking. He was ordered to undergo reformative training; and

> (d)     He was also ordered to be placed in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre on two occasions i.e. on 12 December 2013 and 5 August 2015.

## Mitigation

6       In his written mitigation, the accused stated that prior to his arrest he was a part-time delivery driver and was studying for a Diploma Course in Marine Offshore Engineering. He expressed his wish to continue with his studies.

7       The accused has 2 older siblings. His aged parents were showing signs of ill health. He took responsibility by taking care of the chores and contributing towards the family’s constrained finances. He was determined to stay on the right side of the law and to take care of his aging parents. He expressed the hope that he could achieve his goals and be a better person in the future.

## General considerations

8       The primary sentencing consideration was general deterrence. Specific deterrence was also a factor as the accused had committed multiple offences. The principle of deterrence would take precedence over rehabilitation as the accused was already about 26 years old at the time he committed the offences.

9       The bulk of the accused’s mitigation related to his personal circumstances and little weight could be placed on this. However, I took into account the fact that the accused was remorseful and had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity.

10     The prosecution did not seek to rely on any aggravating factors.

## The individual sentences

11     In sentencing the accused, the court had first to determine the appropriate individual sentence for each offence, before deciding on which of the individual sentences should run consecutively, so as to derive the appropriate aggregate sentence.[^1]

### Minimum sentences were passed for offences relating to LT-1 drug consumption and for housebreaking

12     I imposed the minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for the LT-1 drug consumption charge. I also imposed the minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment for the charge of housebreaking and theft by night (“housebreaking”) punishable under s 457 of the Penal Code. There is therefore no reason for the accused to be dissatisfied about these individual sentences.

### Charge under s 333 of the Penal Code

13     The offence under s 333 of the Penal Code for causing grievous hurt to a public servant (“grievous hurt”) is a serious offence. The prescribed punishment is a term of imprisonment of up to 15 years and also liability to a fine and caning.

14     The accused’s culpability was not low. When he was approached by the victim and other police officers, he resisted arrest and struggled violently. The harm caused was fairly serious. A fracture had been caused to the victim’s fifth toe and the victim was given one month’s medical leave.

15     In _Public Prosecutor v GCA_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 28</span> (“_GCA_”), the offender was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment for an offence under s 333 of the Penal Code. This is the only available sentencing precedent. The offender had kicked the right hand of a public servant, causing a soft tissue injury of the right thumb and a contusion of the hand. The victim was given medical leave of 21 days, during which time he was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. While the appeal in _GCA_ has not been heard, this case illustrates that stiff deterrent sentences will be imposed when grievous hurt is caused to public servants.

16     The injury caused in the present case was even more severe than in _GCA_ as the victim suffered a fracture and was given a longer period of medical leave. The prosecution’s submission that a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment should be imposed was reasonable, since this was substantially shorter than the sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment meted out in _GCA_.

### Sentences for other individual offences

17     The sentences passed for the other individual offences are as stated below.

18     A sentence of one year’s imprisonment was imposed for each of the 3 drug possession offences. I noted that the quantity of drugs seized was small and I passed a sentence within the usual sentencing range. It should also be noted that for DAC 941373-2018 (possession of methamphetamine), it was an aggravating factor that the accused had committed the offence after he had been released on court bail. However, the prosecution did not seek an uplift of sentence on that account and no uplift of sentence was imposed. Neither was an uplift of sentence imposed on account of the multiple drug possession charges.

19     For the 2 theft offences, a short custodial sentence was appropriate in view of the accused’s antecedents and as there were multiple charges of theft. I therefore imposed a short custodial sentence of one month’s imprisonment per charge.

20     For the offence of criminal trespass which is punishable under s 447 of the Penal Code, the offence was not aggravated as it was not alleged that the accused had trespassed in order to commit a crime. Although a fine could ordinarily be imposed, I was of the view that instead of imposing an additional penalty, a short custodial sentence which would run concurrently with the other sentences would serve the ends of justice. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment.

21     As all the sentences for these other charges were ordered to run concurrently, the individual sentences did not ultimately have an impact on the totality of sentence.

## Sentences ordered to run consecutively

22     In general, where unrelated offences are committed, sentences should run consecutively as the offender should be separately punished for each offence.[^2] The only related offences were the 6th charge (drug consumption) and the 11th and 14th charges (drug possession) which were committed at or around the time of the accused’s arrest on 30 June 2018. All the other offences were separate and distinct and should as a general rule run consecutively as they involved the invasion of different legally protected interests.

23     In calibrating the appropriate aggregate sentence, the court had to consider whether the overall sentence would be just and proportionate.[^3] If all the sentences were to run consecutively, this would have resulted in a disproportionate and crushing overall sentence. There was however still a need to have a sufficiently deterrent sentence to reflect that the accused had pleaded guilty to 9 charges and had given his consent to have another 16 charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. I was of the view that on balance, it was appropriate to run the sentences relating to LT-1 drug consumption, housebreaking and causing grievous hurt consecutively. The end result was that the accused would serve a total of 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, and receive the mandatory minimum 3 strokes of the cane for the LT-1 drug consumption offence.

## Conclusion

24     Considering the overall criminality of the accused, the total sentence was proportionate to the crimes he had committed and cannot be said to be manifestly excessive.
