Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Statutory Offences – Sentencing offences under section 50Y and 50T of the Prisons Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9124/2021/01.

7 June 2021

### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

## Background

1       Mr Mohammed Rafi s/o Abdul Latif pleaded guilty to a series of charges. Sentence was passed after considering the facts, his mitigation, and the applicable precedents. Mr Rafi has since filed an appeal against the sentence. I now set down the grounds for my decision on his sentence.

## Charges

2       Mr Rafi faced a total of 11 charges. In summary, Mr Rafi had, in chronological order, gone back to abusing drugs (1st LT2 committed some time before 3 September 2019), gone missing from the residence approved for his stay after he was granted an early release on remission for earlier offences, and defaulted on his urine test supervision regime (for which he faced three charges). He was re-arrested by chance more than 5 months later at night on 21 February 2020 when police officers on patrol found him behaving suspiciously. He was found to have stolen a t-shirt from a nearby supermarket. A check also found numerous bottles of various alcoholic spirits in his possession which he could not account for. With his eyes blood shot, and his speech slurred, he was sent for a urine test. His urine samples were then found to be positive again (2nd LT2 committed on or before 21 February 2020). Subsequent investigations also found that he was involved in three other property related offences committed on various dates while on the run. Mr Rafi was then 49 years old.

3       After Mr Rafi was charged in court, his matter was adjourned several times to accommodate his CLAS application, and for the review of the representations by his CLAS counsel. When he continued to elect to claim trial to his LT2 drug consumption charge, his CLAS counsel discharged, and he went through the CCDC process on his own. The matter eventually reached trial before me. On the trial day itself (22 April 2021), Mr Rafi indicated instead that he wished to change his plea position and admit to all his charges. The prosecution then proceeded on 5 charges: (1) the Remission Order breach charge; (2) one urine test default charge; (3) the fraudulent possession charge for the bottles of alcohol; (4) the 2nd LT2 drug consumption charge; and (5) one of the property related charges for the misappropriation of a handphone. Mr Rafi accepted the prosecution’s offer and pleaded guilty to the 5 charges, and also admitted to the other 6 charges and consented to having them being taken into consideration for the purposes of his sentencing. Mr Rafi was then 50 years old.

## Facts

4       The full statement of facts for the 5 proceeded charges runs into 9 pages. What follows is a summary.

## Remission Breach

5       Mr Rafi was released from prisons on 7 January 2019 under a Remission Order for an LT1 drug consumption offence. For the remission period from 7 January 2019 to 13 December 2020, he was required to reside at the approved residence at Selarang Halfway House (“SHWH”), and to comply with curfew hours between 10 pm every night till 6 am the next morning. Mr Rafi acknowledged the Remission Order and its conditions and complied for a period, but ultimately still went missing and failed to return when his time-off expired on 4 September 2019. The authorities made multiple calls to him, and sent multiple messages on various platforms to him, but he only responded at 10.16 am the next day explaining that he did not return as he was searching for his medical certificate. He later changed and indicated that he could not return because he was still waiting for his wife to get home from work. He then became uncontactable thereafter until his arrest more than 5 months later on 21 February 2020 by the patrol officers. This Remission Order breach formed the focus of the charge in MAC 901845/2020 under section 50Y(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, 2000 Rev. Ed.) for breaching curfew from 5 September 2019 to 21 February 2020, totalling 4058 hours and 25 minutes. Mr Rafi admitted that he was facing financial and family problems, and that he had no valid reason for failing to return. The prescribed penalty for this offence was up to 465 days imprisonment, i.e. the remaining duration of the Remission Order.

## Fail to Present for Urine Test

6       When Mr Rafi was released on the Remission Order, he was also placed under a drug Supervision Order on the same day. This Supervision Order required him to present himself to the Duty Officer at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters every Monday and Thursday (except where it fell on a public holiday) for urine tests for the next 24 months. Mr Rafi defaulted on this requirement after going missing, and the prosecution selected three different dates before his re-arrest to form charges under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Reg 3). One such charge was proceeded with and it involved the date of 6 February 2020, i.e. DAC 908587/2020. The prescribed penalty for this offence was up to 4 years’ imprisonment or fine of $10,000/- or both.

## Fraudulent Possession

7       Mr Rafi was re-arrested on the night of 21 February 2020 when two police officers on patrol found him to be behaving suspiciously at the Giant Hypermarket at Jurong East. He was unsteady in gait, had blood shot eyes, and was slurred in his speech. A total of 10 bottles of various alcoholic spirits were found in his possession, and which he was also unable to account for. No value was stated, but the 10 bottles comprised three champagnes and 7 wines. Being reasonably suspected to have been stolen, they formed the subject matter of the charge in MAC 904622/2020 for fraudulent possession under section 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, (Cap 184). The prescribed penalty for this offence was a fine not exceeding $3,000/-, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.

## Second LT2

8       After his arrest, Mr Rafi was subjected to a urine test. The HSA analysts found his urine samples to contain Monoacetylmorphine, a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185). This was a unique metabolite from the consumption of heroin (Diamorphine). Mr Rafi admitted smoking ‘ubat’ (the street name for heroin) using the chasing method at a HDB staircase landing somewhere in Jurong East prior to his arrest. He explained that he had relapsed because of peer pressure and that he was given small amounts of ‘ubat’ to smoke by these persons. This formed the subject matter of the second LT2 drug consumption charge in DAC 908586/2020. The prescribed penalty for this offence was a Minimum of 7 years’ imprisonment and a Maximum of 13 years’ imprisonment.

## Misappropriation

9       Subsequent screenings and investigations also established that Mr Rafi was involved in the misappropriation of a handphone a few weeks earlier on 14 January 2020. Mr Rafi had gone to the Boon Lay Social Service Centre that day, and seeing that a handphone was left on the counter unattended by the security officer there, proceeded to take it and leave. Mr Rafi admitted to the misappropriation after viewing the CCTV footage which captured his actions. This formed the subject matter of the misappropriation charge under section 403 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in MAC 905038/2020. The prescribed penalty for this offence was up to 2 years’ imprisonment, or with fine, or both.

10     Apart from the prescribed penalties set out above, each offence also attracted an enhanced penalty under section 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, 2000 Rev. Ed.) because they were all committed by Mr Rafi during his Remission Period.

11     Mr Rafi indicated that he understood the Statement of Facts when they were read to him in court, and he admitted to them without any qualification. He was accordingly found guilty and convicted on the 5 proceeded charges. The remaining 6 charges were then read to him, and he admitted to them and consented to having them being taken into consideration for the purposes of his sentencing.

## Antecedents

12     Mr Rafi was traced for both drug and property related offences. He had 9 previous convictions which were spread over 5 occasions, and they spanned the period 1998 to 2016. They showed an early involvement in drugs on his part, with his first ever conviction being for drug possession in 1998, for which he received a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. Not long after his release, his involvement in drugs escalated to trafficking in 2002, for which he received a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane. After that, he came back before the courts again in 2007 and 2011 for various property related offences. The last episode was in 2016 when he was dealt with for his LT1 drug consumption case and for which he received a sentence of 5 years 3 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. That sentence was served partially before he was released early on remission, and which he then proceeded to breach in the current spate of offences.

13     Apart from the above convictions, Mr Rafi also had 10 other drug consumption records spanning 1989 to 2019 for which he was variously admitted to DRC or placed under Drug Supervision. That last Supervision Order in 2019 was breached by him in the current spate of offences.

14     Mr Rafi admitted all his antecedents.

## Mitigation & Other Matters

15     Mr Rafi entered his mitigation orally. He explained that he did try to comply with the requirements in the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme conditions when he was placed on remission for his LT1 drug consumption case. He said that life during that period was not easy for him because he was working odd jobs and finances were tight as he had a family to support. He explained that he had to travel long distances between his work, attending to his family at Jurong, and going back to SHWH at the other end of the island at Changi, and had little time for rest as a result. He said that he tried his best, but he just could not keep up with the requirements. He said that he was remorseful and regretted his actions. He acknowledged that his LT2 drug consumption offence carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment which was already very harsh, and asked for the total sentence to not be much longer because that would result in him being separated from his family, and he explained that his younger son was already repeating secondary one and needed him. The other son was 18 years old and still in school, and both children were with his wife (whom he married in 1999) and who was working to support the family. On those counts – some of which were offered up only after some questioning from the court – Mr Rafi then pleaded for leniency and a lighter sentence.

16     Sentencing was then adjourned at the prosecution’s request to await the High Court’s guidance in dealing with cases involving sections 50Y and 50T of the Prisons Act. The significance of this was then explained to Mr Rafi who raised no objections; in fact, he also sought an adjournment of the sentencing so that he could continue to enjoy the more accommodative visitation rights of his remand status with his family during the upcoming Hari Raya period.

#### The Other Matters

17     When the proceedings resumed a few weeks later, Mr Rafi tendered a 14 page handwritten letter to the court, variously canvassing matters of mitigation, and somewhat contradictorily also asking for his plea on the Remission Order Breach and LT2 drug consumption charges to be retracted. When questioned by the court, Mr Rafi confirmed that he was aware of the letter’s contents as it was penned by him personally. A copy of the letter was then given to the prosecution, and the proceedings were then stood down to the afternoon to allow the prosecution to review and take a considered stance given its contents. When the proceedings resumed in the afternoon, the learned DPP gently probed Mr Rafi’s apparent reasons for wishing to retract his plea, and Mr Rafi then recanted on them altogether and said that he no longer wanted to retract his plea, and that the letter should be treated as mitigation only, and that he wished to have his sentencing concluded as soon as possible. The prosecution then indicated that sentencing should proceed.

18     My own review found no basis to question the validity of the plea entered by Mr Rafi. All the procedural safeguards stipulated in Part XI of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) were adhered to when Mr Rafi’s plea on the charges was entered. I now recount the events of that day. When Mr Rafi was brought to the court room, he indicated to the court officer that he no longer wished to claim trial to the LT2 drug consumption charge. I had then given instructions for the prescribed mandatory minimum penalty in the LT2 drug consumption charge to be specifically highlighted to him because it was serious. That was done in recognition that Mr Rafi was acting without counsel. Additionally, I also recognised that some accused persons may have many matters on their minds during such a critical juncture in the proceedings, and that they would benefit from all efforts made to highlight the consequences of their plea. When Mr Rafi confirmed that he understood and wished to plead guilty, the formal proceedings started in open court. Mr Rafi was calm and composed when he appeared before me. The LT2 drug consumption charge was read over to him again, and the prescribed penalty involving the mandatory minimum sentence was specifically explained to him again. Mr Rafi acknowledged that he understood the charge and its penalty, and entered a plea of guilty to the LT2 drug consumption charge. The proceedings were not rushed either because the learned DPP asked for time to prepare the rest of the papers. I then stood down the matter till the afternoon with instructions given to Mr Rafi to consider what he would like to say later for his mitigation. When we resumed later that day, Mr Rafi indicated that he was maintaining his guilty plea, and that he was accepting the prosecution’s offer to proceed on 5 charges. All 5 charges were then read over to him again, with the prescribed penalties explained to him again. Mr Rafi again indicated that he understood the charges and the penalties, and that he pleaded guilty to them. All the procedural safeguards were adhered to. As recounted earlier, Mr Rafi indicated that he understood the Statement of Facts which was read out in full, and he admitted to them without any qualification. He also indicated that he understood the prosecution’s application to have the remaining 6 charges taken into consideration for the purposes of his sentencing, and he admitted to those charges when they were read over to him and he consented to the application. He remained calm as his record was read, and he admitted to all his antecedents. He also proceeded to coherently offer up his mitigation, during which he again acknowledged that he was facing a heavy penalty from the charges which he had pleaded guilty to. At various points, he was also able to offer up coherent and relevant responses to queries which I posed. In the circumstances, it was clear that Mr Rafi was fully competent and cognisant, and I found no basis to question the validity of his plea.

19     I came to the above conclusion even after reviewing the matters which Mr Rafi raised in his handwritten letter to the court. Looking beyond the imprecision in the unnecessarily flowery and rambling prose, he essentially raised one objection: that the harsh LT2 penalty was unfair to him because other drug abusers were offered more lenient DRC Admissions instead (page 5). Objectively, that was a matter which was beyond the purview of the court, and given that the procedural safeguards were all scrupulously adhered to when his plea was taken, I found no basis to doubt that Mr Rafi was anything but clear as to the nature of the LT2 drug consumption charge and the consequences of his guilty plea to it. Taken together with Mr Rafi’s ultimate confirmation that he also wished to retract his retraction, I agreed that there was no impediment to sentencing proceeding. I now turn to explain my decision on his sentence.

## Decision on Sentence

20     Given that Mr Rafi’s offences involved both a Remission Order breach offence under section 50Y of the Prisons Act, and the other offences attracted enhanced sentences under section 50T of the Prisons Act, this court had regard to the sentencing framework laid down by the High Court in the case of _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v PP and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 102</span>. The first order was to determine the gravity of the Remission Order breach in his section 50Y offence, before considering in the round whether to impose any enhanced sentence for the other offences (starting from the most serious). To recap, the section 50Y charge in MAC 901845/2020 targeted Mr Rafi’s failure to abide by the mandatory aftercare conditions of his Remission Order by breaching curfew for a total period of 4058 hours and 25 minutes. I found that to be a substantial period running for more than 5 months. Additionally, I noted that his breach would have continued had he not been arrested by chance after being found incapacitated in a public place high on drugs (the second LT2 drug consumption charge). I reviewed but found no grounds to mitigate the severity of his breach here. In that regard, Mr Rafi admitted both in the Statement of Facts, and in his own letter, that he was fully aware of the mandatory aftercare conditions of his Remission Order. Further, he was also notified by the authorities to return, but wilfully did not and intentionally became uncontactable thereafter. In that regard, it is relevant to note that Mr Rafi’s letter at page 9, 10, and 12 explains why he went missing in the first place, i.e. he stated that he was subjected to a urine test after relapsing into drug abuse ‘due to stress’ – and that urine test was positive and it formed the subject matter of the first LT2 drug consumption charge which was TIC’d – and that he went missing thereafter because he “had a family to feed”. Mr Rafi’s breach took place in that context, i.e. he breached his Remission Order and stayed away from the authorities because he knew he had committed a serious offence by consuming drugs again, one which was exactly the same as the one he was placed under remission for. There was therefore little reason to regard his Remission Order breach with leniency given those circumstances.

21     I pause here to deal with some of the other matters which Mr Rafi raised in his letter to explain his breach. He claimed at page 3 that he was made to acknowledge the mandatory aftercare conditions in the Remission Order under “oppressive circumstances” because, in gist, his “wife and 2 children were waiting at a nearby bus stop”. I gather that he raised those circumstances in an attempt to lessen his culpability, but I saw no reason why that should be so. To start, it was not apparent how that amounted to oppression, nor was it even apparent why those circumstances were relevant to the full applicability of the mandatory aftercare conditions to him. It was plain from that account that Mr Rafi knew full well the conditions. He had in fact gone on to comply with those conditions, in his own words “every single day” (page 6), until his said relapse into drug abuse. There was thus no room to credibly claim either that he was in any way mistaken or unaware of the conditions. Together with the recount of the Remission Order and its conditions in the admitted Statement of Facts before the court, it was apparent that Mr Rafi’s section 50Y breach was nothing but wilful. I now turn to the second matter which he raised at page 8 of his letter, i.e. that he was not entirely to blame for his drug abuse relapse because the SHWH was awash with drug abusers and their drugs, and that sending him there was like putting “a fat diet person to work in a cake shop”. That position conveniently ignores one’s own accountability and I saw no credible basis for a court to lessen his culpability on such a reason; at most, it could only be said that Mr Rafi did try his best to comply, and did seemingly succeed for a period, and that he did not actively go out of his way to look for drugs for his relapse. I accepted that to be the case.

22     Even with that position adopted, it was my judgment that his rehabilitative prospects were dim. His antecedents showed a long and sustained involvement with drugs going back more than 30 years to 1989. Despite the repeated rehabilitative opportunities given to him by the authorities, he continued his involvement with drugs and even escalated it further, going from drug abuse to drug trafficking, before spilling over and branching out to various other property related offences. That sustained involvement and escalation took place even as he got himself into a relationship, became married, and fathered two sons along the way. None of that served to alter the path he trod. It was a track record which showed a trail of repeated broken promises all around, and it was plain, even as he stood before me, that Mr Rafi had still not obtained any meaningful insight into his actions and his personal responsibility for them. I say that because the mitigation letter he penned deflected blame for his situation and the predicament of his family to the authorities. The unvarnished position is that Mr Rafi has only himself to blame. He squandered the latest rehabilitative opportunity granted to him in his early release on remission to be with his family, and did not make good of himself to put things right and “feed his family”. In fact, he absconded from the SHWH because he had gone back to using drugs, continued to abuse drugs while on the run, and was found away from his family in a public place at night high in a stupor on drugs, after committing a string of other property related offences against various victims just to get by on his own because he was not in any regular gainful employment. It was a regrettably familiar repeated pattern where little real regard was being had for others – even his own kin. His drug use was exacting a high cost on himself and on those he crossed paths with, and it appeared undeterred even as progressively longer sentences were meted out to him. His current declaration before me of remorse and the promise of reform in his plea for yet another chance of leniency had to be therefore seen in that light. In my judgment, there was significant cause for concern over his rehabilitative prospects given the precious little evidence of any real lasting commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration.

23     All considered, I determined that the circumstances pointed to Mr Rafi’s Remission Order breach falling squarely within the High Severity Band 3. That was the same position which the prosecution submitted for, and I agreed that 85% (being the mean point of Band 3) of the remaining remission period should be imposed as the sentence for Mr Rafi’s Remission Order Breach; this led to a sentence of 395 days’ imprisonment for his section 50Y offence (85% of 465 days). That approach was consistent with the High Court’s approach in _Amanshah bin Omar v PP_ (MA 9790/2020) which applied the _Abdul Mutalib_ framework. In that case, the offender’s fresh offences and rehabilitation potential were similar to Mr Rafi’s. The difference lay in the curfew breach which totalled 279 hours and 25 minutes – a mere 6% fraction of Mr Rafi’s 4058 hours and 25 minutes. In that case, the High Court already pegged the severity of the offender’s breach at the higher end of Band 2 at 60% of the remaining remission period. The uplift I imposed on Mr Rafi was thus conservative and measured in that context.

24     Turning next to the LT2 drug consumption charge, this was the most serious of the fresh offences committed by Mr Rafi. It was similar in nature to the LT1 drug consumption offence for which he was placed under Remission, and his antecedents showed that specific deterrence was amply activated in this case. I considered that the guilty plea was entered exceedingly late at the trial itself, and that he had put the prosecution through the full exercise and expense of preparing for the trial to meet his (aborted) defence that the urine test results were unreliable. The prosecution made no submission before me that Mr Rafi’s actions in disputing his LT2 drug consumption charge and then admitting to it only after he turned 50 years old was somehow motivated by a desire to avoid caning. I found no reason to enquire further on the matter, and thus did not load Mr Rafi’s sentence on that count. I did however consider that this was his second LT2 drug consumption charge, and that there was another earlier LT2 drug consumption charge being taken into consideration for sentencing – that was the charge which preceded his Remission Order breach. Together with my assessment of his mitigation set out earlier, all of those points indicated that little credit could be given to Mr Rafi for his guilty plea. I recognised though that the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment already served to cater to much of the specific deterrence and incapacitation points, and that the additional uplift, together with the other two points mentioned, could be appropriately represented by 6 more months of imprisonment, and I so ordered.

25     I now explain the assessment for the enhanced sentence under section 50T for the LT2 drug consumption charge. The clear gravity of the LT2 drug consumption charge, its similarity to his earlier offending, and his modest rehabilitative prospects (as set out earlier) all combined to set the severity of his re-offending here squarely within the High Severity Band 3. However, I was mindful that the cumulative sentence for the enhanced portion under section 50T and his sentence under section 50Y could not exceed 465 days imprisonment. Accordingly, the enhanced sentence for committing the LT2 drug consumption offence during his remission period was thereby capped at 70 days imprisonment (465 days minus 395 days), and I so ordered. I found that enhancement to be entirely measured given the 7 years and 6 months imprisonment sentence arrived at earlier for the LT2 drug consumption charge itself, and that the enhancement did not thereby offend the totality principle for this offence. I found this to be entirely measured given that the prescribed penalty for a LT2 drug consumption offence was up to a maximum of 13 years’ imprisonment.

26     Given that the full remaining remission period had been consumed by Mr Rafi’s section 50Y offence and the enhancement outcome for his LT2 drug consumption charge, there was thus no need to consider imposing enhanced sentences for the remainder of his offences. I now turn to explain the sentencing for them.

27     Mr Rafi’s failure to present himself for his urine tests was a serious breach of his drug Supervision Order. It came in the context of him defaulting on his Remission Order after he had gone back to drug use. It had to be considered that he absconded from the Drug Supervision regime for an extended period, and it was evident that it would have continued had he not been arrested by chance. To his credit though, he pleaded guilty and this was his first such offence, and I counted them in his favour. Considering the circumstances and the fact that another two similar charges were being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, I determined that 6 months’ imprisonment for this charge was appropriate and so ordered. That term of imprisonment is within the range for similar cases like this. I found this to be entirely measured given that the prescribed penalty provided for this offence was up to 4 years’ imprisonment or fine of $10,000/- or both.

28     When Mr Rafi was arrested by the patrol officers, they found 10 bottles of various alcoholic spirits with him. Those bottles were reasonably suspected to be stolen, and he was unable to account for his possession of them. In his mitigation letter, he explained the nature of the offence here, i.e. that he “resorted to theft shoplifting (of wines) to sell for income to support my family” (at page 10). Though their exact value was not indicated before me, I considered that it was not insignificant since they comprised three bottles of champagnes and 7 bottles of assorted wines. Though he was traced for various property related offences, I did not count that against him as they were dated. His plea of guilt was also counted in his favour. Nonetheless, considering the theft charges which were being taken into consideration, the nature of the offending here, plus the quantity of the items involved, I found that the custodial threshold had been crossed. The prosecution submitted for at least 1 month’s imprisonment, and I agreed and so ordered. I found this to be entirely measured given that the prescribed penalty for Fraudulent Possession was a fine not exceeding $3,000/- or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.

29     The last proceeded charge involved Mr Rafi’s misappropriation of a handphone. To recap, Mr Rafi had gone to the Boon Lay Social Service Centre on 14 January 2020, and seeing that a handphone was left on the counter unattended by the security officer there, proceeded to take it and leave. That handphone was never recovered. Although its value was not indicated before me, I found that the gravamen of the offending here related more to the nature of the item misappropriated, rather than its exact monetary value. The consequences of the loss to the victim – in being cut off from all his contacts and services, and having to attend to the cancellation/suspension and resumption of various services/accounts – are considerable. It was entirely regrettable as well that others of modest means were being targeted by Mr Rafi for his own benefit. I noted as well that another similar misappropriation charge involving another handphone was also being taken into consideration. All of these points outweighed his guilty plea and the fact that he was hitherto untraced for such an offence. All considered, I determined that the custodial threshold had been crossed. The prosecution submitted for at least 1 month’s imprisonment, and I agreed and so ordered. I found this to be entirely measured given that the prescribed penalty for misappropriation was up to 2 years’ imprisonment, or with fine, or both.

30     In summary, the individual sentences arrived at for each of the 5 proceeded charges were as follows:

31     Looking at the 5 offences, I found them to fall into 3 distinct categories: (1) his remission breach, (2) his drug related offences; and (3) his property related offences. Minimally, these distinct components should be represented in the aggregate sentence since they each involve different legally protected interests. I considered Mr Rafi’s ultimate guilty plea, and determined that some credit could be given on that count by running some of the sentences concurrently. In the end, I ordered the sentence in the Remission Order Breach charge, the LT2 drug consumption charge, and the Misappropriation of handphone charge to run consecutively, and ordered that the sentence in the Fraudulent Possession charge, and the Failure to Present himself for Urine Test charge to run concurrently. The aggregate sentence was therefore 7 years, 7 months and 395 days imprisonment, and an enhanced sentence of 70 days imprisonment. In the round, given all the offences committed by Mr Rafi, I found the aggregate sentence to be commensurate, and that it did not offend the totality principle. As a result, no further adjustments were made.

32     After the sentencing, Mr Rafi filed an appeal the next day. In doing so, he also submitted a letter addressed to the High Court about his case, and that letter was forwarded to me for review. That letter formed no part of the consideration before me given the stage at which it was received. Anyway, it appears from that letter that Mr Rafi is attempting to revive his retraction of his guilty plea, and that he will be making various allegations about how his plea was entered. I have explained that aspect, and can do no more than to let the record of the proceedings speak for itself. Before me, Mr Rafi was afforded every courtesy and procedural safeguard, and then some. His plea was accepted in that context, and he was sentenced in that context.
