### Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun:

## Introduction

1       The joint trial concerned two accused persons, Lieutenant Chong Chee Boon Kenneth (“**LTA Chong**”) and Senior Warrant Officer Nazhan Bin Mohamed Nazi (“**SWO Nazhan**”), who were the commander and deputy commander of ROTA 3 of Tuas View Fire Station respectively at the material time of the incident.

2       At the commencement of the trial, both accused persons were each charged with one count of abetment by intentionally aiding a group of servicemen from ROTA 3 of Tuas View Fire Station to commit the offence under s 338(_a_) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“**Penal Code**”) of causing grievous hurt to Kok Yuen Chin (“**CPL Kok**”) by doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life. The accused persons had allegedly done so by illegally omitting to prevent the group of servicemen from making CPL Kok enter a 12-metre-deep pump well. The original charges proceeded were as follows:

> “You…**Chong Chee Boon Kenneth**…are charged that you, on 13 May 2018, sometime between 9.00pm and 9.07pm, at 103 Tuas South Avenue 3, Tuas View Fire Station, Singapore, as Commander of ROTA 3 of the said fire station, did abet by intentionally aiding a group of servicemen from ROTA 3 of the said fire station to commit the offence of causing grievous hurt to Kok Yuen Chin (male / 22 years old / NRIC No.: XXX) by doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life, by illegally omitting to prevent the said group of servicemen from making the said Kok Yuen Chin enter a 12-metre-deep pump well, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 338(a) read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

> “You…**Nazhan Bin Mohamed Nazi**…are charged that you, on 13 May 2018, sometime between 9.00pm and 9.07pm, at 103 Tuas South Avenue 3, Tuas View Fire Station, Singapore, as Deputy Commander of ROTA 3 of the said fire station, did abet by intentionally aiding a group of servicemen from ROTA 3 of the said fire station to commit the offence of causing grievous hurt to Kok Yuen Chin (male / 22 years old / NRIC No.: XXX) by doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life, by illegally omitting to prevent the said group of servicemen from making the said Kok Yuen Chin enter a 12-metre-deep pump well, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 338(a) read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

3       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Prosecution had not proved the original charges under s 338(_a_) read with s 109 Penal Code against both of the accused persons. Nonetheless, there was sufficient evidence that would establish a charge under s 336(_b_) Penal Code against each of the accused person. Therefore, the court exercised its power under s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“**CPC**”) to frame an amended charge against the accused persons. LTA Chong pleaded guilty to the amended charge while SWO Nazhan pleaded not guilty. After hearing further submissions from SWO Nazhan’s counsel, Mr Retnam, I similarly convicted SWO Nazhan of the amended charge under s 336(_b_) Penal Code. Both LTA Chong and SWO Nazhan were each sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment.

4       Being dissatisfied with the decision, the Prosecution has appealed against the order to amend the charge to s 336(_b_) Penal Code or in the alternative, the acquittal of the charge under s 338(_a_) read with s 109 Penal Code for both accused persons. SWO Nazhan has filed an appeal against the conviction of the amended charge and the sentence, and is now currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal. LTA Chong did not wish to file any appeal against his sentence and decided to commence serving his sentence immediately. In view of the appeals, I shall now provide the full grounds of my decision below.

## Background Facts

5       The charges against the accused persons arose out of an incident on 13 May 2018 at Tuas View Fire Station. A group of ROTA 3 officers of Tuas View Fire Station had gathered at the watch room to celebrate CPL Kok’s impending exit from National Service upon reaching his Operationally Ready Date (“**ORD**”). During the celebration in the watch room, some of the servicemen had shouted “Kolam” suggesting that CPL Kok should enter the pump well. After the celebration in the watch room had ended at about 9.00pm, CPL Kok was carried by a few of the ROTA 3 servicemen towards the direction of the pump well, which was located about 20 metres away from the watch room. The pump well had a depth of about 12 metres and an internal diameter of about 1.8 metres. At the material time, the water level in the pump well was about 11 metres.

6       While CPL Kok was being carried to the pump well, LTA Chong had remained in the watch room. The servicemen eventually put him down before the pump well before they continued egging and teasing him to enter the pump well. At one point, LTA Chong looked out of the window and saw the servicemen at the pump well. He shouted towards the group of servicemen and instructed them not to film. SWO Nazhan was seen near the pump well together with the rest of the group of servicemen. At the pump well, CPL Kok took out his wallet and handphone and passed it to one of the servicemen for safekeeping. He was also observed to be removing his polo t-shirt, his boots and socks. While CPL Kok was removing his personal belongings, SWO Nazhan left the pump well and went back to his office.

7       Within a few minutes after SWO Nazhan had left the pump well, CCTV footage revealed that SSGT Mohammad Nur Fatwa bin Mahmood (“**SSGT Fatwa**”) followed behind WO Mohamed Farid bin Mohd Saleh (“**WO Farid**”) and suddenly pushed CPL Kok forcefully on his back. As a result of the push, CPL Kok fell into the pump well and submerged into the water without surfacing for air. A few of the servicemen quickly jumped into the well to try to locate CPL Kok but to no avail. CPL Kok was only located after sufficient water from the pump well was pumped out. He was later conveyed to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital _via_ an ambulance, and pronounced dead at the hospital at 11.02pm. At the material time of the incident, CPL Kok did not know how to swim.

## Case for the Prosecution

8       The Prosecution set out in their closing submissions the following elements required in order to prove the charge of abetment by illegal omission of a rash act causing grievous hurt:[^1]

> (a)      _Actus reus_: The ROTA 3 servicemen had committed a rash act by making CPL Kok enter the pump well either by himself or by the use of physical force.

> (b)      _Mens rea_: The ROTA 3 servicemen were either subjectively conscious of the risk, or the risk was so obvious that the servicemen ought, as reasonable persons, to have known of it.

> (c)     Causation: The rash act of making CPL Kok enter the pump well either by himself or by the use of physical force caused grievous hurt.

> (d)     Abetment: The accused persons intentionally aided the commission of the rash act causing grievous hurt through their omission to intervene.

### The ROTA 3 servicemen committed the primary offence under s 338(a) Penal Code

9       According to the Prosecution, the ROTA 3 servicemen were making CPL Kok enter the pump well by taunting him to enter the pump well while they were in the watch room, carrying him to the pump well, and egging him on to enter the pump well while they were near it.[^2] Based on these acts, the Prosecution argued that the servicemen had intended to make CPL Kok enter the pump well.[^3] This is further supported by the conduct of the servicemen immediately preceding and immediately after SSGT Fatwa had pushed CPL Kok into the well.[^4]

> (a)     Before the push, the servicemen did not put a stop to the “Kolam” activity even when CPL Kok had repeatedly objected to entering the pump well. Instead, they continued to goad CPL Kok to enter the pump well because they had wanted him to enter.[^5]

> (b)     After the push, the servicemen did not express any disbelief or shock at SSGT Fatwa’s act. The CCTV footage showed that the servicemen were laughing or smiling moments after CPL Kok was pushed into the well.[^6]

10     Next, the Prosecution contended that the ROTA 3 servicemen had committed a rash act as they were either subjectively conscious of the risk posed by making CPL Kok enter the pump well, or that the risk was so obvious that the servicemen ought, as reasonable persons, to have known of it.[^7] The Prosecution relied on the evidence of a few servicemen such as WO Mulifatullah Bin Atan (“**WO Mulifatullah**”), WO Farid and SSGT Ng Meng Kiat, Chris (“**SSGT Chris**”) who had testified on the risks that they were advertent to at the time “Kolam” activity was being carried out.[^8]

11     The Prosecution further argued that even if some of the servicemen may not have subjectively appreciated the risks involved, this does not absolve them of having the requisite _mens rea_ as consciousness of risk can be either subjective or objective. The Prosecution cited the case of _Jali bin Mohd Yunos v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1059</span> which held that in the context of road traffic offences, consciousness as to risk includes situations in which the risk is so obvious that the accused ought, as a reasonable person, to have known of it inasmuch as he had paused to consider it, it would have been artificial to have ignored such a risk.[^9]

12     Here, the Prosecution contended that making CPL Kok enter the pump well involved a “blatantly obvious risk” that CPL Kok would suffer some form of injury that it would be artificial to ignore it.[^10] The Prosecution sought to rely on the following facts to demonstrate that the act of making CPL Kok enter the pump well involved a “blatantly obvious risk”:[^11]

> (a)     The pump well had a depth of 12 metres and a metal railing which served as a safety measure to prevent servicemen from accidentally falling into the pump well. While the servicemen did not know the exact depth of the well, they knew it was deep as they had never once extracted sufficient water for the floor of the pump well to be visible.

> (b)     The water in the pump well was murky and opaque, and thus there would be poor visibility for persons submerged in the pump well as well as for persons looking in. As the “Kolam” activity was conducted at night with no light sourced aim at the pump well, the visibility was even poorer.

> (c)     At least two of the servicemen, SSGT Al-Khudaifi Chang (“**SSGT Al-Khudaifi**”) and SSGT Muhammad Riduan Bin Mohamed Sairi (“**SSGT Riduan**”), knew that CPL Kok did not know how to swim, while the rest did not know whether or not CPL Kok could swim. At the pump well, SGT Mohammad Hazwan bin Hassan (“**SGT Hazwan**”) had asked CPL Kok whether he could swim and CPL Kok replied that he could not swim. This exchange was heard by at least two other servicemen, SSGT Al-Khudaifi and Mohammad Lokman bin Saibul Bari (“**SSGT Lokman**”).

13     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the act of making CPL Kok enter the pump well caused the grievous hurt as they had intended for CPL Kok to enter the pump well “one way or another”.[^12] Up to the point SSGT Fatwa pushed him in, the servicemen were unrelenting in their bid to get CPL Kok to enter the pump well. The Prosecution highlighted that not a single serviceman, including the accused persons, could point to an incident where similar acts of taunting, carrying and goading a target to enter the pump well was a mere tease that did not end up with the target entering the pump well. Based on the incidents recounted in court, the target entered the pump well “one way or another”.[^13]

14     In terms of causation, the legal test is whether the act was the “proximate and efficient cause” of the death: _Ng Keng Yong v PP and anor appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 89</span> (“_Ng Keng Yong_”) at \[61\]. The chain of causation is not necessarily broken by a third party’s intervening act. In determining whether an accused’s rash act contributed significantly or substantially to the death, the factual matrix and the extent to which the third party’s act contributed to the death have to be assessed: _Ng Keng Yong_ at \[66\]. In order for an intervening act to break the chain of causation, the intervening act must have such “causative potency” that the initial rash act could not be said to have contributed significantly to the eventual outcome: _Ng Keng Yong_ at \[67\].

15     The Prosecution argued that the push by SSGT Fatwa was not extraneous.[^14] The push by SSGT Fatwa was merely the “mechanism” by which the servicemen’s intent to get CPL Kok into the pump well was achieved.[^15] According to the Prosecution, there was to be only one outcome that night –CPL Kok was to enter the pump well “by any means”.[^16] The push by SSGT Fatwa was not extraneous and did not break the chain of causation. The “ultimate intention” of the servicemen was for CPL Kok to enter the well, and SSGT Fatwa’s push “achieved exactly that”.[^17] Therefore, the servicemen’s act of making CPL Kok enter the pump well was the substantial cause of the grievous hurt.[^18]

### The accused persons abetted the primary offence under s 338(a) Penal Code by way of their illegal omission

16     The accused persons, as the commanders of ROTA 3, owed a duty of care to CPL Kok to keep him safe while he was on duty. Under cross-examination, LTA Chong accepted that as the ROTA commander, he was responsible for the safety of all the servicemen under his charge, including CPL Kok. This responsibility was his alone and could not be delegated.[^19] SWO Nazhan similarly agreed that the safety of the servicemen was of paramount concern to him while they are on duty in the fire station. This was so even when the servicemen were not undergoing training or performing duties.[^20]

17     In the context of an omission, the Prosecution’s submission was that an accused person’s awareness that an offence was being committed would be relevant in finding whether he had intentionally aided the offence by his omission to interference: _Balakrishnan S and anor v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 249</span> (“_Balakrishnan_”) at \[112\]. On the facts, the accused persons intended for the rash act of making CPL Kok enter the pump well to be committed, or were indifferent as to whether it was committed.[^21] The accused persons knew that the servicemen were subjecting CPL Kok to the “Kolam” ritual but had intentionally omitted to stop the “Kolam” activity from occurring.[^22]

#### LTA Chong

18     LTA Chong had been with the SCDF for over 14 years at the material time of the offence.[^23] The Prosecution relied on the following to establish LTA Chong’s state of mind:

> (a)     In his first statement to the police,[^24] LTA Chong stated that he saw the servicemen were making CPL Kok go into the well as part of the unofficial way of celebrating his ORD.[^25] Based on his memory, this type of celebration was banned about 10 years ago.[^26] In his cautioned statement,[^27] LTA Chong also stated that he knew the servicemen were bringing CPL Kok to the well when he saw them gathering at the pump well.

> (b)     In his further statement to the police,[^28] LTA Chong informed that he had expected CPL Kok to be made to go down into the well on his own on the 13 May 2018. He understood this to be a known type of celebration where the target would be made to go down into the well on his own. LTA Chong did not expect that CPL Kok would be pushed into the well.[^29] However, he accepted in court that there was a possibility that CPL Kok could be pushed into the well if someone had taken matters into his own hands.[^30]

> (c)     While LTA Chong was in the watch room, he opened the window which was initially closed shouted "no filming” at the servicemen. He knew the “Kolam” practice to be banned by SCDF and he did not want any recordings of it in Tuas View Fire Station.[^31] He remembered a group of the servicemen shouting back “no filming”.[^32] He could not recall who exactly was there at the pump well, although he recalled there were more than 10 servicemen.[^33]

> (d)     After informing the servicemen not to film, LTA Chong closed the window and turned his attention back to the watch room where he continued his conversation with SGT Mohamed Hanis bin Mohamed Hussain (“**SGT Hanis**”). He knew what they did was wrong but did not want to spoil their celebration mood.[^34] By turning away from the scene, the Prosecution argued that LTA Chong signalled to the servicemen his intention for the rash act to be committed, or at the very least his indifference as to whether the rash act would be committed.[^35]

#### SWO Nazhan

19     SWO Nazhan had also been with the SCDF for more than 14 years at the material time of the offence.[^36] The Prosecution relied on the following to establish SWO Nazhan’s state of mind:

> (a)     SWO Nazhan knew that “Kolam” was a celebratory ritual for persons entering and leaving the fire station.[^37] He understood that targets of “Kolam” activity were not always willing participants, and those who refused to walk to the pump well were carried there.[^38] SWO Nazhan was personally subjected to “Kolam” activity in Sengkang Fire Station. As a newcomer, he was informed by his seniors that in order to welcome him to be part of the “brotherhood”, he had to enter the “Kolam”.[^39]

> (b)     Based on his narration of the events in his statement,[^40] SWO Nazhan had no reason to doubt that the servicemen’s intention was to make CPL Kok enter the pump well. His evidence in court further confirmed that it was not a mere tease. About two to three duties before CPL Kok’s last day of duty, SWO Nazhan had heard someone shouted “Kolam” to CPL Kok.[^41] On the day itself, SWO Nazhan was in the watch room where some of the servicemen had used the word “Kolam”. After they were dismissed from the watch room, CPL Kok was carried by the servicemen to the pump well.[^42]

> (c)     While at the pump well, SWO Nazhan heard CPL Kok saying that he did not wish to enter the pump well.[^43] SSGT Fatwa testified that before SWO Nazhan left the vicinity of the pump well, he told CPL Kok that if he could not swim, he should jump nearer to the edge of the “Kolam”.[^44] This was corroborated by the CCTV footage[^45] where SWO Nazhan was seen looking in the direction of CPL Kok and pointing in the direction of the pump well. Under cross-examination, SWO Nazhan could not recall what he had said then.[^46] SWO Nazhan agreed that if CPL Kok were to enter the pump well, a push was one of the many ways in which he could do so.[^47]

> (d)     SWO Nazhan eventually left the pump well area and went back to his office. By doing so, the Prosecution argued that SWO Nazhan signalled to the servicemen his intention for the rash act to be committed, or at the very least his indifference as to whether the rash act would be committed.[^48]

## Case for the Defence

20     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found that the Prosecution had crossed the threshold required to make out a _prima facie_ case against the accused persons. Accordingly, the accused persons were called upon to enter their defence. Both of them elected to give evidence. Apart from both of the accused persons, there were no other defence witnesses.

### DW1 Chong Chee Boon Kenneth

21     LTA Chong gave evidence that as a matter of tradition, for an NSF who is about to ORD, there would usually be a gathering where the ROTA would present a token of appreciation to the NSF. They would celebrate the ORD with either a cake, or sometimes there will be food without cake.[^49] For CPL Kok’s ORD, SGT Hanis was the treasurer of the ROTA, and he was the one who had ordered the plaque and collected it prior to 13 May 2018. LTA Chong knew that the ROTA fund was used to pay for the plaque, and thus decided to use his own money to buy the cake.[^50] As the cake was not pre-ordered, he instructed a few servicemen to get the cake on the evening of 13 May 2018. There was no plan as to what was to be done after the ORD celebration.[^51]

22     During the celebration in the watch room, LTA Chong testified that the mood was joyous and it was noisy.[^52] He was not talking to anyone in particular, nor was he paying attention to any specific conversation.[^53] LTA Chong testified that he did not hear any mention of “Kolam” in the watch room as reflected in the transcript of the video footage in the watch room.[^54] In terms of language proficiency, LTA Chong informed that he could pick up one or two Malay words, but would not be able to understand Malay language in sentences or understand what the conversation is about.[^55] Looking at the transcript of the video footage in the watch room,[^56] LTA Chong felt that the servicemen was merely teasing CPL Kok. There was no plan to do something to CPL Kok at the end of the celebration.[^57]

23     After the celebration in the watch room ended, LTA Chong stayed behind in the watch room with SGT Hanis. Both of them were talking as SGT Hanis was cleaning the watch room floor.[^58] While LTA Chong was inside the watch room, he looked out of the window and saw a group of servicemen gathering around the pump well. He thought that they were having the “Kolam” activity which meant that someone would enter the pump well.[^59] LTA Chong shouted to the group “no filming” as he did not want any footage of the “Kolam” activity to be captured and circulated outside of the fire station.[^60] The group responded “no filming” in return.[^61] LTA Chong then closed the window and went back to talking to SGT Hanis in the watch room.[^62]

24     A few minutes later, LTA Chong left the watch room intending to go back to the admin office. As he walked past the pump well, he saw the group of servicemen at the pump well shouting CPL Kok’s name into the pump well. He also noticed WO Farid was removing his clothing and preparing to enter the pump well. When he asked the people around the pump well if CPL Kok went into the pump well, nobody answered him. Even after he dropped the stove lighter back at the office and went back to the pump well, he asked again whether CPL Kok had gone into the pump well but no one answered him.[^63]

25     LTA Chong’s counsel, Mr Wee Pan Lee, made the following key points of arguments in both his oral and written closing submissions:

> (a)     LTA Chong believed the servicemen had a strong brotherly bond and trusted that they would protect, care and support each other like brothers. As such, it was not a probable consequence that CPL Kok would be pushed. If CPL Kok were to enter the pump well, it would be on his own.[^64] The consensus and expectation of the ROTA 3 servicemen was for CPL Kok to enter the well willingly.[^65]

> (b)     The servicemen had only wanted to bring CPL Kok to the pump well and place him there. Their intention was to merely tease CPL Kok and “scare” him as part of the ORD celebration. With the exception of SSGT Fatwa, none of the other servicemen had intended to physically force CPL Kok to enter the pump well. The act of the servicemen in teasing and scaring CPL Kok is not an offence under s 338 Penal Code.[^66]

> (c)     The grievous hurt suffered by CPL Kok did not result from the act of making CPL Kok enter the pump well. Rather, it was caused by the sudden push by SSGT Fatwa which the witnesses agreed took them by surprise.[^67] SSGT Fatwa’s act of pushing CPL Kok broke the chain of causation because the push was a distinct rash act that was not anticipated by the rest of the servicemen, much less LTA Chong who was not at the scene.[^68]

> (d)     During the celebration in the watch room, the room was noisy and LTA Chong did not hear “Kolam” being mentioned.[^69] Neither could he hear the sounds from outside as he was inside the air-conditioned watch room and the windows were closed.[^70] While he had glanced out of the window and shouted “no filming”, the pump well area was not well illuminated and it would have been difficult to make out the identities of the ROTA 3 personnel.[^71]

> (e)     LTA Chong’s failure to prevent the “Kolam” activity was not an illegal omission. Most of the personnel did not immediately deem “Kolam” activity as ragging or dangerous unless it was progressing towards involuntariness.[^72] LTA Chong believed that CPL Kok would enter the pump well on his own, and in such a situation the risk level would be very low.[^73]

26     Therefore, Mr Wee submitted that the charge under s 338(_a_) read with s 109 Penal Code is not made out and that LTA Chong should be acquitted. Instead, a more probable offence would be one under s 336(_b_) Penal Code.[^74]

### DW2 Nazhan Bin Mohamed Nazi

27     SWO Nazhan testified that when he heard the servicemen using the words “Kolam” in the watch room, he thought that they were merely saying that to tease CPL Kok to go inside the “Kolam”. It was CPL Kok’s last day of duty, and everyone was in a mood to celebrate his ORD.[^75] Following the celebration in the watch room, SWO Nazhan testified that he had seen some of the ROTA 3 boys carrying CPL Kok towards the direction of the pump well as he was also walking behind them.[^76] CPL Kok was observed to be smiling and laughing when he was being carried to the pump well.[^77] They later put him down just before the pump well area.

28     When SWO Nazhan was standing around the pump well, he saw that they were not doing anything to him, and they were merely teasing him. They were not holding him, or doing anything that was forceful. CPL Kok did not look nervous or looked like he didn’t want to be there.[^78] When SWO Nazhan saw everything had quietened down and that they were not doing anything to him, he felt in his heart that it was just a prank because “boys will be boys” and they often played pranks among each other all the time.[^79] SWO Nazhan thought that CPL Kok was not going to go in.[^80] When he saw that everything was okay, he left for the office.[^81]

29     A few minutes after SWO Nazhan was back in his office and doing his work, LTA Chong came into the office and informed that CPL Kok could have “gone under”. SWO Nazhan then rushed off, following behind LTA Chong. When SWO Nazhan arrived at the pump well, SWO Nazhan saw a lot of people taking out rescue equipment. When he asked the group what happened, one of them had told him that CPL Kok fell into the pump well. Rescue operations were then carried out to locate CPL Kok.[^82]

30     The key points of defence put forth by the counsel for SWO Nazhan, Mr Singa Retnam, in his oral and written closing submissions may be summarised as follows:

> (a)     SWO Nazhan had only taken the same route as the rest of the servicemen as it was the same way to the admin office. The activity of the ROTA 3 servicemen before SWO Nazhan had left the scene was not ragging which was forbidden by SCDF.[^83] There were no publicity to indicate that “Kolam” activity is specifically forbidden.[^84] While there were posters put up indicating that ragging was forbidden, there was nothing which states that “Kolam” was forbidden as a form of ragging.[^85]

> (b)     Before SWO Nazhan had left the scene at the pump well, he observed that CPL Kok had been put down and was standing on the ground and everything was quiet.[^86] He merely thought that what was going on was teasing, and after CPL Kok was put on the ground that would be the end of the matter.[^87] SWO Nazhan had thought that nothing further was going to happen at the pump well, and would not have left the scene if anything further were to happen.[^88]

> (c)     There was no common intention by the group of servicemen to commit a rash act and cause grievous hurt to CPL Kok by making him go into the pump well. Neither could it be said that the group of servicemen had any prior knowledge that SSGT Fatwa was going to commit the rash act of pushing CPL Kok into the pump well.[^89] SWO Nazhan could not have anticipated or have reasonably foreseen what would have happened after he left the scene.[^90]

> (d)     While the practice of “Kolam” may mean that servicemen were made to enter the pump well, the Prosecution did not prove that what the servicemen had done was definitely to make CPL Kok go into the well. It cannot be assumed that the inevitable result of what happened that day would be that SSGT Fatwa would push CPL Kok and for the latter to suffer a fatal outcome.[^91]

> (e)     There was no rash act by the group of servicemen except for SSGT Fatwa alone. Carrying CPL Kok to the pump well and putting him down could not be considered a rash act.[^92] The sequence of events which led to CPL Kok’s death had started only after SWO Nazhan had left the scene.[^93] The rash act of causing grievous hurt was committed when SWO Nazhan was absent, which meant that he could not have intentionally aided the commission of the rash act.[^94]

> (f)     SWO Nazhan could not have known that the acts of the servicemen would have progressed into something that was fatal. Not a single “Kolam” activity has been proved to be fatal and there is nothing to suggest that there is grave risk involved.[^95] Based on SWO Nazhan’s own personal experience, he had gone into the pump well before as a non-swimmer and came out of the pump well without risk.[^96]

31     Mr Retnam urged the court to acquit SWO Nazhan of the charge proceeded against him. No alternative charge was proposed.

## Analysis and Court’s Findings

32     The charge proceeded against the accused persons can be broken down into two parts. First, the primary offence allegedly committed by the group of servicemen is the offence under s 338(_a_) Penal Code of causing grievous hurt to CPL Kok by doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life (the “Primary Offence”). Next, the secondary offence allegedly committed by the accused person is one of abetment of the primary offence by intentional aiding (the “Secondary Offence”). Each of the two parts are dealt with in turn.

### Primary offence – Causing grievous hurt by doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life

33     As the Prosecution had set out in their closing submissions, the group of servicemen had taunted CPL Kok to enter the pump well while they were in the watch room, carried him to the pump well, and egged him on to enter the pump well while they were near it.[^97] These acts by the servicemen, which had gone no further than taunting and egging CPL Kok to enter the well, merely suggest a desire for CPL Kok to go into the well. There was no concrete evidence of a common consensus among the servicemen that CPL Kok was to invariably enter the well that evening. Neither was there any discussion as to the means which the group of servicemen would employ as part of their desire for CPL Kok to enter the pump well. Therefore, I could not agree with the Prosecution that the servicemen were out to get CPL Kok into the well “by any means”.[^98] While the group of servicemen displayed an expectation for CPL Kok to enter the pump well, there was no agreement on how he was to enter the well.

34     It was undisputed that CPL Kok was carried for a distance until the servicemen decided to let him down before the pump well. At the pump well, they continued teasing him and egging him to go in. No further physical force was used. There was also no clear evidence of any common intention among the servicemen to cause CPL Kok to enter the well involuntarily, either by pushing him in or by other means. Their forbearance to apply further physical force to get CPL Kok into the pump well suggested that they were at least cautious not to cause any harm to CPL Kok while they were engaged in the “Kolam” activity. Hence, I could not agree with the Prosecution that the servicemen were “unrelenting in their bid” to get CPL Kok to enter the pump well.[^99] By placing him down at the well, the servicemen expressed that they were giving CPL Kok the chance to decide if he wanted to enter the well and how he wanted to enter the well.

35     Significantly, there is no clear definition as to what “Kolam” activity entailed. The facts of the case presented three different scenario possibilities – one where CPL Kok enters the well voluntarily, another where CPL Kok enters the well involuntarily, and a third option where CPL Kok leaves and does not enter the pump well at all. After CPL Kok was placed near the pump well, he was seen taking off his clothes and personal belongings by himself. This was captured by the CCTV footage.[^100] Based on the evidence and the testimony of the ROTA 3 servicemen, I accepted that out of the three different possible outcomes of the “Kolam” activity that evening, the reasonable expectation of the servicemen was for CPL Kok to have entered the pump well voluntarily.

36     As seen from the CCTV footage,[^101] SSGT Fatwa took matters into his own hands and pushed CPL Kok into the well from behind in a swift and sudden motion. SSGT Fatwa testified under cross-examination that the push happened so suddenly and unexpectedly that the rest of the servicemen were not in a position to have stopped him.[^102] Without consulting or alerting the rest of the servicemen, SSGT Fatwa physically forced CPL Kok into the pump well without his knowledge. In my view, this was a significant departure from the reasonable intention of the rest of the servicemen to allow CPL Kok to enter the well on his own. In the same vein, it could not be said that SSGT Fatwa’s act was consistent with the servicemen’s “sole and ultimate aim” of ensuring that CPL Kok enters the pump well.[^103]

37     The Prosecution raised the point that the servicemen were seen to be laughing or smiling moments after CPL Kok was pushed in before they realised that something extremely tragic had occurred.[^104] When taken together with the celebratory mood that evening, this could show a desire for CPL Kok to enter the well. However, I did not find these spontaneous and momentary gestures by the servicemen to be indicative of an acceptance of the means by which SSGT Fatwa had employed to cause CPL Kok to fall into the well. Many of the ROTA 3 servicemen testified that they did not expect SSGT Fatwa to push CPL Kok into the well.[^105] The Prosecution agreed that the servicemen were not aware that SSGT Fatwa was going to push CPL Kok into the well, and that the push was met with some measure of surprise on the part of some of the servicemen.[^106] As such, the push by SSGT Fatwa could not be attributable to the intention of the rest of the servicemen, nor could it be said that the push was the “mechanism”[^107] by which any such intention was to be achieved.

38     The applicable test for causation is the substantial cause test as stated in the case of _Ng Keng Yong_ at \[66\] and affirmed in _Balakrishnan_ at \[76\]. Under the substantial cause test, criminal liability attaches to the person(s) whose negligence or rashness contributed substantially, and not merely peripherally, to the result. I accepted that the push by SSGT Fatwa alone was the proximate and efficient cause of the grievous hurt suffered by CPL Kok and constituted the primary offence under s 338(_a_) of the Penal Code. Prior to the push, the servicemen were content for CPL Kok to enter the well on his own. Despite their cheering and taunting, they held back on using physical force to effect his entry into well. This must be seen in contrast against the callous attitude and wanton disregard for the safety of CPL Kok’s life when SSGT Fatwa pushed him in from the back.

39     The Prosecution highlighted that for causation to be established, the criminal act in question does not inexorably have to be the most recent act: _Ng Keng Yong_ at \[65\]. While this is true as a matter of legal principle, in the present case there was no credible evidence which pointed to the fact that the group of servicemen would have caused CPL Kok to enter the well in a similar fashion had SSGT Fatwa not been the one to do so. Put in another way, the act of taunting, carrying and egging CPL Kok by the servicemen did not materially contribute to the eventual harm suffered if CPL Kok had entered the pump well on his own. On the facts, it was apparent that the push by SSGT Fatwa had the most significant effect on CPL Kok’s eventual entry into the well. Thus, it was his act alone which was the proximate and efficient cause of the grievous hurt suffered by CPL Kok, and which constitutes the primary offence under s 338(_a_) of the Penal Code.

### Secondary offence – Abetment of the primary offence by illegal omission

40     For the charge against the accused persons to be established, the Prosecution must prove an intention on the part of the abettor to aid in the offence, as well as a knowledge of the circumstances constituting the offence: _Balakrishnan_ at \[64\]. In _Bala Murugan a/l Krishnan and another v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 420</span> at \[28\], the Court of Appeal cited from the editors of _Ratanlal & Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes_ (24th Ed, 1997, Vol 1) in respect of the offence of abetment by intentional aid at p 404:

> “_The intention should be to aid the commission of a crime. A mere giving of an aid will not make the act an abetment of an offence, if the person who gave the aid did not know that an offence was being committed or contemplated._ The intention should be to aid an offence or to facilitate the commission of an offence … Nor is mere proof that the crime charged could not have been committed without the intervention of the abettor, enough compliance with the requirement of section 107. _It is necessary that the intervention should have been made with the intent to facilitate the commission of the crime. Intentional aiding and therefore active complicity is the gist of the offence of abetment under the third paragraph of section 107.”_ (Emphasis in italics)

41     Having found that it was SSGT Fatwa’s act which constitutes the primary offence under s 338(_a_) Penal Code, it was clear that the accused persons could not have had the necessary _mens rea_ for the abetment charge to be made out. To begin with, it was undisputed that there was no concrete plan to carry out any “Kolam” activity on CPL Kok that evening. Following the celebration in the watch room, four of the servicemen had spontaneously started to carry CPL Kok towards the direction of the pump well. They were SSGT Adighazali bin Suhaimi (“**SSGT Adighazali**”), LCP Mohamed Rabik Atham Ansari (“**LCP Ansari**”), SSGT Al-Khudaifi and SSGT Riduan. The four of them had not carried CPL Kok pursuant to any order or command given by the accused persons. Rather, they had acted on their own initiative without any forewarning or prior consultation with their commanders.

42     Following the celebration in the watch room, both LTA Chong and SWO Nazhan had some knowledge that “Kolam” activity that was going on. However, they did not expect SSGT Fatwa would push CPL Kok into the well. There was also no evidence that they knew the servicemen were out to get CPL Kok into the well “by any means”, or that CPL Kok would be physically forced into the well against his wish. The respective portions of the evidence revealed that the accused persons had, at the highest, expected CPL Kok to enter the well voluntarily:

> (a)     LTA Chong testified that when he looked out of the window and saw the servicemen at the pump well, he knew that the servicemen were going to make CPL Kok enter the well as part of the “Kolam” activity. However, if CPL Kok had refused to go in, he did not think any of the ROTA 3 servicemen would force him to go into the well.[^108] LTA Chong similarly stated in a further statement[^109] that he had expected CPL Kok to enter the well on his own. To his understanding, “Kolam” activity was a known type of celebration where the target would be made to go down on their own. CPL Kok was very well-liked, and LTA Chong did not expect the servicemen would push him into the well. Even if CPL Kok did not want to go into the well, LTA Chong did not think that there would be any physical force used on him. LTA Chong has never heard of people being thrown or pushed into the well if they refuse to enter.[^110]

> (b)     For SWO Nazhan, he was trailing behind the group of servicemen when they were carrying CPL Kok towards the pump well. From the CCTV footage,[^111] he was also seen gesturing and pointing at the pump well after CPL Kok was put down. SSGT Fatwa testified that before SWO Nazhan left the vicinity of the pump well, he had told CPL Kok to jump nearer to the edge of the Kolam if he could not swim.[^112] This was not challenged by Mr Retnam in SSGT Fatwa’s cross-examination. By his own evidence, SWO Nazhan could not remember what he had said.[^113] Under cross-examination, he testified that while it was possible for CPL Kok to have been pushed into the well, this possibility was not high.[^114] CPL Kok would most probably enter the well by himself.[^115]

43     Most crucially, at the time when the push occurred, neither of the accused persons were physically present at the pump well. The accused persons did not witness the push by SSGT Fatwa, nor did they have the opportunity to intervene or to take any steps to prevent the primary offence from being committed. The Prosecution argued, on the authority of _Balakrishnan_, that there is no requirement for the abettor to be present at the immediate scene of the crime.[^116] In that case, the High Court agreed with the district judge’s finding that WO Balakrishnan was physically present during the water treatment, or was at least able to witness the water treatment. Yong CJ only held by way of _obiter dicta_ that there is no requirement for the abettor to be present at the immediate scene.

### Conviction on amended charge – Doing an act so negligently as to endanger human life

44     In conclusion, there were inherent difficulties in proving the Primary Offence and Secondary Offence based on the original proceeded charges as framed by the Prosecution. Apart from a general expectation for CPL Kok to enter the pump well, there was no common consensus among the servicemen as to what the “Kolam” activity entailed. There was also no unity of purpose that physical force would be applied to CPL Kok to cause him to enter the well against his will. In addition, the abetment charge would require the accused persons to have the _mens rea_ to abet the group of servicemen _collectively_ when each one of them had a different individual state of mind. On the facts, I found that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the accused persons had the knowledge of the essential circumstances of the Primary Offence.

45     Nonetheless, there was a dereliction of duty on the part of the accused persons, as the commander and deputy commander of ROTA 3, to stop the servicemen who were under their charge from proceeding with the “Kolam” activity. The accused persons were legally obliged, as CPL Kok’s commanders in ROTA 3, to ensure that CPL Kok’s life and safety is not endangered while he was on duty. Both of them owed a duty of care to CPL Kok to keep him safe. The “Kolam” activity carried out by the group of servicemen amounted to ragging which was prohibited by the SCDF. Based on the SCDF’s Discipline Instruction Manual,[^117] ragging activities are defined as any form of action, be it physical or verbal, that causes or is likely to cause bodily harm, injury and/or mental anguish to the target or victim.[^118] Any form of ragging on any SCDF servicemen is prohibited, be it as a welcoming initiation or a farewell ritual for servicemen going to ORD.[^119] The onus fell on both of the accused persons to have prevented the “Kolam” activity from being carried out. On the facts, it was clear that their failure to prevent the "Kolam” activity from being carried out amounted to an illegal omission.

46     The present facts show that carrying out “Kolam” activity was an act which carried the risk of endangering CPL Kok’s life. Dr George Paul, the forensic pathologist, explained that even if CPL Kok had gone into the well by lowering himself into the water, it would be dangerous if he is not used to water rushing into his nose or if he is not used to blowing out air as his head starts to submerge. This is all the more so for a non-swimmer in a confined space such as the pump well.[^120] On the facts, it was clear that the “Kolam” activity conducted by the group of servicemen would endanger the life of CPL Kok due to the risk of drowning. The accused persons ought to have recognised this danger and put a stop before anything untoward could have happened.

47     Based on the foregoing, the court found that there was sufficient evidence that would establish a charge under s 336(_b_) of the Penal Code against each of the accused persons. Accordingly, the court exercised its power under s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) to frame an amended charge against the accused persons. Each of them was charged to have done an act which was so negligent as to endanger human life by failing to prevent a group of servicemen from ROTA 3 from carrying out “Kolam” activity on CPL Kok. The amended charge under s 336(_b_) of the Penal Code was framed as follows:

> “You…**Chong Chee Boon Kenneth**…are charged that you, on 13 May 2018, sometime between 9.00pm and 9.07pm, at 103 Tuas South Avenue 3, Tuas View Fire Station, Singapore, as Commander of ROTA 3 of the said fire station, did an act which was so negligent as to endanger human life, by failing to prevent a group of servicemen from ROTA 3 of the said fire station from carrying out “Kolam” activity on Kok Yuen Chin (male / 22 years old / NRIC No.: XXX), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 336(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

> “You…**Nazhan Bin Mohamed Nazi**…are charged that you, on 13 May 2018, sometime between 9.00pm and 9.07pm, at 103 Tuas South Avenue 3, Tuas View Fire Station, Singapore, as Deputy Commander of ROTA 3 of the said fire station, did an act which was so negligent as to endanger human life, by failing to prevent a group of servicemen from ROTA 3 of the said fire station from carrying out “Kolam” activity on Kok Yuen Chin (male / 22 years old / NRIC No.: XXX), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 336(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

48     Following the amendment of the charge, LTA Chong pleaded guilty and was convicted accordingly. SWO Nazhan pleaded not guilty and did not wish to recall any witnesses for further cross-examination. Mr Retnam proceeded to tender further submissions on the amended charge.[^121] Most of the issues raised in the further submissions were dealt with above, save for one point in relation to the relative seniority between the two ROTA 3 commanders within the leadership hierarchy. Mr Retnam raised this point several times throughout his written further submissions on the amended charge:

> (a)     SWO Nazhan was the deputy commander while the “number one” commander was LTA Chong. CPL Kok’s ORD celebration was initiated by LTA Chong and the celebrations continued after the cake-cutting ceremony and speeches in the watch room. In the watch room, LTA Chong did not say anything despite the mention of “Kolam”. Subsequently when the four servicemen carried CPL Kok, LTA Chong did nothing to stop it.[^122] SWO Nazhan, being second in command, could not “override” the ORD celebration initiated by LTA Chong.

> (b)     When SWO Nazhan left the pump well to go to his office, LTA Chong was “still around”. LTA Chong was present when the second sequences of event started and he had chosen not to stop the celebration. Therefore, the culpability should not be transferred to SWO Nazhan, the second in command, when he was not even there at the pump well.[^123]

> (c)     SWO Nazhan was “subordinate to” LTA Chong who was the number one in command. LTA Chong knew the servicemen were going to make CPL Kok go into the pump well which was officially banned when it was found out about 10 years ago. He opened the window and shouted towards the servicemen “no filming”. LTA Chong has accepted responsibility as the commander.[^124]

49     In my view, the difference in relative seniority does not absolve SWO Nazhan of his duty and legal obligation as a commander to ensure the safety of the servicemen under his charge. The duty and obligation owed by SWO Nazhan arises out of his position as one of the highest-ranking commanders in ROTA 3 on the evening of 13 May 2018. This is regardless of where LTA Chong may have been at the material time when the “Kolam” activity occurred. In fact, there could have been no excuse for SWO Nazhan given that he was himself present with the group of servicemen at the pump well while the “Kolam” activity was taking place.

50     In the present case where the life or safety of a servicemen is concerned, those who are in positions of command ought to bear the responsibility of making the sensible and independent call to stop any dangerous activity instead of having to defer to a higher authority. There was no suggestion that SWO Nazhan required permission or approval from the LTA Chong before he could instruct the servicemen to stop the “Kolam” activity. As the deputy commander, he could have and should have done so on his own authority. However, he failed to do so when he was around at the pump well and effectively allowed the “Kolam” activity to proceed, endangering CPL Kok’s life. In the absence of any further compelling arguments, I found SWO Nazhan guilty and convicted him of the amended charge under s 336(_b_) Penal Code.

## Sentence

51     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 336(_b_) Penal Code is an imprisonment term of up to three months, or a fine of up to $1,500, or both. The Prosecution sought the maximum sentence of three months’ imprisonment for both accused persons, highlighting that the principle of general deterrence featured overwhelmingly in this case.[^125] It was argued that the offence committed in the present case is considered the worst of its kind because of the degree of negligence exhibited.[^126] According to the Prosecution, the omission took place over a sustained period[^127] and ultimately led to the death of CPL Kok.[^128]

52     As a starting point, the dominant sentencing principle is one of general deterrence. There is significant public interest in deterring ragging activities within the SCDF. Public confidence must not be eroded by a permissive stance taken by commanders towards the safety of the servicemen under their charge. This is especially the case when the lives of these servicemen are entrusted to them during national service. A strong stance must be taken to ensure that the safety of these servicemen remains paramount.

53     The offence here is one under the “endangering life” limb of s 336(_b_) Penal Code, which is the more serious limb as opposed to the “personal safety” limb. The harm that resulted from the negligence of the accused persons, the death of CPL Kok, is the worst outcome that could have resulted from the negligence captured by the “endangering life” limb of the provision. In _Hue An Li_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span>, the High Court held at \[71\] that the outcome materiality principle trumps the control principle in the context of criminal negligence. Accordingly, the sentence imposed should fall within the higher end of the spectrum in order to reflect the gravity of the consequence of negligence.

54     The maximum punishment for an offence ought to be imposed only when the crime belongs to the most serious category of cases under that offence: _PP v Firdaus bin Abdullah_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 225</span> (“_Firdaus_”) at \[17\]. While death is generally the most serious consequence of any offence, that alone would not _ipso facto_ attract the maximum sentence. All other relevant factors such as the manner in which the death was caused, the relationship between the offender and the victim, the offender’s state of mind or the offender’s motives would go towards weighing whether the particular crime fell within the worst category of cases for the offence in question: _Firdaus_ at \[18\]. In other words, even though the extent of harm is indicative of the sentence to be meted out, it is merely one of many factors to be considered in determining the appropriate sentence.

55     On the facts, the accused persons were grossly negligent in allowing the “Kolam” activity to proceed even though they did not know that CPL Kok could not swim. Although LTA Chong knew that the servicemen were engaging in the “Kolam” activity, he shouted “no filming” which would have given the signal for the servicemen to continue with the “Kolam” activity. For SWO Nazhan, though he was physically near the servicemen and was present at the pump well, he similarly did not put a stop to the “Kolam” activity. As the highest-ranking officers on duty in ROTA 3 at the material time of the incident, CPL Kok would have looked to the both of them as his commanders to ensure his safety. The failure by the accused persons reflected a blatant form of negligence as commanders of the SCDF as there was ample opportunity to have stopped the “Kolam” activity.

56     As for the circumstances in which the offence was committed, the “Kolam” activity took place spontaneously and the entire incident lasted within a matter of minutes. The majority of the servicemen were prepared to give CPL Kok the chance to decide if he wanted to enter the well and how he wanted to enter the well. During this period, the accused persons had likely expected CPL Kok to enter the pump well voluntarily. While none of these would have excused the negligence of the commanders, their culpability should be seen in the light of the sudden and unexpected push by SSGT Fatwa on CPL Kok that had caused the tragic loss of CPL Kok’s life. Taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the degree of negligence involved, serious as it may be, do not represent the most egregious type of cases for which the maximum sentence of three months’ imprisonment ought to be imposed.

57     There were no significant mitigating factors that would apply to the accused persons. Where the public interest element features strongly in favour of a need for deterrence, the sentencing discount for pleading guilty would be limited. Furthermore, a plea of guilty would be of no mitigating value when the evidence overwhelmingly supports a conviction: _Fu Foo Tong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 1</span> at \[12\]. Therefore, even though LTA Chong had pleaded guilty to the amended charge, I did not think that reason alone justified a sentencing discount. As between LTA Chong and SWO Nazhan, their respective culpability did not vary so significantly as to warrant a difference in sentence.

58     Based on the foregoing, having considered the submissions and all the relevant factors and circumstances of the case, I was of the view that a sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment for both LTA Chong and SWO Nazhan would be fair and appropriate. The sentences imposed fell within the high end of the sentencing spectrum, and this would be necessary to send the message that those who are entrusted with the lives of servicemen ought to abide by the rules and display the highest level of duty of care.
