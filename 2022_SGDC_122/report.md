4       I sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years’ and 9 months’ imprisonment.

5       The accused has filed an appeal against both his conviction on the charges that he claimed trial to, and the sentences imposed.

## Facts

### The Prosecution’s case

6       The Prosecution called a total of 13 witnesses.

7       In relation to the consumption charge, the following witnesses gave evidence as to the events commencing from the arrest of the accused, the procurement of his urine sample, and the testing of the urine sample:

> (a)     PW1, the arresting officer, who arrested the accused on 30 June 2020. The First Information Report recording this arrest (P1) was lodged at 7.22pm on 30 June 2020. He observed that the accused “_was slurred in speech and seemed to have an unsteady gait_”[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) at the point of his arrest. Upon his arrest, the accused was brought to the lock-up at the Central Police Division, where he was searched and various items were found on him, including tobacco-like substances.

> (b)     PW2, the urine procurement officer, who oversaw the procurement of the accused’s urine samples on at about 1.40am on 1 July 2020. According to PW2, the accused was brought from the temporary holding area to the cluster area where he was stationed on duty. PW2 provided a detailed account of how the procurement process was carried out, which he testified was done in accordance with the practices of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) and that there was nothing unusual about the urine procurement process involving the accused.

> (c)     PW3, the sealing officer and officer who conducted the instant urine test (“IUT”). He testified that he and another officer escorted the accused from the lock-up to the CNB Central Division office, where the IUT was conducted at about 2.02am on 1 July 2020, and when the IUT result returned positive, he proceeded to seal and label the urine samples and placed them in a metal container for onward transport to the Health Science Authority (“HSA”)

> (d)     PW4, the dispatch officer, who transported the metal container with the accused’s urine samples to HSA and observed as the HSA counter staff retrieved the samples.

> (e)     PW5 and PW6, analysts from the HSA Analytical Toxicology Laboratory, Drug Abuse Testing Unit, who conducted the analysis on the accused’s urine samples and found them to contain morphine. They each issued a certificate stating this finding (P3 and P4). They also explained to the court that the consumption of tramadol, regardless of the mode of administration, would not give rise to morphine in the urine.

> (f)     PW12, the investigation officer in charge of the case. She testified that the accused had informed her during investigations that he had been admitted to two different hospitals, and that she then verified with the hospitals that they did not have any records of the accused having been admitted as a patient.

8       Relying on the presumption relating to urine tests as provided under Section 22 of the MDA, the Prosecution’s case was that given that both tests conducted on the accused’s urine samples showed that morphine was found in his urine, the accused is presumed to have consumed morphine, unless the accused’s proved otherwise.

9       As for the charges relating to the failure to report for urine testing, the following witnesses gave evidence as to the service of the supervision order on the accused, as well as the accused’s failure to report for testing as required by the order:

> (a)     PW7, a urine supervision officer, who had lodged the police report (P5) regarding the accused’s failure to report for urine testing. PW7 testified that the accused had failed to report for any of the routine urine tests that he was required to attend from 20 February 2020 onwards, and that they had not been contacted by the accused nor given any valid reason for his absence.

> (b)     PW8, a CNB officer who served a supervision order (P8) and urine notice (P9) on the accused on 13 February 2020 while the accused was in prison, which required him to report at Bedok Police Division every Monday and Thursday with effect from 20 February 2020. PW8 testified that the accused refused to sign his acknowledgment of receipt of the order, which she duly recorded on P8 along with the reasons he had provided for his refusal to sign, including the fact that he was stateless. PW8 said she informed the accused that she was not able to check on his records on the spot, but that he should in any event report to Bedok Division as per the order and explain his situation to the officer there.

> (c)     PW9 and PW10 were the CNB officers who were on duty at the reporting centre at Bedok Police Division on 8, 11 and 29 June 2020. They both confirmed that the accused did not report to the centre on these dates, and that the accused had not contacted them regarding his absence.

10     The Prosecution’s case was that the supervision order had been validly issued to the accused and having failed to report for the urine testing as required by the order, including on the three dates that are the subject matter of the charges, he had committed the offences of failing to report for urine testing.

### Close of the Prosecution’s case

11     The Defence did not make any submission of no case to answer at the close of the Prosecution’s case. Having the heard the evidence led by the Prosecution, I was satisfied that a _prima facie_ case had been made out on each of the four charges and accordingly I called upon the accused to enter his defence.

### The Defence’s case

12     The accused was the sole witness for the Defence.

13     At the start of the trial, the accused raised an objection to the charge for the consumption of morphine, on the basis that as a non-Singaporean, he should not be liable for enhanced punishment for the consumption of specified drugs under Section 33A(2) of the MDA, or what is commonly referred to as an “LT-2” charge.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

14     The Prosecution responded that under the relevant provisions of the MDA, as long as such an offence is alleged to have been committed within Singapore and where the antecedent requirements had been met, then a person would be liable to be charged and tried for the offence. I agreed with the Prosecution’s position and saw no issue with the legality of the consumption charge against the accused. The accused did not pursue this line of argument any further.

15     For the remainder of the trial, the accused’s defence centred on the following assertions:

> (a)     The morphine in his urine test was the result of his consumption of tramadol, which he said was administered to him by medical staff at either Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) or Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”).

> (b)     The urine samples that had been collected from him and placed outside the holding cell before he was escorted to the CNB office had been taken away by officers, and therefore they had been taken out of his sight for a period. He claimed he did not know what happened to the samples in this period. Under cross-examination, the accused claimed that the persons who had taken away his urine samples had in fact appeared earlier in the trial as Prosecution witnesses, though he had not identified them to the court at any point before this.

> (c)     As a stateless person, he had not been subjected to urine reporting requirements previously and did not see why they should have applied to him in this instance.

> (d)     PW8 had told him that she would return to her office to check with her supervisor as to whether he was required to report for urine testing in light of the issues that he had raised with her on 13 February 2020, and that she would return to prisons to provide him with an update. He claimed that she told him that if she did not return, then he would not be required to report for urine testing.

> (e)     Upon his release from prison, he was not issued with a urine reporting card, which he understood to mean that he was not required to report for urine testing.

### Prosecution’s rebuttal

16     At the close of the Defence’s case, the Prosecution applied to recall three of its witnesses who had testified earlier in the trial, and to call one additional witness pursuant to Section 230(1)(t) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

17     I noted that in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Bridges Christopher_ \[1007\] 3 SLR(R) 467, the threshold for allowing rebuttal evidence was set as follows (at 51\]):

> “… \[the calling of rebuttal evidence\] will be allowed only in the case of a matter arising _ex improviso_, _ie_ one which the plaintiff could not reasonably have foreseen. In other words where the plaintiff has been misled or taken by surprise or in answer to evidence of the defendant in support of an issue the proof of which lay upon the defendant.”

18     The accused did not raise any objections to the recalling and calling of these witnesses. After considering the Prosecution’s applications and the reasons provided, I allowed the applications.

19     In relation to PW2 and PW3, learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) explained that while the accused had posed questions to these witnesses about his urine samples having been taken away during cross-examination, it was only during the accused’s own testimony – under cross-examination – that he first claimed that the persons who had removed his urine samples had in fact testified in court earlier during the trial. This was a point that had not emerged earlier when PW2 and PW3 were on the stand.

20     I agreed with the Prosecution that the threshold for recalling PW2 and PW3 as rebuttal witnesses had been met, as the assertion that the persons who had taken the urine samples were among the Prosecution’s witnesses did not emerge in the evidence till after the Prosecution had rested its case.

21     Both PW2 and PW3 were asked to address the question of whether they had taken away the accused’s urine samples from him while he was in the lock-up, to which both PW2 and PW3 denied doing so. PW3 also testified that when he arrived to escort the accused from the lock-up, the accused had been holding his urine sample.

22     The Prosecution next sought to recall PW12, the investigation officer, for the purposes of rebutting the accused’s claims that he had received treatment at either TTSH or SGH sometime before either one of his arrests, which was in June and August 2020. I noted that the issue of hospital treatments had already been dealt with in PW12’s initial testimony, and to this the learned DPP indicated that the accused had previously not provided the specific time frame of his admissions to the hospitals, and that this was new information that had arisen only in the accused’s testimony in court.

23     I allowed the application to recall PW12 on the basis provided by the Prosecution, and PW12 provided straightforward evidence that she had made enquiries with the two hospitals covering the specific time periods that the accused had mentioned, and that both hospitals had responded to say that they had no records of the accused whether as an in-patient or an out-patient during this time frame.

24     The final witness that the Prosecution sought to introduce in rebuttal was PW13, a senior personnel care officer at Tembusu Home Pelangi Village, the welfare home that the accused was residing in at that time. I allowed the Prosecution’s application to call PW13 to address a claim by the accused in his evidence that he had been issued a medical certificate by TTSH, which he handed to one ‘Mr Saravanan’ from the Tembusu Home Pelangi Village, who then called to inform the police about the medical certificate and to ask whether the accused was still required to attend his urine test, to which the supposed response from the police had been “_it is up to him_”[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

25     PW13 denied having received any such medical certificate from the accused and said that he was not even aware that the accused was required to report for urine testing. Had he been aware of this, he said he would have facilitated the accused’s attendance for the reporting.

## Joinder of charges

26     In proceeding on a joint trial of the consumption charge and the three charges for failing to report for urine testing, the Prosecution indicated that they were relying on Section 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code as the basis for joining the charges in a single trial. The learned DPP argued that given that the charges occurred within a short frame of time, namely all within the month of June 2020. Given the proximity of time of the offences, he argued that they ought to be considered part of the same transaction such that the accused maybe tried at a single trial for these offences.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) This justification was provided belatedly on the second day of the trial. When this was explained to the accused, he confirmed that he did not have any issue with the proceeded charges being tried in a single trial.[^5]

27     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission, and I was of the view that there was indeed sufficient proximity of time and purpose in the proceeded charges. While the consumption charge and the failure to report for urine testing did not technically involve the same legally protected interest, there was a connectedness in the offences in that they alleged that the accused had failed to report for urine testing and in his absence from urine testing he was indeed found to have consumed drugs, the very thing the urine tests were intended to deter and detect. All this occurred within a short frame of time, with the last of the urine test dates being just a day before he was arrested and was alleged to have consumed drugs. In my view, it was appropriate for the proceeded charges to be tried in a single trial and that the accused had not been prejudiced in his defence because of the joinder of the charges.

## Analysis of the evidence

### The consumption charge

28     In order to establish the charge for the consumption offence under Section 8(b)(ii) punishable under Section 33A(2) of the MDA, the Prosecution would have to prove the following elements beyond reasonable doubt:

> (a)     That the accused did consume a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA, namely, morphine;

> (b)     The accused was not authorised to consume morphine under MDA or the Regulations made under the MDA; and

> (c)     The accused had previously been convicted under Section 33A(1) of the MDA.

29     The elements (b) and (c) above were not in dispute. PW12, the investigation officer, testified that the accused was not authorised to consume morphine, whether under the MDA or the Regulations under the MDA, and the accused similarly confirmed this under cross-examination.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) The memorandum of previous convictions (P11) showed that the accused was previously convicted for an offence of consuming a Specified Drug, namely morphine, under Section 8(b)(ii) punishable under Section 33A(1) of the MDA, on 19 July 2002, for which he was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

30     As for the main element of the charge, the consumption of morphine, the Prosecution sought to rely on the presumption at Section 22 of the MDA, which provides that “_\[i\]f any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b)_.”

31     To rely on this presumption, the Prosecution would first have to prove that morphine, a controlled drug, was found in the accused’s urine as a result of both urine tests conducted under Section 31(4)(b) of the MDA.

#### Chain of custody of the urine specimens

32     One of the key issues raised by the accused concerned the chain of custody of the urine samples.

33     The Prosecution’s case in relation to the chain of custody can be broken down into the following main stages: (i) the procurement of the urine specimens from the accused, (ii) the preliminary testing and sealing of the urine specimens, and (iii) the collection and delivery of the specimens to HSA for analysis.

34     The accused did not take any issue with the evidence of PW4, who handled the collection and delivery of the specimens to the HSA for analysis. His challenges related to the procurement of the urine specimens and the period just before the IUT was conducted on his urine.

35     The first allegation raised concerned the steps taken during the urine procurement process, which was overseen by PW2. In his cross-examination of PW2, the accused claimed that “_\[t\]he urine pouring, all this was done by the CNB officer. It was not done by me or---or---or by the uniformed staff. It was done by the CNB officer himself. He is the one who took the urine sample_.”[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) In re-examination, the PW2 maintained that the pouring of the urine samples had been done by the accused himself.[^8]

36     I saw no reason to disbelieve PW2’s position, who I found to be a credible witness. As I have noted at \[37\] and \[41\] below, he was a candid witness who did not shy away from stating if he could not recall or did not know certain things. In any event, the issue of who had poured the urine was, to my mind, not of significance, since according to paragraph 5(1) of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations, the transferring of the urine specimen from the master bottle to the two containers can be done either by the enforcement officer or the suspect, in the presence of both. Even by the accused’s account, this requirement had clearly been complied with.

37     More importantly, based on PW2’s testimony as to the steps that were taken during the urine procurement process, I noted that what he had described was in line with the procedure for the procurement of urine specimens as set out in the First Schedule of the Regulations. PW2 rather candidly admitted that he could not specifically recall asking the accused to wash and dry his hands[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) in accordance with paragraph 1 of the First Schedule – a point that the accused did not raise any issue with – though he confirmed that he had carried out the procurement procedure in accordance with CNB’s practices.[^10] On the evidence, I was satisfied that the prescribed procedure had been complied with.

38     The second and potentially more consequential allegation that the accused raised was that the urine samples, specifically the red master bottle, had been taken out of his sight while he was in the lock-up by two uniformed officers.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) In his cross-examination of PW2 and PW3, the details of this allegation remained rather bare, with further details emerging while he was under cross-examination by the Prosecution. At that stage, he added that he had seen other bottles placed outside the lock-up cell that belonged to other accused persons[^12], and that the two uniformed officers who had taken his urine sample were both Malay officers – one staff sergeant and one sergeant – and that one of them had been in court earlier as a Prosecution witness[^13]. The implication, therefore, was that the urine sample that was eventually tested may not have been his.

39     Having considered the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the chain of custody was unbroken, and the accused had not sufficiently cast reasonable doubt on this issue, for the following reasons.

40     First, the Prosecution’s case as to the chain of custody was comprehensive and clear. The procurement of the samples, preliminary testing and the sealing of the bottles were carried out in accordance with the prescribed procedures, and the evidence of PW2 and PW3 was able to trace how the specimens made their way to the CNB office.

41     On this issue, PW2’s evidence was that after the urine samples had been procured from the accused and the urine poured from the red master bottle into the two blue bottles, they were placed into tamper-proof polymer bags that were had the accused’s name and identification number handwritten on them, which he said that the accused had verified and confirmed were correct. According to PW2, the bagged samples were placed outside the lock-up cell that the accused was in where it would have been visible to him through a glass panel.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) PW2 maintained that he did not take the urine samples away from the accused[^15], though he also reasonably conceded that he would not be able to say if anyone else had taken the samples after the accused had been escorted away from the lock-up area.[^16]

42     Crucially, PW3, who escorted the accused from the lock-up area, confirmed that when he arrived to escort the accused from the lock-up the bagged urine samples were in the accused’s possession.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) This directly contradicted the accused’s claim that the urine samples had been taken away from him and taken to an unknown place. PW3 also confirmed that he did not take the samples away from the accused.[^18]

43     Second, the accused’s claims of the urine samples having been taken away from his sight were internally inconsistent with his own evidence, and there were several indications that this defence was an afterthought:

> (a)     The possibility of a urine sample having been tampered with is a serious matter, which would invariably be central to the accused’s defence to the charge, yet no mention of this was made of this during investigations as evident in the statements that were recorded from him, P7 and P12. In P12, the accused made mention of the claim that he had been given tramadol, but not that the urine samples had been tampered with.

> (b)     The accused agreed that this was not the first urine test that he had undergone.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) The significance of the urine samples having been taken away from him would not have been lost on him, yet there is no evidence that he put up any protest during the any of the stages, including when he was at the lock-up, while he was being escorted out of the lock-up, and while he was at the CNB office.

> (c)     The way the allegation was made in court, having claimed that the person who had taken his urine samples away while he was at the lock-up had in fact testified as a witness earlier during the trial only when he was being cross-examined, and not when the Prosecution witnesses were on the stand, again suggested that this was merely an afterthought.

> (d)     By the accused’s own admission, after he had given his urine sample, he had gone to sleep[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20), which begs the question how he could have seen what had been done to the urine samples if he was not even awake.

44     Taken together, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the urine samples that was tested by HSA were the urine samples that the accused had provided.

45     Accordingly, I was satisfied that the presumption under Section 22 of the MDA had been engaged, such that in light of the test results of the analysis by the two HSA officers indicating that morphine was found in the urine samples of the accused, that he was presumed to have consumed to have consumed morphine, unless the accused proved otherwise.

#### The medication defence

46     In this regard, the accused’s primary defence was that he had been administered with tramadol at either TTSH or SGH just prior to his arrest, and that the tramadol gave rise to the morphine in his urine. I rejected this defence entirely.

47     The two HSA analysts who ran the analysis on the accused’s urine samples, PW5 and PW6, each testified that consumption of tramadol, regardless the mode of administration, does not give rise to morphine in the urine.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) They explained that tramadol’s molecular structure is different from that of morphine, and the metabolic pathway for tramadol does not give rise to morphine.[^22] The accused did not seek to challenge the evidence of the HSA analysts and did not proffer any evidence in support of his assertion apart from claiming that he had read on Google that it is possible for tramadol to give rise to morphine.[^23]

48     Further, the investigating officer PW12 had also testified that her investigations revealed that the accused had not been admitted as a patient at either TTSH or SGH for the period of January to August 2020. This covered the entire period that the accused could possibly have been admitted to the hospitals for treatment, as he so claimed.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

49     Accordingly, I found that the presumption under Section 22 of the MDA remained unrebutted by the Defence and the Prosecution had therefore proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had consumed morphine on or before 30 June 2020.

### The failure to report for urine testing

50     As for the three charges relating to the accused’s failure to report for urine testing, for these to be established the Prosecution would have to prove the following elements:

> (a)     That the accused was a person subjected to a Supervision Order for a period of 24 months with effect from 17th February 2020 issued under Regulation 15(2) of the MDR; and

> (b)     The accused failed to present himself to the duty officer at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for a urine test as required under the said Order on 8, 11 and 29 June 2020.

51     It was undisputed that the accused did not present himself to the duty officer at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters on the three dates in question. It was also undisputed that PW8 had met with the accused on 13 February 2020 before his release from prison for the purpose of issuing to him a supervision order (P8) and a notice under Regulation 15(3)(f) requiring him to undergo urine tests during the period of supervision (P9).

52     In his defence, the accused raised several issues that aimed to suggest that there had not been a valid supervision order in force that required the accused to present himself for the urine tests on the dates in question.

53     First, the accused had refused to sign his acknowledgement on the supervision order (P8) that PW8 served on him. The reasons for his refusal were that he was a stateless person and who had never been subject to routine urine testing before. From my reading of the relevant provisions of the MDA and the MDR, I could find nothing that suggested that a non-Singaporean or a stateless person could not be subjected to a supervision order under Regulation 15 of the MDR. Regulation 15(2) only limits the persons who may be issued with a supervision order to those who have been discharged from an approved institute, or who has been convicted of an offence under Section 8(b), 31(2) or (2A) or 31A(2) or (2A) of the MDA. The accused had previously been convicted of offences under Section 8(b) of the MDA and was therefore a person whom a supervision order could be made against.

54     As for the fact that the accused refused to and did not sign his acknowledgement on the supervision order, I could not see how this invalidated the supervision order. The supervision order, P8, is a direction from the Deputy Director of the CNB for the accused to be placed under supervision, while the notice under Regulation 15(3)(f), P9, is framed as a notice of a requirement. The section where the accused was supposed to append his signature on both these documents is titled the “Acknowledgment of Order”, where he was to have confirmed receiving the order and that the contents of the order had been fully explained to him. There is nothing on the face of either the supervision order of the urine notice, or in the MDR that suggested that the accused’s signature of acknowledgement is required in order for the supervision order or the urine notice to be validated. In other words, the supervision order was in effect regardless of whether the accused signed his acknowledgment or not.

55     Second, the accused said that he was not issued with a urine reporting card upon his release from prison, and accordingly this meant that he could not report for urine testing. There was indeed no evidence before the court that the accused had been issued with a urine reporting card.

56     For the same reasons as I have set out above in relation to the accused’s refusal to sign the supervision order, I could see nothing on the face of P8 or P9 that indicated that a urine reporting card had to be issued in order for a supervision order or the urine notice to be valid and in force. Similarly, no such requirement was in the MDR.

57     Third, the accused claimed in court that after he had given his reasons for refusing to sign the supervision order, PW8 had told him that she would return to the office to check with her supervisor if the accused was required to report for urine testing, and that if she did not return to prison to inform him that he was required to do so, then he would not have to do so. As PW8 did not return to prison, he claims that he assumed that he did not need to report for urine testing.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

58     In response to this, PW8 had confirmed that she did indeed indicate that she would return to her office to check on the issues that the accused had raised.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) She testified that she did not remember telling the accused that he was not supposed to report, and that she “_specifically remembered_” that she told the accused that he should in any event report to the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters as required in the order and let the duty officer know of the issues that he had.[^27] The accused never reported to the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters.

59     On the evidence, I was satisfied that not only was there a valid supervision order and urine notice in force against the accused that required him to report for urine testing on the dates stated in the charges, but that the accused understood that he was required to present himself at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for this purpose.

60     The alternative defence that the accused ran was that he had obtained a medical certificate after attending at TTSH, and that a staff at the Pelangi Village assisted him in calling the police to inform them of the medical certificate. He claimed that the staff told him that the police had indicated that it would be up to him to decide if he wished to report for the urine testing.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) The Pelangi Village staff, PW13, denied ever receiving a medical certificate from the accused and testified that he did not even know that the accused was under a supervision order.[^29]

61     On the accused’s own account, if he had indeed tried to present a medical certificate to excuse himself from reporting for urine testing, the only reason why he would do so was if he knew that he was required to report for urine testing in the first place. If he had indeed been under the impression that he did not need to report for urine testing, there would be no need to go through the trouble of having PW13 call the police to check if he was required to go for urine testing. In this regard, the accused’s defence was internally inconsistent.

62     In fact, the true reason for the accused’s absence from the urine testing sessions was likely what he had told PW8 on the 13 February 2020, and in his statement recorded on 14 September 2020 (P7), the voluntariness and accuracy of which was not disputed by the accused. In essence, the accused did not think he ought to be subjected to supervision and urine testing and accordingly he simply refused to turn up. As he put it in P7, “_\[e\]ver since the first ever time I was convicted for drug offences until now, I was never asked to go for urine test supervision. So, I felt that I am not going to report for urine tests and therefore, I refused to sign the CNB orders_”.

63     On the evidence, I was satisfied that the accused was properly required to do so pursuant to the supervision order that was issued to him and having failed to report for urine testing as he was required to do so on the three dates in question, he had committed the offences of failing to report for urine testing.

## Decision on the charges

64     Having considered the evidence before me and for the reasons I have set out above, I was satisfied that the Prosecution proved the elements of the four charges beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the accused on all four charges.

## The stood down charges

65     Upon the accused’s conviction on the four charges after the trial, the Prosecution made a plea offer to the accused, to proceed on two of the four remaining charges that had been stood down, and to have the remaining two charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing:

66     The accused accepted the offer and pleaded guilty to the proceeded charges and gave his consent for the remaining charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

### Facts of the stood down charges

#### Failing to return to welfare home

67     The accused was at the material times admitted to Tembusu Home Pelangi Village, a welfare home under the Destitute Persons Act pursuant to an order made under section 3(4) of the same Act.

68     On 26 June 2020, the accused had the permission of the superintendent of the welfare home to leave the welfare home for a limited time, for the specific purpose of attending a medical appointment at SGH. At about 3pm on the same day, the accused was escorted by a nurse from the welfare home to the SGH for the said medical appointment, via taxi.

69     The taxi arrived at SGH at about 3.20pm, and while the taxi fare was being paid, the accused opened the taxi door despite being warned by the nurse not to do so. The accused then exited the taxi and quickly crossed the road and boarded another taxi. The witness was not able to give chase as there were many cars passing by.

70     The accused defaulted on his appointment at SGH, and subsequently failed to return when the time for him to attend the medical appointment had expired. By the time he was arrested by the police on 30 June 2020 at about 7.30pm, he had been outside the lawful custody of the welfare for a period of 4 days, 4 hours and 20 minutes.

#### Possession of a controlled drug

71     When he was arrested on 30 June 2020, the accused was observed by the arresting officer to be of an unsteady gait and that his speech was slurred. A search was conducted, and the following items were found in the accused’s possession: (i) two red paper packing containing vegetable matter, and (ii) one packet containing vegetable matter.

72     Analysis of the vegetable matter that was seized conducted by the HSA revealed that the packets contained a total of 14.24 grams of fragmented vegetable matter, which was analysed and found to contain MDMB-4en-PINACA, which is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

73     The accused admitted to ownership of the three packets that were found in his possession during the search. He was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess controlled drugs.

## Antecedents

74     The accused has a lengthy criminal history that commenced in 1989. His most recent set of convictions prior to the present case was in 2014, which included multiple counts of the offence under Section 8(b) punishable under Section 33A(2) of the MDA for the consumption of various specified drugs, including morphine. He was sentenced to a total of 9 years imprisonment on this occasion.

## Sentencing

75     The Prosecution sought the following sentences against the accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="22.26%"><col width="38.88%"><col width="38.86%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence section</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Proposed sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-916902-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 8(b)(ii) punishable under Section 33A(2) of the MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 to 8.5 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-902335-2021</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Reg 15(3)(f) read with Reg 15(6)(a) of the MDR</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 to 8 months’ imprisonment per charge</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-902336-2021</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-902337-2021</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-902334-2021</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 8(a) punishable under Section 33(1) of the MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 years 3 months to 2 years 6 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-909061-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 16(c) Destitute Persons Act, Cap 78</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 to 3 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

76     The Prosecution submitted that four of these sentences ought to be ordered to run consecutively

77     The accused declined to say anything in mitigation.

### Reasons for the sentences imposed

#### The consumption charge

78     For the consumption charge, Section 33A(2) of the MDA mandated a minimum imprisonment term of at least 7 years. In seeking 8 to 8.5 years’ imprisonment, the Prosecution noted that this is not the first time the accused has been convicted of a consumption offence that attracted punishment under Section 33A(2) of the MDA, having previously already been punished under Section 33A(2) of the MDA in 2014, for which he received the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment. Further, the accused had elected to claim trial to this charge, and accordingly should not be entitled to any discount that might usually apply for a plea of guilt.

79     In light of the factors highlighted by the Prosecution, I agreed that an uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment was warranted and imposed a sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment on this charge.

80     Section 33A(2) of the MDA also provides that offender convicted under this provision is to be punished with between 6 to 12 strokes of the cane. As the accused was above the age of 50 years, he could not be sentenced to caning pursuant to Section 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Prosecution confirmed that they were not seeking any imprisonment term in lieu of the caning, and I did not impose any additional imprisonment term in this regard.

#### Failing to report for urine testing charges

81     The prescribed punishment for the offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) read with Regulation 15(6)(a) of the MDR is imprisonment for a term of up to 4 years, or a fine of up to $10,000, or both.

82     In submitting for a sentence of between 6 to 8 months’ imprisonment on each of the three charges, the Prosecution referred to the High Court’s decision in _Jassic s/o Kumar Steven_ (MA 9065/2015) where it was observed that the usual tariff for such offences, where the offender had drug-related antecedents, was between 4 to 6 months’ imprisonment.

83     I noted that the Prosecution’s submission was in line with the usual sentences imposed for such offences and imposed a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment on each of the three charges.

#### Possession of controlled drug

84     For the offence of possessing a controlled drug, given that the accused had previously been convicted of an offence under Section 8(a) of the MDA, he was therefore liable to enhanced punishment under Section 33(1) of the MDA, for which the mandatory minimum imprisonment term is 2 years.

85     The accused had already been convicted and sentenced for possession of a controlled drug under Section 8(a) punishable under Section 33(1) in 2014, for which he was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment. As such, the Prosecution argued that an uplift from that previous sentence was appropriate.

86     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission and sentenced the accused to 2 years and 3 months’ imprisonment on this charge.

#### Failure to return to welfare home

87     The offence of failing to return the welfare home under Section 16(c) of the Destitute Persons Act is an offence punishable with imprisonment of up to 6 months.

88     In submitting for a sentence of 2 to 3 weeks’ imprisonment, the Prosecution cited the case of _Public Prosecutor v Ananthan s/o Mutair Chelliaya_ \[2020\] where the offender was sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment for a charge under Section 16(b) of the same Act, which is for leaving a welfare home without permission, and which is similarly punishable with imprisonment of up to 6 months.

89     Given that the essence of the offences under Section 16(b) and 16(c) are similar, I agreed that the sentence imposed in _Ananthan s/o Mutair Chelliaya_ could be used as a reference point and imposed a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment for this charge.

#### Consecutive sentences

90     In asking the court to order four of the sentences to run consecutively, the Prosecution highlighted the fact that the accused faced numerous drug charges, four of which carried mandatory minimum sentences, and that the accused had a history of drug-related offending including his last set of convictions for which he was sentenced to a global sentence of 9 years’ imprisonment.

91     The drug-related offences that the accused faced in this case were all committed in a rather short frame of time, within the month of June 2020, and in essence they were a manifestation of the long-standing drug problem of the accused and his inability (or lack of will) to kick the habit. He refused to submit himself to the urine testing regime, wilfully escaped from the welfare home and went on to get hold of drugs that he then consumed. In that sense, there was a degree of proximity of time and purpose to the offences.

92     As the High Court in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> noted at \[40\], “_\[t\]he question whether the offences are part of a single transaction is an important one and it arises with particular frequency in drug offences which lend themselves very easily to a multiplicity of charges being brought: for consumption, possession, importation and even trafficking_”, though it also noted that the imposition of consecutive sentences may also be appropriate in situations where a subsequent offence reflects increased culpability on the accused’s part even where they may technically form part of the same transaction (see \[42\]).

93     In my view, it was appropriate to run more than the two sentences that I was obliged to run consecutively in this case pursuant to Section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, as a reflection of the level of culpability of the accused. The accused is a persistent drug offender with a long history of similar antecedents, and in this particular series of offending, he did not only seek to continue with his drug problem but also showed disregard for authority and the mechanisms in place to help him to stay free from drugs.

94     Further, given that the global sentence that was imposed on him at his last set of convictions was already 9 years’ imprisonment, I was of the view that some uplift in the current global sentence was appropriate in this case. Accordingly, I ordered the sentences on the consumption charge, one failure to report for urine testing charge, and the possession charge to run consecutively, for a total sentence of 10 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.

95     As the accused had been in remand since 20 August 2020 when he was arrested, I ordered that the sentence be backdated to the date of his arrest.

## Conclusion

96     The Accused is currently serving his sentence.
