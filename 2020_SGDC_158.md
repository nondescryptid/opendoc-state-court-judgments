### District Judge Toh Han Li:

## Introduction

1       The accused is a 35-year-old male and was a practising medical doctor at the time of the offences. The victim is a 27-year-old female. The accused and the victim were in a romantic relationship at the material time.

2       The accused had claimed trial to one count of causing grievous hurt to the victim under section 325 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the VCGH charge”) and one count of wrongful confinement of the same victim under section 342 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the wrongful confinement charge”) (“the 1st and 2nd charges”). During the trial, three charges of causing hurt to the victim under s 323 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the VCH charges”) (“3rd, 4th and 5th charges”) were stood down.

3       At the end of a trial, I convicted him on the VCGH charge and the wrongful confinement charge. He subsequently pleaded guilty to two VCH charges (the 3rd and 5th charge) that were previously stood down with one VCH charge (the 4th charge) taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC charge”). He was sentenced for the 1st , 2nd, 3rd and 5th charges as follows:

4       I ordered the sentences for the VCGH charge and 5th VCH charge to run consecutively leading to a global sentence of 3 years, 6 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment, 4 strokes of the cane and a $4,000 fine, in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment.

5       The accused has not appealed against his conviction for the VCGH charge and wrongful confinement charge. He has only appealed against the sentences imposed.

## Facts relating to the 3rd and 5th VCH charges

6       The accused and the victim first become acquainted with each other through the online dating application “Coffee Meets Bagel” sometime in February 2017, whereupon they exchanged numbers and began dating in the same month.

7       On 1 April 2017 at 10.17 pm, the victim lodged a police report at the Bishan Neighbourhood Police Centre, in respect of two incidents of assault on her by the accused, who was her boyfriend at the time, on 12 March 2017 and 30 March 2017. The victim also reported that the accused had on 17 March 2017 sent her a text message containing a nude photograph of her, and informing her that she would be an internet sensation.

8       The victim stated that she decided to lodge a police report against the accused to ensure her safety, because as she had received a call from the accused earlier that afternoon at about 4 pm wherein he threatened to harm her.

### The 3rd VCH charge

9       On the afternoon of 12 March 2017, the victim met the accused at his flat. The accused was drunk, happy and tipsy and the pair went out to purchase something. Upon returning to the accused’s flat, the couple went into the accused’s bedroom where they lazed around and talked. The victim noticed that there were a lot of beer bottles in the bin of the accused’s room.

10     Suddenly the accused brought up the victim’s past relationships and yelled at her. When she asked him what was wrong, he punched her on the face before calming down. The force of the blow caused the victim to bite down on her own cheek, and blood came out from her mouth. The victim realised that something was not right with the accused and tried to leave the room.

11     However, the accused again started to interrogate her about her past relationships and threw another punch at her. The victim was shocked as the accused’s actions caused her to suffer bodily pain. She left the unit after the accused had ceased being violent towards her.

12     The following day, the accused contacted the victim and apologised by saying that he had anger management issues and that he regretted what had happened the day before. He promised that it would not happen again. The victim chose to accept the accused’s apology and promise, and continued to stay in the relationship with him.

### The 5th VCH charge

13     On 29 March 2017, the victim told the accused over the phone that she wanted to end her relationship with him. This was met with harsh verbal abuse by the accused. The victim thus hung up the line and proceeded to ignore the accused’s subsequent missed calls and messages.

14     The next day, on 30 March 2017 at about 8 am, the victim was on her way to work when she ran into the accused waiting for her underneath her flat. On seeing her, the accused tightly grabbed the victim’s left hand and dragged her into his car, which was parked nearby. The victim struggled as the accused tried to push her into the car by the driver’s side, while he also hit her several times. The victim tried to press the car horn to attract the attention of passers-by for help. During this struggle, the accused punched the victim in her face, causing her to let go of the car horn. The accused finally succeeded in pushing the victim into the passenger seat of the car. The struggle lasted around five to ten minutes.

15     The accused drove them to his home, where he brought the victim into his bedroom. The accused locked the door to his bedroom. In his bedroom, the accused punched the victim in the face.

16     The accused poured apple juice all over the victim and the air-conditioning was turned on while she was drenched. The victim felt cold and asked the accused several times to let her change out of her wet clothes. The accused subsequently allowed the victim to change into his clothes, but soon after again poured apple juice over the victim’s head. Eventually, the accused allowed the victim to take a shower.

17     The accused refused to let the victim leave even though she told him that she needed to get a medical certificate to excuse her absence from work that day. Eventually, after pleading with him several times, the accused allowed her to leave his home. The victim thereafter sought medical attention in respect of her injuries.

18     According to a medical report dated 11 April 2017 prepared by Dr Teo Sze Yang Alex, Medical Director of Providence Clinic, the victim was observed with bruising on her left cheek and right lower eye, with tenderness and swelling over the facial injury. The victim was treated symptomatically with analgesia and was given medical leave for two days. She was diagnosed with facial contusion with possible assault injury.

## Facts relating to the VCGH and wrongful confinement charges

19     As the accused has not appealed against his conviction after trial on these two charges, I shall set out only the salient facts from the trial.

### The assault

20     In the early hours of 27 August 2017, the accused’s father, Teo Kim Poh (“DW 2”) called “999” after he was awakened by the cries of the victim who was locked in the accused’s bedroom. The accused’s father’s call was logged as the First Information Report at 4.12am which stated “Here got dispute, need police”.

21     When the police arrived at around 4.20 am, Staff Sergeant Muhammad Jauhary bin Sabiri (“PW 2)(“S/Sgt Jauhary”) testified that the accused’s bedroom door was locked from the inside and there was a female who was periodically crying and screaming from inside the room[^1]. S/Sgt Jauhary and his colleagues ascertained from the victim that she was injured, was unable to get out and that she wanted to get out of the accused’s room[^2]. The police eventually had to break down the accused’s bedroom door in order to gain entry. They found that the victim badly injured with the accused lying face down in the room.

22     The victim testified that they had had a night of eating, drinking and singing at the KTV and after they arrived home, the accused wanted to have intercourse with her but she did not want to. He then pulled her shorts off and penetrated her while she lay unmoving on the bed. When she expressed her displeasure by saying, “Why is it always about what you want?” he began to assault her, locking her in the room when she tried to escape and continually assaulting her until the arrival of the police.

### Injuries sustained by the victim

23     The victim’s medical report disclosed multiple facial fractures, a fracture of her little finger as well as a brain hemorrhage.

24     Specifically, the victim suffered the following fractures:

> a)     Nasal bone;

> b)     Bony nasal septum with soft tissue swelling;

> c)     Right infraorbital rim and orbital floor, involving the infraorbital canal;

> d)     Right maxilla, anterior, medial and lateral walls, with haemoantrum;

> e)     Left infraorbital rim, involving the infraorbital canal. No herniation of left orbital contents; and

> f)     Left maxilla, anterior wall, with small amount of haemoantrum.

25     The victim also sustained a displaced oblique fracture of the left little finger metacarpal shaft with radial displacement of the distal fragment and surrounding soft tissue swelling

26     She was treated by the psychiatry department for acute stress disorder. As a result of the various medical procedures she was hospitalised a total of 20 days.

27     Dr Stephanie Chan (PW 5), a senior resident with the Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery Department at the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) testified that the victim was initially admitted on 27 August 2017 to the neurosurgical department as a result of her brain injuries. The neurosurgeon informed that it was unsafe for the victim to undergo general anaesthesia to treat her facial fractures until there was evidence that the brain swelling or cerebral oedema had resolved or reduced in size. Hence, they repeated another CT brain scan on the 4 September 2017 which showed a decrease in brain swelling and gave the green light for surgery on the 5 September 2017 under general anaesthesia

### The defence at trial

28     At the trial, the defence did not dispute that the accused had committed the actus reus of the offence by confining her in his bedroom and assaulting her. However, the defence submitted that the accused had had an alcoholic amnesic episode at the material time and was so intoxicated that he did not have the requisite mens rea to commit the offences under section s 86(2) Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) which would have entitled him to an acquittal.

29     Both sides called experts to testify on the accused’s intoxication defence. At the end of the trial, I found that the accused has failed to show on a balance of probabilities that he lacked the intent to commit the offences and convicted him accordingly on the VCGH charge and wrongful confinement charges.

## Antedecents

30     The accused had a non related antecedent for drink driving and driving without due care and attention in 2010.

## Victim impact statement

31     The prosecution tendered a victim impact statement in relation to the VCGH charge for the purposes of sentencing. In the statement, the victim stated that she had suffered a broken eye socket, fractured facial bones, a broken nose, bleeding in the brain and a fractured left hand. A plate had been inserted underneath her right eyeball in order to prevent her eye from going out of place. She underwent reconstructive surgery for a broken nose, with screws and plate inserted into her fractured left hand. She continues to feel discomfort in her right eye area that feels puffed up as well as numbness on her nose. There is a possibility for her right eye to sink and become uneven eventually.

32     After the surgery on her hand, it became extra sensitive. She feels pain when she come into contact with objects used on a day to day basis. She has scarring on her left hand due to the surgery. She might have to go through another surgery to remove the screws and plate, and there may be complications during the removal of screws and plate from her left hand. Initially it was difficult to use her left hand as it was painful. She had difficulty eating, bathing, carrying things and doing everyday things. As she was an active piano student, it had also affected her progress for some time.

33     She had spent more than $10,000 on medical expenses.

34     Her hand phone was damaged during the assault when the accused damaged it to prevent her from calling the police.

35     Apart from her physical injuries, the victim has been affected emotionally and psychologically. Since the incident to date, she feels a sense of panic for no apparent reason, where she is in a heightened state of awareness which drains her physically. Upon her return to work, her self-esteem has been affected. She is afraid whenever she goes out to work that the accused might ambush her out of nowhere. She also has regular headaches whenever she is at work and has to take medication for that.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

36     In _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“_BDB_”) the Court of Appeal set out the sentencing framework for VCGH offences. The prosecution submitted based on the _BDB_ sentencing framework, the indicative starting point for the injuries suffered by the victim in the present case should be 3 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution proposed a further uplift of 6 months as well as caning of 6 strokes on account of the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     The accused’s assault on the victim was entirely one-sided, and was completely unprovoked. The victim was defenceless against the accused, who was much bigger and stronger than her;

> (b)     The assault was a gross abuse of the bond of trust and interdependency that the accused had shared with the victim by virtue of their romantic and intimate relationship. There was accordingly a strong need for general deterrence;

> (c)     The accused had trapped the victim in his room, such that she was at his mercy and had no easy means of escape;

> (d)     The accused had intentionally targeted the victim’s face, a vulnerable part of her body. He was relentless in his assault and only ceased upon the arrival of the police; and

> (e)     This was the third occasion on which the accused had physically abused the victim, with the severity of his assaults escalating with each episode.

37     On the wrongful confinement charge, the prosecution submitted that the applicable sentencing framework had been set out by the High Court in _Chua Siew Peng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1247</span> (“_Chua Siew Peng_”) at \[114\]-\[126\]. In the present case, the relevant factors to be considered under the _Chua Siew Peng_ framework were:

> (a)     The short period of confinement (two hours);

> (b)     The accused had wrongfully confined the victim to facilitate his assault on her; and

> (c)     The victim in fact suffered serious injuries that were facilitated by the wrongful confinement.

38     The prosecution sought a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for the wrongful confinement charge.

39     For the 3rd VCH charge, the prosecution submitted that the present case fell within Band 1 (fine to a 4-week imprisonment term) of the High Court’s sentencing framework in _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”), but that an upward adjustment was warranted in order to account for the aggravating features of the offence in this 3rd charge, namely:

> (a)     the accused’s assault on the victim was one-sided and unprovoked;

> (b)     he had punched her twice on this occasion; and

> (c)     the accused had targeted the victim’s face, a vulnerable part of her body.

40     The prosecution sought a 1 week imprisonment term was warranted in the circumstances for the 3rd VCH charge.

41     For the 5th VCH charge, the prosecution submitted that a sentence at the upper most end of Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework, namely 4 weeks’ imprisonment, was warranted in on the basis of the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     The similar TIC 4th charge showed the sustained nature of the assault over a prolonged period of time;

> (b)     The accused had forcefully taken the victim to his home against her will and had thereafter prevented her from leaving; and

> (c)     Beyond causing just physical pain to the victim, the accused had also humiliated her and caused her to suffer mental anguish by drenching her in apple juice.

42     The breakdown of the sentences sought by the prosecution was as follows:

43     The prosecution sought a global sentence of 4 years’ and 5 weeks’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane with the sentences in the 1st, 3rd and 5th charges to run consecutively.

## Defence’s submissions on sentence

### Indicative starting point for VCGH charge

44     The defence submitted that the duration of the assault was not more than 1-2 minutes and was not deliberate or premeditated. It occurred at the spur of a moment after a happy night out with the victim. Unlike the victim in _BDB_ who was a 4-year-old child, the victim in the present case was an adult and not a vulnerable victim.

45     The defence relied on a number of sentencing precedents and submitted that the indicative starting point for the present case should be 18 – 24 months’ imprisonment. Specifically the defence relied on the following cases:

### Caning

46     The defence claimed that prior to trial, the prosecution had indicated that they would not seek caning as a punishment against the accused if he pleaded guilty. The accused should therefore not be penalised with “the draconian punishment” of caning simply because he had claimed trial.

47     Further, there were a number of cases in the prosecution’s list of sentencing precedents where caning had not been imposed against the offenders even if they had claimed trial. Given the similar nature of injuries inflicted, the defence submitted that it would be erroneous in principle to impose caning against the accused.

### Mitigating factors

48     The defence submitted that there was prosecutorial delay as the accused was charged in 2017, but the trial only commenced in November 2019. This was due to the prolonged police investigation based on the complaint of rape against the accused by the victim which he had contested as they were in a romantic relationship, While the prosecution eventually did not pursue any charge of rape, this delay had caused periods of significant anxiety and uncertainty for him and his family. In this regard, the defence relied on the High Court decision of _Mai Xuezhong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 99</span> (“_Mao Xuezhong_”) which stated at \[44\] that “Delay in prosecution may also be taken into account by the court at the sentencing stage in appropriate cases.”

49     The defence submitted that the accused’s mental responsibility was diminished due to his long standing battle with alcohol use disorder, as testified by its expert Dr Winslow at the trial. Since the incident giving rise to the VCGH charge in 2017, the accused had abstained from alcohol. The defence submitted that the accused’s behaviour was wholly uncharacteristic outside the influence of alcohol.

50     The accused had displayed remorse by compensating the victim monetarily although this was not broached earlier as his bail conditions prevented him from approaching the victim. The defence noted that while the accused had claimed trial instead of pleading guilty at the onset, mitigating weight could be given for the limited issue that he had raised at the trial, solely on his defence of intoxication.

51     Taking into account the mitigating factors, the defence submitted that the sentence for the VCGH should be revised downwards at Step 2 of the _BDB_ framework from the indicative starting point of 18 to 24 month’s imprisonment to 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment with no caning.

### Wrongful confinement and VCH charges

52     The defence submitted that a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate in the circumstances and given that the wrongful confinement offence was part of the same transaction as the VCGH charge, the term of imprisonment should run concurrently with that of the VCGH charge.

53     With respect the 3rd and 5th charge, the defence submitted the offences were not premeditated as they were committed while the accused was drunk and not in a proper state of mind. Further, the injuries were minor and the assaults lasted a short duration. The culpability was low as it did not involve use of any weapon or group attack and the case fell within Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework. The defence submitted that the custodial threshold had not been crossed, and a fine would be an appropriate sentence for each VCH charge.

54     The breakdown of the sentences sought by the defence were as follows:

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

### Sentence for the VCGH charge

#### Sentencing framework for VCGH offences

55     In _BDB_, the Court of Appeal laid down the following 2-step approach to be applied in sentencing offenders for VCGH offences:

> (a)     First step – An indicative starting point for sentencing should be based on the seriousness of the injuries.

> (b)     Second step – The starting point should then be adjusted upward or downward based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability on an assessment of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors present on the particular facts of the case.

56     Both sides had submitted a number of sentencing precedents pre and post _BDB_. I found the pre-_BDB_ decisions to be less helpful given that they would not have applied the Court of Appeal’s sentencing framework in _BDB_. For instance, _James Daniel Rhodes_ was a pre-_BDB_ decision. _Rajenthirun_ was decided immediately after _BDB_ but no reference was made by the court to the _BDB_ framework in its grounds of decision.

57     Further, a number of sentencing precedents relied on by both sides were cases in which the accused had pleaded guilty. Such cases would typically have incorporated a sentencing discount for the plea of guilt and the eventual sentence needs to be seen in that light. Should the accused person had claimed trial in those cases, they would ordinarily have received higher sentences.

58     More importantly, the Court of Appeal in _BDB_ held at \[56\] that “_where multiple fractures of the type and gravity described in the sixth charge against the accused in BDB are caused_, the _starting point is an imprisonment term of around 3 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment”._ The injuries sustained by the victim in _BDB_ in respect of the sixth charge were fractures to his left elbow, left calf, and his right 8th to 11th ribs.

59     In _PP v Win Thu Ya_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 204</span> (“_Win Thu Ya_”) the accused punched the victim in the face a few times in the course of a fight. The fight had arisen from a quarrel over a common love interest, causing the victim to sustain 4 facial fractures. The victim had also punched the accused in his left eye, and the accused sustained a fracture to his finger and contusion with abrasion on his left upper eyelid as a result. The accused had initially claimed trial but pleaded guilty on the first day of trial.

60     In sentencing the accused, the district judge relied on _BDB_ and pegged the indicative starting point at 3 years’ imprisonment. In this regard, the court considered that the victim was an adult unlike the young child in _BDB_, and also that the injuries he suffered were considerably less serious than those of the child in _BDB_ where the starting point was 3 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment_._ The court found that the mitigating factors (being the offender’s clean record and genuine remorse demonstrated by his paying for the victim’s medical bills) outweighed the aggravating features of the assault, and accordingly calibrated the sentence down to 30 months’ imprisonment. The accused’s appeal lapsed.

61     I found the court’s approach in _Win Thu Ya_ instructive in that it had benchmarked the injuries sustained by the victim relative to the injuries sustained by the victim in _BDB._ This resulted in the indicative starting point of 3 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment for the injuries in _BDB_ revised downwards to 3 years’ imprisonment.

62     By way of comparison, the district judge in _Muhammad Fuad Kamroden_ (relied on by the defence) found that the fractures in _Win Thu Ya_ were worse in nature as they were concentrated not only on the nose but at the vulnerable left eye region too. As such, the district judge in _Muhammad Fuad Kamroden_ adopted an indicative starting point of 2 years’ imprisonment. In _Pettijohn William Samuel_ (relied on by the defence), the victim suffered similar but fewer facial fractures (sustained on the left orbital floor and maxillary walls and the left zygomatic arch) than the victim in the present case. In _Rajenthirun’s_ case, the victim suffered multiple fractures to the head but was on medical leave for 8 days, unlike the victim in the present case who was hospitalised for 20 days.

63     Apart from the physical injuries, the emotional injuries suffered by the victim are also relevant. In _PP v Kwong Kok Hing_ \[2008\] 2 SLR (R) 684 at \[22\] the Court of Appeal held that “hurt” can “extend to non-physical injury, eg mental harm” and held at \[27\] that “long term psychological harm…is a relevant, and indeed often, crucial sentencing consideration.”

64     The victim was treated by the SGH psychiatric department for acute stress disorder during her 20 day hospitalisation. From her victim impact statement, she has stated that since the assault to date, she continues to feel a sense of panic for no apparent reason, where she is in a heightened state of awareness which drains her physically. Upon her return to work, her self-esteem has been affected. She is afraid whenever she goes out to work, that the accused might ambush her out of nowhere.

65     In my view, the victim in the present case sustained fractures on both the nose, left and right eye region as well as to her hand, together with a brain haemorrhage and acute stress disorder. Taking both physical and non-physical emotional injuries in totality, the indicative starting point should be no less than that of _Win Thun Ya_. I accordingly adopted an indicative starting point of 3 years’ imprisonment at the first step of the _BDB_ framework.

#### Duration of assault

66     This was a point of contention between the parties. The defence submitted that the assault lasted only 1-2 minutes. The prosecution clarified that its case was not that the accused had beat the victim repeatedly for 2 hours but that the accused beat victim periodically in short bursts with breaks in between during the course of 2 hours. It submitted that this was consistent with what the accused’s father had heard, namely sobs and noises on three separate occasions, when he had been awoken from his sleep.

67     The victim testified at trial that the assault took place over a period of 2 hours[^3]:

> The whole beating took like, what, over 2 hours or something. As it was happening, I think a lot of things that were irrelevant slipped out of my mind. All I could remember was what---at that point of time for 2 hours what Clarence did to me physically.

68     The accused’s father testified that he had been awoken by crying sounds from the accused’s bedrooms three times, and he had called the police after he had ascertained that the victim was “not okay” which he interpreted to mean that she was hurt[^4]. The call to the police was made at 4.12 am. When the police arrived some 10-15 minutes later, they assessed that the victim was hurt in a life threatening situation which required them to break down the accused’s locked bedroom door. In this regard, the evidence of S/Sgt Jauhary was as follows[^5]:

> So while calling out to her, uh, we asked her, uh, “Are you injured?” And she---she said “Yes.” Uh, “Can you get out?” And she said, “No.” “Do you want to get out?” Then she said “Yes.” And then she continued screaming. So that’s where we realised that, you know, I believe that she was hurt and that’s where _my TL made the decision to, uh, actually allow one of the officer, uh, SC ‘Pong’ to break down the door_, lah, _because it was---we felt that it was life threatening_. \[Emphasis added\]

69     To my mind, the evidence irrefutably showed that the victim was clearly in distress from the time the accused’s father was repeatedly woken up by her cries to the time when the police eventually broke down the door as they were concerned that her life was threatened. The victim had testified that she tried to leave the room in order to escape from the accused but the accused then locked the door and also damaged her phone to prevent her from calling the police. All these events would have spanned a considerable period of time closer to the victim’s 2 hours’ estimation (where there were intermittent assaults by the accused on the victim) and not 1-2 minutes as the defence contended. As such, I rejected the defence submission that the assault would have lasted only 1-2 minutes.

70     I next considered whether there was a need for a further adjustment at the second step of the _BDB_ framework in view of the culpability of the accused, taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors.

#### Aggravating factors

71     In _BDB_, the Court of Appeal made following observations at the relevant considerations at the second step of the _BDB_ framework with regard to manner and duration of the attack at \[64\]

> _The viciousness of the offender’s actions may be inferred from the circumstances of the attack, such as the frequency and recurrence of the attacks, and the length of time over which the attacks are carried out._ The focus here is not on the direct consequences of the attack, namely, the injuries inflicted, since that has already been properly taken into consideration at the first stage of the sentencing process when determining the appropriate indicative starting point..._Rather, the focus here is on the offender’s culpability, and this will entail an inquiry into whether there was cruelty in the manner of the attack and whether the victim’s agony was exacerbated by the manner in which the injuries were inflicted._

> \[Emphasis added\]

72     In this regard, I found the following aggravating factors in the present case:

> (a)     The accused targeted the victim’s face, a vulnerable part of the body. During the trial, the victim explained that the accused deliberately targeted only her face based on a “deep seated urge” to ruin it[^6]:

>> Oh, um, _knowing from past experience, from the way Clarence hit me, he would always just hit my face, he will not hit any part of my body and knowing him, I know where it stems from, like he---he---he has this like deep-seated urge to like ruin my face_, like, he---anytime he’s angry, he will like say to me, like, “Oh, you think you’re very pretty, is it? You’re not fi---you’re not pretty, okay?” It’s like---yah. _So I feel like when he hits my face it’s just like---comes from this like inner anger, that he needs to ruin my---my face_. Yah. So he won’t touch any of my body, he just like go for the face. Um---yah, _the previous time he hit me, it wi---it’s always just the face. Just the face_. \[Emphasis added\]

> (b)     The accused’s assault on the victim was entirely unprovoked and one-sided. The victim unable to defend herself against his assault and when she tried to protect her face with her left hand, she sustained a fracture in the process.

> (c)     The accused locked the door of his room when she tried to escape in order to facilitate his assault on her. Her evidence in court was as follows[^7]:

>> From the bed, right, I got up, I just ran to the door. I---I tried to open the door. I--the---the door is like this little lever thing. I tried to open the lever. I---I managed to pull open the door. When I managed to pull open the door, um, he grabbed my hair---he grabbed my hair, he yanked my hair back real hard. Then, um, I fell like---I fell on my back---I fell on my back. When I fell my back, uh, I quickly got up with him. I went to my---then I real---then---then he went to the door, he closed the door, he pushed the door back, and he took---he locked it like its little tiny lock thing, he used his finger to twist the lock back. He twist the lock back.

> (d)     When she tried to call the police for help, he stopped her from doing so and damaged her mobile phone. Her evidence in court was as follows[^8]:

>> Uh, I---I went there to get my bag to take my phone, _because I know I need to call the police right now or I---I--there---I just need to call the police right now. And he grabbed the phone from my hand and he just threw the phone away_. At that point I didn’t know, uh, but like my phone, lah, after that, the whole thing just shattered. Th---all the glass was shattered. But anyway, um, he threw my phone away, I thought that’s it, like, there’s just no way out for me anymore. So---but I still tried to, uh, run away from him. \[Emphasis added\]

> (e)     This was the _third time_ which he had assaulted her, the earlier instances having arisen from the 3rd and 5th VCH charges. In court, she testified that the previous assaults came to her mind to explain why she needed to get out of the accused’s bedroom[^9]:

>> I thought to myself, “He’s going to hit me again and this time I really, really need to get out of his room, because from---_given from what he has done to me previously, if I don’t get out this time right, he’s going to kill me_. \[Emphasis added\]

#### Mitigating factors

73     A plea of guilt may ordinarily be taken into consideration in mitigating the accused’s sentence – see _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ \[2006\] SLR (R) 653 at \[77\]. Conversely, while claiming trial is not in itself an aggravating factor, it would not afford the accused any mitigating discount to the sentence which he would have received had he pleaded guilty and saved the victim from having to testify.

74     In the present case, the victim was required to testify on the traumatic events of the assault and subjected to cross–examination on various personal aspects of her relationship with the accused. The defence subsequently applied to have her recalled to the stand in an unsuccessful attempt to discredit her with her statement to the police.

75     I therefore gave little weight to the belated expression of remorse by the accused at the sentencing stage after a conviction post trial. I did, however, afford the accused a mitigating discount for pleading guilty to the 3rd and 5th VCH charges which I will touch on below.

76     The accused has also compensated the victim for her medical expenses and the prosecution recognised that compensation can be a mitigating factor. Again, given that the offer to compensate the victim came belatedly only after a conviction, the mitigatory impact of such compensation would be significantly diminished.

77     In terms of the defence’s submission that the court should consider the accused’s diminished responsibility in view of his intoxication in sentencing, the defence was unable to cite any authority where this should be treated as a mitigating factor. The authorities in fact point in the other direction. In _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ \[2009\] 1 SLR (R) 115 the High Court held that at \[44\] and \[49\] that a sentencing judge should _ordinarily_ take into account an offender’s intoxication as an aggravating consideration. If the facts showed that the accused’s intoxicated state during the encounter had, by itself, caused the victim to experience an increased state of terror or alarm, then that might be properly regarded as a further aggravating factor.

78     As for prosecutorial delay, in _Chan Kum Hong Randy v PP_ \[2008\] 2 SLR (R) 1019 (“_Chan Kum Hong Randy”)_ the High Court held at \[20\] as follows:

> The effect which prosecutorial delay may have (if any) on sentencing has been incisively examined by D A Thomas in Principles of Sentencing (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979). He notes (at p 220) that the generic practice of mitigating a sentence to alleviate a legitimate grievance which the offender has suffered _as a result of long delays between the discovery of the offence and the commencement of the prosecution, with the result that the offender suffers a prolonged period of suspense and anxiety_.

> \[Emphasis added\]

79     The High Court in _Chan Kum Hong Randy_ also held at \[21\]:

> \[I\]n appropriate cases, the court may exercise its discretion to order a \`discount’ in sentence, if there has been a significant delay which has not been contributed to in any way by an accused person, if it were otherwise result in real injustice or prejudice to the accused.

80     In the present case, there was no investigative delay in respect of the VCGH and wrongful confinement charges and the commencement of prosecution. The accused was, in fact charged on 28th of August 2017, just _one day after the assault on the victim_. While there were investigations into other allegations against the accused which were eventually not proceed with, the defence had failed to illustrate how that had resulted in any real injustice or prejudice to the accused in respect of the VCGH and wrongful confinement trial, which centrally turned on the defence of intoxication.

81     In _Mao XueZhong_, the High Court noted the delay in prosecution had no impact on the decision on conviction and was satisfied that the appellant did not suffer prejudice at the trial. The High Court in fact allowed the prosecution’s appeal against sentence of 24 week’s imprisonment and increased the accused’s sentence to 12 months’ imprisonment.

82     As such, prosecutorial delay was not a relevant mitigatory factor in the present case.

#### Conclusion at 2nd step of the BDB Framework

83     I was of the view that the aggravating factors highlighted at \[72\] considerably outweighed the mitigating factors in the present case, and I accordingly imposed an uplift of 6 months’ imprisonment to the starting point of 3 years’ imprisonment to arrive at a sentence of 3 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.

#### Caning

84     The prosecution clarified that it had never indicated at the pre-trial stage that it _would not_ seek caning, even if it did communicate a global offer on imprisonment in response to the defence’s representations in the event that the accused plead guilty.

85     Quite apart from what representations were made (or not made) by the prosecution or defence, the Court of Appeal made the following observations in _BDB_ on caning for VCGH offences at \[76\]:

> In cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code, _our courts have invariably imposed, in addition to imprisonment sentences, caning of at least six strokes where the offender in question is not exempted from caning under the CPC_. As the authors of _Sentencing Practice_ have noted (at p 266), _caning “is also appropriate unless there are exceptional circumstances”. Where violence has been inflicted on a victim, retribution is likely to be the principal sentencing consideration that warrants the imposition of caning: see Sentencing Principles in Singapore at paras 6.021 and 30.023, as well as Amin bin Abdullah v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 215</span> (“Amin”) at \[63\]._

> In our judgement, where death is caused, a sentence of 12 or more strokes of the cane may be warranted; _whereas where non-fatal serious injury is caused, a sentence of between six and 12 strokes of the cane may be considered._

> \[Emphasis added\]

86     In _PP v ASR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 941</span> the Court of Appeal explained the relevance of the sentencing principle of retribution to caning at \[128\]:

> The principle of retribution holds that the punishment imposed should reflect the degree of harm that has been occasioned by the offence and the offender’s culpability in committing it see _PP v Loqmanul Halom bin Buang_ \[2007\] 4 SLR (R) 753 at \[46\]. Harm is generally measured by looking at the consequences of the offence, for example the degree of trauma and degradation suffered by the victim in this case. Culpability, on the other hand, is generally assessed by looking at the offender’s state of mind when he committed the offence, for example whether the offence was committed with premeditation, out of rashness or under an afflicted mind.

87     The prosecution relied on the case of _PP v Hasni bin Hussaini_, DAC 933427 of 2018 where the accused and victim were in a relationship and the accused assaulted the victim daily over a period of four weeks, resulting in the victim sustaining multiple facial and rib fractures. The accused pleaded guilty to a VCGH charge and was sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The accused had antecedents for being a member of an unlawful assembly and criminal intimidation.

88     In _PP v Foo Shun Xiang_, DAC 914396-2018, the accused, who suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder, assaulted the his parents with a hanging pole resulting in his mother sustaining rib and toe fractures. The accused was sentenced to the 3 years, 6 months’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the case for the VCGH charge.

89     The defence submitted that the prosecution was cherry picking as there were VCGH cases in the prosecution’s sentencing precedents where caning was not imposed.

90     In my view, whether caning was or was not to be imposed in a specific case was necessarily a fact-sensitive inquiry. First, where caning had not been imposed in a specific case, it may not have been within court’s consideration as parties may not have addressed the court on it. In _Win Thu Ya_ for instance, caning was not imposed by the court, but the issue of caning was not specifically addressed by the parties and hence not by the court in its grounds of decision. Secondly, where the victim was not entirely blameless, this may mitigate against the imposition of caning. For example, in _Win Thu Ya_ the victim had also punched the accused in his left eye, and the accused sustained a fracture to his finger and contusion with abrasion on his left upper eyelid as a result. Third, there may be other factors that ruled out caning such as _Rajenthirun’s_ case, where the accused was above 50 years of age and therefore no caning could be imposed by law.

91     More importantly, in view of the Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in _BDB_ at \[76\] that “_caning is also appropriate unless there are exceptional circumstances”_ I considered _caning to be the starting point_ in the present case unless there were exceptional circumstances to justify otherwise. In this regard, having considered the various points of mitigation raised by the defence at \[73\] to \[82\], I did not consider any of these points as amounting to exceptional reasons not to justify caning.

92     Not only were there a lack of exceptional circumstances not to justify caning, there were ample reasons _in favour of caning._ In this regard, I was cognisant of the seriousness of the injuries inflicted on the victim, and the aggravating factors at \[72\], I find that the entirely one-sided nature of the attack on the defenceless victim and the deliberate and repeated targeting of her face, springing from the accused’s deep seated urge to ruin it, significantly increased his culpability. Upon consideration of the serious harm to the victim that had been occasioned by the offence and the accused’s culpability in committing it, I was of the view that retribution should be the dominant sentencing consideration which warranted caning.

93     I accordingly imposed 4 strokes of the cane on the accused.

### Sentence for the wrongful confinement charge

94     In _Chua Siew Peng_ Chan Seng Onn J (“Chan J”) set out the relevant sentencing factors for a wrongful confinement offence as follows:

> (a)     the total duration of the wrongful confinement;

> (b)     the conditions in which the victim was wrongfully confined;

> (c)     whether the wrongful confinement was committed to facilitate the commission of another offence; and

> (d)     the consequences of the confinement on the victim.

95     The prosecution submitted that a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment in the present case was appropriate. It relied on the decision of _Karthi Kesan s/o Raja Gopal v PP_, Magistrate’s Appeal No 83 of 1994, where the victim owed the accused money. The accused, together with his co-accused persons, kicked and pushed the victim into a lorry, where the victim was wrongfully confined. While in the lorry, they further assaulted him, forced him to hand over his belongings, and asked him to strip to his underwear. The accused persons also threatened him with bodily harm if he failed to raise the money. The accused was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment for an offence of wrongful confinement with common intention. The sentence was upheld on appeal.

96     The defence relied on factors (a) and (b) at \[94\] and pointed out that the duration of wrongful confinement was relatively short and the place of confinement (i.e. the accused’s bedroom) was not dirty, uncomfortable or barely inhabitable. The defence submitted that 6 weeks’ imprisonment was an appropriate sentence for this offence.

97     In my view, while the confinement may have been relatively short (2 hours) and the condition of confinement were not dirty, uncomfortable or barely inhabitable, I found that there were significant aggravating aspects in respect of factors (c) and (d) as set out in \[94\] in the present case. Factor (c) relates to whether the wrongful confinement was committed to facilitate the commission of another offence, and the present case bears some similarity to _Karthi Kesan_ in that in both instances the accused(s) had confined the victim in order to facilitate an assault on the victim.

98     Factor (d) requires the court to consider the consequences of the confinement on the victim. In _Chua Siew Peng_ where the victim suffered serious injuries as a result of attempting to escape her confinement, Chan J observed at \[123\] as follows:

> It goes without saying that the severity of the injuries suffered by a victim is a recognised aggravating factor in all offences against the person.

99     The consequences of the confinement on the victim in the present case were especially severe as the accused had locked his bedroom door to confine her and continued to assault her thereby causing her to suffer serious injuries. She was only rescued when the police broke down the door to the accused’s room.

100    Considering the aggravating aspects of factors (c) and (d), I imposed a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment in respect of the wrongful confinement charge.

### Sentence for the 3rd VCH charge

101    In _Low Song Chye_ the High Court set out the sentencing framework for VCH offences at \[77\]-\[78\]. Where the hurt caused to a victim falls within the ‘low harm’ (Band 1) category, which may include minor injuries such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions, the indicative starting range for a first time offender who pleads guilty is a fine or a short custodial term of up to 4 weeks. The court must then make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and all other relevant factors, in particular, the aggravating and mitigating factors.

102    Both sides agreed that the 3rd VCH charge was a Band 1 case in terms of the _Low Song Chye_ framework, but the prosecution sought an imprisonment term of 1 week whilst the defence submitted that a fine of $3,000-$4,000 was sufficient.

103    I note that the facts leading to the 3rd VCH charge appeared to have been triggered on the spur of the moment by the accused having brought up the victim’s past relationships whereupon he punched her on the face. The victim however, did not seek medical attention for her injuries. The accused apologised to the victim the following day and she accepted his apology and continued to stay in the relationship with him. I also took into account the accused’s plea of guilt in respect of this charge.

104    In the circumstances, I was the view that the custodial threshold had not been crossed with respect of the 3rd VCH charge and that a high fine of $4,000, in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment, was sufficient in the circumstances.

### Sentence for the 5th VCH charge

105    The facts relating the 4th TIC charge which was taken into consideration were relevant to the 5th charge as they occurred immediately prior to the 5th VCH charge.

106    The facts of the TIC charge were set out in the Statement of Facts which the accused had admitted to:

> On seeing her, _the accused tightly grabbed the victim’s left hand and dragged her into his car_, which was parked nearby. The victim struggled as _the accused tried to push her into the car by the driver’s side, while he also hit her several times. The victim tried to press the car horn to attract the attention of passers-by for help. During this struggle, the accused punched the victim in her face, causing her to let go of the car horn_. The accused finally succeeded in pushing the victim into the passenger seat of the car. _The struggle lasted around five to ten minutes_.

> \[Emphasis added\]

107    It is pertinent to note that the accused had _assaulted the victim multiple times in a confined space over a period of five to 10 minutes and prevented her from leaving despite her attempts to do so_. The accused then drove both of them to his home, where he brought the victim into his bedroom, locked the door and assaulted her, which led to the 5th VCH charge.

108    In _Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span>, the Court of Appeal held at \[64\] that while a court is not bound to increase a sentence merely because there are TIC offences, it will normally do so _where the TIC offences are of a similar nature_. In the present case, the TIC charge involving an assault on the victim was of a similar nature to the 5th VCH charge and took place immediately before the 5th VCH charge.

109    Specifically, I noted the following aggravating factors in this case:

> (a)     The accused had forcefully taken the victim to his home against her will and had thereafter prevented her from leaving by locking the room door and thereafter punched the victim in the face, a vulnerable part of the body;

> (b)     Beyond assaulting to the victim, the accused had also humiliated her and caused her to suffer mental anguish by drenching her in apple juice. When the victim felt cold and asked the accused several times to let her change out of her wet clothes, the accused subsequently allowed the victim to change into his clothes, but soon after again poured apple juice over the victim’s head.

> (c)     The accused refused to let the victim leave even though she told him that she needed to get a medical certificate to excuse her absence from work that day. Eventually, after pleading with him several times, the accused allowed her to leave his home.

> (d)     The victim’s medical report revealed that she had suffered bruising on her left cheek and right lower eye, with tenderness and swelling over the facial injury

110    In view of these aggravating factors, as well as the 4th TIC charge, I was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed and the present case fell towards the upper end of Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework of 4 weeks’ imprisonment. On account of the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty to this charge, I gave a mitigating discount and imposed a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment.

### Consecutive sentences

111    As I had imposed three sentences of imprisonment (for the VCGH charge, the wrongful confinement charge and the 5th VCH charge), by virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), I am required to order at least two of the sentences to run consecutively.

112    In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen Balakrishnan_”) Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon (“Menon CJ”) observed at \[41\] that:

> As a general rule, a multiple offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.

113    Menon CJ explained the operation of s 307(1) CPC and consecutive sentences in _Raveen Balakrishnan_ at \[52\] as follows:

> The general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences does not contravene s 307(1) or render it otiose. The provision retains its relevance in that it operates regardless of whether the multiple offences are related or otherwise. Therefore, even if all or some of the offences are related, s 307(1) applies to require that at least two sentences should run consecutively. Indeed, in my judgment, s 307(1) of the CPC, the one transaction rule, and the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences should be regarded as complementary principles that collectively help a court decide how sentences should be ordered to run in relation to a multiple offender.

114    On what amounts to an “unrelated offence”, Menon CJ observed at \[69\] that

> ...to say that two offences are “unrelated” means that they are _not_ “part of a single transaction”; conversely, to describe them as “part of a single transaction” means they are _not_ “unrelated”. The two inquiries are two sides of the same coin.

115    In _Mohammed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> Menon CJ observed at \[30\] that “the better articulation of the rationale for the rule is found in the principle that consecutive sentences are not appropriate if the various offences involve a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest” and explained further at \[31\] that “the real basis of the one-transaction rule is unity of the violated interest that underlies the various offences.”

116    In the present case, given that VCGH and wrongful confinement charge occurred on the same day and time frame, wherein the accused had wrongfully confined the victim in order to facilitate the assault on her, these offences involved the single invasion of the same legally protected interest and fell under in the one transaction rule. In the circumstances, I ordered the imprisonment terms for the VCGH charge and the wrongful confinement charge to run concurrently. By virtue of section 307(1) CPC where at least two imprisonment terms had to run consecutively, I ordered the imprisonment terms for the VCGH charge and the 5th VCH charge to run consecutively.

## Conclusion

117    The global sentence imposed on the accused was 3 years, 6 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment, 4 strokes of the cane and a $4,000 fine, in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment.

118    The accused has paid the fine and is currently serving sentence.
