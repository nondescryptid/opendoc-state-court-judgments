7 June 2021

### District Judge Sarah Tan:

1       This is an appeal by the Accused against the conviction and sentence.

## Introduction / Background \[including Charge details\]

2       The Accused, male, born in November 1993, faced one charge (the “Charge”) arising out of an altercation on 13 April 2018 along Prinsep Street:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">You, … are charged that you, on 13 April 2018 at or around 11.00pm along Prinsep St, Singapore, together with Lim Yean Tzia Jonathon and Lee Wee Chyun, and in furtherance of the common intention of all of you, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Seah Kwee Huat Glen, <em>to wit</em>, by punching him repeatedly on his face and head area, causing abrasions below his left eye lid, cheek, left neck, behind left ear, anterior neck, right cheek, right nose and posterior neck and bruises over his right temple, right traumatic conjunctival haemorrhage and right forearm laceration, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition), read with section 34 of the said act.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

3       The co-accused Lee Wee Chyun (“Wee Chyun”) and Lim Yean Tzia Jonathon (“Jonathon”) were the Accused’s ex-colleagues. The three accused faced similar charges under Section 323 of the Penal Code read with section 34 of the said Act.

4       Wee Chyun had earlier pleaded guilty to his charge and was sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment.

5       Jonathon and the Accused claimed trial before me. Jonathon was represented by Mr Irving Choh and the Accused was represented by Mr Sudeep Singh and Mr Dhanwant Singh.

6       At the end of the trial, I convicted both Jonathon and the Accused.

7       I sentenced Jonathon and the Accused as follows:

> (a)     Jonathon: 6 weeks’ imprisonment

> (b)     The Accused: 6 weeks’ imprisonment

8       Jonathon did not appeal either the conviction or the sentence, and started serving his sentence after pronouncement of the sentence.

9       For the Accused, his Counsel earlier filed an appeal against sentence only. A few days later, the Accused’ Counsel withdrew the earlier appeal and filed a fresh appeal against both conviction and sentence.

## Facts

### Background

10     Wee Chyun, Jonathon and the Accused were colleagues at material time. [^1] On the day of the incident, they were having drinks at Alps Café at Prinsep Street. They were with some other colleagues/friends, pictured in the group photograph taken in the midst of the drinking session (“Group Photo”) [^2]. Thereafter, they were joined by Wee Chyun’s girlfriend, Chen Xiu Ling (“Shirlynn”) [^3].

11     Jonathon testified that, as the night wound down, “\[Wee Chyun\] was visibly quite drunk, uh, \[the Accused\] was also quite intoxicated, myself, Daryl, Timothy and Michael, we all had our fair share of drinks as well.” [^4]

12     Shortly after, Shirlynn’s ex-school mates Rita Ng Mei Rou (“Rita”) and Seah Kwee Huat Glen (the “Victim”) arrived at the vicinity of Alps Café.

13     An altercation subsequently broke out, involving Wee Chyun, Jonathon and the Accused, and the Victim.

### The parties

14     Given that the three accused were strangers to most of the Prosecution Witnesses, they were referred to and identified by their attire at material time. [^5] The following is not disputed:

> (a)     Blue shirt (3rd person from the left of the Group Photo): walked away with the girls, before the altercation broke out. [^6]

> (b)     Floral shirt (4th person from the left of the Group Photo): Wee Chyun.

> (c)     Black shirt (5th person from the left of the Group Photo): Jonathon. [^7]

> (d)     White shirt (6th person from the left of the Group Photo, i.e. person on the extreme right of the Group Photo): The Accused. [^8]

## The parties’ cases

15     The Prosecution’s case was that, the Accused, Jonathon and Wee Chyun formed a common intention, and in furtherance thereof, did voluntarily cause hurt to the Victim by punching him repeatedly on his face and head area, causing abrasions below his left eye lid, cheek, left neck, behind left ear, anterior neck, right cheek, right nose and posterior neck and bruises over his right temple, right traumatic conjunctival haemorrhage and right forearm laceration.

16     The witnesses for the Prosecution were:

> (a)     PW1: Lim Jia Qing, Tyron (“Tyron Lim”); an off-duty staff police officer who heard the commotion and rushed from across the road to assist and made the call in the First Information Report [^9];

> (b)     PW2: Esther Tay Yi Rui (“Esther Tay”), Tyron Lim’s girlfriend;

> (c)     PW3: the Victim;

> (d)     PW4: Rita;

> (e)     PW5 Station Inspector Juherman Bin Zaiton (“SI Juherman”);

> (f)     PW6: Wee Chyun;

> (g)     PW7 Doctor Tan Yeong Tze Wilnard (“Dr Tan”), who examined the Victim after the incident;

> (h)     PW8: ASP2 (then ASP1) Zhai Rui; and

> (i)     PW9: Inspector Tan Qi Fang.

17     The Accused’s case was that he was merely a peacemaker. He had seen Wee Chyun behaving aggressively outside Alps Café and was trying to hold Wee Chyun back and prevent him from further inflicting blows on the Victim. The Accused denied inflicting blows on the Victim or sharing in the common intention to cause hurt to the Victim.

18     For the sake of completeness, Jonathon’s case was that he was merely a protector. He had seen someone falling towards the ground in front of him, and was trying to hold this person, who he thought was Wee Chyun based on the hair and the body size, in a bear hug, and was trying to bring him to safety. He only realised after the incident that he was in fact holding onto the Victim. Jonathon denied restraining the Victim to allow Wee Chyun and the Accused to inflict blows on the Victim, or sharing in the common intention to cause hurt to the Victim.

19     The Accused and Jonathon testified on their own defence and did not call any other witnesses.

## Issues to be determined

20     It was not disputed that during the altercation, Wee Chyun had assaulted the Victim.

21     It was also not disputed that during the altercation, Jonathon and the Accused were near Wee Chyun and the Victim:

> (a)     it was not disputed by Jonathon that he had physical contact with the Victim, in that he was holding a person who he thought was Wei Chyun but after the altercation ended, he realised was the Victim.

> (b)     Jonathon also saw a person in a white shirt behind the assailant whom he believed was the Accused.

> (c)     It was the Accused’s position that Wee Chyun was behaving aggressively and he was trying to hold Wee Chyun back.

22     It was not argued by Jonathon and the Accused that the other colleagues/friends, or other strangers, had been involved in the altercation in any way.

23     The crux of the matter was:

> (a)     Whether Jonathon was involved in the altercation as a protector, trying to hold the person who had fallen towards the ground, who he thought was Wee Chyun, in a bear hug, and trying to bring him to safety, or he was involved in the altercation by holding and restraining the Victim for him to be inflicted with blows by Wee Chyun and the Accused.

> (b)     Whether the Accused was involved in the altercation as a peacemaker, trying to hold Wee Chyun back when he saw Wee Chyun behaving aggressively, or he was involved in the altercation by inflicting blows on the Victim.

24     The issues were:

> (a)     Did the Victim suffer hurt?

> (b)     What were the roles of the Accused and Jonathon?

> (c)     Was there a common intention among the three accused to voluntarily cause hurt to the Victim?

25     I dealt with the issues in turn.

## Issue 1: Did the Victim suffer hurt?

26     In the aftermath of the incident, Tyron Lim saw that the Victim was dazed and confused, and had injuries on his face and his eyeball was red. [^10]

27     Dr Tan had examined the Victim on 14 April 2018, following the altercation.

28     PW7 Dr Tan prepared the medical report dated 15 May 2018 (“Medical Report”)[^11], where he noted that “on examination, there were abrasions noted above and below \[the Victim’s\] left eye lid, as well as over his cheek, left neck, behind left ear, anterior neck, right cheek, right nose and posterior neck abrasion. \[The Victim\] also had bruising over his right temple, right traumatic conjunctival haemorrhage as well as a right forearm laceration”.

29     Dr Tan had given the Victim an anti-tetenus toxoid vaccine and medication, as well as 5 days of outpatient sick leave from 13 April 2018 to 17 April 2018.

30     While the Medical Report was admitted by consent, the Accused’s Counsel was not prepared to dispense with the attendance of Dr Tan at trial. As Dr Tan was on duty at the NCID during the COVID-19 pandemic, his evidence was given over video-link. During the brief cross-examination, the Accused’s Counsel however did not challenge Dr Tan on the cause, nature and extent of the Victim’s injuries, or his assessment and treatment of the same. Instead, the Accused’ Counsel questioned Dr Tan on, inter alia, what the Victim had told him as to how the assault took place, which would have amounted to hearsay.

31     The Victim testified that he suffered hurt [^12] and had to work from home for about one month thereafter, as he was not in the condition to meet clients. [^13]

32     As the evidence as to the Victim’s injuries was not challenged, I was satisfied that the Victim had sustained the injuries as particularised in the Charge.

33     I was satisfied that the Victim had suffered hurt.

34     There was no suggestion from the Accused’s Counsel, nor from Jonathon’s Counsel, that the injuries were, say, self-inflicted. I was satisfied that the said injuries were sustained by the Victim arising out of the altercation.

## Issue 2: What were the roles of the Accused and Jonathon?

### The Victim’s evidence

35     The Victim and Rita testified that they had met Shirlynn earlier that evening for drinks near Tai Seng. Shirlynn left and headed to Prinsep Street to look for her boyfriend Wee Chyun, and subsequently the Victim and Rita took a Grab to where Shirlynn was.

36     According to the evidence of the Victim and Rita, they were waiting outside Alps Café, near the railings along the road, when a group walked past them, and Rita recognised Shirlynn and caught up with the group. Shirlynn appeared drunk and was manhandled by Wee Chyun, so Rita confronted him. Subsequently, after Rita pulled Shirlynn away to the toilet, Wee Chyun turned on the Victim.

37     The Victim testified that after saying, “What Bro?”, Wee Chyun threw the first punch to the Victim’s face and he lost his balance. [^14] The Victim was then restrained [^15] by Jonathon, [^16] and was continually being punched on the face while Jonathon was saying, “You can’t do anything. There’s nothing you can do”. [^17]

38     The Victim testified that his eyes were closed the most part of the altercation, and he did not turn his head to look at the person restraining him either. [^18]. He could only make out one person standing in front of him, but the punches came from the front across his face and the back of his head. [^19]

39     The Victim was not able to tell who else besides Wee Chyun punched him. [^20] The Victim could not confirm if the Accused was at the scene or had punched him. [^21] However, the Victim testified:

>   
| 

“\[Victim\]:

 | 

All I know was \[Wee Chyun\] **was attacking me**\--

 |
| 

\[Mr Sudeep\]:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

\[Victim\]:

 | 

**But he was throwing punches in front of my face.**

 |
| 

\[Mr Sudeep\]:

 | 

Okay, can.

 |
| 

\[Victim\]:

 | 

**But there were attacks to the back of my head as well.**

 |
| 

\[Mr Sudeep\]:

 | 

The back of your head.” [^22]

 |
| 

\[emphasis my own\]

 |

  
  

40     The evidence of the Victim as to the areas of his body attacked, as well as the nature and extent of the injuries disclosed in the Medical Report, **did not discount the possibility of more than one assailant, in addition to Wee Chyun**. Whilst Jonathon was close by, by Jonathon’s own evidence he was merely trying to hold the person who had fallen towards the ground, who he thought was Wee Chyun, in a bear hug, and did not inflict any blows.

### Tyron Lim’s evidence

41     Tyron Lim testified on the involvement of Wee Chyun, Jonathon and the Accused in the altercation, and largely corroborated the Victim’s version of the altercation.

42     On 13 April 2018 at about 11 pm, Tyron Lim and Esther Tay had just finished their gaming session at Parklane Mall, which was across the road from the row of shophouses where Alps Café was.

43     They were rushing for the last bus, and Tyron Lim described what he encountered:

> “\[Tyron Lim\]: So I heard some loud commotion of a screaming sound by a lady, initially, lah. So, I turned around and take a look. So, I saw there’s 2 ladies and 1 guy having some sort of argument. And…the guy was trying to basically lay hands on a girl lah, and the girls are trying to walk away from the guy. He---the guy was wearing a floral shirt at the time \[identified to be Wee Chyun\], So, as I was walking---I’m still monitoring the incident…So, after which I saw this floral shirt guy with a man who is wearing a white top \[identified to be the Accused\] having an argument with another man, which is the victim of the case, this case. So, as they were arguing, I saw the floral shirt---the man wearing the floral shirt was trying to assault \[the Victim\] by throwing punches.” [^23]

44     Tyron Lim further testified that as **Wee Chyun and the Accused were trying to assault the Victim**, the Victim tried to block the punches using his hands and was backing off towards the fence by the kerb of the road [^24] Suddenly, **Jonathon grabbed the Victim from behind** by interlocking his hands under the Victim’s hands. Wee Chyun and the Accused were hitting the Victim. [^25]

45     Tyron Lim explained that the area was sufficiently lit as the whole stretch was made up of “night activities shops” such as bars, pubs, pool centres and LAN gaming centres, with the lighting of the shops illuminating the surroundings. [^26] According to Esther Tay, vehicular traffic was quite sparse. [^27]

46     Esther Tay testified that she saw a person in a black shirt, a person in a floral shirt and a person in a white shirt [^28]: the person in the black shirt was restraining the Victim, the person in the floral shirt was “throwing out punches” [^29] and the person in the white shirt stepped in and supported the person in the floral shirt and “participated in the fight” [^30], although I noted that in cross-examination and in re-examination, she conceded that besides trying to hold Wee Chyun upright, she could not remember the exact details of what else the Accused did. Esther Tay testified that “the \[Victim\] couldn’t fight back against \[the group\]” [^31] as he was restrained by his arms. [^32]

47     At this point, Tyron Lim decided to cross the road, which was four lanes wide. [^33]

48     Tyron Lim dashed across the road, grabbed the right arm of Jonathon and identified himself as a police officer. It took a few tries and **only after Tyron Lim had shown his warrant card that Jonathon let go of his grip and Wee Chyun and the Accused stopped the assault**. [^34]

49     Tyron Lim admitted that while he could still see Wee Chyun as he was crossing the road, [^35]**at times his view of the Accused was partially obscured by Jonathan**. [^36] As he crossed the road, he could see Wee Chyun punching the Victim. [^37]

50      **As he crossed right in front of the three accused and reached the kerb, the Accused was back in Tyron Lim’s line of sight**: Tyron Lim could see the interlocking of Jonathon’s hands under the Victim’s hands, as well as Wee Chyun, **together with the Accused, hitting the Victim on the “front areas”**. [^38]

51     Tyron Lim testified:

>   
| 

“\[Tyron Lim\]:

 | 

… **once** I **reached the fence area**, it---it’s **very clear** that both of them **\[Wee Chyun and the Accused\] were assaulting the Victim**” [^39]

 |
| 

“\[DPP\]:

 | 

Now---now, so, at that point when you **reached the kerb** as you call it, yes, you definitely said you **saw \[Jonathon\], holding---restraining the Victim**. At the point he was still holding the \[Victim\], did you see **\[the Accused\] or \[Wee Chyun\], the 2 young men still punching the Victim**?

 |
| 

\[Tyron Lim\]:

 | 

**Yes**, Your Honour

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

\[Tyron Lim\]:

 | 

…I will explain in chronological order so maybe the Court can understand. So, when I **crossed over the road**, I **saw the restraining, I saw the punching by \[the Accused\] and \[Wee Chyun\]**. I to---I grabbed on to \[Jonathon’s\] tricep like I mentioned earlier, I told him ‘I’m a police officer, stop whatever you are doing’… .” [^40]

 |
| 

\[emphasis my own\]

 |

  
  

52     Tyron Lim demonstrated that the Victim’s arms were held behind him, and Jonathon’s forearms were tucked underneath the armpits of the Victim, and Jonathan had put his own fingers interlocking together behind the Victim’s shoulder blades. [^41]

53     Tyron Lim saw that the blows by Wei Chyun and the Accused were to the front facial areas of the Victim. [^42]

54     Tyron Lim disagreed with the Accused’s assertion that he was merely playing the role of a peacemaker:

> “\[Tyron Lim\]:    I disagree. Because like I mentioned earlier on to the Court, from what my view is, uh, the floral-shirt guy was drunk, so if he was restraining, he would have pull \[sic\] him away easily, and not joining him to assault \[the Victim\].” [^43]

### Wee Chyun’s evidence

55     Wee Chyun testified that indeed he had been drinking with a group of colleagues/friends at Alps Café on the day of the altercation, and when they went out of Alps Café, he saw Rita and the Victim. Wee Chyun recalled that a fight had broken out shortly thereafter and he was involved in the fight [^44]. Wee Chyun could recall that he was holding someone, but he could not remember much else (such as how long the exchange of blows took) as he was intoxicated. [^45]

### The Accused’s evidence

56     The Accused testified that after trying to hail a cab, he went back inside Alps Cafe to get his bag, and to make payment, and when he came out, the whole group was still outside, and Wee Chyun was quite aggressive and shouting. [^46]

57     The Accused recalled pulling Wee Chyun off away from the crowd; he was facing Wee Chyun and did not know who was at the back and what was happening at the back. [^47] Because Wee Chyun was quite aggressive, the Accused wanted to just hold him back first: [^48]

> “\[Accused\]:    So, I never really focused who is in front of \[Wee Chyun\] at that point of time because my focus was fully just to prevent \[Wee Chyun\] and to get \[Wee Chyun\] away from the crowd. And that’s when \[Wee Chyun\] and I both lost balance and fall on the ground.” [^49]

58     However, **the Accused’s evidence was internally inconsistent.**

59     On one hand, the Accused testified that **Wee Chyun** was just being aggressive, but **not inflicting blows on anyone in particular**:

>   
| 

“\[DPP\]:

 | 

But you agree with me that there was **no visible target** that \[Wee Chyun\] was, for example, lunging towards? Not to your observation?

 |
| 

\[Accused\]:

 | 

Uh, **yah, not to my observation**, because at that point of time when I came out of the café, um, \[Wee Chyun\] was somehow like back facing me, so **I didn’t really go into detail like noticing who is he talking to or---or who is he trying to being aggressive with**. Then I just pushed him aw---I just pull him away first. Yah.” [^50]

 |

  
  

60     On the other hand, the position advanced by the Accused’s Counsel was that **Wee Chyun was punching the Victim** and the Accused was preventing the fight:

>   
| 

“\[DPP\]:

 | 

So, you heard your Counsel say, “My instructions are that the white-shirt guy was trying to restrain the flight---fight. The **floral-shirt guy was punching \[the Victim\]** and the **white-shirt guy was trying to avoid and resist this particular fight**.” You heard that, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, yah---I mean, I cannot remember word for word like what you just said but, uh, yah, this---this is roughly what he asked the other day.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But yet, in your Evidence-in-Chief this morning, **you said that you cannot recall \[Wee Chyun\] punching anyone, he was just being aggressive**, that’s what you said. **Isn’t there a difference there**?

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Um, yah, but because why I will stop \[Wee Chyun\] and pulled him back is because like what I said, he’s aggressive, as in, **I don’t know whether is he ready to throw punches or what** so maybe it’s just the word that I used for answering and the question, I guess, I---yah. But if you say word for word like what you just mentioned, **yes, there is a difference like with comparing me, pulling him away, not seeing any punches, and what my lawyer asked**. Yah.” [^51]

 |
| 

\[emphasis my own\]

 |

  
  

61     Indeed, the Accused’s Counsel’s version (and not the Accused’s version) was supported by Jonathon’s evidence. According to Jonathon, **after the Victim was hit**, he heard the Accused trying to stop the assault:

> “\[Jonathon\]: … And I **noticed that behind \[the assailant\]**, was actually **someone wearing a white shirt**, um---uh, **which I believed to be \[the Accused\]**, because I could hear that person **shouting** in Chinese, uh, “Bro, bu yao da liao”, which \[translated\] to, “Bro, stop hitting him.” [^52]

> \[emphasis my own\]

62     Two of the Accused’s Statements were admitted into evidence:

> (a)     The statement recorded on 30 April 2018 by Insp Tan Qi Fang [^53] (“Accused’s 1st Statement”); and

> (b)     The statement recorded on 19 September 2018 by SI Juherman [^54] (“Accused’s 2nd Statement”).

63     The Accused’s 1st Statement was **recorded about two weeks after the altercation**, when one would expect the altercation to be fresh in the memory of the Accused. Yet, the Accused offered **significantly fewer details than at trial which took place some two years after the altercation**.

64     The salient part of the Accused’s 1st Statement **merely stated**:

> “While \[Wee Chyun\] and \[Jonathon\] were smoking outside, I went back into \[Alps Café\] to get my bag…When I went out, I saw \[Wee Chyun\] sitting down on the pavement. I went over to help him up. I told Jonathon that we were going home. I helped \[Wee Chyun\] over to the green railing for him to rest…**I had no memory of any fight. I believe that the fight might have started and stopped before I came out of the café.** I also do not remember hitting anyone.”

65     In fact, what the Accused subsequently said in court directly **contradicted** what he had stated in the Accused’s 1st Statement.

66      **In the Accused’s 1st Statement**,

> (a)     the Accused merely mentioned that when he came out of Alps Café, he saw Wee Chyun sitting down on the pavement, and went over to help him up, and helped Wee Chyun over to the green railing to rest, and **the fight, if any, was over**.

> (b)     the mention of the Accused having to **restrain** Wee Chyun came only at the point **after** the off-duty police officer arrived and **when** Wee Chyun tried to go across the road:

>> “An off-duty police officer then came to us and told us that we need to remain at the scene. \[Wee Chyun\] was a little agitated at that time and he tried to go across the road to get a taxi. I was pulling him back and trying to calm him down. He then turned around and choked me in the neck. I do not remember when or how he let go of me…” [^55]

67     Yet, **at trial**, the Accused testified that when he came out of Alps Café, Wee Chyun was quite **aggressive and shouting**. The Accused **then tried pulling Wee Chyun away** from the crowd. This attempt to restrain Wee Chyun took place **before** any off-duty policeman arrived, and **for a different reason** to what the Accused indicated in the Accused’s 1st Statement (which was to prevent Wee Chyun from going across the road).

68     In the Accused’s 2nd Statement, the Accused stated that:

> “I am **very sorry for what had happened**…I admit that I was drunk at that time and my recollection was not that good…I really hope \[the Victim\] is okay and I really want to apologise to him in person. I am **very sorry and remorseful of my action**. I am **hoping for a lenient sentence** as I want to move on from this episode…”.

69     At the trial, the Accused **tried to dissociate himself** from the Accused’s 2nd Statement, by asserting that he had just wanted to get the recording of the Accused’s 2ndStatement over and done with [^56], under the impression that signing such statement would get him off the hook [^57], and he just signed such statement as a matter of convenience and to get away from the investigation. [^58]

70     I found this approach or belief of the Accused unconvincing.

71     At the time of the Accused’s 2nd Statement, the Charge was already put before the Accused, and the Accused was warned to state his defence in response then, instead of at trial later. **The gravity of the situation and the purport of the Accused’s 2nd Statement** would have been clear to the Accused.

72     The Accused’s 2nd Statement was made voluntarily, without any threat, inducement or promise. [^59] SI Juherman testified that the Accused had chosen for the recording process to be conducted in English. SI Juherman had asked the Accused if he had anything to say, and he rattled on the contents of the Accused’s Statement. [^60]

73     SI Juherman acknowledged that he had not recorded in verbatim, but because the Accused spoke in “bits and pieces”, he tried to structure the Accused’s input into a sentence [^61], some of the words he used were to reflect as closely as possible what the Accused meant. [^62]

74     That being said, I noted from the evidence that after the Accused’s 2nd Statement was recorded, it was read over to the Accused and he was invited to make any additions, corrections or deletions, but the Accused had not.

75     As such, I had no reason to doubt that the Accused’s 2nd Statement **completely and accurately recorded** what the Accused had meant to state in his statement.

76     I noted also that the Accused had not stated his defence in the Accused’s 2nd Statement, and the adverse inference should be drawn against him pursuant to Section 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

### Jonathon’s evidence

77     Jonathon’s evidence sought to corroborate the Accused’s evidence that the Accused was merely trying to hold Wee Chyun back.

78     According to Jonathon, after the Victim was hit, he heard the Accused trying to stop the assault:

> “\[Jonathon\]:    … And I **noticed that behind \[the assailant\]**, was actually **someone wearing a white shirt**, um---uh, **which I believed to be \[the Accused\]**, because I could hear that person **shouting** in Chinese, uh, “Bro, bu yao da liao”, which \[translated\] to, “Bro, stop hitting him.” [^63]

> \[emphasis my own\]

79     Further, Jonathon testified that even after he had turned the Victim 180 degrees around to make him face the road, and with his own back towards the row of shophouses at Alps Café, he could still **hear the Accused shouting**, “Bro, bu yao chao liao. Bro, bu yao da liao”, which to him translated into “Bro, please stop hitting. And please stop making a scene.” [^64]

80     Jonathon asserted that, “Because throughout the whole time, **I didn’t know who was the one pushing against**, uh, \[the Victim\] and I---I only could **hear that \[the Accused\] was shouting at someone to stop all of this**.” [^65]

81     Despite asserting that he did not know who was the one pushing against the Victim and him, Jonathon was **able to “notice** that behind this person, was **someone wearing a white shirt**” [^66]. Indeed, his testimony was that he could see this person “**wearing white” “trying to pull \[the assailant\] back”**. [^67]

82     This part of Jonathon’s evidence was **internally inconsistent** as well as **externally inconsistent**.

83     Jonathon’s evidence was **internally inconsistent insofar as whether he could see who was behind the assailant**:

> (a)     In some parts of his evidence, he described how he helped the person who had fallen towards the ground (whom he believed to be Wee Chyun) up, and in his struggle, could not see past this person. Indeed, it was Jonathon’s evidence that he kept his head low and did not look past the person he was holding.

>> “Q:    When the vic---when you held up the victim, where was his head in relation to your body?

>> A:    He was just right underneath my eye level…So, if I were standing upright and he was standing upright, I could probably see past his heard. But at the time, in that position…**I could only see the back of his head. My view was blocked**.” [^68]

>> \[emphasis my own\]

>> “Oh, my---I---I **wasn’t trying to look past him**. I was trying not to break my neck if I fell backwards…So, I actually **tucked my chin in to my shoulder**, yah.” [^69]

>> \[emphasis my own\]

> (b)     Yet, in other parts of his evidence, Jonathon purported to be able to see the person in the white shirt behind the assailant, and in fact he **could see him “trying to pull \[the assailant\] back”**. [^70]

84     Jonathon’s evidence was **externally inconsistent insofar as the relative positions of the four men were concerned**:

> (a)     According to Jonathon, the assailant was face-to-face with the person he was holding (“nose to nose”), and **behind the assailant** was **someone wearing a white shirt**, who was “trying to pull \[the assailant\] back”. [^71]

> (b)     On the other hand, according to the Accused, the Accused would have been **between** the Victim and the assailant:

>> “\[Accused\]: So, I was facing \[Wee Chyun\], I was **standing in front of** \[Wee Chyun\], so I don’t know who’s at the back and what’s happening at the back as well.”

85     I noted also that the Accused testified that in trying to hold back Wee Chyun, **both of them fell to the ground**:

>   
| 

“\[Accused\]:

 | 

Then after which, I got no choice to really lock him and swing him back to---to---to---away, lah, away from the crowd. So, I never really focused who is in front of \[Wee Chyun\] at that point of time because my focus was fully just to prevent \[Wee Chyun\] and to get \[Wee Chyun\] away from the crowd. And that’s when \[Wee Chyun\] and I both lost balance and fall on the ground. Yah.

 |
| 

\[Accused’s Counsel\]:

 | 

Okay. After---now, okay, after both of you fell down, then what happened?

 |
| 

\[Accused\]:

 | 

So, **after we fell down**, I remember when I recover, I helped him back up and I said, “Sorry, I got to pin you down because, uh, I remember telling, ‘Ni tai you li, ah’, like, ‘You got too much strength, so I got no choice to make you fall.’ Then he was still aggressive like shouting at me, asking me to let him go. That’s when I got no choice to pin him towards the---the---the green railing at the side, lah, at that moment, standing, so both of us were standing at the railing. So, I was holding---I was holding onto him and he keep shouting at me like, um, ‘Let go of me, let go of me.’…” [^72]

 |

  
  

86     However, there was no mention by Jonathon about the Accused falling to the ground:

> “\[Jonathon\]:    So, um, after a while, the---the person that was, uh, pushing against \[the Victim\], **he actually collapsed, like he squatted down** and I immediately managed to turn \[the Victim\] 180 degrees around to make sure that \[the Victim\] was facing the road and he---\[the Victim\] was safe, lah, basically from attacks or from being, uh, pushed any further. So, my back was towards that row of shophouses at Alps Café. And, um, during this time, I could still hear \[the Accused\] shouting, “Bro, bu yao chao liao. Bro, bu yao da liao”, uh, which translate into “Bro, please stop hitting. And please stop making a scene.” Um, during this time, I felt---I could feel that I was being punched in the back of my head...” [^73]

87     Indeed, I found Jonathon’s evidence to be unreliable in various aspects, including evidence given in his own defence, which was that he was merely holding the person who fell towards the ground (who he thought was Wee Chyun) in a bear hug and trying to pull that person away.

88     Jonathan had a total of three statements.

> (a)     Statement dated 14 April 2018 [^74] (“Jonathon’s 1st Statement”): Jonathon stated that no assault took place. Yet at trial, he claimed that he “\[did not\] remember giving this statement that night.” [^75]

> (b)     Statement dated 30 April 2018 [^76] (“Jonathon’s 2nd Statement”): Jonathon stated that he saw Wee Chyun “swinging his arms around trying to grab \[the Victim\] but he missed and no punches landed on \[the Victim\]”. Further, Jonathon claimed that he was restraining Wee Chyun by putting himself in front of him and using his hands to stop Wee Chyun from advancing forward.

> (c)     Statement dated 19 September 2018 [^77] (“Jonathon’s 3rd Statement”): Jonathon stated, “I’m not guilty as I’m very confident that I did not lay hands on the victim because my involvement in the incident was to restrain Lee Chyun”.

89     I noted that in Jonathon’s 2nd Statement and Jonathon’s 3rd Statement, he took the position that he was trying to prevent Wee Chyun from advancing forward. He restrained Wee Chyun by putting himself in front of him and using his hands to stop Wee Chyun from advancing forward.

90     Yet, **in court, the thrust of his defence changed**: from preventing and restraining Wee Chyun (or any person at all), Jonathon’s evidence at trial was that he was merely helping the person who had fallen towards the ground by holding that person in a bear hug. Jonathan testified that he thought that the person who had fallen towards the floor was Wee Chyun, based on the hair and the body size:

> “\[Jonathon\]:    … went forward to help. Yesterday, I told you that when the person fell in front of me, I thought it was \[Wee Chyun\]. So, I acted on the assumption that I was helping a friend and a colleague in---uh, to be specific, \[Wee Chyun\].” [^78]

91     This **inconsistency between his statements and his evidence in court** could not be satisfactorily explained by Jonathon.

92     In court, Jonathon testified that this case of mistaken identity of the person he had physical contact with was sorted right after the altercation. Jonathon testified that he realised **right after** the altercation that the person he was holding was in fact the Victim.

93     Yet, in Jonathon’s statements (by which time he would have **already realised** he was in fact holding onto the Victim), there was no mention of him helping anybody up from the ground in a bear hug, much less the indication that he thought he was helping Wee Chyun up.

94     In any event, if indeed Jonathon was helping the person he was holding, I noted that Jonathon did not, while he was yet to be pinned to the fence, drag the person sideways to safety.

95     Conversely, it was after Jonathon was pinned to the fence, that he thought to flip the person he was holding around to his right and place himself in between that person and the assailant.

96     If Jonathon really intended to shield the person he was holding from further blows, he could have placed himself between that person and the assailant sooner, and blocked him from further attacks; alternatively, he could have restrained the assailant.

97     I noted also that despite the intervention of Tyron Lim, Jonathon did not release the Victim readily.

### Analysis of the evidence

98     In view of the above, I noted that the evidence of the Accused was inconsistent with his earlier statements, and also with the evidence of Jonathon. The details offered at trial appeared to be self-serving embellishments, to paint himself as a peacemaker.

99     In a similar vein, I did not find Jonathon to be a reliable witness, whose evidence in his three statements and in court differed starkly.

100    On the other hand, Tyron Lim was an independent witness. He first witnessed the altercation from across the road. Whilst Tyron Lim candidly admitted that the Accused was outside his line of vision for a few moments as he crossed the road, Tyron Lim was able to witness the altercation up close and in detail upon reaching the kerb opposite and being in close proximity to the three accused (close enough to touch Jonathon for him to release the Victim). He testified unequivocally that he saw the Accused inflict blows on the Victim, together with Wee Chyun, and was able to demonstrate how Jonathon held the Victim.

101    On the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that:

> (a)     The Accused had inflicted blows on the Victim, together with Wee Chyun.

> (b)     Jonathon had grabbed the Victim from behind by interlocking his hands under the Victim’s hands and held him immobile while the Accused and Wee Chyun inflicted blows on the Victim.

## Issue 3: Was there common intention?

102    In view of the aforesaid, I was satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the three accused had formed a common intention, and in furtherance thereof, did voluntarily cause hurt to the Victim.

103    Both Jonathon and the Accused had actively participated in the altercation. Jonathon actively assisted by restraining the Victim, immobilising the Victim from any escape. The Accused and Wee Chyun inflicted blows on the Victim, causing the bodily injuries particularised in the Charge and hurt to the Victim.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

104    Section 323 of the Penal Code provided as follows:

> “Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.”

105    Section 34 of the Penal Code provided as follows:

> “When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.”

### Antecedents

106    The Accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

107    The Prosecution tendered written Submissions on Sentence [^79] and further argued orally before this Court.

108    The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 6 weeks’ imprisonment for the Accused (as well as for Jonathon).

109    With reference to the principle of parity in sentencing between co-accused, Prosecution highlighted the case of _Chong Han Rui v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span>, which lay down the principle that sentences meted out co-offenders who are party to a common criminal enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other.

110    Prosecution submitted that the culpabilities of Wee Chyun, Jonathon and the Accused were similar, and therefore, the sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment which Wee Chyun received (upon pleading guilty) for a similar charge, would be the appropriate reference point from which to consider the sentence to be imposed on the Accused (and Jonathon).

111    The Prosecution submitted that, while all three accused were untraced, Wee Chyun had pleaded guilty while Jonathon and the Accused had elected to claim trial. While Wee Chyun would have been entitled to a sentencing discount for his timeous plea of guilt, the same could not be accorded to the Accused (and Jonathon).

112    The Prosecution also referred to _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> for its sentencing framework.

113    At the first stage, the sentencing bands for a first-time offender who pleads guilty is:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.0951374207188%"> <col width="26.2288583509514%"> <col width="63.6760042283298%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Hurt caused</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative sentencing range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low harm</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term up to four weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate harm</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between four weeks’ to six months’</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious harm</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

114    The Prosecution submitted that the present case would fall at the upper end of Band 1 at the first stage of the inquiry, based on the nature and extent of the Victim’s injuries. As such, the appropriate starting point based on the injuries caused alone would be 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

115    At the second stage of the inquiry, the starting point sentence is adjusted having regard to the accused’s culpability and all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, and an appropriate calibration can be made for offenders who have claimed trial.

116    The Prosecution submitted that there was a high level of culpability based on the mode of attack (group attack), the manner and duration of attack, and the attacked had occurred in a public place and the three accused had consumed alcohol prior to the altercation.

### Mitigation & Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

117    The Accused’s Counsel tendered a written Mitigation Plea [^80] and further argued orally before this Court.

118    The Accused’s Counsel submitted for a fine, in the sum of $3,500, plus a compensation order, relying in the sentencing norm in the case of _PP v AOB_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 376</span>, <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 793</span>. He argued that _Low Song Chye_ was decided after the commission of the present offence and should not be applicable.

119    The Accused’s Counsel argued that the Accused was a Good Samaritan who went over to help Wee Chyun, who was “engaged in a tussle with another”, but ended up accused of assaulting someone in a group attack.

120    He further argued that the fact that an offence was committed by a group of persons “should not ineluctably be equated with organisation or planning for it could be a case of hot blooded individuals acting impulsively”.

121    The Accused’s Counsel also submitted that the principle of parity of sentencing “may be compellable \[but\] not overriding” as pointed out by the learned Chief Justice in _Soong Hee Sin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 50</span>.

122    The Accused’s various contributions were highlighted: e.g. he had been a blood donor since young, he had donated to various organisations. Even if the Court were to rely on _Low Song Chye_, a fine could still be considered looking the track record.

123    The Accused’s Counsel submitted that claiming trial per se was not a basis to “change the nature of a sentence – from a fine to jail term”.

124    In response, Prosecution referred to the case of _Adri Anton Kalangie v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 40</span>, where the Court of Appeal held that sentencing guideline judgments are by default retroactive in nature and that it is for the Court establishing the framework to pronounce otherwise. The High Court in _Low Song Chye_, when setting out the guidelines for Section 323 offences did not say that the guidelines were only to be prospective, thus it would fall back to the default position of being retroactive.

125    Prosecution also distinguished _PP v AOB_, which involved a single punch over a very short time. Here the altercation was more sustained and “only stopped because of the fortuitous intervention of the off duty police officer”.

126    Prosecution also distinguished the case of _Rachelgina Jasmine Tay Siew Gek v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 176</span>, arguing that in that case, the issue was that the offences should have been dealt together with the offences that Tay had just finished serving sentence for.

127    Prosecution emphasised that the approach was not to penalise the Jonathon and the Accused for claiming trial. Rather, by an early plea of guilty, an accused shows genuine remorse, which is a mitigating factor.

128    In the present case, Wee Chyun had pleaded guilty and thus would have merited the mitigating factor of a timeous plea of guilt. As Jonathon and the Accused had not done so, their sentences should be adjusted upwards after taking reference from Wei Chyun’s sentence.

### Decision on Sentence

129    I sentenced the Accused to 6 weeks’ imprisonment. I declined to make any compensation order as both Jonathon and the Accused had previously made a joint offer of compensation to the Victim, but the Victim had rejected the offer. [^81]

#### Sentencing considerations & principles

130    The sentence to be meted to the Accused must serve the purpose of **retribution and deterrence**, to deter like-minded individuals from committing such offences.

131    To the Accused’s credit, he had no antecedents.

132    I accepted that the Low Song Chye framework provided guidance and the harm cause fell within the higher end of Band 1 in the _Low Song Chye_ framework (around 4 weeks’ imprisonment). The Victim had sustained multiple injuries, to vulnerable parts of his body: parts of his face bore the brunt of the injuries, some near sensitive organs such as the eyes. Five days of outpatient sick leave were warranted.

133    I accepted that there was no premeditation and I recognised that no weapons were used.

134    In assessing the culpability of the Accused, I noted that Wee Chyun had triggered the altercation, but Jonathon and the Accused played equally substantive roles. The three accused outnumbered the Victim, and overpowered him, with Jonathon restricting the Victim’s movements and rendering the Victim defenceless against the continual blows of Wee Chyun and the Accused.

135    The altercation was sustained, interrupted only by the fortuitous intervention of an off-duty police officer Tyron Lim. Even then, when Tyron Lim first approached, the three accused did not immediately bring the altercation to an end.

136    I noted also that the Accused (and Jonathon) had imbibed alcohol before the altercation.

137    When it comes to claiming trial, the approach is not to penalise an accused for claiming trial per se but rather an early plea of guilt is a mitigating factor because it shows that the accused is remorseful, thus warranting a sentencing reduction, i.e. a lighter sentence. An accused that claims trial will not merit such mitigating factor.

138    As the Accused (and Jonathon) had claimed trial, the mitigating weight to be accorded to a timeous plea of guilt would not be applicable to him.

139    I paid heed also to the principle of parity in sentencing between the three accused.

140    Wee Chyun, who had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment. An uplift from Wee Chyun’s sentence would be not be inappropriate.

141    I determined that **an imprisonment term of 6 weeks was appropriate** in this case.

142    Considering the sentencing spectrum, which was a maximum of 2 years’ imprisonment, a 6-weeks’ imprisonment term could not be considered excessively, much less manifestly excessive.

## Conclusion

143    I convicted the Accused after trial.

144    I sentenced the Accused to 6 weeks’ imprisonment. Given the facts of the case, the sentence meted out to the co-accused Wee Chyun, and the case precedents, and the sentencing spectrum of two years’ imprisonment, the 6-weeks’ imprisonment term could not be said to be manifestly excessive.

145    The Accused, dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence, has filed an appeal. The Accused is presently out on bail pending appeal in the sum of $10,000. A stay of execution has been ordered on the sentence in the meantime.
