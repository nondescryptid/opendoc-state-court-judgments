### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

1       The Accused is a 36-year-old male. He pleaded guilty to the following five charges:

> (a)      Consorting Charge (DAC 920821/2019):

>> Consorting with one Muhammad Syafiq Bin Kwajah Fuhruddin Bismil (“Syafiq”) without permission of the Bedok Police Division Commander, while both the Accused and Syafiq were subject to supervision under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CL(TP)A”), in contravention of s 34(1) CL(TP)A.

> (b)      Provisional Licence Charge (DAC 920928/2019):

>> Breaching the conditions of the Accused’s provisional driving licence, by driving without a licensed instructor supervising the Accused and without displaying the ‘L’-plate, in contravention of s 36(5) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”).

> (c)      Drug Possession Charge (DAC 936936/2018):

>> Unauthorised possession of a Class A controlled drug (methamphetamine), in contravention of s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”).

> (d)      Drug Consumption Charge (DAC 932522/2018):

>> Unauthorised consumption of a specified drug (methamphetamine), in contravention of s 8(b)(ii) MDA.

> (e)      Urine Specimen Charge (DAC 936522/2018):

>> Failing, without reasonable excuse, to provide his urine specimen, in contravention of s 31(2) MDA.

2       I sentenced the Accused as follows:

> (a)      Consorting Charge:

>> **One year’s imprisonment** (_statutory minimum_).

> (b)      Provisional Licence Charge:

>> **Eight weeks’ imprisonment plus disqualification from holding / obtaining all classes of driving licences for 30 months** (with effect from date of release from prison).

> (c)      Drug Possession Charge:

>> Two years’ imprisonment (_statutory minimum_).

> (d)      Drug Consumption Charge:

>> **Three years’ imprisonment** (_statutory minimum_).

> (e)      Urine Specimen Charge:

>> Three years’ imprisonment (_statutory minimum_).

3       I ordered the sentences for the Consorting Charge, Provisional Licence Charge and Drug Consumption Charge to run consecutively, yielding a global sentence of **four years’ and eight weeks' imprisonment**, plus **30 months’ disqualification** from holding / obtaining all classes of driving licences.

4       In arriving at the above sentence, I took account of seven other charges that the Accused had consented to being taken into consideration (“TiC”) for the purpose of sentencing:

> (a)      DAC 920822/2019:

>> A second count of consorting with Syafiq without permission of the Bedok Police Division Commander, while both the Accused and Syafiq were subject to supervision under the CL(TP)A, in contravention of s 34(1) CL(TP)A.

> (b)      DAC 920930/2019:

>> Taking and driving a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent and without lawful authority, in contravention of s 96(1) RTA.

> (c)      DAC 920931/2019:

>> A second count of breaching the conditions of the Accused’s provisional driving licence, by driving without a licensed instructor supervising the Accused and without displaying the ‘L’-Plate, in contravention of s 36(5) RTA.

> (d)      DAC 920929/2019 & DAC 920932/2019:

>> Two counts of using a motor vehicle when there was no insurance policy / security (in respect of third-party risks) in force for that vehicle, in contravention of s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act, (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“MV(TPRC)A”).

> (e)      DAC 936937/2018 & DAC 919842/2019:

>> Two counts of possession of utensils intended for consumption of a controlled drug, in contravention of s 9 MDA.

5       I granted the Accused a two-week deferment of sentence, allowing him to commence serving his sentence on 25 March 2020. On 18 August 2020, almost five months after he had commenced serving sentence, the Accused filed Criminal Motion 38 of 2020 seeking leave to file his notice of appeal out of time. On 16 October 2020, the motion was allowed. On 20 October 2020, the Accused filed an appeal against sentence.

## Facts

6       I set out below the facts of this case, as gleaned from:

> (a)     the Statement of Facts (“SoF”) that the Accused admitted to without qualification; and

> (b)     the TiC charges that the Accused similarly admitted to.

7       The Accused was arrested on two separate occasions. The first arrest was on 20 September 2018, while the second arrest was about six weeks after that, on 4 November 2018.

### The Arrest on 20 September 2018

8       On the morning of 20 September 2018, the Accused was spotted driving a motor vehicle at the carpark of Block 107 Bedok North Road. There, he stopped to give a lift to Syafiq.[^1] At the time, the Accused and Syafiq were both subject to Police Supervision Orders issued under the CL(TP)A.[^2] Further, the Accused did not have permission from the Commander of the Bedok Police Division (Bedok being the place where the Accused resided) to consort with any other person subject to supervision under the CL(TP)A.[^3] The Accused’s act of consorting with Syafiq thus formed the subject of the Consorting Charge:

> You… are charged that you, on the 20 September 2018 at about 9.40 am., at Blk 107 Bedok North Road Singapore 460107, being person subject to Police Supervision pursuant to an Order made by the Minister for Home Affairs under Sections 32 and 33 of \[CL(TP)A\], vide Police Supervision Order … dated 2 Oct 2017, was found consorting with Muhammad Syafiq Bin Kwajah Fuhruddin Bismil … , both are persons subject to supervision under the said Act, without the permission of the Commander of the Bedok Division in which you reside and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 34(1) of \[CL(TP)A\] punishable under Section 34(2) of the aforesaid Act.

According to the TiC charge in DAC 920822/2019, this was not the first time that the Accused consorted with Syafiq −he had also consorted with Syafiq one week before that (_ie_, on the morning of 13 September 2018).

9       After picking Syafiq up at Block 107 Bedok North Road, the Accused drove for about 50 metres before he was stopped and arrested by police officers.

10     The Accused possessed a provisional driving licence for Class 3 vehicles,[^4] the conditions of which dictated that he could only drive:

> (a)     under the supervision of a licensed instructor; and

> (b)     while displaying the distinguishing mark set out in Schedule 5 of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Driving Licenses) Rules (_ie_, the ‘L’-plate) on the front and rear of the motor vehicle.

As at the point of arrest, the Accused was driving without a licensed instructor supervising him and without displaying the ‘L’-plate. He was consequently in breach of the conditions of his provisional driving licence.[^5] This formed the subject of the Provisional Licence Charge:

> You … are charged that, on 20 September 2018, at about 9.58 am, along carpark vicinity of Block 107 Bedok North Road, Singapore, when driving motor car SJH9134C, failed to comply with the conditions subject to which your provisional driving licence was granted, to wit, by driving the said motor car without displaying the distinguishing mark as set out by schedule 5 of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Driving Licences) Rules on the front and rear of the motor car and without the supervision of a person holding an instructor’s licence, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 36(5) of the \[RTA\] and punishable under Section 131(2)(a) of the same Act.

11     Given that the Accused was not a qualified licence holder, the motor vehicle driven by him had no insurance policy or security in respect of Third-Party Risks in force.[^6] This formed the subject of the TiC Charge in DAC 920929/2019 (under s 3(1) MV(TPRC)A).

12     Investigations also revealed that the Accused had driven the motor vehicle without the owner's consent −this formed the subject of the TiC Charge in DAC 920930/2019 (under s 96(1) RTA). The owner had passed the car key to the Accused the night before, to allow the Accused to retrieve something from the motor vehicle. The Accused had then failed to return the car key to the owner, who was drunk and took a taxi home.

13     Upon arrest, the Accused was found in possession of, _inter alia_, five sachets[^7] of not less than 8.96 grams of crystalline substance. This was subsequently analysed by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) to contain not less than 6.05 grams of methamphetamine.[^8] The Accused admitted to ownership of the methamphetamine, saying that they were meant for his own consumption.[^9] This formed the subject of the Drug Possession Charge:

> You … are charged that you, on 20 September 2018, at about 9.40 a.m., at the Open Carpark behind Blk 107 Bedok North Road S(460107), Singapore, did have in your possession a “Class A” controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the \[MDA\], to wit, five packets containing not less than 8.96 grams of crystalline substance which was pulverized and homogenized into a powdery substance and the powdery substance was analysed and found to contain not less than 6.05 grams of methamphetamine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the said Act,

> and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 18 July 2007 … convicted of an offence of possession of a controlled drug under section 8(a) of the \[MDA\] and sentenced to 1 year imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date and you shall be punished with enhanced punishment under section 33(1) of the \[MDA\].

14     Apart from the sachets of methamphetamine, the Accused was also found in possession of utensils for the consumption of controlled drugs.7 These formed the subject of the TiC charge in DAC 936937/2018 (under s 9 MDA).

15     After the arrest, the Accused was escorted back to the Central Police Division, where he provided two urine samples. Both urine samples were subsequently analysed by HSA and found to contain methamphetamine.[^10] This formed the subject of the Drug Consumption Charge:

> You … are charged that you, on or about 20 September 2018, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the \[MDA\], to wit, methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the \[MDA\] or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the said Act,

> and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 18 July 2007, … convicted of an offence for consumption of a controlled drug, to wit, Methamphetamine, under section 8(b)(i) of the \[MDA\] and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, you shall be punished with enhanced punishment under section 33(4) of the \[MDA\].

### The Arrest on 4 November 2018

16     About six weeks later, on the morning of 4 November 2018, the Accused was arrested again. This time, he was arrested at 16 Ghim Moh Road.

17     At the point of this arrest, the Accused was again driving a motor vehicle in breach of his provisional driving licence, by:

> (a)     not having a licensed instructor supervising him; and

> (b)     not displaying the ‘L’-Plate on the front and rear of the vehicle.

This formed the subject of the TiC charge in DAC 920931/2019 (under s 36(5) RTA).

18     Furthermore, as the Accused was not a qualified licence holder, the motor vehicle driven by him had no insurance policy or security in respect of Third-Party Risks in force. This formed the subject of the TiC Charge in DAC 920932/2019 (under s 3(1) MV(TPRC)A).

19     Upon arrest, the Accused was found in possession of, _inter alia_,[^11] utensils for the consumption of controlled drugs. These formed the subject of the TiC charge in DAC 919842/2019 (under s 9 MDA).

20     That afternoon, the police tried to procure urine samples from the Accused. Over the span of six hours, the Accused was administered repeated warnings by the police that failure to provide his urine sample was an offence. Still, the Accused failed to provide his urine sample.[^12] He did not have any medical problem that might have excused him from furnishing his urine sample. He was offered water on multiple occasions but he declined to drink.[^13] This formed the subject of the Urine Specimen Charge:

> You … are charged that you, on 4 November 2018 in Singapore, did fail, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of your urine within such time as required by a Police Officer of the Singapore Police Force and you have thereby committed an offence under Sec 31(2) of the \[MDA\],

> and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 18 July 2007, … convicted of an offence for consumption of a controlled drug, to wit, Methamphetamine, under Section 8(b)(i) of the \[MDA\] and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall be punished with enhanced punishment under Section 33(4) of the \[MDA\].

## Antecedents

21     The Accused has a string of past antecedents. Listed below are those relating to drug and traffic offences (these being the most relevant):

22     The Accused’s list of criminal antecedents stops after 25 May 2009. On 9 October 2012, he was detained under the CL(TP)A. Five years later, by order dated 2 October 2017, the Accused was released from detention under a Police Supervision Order (referred to at paragraph 8 above).

## Parties’ Submissions on Sentence

23     The Prosecution suggested that the mandatory minimum sentences be imposed for:

> (a)     the Consorting Charge (_ie_, one year’s imprisonment);

> (b)     the Drug Possession Charge (_ie_, two years’ imprisonment);

> (c)     the Drug Consumption Charge (_ie_, three years’ imprisonment); and

> (d)     the Urine Specimen Charge (_ie_, three years’ imprisonment).

As for the Provisional Licence Charge, the Prosecution sought eight weeks’ imprisonment but said that it would leave the duration of the disqualification order to the court.

24     The Prosecution further submitted that the imprisonment terms for the Consorting Charge, Drug Consumption Charge and Provisional Licence Charge run consecutively, thereby giving rise to a global sentence of at least four years’ and eight weeks’ imprisonment.

25     The Defence agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions as to which sentences should run consecutively.[^14] The Defence also asked the court to show compassion in respect of the sentence for the Provisional Licence Charge.[^15]

## Decision

26     With the exception of the Provisional Licence Charge, the sentences imposed for all the charges that the Prosecution proceeded with were pegged at the statutory minimum. Taken individually, they could not be regarded as manifestly excessive.

### The Provisional Licence Charge

27     This then led to the question of whether the sentence imposed for the Provisional Licence Charge was manifestly excessive (this being the only charge for which I had not imposed the statutory minimum sentence).

28     The Accused’s last related antecedent was in September 2007, when he was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment and disqualified from driving for 30 months, for driving whilst under disqualification (in contravention of s 43(4) RTA). In light of that, the Prosecution asked me to similarly impose an imprisonment term of at least eight weeks for the Provisional Licence Charge, _ie_, equivalent to what was meted out in September 2007. The Prosecution left the period of disqualification to the court.

29     It bears highlighting that the maximum punishment prescribed by s 43(4) RTA for driving whilst under disqualification is imprisonment for up to three years and a fine of up to $10,000. This is higher than the maximum punishment prescribed by s 131(2)(a) RTA for an offence under s 36(5) RTA (_ie_, the offence underlying the Provisional Licence Charge) −the maximum punishment under 131(2)(a) RTA is imprisonment for up to only three months and a fine of up to only $1,000. This differential might conceivably have merited a sentence for the Provisional Licence Charge that was _lower_ than that served by the Accused for s 43(4) RTA charge, all things being equal.

30     However, all things are not equal here. By way of preliminary observation, the nature and potential consequence of the Accused’s conduct underpinning the Provisional Licence Charge bore close similarities with that underpinning his prior conviction under s 43(4) for driving whilst under disqualification:

> (a)     In both instances, his culpability lay in his insistence on getting behind the wheel despite being legally prohibited from doing so.

> (b)     The potential harm from both instances was equally serious: any victim injured by the Accused’s vehicle would have had no recourse to third-party insurance coverage.

While these similarities cannot in and of themselves merit the imposition of the same punishment (particularly given that the maximum punishment for both offences are quite different), the fact remains that the Accused’s offending behaviour in both instances betrayed the same unequivocal contempt for any regulatory strictures which prevented him from driving.

31     Going further back in time, even before the Accused’s conviction in 2007 for driving whilst under disqualification under s 43(4) RTA, he had two earlier traffic antecedents:

> (a)     In June 2006, he was fined $800 for driving without a licence.

> (b)     In April 2000, he was sent to the juvenile home for traffic offences of a similar nature.

32     The Accused’s recalcitrance thus brought the principle of specific deterrence into focus. If an offender displays a tendency for repeated offending, the principle of specific deterrence may allow for successive sentences to cumulatively _escalate_: see _Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 769</span> (at \[55\]−\[59\]) (“_Low Ji Qing_”). Of course, the principle of escalation does not come into play if the antecedents are irrelevant: _Low Ji Qing_ (at \[63\]), but that was certainly not the case here. The Accused’s litany of traffic antecedents had the same thread running through: a firm resolve to snub any ban that our traffic laws might place on his ability to drive.

33     The extent to which an offender is entrenched in his waywardness may be evinced not only by his antecedents but also by the charges which have been taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing: _Public Prosecutor v N_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 499</span> (at \[19\]). In the present case, the Accused’s obduracy was best reflected in how he had, **just six weeks** after being caught by the police for committing the offence in the Provisional Licence Charge, committed the exact same offence _yet again_ (_ie_, driving without a licensed instructor supervising him and without displaying the ‘L’-plate) −this formed the subject of the TiC charge in DAC 920931/2019 (described at paragraph 17 above). Clearly, despite his recent arrest, the gravity of the Accused’s transgressions was lost on him.

34     For the above reasons, I was of the view that the principle of escalation was relevant to the present case. I felt that a sentence falling short of the eight weeks’ imprisonment and 30 months’ disqualification imposed in respect of the Accused’s prior conviction for driving whilst under disqualification (under s 43(4) RTA) would send the wrong signal. The Accused needs to be made aware that if he persists in driving without the requisite legal authorisation (and putting third parties at risk in the process), the punishments are not going to get any lighter. In declining to mete out a lower sentence for the the Provisional Licence Charge, I also bore in mind the aggravating manner by which the Accused had committed the offence. Specifically, he had taken the motor vehicle concerned without the owner’s consent, in contravention of s 96(1) RTA −this formed the subject of the TiC charge in DAC 920930/2019 (described at paragraph 12 above).

35     Still, I decided that the scales would be best balanced by pegging the punishment _at_ (and _not above_) the sentence imposed in respect of the Accused’s prior conviction under s 43(4) RTA for driving whilst under disqualification, _ie_, at eight weeks’ imprisonment plus 30 months’ disqualification. I took account of the fact that the s 43(4) RTA conviction was rather dated (September 2007) and the Accused had remained free of traffic infringements since then (although I also note that the Accused was detained under the CL(TP)A from 2012 to 2017, so it was not as if he had any occasion to commit traffic violations during those five years).

### Selecting which sentences to run consecutively

36     Having decided on the sentences for the individual charges, I ordered the sentences for the Consorting Charge, Drug Consumption Charge and Provisional Licence Charge to run consecutively. This was because all three charges were governed by different penal statutes and pertained to very different legally protected interests: see _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen Balakrishnan_”) (at \[98(b)\]).

37     I also assessed whether the aggregate imprisonment term (four years and eight weeks) violated the totality principle: _Raveen Balakrishnan_ (at \[98(c)\]). In my opinion, it did not:

> (a)     Firstly, the global imprisonment term (four years and eight weeks) was not substantially beyond the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. In the present case, the most serious individual offence at play would have been that underlying the Drug Consumption Charge, which carried a minimum imprisonment term of three years and maximum of 10 years. Without even delving into would be the ‘normal level of sentences’ for this offence, I note that the statutory minimum imprisonment term for this offence would already hit close to three-quarters of the proposed global imprisonment term.

> (b)     Secondly, I did not find the effect of the global imprisonment term to be crushing, bearing in mind the Accused’s past record and future prospects. The Accused is only 36 years old. Taking into account the prison time that would be remitted for good behaviour, he could be released before he hits 40 years of age.

38     In any case, Defence Counsel agreed in his mitigation plea that it was fair that the sentences imposed for the Consorting Charge, Drug Consumption Charge and Provisional Licence Charge run consecutively.14

39     I should add that the Urine Specimen Charge, which was ordered to run _concurrently_, was in fact a separate transaction from the three charges that I had ordered to run consecutively. Those three charges pertained to offences committed at the point of the Accused’s first arrest (on 20 September 2018), while the Urine Specimen Charge pertained to what happened during his second arrest (on 4 November 2018). The Urine Specimen Charge thus clearly related to a separate transaction. Further, the Urine Specimen Charge arose because the Accused refused to furnish his urine sample without reasonable excuse −the charge thus sought to enforce a legally protected interest that was distinct from that underlying the Consorting Charge, Drug Consumption Charge and Provisional Licence Charge. These considerations weighed in favour of ordering that the imprisonment term for the Urine Specimen Charge run _consecutively_ (rather than concurrently) with that for the three charges above that I had ordered to run consecutively. However, I decided against this as doing so would have given rise to an imprisonment term of slightly over seven years. This would have been rather heavy when viewed in totality.

## Conclusion

40     I thus imposed a global sentence of **four years’ and eight weeks' imprisonment** on the Accused and disqualified him from holding / obtaining all classes of driving licences for **30 months** (with effect from date of release from prison).
