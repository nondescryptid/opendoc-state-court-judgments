11     The Prosecution noted that DAC-927906-2019 was punishable with caning, under s 458A PC, as this was the Accused’s second offence under s 454 PC. As the offence was committed on 29 September 2019 while the Accused’s CRO was in effect, he was also deemed to have breached a basic condition of his CRO and was therefore liable for punishment with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of his CRO under s 50T(1)(a) PA.

12     The Prosecution submitted that the principle of escalation ought to apply, “to specifically deter the Accused from committing offences of a similar nature in the future.”[^1] As his sentence for the previous offence was one year and four months’ imprisonment, the Prosecution submitted that his sentence for this offence should be uplifted to at least two years’ imprisonment, with an enhanced sentence of 82 days imprisonment for the Accused’s breach of his CRO.

13     In respect of the 13 charges relating to harassment on behalf an unlicensed moneylender (“HUML”)[^2], the Prosecution noted that there was a mandatory minimum of at least two years’ imprisonment and a minimum of five strokes of the cane for each offence. The Prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors in this case:

> (a)     Out of the 13 properties damaged by the Accused, six[^3] of them involved innocent parties who were not debtors, who were deliberately targeted and harassed in these cases. Where innocent persons are harassed, an imprisonment term of two to three months higher than the benchmark sentence ought to be imposed: _Public Prosecutor v Quek Li Hao_ \[2013\] 4 SLR 482 (“_Quek Li Hao_”) at \[39\] and \[44\]. This would cumulate to two years and three to four months’ imprisonment, along with five strokes of the cane per charge.

> (b)     The Accused also committed 51 of the 55 charges while he was out on bail. The Prosecution noted that , this is an aggravating factor “which reflects a manifested proclivity for offending and constitutes an abuse of trust” placed on Accused persons by the Courts: _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[57\] – \[61\][^4].

14     The Prosecution then stated that despite the cumulative sentence being two years’ imprisonment and three to four months’ imprisonment for each HUML charge, they were only seeking the mandatory minimum of two years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane per charge, as they were seeking at least three to four sentences to run consecutively.[^5] This brought the global sentence sought by the Prosecution to eight to 12 year’s imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, with an enhanced sentence of 82 days’ imprisonment.

## Mitigation & Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

15     In the written mitigation plea, Defence initially sought a sentence of six years’ and two weeks’ imprisonment, along with 24 strokes of the cane.[^6] The Defence highlighted the following factors in support:

> (a)     They had taken the principled approach of asking that the sentences for most of the charges involving different legally protected principles run consecutively.

> (b)     The Accused was a relatively young man with a long road ahead of him. However, the Defence erroneously stated that the Accused is 25 years old.[^7] The Accused is 28 years old.

> (c)     In a report dated 19 June 2020 prepared by Doctors Zenn Chua and Stephen Phang of the Department of Forensic Psychiatry of the Institute of Mental Health (the “IMH Report”), the Accused was diagnosed with a gambling disorder, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and antisocial personality traits with conduct disorder. Whilst the IMH Report stated that these conditions did not have a contributory link to the offences’ committed by the Accused, the Defence nevertheless posited that due to the Accused’s aforesaid psychiatric conditions, he “was less equipped to handle the harsh realities of life” and “struggled to cope with his gambling disorder”[^8], which resulted in his commission of the offences.

> (d)     The period of the offending was not significant and the collective value of the property which was the subject of the cheating and housebreaking charges was not significant, being slightly less than $11,000.

> (e)     The fact that the Accused had not made restitution was due to his inability to do so, and not due to a lack of remorse on his part.

> (f)     The Accused’s antecedents should not be taken as an aggravating factor as he faced enhanced punishments for the HUML and house-breaking charges. Therefore, to count these as an aggravating factor would therefore be to “double count” their effect.[^9]

16     The breakdown of the sentence sought by the Defence in their written submissions is as follows:

17     However, during oral submissions the Defence stated that they had _reconsidered_ their initial sentencing submission and were instead asking for a sentence of _eight years’_ and two weeks’ imprisonment, along with 24 strokes of the cane, in light of the totality of the Accused’s offending.[^10] This would involve the sentences in three HUML offences running consecutively to one another.

18     The Defence also tendered a medical report dated 28 October 2021, prepared by one Dr Raj Kumar Socklingam, a Resident Physician at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Changi General Hospital (the “CGH Report”). The CGH Report showed that the Accused had a history of back and spinal issues, dating back to September/October 2008. As per the CGH Report, the Accused’s most recent examination in April 2021 disclosed an L4/L5 disc bulge and a central disc protrusion with a posterior annular tear over the L5/S1 region on the Accused’s spine.[^11] In this connection, the Defence asked that CGH Report be attached to the Accused’s warrant of commitment after the Accused had been sentenced, to allow SPS to assess the Accused’s suitability for caning.

19     No precedent cases were cited by the Defence in support of their submission for lower imprisonment terms for DAC-923234-2021, DAC-923237-2021 and DAC-923242-202

## Decision on Sentence

### Applicable sentencing principles

20     The sentencing principles of both general and specific deterrence are applicable to this case.

### Offender Specific Factors

21     In determining the sentence for the offences in this case, I had regard to the following offender specific factors which were applied to all offences:

> (a)     The Accused was traced for related and unrelated offences.

> (b)     The Accused had committed all the offences in a relatively short period of time; and

> (c)     He had breached his CRO in two of the offences.

22     In respect of the IMH Report, it was clear that the Accused had knowledge of the wrongfulness of his actions, that he was not of unsound mind at the material time of the alleged offences and was fit to plead.[^12] Accordingly, I found that the Accused was of sound mind at the material time despite his psychiatric conditions and was fully in control of his actions. In my judgment, the IMH Report did not assist the Defence in showing that the Accused had difficulty coping with the harsh realities of life to the point where he was forced to turn to a life of crime to feed his gambling addiction.

### Sentencing Principles and Tariffs

#### The Enhanced Housebreaking Offence

23     Housebreaking in order to commit theft is a serious offence, punishable under s 454 PC with a mandatory term of imprisonment that may extend to 10 years, and also a fine. The gravity of this offence is reflected in the severity of the prescribed punishment.

24     In the instant case, the Accused entered the victim’s house by tampering with the lock of the rear door with a cutter. He then proceeded to steal a number of items, valued at approximately $3,753.14. All the properties have not been recovered, and no restitution has been made by the Accused. The Accused also has an identical antecedent under s 454 PC, for which he was previously sentenced to one year and four months’ imprisonment.

25     In _Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span>, the High Court observed that:

> …the principle of escalation **could justify a longer imprisonment term being imposed on a persistent offender in light of his antecedents** (see _Tan Kay Beng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span>). This may be especially significant if a subsequent sentence for an offender who has already committed the same sort of offence needs to be escalated in order to specifically deter him from committing further offences of that nature: \[99(a)\] (emphasis added).

26     As the Accused has already committed the same sort of offence previously, there is clearly a need for specific deterrence. Therefore, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that an uplift from his previous sentence of one year four months’ imprisonment to two years’ imprisonment was reasonable for this charge.

27     Given the Accused’s related antecedent, he is also liable for caning along with imprisonment, as per s 458A PC. In this regard, as there was a high degree of intrusion by the Accused in his housebreaking offence, I imposed a sentence of six strokes of the cane, to take into account his premeditation of the offence and the need for specific and general deterrence in his case.

28     Finally, as the Accused was also the subject of a CRO at the time of the offence, he was also further liable for punishment under s 50T(1)(a) PA. The High Court in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span>, set out the framework for determining the sentences for offences under s 50T PA as follows:

> (a)     First Stage: Considering the gravity of the fresh underlying offence(s), the accused’s rehabilitative prospects and other relevant circumstances

>> (i)       The gravity of the offence: Abdul _Mutalib_ at \[55\]: “Specific to s 50T PA, the gravity of the fresh offence committed by the offender may be gleaned from, amongst other things, the underlying sentence imposed for that offence.” In this case, the sentence imposed for the enhanced house-breaking offence is severe and involves caning. As such, the gravity of the offence would fall within the moderate to high category.

>> (ii)       The accused’s rehabilitative prospects: _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[57\]: “This consideration finds expression in the factors of the _similarity_ and _timing_ of the fresh offence under s 50T(3)(_b_) PA and s 50T(3)(_c_) PA respectively” Here the Accused re-offended 3 months into his CRO. However, he repeatedly offended after the first breach and committed a number of offences, including the instant offence and other offences. Given his repeated re-offending and his lengthy antecedent history, it is not clear that his rehabilitative prospects are high.

>> (iii)       All other circumstances_:_ Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Accused is a young man with a long road ahead of him. In this case, the Accused’s plea of guilt was already taken into account in respect of the underlying offences, and therefore was not taken into account in respect of the enhanced sentence.

> (b)     Second Stage: Determining the sentencing band the offence falls under:

>> (i)       The High Court proposed the following applicable sentencing framework, which adopts a three-fold classification of “low”, “moderate” and “high”, with each classification being tied to the severity of the fresh offence in question (in the case of section 50T):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="13.72%"> <col width="31.8%"> <col width="54.48%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band&nbsp;</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Degree of severity</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range (based on the remaining duration of the remission order)&nbsp;</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 1/3&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to the full remaining duration&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

>> (ii)       In this case, the Accused’s offence would likely fall into Band 2, being of moderate to high severity. In that regard, he would therefore be liable for a maximum enhanced sentence of approximately 82 days’ imprisonment.

> (c)     Third Stage: The Limiting Factor

>> (i)        _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[55\]: “At the same time, the underlying sentence should, in our judgment, also be regarded as a _significant limiting factor_ in relation to any enhanced sentence that may be imposed under s 50T. Consequently, any enhanced sentence imposed should ordinarily _not exceed_ the underlying sentence imposed for the fresh offence.” In this case, as the sentence imposed for the fresh offence is two years’ imprisonment, the enhanced sentence is not in danger of impinging on the same.

> (d)     Fourth Stage: Application of the Totality Principle

>> (i)       The Court in _Abdul Mutalib_ noted that “…this limb will operate at the last stage of the sentencing process when the sentencing court takes a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances of the case at hand to determine whether the aggregate sentence is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and future prospects”:\[86\].

>> (ii)       In this case, given the severity of the Accused’s offending behaviour, I imposed the maximum aggregate sentence that the Accused would be liable to, being 82 days as sought by both the Prosecution and Defence. On balance, in my view, a sentence of 82 days imprisonment would not be overly crushing on the Accused given the facts of the case, while still providing adequate deterrence to the Accused.

#### The Enhanced HUML Offences

29     In _Ong Chee Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> at \[10\], Chao JA noted that the severity of the mandatory sentences for loan shark offences signalled Parliament’s intention to “strongly deter the commission of loan shark offences.” As the Accused is not a first-time offender, he is liable for a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of two years under s 28(2)(b) MLA. Further, as the Accused had splashed paint and caused damage to the properties, I agreed with both the Prosecution and Defences’ submissions that the Accused was also liable for a minimum of five strokes of the cane for each offence as per s 28(d)(i) MLA.

30     The Accused damaged a total of 13 properties (across the proceeded charges) and out of these, six properties involved innocent parties who were not debtors. The harassment of innocent persons is an aggravating factor which would merit an uplift of two to three months’ imprisonment from the benchmark sentence (as per Tay J in _Quek Li Hao_). Nevertheless, in light of the totality principle and given the lengthy sentence the Accused was facing, I accepted the Prosecution and Defences’ submissions and imposed only the mandatory minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane for each HUML charge.

#### The Cheating Offences

31     The prescribed punishment for s 420 PC offences is mandatory imprisonment for up to ten years and also a fine. As both the Prosecution and the Defence did not tender authorities for the sentences sought for the cheating offences, I took reference from the District Court case of _Public Prosecutor v Lim Shi Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 108</span> (“_Lim Shi Hui_”) for an indicative sentence in this case.

32     In _Lim Shi Hui_ the learned district judge agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the primary sentencing considerations in online cheating offences were both general and specific deterrence and prevention. He also stated that “for online cheating scams…sentences in the range of 3-4 months per charge were imposed where the amount cheated was about $1,000 or less, even for first offenders who pleaded guilty” \[36\]. In that case, the Accused was a seasoned offender with numerous charges against her. She also had a track record of particularly targeting vulnerable victims including partially deaf victims in her mobile phone scams. In this regard, the court sentenced her to two three months imprisonment for each of the online cheating offences which were committed before the accused turned 21. The appeal in _Lim Shi Hui_ was dismissed.

33     In this case, the Accused committed the offences when he was above 21 years of age. Whilst the Accused herein did not actively seek out vulnerable victims in the conduct of cheating offences, as was the Accused’s _modus operandi_ in _Lim Shi Hui_, he nevertheless has not made restitution to the victims. Further, apart from the three proceeded charges, there are also six similar TIC charges against him. Finally, although the amounts cheated were not large (being $850 per proceeded charge), as noted by the court in _Lim Shi Hui_, there is a need for specific and general deterrence in the case of online offences, due to the difficulty associated with their detection. Therefore, I imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment per charge for this offence.

#### The Remote Gambling Offence

34     The penalty for an offence under s9(1) of the Remote Gambling Act is a fine not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 or imprisonment not exceeding five years or both. As both the Prosecution and Defence did not tender submissions for the sentences sought, I looked to the Court of Appeal case of _Koo Kah Yee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 3 SLR 1440</span> (“_Koo Kah Yee_”) to determine the sentence to be imposed in this case. The Court in _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[55\] laid down a _non-exhaustive_ list of the relevant offence-specific factors to be considered in sentencing as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"> <col width="50%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors going toward harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors going towards culpability</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The aggregate value of bets involved</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Involvement of a syndicate</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Involvement of a transnational element</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Difficulty of detection</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Degree of planning and premeditation</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Level of sophistication</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offender’s role</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Personal gain</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Duration of offending</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

35     Here the Accused facilitated the purchase of credits for the complainant to play online poker via an application called “PPPoker” multiple times over the course of three days. During investigations it was revealed that the Accused’s role was merely as a worker in this scheme. The level of sophistication was also low as he messaged people in a general chat group and waited for a response from interested parties (as opposed to actively recruiting them into joining his scheme). The Accused was only involved in the offending for a short period of time, and he does not appear to have derived personal gain from this scheme. As such, the harm and culpability of the Accused in this case is low.

36     However, as per _Koo Kah Yee_ at \[29\], the main purpose of the remote gambling act is to prevent remote gambling from being a source of crime or disorder and protect young persons and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited by remote gambling. Therefore, given the strong need for general deterrence in respect of remote gambling offences, I imposed a sentence of one weeks’ imprisonment for this offence.

#### The COVID-19 Offence

37     In sentencing the Accused for the breach of Regulation 4(2) COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations, as neither the Prosecution nor the Defence tendered sentencing authorities, I took reference from the following unreported cases:

> (a)      _PP v Wang Hainan_: (SC-903733-2020): In _Wang Hainan_, the Accused left his ordinary place of residence to commit two offences under the Moneylenders Act. Here, the Learned DJ imposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for the offence of leaving his ordinary place of residence without an excuse. This is similar to the Accused in the instant case, who also left his place of residence to commit offences.

> (b)      _PP v Lee Chang Hui_: (SC-903336-2020): In _Lee Chang Hui_ the Accused left his ordinary place of residence to commit multiple offences under the Moneylenders Act. In this case the Learned DJ imposed a sentence of 3 weeks for the breach of Regulation 4(2) COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020.

38     In the instant case, the Accused also has 4 TIC charges for the same offence. As such, I imposed a sentence of one months’ imprisonment for this charge, being a slight uplift from the sentences imposed in _Wang Hainan_ and _Lee Chang Hui_, to take into account the TIC charges against the Accused.

#### The Criminal Trespass offence

39     The punishment for criminal trespass is imprisonment for up to three months or a fine of up to $1,500 or both. In this case, as the offence was committed on 28 September 2019 whilst the Accused was the subject of the CRO, the Accused was further liable for punishment under s 50T(1)(a) PA.

40     A non-exhaustive list of the sentencing factors for an offence under s447 PC are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors going toward harm</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">* Purpose of trespass; eg. Annoy, commit offence</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">* Actual/ threatened harm or damage; related damage</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">* Property to which the public generally has no access or government property</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">* Offence committed at night or in the early hours of the morning</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">* Very short period of time</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

41     In this case, the Accused climbed into the compound of No 10 Pasir Ris View at approximately 4pm with the intention to commit theft. Given that the purpose of the trespass was to commit theft, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that four weeks’ imprisonment was reasonable for this charge.

42     The Prosecution did not seek an enhanced sentence for the Accused for this charge. As per s 50T(1)(a) PA, the imposition of an enhanced sentence is discretionary. Given the high global sentence to be imposed on the Accused, I agreed that a further enhanced sentence in this case would be crushing on the Accused.

#### Caning

43     As per s 328(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the court can only impose a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane, where the Accused is convicted at one trial of two or more distinct offences. This limit remains even when the mandatory minimum number of strokes is prescribed for each of the offences for which the Accused is convicted:_Public Prosecutor v Chan Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 14</span>. Applying s 328(1) CPC, the aggregate number of strokes cannot exceed 24 strokes for adults. As such, although the Accused was sentenced to a total of 71 strokes of the cane, the total number of strokes of the cane is limited to 24.

## Global Sentence & Backdating of sentence

44     I imposed a global sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, with an enhanced sentence of 82 days’ imprisonment on the Accused. This sentence was backdated to 5 June 2020, as per s318(5) CPC. However, it is trite that the court’s power to backdate a custodial sentence is purely discretionary and the court is not obliged to backdate the custodial sentence in every case where the Accused has spent time in remand. In the current instance, the Accused was taken into remand for one week on 3 October 2019, and then released on bail prior to his further remand on 5 June 2020. In this regard, I have not taken his prior remand in October 2019 into account when backdating the sentence as this would not result in the Accused being “excessively punished” given the totality of the offending on the part of the Accused: _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> at \[86\].

## Post-Trial Matters

45     Section 331 CPC provides that the punishment of caning may be inflicted only if a medical officer is present and certifies that the offender is in a fit state to undergo the said punishment. On 3 March 2022, the Accused was found to be unfit for caning by the Chief Medical Officer of SPS. In this regard, s 332 CPC states as follows:

> 332.—(1)    Where a sentence of caning is wholly or partially prevented from being carried out under section 331, the offender must be kept in custody until the court that passed the sentence can revise it.

> (2)    That court may —

>> (a)    remit the sentence; or

>> (b)    sentence the offender instead of caning, or instead of as much of the sentence of caning as was not carried out, to imprisonment of not more than 12 months, which may be in addition to any other punishment to which the offender has been sentenced for the offence or offences in respect of which the court has imposed caning (called in this section the relevant offences).

> (3)    A court may impose a term of imprisonment under subsection (2)(b) even though the aggregate of such term and the imprisonment term imposed for any of the relevant offences exceeds the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed for any of those offences.

> (4)    A Magistrate’s Court or District Court may impose a term of imprisonment under subsection (2)(b) even though the aggregate sentence of imprisonment (comprising the term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (2)(b) and the combined terms of imprisonment imposed by the court in respect of the relevant offences) exceeds the limits prescribed by section 306.

> (5)    The power of a court to impose the additional term of imprisonment under subsection (2)(b) does not apply in relation to any offence which is committed before 2 January 2011.

46     In this connection a remission hearing was scheduled on 7 March 2022 at 9am. During the hearing, I ordered that the entire sentence of caning be remitted fully under s 332(2)(a) CPC. During the remission hearing, the Prosecution also informed that they were not seeking an enhanced sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the Accused, due to his ill health. The Defence concurred with this position.

47     In light of the foregoing, I determined that no further enhanced sentence was necessary in the circumstances of the case as the current sentence imposed on the Accused is already a lengthy one. Any additional imprisonment term may be crushing on the Accused.

## Conclusion

48     In the result, I imposed the following global sentence, 8 year’s imprisonment and 82 days enhanced imprisonment, backdated to 5 June 2020. The Accused withdrew his appeal through SPS after the remission hearing on 7 March 2022 and is presently serving his sentence.
