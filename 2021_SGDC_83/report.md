Civil Procedure – Unless orders – Whether an unless order should be made

Civil Procedure – Extension of time

4 May 2021

### Deputy Registrar Jeslyn Tan:

## Introduction

1       This is the plaintiff’s application for an unless order against the 2nd defendant for her persistent failure to comply with a court order dated 23 September 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the “Court Order”) and for an extension of time for certain timelines given in the Court Order. In this application, the plaintiff prayed for an unless order to be made with the consequences of non-compliance being the striking out of the 2nd defendant’s defence, leave to enter judgment and costs against the 2nd defendant.

2       Having considered the evidence and submissions before me, I allowed the plaintiff’s application with a slight variation to the terms of the unless order sought. My detailed reasons are set out in these written grounds.

## Background facts

3       On 11 March 2020, an order was made for the parties to exchange their respective affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) by 9 July 2020 pursuant to the plaintiff’s application made by way of a summons for directions. Thereafter, the parties were engaged in settlement talks and mutually agreed to exchange their respective AEICs at a later date.

4       However, the settlement talks eventually fell through and on 23 September 2020, the Court Order was made for the parties to exchange their respective AEICs by 19 October 2020 pursuant to the plaintiff’s application made by way of a summons for further directions. Notably, the Court Order was granted by consent. The Court Order also stipulated timelines for the taking of objections to the AEICs and the setting down for trial (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “ancillary timelines”), amongst other things.

5       On 19 October 2020, the plaintiff informed the 2nd defendant that it was ready to exchange its AEIC. However, no response was received.

6       The 2nd defendant subsequently informed the plaintiff that she was unable to exchange her AEIC due to “unforeseen circumstances” and would be seeking an extension of time from the court to do so.[^1] However, no application for an extension of time was made even up to the hearing of the present application and the 2nd defendant continued to be in default of the Court Order.

## The 2nd defendant’s position

7       The 2nd defendant strenuously opposed this present application. She emphasised that this was her first breach of the Court Order.[^2] Based on her affidavit, the crux of the 2nd defendant’s reasons for not being able to file and exchange her AEIC in time was that she was located in China since March 2020 with no access to the documents which she wanted to rely on to defend this suit. According to her, the said documents were only located in her place of residence in Singapore.[^3] She was therefore unable to give meaningful instructions to her solicitors to prepare her AEIC. It was undisputed that there was no certainty as to when she could return to Singapore. Furthermore, any such return would be complicated by travel restrictions and subject to quarantine requirements as a result of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.

## Discussion

### Legal principles

8       An unless order is a powerful tool for the efficient and prompt administration of justice. It is a court order requiring a party to comply with a particular direction within a stated timeline, failing which serious consequences will ensue. The consequences, which are attached as conditions to the unless order, can be as draconian as the striking out of a litigant’s claim or defence entirely, as the plaintiff had sought in the present application.

9       In the seminal decision of the Court of Appeal in _Mitora Pte Ltd v Agritrade International (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 1179</span> (“_Mitora_”) at \[45\], the court stated that the immediate purpose of an unless order is not to punish misconduct but to secure a fair trial in accordance with due process of law. The Court of Appeal also set out the following guidelines for the use of unless orders:

> (a)     unless orders stipulating the consequence of dismissal should not be given as a matter of course but as a last resort when the defaulter’s conduct is inexcusable;

> (b)     the conditions appended to unless orders should as far as possible be tailored to the prejudice which would be suffered should there be non-compliance; and

> (c)     other means of penalising contumelious or persistent breaches are available, including but not limited to awarding costs on an indemnity basis and raising adverse inferences against the defaulting party at trial.

10     The most serious sanction of striking out a litigant’s claim or defence in its entirety should not be the default consequence of an unless order as it would effectively deprive the litigant of its substantive rights on account of its procedural fault (_Mitora_ at \[46\]). In considering whether such a sanction should be granted, the court is entitled to look at all circumstances (_Mitora_ at \[48\]).

### Present facts

11     While it could be said that this was the 2nd defendant’s first breach of the Court Order, I accepted the plaintiff’s submission that that in itself was not a bar to the granting of an unless order in the terms sought herein. The Court must examine the facts in each case and determine whether the sanction to be imposed is appropriate and justified in all the circumstances of the case.

12     In my judgment, the 2nd defendant’s default was inexcusable and it warranted the imposition of an unless order with the consequence of striking out. Based on the evidence before me, I was not satisfied that the 2nd defendant had made any serious efforts to comply nor shown any evidence of conscientious effort to prepare her AEIC or to take steps to explore possible solutions to her perceived obstacles.

13     The 2nd defendant’s breach in this case was, in my view, a breach of a significant procedural obligation. Unless the 2nd defendant files and exchanges her AEIC with the plaintiff, the plaintiff is effectively prevented from proceeding to trial. Although it was her first breach, it was undisputed that she had been in continuous breach of the Court Order since 19 October 2020 and did not seek any extension of time to file her AEIC in the interim period of nearly 3 months despite making express representations to the contrary.

14     Importantly, in this day and age of technology, it was simply not open to the 2nd defendant to claim that it was “challenging”[^4] for her to give meaningful instructions to her solicitors just because she was located in another country.

15     There were plain and obvious solutions for the 2nd defendant to access or retrieve her documents in Singapore, but she never attempted any of them on the evidence before me. To my mind, and as the plaintiff had sensibly submitted, these included instructing her solicitors to go to her Singapore residence to retrieve the documents, or getting on a video-call with her helper who resides in her Singapore home to go through the documents visually. Before me, there was also no evidence from the 2nd defendant as to why these options would not work. In view of the fact that she was represented by Singapore-based lawyers, and that there was another person residing in her Singapore residence where the documents were located, I found it unreasonable for the 2nd defendant to take the position that the only way for her to access or retrieve the documents was to personally fly back to Singapore and set foot in her Singapore residence.

16     Some of the documents which the 2nd defendant claimed she required to prepare her AEIC were bank statements and company documents. The plaintiff highlighted that the 2nd defendant could have written to the banks for the financial records or to the company secretary for the documents.[^5] I considered these to be reasonable steps for the 2nd defendant to take, if she was serious about “doing everything in \[her\] power”[^6] to comply with the Court Order. However, no evidence was adduced to show that the 2nd defendant had attempted any of these options, why they would not work, or whether she had even considered any of them.

17     If the 2nd defendant was serious about respecting the Court Order or did not want to intentionally breach it, she could have filed a summons for extension of time. In my view, she has had ample time to do so through her lawyers in Singapore. Further, this option was expressly mentioned in the correspondence exchanged between the parties’ respective solicitors as exhibited in the plaintiff’s affidavit.[^7] In the absence of any explanation from the 2nd defendant, I found it inexplicable why this course was not eventually taken.

18     I was also unable to agree with the 2nd defendant that without the documents in Singapore, she would be unable to draft her AEIC and would be denied her prerogative to rely on evidence which she deemed crucial to the determination of the dispute.[^8] The 2nd defendant did not provide any explanation for why she could not depose in her AEIC, the contents, description or gist of the relevant documents or the points that she wanted to make based on them, first. Based on the contents of her affidavit filed in the present application,[^9] she was clearly able to do so. It was open to her to make an application to adduce further evidence at a later stage, when she can retrieve the actual documents. In the circumstances, I did not find the 2nd defendant’s submissions on the prejudice suffered by her to be compelling; the situation was not as though she would be totally incapable of producing or relying on the evidence in question in any form.

19     I also had doubts about the _bona fides_ of the 2nd defendant’s submission that her default was unintentional or unforeseen due to extraneous circumstances. I considered it significant that the Court Order was granted by consent, _while the 2nd defendant was already physically in China_. If it was true that she was unable to obtain the necessary documents to prepare her AEIC while being located in China, it would not have made sense for her to have consented to the 19 October 2020 timeline in the Court Order. Again, no explanation was provided by the 2nd defendant for this.

20     The 2nd defendant also failed to provide the court with any evidence of her attempts to return to Singapore as soon as possible, such as air tickets or any communication made with the Singapore embassy in China or the relevant authorities for appeals, etc. All this court has before it, is the 2nd defendant’s bare assertion that she is trying her best to return to Singapore. I was also informed by the 2nd defendant’s counsel that the 2nd defendant was still facing certain obstacles which prevented her return to Singapore. Although that information could constitute evidence from the bar, I saw no reason to disbelieve it given that it was a matter within the 2nd defendant’s counsel’s personal knowledge as one of the solicitors on record having conduct of the matter and the plaintiff did not challenge it. In the circumstances, I was not convinced that the 2nd defendant’s assurances given to this court were fully genuine.

21     The Court Order was made on 23 September 2020. Even if it was true that the 2nd defendant had informed the plaintiff of her immigration difficulties in November 2020 as she claimed,[^10] the fact was that this circumstance had persisted for at least 2 months during which neither the 2nd defendant nor her lawyers made any progress or offered any alternative solutions to the plaintiff apart from having the 2nd defendant return physically to Singapore (and even for that, the 2nd defendant made no commitments to any dates). In my view, the 2nd defendant had enough time to find alternative solutions and it was unjust to keep the plaintiff waiting indefinitely. The legal proceedings had taken more than 3 years and directions for the exchange of AEICs were given from as early as in March 2020.

22     The parties also appeared before me for a hearing of the present application on 22 December 2020. I adjourned that hearing for the 2nd defendant to file a response affidavit. That would have given the 2nd defendant more time to think of possible solutions as well. However, from then until the substantive hearing of the application before me on 15 January 2021, it appeared that the 2nd defendant made no substantive progress in altering the status quo and continued to rely on the same excuse of not being able to physically return to Singapore, which, for the reasons explained above, failed to justify why she could not prepare and exchange her AEIC.

23     Overall, the 2nd defendant’s conduct gave me no confidence that she would take her AEIC preparation obligation seriously and pursue her defence in a proper manner, without unnecessary delay. There was no reason why these proceedings should be effectively held in abeyance without any sight of finality or resolution, when it was clear that the alleged difficulties faced by the 2nd defendant were not insurmountable. In my judgment, allowing the current status quo to persist would pose a real risk to securing a fair trial in accordance with due process of law.

24     To borrow the words of Auld LJ in _Hytec Information Systems v Coventry City Council_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 WLR 1666</span> at 1674 – 1675, which was cited with approval in _Mitora_ at \[42\], I was of the view that the present case is precisely one where “\[t\]he interests of justice require that justice be shown to the injured party for the procedural inefficiencies caused by the twin scourges of delay and wasted costs. The public interest in the administration of justice to contain those two blights upon it also weighs very heavily. Any injustice to the defaulting party, though never to be ignored, comes a long way behind the other two”.

## Conclusion

25     For the reasons stated above, I concluded that it was just for the balance to be struck in the plaintiff’s favour in this application. Taking all the circumstances of this case into account, I found it appropriate to impose the sanction of striking out. The plaintiff would suffer serious prejudice due to the 2nd defendant’s continued default on a significant procedural obligation without acceptable reason. I agreed with the plaintiff that costs may not be adequate to compensate for the prejudice that it would suffer, as the delay in this case was one with no apparent end in sight.

26     However, I considered that requiring the 2nd defendant to file her AEIC within 7 days of the order made herein as sought by the plaintiff, may provide rather short notice to the 2nd defendant. Balancing this with the fact that the 2nd defendant was notified of her obligation to file her AEIC from as early as March 2020 (counting from the date of the first order made for the exchange of the parties’ AEICs) or September 2020 (counting from the date of the Court Order), I granted an unless order with a 14-day time period for compliance, and awarded costs to the plaintiff for this application.

27     In order to move the matter along, I also granted an extension of time in respect of the ancillary timelines with adjustments made to take into account the 14-day time frame given as stated above.
