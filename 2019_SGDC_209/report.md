### District Judge Sheik Umar Bin Mohamed Bagushair:

1       In DC/SUM 2674/2019, the Plaintiff sought the following interlocutory reliefs against the Defendant:

> (a)     An order that the Defendant, whether acting by himself, his affiliates, servants and/or agents, and/or any entities in which he has an interest in, be restrained from doing the following acts or any of them:

>> (i)       Engaging in any action whatsoever and how so ever which may interfere, prejudice, or be contrary to the Plaintiff’s rights and/or interests as the owner of the Login Details;

>> (ii)       Engaging in any action whatsoever and how so ever which may injure, sabotage, interfere with, prejudice and/or be contrary to the Plaintiff’s business, interests and/or rights; and

>> (iii)       Enabling, assisting, causing, procuring or authorizing others to do any of the acts aforesaid,

> (b)     An order that the Defendant is to deliver up the Login Details within 7 days;

> (c)     An order that the Defendant, whether acting by himself, his affiliates, servants and/or agents, and/or any entities in which he has an interest in, from carrying out the acts set out in prayer 1 above up till the final disposal of the hearing of the Plaintiff’s present Summons for Injunction application (including any appeal thereto).

2       The Login Details are defined as the login details to four accounts which the Plaintiff says belongs to it, namely:

> (a)     the Instagram account @saltmagzine.asia;

> (b)     the registrar account in respect of the Plaintiff’s web domain, http://saltmagazine.asia;

> (c)     the email account clmedia@outlook.com; and

> (d)     PayPal account.

I will refer to these accounts collectively as the “**Accounts**”. It is the Plaintiff’s case that it owns the Accounts and that it needs the Login Details to the Accounts for its business, and that the Defendant has wrongfully retained the Login Details.

3       On 4 September 2019, I allowed the application in part, issued brief grounds and made the following orders:

> On the Plaintiff’s usual undertaking as to damages, which can be satisfied by paying into Court the sum of $5,000 or the provision of a solicitors’ undertaking for the same amount:

> (a)     The Defendant, whether acting by himself, servants and/or agents, be restrained from doing the following acts or any of them:

>> (i)       Engaging in any action whatsoever and howsoever which interferes with, prejudices, or is contrary to the Plaintiff’s interest in the Login Details.

> (b)     An order that the Defendant is to deliver up the Login Details within 7 days.

> (c)     Costs in the cause.

> (d)     Liberty to apply.

4       Both parties have appealed against my decision.

## Background

5       The Plaintiff was incorporated on 8 February 2017 for the purposes of publishing a gourmet magazine, ultimately called “SALT Magazine” (the “**Magazine**”). The Magazine was the brainchild of one Mr. Loh Liang Yee (“**Mr. Loh**”) who was at all times the sole director of the Plaintiff. The Magazine was the Plaintiff’s sole revenue-generating product. The Magazine consists of a print platform and an online platform, though the Plaintiff says that its focus is on the online platform and that it primarily targets the digital and online audience. The Plaintiff also says that the main bulk of its revenue comes from its advertising and events management / public relations services.

6       The Defendant was involved with the Plaintiff from its incorporation, beginning with an investment of $40,000 in the Plaintiff for a 10% shareholding. The Defendant had assisted the Plaintiff with administration issues, as well as in sourcing for loans and funding. The Plaintiff says that it created its digital presence (in the form of its website or social media accounts) with the help of third parties such as one Ms. Li Cheng and Mr. Jun Xian of Four Media, but that the Defendant was not involved in this process. However, the Plaintiff acknowledges that after the website and social media accounts were set up, the Defendant became involved in the Plaintiff’s business as its “ad-hoc IT administrator.” Curiously, the Defendant did not enter into an employment agreement with the Plaintiff, and he did not receive a salary. Nevertheless, it would appear that the Defendant agreed to be the ad-hoc IT administrator in conjunction with his investment into the Plaintiff. The Defendant’s responsibilities as ad-hoc IT administrator also grew over time. After February 2018, the Defendant more or less had control over the Plaintiff’s social media accounts, and after September 2018 he had control over the Plaintiff’s registrar account for its domain.

7       The relationship between the parties started falling apart after January 2019 onwards. The source of the unhappiness was unpaid loans that the Defendant had made to the Plaintiff. At that time, the Plaintiff had not yet made a profit, was not doing well financially and badly needed an investor. Sometime in May 2019, the Plaintiff entered into a sale and purchase agreement (“**SPA**”) with Candid @ Media Pte Ltd (“**Candid**”) providing for the sale of the Magazine business (which consisted of the print and online platform) to Candid for $28,000. The effect of the SPA was hotly contested by both parties. The Defendant argued that the SPA was a critical piece of evidence establishing that the whole Magazine had in fact been sold and that the Plaintiff therefore had no _locus_ to even seek an injunction. The Plaintiff disputed this. This seemed to be a preliminary issue which the Plaintiff had to overcome and I will return to this later.

8       The parties’ relationship deteriorated further after the SPA. The Plaintiff brought forth evidence of the Defendant abusing his access to the Login Details to sabotage the Plaintiff’s business – for example, by deleting all of the posts on the Plaintiff’s Instagram account and by disabling access to the Plaintiff’s web domain. The Plaintiff accused the Defendant of changing all the Login Details thereby denying the Plaintiff access to all of the Accounts. The Defendant too made serious allegations against Mr. Loh of various financial misdeeds he committed in his capacity as director the Plaintiff.

9       The Plaintiff filed this application essentially to compel the Defendant to return the Login Details and to prevent the Defendant from committing further acts that may prejudice the Plaintiff’s business. Although the application was initially filed _ex parte_ (and without notice), the Court directed the Plaintiff to serve the application on the Defendant. The matter thereby proceeded on an _inter partes_ basis, with both parties filing affidavits and written submissions.

10     There were 4 issues for me to resolve:

> (a)     Whether the Plaintiff had transferred the Magazine to Candid, and if so, whether the Plaintiff had standing to seek the injunction;

> (b)     Whether the Plaintiff established a serious issue to be tried in respect of its causes of action against the Defendant;

> (c)     Should the injunction be refused, whether the Plaintiff’s loss can be compensated in damages;

> (d)     Whether the balance of convenience lay in granting or refusing the injunction.

## The law on interim injunctions

11     The parties did not dispute that the _American Cyanamid_ principles applied. The Plaintiff therefore had to establish a serious issue to be tried and that the balance of convenience lay in its favour in granting an injunction (_Challenger Technologies Ltd v Courts (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 679</span> at \[13\] (“_Challenger Technologies_”)). An important consideration in the balance of convenience is the adequacy of damages.

12     A serious question to be tried is established when the Court is satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious. This is a low threshold and the prospects of the plaintiff’s success are to be investigated only to a limited extent (_Challenger Technologies_ at \[15\]-\[17\]).

13     As the prayer seeking a delivery up of the Login Details was a mandatory injunction, an issue arose as to whether the test for granting such an injunction was any different. As a starting point, the fundamental principle to bear in mind in an injunction application is that the Court “_should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been wrong at trial in the sense of granting relief to a party who fails to establish his rights at the trial, or of failing to grant relief to a party who succeeds at the trial_” (_Chuan Hong Petrol Station v Shell Singapore (Pte) Ltd_ \[1992\] SLR(R) 1 at \[88\] (“_Shell Singapore_”)). Whilst this fundamental principle also applies where a mandatory injunction is being sought (_Shell Singapore_ at \[88\]), given that such an injunction “_is a more invasive remedy and…may lead to irreversible prejudice to a defendant…\[a\] court must therefore be sure…that the grant of the interim mandatory injunction is indeed the course of action which carries the lower risk of injustice – in other words, that the prejudice to the applicant from not granting the interim mandatory injunction outweighs that to the defendant from granting it_” (_RGA Holdings International Inc v Loh Choon Phing Robin and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 997</span> at \[31\] (“_RGA Holdings_”)).

14     The Plaintiff’s prayer for the delivery up of the Login Details was a mandatory injunction and arguably a higher threshold had to be met. However, the reason _why_ a higher threshold is required is tied to the fact that a mandatory injunction is ordinarily invasive and can cause irreversible prejudice to the defendant. Where the grant of the mandatory injunction is neither invasive nor results in irreversible prejudice, I am not sure that a higher threshold had to be met before the injunction was granted. I will return to this point later.

## Whether the Plaintiff had standing to seek the injunction

15     The Defendant forcefully argued that the Magazine had been sold by the Plaintiff to Candid and therefore the Plaintiff has no standing to seek an injunction in relation to the Login Details. Instead, the right party to seek the injunction is Candid. The Defendant relied on the following points:

> (a)     The SPA provided for the sale of the Plaintiff’s business that included the Magazine. The assets to be transferred included the Magazine’s domain and various social media accounts (including its Instagram account). The Defendant points out that the condition precedents in the agreement do not include the transfer of the domain and social media accounts and therefore on the face of the SPA, the Magazine and its ancillary assets had been transferred to Candid.

> (b)     The Plaintiff’s address is #06-10 Sim Lim Square. Sometime in May or June 2019, the signage of the office was replaced. Now the office signage lists both “Candid” and “SALT,” suggesting that the Magazine now belonged to Candid.

16     The Plaintiff denied that it lacked standing, and made the following points:

> (a)     The parties intended for the sale of the Magazine to be completed _after_ the transfer of all of the Magazine’s assets which included the Accounts. Since the Plaintiff did not have access to the Login Details, the Accounts could not be transferred and the sale was not completed. Therefore, the Magazine has not been transferred to Candid. The Plaintiff says that the SPA was drafted by laypersons, and not lawyers, and therefore their failure to specify that the transfer of the Accounts was a condition precedent to the sale should not be taken against them.

> (b)     As for the change in the signage, the Plaintiff explained that after the proposed sale of the Magazine, the Plaintiff and Candid also entered into a side agreement whereby (amongst other things) the Plaintiff would receive a monthly retainer and commission for work done as Candid’s agent and media representative.

> (c)     In any event, even if there was a transfer of the Magazine, it was only a partial transfer, restricted to the print platform. Other assets linked to the Magazine, such as the Accounts, could not have been transferred since the Plaintiff did not possess the Login Details.

17     Considering the evidence and bearing in mind that the Plaintiff’s burden at this stage was only to establish a serious issue to be tried, I was of the view that the Accounts, which were assets that were to be transferred pursuant to the SPA, remained with the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff was therefore the proper party to seek injunctive relief in relation to the Login Details. I came to that view for the following reasons:

> (a)     Although the transfer of the Accounts was not a condition precedent under the SPA, the Plaintiff could not have transferred the Accounts to Candid since it did not possess the Login Details. It was an obligation the Plaintiff could not have discharged. I accepted the Plaintiff’s evidence that the parties to the SPA did not consider that the sale was completed and had acted on that basis.

> (b)     In relation to the change in the Plaintiff’s signage I thought that this evidence was neutral at best, and is also consistent with the Plaintiff’s position that it had entered into a side agreement whereby (amongst other things) it would receive a monthly retainer and commission for work done as Candid’s agent and media representative.

> (c)     In the latest issue of the Magazine, which was not put in evidence but which I was able to access, the publisher was listed as Candid. In the issue before that, which was published around April 2019, the publisher was listed as the Plaintiff. This strongly suggested that at the very least the Magazine’s print platform had been transferred to Candid. Notwithstanding this, I remain of the view that the Accounts remained with the Plaintiff simply because it was not in a position to effectuate the transfer of the Accounts without the Login Details.

18     There is therefore no _locus_ issue, at least in relation to the Login Details. However, because the evidence suggests that part of the Plaintiff’s business has been transferred to Candid, this affected some of the other reliefs the Plaintiff was seeking.

## Whether there was a serious issue to be tried

19     The Plaintiff pursues two causes of action against the Defendant – breach of fiduciary duty and in the tort of detinue. Although no employment agreement existed between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, it is the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant nevertheless owed fiduciary duties to the Plaintiff as a result of the relationship of trust and confidence that existed between the parties. The Plaintiff says that the relationship of trust and confidence is obvious from the Defendant’s involvement in the Plaintiff’s business and in particular in the IT aspects, his control over the registrar account of the Plaintiff’s domain and control over its social media accounts, his access to information about the Plaintiff’s business, and his access to the Plaintiff’s bank account details. The Defendant did not dispute that he had this access. The Plaintiff emphasizes that because the Magazine relies heavily on its digital platform, the person who has access to the various aspects of the digital platform (the website and social media accounts) is in a position to disrupt the Plaintiff’s business thereby rendering the Plaintiff in a vulnerable position. The Plaintiff relies on this vulnerability to argue that as a result, the Defendant owed fiduciary duties to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff says that the Defendant had breached his fiduciary duties by (amongst other things) failing to deliver up the Login Details and committing various acts of sabotage to the Plaintiff’s website and Instagram account.

20     In the alternative, the Plaintiff argued that it had a claim in detinue against the Defendant in respect of the Login Details. The Plaintiff relied on various emails and WhatsApp communications to establish that it owned the Accounts that could be only be accessed through the Login Details.

21     The Plaintiff argued that the injunction should be granted because it had established a serious issue to be tried in relation to these two asserted causes of action, and that the balance of convenience titled in favour of granting the injunction. In particular, the Plaintiff asserted that its losses cannot be adequately compensated by damages – relying on the fact that the Plaintiff’s business may be destroyed entirely if the Login Details were not delivered up, and the Plaintiff’s loss of commercial reputation and goodwill.

22     The Defendant’s counsel Ms. Mimi Oh did not focus her arguments on the viability of these two causes of action, save to reiterate that the Instagram account and the registrar account (in respect of the Plaintiff’s web domain) belonged to the Defendant. Instead, Ms. Oh focused her arguments on the preliminary issue of standing.

### Whether a fiduciary relationship arose

23     In _Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and ors v Yeo Boong Hua and ors and anor appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 655</span> (“_Turf Club_”) at \[42\], the Court of Appeal discussed when a fiduciary relationship may arise. At \[43\] of _Turf Club_, the Court of Appeal concluded as follows:

> While there are settled categories of fiduciary relationships – such as the relationship of a trustee-beneficiary, director-company, solicitor-client, between partners – it does not mean that all such relationships _are_ invariably fiduciary relationships. In these relationships, there is a strong, but rebuttable, presumption that fiduciary duties are owed. Equally, the categories of fiduciary relationships are not closed or limited only to the settled categories. Fiduciary duties may be owed even if the relationship between the parties is not one of the settled categories, provided that the circumstances justify the imposition of such duties (see _Snell’s Equity_ at paras 7-004–7-005). For instance, parties in a joint venture may or may not share a fiduciary relationship, depending on the circumstances of their relationship (see John Glower, _Commercial Equity – Fiduciary Relationships_ (Butterworths, 1995) at paras 3.90–3.96 and _Snell’s Equity_ at para 7-006). Therefore, contrary to the approaches adopted by the parties (in particular the Respondents), whether the parties are in a fiduciary relationship depends, ultimately, on the nature of their relationship and is not simply a question of whether their relationship can be shoe-horned into one of the settled categories (_eg_, a partnership) or into a non-settled category (_eg_, a joint venture or quasi-partnership).

24     What characteristics are common to fiduciary relationships? The Court of Appeal in _Susilawati v American Express Bank Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 737</span> at \[41\] (“_Susilawati_”) considered, _obiter_, that relationships in which fiduciary obligations have been imposed seem to possess three general characteristics:

> (a)     The fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some discretion or power.

> (b)     The fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power or discretion so as to affect the beneficiary’s legal or practical interests.

> (c)     The beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the fiduciary holding the discretion or power.

25     I concluded that there existed a fiduciary relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, _but only in relation to the Defendant’s possession and use of the Login Details._ In other words, the fiduciary relationship was not an all-encompassing one that could potentially affect all of the Defendant’s actions. Whilst imposing a fiduciary relationship in respect of certain assets is somewhat unusual, there is nothing at law that prohibits this. Neither is it uncommon. For example, the fiduciary relationship between a client and the property agent he engaged to sell his house (see e.g., _Yuen Chow Hin and anor v ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 786</span> at \[13\]) is linked to the house. It would not be a breach of those fiduciary duties if, for example, the property agent entered into a business that competed with the client’s business. In that way, the fiduciary relationship does not touch all of the property agent’s actions, but only those actions that related to the house. Similarly, the fiduciary relationship between a sale committee and the subsidiary proprietors in relation to an intended collective sale (see e.g., _Ng Eng Ghee and ors v Mamata Kapildev Dave and ors (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intevener) and anor appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 109</span>) would be linked to the properties belonging to the subsidiary proprietors.

26     My reasons for concluding that there existed a fiduciary relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, _but only in relation to the Defendant’s possession and use of the Login Details_, are:

> (a)     The Accounts (and in particular the Instagram account and web domain) were an important part of the Magazine, whether in terms of branding or advertising. This point was reiterated several times in the Plaintiff’s affidavits and was not disputed by the Defendant. The Login Details provided access to those Accounts.

> (b)     The Accounts belonged to the Plaintiff. I am satisfied that the Plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to show that it is the owner of the Accounts, and therefore entitled to the Login Details of these Accounts. The Defendant in his affidavits does not dispute the Plaintiff’s ownership of the PayPal account or the email account. In relation to both the domain registrar account and the Instagram account, even though the Defendant insisted that they belonged to him, no supporting evidence was provided, save for an email sent on 28 May 2019 confirming the change in the domain registrant’s details, to support his position that he was the owner of the domain. But the document on the contrary confirms that before 28 May 2019, the owner on record was the Plaintiff, with the Defendant _being the contact person_. This confirms the Plaintiff’s position that the Defendant was in control of the Login Details, including the domain registrar account.

> (c)     The domain registrar account and Instagram account was at all times used solely for the Plaintiff’s benefit and in particular for the branding and advertising of the Magazine. There is no evidence that the Defendant had ever used these accounts for his personal benefit.

> (d)     The Defendant had full control of the Accounts, through the Login Details. This is not disputed by the Defendant and is consistent with his position that the Instagram account and the domain registrar account belonged to him. Furthermore, the Defendant had the ability to change the Login Details at will, and when he did so he would only share the Login Details to the Plaintiff’s staff when requested. Of course, once the parties’ relationships fell apart, the Defendant no longer shared the Login Details with the Plaintiff, effectively locking the Plaintiff out of the Accounts.

27     In my view, the Defendant’s control over the Accounts through his retention of Login Details contained all three characteristics identified by the Court of Appeal in _Susilawati_ as characteristics common to a fiduciary relationship. He had significant discretion or power over his access to the Accounts, he could (and in fact did) unilaterally exercise his power or discretion over the Accounts to affect the Plaintiff’s interests, and the Plaintiff was peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the Defendant’s control over the Accounts.

28     The Plaintiff forcefully argued that it was in a particularly vulnerable position in relation to the Defendant’s control of the Accounts through the retention of the Login Details. I agree. This vulnerability was exposed when the Defendant refused to hand over the Login Details and exercised the control he had over the Login Details to disable access to the domain name and Instagram account. In those circumstances, I consider that a fiduciary relationship existed between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, _but only in relation to the Defendant’s possession and use of the Login Details._

29     Although the Plaintiff’s counsel Mr. Nevinjit Singh submitted that the fiduciary relationship between the Plaintiff and Defendant was “all-encompassing” and therefore not necessarily limited to the Login Details, I declined to make such a finding.

30     I therefore find that the Plaintiff has established a serious issue to be tried in relation to the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in respect of the Defendant’s possession and use of the Login Details. This meant (amongst other things) that the Defendant needed to use the Login Details for the Plaintiff’s benefit. He has not done so – after all, he has effectively shut down the Instagram account and the domain name and denied the Plaintiff access to the Accounts.

31     I therefore need not consider whether there is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the Plaintiff’s detinue claim. However, if I am wrong on the issue of the existence of the fiduciary relationship, I also find that the Plaintiff has established a serious issue to be tried in relation to the claim in detinue that entitled the Plaintiff to seek a delivery up of the Login Details. Again, I consider that the Plaintiff has sufficiently established that it is the owner of the Accounts and therefore entitled to the delivery up of the Login Details.

## Adequacy of damages

32     Given that the Plaintiff has established the first stage of the _American Cyanamid_ test, I consider the balance of convenience, the most important aspect of which is the adequacy of damages.

33     I observe that the Defendant has not addressed the issue of adequacy of damages at all, whether in his affidavits or submissions. This suggests that he accepts the Plaintiff’s position, as set out in its affidavits, that damages are not an adequate remedy. Even if that were not to be the case, for the following reasons, I find that the Plaintiff has established that damages are not an adequate remedy:

> (a)     If the Plaintiff does not gain access to the Accounts, the Magazine might need to shut down, which would lead to the Plaintiff being insolvent. I accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that its business has been severely affected by the loss of its access to the Accounts. In _Gatekeeper, Inc v Wang Wensheng (trading as Hawkeye Techologies)_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 239</span> (“_Gatekeeper_”), a decision relied on by the Plaintiff, the Court considered that the fact that the business might be destroyed if no injunction was granted was a factor which made damages inadequate as a remedy (_Gatekeeper_ at \[6\]).

> (b)     I also accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that its commercial reputation and goodwill in the market has suffered. The Plaintiff in particular relies on the after-effects of an incident on 4 July 2019 to establish this loss. On that day, the Defendant had engaged debt collectors who appeared at the Plaintiff’s office and who (according to the Plaintiff) harassed the Plaintiff’s staff. The Defendant was also present and in fact live-streamed parts of this encounter to the Plaintiff’s Instagram account. News of this spread rapidly, largely because of an article reporting on this accident on MustShareNews.com. The Plaintiff tendered evidence showing that several of its clients paused or terminated their relationships with the Plaintiff after this incident. In _Gatekeeper_ at \[6\], the loss of commercial reputation and goodwill was considered a loss that could not be adequately compensated by an award of damages.

> (c)     The content on the Plaintiff’s web domain and Instagram account cannot be replicated. This loss in content was also a factor which made damages inadequate as a remedy.

34     I considered that the above losses brought about by the Plaintiff’s deprivation of the Accounts could not be adequately compensated by an award of damages.

35     Conversely, if the interlocutory relief was wrongly granted, and at the end of trial, the Court holds that the Accounts belonged to the Defendant, the loss to the Defendant resulting from the deprivation of the Accounts can be adequately compensated by an award of damages. In fact, I am not even sure that the Defendant’s loss of access to the Accounts and Login Details would result in _any_ losses given that the Defendant has effectively disabled the Instagram account and the domain name and is not using them for his personal use or for any other use.

## Balance of convenience

36     The balance of convenience did not lay in favour of the Defendant. On the contrary, the balance of convenience heavily favoured the Plaintiff. The Login Details are for Accounts that had previously been used by the Plaintiff and for the Magazine. There is no evidence that the Defendant is using any of the Accounts for his own benefit, and if the Login Details are delivered up to the Plaintiff, there is no evidence that he would be deprived of anything, except perhaps as a bargaining tool in his dispute with the Plaintiff and Mr. Loh.

37     I should state that in granting Prayer 2 (i.e., for the Defendant to deliver up the Login Details), which is a mandatory injunction, I am mindful that the law requires that the Court be satisfied of something more than if a prohibitive injunction had been granted. Usually, a “clear case” or “a high degree of assurance” is required before granting the mandatory injunction. However, this requirement arises because a mandatory injunction would ordinarily be invasive and can cause irreversible prejudice to the defendant. That is not the case here. The order for the delivery up of the Login Details is neither invasive nor irreversible. In any event, as the Court of Appeal explained in _RGA Holdings_, ultimately, the Court must pursue the course of action that “_carries the lower risk of injustice_”. I am of the view that the orders I have made carries the lower risk of injustice. I take into account the fact that the Login Details are in respect of Accounts owned by the Plaintiff and which are not being used by the Defendant and have no value to the Defendant whatsoever (apart from its value as a potential bargaining tool in his dispute with the Plaintiff and Mr. Loh). In light of that, I consider that the prejudice to the Plaintiff from not granting the injunction outweighs that to the Defendant from granting it.

38     On the issue of the undertaking as to damages, there is some evidence that the Plaintiff is impecunious and therefore its undertaking as to damages may not have utility. Consequently, I ordered that the injunction would only take effect on the Plaintiff satisfying the undertaking by paying into Court the sum of $5,000 or by providing a solicitor’s undertaking for the same amount. I concluded that at this stage, the sum of $5,000 was sufficient given that I was not able to discern any loss that the Defendant might suffer should the injunction be found to have been wrongly granted. As I had pointed out earlier, the Defendant is not using the domain name or the Instagram account and has effectively shut them down.

## Other Prayers

39     The Plaintiff has also appealed against my decision as I only allowed some but not all of its prayers.

40     The Plaintiff’s Prayer 1 sought “_\[a\]n order that the Defendant, whether acting by himself, his affiliates, servants and/or agents, and/or any entities in which he has an interest in, be restrained from doing the following acts or any of them…”_ I was only prepared to grant an order that “_\[t\]he Defendant, whether acting by himself, servants and/or agents, be restrained from doing the following acts or any of them_…” I was not persuaded that the order should extend to the Defendant’s “_affiliates_” and “_any entities in which he has an interest in_.” Firstly, I am not sure how affiliates can apply to a person rather than a corporation. Secondly, I did not think the injunction should bind entities which the Defendant had an interest in, no matter how small the interest.

41     In Prayer 1(a), the Plaintiff sought an order that the Defendant be restrained from “_\[e\]ngaging in any action whatsoever and how so ever which may interfere, prejudice, or be contrary to the Plaintiff’s rights and/or interests as the owner of the Login Details_.” I was only prepared to grant an order that the Defendant be restrained from “_\[e\]ngaging in any action whatsoever and howsoever which interferes with, prejudices, or is contrary to the Plaintiff’s interest in the Login Details_.” I considered that the order I made still protected the Plaintiff’s interest in the Login Details.

42     In Prayer 1(b), the Plaintiff sought an order that the Defendant be restrained from “_\[e\]ngaging in any action whatsoever and how so ever which may injure, sabotage, interfere with, prejudice and/or be contrary to the Plaintiff’s business, interests and/or rights_.” I declined to grant this prayer, which was to protect the Plaintiff’s “_business, interests and/or rights_.” Since it appears that the Magazine’s print platform had been transferred to Candid, I was not sure of the present scope of the Plaintiff’s business. Furthermore, I have found that a fiduciary relationship existed between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, but only in relation to the Defendant’s possession and use of the Login Details. As such, I was not prepared to grant Prayer 1(b) as that injunction went beyond the Login Details.

43     In Prayer 1(c), the Plaintiff sought an order that the Defendant be restrained from “_\[e\]nabling, assisting, causing, procuring or authorizing others to do any of the acts aforesaid_.” I declined to grant this prayer. The Plaintiff’s obligation to comply with the injunction would necessarily extend to refraining from procuring third parties to breach the injunction. This prayer was therefore unnecessary.

44     Finally, in Prayer 3, the Plaintiff sought “_\[a\]n order that the Defendant, whether acting by himself, his affiliates, servants and/or agents, and/or any entities in which he has an interest in, from carrying out the acts set out in prayer 1 above up till the final disposal of the hearing of the Plaintiff’s present Summons for Injunction application (including any appeal thereto).”_ I declined to grant this prayer. It seemed to me that this was an interim order that would kick in if I had dismissed Prayers 1 and 2. Since I granted Prayers 1(a) and 2, I did not consider Prayer 3 to be necessary. In any event, if the Plaintiff wanted interim orders pending an appeal, it should have made an application separately. No such application was made after I delivered my decision.

## Conclusion

45     For the reasons set out above, I therefore granted the Plaintiff’s application in part, as set out at \[3\] above.

## Post-script

46     After I delivered my decision, the Defendant filed an appeal and applied to stay my decision. The Plaintiff argued that without a stay, the appeal would be rendered nugatory because the Plaintiff, after receiving the Login Details, would transfer the Accounts to Candid (pursuant to the SPA). If the appeal is allowed, the Login Details would have to be returned to the Defendant but if the Accounts have been transferred to Candid, the Plaintiff would not be able to do so. I agreed with this assessment. I proposed to the Plaintiff that Mr. Loh (the Plaintiff’s sole director) and the Plaintiff undertake to the Court that pending the resolution of the Defendant’s appeal, the Plaintiff will not transfer the Login Details to any third party or take any other steps which will prevent the Plaintiff from transferring the Login Details to the Defendant should the appeal be successful. Ms. Oh confirmed that if such an undertaking was provided, she would not pursue the stay application. After Mr. Singh confirmed that the Plaintiff and Mr. Loh agreed to the undertaking, I granted no order on the Defendant’s stay application.
