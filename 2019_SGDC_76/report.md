Civil Procedure – Striking Out

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in RAS 8/2019.\]

10 May 2019

### District Judge James Leong Kiu Yiu:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff is the Management Corporation of an industrial building. The Defendant is a property management company. The Defendant applied by way of Summons No 4408 of 2018 to strike out the action on the ground that it was filed by the Plaintiff in direct breach of Section 6 of the Small Claims Tribunals Act (Cap 308) (“SCTA”). This was heard and dismissed by the Learned Deputy Registrar. The Defendant then filed Registrar’s Appeal No. 28 of 2019 which I heard and dismissed. The Defendant has since appealed against my decision to the High Court and I set out the grounds of my decision below.

## Background

2       By a contract dated 1 June 2016, the Plaintiff appointed the Defendant as their managing agents for a one year term at a monthly fee of $ 1500. Following a change in the composition of the Plaintiff’s Council, a letter dated 17 September 2018 was sent to the Defendant to terminate the contract. Dissatisfied with the termination, the Defendant lodged a claim on 31 October 2018 in the Small Claims Tribunals (“SCT”) for a declaration that the termination was wrong in law and sought damages (which they agreed to cap to come within the monetary jurisdiction of the SCT) for the remaining term of the contract.

3       On 19 November 2018, the Plaintiff filed their Defence/Response to the SCT claim. On the same day, they also filed the present action in the District Court in DC 3255 of 2018 seeking declarations and damages from the Defendant in contract and tort.

## Relevant Legal Principles & Provisions

4       The principles in relation to striking out are well established and were not disputed in this case. The Defendant’s application for striking out was instead premised on the purported breach of Section 6 of the SCTA (“s.6”). This provides that:

_“Exclusion of other jurisdictions_

_6.– (1_)     _Where a claim has been lodged with a tribunal, no proceedings relating to that claim shall be brought before any other court except –_

(_a_)     _where the proceedings before that court were commenced before the claim was lodged with the tribunal; or_

(_b_)     _where the claim before the tribunal has been withdrawn or abandoned._

(_2_)     _No claim shall be brought before a tribunal if proceedings relating to that claim are pending in or have been heard and determined by any other court._

(_3_)     _For purpose of this section, a claim shall be deemed to have been lodged with a tribunal when section 15 has been complied with.”_

## Key Issue for Determination

5       In essence, the outcome of the striking out application hinged on the interpretation of s. 6 of the SCTA. If the claim was found to be in breach of the statutory provision, then striking out was warranted. If it was not in breach, then the striking out would fail.

## Submissions of Parties

6       It was the Defendant’s submission that the legislative intent of s. 6 of the SCTA was to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the SCT once a SCT claim has been filed. This exclusive jurisdiction that extended to all other related claims was to be determined on a first come first served basis. As the two actions are related, the Defendant highlighted the risks of conflicting judicial decisions at the SCT and District Court to support their application for striking out.

7       While acknowledging that the Plaintiff could apply to move their claim to a different forum, it was submitted that they could not do so unilaterally. It was also submitted that the action of the Plaintiff in commencing the present District Court action was an attempt to forum shop to shut out the Defendant’s SCT claim. With no direct cases on point to support their interpretation of s. 6, the Defendant relied on the principles of statutory interpretation to support their submission.

8       It was the Plaintiff’s submission that the exclusion in s. 6 of the SCTA applied to the specific claim lodged with the SCT. It was further submitted that using a first come first served approach would give rise to prejudicial implications against the slower party. Highlighting that these were the only proceedings brought by them, it was explained that the District Court was the most appropriate forum to allow the Plaintiff adequate legal representation since it acted on behalf of the entire body of subsidiary proprietors. In this regard, it was submitted that the Defendant’s allegation of forum shopping was misguided.

## Analysis

9       Returning to the key issue for determination, I found myself in broad agreement with the finding of the Deputy Registrar that “… _On a proper construction of s 6 of the SCTA, I am of the view that s 6 precludes the multiplicity of proceedings relating to claims which have already been commenced before the SCT_.”

10     As I had indicated when dismissing the RA, notwithstanding that the claim at SCT and the present action both arose out of the same contract, they were separate and distinct claims to which s 6 had no application. In this regard, I agreed with the submissions of the Plaintiff that the Defendant’s interpretation of s 6 of the SCTA was misguided and flawed.

11     As submitted by the Plaintiff, it could not have been the intention of Parliament to confer unlimited, exclusive jurisdiction on the SCT for all related claims, particularly on a first come first served basis as contended by the Defendant. Considering the objective of the SCT as noted at page 6 of the Defendant’s written submission to provide “… _a quick and inexpensive forum to resolve small claims_”, as well as the statutory jurisdiction prescribed by s 5 of the SCTA, the submission of the Defendant that s 6 conferred unlimited, exclusive jurisdiction on the SCT over all related claims was clearly misconceived.

## Conclusion

12     In light of the above, as this was clearly not a plain and obvious case for striking out, the RA was dismissed with costs to the Plaintiff fixed at $ 1000 all in.
