Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases – General damages for pain and suffering – Whiplash

29 July 2019

### Deputy Registrar Lim Wen Juin:

1       This is an assessment of damages in a motor accident case. The plaintiff alleges that the accident caused him to suffer a whiplash injury classified as Grade 1 under the Quebec classification system and a contusion of his right wrist. He claims general damages for pain and suffering as well as special damages for medical and transport expenses incurred and loss of income. But the defendant denies that the plaintiff suffered any injury at all from the accident and so contends that the plaintiff should be awarded nothing.

2       At the time of the accident the plaintiff was 57 years old and working as a private-hire driver. There is no dispute about the way in which the accident happened. The plaintiff and the defendant were each at the wheel of stationary cars in a carpark around 9.20pm on 25 March 2017. The defendant’s car was several metres in front of the car driven by the plaintiff. The defendant reversed and eventually caused the rear of his car to collide with the front of the car driven by the plaintiff, which was stationary at the time. It is clear from the video footage shown to me at the assessment of damages hearing that the defendant’s car was reversing slowly. The video footage was recorded by a camera on board the car driven by the plaintiff and at the point of collision the displacement of the camera caused by the impact was very slight. I was also shown colour photographs of the car driven by the plaintiff taken in daylight the day after the accident and in them I could barely see any damage to the car. All this demonstrates that the collision was not at all a forceful one. It is from this gentle-seeming collision that the plaintiff claims to have suffered injury.

3       The plaintiff did not seek medical attention that night. He says that he felt slight discomfort in his neck and right wrist in the hours after the accident and thought he would recover after a night of sleep, but when he woke the following morning the pain was worse. He went to Mount Alvernia Hospital around 5.00pm that day (that is, 26 March 2017). This was about 19 hours after the accident. The medical report arising from this consultation states that the plaintiff’s injury “falls under the category of whiplash injury grade 1 and right wrist contusion caused by a road traffic accident”. The plaintiff was prescribed painkillers and given six days of outpatient medical leave. He did not seek any further medical attention in connection with the accident.

4       Under an interlocutory judgment entered by consent the defendant is to pay 90% of the damages assessed to be due to the plaintiff. The issue of causation of injuries was expressly reserved under the interlocutory judgment.

5       The basic difficulty that the defendant faces in mounting the argument that the accident caused the plaintiff no injury is that a medical doctor took a contrary view after having subjected the plaintiff to a physical examination. Dr Su Xiaoting was the doctor who examined him at Mount Alvernia Hospital and she gave evidence in court as the single joint expert in this case. The medical report stated that there was “tenderness elicited over the cervical paraspinal muscles”, and Dr Su explained that during the consultation on 26 March 2017 she touched the plaintiff’s neck at various points and he reported feeling pain at some of those points. Dr Su acknowledged during examination by counsel for the defendant Mr Richard Tan that it was possible that the plaintiff might have been untruthful in reporting his pain in an attempt to deceive her into diagnosing an injury that he did not have, but she added that this was unlikely because the plaintiff had been fairly specific about where the pain was and had not simply said that there was pain everywhere.

6       Dr Su was shown the video footage of the accident and asked by Mr Tan whether she would revise her opinion given that the defendant’s car had been reversing at low speed. Dr Su said that she would not. She said that she could not tell from the video footage alone how forceful the collision had been, and she further explained during examination by counsel for the plaintiff Mr Gopalakrishnan Dinagaran that, in any case, it was not uncommon to see whiplash injuries caused by “low-impact” collisions because the force of the collision is not the only factor that determines whether any injury is suffered. The personal characteristics of the individual involved in the collision also matter, and as Dr Su put it, “if the patient is more elderly, or deconditioned, they tend to suffer more repercussions than young, well-conditioned persons where their muscles are strong enough to withstand the impact energy”. Dr Su was also asked by Mr Tan whether the fact that the plaintiff did not feel pain immediately after the accident suggested that he had not in fact suffered any injury as a result of the accident, and her answer was unequivocally in the negative. She said that, on the contrary, it is “very typical” for people who have sustained whiplash injury not to feel pain at once and to feel it “only 24 hours later when they have had some rest”. Dr Su explained that this delay was due to the “mechanics” of a whiplash injury: what happens is that “there is a lot of destabilisation in the vertebra” as a result of the collision, and “what the body tries to do is to stabilise, and if the muscles are not strong they will spasm” and so “produce lactic acid”, which causes the feeling of ache. Dr Su added that a whiplash injury of this nature “is not bony injury or physical injury like trauma”.

7       On the strength of Dr Su’s logical and lucid evidence I am satisfied that it is possible for whiplash injury to be caused by a collision that does not involve a large amount of force, especially in the case of people of more advanced age, and that it is entirely possible and perhaps even normal for the pain from such an injury not to become manifest for several hours or even a day after the collision. These are matters on which Dr Su has specialised knowledge given her medical education and professional experience and I thus accord due weight to her opinions on those matters. But it is another question altogether whether the plaintiff was telling the truth when he reported his pain to Dr Su. Dr Su thought that he was but this is a question of fact that involves no point of “scientific, technical or otherwise specialised knowledge” such as is contemplated in s 47(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), and so I cannot assign any substantial weight to Dr Su’s opinion in this regard. I must instead determine that question by myself by assessing all the evidence.

8       The piece of evidence that generates greatest doubt as to whether the accident caused the plaintiff to suffer any injury at all is an accident statement dated 27 March 2017, 11.22pm. This was an accident statement lodged by Lion City Rentals Pte Ltd, the registered owner of the car driven by the plaintiff. The plaintiff confirmed during cross-examination that he signed the accident statement in the space above the words “Driver’s Signature”. The accident statement took the form of typewritten answers to a set of questions, and the material point is that the question “Was any body injured in the Accident?” was answered with a “No”. Given that this accident statement was made one day after the plaintiff’s consultation at Mount Alvernia Hospital, one would expect the question to have been answered in the affirmative. In re-examination the plaintiff explained that he did not understand English, that the accident statement had not been prepared by him, and that he had simply signed on it when asked to, but I find these explanations unsatisfactory. I cannot believe that the plaintiff’s proficiency in English is so poor that he cannot understand a question as basic as whether anyone was injured in the accident, and this is because, as Mr Tan pointed out, the plaintiff affirmed his affidavit of evidence-in-chief in English. And although I can accept that the plaintiff may not have prepared the accident statement himself it seems to me highly improbable that the person who prepared it would have answered “No” to that question without first having checked with him, and so it seems to me more likely than not that at some point during the preparation of the accident statement the plaintiff said that no one had been injured in the accident.

9       But that accident statement must be weighed against the police report that the plaintiff made on 26 March 2017 around 10.33pm. In this report he stated that after the accident he “went back home and felt pain on \[his\] neck and right wrist” and “went to see \[_sic_\] treatment at Mount Alvernia Hospital”. Thus the police report suggests that the accident did cause the plaintiff to suffer some sort of injury. It is also material that when the plaintiff described to Dr Su the circumstances of the accident he was fairly candid: according to Dr Su’s clinical notes, the plaintiff told her that “front car reversed into him” and he characterised the collision as “not \[very\] high impact”.

10     On balance I consider it more likely than not that the accident did cause the plaintiff to sustain some sort of whiplash injury to the neck. At the time of the accident the plaintiff was not too far away from being a senior citizen, and given his age it seems to me unlikely that he would have taken the trouble to seek medical attention if he were not feeling pain of some kind. But I find also that the resultant pain felt by the plaintiff in his neck was highly temporary in nature and not at all substantial: from the fact that he said at the time the accident statement was prepared that no one had been injured in the accident I draw the inference that he had ceased completely to feel pain well before then, meaning that the pain lasted no more than a day, and also that the pain was so minor as to have been forgettable.

11     According to the joint opening statement filed by parties the plaintiff claims $6,000 as general damages for pain and suffering for his whiplash injury. He relies on the _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“_Guidelines_”), which provide (at p 20) a range of $5,000 to $7,000 for the category of neck injury described as “Minor whiplash injury and soft tissue damage classified as Grade 1 whiplash injury”. Given the fleeting and insignificant nature of the pain experienced by the plaintiff I consider that $6,000 is grossly excessive. I do not accept that just because there is a medical diagnosis classifying the plaintiff’s injury as a Grade 1 whiplash injury he is automatically ushered within that category in the _Guidelines_ and thereby entitled to a sum of general damages between $5,000 and $7,000. The medical diagnosis is no doubt important because it generally furnishes a broad initial idea of the nature and extent of the injured person’s suffering, but since the purpose of general damages is to compensate an injured person for the pain and suffering he has endured, the focus should be less on the technicalities and semantics of the diagnosis and more on the degree of pain and suffering that has resulted from the injury.

12     The category of neck injury in the _Guidelines_ that the plaintiff relies on goes on to state that “\[t\]he symptoms of neck pain, tenderness and stiffness resolve completely between a few weeks and two years”. Thus it seems to me that for injuries to the neck the _Guidelines_ contemplate that, whatever the specific diagnosis might be, $5,000 to $7,000 is appropriate only where the pain resulting from the injury takes at least a few weeks to resolve completely. I consider also that the reference to “stiffness” indicates that this category excludes neck injuries where subjective reports of pain are unaccompanied by some restriction of motion or movement in the neck objectively observed by a medical doctor that also lasts at least a few weeks. The injury sustained by the plaintiff does not come close to falling within this category.

13     There is then a category of neck injury in the _Guidelines_ described as “Neck sprain not amounting to Grade 1 whiplash injury in which the pain resolves in a few days with no residual disabilities”. The applicable range of general damages for this category is stated to be $1,500 to $3,000. I am prepared to accept that the plaintiff’s whiplash injury answers the description in this category. But I do not think that the plaintiff is thus necessarily entitled to a minimum of $1,500 as general damages. According to the endnotes in the _Guidelines_ the figure of $1,500 is based on _Ong Zern Chern Philip v Wong Siang Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 256</span> (“_Ong Zern Chern_”), a decision of AR Gillian Koh Tan. The plaintiff in that case was a motorcyclist involved in a road accident that caused him to suffer an injury to his neck described as “neck pain with residual symptoms” together with a number of other injuries, the most serious of which were fractures of the right temporal bone and right clavicle and a torn posterior cruciate ligament. Parties agreed on a sum of $1,500 as general damages for the neck injury and AR Koh Tan duly awarded it. The evidence there was that the plaintiff “suffered from neck pain whenever he remained in a sitting position for more than 20 minutes”, and that the complaints of neck pain were “supported by objective clinical evidence such as muscle spasms” (at \[6\]).

14     I consider it safe to conclude that the neck injury suffered by the plaintiff in _Ong Zern Chern_ was significantly more serious than that sustained by the plaintiff in this case. One reason is that the accident in _Ong Zern Chern_ involved a collision much more forceful than the collision in this case: the collision in that case was forceful enough to result in broken bones. The other reason is that the neck injury in _Ong Zern Chern_ resulted in more prolonged pain than in this case. It was not expressly stated in _Ong Zern Chern_ how long the neck pain lasted, but it is evident that it lasted long enough to discern a pattern of pain being felt by the plaintiff in that case “whenever he remained in a sitting position for more than 20 minutes”. A pattern may be discerned only after a substantial number of instances fitting that pattern have been observed, and so I infer that the occurrences of pain in that case must have taken place over a space of at least several days, and at any rate must have taken place over more than a single day. It therefore seems to me that a sum substantially lower than the $1,500 agreed and awarded in _Ong Zern Chern_ is warranted in this case.

15     The defendant submitted that if it were established that the accident caused the plaintiff to sustain a whiplash injury it would be fair to award a sum of $300 as general damages. This seems to me a reasonable submission given that the plaintiff’s pain and suffering was transient and not significant. As Dr Su testified, the plaintiff’s neck injury was in the nature of muscle spasms and did not involve any “structural damage”, examples of which would be ligament micro-tears and burst blood capillaries. I asked Dr Su if muscle spasms could be equated to or even compared with a contusion in terms of their relative seriousness, and I understood from her response that a contusion might in one sense be regarded as a more serious injury than muscle spasms because contusions tend to involve structural damage whereas muscle spasms do not. If, as the _Guidelines_ provide, a sum of $500 is appropriate for single contusions (at p 59), it does not seem untoward to award something less than that for muscle spasms of such minimal intensity and brief duration as were experienced by the plaintiff in the present case. Accordingly I assess general damages for the plaintiff’s whiplash injury at $300.

16     There is some ambiguity as to whether the plaintiff is claiming general damages for what was diagnosed as a contusion of his right wrist. The ambiguity arises because that alleged injury does not appear in the joint opening statement. In any event I do not consider that any general damages should be awarded for it. This is because there was no expert evidence at all explaining how a wrist injury could possibly result from a collision as light as the one in this case. Dr Su’s testimony allowed me to comprehend how a whiplash injury could arise from such a collision, but there was no equivalent explanation elicited for the alleged wrist injury. Also, I understand from Dr Su’s evidence that a contusion involves blunt trauma and so requires some form of impact between the contused body part and another surface, but there was no evidence whatsoever of any such impact involving the plaintiff’s right wrist. I am therefore unable to find that it is more likely than not that the accident caused the plaintiff to sustain an injury to his right wrist.

17     In addition to general damages the plaintiff claims three heads of special damages: medical expenses, transport expenses and loss of income. Given my finding that the plaintiff sustained some sort of injury from the accident I think that it was reasonable for him to have sought medical attention and hence he should in principle have a claim for medical expenses incurred. The defendant does not dispute the amount of medical expenses claimed by the plaintiff and so I assess that at $276.86.

18     As for transport expenses the plaintiff claims $50 being the cost of a round trip to Mount Alvernia Hospital. In principle I think he should have a claim for transport expenses incurred but there is no evidence at all as to how this figure of $50 was computed: there are no transport-related receipts and in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief the plaintiff was silent on such basic details as (i) the place from which he travelled to the hospital, (ii) the place to which he travelled from the hospital, and (iii) the mode of transportation that he used. Even if I assume that the plaintiff travelled by taxi from his home in Woodlands to Mount Alvernia Hospital and back, I think he has to explain why it was necessary to seek medical attention at that particular hospital and not some other clinic or hospital nearer his home. He testified that he chose a hospital rather than a clinic because clinics do not provide X-ray services, and that he wanted to visit a private hospital rather than a public hospital because it would mean a shorter waiting time, and that he had been told by “a lot of people” whom he had met in his line of work that the “doctors are more professional” at Mount Alvernia Hospital. I accept that it is reasonable to want a shorter waiting time for medical consultation, but I was not shown any basis for his dubious sweeping statement that all private clinics do not have X-ray facilities and I see no reason to believe that doctors outside Mount Alvernia Hospital are any less professional or competent than doctors at that hospital. Hence I do not see why it was necessary for the plaintiff to have visited Mount Alvernia Hospital instead of some other private clinic or hospital nearer his home. In the circumstances I cannot award the plaintiff $50 for transport expenses. Given that the defendant submitted that $20 would “generally be fair and reasonable” I assess damages for transport expenses incurred at $20.

19     As for loss of income it appears from the joint opening statement that the plaintiff claims $1,113.87: this is computed by taking what he says is his average daily income of $185.63 multiplied by the six days on which he was on outpatient medical leave. The figure of $185.63 is apparently derived from a weekly income of $1,299.43. But the plaintiff has provided no evidence at all as to his income. The numbers set out in the joint opening statement are nowhere found in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief and there is no documentary evidence whatsoever of his earnings. Given the complete absence of evidence in this regard I do not see how I could possibly assess damages for loss of income. I would add that even though the plaintiff was given six days of outpatient medical leave it does not follow that he should be permitted to claim loss of income for six days. I have found that the plaintiff ceased to experience pain after a day, so there is no reason why he should have been unable to work in the five days that followed, and in any event the insignificant nature of the pain ought not to have affected his ability to work to any substantial degree. For these reasons the plaintiff is not entitled to any damages for loss of income.

20     In summary, I assess damages as follows: (i) $300 as general damages for pain and suffering, (ii) $276.86 as special damages for medical expenses incurred, and $20 as special damages for transport expenses incurred. The aggregate of these sums is $596.86, and since the plaintiff is entitled to 90% of the damages assessed he should receive $537.17. If parties cannot agree on costs and would like me to fix costs they should say so in writing by 13 August 2019 so that a hearing can be convened for that purpose. If they do not write in by then costs will be taxed if not agreed.

21     It may seem that I have adopted an unduly exacting approach to the evidence that is uncalled for given the relatively low value of the sums being claimed. But I think that such an impression is mistaken. Whatever the value of the claim might be the plaintiff bears the burden of proving every material facet of his case on a balance of probabilities. That means, for instance, that he must be able to justify the sum being claimed for transport expenses incurred even if that sum is in the order of mere tens of dollars. To take another example, it means that a bare assertion in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that he earns so much income a day will not suffice if it can reasonably be expected that there should exist documentary evidence of such income, in particular statements of income tax where the amount of income he asserts crosses the threshold for taxability. It is the court’s function to scrutinise every claim in order to ensure that relief is granted only where it is factually and legally correct to do so, and plaintiffs ought to be advised that where the evidence they proffer falls short the court may reduce their claim or dismiss it entirely.
