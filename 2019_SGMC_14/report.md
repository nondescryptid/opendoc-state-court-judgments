\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9045/2019/01-02 \]

2 April 2019

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

1       The Accused pleaded guilty before me to three charges, namely:

(a)     MCN 901020/2017:

between May and August 2016 … being the employer of one Yani, a domestic maid, did use threatening behaviour, with intent to cause alarm to the said Yani, to wit, by tapping her face with the side of a knife blade, thereby causing alarm to the said Yani and you have thereby committed an offence under section 3(1)(a) punishable under section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap. 256A, 2015 Rev. Ed.);

(b)     MCN 901021/2017:

between May and August 2016…, being the employer of one Yani, a domestic maid, did voluntarily cause hurt to the said Yani, to wit, by pinching her repeatedly on her face and arms, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) and read with section 73(2) of the said Act; and

(c)     MCN 901022/2017:

on 1 August 2016 at or about 9am … being the employer of one Yani, a domestic maid, did voluntarily cause hurt to the said Yani, to wit, by punching her on her left eye, hitting her arm with a pole and pinching her right hand, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) and read with section 73(2) of the said Act.

2       Five other charges for voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (“Penal Code”) relating to physical abuse of the same domestic helper were taken into consideration. I sentenced the Accused as follows:

(a)     MCN 901020/2017: 2 weeks’ imprisonment;

(b)     MCN 901021/2017: 2 months’ imprisonment; and

(c)     MCN 901022/2017: 3 months’ imprisonment.

3       I ordered the longest and shortest sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively giving a global sentence of 3 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution, being dissatisfied with the sentence, has filed an appeal against sentence. The Accused has subsequently filed a cross- appeal against sentence. She is currently on bail pending the hearing of this appeal.

4       I now set out my grounds of decision for the sentence.

#### The Statement of Facts

5       The following has been admitted by the Accused without any qualification. The Accused is Ms Lee Siew Choon, a 49-year-old Singaporean female. She was working as a clerk, and staying with her husband and two grown-up sons at a flat in Singapore (“the flat”).

6       The victim is Yani, a 23-year-old female Indonesian. She was a domestic worker employed by the Accused at the material time.

#### First Information Report

7       On 1 August 2016 at around 4.06 p.m., the police received a ‘999’ call from the victim stating: “My employer always assaulted me.” The victim was making the call from Block 399 Yung Sheng Road, Taman Jurong Shopping Centre.

#### Background Facts

8       Investigations revealed that the victim started working for the Accused on 24 May 2016. The victim was expected to perform household chores such as washing clothes, cleaning the house and cooking meals. She would start work at 5.25 a.m., and finish around midnight. The victim did not get any off-days and did not have a mobile phone.

9       Shortly after the victim started working for the Accused, the Accused began pinching the victim on various parts of her body, including her arms, flanks and back, frequently whenever she made mistakes. The Accused would pinch the victim hard with her fingernails and leave fingernail marks and abrasions on the parts of the victim’s body that she pinched. The victim did not tell anyone about the abuse because the Accused told her not to inform anyone, and the victim did not know what to do.

#### Facts pertaining to the 6th charge MCN 901020/2017

10     Sometime between May and August 2016, the victim was cutting onions in the kitchen. The Accused noticed that the victim was not cutting the onions in the way she had instructed. The Accused then picked up the knife, and tapped the victim on her face with the side of the knife blade, causing the victim alarm.

11     By tapping the victim on her face with the side of a knife blade, the Accused did use threatening behaviour, with intent to cause alarm to the victim, and has thereby committed an offence under section 3(1)(a) punishable under section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act.

#### Facts pertaining to the 7th charge MCN 901021/2017

12     Sometime between May and August 2016, the Accused scolded the victim whilst she was cleaning the house. The Accused then pinched the victim’s face and arms repeatedly. The Accused’s pinches were painful as the Accused’s fingernails dug into the victim’s skin, and left abrasions and fingernail marks all over the victim’s face and arms.

13     By pinching the victim on her face and arms repeatedly, and causing her abrasions on her face and arms, the Accused has thereby committed an offence under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code.

#### Facts pertaining to the 8th Charge MCN 901022/2017

14     On 1 August 2016 at about 9 a.m., the victim was hanging out the clothes to dry. The Accused was upset that the victim had not opened the window in the room. The Accused punched the victim on her left eye, causing her vision to blur. She then grabbed a wooden pole with a plastic hook attached, which is commonly used to hook up laundry poles. The accused used the said wooden pole to hit the victim with a lot of force on her upper left arm, causing the victim much pain. Thereafter, the Accused pinched the victim’s right hand.

15     Sometime later, the Accused left the house to go to work. There was no one in the Accused’s flat at this time, and the victim ran away from the Accused’s flat on the same afternoon. The victim walked around the estate, and approached passers-by for help. A passer-by gave her some coins, and she proceeded to call the police from a public phone at the nearby market. The police arrived shortly after and brought her to the police station.

16     By punching the victim on her left eye, hitting her arm with a pole, and pinching her right hand, thereby causing her bodily harm, the Accused has committed an offence under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code.

#### The victim’s injuries

17     The victim was subsequently sent to the Emergency Medicine Department (“EMD”) of the National University Hospital (“NUH”) for medical examination on 2 August 2016. The victim complained of pain over the left arm, upper back, occipital head and blurring of vision.

18     The NUH medical report dated 5 August 2016 stated that the victim had sustained the following injuries:

(a)     Contusion over left mandible;

(b)     Mild tenderness over right arm, right upper back region and occipital scalp; and

(c)     Multiple abrasions over both arms, both flanks and back which were in different healing stages. (Refer to photographs of the victim’s injuries.)

19     An x-ray of the victim’s chest, left humerus, mandible and facial bones showed no fractures. The victim was discharged well from the EMD with diagnosis of contusion of left face, multiple abrasions and eye disorder. She was given appointments with the eye clinic, dental clinic and polyclinic.

20     A follow-up medical examination was conducted on 16 May 2017 at the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”). The SGH report dated 26 July 2017 noted multiple small old scars of less than 1cm in length over her entire abdominal wall, lower back and over both her upper limbs. The victim informed that she still had visible marks on her body, as of 23 August 2018.

#### Scarring

21     The prosecution had tendered photographs of the victim which were taken soon after the case was reported showing very visible marks on various parts of her body such as her face and arms which were the result of the injuries inflicted by the Accused.

22     As the photographs were quite dated, I requested for more recent photographs and the same were tendered by prosecution. It is noted that the scarring has healed considerably and only faint marks were seen on the arms and back of the victim. No photographs were tendered of the victim’s face. Prosecution confirmed that the pinch marks on the face were no longer visible.

#### Antecedent records

23     The Accused has no antecedents.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

24     The Prosecution sought for the Accused to be sentenced globally to 7 months’ imprisonment with the breakdown as follows:

(a)     for MCN 901020-2017 under section 3(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act, at least 1 month’s imprisonment; and

(b)     for MCN 901021-2017 and MCN 901022-2017 under s 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code, at least 6 months’ imprisonment each;

with two sentences of imprisonment, namely in MCN 901020-2017 and MCN 901022-2017 to run consecutively, to arrive at a global sentence of at least 7 months’ imprisonment.

25     The Prosecution relied on the pronouncement of the Court of Appeal in _ADF v Public Prosecutor_ \[2010\] 1 SLR 898, at \[91\], that a custodial sentence is invariably the starting point where there has been any manner of physical abuse against a domestic maid, and a fine will only be imposed in a “really exceptional case”. They further cited an example given by the High Court of an exceptional case in _Chong Yee Ka v Public Prosecutor_ (“_Chong Yee Ka_”), at \[82\], where the offender’s psychiatric condition has “contributed so significantly to the offending conduct that it diminishes the offender’s capacity to exercise self-control and restraint”, and thus the offender’s culpability.

26     The Prosecution then argued that the present case did not qualify as such an “exceptional case”. They relied on the fact that the psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) (Dr Cheow Enquan) and the Defence’s psychologist (Dr Julia CY Lam of Forensic Psych Services) have opined that the Accused although diagnosed with an adjustment disorder at the time of the offences, the disorder did not cause the Accused to commit the offences _per se_ but only partially contributed to it in the sense that she was in a state of irritability and frustration which affected her capacity to exercise self-control at the material time. Dr Cheow clarified that the Accused’s adjustment disorder only limited her ability to exercise self-control to a small extent.

27     The Prosecution also referred to the observation made by the High Court in _Chong Yee Ka_ that “the acts \[of the offender there\] appeared to be impulsive and spontaneous outbursts” rather than “a pattern of calculated and systematic abuse” (at \[73\]). They then asserted that in the present case, in contrast, the victim was subject to physical abuse on eight separate occasions over the course of at least two months and hence amounted to a prolonged period of systematic abuse and not a one-off act of impulse. They also asserted that the use of various implements (including a plate, a comb, a wooden pole and a knife) on the victim further suggested a degree of deliberateness.

28     The Prosecution further submitted that the Accused was not facing any significant stressors, aside from her displeasure with the victim’s standard of work. The Prosecution pointed out that the fact that the Accused lashed out only at the victim and no one else showed that her ability to exercise self-control in choosing who she would direct her abusive behaviour at was not diminished. This was in contrast to the case of _Soh Meiyun v Public Prosecutor_ (“_Soh Meiyun_”) where the offender’s violent behaviour was directed at not just her maid, but also her husband.

29     On the length of imprisonment, applying the framework in _Tay Wee Kiat and Anor v Public Prosecutor_ (“_Tay Wee Kiat_”) on sentencing for maid abuse cases, at \[71\], the Prosecution submitted that the present case involves medium physical harm and medium psychological harm and hence the starting point range would be 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment. After taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case, the Prosecution arrived at a sentence of at least 6 months’ imprisonment for each section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code charge.

30     The Prosecution highlighted the fact that both the physical and psychological harm was at least medium. The abrasions and scars were extensive and highly visible – being found all over the victim’s body, particularly on her face, arms and back. They also pointed out the fact that the victim’s scars remaining visible to date would present a continuing source of psychological pain.

31     The Prosecution also listed other aggravating factors:

(a)     the use of a pole to assault the victim and the use of other implements such as a comb to cause hurt;

(b)     the Accused asking the victim not to tell anyone about the assaults; and

(c)     the 5 other charges under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code that are taken into consideration.

32     The Prosecution acknowledged that the Accused had demonstrated genuine remorse by pleading guilty and making voluntary compensation of $6,828.00 to the victim, and that she was suffering from an adjustment disorder which had minimally affected her self-control at the material time. Taking all these into account together with the aggravating factors, the Prosecution arrived at a submission of 6 months’ imprisonment.

33     In respect of MCN 901020/2017, the Prosecution submitted that the aggravating factors in this case had crossed the custodial threshold and thus a sentence of at least 1 month’s imprisonment was warranted. This was given that the victim was a vulnerable victim as an employee and the threatening behaviour in question involved the use of a knife, which is an inherently dangerous instrument that had undoubtedly caused great alarm to the victim.

34     On the global sentence, the Prosecution submitted for the sentences for MCN 901020-2017 and MCN 901022-2017 to run consecutively, to arrive at a sentence of at least 7 months’ imprisonment.

#### Mitigation

35     The Defence Counsel submitted for a short custodial sentence of 3 weeks in total, with one sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment for each section 323 of the Penal Code charge to run consecutively with one week’s imprisonment for the section 3(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act charge. He set out in mitigation the following factors:

(a)     the Accused’s show of remorse through her guilty plea as well as compensation voluntarily made towards the victim. The Accused had also been fully cooperative with the police;

(b)     the injuries were minor;

(c)     the medical condition of the Accused. The Defence highlighted that the Accused was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct and the increase in her dosage of medication had led to psychiatric side-effects of irritability. The Accused was also suffering from Lupus and was prescribed a cocktail of medication that altered her emotions and distressed her. Her doctor, Dr Julia Lam, had opined these as contributing factors for her offending behaviour in a moment of fury and frustration; and

(d)     the conduct of the victim was the main stressor for the Accused as the victim had failed to complete basic tasks by the time the Accused returned home from work. The Accused had to still cook and wash and supervise the victim till late leading to the Accused being infuriated and lashing out at the Accused. In the mitigation, the Accused also stated that the victim was looking out of the window when the Accused was teaching her how to cut a garlic thus leading to her using the knife to tap the victim on the cheek.

#### The Principles of Sentencing

36     This is a case of physical abuse of a female domestic worker. The dominant sentencing principles applicable in such cases would be deterrence and retribution. A strong deterrent message has been consistently sent out in the form of substantial terms of imprisonment to protect domestic maids against such abuse. It has been well accepted that our foreign female domestic worker is clearly in a vulnerable position, coming to a foreign country to work and living under the roof of her employer. She would be very much at the mercy of her employer if she is abused, being in a disadvantaged position of unfamiliarity with her new environment and having a lack of social support. The victim in the present case also had the added disadvantage of having no off-days from work and had no mobile phone, thus the feeling of being trapped and helpless would be even more acute.

37     However, I also bore in mind that there can be exceptional circumstances such that non-custodial sentences can be imposed as in the cases of _Soh Meiyun_ and _Chong Yee Ka._ This would be in a case where the psychiatric disorder plaguing the Accused was severe and had contributed so significantly to the offending behaviour such that culpability of the offender is greatly reduced, justifying the departure from the norm of custodial sentences.

38     I also take guidance from _Chong Yee Ka_ at \[82\] where See Kee Oon J had stated that ultimately “each case must be considered on its factual matrix. The crucial issue is whether the disorder(s) in question can be said to have contributed so significantly to the offending conduct that it diminishes the offender’s capacity to exercise self-control and restraint, and hence reduces her culpability in the circumstances.”

#### The medical and psychiatric conditions of the Accused

39     Turning to the present case, both the Accused’s private psychiatrist, Dr Julia Lam, and the forensic psychiatrist from IMH, Dr Cheow Enquan, are in agreement that the Accused was suffering from Adjustment Disorder at the material time of the offences. This disorder developed as a result of the Accused feeling very stressed and frustrated by the situation of having to supervise and finish up incomplete work by the victim after a long day at the office.

40     Both doctors are also in agreement that the disorder had contributed to the offending behaviour. Dr Julia Lam stated that the Accused’s “Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct and an increase of dosage in her SLE \[(Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)\] medication leading to psychiatric side-effects of mood swing and irritability were contributing factors to her offending behaviour in a moment of fury and frustration.” (See paragraph 30 of Dr Lam’s report dated 16 September 2017.) Dr Cheow opined that the Accused’s psychiatric condition “did not cause the Accused to commit the offences _per se_ but partially contributed to it in the sense that she was in a state of irritability and frustration which affected her capacity to exercise self-control at the material time.” (See paragraph e(ii) of Dr Cheow’s report dated 1 October 2018.)

41     The Accused was taking a variety of medication to cope with a long term serious medical condition called Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (“SLE”) which included mycophenolate mofetil. Dr Cheow said that there is a case report in the literature of depressive disorder that is associated with this drug but he opined that it is unlikely to have any direct contribution to the Accused’s adjustment disorder. In contrast, Dr Lam appeared to have relied on the Accused’s self-reporting that after her medication of mycophenolate mofetil has increased, she found herself more irritable and easily tired. Dr Lam went on to conclude that the Accused’s chronic use of hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil would have further exacerbated her moodiness and irritability.

42     The Accused was being treated for SLE by Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”). In the medical report by Dr Kong Kok Ooi, Senior Consultant Rheumatologist of TTSH, dated 9 March 2017, some psychiatric side effects were reported in respect of three of the medications the Accused was on. The medications and psychiatric side effects are as set out in this table:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="0"><colgroup><col width="35.84%"> <col width="64.16%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Type of medication</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Psychiatric side-effects</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Losartan</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Insomnia, sleep disorder, anxiety, anxiety disorder, confusion, depression, dream abnormality, libido decreased, nervousness, panic disorder</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Hydroxychloroquine</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Irritability, nervousness, emotional changes, nightmares, psychosis</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Prednisolone</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Behavioural changes, mood changes, irritability, suicidal thoughts, psychotic reactions, mania, delusions, hallucinations, aggravation of schizophrenia, anxiety, sleep disorders, amnesia, depression, emotional instability, euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, psychological dependence</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

43     In the light of the reports, even if there is a question mark over the side-effect of mycophenolate mifotel, I accept that at least three other medications taken by the Accused had heightened her state of irritability, contributing to her psychiatric disorder which in turn had a contributory link to her offending behaviour.

#### Should a non-custodial sentence be imposed?

44     However, I found that the Accused still possessed enough self-awareness to realise what she was doing was wrong, as evidenced by her telling the victim not to disclose to anyone of the injuries inflicted on her. Further, Dr Cheow had opined that her adjustment disorder did not mean that she was unable to control herself at the material time. In his further report, Dr Cheow elaborated on this. He stated that the Accused’s “ability to exercise self-control was impaired due to her frustrated and irritable mental state but **_was only limited to a small extent_**. She could have chosen to send the victim back if the victim’s performance was so unsatisfactory but she instead chose to continue to employ the victim and continued to pinch her repeatedly despite knowing that it was wrong to do so.” (My emphasis.)

45     This comment by Dr Cheow is supported by the history of the employment of domestic helpers by the Accused. It is reported in Dr Lam’s report that the Accused had informed her that for her previous nine domestic helpers before the victim, all had left the job after completing their contracts, save for the last one. This last domestic helper was perceived by the Accused to have an attitude problem evidenced by her throwing a container at the Accused and refusing to do housework. The Accused sent this domestic helper to the agency after three months.

46     I therefore found that the Accused was capable of taking a similar action against the victim when she found her performance unsatisfactory. Instead she had resorted to violence to vent her frustration on her and repeatedly done so in response to each act of perceived poor performance. Even if she had lost control the first time, the Accused should have realised the wrongfulness of her actions and taken action to prevent recurrence. Instead she chose to continue with the employment of the victim and had no qualms of persisting with her offending behaviour after warning the victim to keep quiet about the abuse.

47     In my view therefore, her psychiatric condition was not so severe and did not incapacitate her ability to control herself to lessen her culpability to an extent that justifies departing from imposing custodial sentences on her.

48     Both Prosecution and Defence are in agreement on the nature of the appropriate sentence, which is custodial sentence. They only differ in their views on the length of the imprisonment terms, a subject which I will now turn to.

#### The length of the custodial sentence

49     In _Tay Wee Kiat_, the sentencing approach in respect of maid abuse cases prescribed by the High Court involves the first step of determining whether the harm caused to the victim was predominantly physical, or both physical and psychological. In this regard, even if the acts of abuse were not particularly degrading or amount to humiliating treatment, the court can still consider that there is psychological harm if the offending acts form a broader trend or history of abusive conduct. (See _Tay Wee Kiat_, at \[70\].)

50     In the present case, the Accused had abused the victim through habitual pinching and other forms of assault over a relatively long period of more than two months from May to August 2016, resulting in a total of eight charges. The acts of using her fingernails to dig into the flesh of the victim resulting in abrasions and scarring over the face, arms and back of her body would be both physically painful and humiliating. Two sets of photographs were tendered. The first set was taken soon after she had reported to the police. Pinch marks were highly visible on both cheeks of the victim. Numerous marks were seen on both her upper arms stretching from her shoulder to the elbow. The injuries were not superficial as the marks could still be seen months later. In the medical report dated 26 July 2017, it was stated that when the victim was seen by the doctor on 16 May 2017, multiple small old scars of less than l cm in length were seen over her entire abdominal wall, lower back and over both her upper limbs. This was about nine months after the last case of assault by the accused. I have no doubt that seeing these marks on her face and arms would have caused much psychological and emotional pain to the victim. The only consolation is that the marks on the cheeks appear to have cleared up. There was no more mention of any marks on her face and the subsequent set of photographs tendered in court did not show the face of the victim. This suggests that there were no more residual marks on her face.

51     As for the physical harm, apart from pinching, what is aggravating is the Accused’s use of a wooden pole to hit the victim forcefully on her arm in the charge MCN 901022/2017. The Accused had also used a pole to hit the victim in one of the charges taken into consideration MCN 901018/2017. It is fortuitous that the victim did not suffer any fracture from the hit.

52     I also noted that on this occasion, the Accused had punched the victim in the eye, causing her to have blurred vision. The medical report dated 5 August 2016 stated that she was diagnosed with an eye disorder as a result of her blurred vision. The Accused had punched the victim on a vulnerable part of her body which affected a very critical component of anyone’s bodily function – the sense of vision. It was fortunate that nothing more serious was reported when the victim was further examined in 2017.

53     On the whole I found that the physical and psychological harm caused would fall into category of the higher band of less serious physical and psychological harm set out or the lower end of category of more serious physical and psychological harm. The prescribed sentence range would therefore toggle between the two sentencing ranges of 3 to 6 months and 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment. I would also say that the use of the wooden pole and the punching of the eye would be more serious than the offence of mere pinching.

#### Other factors taken into consideration

54     The next step would be to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors of the case. I took into account the five charges taken into consideration. I did not put too much weight on the incidents of assault using a comb as on the face of it, they do not appear to be serious. However, there was one charge MCN 901015/2017 where she was hit on the head with a plate which caused her head to bleed. This is clearly a relatively serious offence as it involves a vulnerable part of her body – the head – and the force used was sufficiently strong to cause bleeding.

55     On the mitigating factors, I accept that the Accused had shown remorse by her plea of guilty as well as her voluntary payment of compensation of a substantial amount of $6,828.00 which would go some way in ameliorating the pain and suffering endured by the victim.

#### Reasoning for the length of the sentence

56     I also found the psychiatric state of the Accused to be significant in contributing to the offending behaviour as highlighted above. While not condoning her actions, I am of the view that her adjustment disorder which was exacerbated by her cocktail of medication which has known psychiatric side effects at a stressful moment of her life did contribute to the offences. Accordingly, taking into account the overall seriousness of the offences and her mitigating circumstances, I was prepared to bring the overall length of her sentence for voluntarily causing hurt offences from a sentence of 6 to 8 months down to 3 months’ imprisonment.

57     I therefore imposed a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment and 2 months’ imprisonment for the two voluntarily causing hurt offences, with the slightly longer sentence imposed on MCN 901022/2017 to reflect the relatively more serious harm caused by the using of a wooden pole and punching the eye.

58     As for the offence of use of threatening behaviour under section 3(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act, I found that the Accused’s use of a knife and the making of contact between the knife and the cheek of the victim to be sufficiently serious for the custodial threshold to be crossed. It was both a threatening and humiliating way of getting someone’s attention. However, I note that the circumstances were that of the Accused trying to get the victim to pay attention and not to harm her physically. The Accused did not use the sharp end of the knife but the side of the knife blade to tap on the victim’s face. Accordingly, I am of the view that a relatively short period of 2 weeks’ imprisonment would be warranted.

#### Conclusion

59     Taking into account the totality of her offending behaviour, I ordered the shortest sentence to run with the longest sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment, giving a total sentence of 3 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment. I am of the view that this sentence would appropriately reflect both the seriousness of the offences committed against the victim as well as the mitigating factors in this case particularly the psychiatric condition of the Accused which had partially contributed to her offending behaviour.
