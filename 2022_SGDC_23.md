7 February 2022

### District Judge Sheik Umar Bin Mohamed Bagushair:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff’s claim arose out of the injuries he suffered on 24 October 2018 when he slipped on an unsecured metal decking that had been laid above some pipes to cover up a drain. The Plaintiff, together with a co-worker Mr Sheikh Mohammad Kawsar (“Mr Kawsar”), had been laying metal deckings over the drain, tying and securing them to pipes (the “Works”), for one and a half days when the accident happened. It is the Plaintiff’s case that when Mr Kawsar had left to collect more metal deckings, the Plaintiff had carried two metal deckings over his left shoulder and walked over an unsecured metal decking. He slipped and fell backwards, injuring his arm and back. I will refer to the Plaintiff’s account of what happened as the “Accident”.

2       The Defendant was the Plaintiff’s employer. Its central defence is that the Accident was staged by the Plaintiff so that he could receive substantial compensation. The Defendant relied heavily on the evidence of Mr Gurdit Singh (“Mr Singh”), the Plaintiff’s co-worker. Mr Singh trained in Chennai with the Plaintiff and they travelled to Singapore together to work for the Defendant. In Singapore, they stayed in the same dormitory and shared a room. Mr Singh’s evidence was that the Plaintiff and Mr Arun Kumar (“Mr Kumar”) (who had trained in Chennai together with the Plaintiff and Mr Singh) had discussed staging accidents to claim substantial compensation for their injuries.

3       On 2 November 2021, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim. I gave brief reasons for my decision. The Plaintiff has appealed, and I now set out my detailed grounds.

## Parties’ positions

4       The Plaintiff argued that the Accident occurred as pleaded and denied that it was staged. The Works were conducted in an unsafe manner and the Defendant was in breach of its duties as an employer. The Defendant had also breached the Workplace Safety and Health (Scaffolds) Regulations 2011 (2020 Rev Ed) (“Scaffolds Regulations”). This was because the Works involved the erection of a scaffold and the Works should only have been done by trained scaffold erectors. Neither the Plaintiff nor Mr Kawsar were trained scaffold erectors. Furthermore, no scaffold supervisor was present to supervise the Works, and this too was in breach of the Scaffolds Regulations.

5       The Defendant relied heavily on Mr Singh’s evidence and submitted that the Plaintiff had staged the Accident. Mr Singh’s evidence was that the Plaintiff and Mr Kumar had on several occasions discussed staging accidents to receive substantial compensation. Even if the Accident was not staged, it was wholly caused by the Plaintiff’s negligence. The Works were fairly simple and uncomplicated and did not require any special training or skills. The Plaintiff was instructed to assist a more experienced worker, Mr Kawsar, to complete the Works. Daily toolbox meetings were also held and there was in place a safe system of work. There was no good reason for the Plaintiff to carry two heavy metal deckings on his shoulder (each weighing at least 12 kg) while standing over the pipes or unsecured metal deckings. This was reckless. Finally, the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff was not entitled to argue that it had breached the Scaffold Regulations because he had not pleaded it. In any event, the Works did not involve the construction of a scaffold.

## Issues

6       The issues I had to decide were:

> (a)     Whether the Plaintiff staged the Accident.

> (b)     If the Plaintiff had not staged the Accident, did the Defendant breach the Scaffold Regulations?

> (c)     If the Scaffold Regulations were not breached, had the Defendant nevertheless breached its duties to the Plaintiff?

## The Trial

7       The trial before me was bifurcated and took place over four days. The Plaintiff gave evidence and did not call any other witness. The Defendant called as witnesses Mr Singh, Mr Kawsar and Mr Kealy Low Hock Yew (“Mr Low”), the Defendant’s work safety and health coordinator.

## The Plaintiff’s evidence

8       In the Plaintiff’s AEIC, he explained that on the day of the Accident (_ie_, 24 October 2018) he had been tasked to do the Works together with Mr Kawsar. They had started doing the Works the day before. Mr Kawsar was more senior than him and he followed his instructions. The Plaintiff’s job was to carry the metal deckings and lay them over galvanized iron (“GI”) pipes that had been installed over the drain. The Plaintiff said that it was Mr Kawsar, and not him, who would then tie the metal deckings to the GI pipes. The picture below shows how the drain, the GI pipes over the drain, and the metal deckings were placed.

![]([2022] SGDC 0023_Image/[2022] SGDC 0023_image1.png)

9       In his AEIC, the Plaintiff addressed the circumstances leading to the Accident and the Accident itself as follows:

> 10.    On the day of the accident, we had just started our work of collecting the metal deckings from the store. I stayed at the accident site while Kawsar went to collect the metal deckings on his bobcat.

> 11.    He told me to just lay the metal deckings and he will return and tie them after he had collected more deckings. Following his instructions, I proceeded to lay the metal deckings.

> 12.    At the time of the accident, I had already laid some metal deckings over the GI pipes above the drain and was carrying 2 metal deckings on my left shoulder to lay the same above the pipes. I was walking on the metal deckings I had laid and was going further down to lay the 2 metal deckings I was carrying. However, my foot slipped on an unsecured metal decking which I had just laid above the GI pipes and I fell backwards hitting my back against the GI pipes. During my fall, I inadvertently let go of the 2 metal deckings that I was carrying. One of the metal deckings hit my arm, causing a fracture. I sustained personal injuries as a result of the fall.

> 13.    After my fall, even though I was in excruciating pain, I had to get up on my own. I waited for about 15 to 20 minutes but no one came. Kawsar came back much later from the store and I told him that I had just fallen and sustained injuries.

10     During his examination-in-chief, the Plaintiff amended paragraph 12 of his AEIC, saying that “it’s not my foot that slipped…\[i\]t is the metal decking that is on the pipe that slipped.”

11     During cross-examination, the Plaintiff gave further details as to how the Accident happened.

12     On the day of the accident itself, the Plaintiff and Mr Kawsar had started working from about 9:30 am. At about 11 am to 11:30 am, Mr Kawsar had left to collect more metal deckings. The Plaintiff continued to lay metal deckings. He started by first picking up metal deckings that had been placed close to the drain. In the photo at \[8\] above, the area where the metal deckings were stored would be at the bottom left of the photo (where a piece of metal decking can be partially seen).

13     The drain over which the metal deckings was to be placed was long and ran around the perimeter of the worksite. The depth of the drain was about 2.5 feet (or about 76 cm) and its width was about 3.5 feet (or slightly over 1 metre).

14     The Plaintiff carried the metal deckings and walked over the horizontal GI pipe to get to the other side of the drain (_ie_, the hoarding side – see photo at \[8\] above pointing out where the hoarding was). The metal deckings were placed one by one. The metal deckings can only be laid from the hoarding side. This was what the Plaintiff was told.

15     After having placed three metal deckings side by side (none were secured), the Plaintiff collected two metal deckings and carried them horizontally on his left shoulder. The Plaintiff said there were two types of metal deckings, one heavier than the other. The heavier metal decking weighed 15 kg and the other weighed 12 kg. He could not recall which ones he carried when the Accident happened but the total weight of the metal deckings over his shoulder would have been between 24 kg and 30 kg. He walked over the horizontal GI pipe and then had to position himself by turning his body to the right. He did this whilst balancing himself on top of the GI pipe and balancing the metal deckings over his left shoulder. While carrying the metal deckings, he would have to both squat and bend a little before he can lay down the metal deckings on the GI pipes.

16     Just before the Accident, his left foot was on the third metal decking (_ie_, the third one from the hoarding) and his other foot was on the GI pipe. However, he lifted his right foot and it was whilst he was doing so that the Accident occurred. He fell backwards and the metal deckings he was carrying hit his left hand.

17     When queried why he had to lift his right foot, the Plaintiff said the following:

> Cross-examination of the Plaintiff

> A:    So, when my left foot is placed on the metal decking, I have to lift my right foot.

> Q:    Are you going to stand on a foot and walk?

> A:    So, I have to lift my right foot over towards where my left foot is, and then there I turn around before I can lay the metal decking.

> Q:    So, is he saying, before he lays any metal decking, both of his foot will be above the GI pipes? The horizontal GI pipes.

> A:    Yes.

18     I would just pause to comment that lifting his right foot (which is on the GI pipe) to where his left foot was (which is on the unsecured metal decking) would not make sense if his intention was to be standing on the GI pipes before laying the metal decking. Lifting his right foot to where his left foot was would in fact bring both his feet to the unsecured metal decking.

19     As he fell, he tried to grab hold of the GI pipes. When he fell, he hit the bottom horizontal pipe along the length of the drain (close to the bottom of the photograph at \[8\] above). Apart from the injury to his arm, no other part of his body was hit by the metal deckings he was carrying on his shoulder.

20     The Plaintiff confirmed that the Accident occurred between 11 am to 11:30 am, when Mr Kawsar had left to collect more metal deckings.

21     Apart from providing further details on the events leading up to the Accident, the Plaintiff also addressed a number of other matters which were not addressed in his AEIC.

22     First, the Plaintiff stated that after arriving in Singapore, he had never met Mr Kumar before the Accident (_ie_, before 24 October 2018). The Plaintiff’s relationship with Mr Kumar was not addressed at all in his AEIC, even though his relationship with him was something specifically raised and pleaded in the Defence (see paragraph 5 of the Defence). The Plaintiff during cross-examination said that he met Mr Kumar only after the Accident. He bumped into Mr Kumar when he was on his way to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) and requested Mr Kumar’s help to interpret because the Plaintiff did not know English. He also met Mr Kumar after that and helped him pay his hospital bill.

23     Second, he stated that when he reported unsafe work conditions to his supervisors, they would “kick \[him\], they will scold in their language, sometimes they will scold vulgarities.” This happened three or four times after he started working with the Defendant. Even though this was a highly relevant fact as it supported the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant did not maintain a safe working environment, it was never raised in his AEIC.

24     Third, even though there was documentary evidence that the Plaintiff had attended a toolbox meeting in the morning on the day of the Accident during which safety was discussed, the Plaintiff disputed this. The Plaintiff instead asserted that the Defendants “just tell us about signing a piece of paper, mark your attendance, and then the foreman will tell you to go with who and who.” In fact, the Plaintiff asserted that ever since he started working with the Defendant, there was never a real toolbox meeting and that all that the Defendant did was take attendance. Again, even though it would have supported the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant did not maintain a safe working environment, these matters were never raised in his AEIC.

25     Fourth, the Plaintiff said that the ends of the metal decking, after being placed on the GI pipes, should protrude out of the GI pipes by about 6 inches (or about 15 cm) in order for the metal decking to have support. Anything less than that would mean the metal decking was unstable. Although the Plaintiff said in his AEIC that he was inexperienced in doing the Works, and therefore should not have been tasked to do the Works, the Plaintiff was nevertheless confident enough to come to this conclusion about the appropriate length of the metal decking as he thought that “any child” would have known this.

26     Fifth, the Plaintiff said during his cross-examination that on 26 October 2018, he had told the Defendant that he was in pain and needed to see the doctor. However, they refused to bring him to the doctor on the basis that there was already a medical appointment fixed for him on 1 November 2018. The Defendant’s purported refusal to allow the Plaintiff to seek medical attention was not mentioned in his AEIC.

27     Sixth, the Plaintiff said that on 27 October 2018, he went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) with a friend. He had met this friend only after the Accident and had bumped into him whilst in Little India. The Plaintiff apparently knew this person because they had lived in the same village. However, the Plaintiff did not know his name and did not know how to contact him. The Plaintiff stayed with this friend for several days and he helped the Plaintiff purchase food and helped him with daily activities which he found hard to do, such as going to the bathroom, putting on clothes, bathing and cooking food.

## Mr Kawsar’s evidence

28     Mr Kawsar’s AEIC was brief but he annexed a statement that was recorded from him on 27 October 2018. However, there is also a more contemporaneous statement, taken from him on 26 October 2018, which was not annexed to his AEIC. However, no issue arises from this because Mr Kawsar confirmed that he made both statements.

29     As both statements are fairly short, I reproduce them in full. The first statement made on 26 October 2018 at around 1:30 pm was as follows:

> On 24th Oct 2018 at about 09:30hrs, the \[Plaintiff\] and myself were tasked by our supervisor to lay metal decking on the link way. Both of us gathered some metal decking with the help of a bobcat to transport it to our work area. We found out that the metal decking was insufficient for our work and hence the \[Plaintiff\] told me to fetch more material from the material storage area, while he start laying the metal decking on the link way. Everything seems normal after I got back from gathering the material and both of us continue executing with the task given to us. At about 11 am, the injured worker approached me and told me that he felt pain on his left forearm. I asked him why and he told me that he fell and sustained an injury during the time I was away gathering the material. The \[Plaintiff\[ told me that while he was carrying a piece of metal decking on his left hand to lay it on the link way, he accidentally stepped on one of the unsecured metal decking which was already laid. The unsecured metal decking slipped, thus causing him to lose his balance and fell. During the process, the metal decking that the injured worker was carrying, landed on his left forearm. Statement was given accordingly from what I heard from the injured worker, as I did not witness the accident personally.

30     His second statement made on 27 October 2018 at about 9 am was as follows:

> On 24/10/2018 at 0900hrs I and \[the Plaintiff\] worked together. We doing linkway metal deck laying and tying. I am carrying the metal deck by bobcat and \[the Plaintiff\] metal fixing and tying. Linkway to metal deck carrying place 100m far. About 11 am \[the Plaintiff\] informed me he got injured left hand…I call safety supervisor immediately and bring him to our office. After safety officer send him clinic. But when he injury I do not know, he talk to me about 0930 hrs he got injury. And he continue working with me until 11 am.

31     During cross-examination, Mr Kawsar provided further details as to how the Works were done, as follows:

> (a)     The first piece of metal decking will be placed vertically somewhere in the middle across the breadth of the drain (as shown by the red line in the photo below). This would allow Mr Kawsar to place the first two metal deckings on the GI pipes. This first decking is a temporary one, and it will be removed subsequently.

![]([2022] SGDC 0023_Image/[2022] SGDC 0023_image2.png)

> (b)     Mr Kawsar would then stand on this vertical decking and lay the first and second metal deckings horizontally.

> (c)     He would then secure these two pieces of metal deckings to the GI pipes with a metal wire. The two metal deckings would then be secure and safe to walk over.

> (d)     After this, the vertical metal decking would be removed.

> (e)     Mr Kawsar would then cross the GI pipes and stand on the first two metal deckings that were already secured and install the rest of the metal deckings from that position.

32     Mr Kawsar disagreed with the Plaintiff’s description of how the Works were carried out. He also disagreed with the Plaintiff’s evidence that the Plaintiff’s task was only to lay the metal deckings while Mr Kawsar would be the one to tie the metal deckings to the GI pipes. Mr Kawsar’s evidence was that both he and the Plaintiff laid the metal deckings and tied them to the GI pipes.

33     Mr Kawsar said that after they started the Works at about 8:15 am or so, he only left the Plaintiff once, at around 9:15 am, to collect more metal deckings from the store. He did not leave a second time, and certainly did not leave to collect more metal deckings at around 11 am as asserted by the Plaintiff.

34     Mr Kawsar was asked what he meant when he said in his 27 October 2018 statement that “\[b\]ut when he injury I do not know, he talk to me about 0930 hrs he got injury”, as it appeared to contradict his evidence that the Plaintiff only told him of the injury at 11 am. However, Mr Kawsar said that that part of his statement was wrong, though he was not sure why his statement was written in that way. He maintained that the Plaintiff had only informed him of the injury at 11 am, and not 9:30 am.

## Mr Singh’s evidence

35     Mr Singh was the Plaintiff’s co-worker. Mr Singh knew the Plaintiff from the time they trained together in Chennai, India. They travelled together to Singapore to work for the Defendant. They stayed in the same room in the dormitory.

36     Mr Singh’s evidence can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     The Plaintiff, Mr Singh, Mr Kumar, Mr Maan Jagjit Singh and Mr Budh Singh had trained in Chennai together at the Goodwill Hi-Tech Training Centre (“Centre”). After they completed the training, they went back home but kept in touch with each other.

> (b)     All five received offers to work in Singapore. Save for Mr Kumar, everyone received an offer to work for the Defendant. Mr Kumar received an offer to work for BHCC Construction.

> (c)     All five travelled to Singapore. When in Singapore, Mr Singh, the Plaintiff and Mr Kumar met up several times. In one of the gatherings, Mr Maan Jagjit Singh and Mr Budh Singh attended but otherwise only Mr Kumar, the Plaintiff and Mr Singh attended the gatherings. At one or more of these gatherings, Mr Kumar had said the following:

>> (i)       That it was not easy to earn money in Singapore but that it was easy to get high compensation for injuries.

>> (ii)       He knew how to go about getting compensation and that he knew lawyers and agents who could help in making claims for compensation.

>> (iii)       He recommended that the Plaintiff and Mr Singh stage accidents which would result in some injuries which would allow them to claim compensation. He said the accident can be staged in many ways such as a fall from height or hitting fingers.

>> (iv)       Once the accident is staged, they should not bother to report to the safety officer and call the ambulance and go to the hospital. Instead, they should contact the lawyers or agents whose contacts Mr Kumar had.

>> (v)       They should stop communicating with their employers and let the lawyers handle the claims. Eventually, the lawyers will arrange for the injured worker to be sent back home and will arrange for legal action to be commenced against the employers and assist in recovering compensation.

>> (vi)       Mr Kumar had introduced Mr Singh and the Plaintiff to other workers who had staged accidents and made claims for compensation. The purpose was to convince Mr Singh and the Plaintiff that doing so was easy.

> (d)     Mr Kumar repeatedly urged the Plaintiff and Mr Singh to act fast and take the suggested course of action to get compensation.

> (e)     Mr Singh was uncomfortable with Mr Kumar’s suggestion but generally did not say anything to Mr Kumar. He would sometimes leave the discussions, leaving Mr Kumar and the Plaintiff to speak alone.

> (f)     At the dormitory, Mr Singh also overheard the Plaintiff talking on the phone with Mr Kumar about staging an accident. Mr Singh told the Plaintiff that what Mr Kumar was proposing was illegal and improper and that if the Plaintiff did anything illegal or improper, Mr Singh would end their friendship. The Plaintiff did not heed Mr Singh’s advice because he continued talking to and meeting up with Mr Kumar to discuss staging an accident.

> (g)     Mr Singh did not witness the Accident, but he was at the same worksite on that day. Around noon time, he found out that the Plaintiff had been involved in the Accident. It occurred to Mr Singh that the Plaintiff may have staged the accident.

> (h)     Mr Singh saw the Plaintiff on the evening of 24 October 2018 and 25 October 2018. On 26 October 2018, Mr Singh was told by the safety officer that the Plaintiff could not be found. He requested Mr Singh’s assistance in calling the Plaintiff and asking him to return. Mr Singh tried calling the Plaintiff numerous times, but the Plaintiff did not pick up his calls.

> (i)     On 30 October 2018, Mr Singh wrote out in his hand a statement about his suspicions that the Plaintiff’s accident was staged. The handwritten statement was subsequently typed out. The statement is as follows (“GS Statement”):

>> I am \[Mr Singh\] working as a general worker for \[the Defendant\] and I hereby provide my statement to my best knowledge without any influence or benefits.

>> On 20 July 2018, \[the Plaintiff\], \[Mr Mann Jagjit Singh\] and I came to Singapore to work for \[the Defendant\]. As we are waiting to attend \[the Course\] and exam, we met up with one of our friend \[Mr Kumar\] (previously working in BHCC) whom \[the Plaintiff\] gets to know him during BCA testing in India.

>> \[Mr Kumar\] told us that working in Singapore is very difficult and stressful and salary was not much and if you want to get more money, you should plan for injury case during work for big claims (huge compensation amount). In addition, he also provided \[the Plaintiff\] and me a lawyer contact for more information. I did not heed his advice as I wanted to continue to work in Singapore and abide the law.

>> After this meeting, \[the Plaintiff\] met with \[Mr Kumar\] on many more occasions. \[Mr Kumar\] also arranges a meeting with some people who already take the benefit of legal case. These people told us that after creating a legal case, MOM give them some special pass so they can work outside and company also give accommodation and food expenses.

>> After these 2 meetings, I told \[the Plaintiff\] and also warn him that if he do anything wrong or unlawful activity, I will end our friendship but \[the Plaintiff\] choose to ignore my advise and meet-up with other Bangladeshi and Indians whom will guide him in everything. His Indian agent also guides him on claims matter. I know because he mostly talks on the phone on this matter and I understand what he is saying.

>> I know \[the Plaintiff\] planning for this because he never sends money to his family. One Bangladeshi asked him to save money for lawyer and provide information / details on how to create a self-inflicted workplace injury for claim. Statement is true and to my best knowledge.

> (j)     Although Mr Singh made the GS Statement on 30 October 2018, he had informed the Defendant of his suspicions that the Plaintiff staged the accident as early as 27 October 2018. This is because the Defendant’s incident investigation and analysis report dated 27 October 2018 (“Incident Report”) mentions (without providing details) that “\[o\]ne of the injured fellow worker was come forward to the safety department, believing that this accident was planned.”

### Application to impeach Mr Singh’s credit

37     When Mr Singh was on the stand, Plaintiff Counsel asked him whether sometime in January 2019, he had made certain statements to the Plaintiff (the “**Statements**”). He denied making the Statements.

> Cross-examination of Mr Singh

> Q:    …Did you on a previous occasion, somewhere in January 2019, tell the Plaintiff that after you made the \[GS Statement\], the \[Defendant\] made you sit in the dormitory for 5 days and didn’t allow you to go to work and that you told \[Mr Maan Jagjit Singh\] that you were crying and your job was in danger. Did you or did you not tell the Plaintiff that?

> A:    To \[the Plaintiff\]?

> Q:    Yes.

> A:    No. I just talked with the \[inaudible\].

38     On hearing this denial, Plaintiff Counsel applied to impeach Mr Singh’s credibility, pursuant to ss 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act 1893 (“Evidence Act”). The application was premised on a video recording made by the Plaintiff of his conversation with Mr Singh sometime in January 2019 while they were at their dormitory (“Recording”). The Recording appeared to show that Mr Singh made the Statements. The Recording was not disclosed earlier as it was protected by litigation privilege. However, on hearing Mr Singh’s denial, Plaintiff Counsel stated that she had instructions to waive privilege over the Recording.

39     The salient parts of the Recording (which was originally in Punjabi but was translated and transcribed) were as follows:

>   
| 

Mr Singh:

 | 

Do you know what I said to him, that they have made me sit at home for 5 days. If they had said from that day that you sit at home, it was in my mind that I too was gone.

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

Company…

 |
| 

Mr Singh:

 | 

Yes sir.

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

…started to torture?

 |
| 

Mr Singh:

 | 

For me, the next day, after my statement, (they) told me do not come to work there. 5 days I did not go to work.

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

Is it…

 |
| 

Mr Singh:

 | 

I told Jagmeet. I am crying for myself, saying I…I said my job is in danger. He said what can I do, you do what you wish, its fine. What I want to do, I will do. (next short sentence is inaudible)

 |
| 

Plaintiff:

 | 

Then the company started giving threats.

 |

  
  

40     It is not disputed that Mr Singh’s reference to the “statement” is the GS Statement which he made on 30 October 2018.

#### Applicable legal principles

41     The Plaintiff relied on ss 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act, and in particular ss 157(c) and 147(2):

> **Impeaching credit of witness**

> **157**.    The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him or her:

>> (a)    by the evidence of persons who testify that they from their knowledge of the witness believe him or her to be unworthy of credit;

>> (b)    by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his or her evidence;

>> (**c**)     **by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his or her evidence which is liable to be contradicted.**

> **Cross-examination as to previous statements in writing**

> **147.**—(1)    A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him or her in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he or she is cross-examined, without such writing being shown to him or her or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict him or her by the writing, his or her attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him or her.

> (**2**)     **If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a previous oral statement made by him or her relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he or she is cross-examined and inconsistent with his or her present testimony, does not distinctly admit that he or she made such statement, proof may be given that he or she did in fact make it; but before such proof can be given, the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion, must be mentioned to the witness, and he or she must be asked whether or not he or she made such statement.**

> (3)    Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement is by virtue of this subsection admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by the person would be admissible.

> (4)    Where a person called as a witness in any proceedings is cross-examined on a document used by him or her to refresh his or her memory, that document may be made evidence in those proceedings.

> (5)    Where a document or any part of a document is received in evidence by virtue of subsection (4), any statement made in that document or part by the person using the document to refresh his or her memory is by virtue of that subsection admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him or her would be admissible.

42     The principles governing the impeachment of the credibility of witnesses under ss 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act are not controversial. In _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> (“_Kwang Boon Keong Peter_”), Yong Pung How CJ set out the principles as follows:

> (a)     The Evidence Act recognises a distinction between the credit of a witness and his credibility. The credit of a witness refers to his character and moral reliability whereas credibility of a witness refers to his mental capacity and power to be a witness of veracity. There is nonetheless a close relationship between the credit and credibility of a witness. To impeach a witness’ credit is to disparage or undermine his character and moral reliability and worth. The purpose of the impeachment of a witness’s credit is to undermine his credibility by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he is of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on. Thus, if a witness’s testimony is inconsistent with a previous statement made by him, that statement may be put to him in cross-examination to challenge his credit if the inconsistency will affect his credibility and likely standing with the trier of fact (at \[18\]-\[20\]).

> (b)     Whilst there is no explicit reference to s 147 in s 157, it is clear that the mechanics for the proof of the former inconsistent statement are found in s 147 of the Evidence Act (at \[21\]).

> (c)     A three-step approach is applicable when a party is applying to impeach a witness’ credit (at \[21\]):

>> (i)       First, on the request of either side, the court reads the former statement. If there is no serious discrepancy the court so rules and no time is wasted. The first necessity is to read it with the confident expectation that it will be different from the evidence but looking judicially to see whether the difference really is so serious as to suggest that the witness is unreliable. Differences may be divided into four classes: (1) minor differences, not amounting to discrepancies; (2) apparent discrepancies; (3) serious discrepancies; (4) material discrepancies. It is only the last two classes of differences which are sufficient to invoke the operation of s 147.

>> (ii)       Second, after the judge is of the opinion that the difference is so serious or material as probably to amount to a discrepancy affecting the credit of the witness, the court may permit the witness to be asked whether he made the alleged statement. If he denies having made it, then either the matter must be dropped or the document must be formally proved, by calling the writer or, if he is not available, by proving in some other way that the witness did make the statement.

>> (iii)       If the witness admits making the former statement, or is proved to have made it, then the two conflicting versions must be carefully explained to him, preferably by the court, and he must have a fair and full opportunity to explain the difference. If he can, then his credit is saved, though there may still be doubt as to the accuracy of his memory. This procedure is cumbersome and slow and therefore should not be used unless the apparent discrepancy is material to the issue.

> (d)     A successful impeachment of a witness’s credit under s 157 goes only to the weight of his oral testimony in court and not to its admissibility. It does not mean that all his oral testimony will be expunged (at \[24\]).

#### Parties’ arguments

43     Plaintiff Counsel argued that there was a serious or material discrepancy between Mr Singh’s evidence in court, when he denied making the Statements, and the Recording. Plaintiff Counsel urged that I immediately proceed to the second and third steps, _ie_ to allow Plaintiff Counsel to obtain confirmation from Mr Singh that he made the Statements and for him to be given an opportunity to explain the discrepancy.

44     Defendant Counsel however objected to this approach, and instead asked that the trial be adjourned for him to consider the Recording in greater detail. After all, he had never seen it before. He would also need to review the transcription and translation. He also wanted to make arguments relating to whether the Recording was even privileged in the first place, whether the Plaintiff was wrong to have withheld disclosure of the Recording and whether ss 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act even applied to civil proceedings.

45     I agreed with Defendant Counsel that the trial should be adjourned. If Mr Singh’s allegedly inconsistent statement was in writing and in English, it would have made sense to immediately proceed to the second and third steps (assuming the discrepancies were serious or material). In this case however, the allegedly inconsistent statement was made orally in Punjabi. Although Plaintiff Counsel had arranged for the Recording to be transcribed and translated, at the very least, Defendant Counsel should be given an opportunity to review the Recording to confirm that both the transcription and translation was accurate.

46     Consequently, I adjourned the trial for parties to make written submissions on the Plaintiff’s application. Parties exchanged written submissions and reply written submissions.

47     The Defendant argued that I should not allow the application for the following reasons:

> (a)     Relying heavily on _Property Alliance Group Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland plc (No 3)_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 WLR 3</span> (“_Property Alliance_”), the Defendant argued that the Recording was not protected by litigation privilege because it was not procured for the dominant purpose of litigation. It is not at all apparent that the conversation between the Plaintiff and Mr Singh was carried out with the dominant purpose of litigation. At best, it was a casual conversation about what happened after the Accident. Furthermore, the Recording was procured by deception.

> (b)     As the Recording was not protected by litigation privilege, and was clearly relevant, the Plaintiff had failed to comply with his discovery obligations. Furthermore, and assuming the Recording was not protected by litigation privilege, it is far too late now to produce the Recording because the Plaintiff has closed his case.

> (c)     Even if the Recording was protected by litigation privilege, it has not been properly listed in Schedule 1, Part 2 of the Plaintiff’s List of Documents.

> (d)     Even if the Recording was protected by litigation privilege, there has been no waiver of the privilege by the Plaintiff. Privilege belongs to the Plaintiff and only he, and not his counsel, can waive privilege.

> (e)     Even if the Recording was protected by litigation privilege, the impeachment process alluded to in ss 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act does not apply, for two reasons. First, the cases applying ss 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act are usually cases where formal statements (such as police statements) have been relied on as evidence of previously inconsistent statements. Sections 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act have thus far not been applied to situations where the previously inconsistent statements are in the form of secretly recorded oral conversations in a language other than English. Second, the proceedings are civil proceedings and the authorities on ss 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act have almost all been criminal, and not civil cases.

#### Ruling on whether there existed a serious or material discrepancy

48     After reviewing the parties’ submissions, I issued my ruling on 15 April 2021. My ruling was that that there existed a serious or material discrepancy between the Recording and Mr Singh’s evidence in court. I emphasised to parties that my ruling was a limited one. I was only deciding that there existed a serious or material discrepancy between Mr Singh’s evidence in court and the Recording, and so Mr Singh could be questioned on the Recording. I was _not_ deciding whether Mr Singh’s credit was impeached. That could only be done at the end of the trial, after taking into account all the evidence, including Mr Singh’s explanation for the inconsistency.

49     As for the Defendant’s other arguments, I came to the following conclusions:

> (a)     The Recording was protected by litigation privilege. It is not disputed that at or around January 2019, the Plaintiff was contemplating litigation against the Defendant. Generally speaking, when a party is contemplating litigation and is meeting potential witnesses and obtaining evidence from them, all those communications would be protected by litigation privilege. It is not necessary that the party inform the potential witness before obtaining such evidence that he is obtaining information for the purposes of litigation. The party may simply discuss with the witness generally what transpired, which appears to be what was captured in the Recording. The fact that the Recording may have been made surreptitiously also does not change anything. It is no different from a party recording what was said in writing at that time or after the discussion.

> (b)      _Property Alliance_ could be distinguished. In that case, a party had arranged a meeting with potential witnesses for the purposes of obtaining evidence for an intended litigation. However, the potential witnesses did not know this and was in fact told that the purpose of the discussion was to explore future business opportunities. The court found that there was a misrepresentation from the party, as the potential witnesses were _actively_ told that the purpose of the discussion was to discuss future business opportunities. But there was no such evidence here that the Plaintiff had misled or misrepresented Mr Singh in any way. On the contrary, it appeared that the Recording captured a somewhat casual discussion in their dormitory.

> (c)     Since the Recording was protected by litigation privilege, it need not be disclosed, even if it was relevant. There was also an effective waiver. I had no reason to believe that Plaintiff Counsel had not been properly instructed to waive privilege in these circumstances.

> (d)     I disagreed that the Recording had not been properly described in Schedule 1, Part 2 of the Plaintiff’s List of Documents. I considered the description to be sufficient. Anything more specific could have led to an implied waiver of the privilege over the Recording.

> (e)     Finally, ss 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act were applicable to civil proceedings. The Evidence Act generally applied to civil proceedings and there was nothing in ss 157 or 147 of the Evidence Act which suggested otherwise. The fact that the authorities on ss 157 and 147 of the Evidence Act were almost exclusively criminal cases did not mean that it was not possible to impeach the credit of witnesses in civil cases.

#### Mr Singh’s explanations for the inconsistency

50     Following on from my ruling, Mr Singh was shown the Recording. He confirmed that he was in the Recording and that he made the Statements. He was asked to explain the inconsistency. His explanation was two-fold, as follows:

> (a)     When he was asked in court whether he made the Statements, he denied it because he could not recall whether he did so since a lot of time had passed since January 2019.

> (b)     Whilst he did make the Statements to the Plaintiff in the Recording, the Statements were untrue. He therefore had lied to the Plaintiff. He did so because he did not want the Plaintiff to know that he was assisting the Defendant or that he was doing so voluntarily. He felt he had to do this because he was sharing a room with the Plaintiff and he was unsure what the Plaintiff might do if he found out the truth (_ie_, that he was voluntarily providing evidence to assist the Defendant). The relevant portions of Mr Singh’s evidence are set out below:

Questions from the Court

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, on the face of the video recording there is a contradiction between what is---what transpired in the video recording and what you said in Court in response to the questions from the Counsel.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So do you have an ex---explanation for that?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Sir, it may be a mistake, I---Chhote Lal because it’s a regular, I’m staying dormitory, Chhote Lal also staying there. So, it’s a social security also, 1 person doing illegal thing and I’m staying with him. **So, I cannot show myself that I’m a key witness of this case**, so I use a---for my friend and for this person also, this statement, that I am going Court for only---has translator, Chhote Lal what happened for company \[inaudible\]. **So,---whenever he talked for me, “Why you go my case? You are witness or something?” Then I talk him like this company do me or me are---I go just for your uh, information, who Chhote Lal, how this one. I never show myself as witness to company or my friend.**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay, let me just ask some further questions, so that I understand what you’re saying…\[Did\] the matters that you communicate to Chhote Lal where you said you were crying, you couldn’t---work for---5 days…

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**This one,--- never--- said, never said. The company never tortured me, never talked me. Even my statement, I take time to give statement to my company.**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, that means, and you need to correct me if \[I’m\] wrong on this, what you told Chhote Lal was not the truth.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes. It’s, uh, for my social security, Sir. We are living in sa---same room. Of my social security, I use these \[lies\].

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

What do you mean when you say “social security”?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Actually, Sir, we living in same dorm, Sir, same room…I’m every time, working only 9:00, coming---every time, I stay with this person. He---if do 1 thing wrong, maybe he second, also do. So I do not want to lost my future in Singapore. If he fight or something do with me, then I also loss---if I any injury or and if I tell him police coming, obviously, Sir, fighting---fighting how my company also talking this 2 person ah, no need then what I do. **So, I---for my safe side, I never show as---me as witness.**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, does that mean that when you say “I never show me as witness,” when that discussion was happening in January 2019 with Chhote Lal, did you---what? Did Chhote Lal think you were a witness or you told him you’re a witness?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

He suspect like this, Sir.

#### Whether Mr Singh’s credit should be impeached

51     I accepted Mr Singh’s explanations for the inconsistency. In relation to the first explanation, it must be remembered that by the time Mr Singh came on the stand on 5 March 2021 to give evidence, more than 2 years had passed since his conversation with the Plaintiff. The conversation was a casual one and it is not at all surprising that Mr Singh could not immediately recall what he said.

52     In relation to the second explanation, by the time the Plaintiff spoke to Mr Singh in January 2019, the Plaintiff knew he would be returning to India shortly. He in fact returned to India sometime in January 2019. From Mr Singh’s point of view, the Plaintiff was someone who had no qualms doing something illegal or immoral by staging the Accident. It was not unreasonable for Mr Singh to think that if the Plaintiff knew that he was cooperating with the Defendant, he would take steps that might jeopardise Mr Singh’s ability to remain in Singapore. Mr Singh gave the example of the Plaintiff starting a fight with him which could involve the police. This could very well lead to criminal charges and Mr Singh being repatriated back to India. This would not really affect the Plaintiff since he was returning to India shortly, but it would significantly affect Mr Singh. Mr Singh’s explanation that he lied to the Plaintiff, to not lead the Plaintiff to think that he was assisting the Defendant or assisting them voluntarily, was logical and understandable.

53     I would add that by January 2019, the Plaintiff probably knew (and not just suspected) that Mr Singh was providing evidence to the Defendant that the Plaintiff may have staged the Accident. It is likely that the Objection Report (described at \[57\] below) had either been provided to the Plaintiff or its contents described to him. Indeed, during his cross-examination, the Plaintiff acknowledged that in his interviews at MOM, he was specifically asked about his relationship with Mr Kumar. MOM would not have been able to ask such questions without the Objection Report. In light of this, Mr Singh’s fear that the Plaintiff suspected his involvement in helping the Defendant could not be said to be overstated. That fear, and the fear of the Plaintiff’s reaction if he discovered the truth that Mr Singh was helping the Defendant _voluntarily_, drove him to lie, letting the Plaintiff believe that he had no choice but to help the Defendant because otherwise his “job \[was\] in danger.”

54     Since I accepted Mr Singh’s explanations for the inconsistency between his evidence in court and what he said in the Recording, there are no grounds to impeach his credit and his credit remains intact.

## Mr Low’s evidence

55     Mr Low was the Defendant’s work safety and health coordinator. He was at the worksite on the day of the Accident but did not witness the Accident. He testified that the Plaintiff had attended safety courses and that the Defendant generally had a safe work culture, pointing to the following:

> (a)     The Plaintiff had attended a safety orientation course before starting work with the Defendant.

> (b)     The Plaintiff had attended a worker’s first day safety induction prior to commencing work at the worksite. The Plaintiff also attended a risk assessment and safe work procedure briefing. During this briefing, the Plaintiff was briefed on workplace safety, risk assessment and safe work procedure.

> (c)     The Plaintiff (and all other workers) attended daily tool box meetings. At these meetings, the workers were reminded to follow safety rules and regulations at all times. The workers were also constantly reminded not to engage in any unsafe acts, that they should report to their supervisors if they observed any unsafe working conditions or if the work they were tasked to do was unsafe. A tool box meeting was conducted on the day of the Accident.

> (d)     The Plaintiff was issued personal protective equipment, comprising of a safety helmet, safety belt, hand gloves, protective goggles, face shield, ear plugs and protective footwear.

56     On the day of the Accident, and after Mr Low learnt of the Plaintiff’s injury, he brought the Plaintiff to a hospital.

57     In Mr Low’s AEIC, he had annexed two documents which were prepared by Mr Mick Zheng, the Defendant’s work safety and health officer. Mr Zheng however had left the Defendant’s employment after the Accident. The two documents prepared by Mr Zheng were the Incident Report and an objection report dated 23 November 2018 (“Objection Report”). The Incident Report set out the description of the Accident and its causes and annexed statements from Mr Low, Mr Singh and Mr Kawsar. The Objection Report was a document filed by the Defendant with MOM providing information to support the Defendant’s position that the Accident was staged.

58     The Plaintiff argued that the Incident Report should be admitted into evidence notwithstanding that the maker of document, Mr Zheng, was not called. The Plaintiff argued that although it was hearsay evidence, it was admissible pursuant to s 32(1)(b) of the Evidence Act (_ie_, the business records exception). However, given that the Defendant too wanted the Incident Report admitted into evidence, there was no need to rely on s 32(1)(b) as the Incident Report could be admitted pursuant to s 32(1)(k), which provides that hearsay evidence can be admitted by agreement.

59     However, the Plaintiff was silent on the Objection Report. This is not surprising given that, unlike the Incident Report which provided support to the Plaintiff’s case (as it was prepared on the premise that the Accident was not staged), the Objection Report was largely unfavourable to the Plaintiff. The Defendant urged that I admit the Objection Report into evidence, though the weight to be given was subject to my assessment and discretion. I could not agree for two reasons. First, the document did not obviously fall within any of the hearsay exceptions in s 32 of the Evidence Act. Second, Mr Low’s evidence was that although Mr Zheng had left the Defendant after the Accident, he was subsequently re-employed by the Defendant and at the time Mr Low gave evidence, he was the Defendant’s employee. Consequently, the Defendant would have had no difficulty calling Mr Zheng to give evidence. The Objection Report therefore was not admitted into evidence. Notwithstanding this, I observed that the contents of the Objection Report have largely been confirmed or corroborated by the Defendant’s witnesses.

## Whether the Plaintiff staged the Accident

60     It is never an easy task to determine whether an accident was staged. The difficulty here was more acute because there was no objective, direct evidence that supports either party’s position. My task is therefore to consider Mr Singh’s evidence together with other surrounding circumstances and weigh that against the Plaintiff’s evidence.

### Mr Singh’s evidence

61     The Plaintiff urged me to reject Mr Singh’s evidence, arguing firstly that Mr Singh’s credit should be impeached because he gave evidence that was inconsistent with the Recording and his explanations for the inconsistency were not believable. Secondly, Mr Singh was concerned about his job and therefore when pressured by the Defendant to lie, he “had every reason to \[do\] \[the Defendant’s\] bidding”.

62     I rejected the Plaintiff’s argument and accepted Mr Singh’s evidence, the essence of which was that the Plaintiff had discussed extensively with Mr Kumar about staging an accident and claiming compensation. Mr Singh’s evidence was supported by two contemporaneous pieces of evidence – the Incident Report dated 27 October 2018, which had stated that “\[o\]ne of the injured fellow worker has come forward to the safety department, believing that this accident was planned”, and the GS Statement.

63     For the reasons set out at \[51\] to \[54\] above, I also accepted Mr Singh’s explanations for the inconsistency between his evidence in court and what he said in the Recording. Mr Singh’s credit was not impeached, and his credit remained intact.

64     I do not accept that the Defendant had pressured Mr Singh to lie or give false evidence. Mr Singh confirmed this to be the case, confirming in court that he was not pressured to give evidence and the Defendant did not stop him from going to work.

65     More importantly, the objective evidence points to Mr Singh providing his evidence freely and voluntarily. It must be remembered that Mr Singh had first informed the Defendant that the Accident might have been staged on or before 27 October 2018 because it was referred to in the Incident Report (which was dated on 27 October 2018). Mr Singh then followed up on 30 October 2018 with a handwritten account of why he thought the Accident may be staged, reciting the Plaintiff’s various discussions with Mr Kumar (_ie_, the GS Statement).

66     The Plaintiff’s argument is that what Mr Singh had said in the Recording is true, and that meant that the Defendant put pressure on Mr Singh by not allowing him to come to work for 5 days _after_ he gave the GS Statement. However, it is _not_ the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant had pressured Mr Singh to prepare the GS Statement. The Plaintiff’s position is that pressure was placed after the GS Statement was prepared. Since Mr Singh’s evidence in his AEIC is broadly aligned with the GS Statement, and if there was no allegation that Mr Singh was coerced by the Defendant to prepare the GS Statement, then there is really no basis to assert that the Defendant coerced Mr Singh to “do the Defendant’s bidding” and give false evidence. If the Defendant had _not_ pressured Mr Singh to prepare the GS Statement, why would they need to pressure him to come to court and give evidence that was broadly aligned with the GS Statement? It makes no sense for the Defendant to do that.

### Other circumstantial evidence

67     Although I have accepted Mr Singh’s evidence that the Plaintiff and Mr Kumar had talked about staging an accident and claiming compensation, it does not necessarily follow that the Accident was staged. This is because Mr Singh was not present when the Accident allegedly occurred and could not say either way whether the Accident happened. It was also possible that the Plaintiff’s discussions with Mr Kumar did not lead anywhere and that the Plaintiff’s plan to stage an accident was abandoned.

68     However, for the following reasons, I am compelled to conclude that the Accident was staged.

#### Plaintiff’s refusal to address the Defendant’s detailed allegations regarding his relationship with Mr Kumar

69     Although the Defendant at paragraph 5 its Defence made very specific allegations about the Plaintiff’s contact and communications with Mr Kumar, the Plaintiff barely addressed those allegations. The only thing the Plaintiff said in his AEIC in response to the allegations was the following:

> I understand from my solicitors that the Defendants have alleged in their Defence that there was no accident at the Premises and that my claim for injuries were deliberate, self-inflicted, and/or created for the purposes of making claims. I wish to aver that their allegations are wholly untrue.

70     I found the Plaintiff’s failure to engage in any meaningful way with the Defendant’s detailed allegations (which formed the thrust of the defence) to be puzzling. I would have expected the Plaintiff to comment on his relationship with Mr Kumar, and whether the various discussions happened. The Plaintiff did not do this at all. The Plaintiff’s failure to engage with the Defendant’s averments could not be readily explained and was suspicious to say the least.

#### Plaintiff’s refusal to acknowledge his relationship with Mr Kumar

71     Second, the Plaintiff denied having ever met with Mr Kumar in Singapore before the Accident. The Plaintiff says he met Mr Kumar only after the Accident. The Plaintiff’s evidence contradicts Mr Singh’s evidence that the Plaintiff had met with Mr Kumar several times before the Accident. I preferred Mr Singh’s evidence. It seemed to me more likely that the Plaintiff would have met with Mr Kumar and others whom he knew from Chennai where they trained. As someone new in Singapore, the Plaintiff (like many other foreign workers new to Singapore) would be more comfortable spending his free time with people he knew, such as Mr Kumar. The Plaintiff therefore was not being honest about his relationship with Mr Kumar and his refusal to even acknowledge having met Mr Kumar in Singapore before the Accident was inexplicable unless he wanted to distance himself from Mr Kumar.

#### Plaintiff’s disappearance and refusal to communicate with the Defendant after the Accident

72     The Plaintiff’s actions after the Accident followed the _modus operandi_ suggested by Mr Kumar, and which Mr Singh alluded to his AEIC. Mr Singh said the following:

> \[Mr Kumar\] stated that the accident can be staged in many ways such as falling from a height and/or hitting the fingers at the worksite resulting in some injuries. Once the accident has been staged, we should not bother to report to the Safety Officer and call the ambulance and go to hospital. Thereafter, we were advised to contact the lawyers or the agents whose numbers he had given to us. **After that, we would stop communicating with the employers and let the lawyers handle the claims.** \[emphasis in bold added\]

73     The Plaintiff did indeed stop communicating with the Defendant very soon after the Accident. Mr Zheng, Mr Low and Mr Singh all tried to contact him, but he refused to take their calls. Furthermore, the Plaintiff disappeared without explanation (since he could not be found at the dormitory or the worksite) for several days after the Accident and the Defendant filed a police report on 29 October 2018 about the Plaintiff’s disappearance. The Plaintiff’s disappearance, refusal to respond to calls and refusal to cooperate with the Defendant is the _modus operandi_ that Mr Kumar had suggested, after staging an accident.

74     The Plaintiff explained that he stayed away from the dormitory for several days after the Accident and stayed with a friend during that period because he was in pain and needed help with buying food and with daily activities such as going to the bathroom and putting on clothes. He said that he would not have received help from the Defendant or his co-workers if he had stayed in the dormitory. I disbelieved this explanation for two reasons. First, the Plaintiff could not provide _any_ details about the identity of this friend who had helped him. He could not recall his friend’s name even though he was apparently someone who had lived in the same village as the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff did not even have his contact number and never asked for it.

75     Second, the Plaintiff’s reasons for staying with this friend, are thin. The Plaintiff says he needed help to buy food and to go to the bathroom. And yet, the Plaintiff acknowledged that after the Accident, he had no trouble buying food and provisions for himself. The Plaintiff also acknowledged that he could move around and visit the hospital and MOM and travel on the MRT all by himself without any help. It seems to me somewhat contradictory if the Plaintiff required help with daily activities such as wearing clothes and going to the bathroom and yet had no issues travelling alone on public transport.

#### Plaintiff’s refusal to cooperate with the Defendant in its investigations

76     Quite apart from the fact that the Plaintiff’s actions followed the _modus operandi_ suggested by Mr Kumar, he also benefited from this as it prevented the Defendant from fully investigating the Accident and allowed the Plaintiff not to be bound to any one version of the Accident. Because of the Plaintiff’s non-cooperation, the Defendant could not obtain a detailed statement from him and there was no re-enactment of the Accident. The failure to fully investigate meant that the Defendant could not test the Plaintiff’s account of the Accident. Furthermore, as there were no eyewitnesses to the Accident, the Plaintiff was therefore free to alter details of the Accident. Indeed, the Plaintiff’s account of the Accident in his Statement of Claim filed on 12 April 2019 is markedly different from his account in his Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) filed 10 months later on 11 February 2020. In his Statement of Claim, he described the Accident as follows:

> 5.    In the course of his employment on 24 October 2018 (the material day), the Plaintiff was instructed to transport metal deckings from one part of the worksite to another designated site for other workers to lay and tie the metal deckings for the purposes of setting up a temporary work platform above a drain.

> 6.    While the Plaintiff was in the process of transporting the metal deckings to the designated site, **he stepped onto a metal decking which was not secured by the other workers. As a result, the unsecured metal decking flipped upwards and hit his forearm, he slipped and fell into the drain together with the unsecured metal decking and he thereby sustained injuries.** \[emphasis in bold added\]

77     In his Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1), the Plaintiff described the Accident as follows:

> 5.    In the course of his employment on 24 October 2018 (the material day), the Plaintiff was instructed to lay metal deckings above the G.I. pipers over a drain at the Premises.

> 6.    The Plaintiff had earlier laid a few metal deckings as instructed. **The Plaintiff was walking on the metal deckings he had laid earlier and was going to further lay down another 2 metal deckings he was carrying on his left shoulder. However, before he could lay the 2 metal deckings, his foot slipped on an unsecured metal decking and he fell backwards hitting his back against the G.I. pipes. During his fall, the Plaintiff inadvertently let go of the 2 metal deckings that he was carrying. One of the metal deckings hit his hand/arm.** The Plaintiff sustained personal injuries as a result. \[emphasis in bold added\]

78     The Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) was filed about 16 months after the Accident. I highly doubt that the Plaintiff’s recollection of the Accident would be better 16 months after the Accident, rather than 6 months after the Accident when he filed his Statement of Claim. Significant details which were pleaded earlier, such as the unsecured metal decking flipping upwards and hitting his arm have been abandoned. Entirely new details such as the Plaintiff carrying 2 metal deckings on his left shoulder were added.

79     Whilst I generally do not think that anything conclusive can be derived solely from a party’s departure from his previous pleadings, taken together with the other matters I have described above (in particular, the Plaintiff’s refusal to communicate with the Defendant after the Accident, his disappearance and his failure to cooperate with the Defendant to provide a statement or conduct a re-enactment), I considered that this departure corroborated the Defendant’s defence that the Accident was staged.

#### The Accident could not have occurred at 11 am but instead occurred much earlier

80     The timing of the Accident suggested that it was staged. The Plaintiff’s evidence is that he injured his arm at around 11 am or so, when Mr Kawsar was not around as had left to collect metal deckings. Mr Kawsar’s evidence is that he left the Plaintiff only once, when he went to collect metal deckings at around 9:15 am to 9:20 am, and returned by 9:40 am. He did not collect metal deckings a second time before the Plaintiff informed him that he had injured his arm at around 11 am or so. If both the Plaintiff and Mr Kawsar are correct, then Mr Kawsar would have been present when the Accident occurred sometime at 11 am. But both the Plaintiff and Mr Kawsar accept that Mr Kawsar did not witness the Accident. Consequently, if Mr Kawsar is correct, then the Accident must have happened at some other time, and not around 11 am as asserted by the Plaintiff.

81     I accepted Mr Kawsar’s evidence that he left the Plaintiff and went to collect the metal deckings only once, at around 9:15 am to 9:20 am, and returned by 9:40 am, and that he did not collect metal deckings a second time. There was no reason for Mr Kawsar to lie about the inconsequential fact of how many times he had collected the metal deckings. If he had gone to collect metal deckings a second time, there was no reason to hide this fact. Mr Kawsar’s evidence was also corroborated by his first statement made on 26 October 2018 at about 1:30 pm where he said this:

> On 24th Oct 2018 at about 09:30hrs, the \[Plaintiff\] and myself were tasked by our supervisor to lay metal decking on the link way. **Both of us gathered some metal decking with the help of a bobcat to transport it to our work area. We found out that the metal decking was insufficient for our work and hence the \[Plaintiff\] told me to fetch more material from the material storage area, while he start laying the metal decking on the link way. Everything seems normal after I got back from gathering the material and both of us continue executing with the task given to us. At about 11 am, the injured worker approached me and told me that he felt pain on his left forearm. I asked him why and he told me that he fell and sustained an injury during the time I was away gathering the material.** The \[Plaintiff\[ told me that while he was carrying a piece of metal decking on his left hand to lay it on the link way, he accidentally stepped on one of the unsecured metal decking which was already laid. The unsecured metal decking slipped, thus causing him to lose his balance and fell. During the process, the metal decking that the injured worker was carrying, landed on his left forearm. Statement was given accordingly from what I heard from the injured worker, as I did not witness the accident personally. \[emphasis in bold added\]

82     In the above statement made soon after the Accident, Mr Kawsar only mentioned having to collect metal deckings once, and not twice. As I accepted Mr Kawsar’s evidence that he collected metal deckings only once and had returned by 9:40 am and was with the Plaintiff up until 11 am or so when the Plaintiff informed him of the pain in his arm, it follows from this that the Plaintiff was not being honest when he said that the Accident occurred at around 11 am because if it did, Mr Kawsar would have witnessed it. The Accident, if it occurred at all, must have occurred much earlier, between 9:15 am to 9:40 am, when Mr Kawsar was away. If a genuine Accident had occurred during this period, there was no good reason to delay informing Mr Kawsar of the Accident immediately on his return. If the Accident had not occurred as pleaded, and the injury to the Plaintiff’s arm was self-inflicted, then that would explain the Plaintiff’s delay in notifying Mr Kawsar.

#### Plaintiff’s description of how he undertook the Works was improbable in several respects

83     I accepted Mr Kawsar’s evidence as to how the Works were done. I thought that the Plaintiff’s description of how the Works were done to be improbable in several respects and bordered on being incredible. The improbability of the Plaintiff’s description of how he undertook the Works provided further support for my finding that the Accident was in fact staged.

84     First, laying the metal deckings while standing on the narrow GI pipes was neither safe nor efficient. It is not safe because the Plaintiff would have to balance himself on the GI pipes while he bends or crouches down to place the metal decking. It is not efficient because someone would have to stand at the other end to make sure the metal decking is properly placed on the GI pipes. It would be difficult for the Plaintiff to lay the metal decking alone without help from someone at the other end. Mr Kawsar’s description of how the metal deckings were laid was safer and made more sense. It was safer because initially Mr Kawsar would be standing on the temporary metal decking placed across the drain and not on the GI pipes. It could also be done alone because it would be easier to ensure each metal decking was placed properly if Mr Kawsar was standing in the middle, rather than standing on either side. Subsequently, after the first two metal deckings were laid, tied and therefore secured, it made sense to work from those two secured deckings to install the rest of the deckings. Unlike the Plaintiff’s description of the Works, Mr Kawsar’s description of the Works did not require anyone to be standing on the GI pipes for any long period of time (Mr Kawsar says one only needs to navigate the GI pipes to get to the secured metal deckings). More importantly, it did not require anyone to be standing on the GI pipes while laying the metal decking. When a worker is laying the metal decking, he would have to bend or crouch down and there is a high risk that he would lose his balance, on account of the heavy weight of the metal decking. Standing on narrow GI pipes while doing so simply increased the risk that he would lose his balance and fall.

85     Second, it was reckless for the Plaintiff to carry two long heavy metal deckings on his shoulder, which together would have weighed between 24 kg to 30 kg, while standing on the GI pipes or on the unsecured metal decking. There was no good reason, not only to carry _two_ metal deckings at once but to place them on his shoulder since carrying them in such a way made it easier for the Plaintiff to lose his balance. It must be remembered that the metal deckings were placed close to where the Works were done, and the Plaintiff did not have to carry the metal deckings over long distances. Consequently, carrying the metal deckings over his shoulder did not bring any obvious benefit over simply carrying them over his side. Carrying them on his shoulder however increased the risk that he would lose his balance.

86     Third, it was highly improbable that the Plaintiff, while carrying two metal deckings on his shoulder, needed not only to balance himself while standing on the GI pipes and unsecured metal decking, but also had to bring the metal deckings down and lay them down. Effectively, the Plaintiff had to remove one metal decking from his shoulder, bend or crouch down to lay it down, making sure at all times that the decking properly lay on the GI pipes at both ends (without any help), while at the same time still carry the other metal decking on his shoulder and making sure it does not slip or fall. I cannot comprehend how the Plaintiff could have done this, or why he could have thought this was a logical way to carry out the Works. Even if he was laying two deckings at a time, there was still a high risk of losing his balance given that he would be bending or crouching down to place two metal deckings which weighed at least 24 kg, while standing on the narrow GI pipes.

87     Therefore, while Mr Singh’s evidence was not conclusive, his evidence and the other circumstantial evidence I have described above led me to conclude that the Accident was staged.

## Other arguments

88     Given my finding that the Accident was staged, it was not necessary for me to decide the further issues (see \[6\] above). However, as parties had made full arguments, I set out my views briefly below.

### Breach of the Scaffold Regulations was not pleaded

89     The Plaintiff was not entitled to rely on the breach of the Scaffold Regulations because he had not pleaded it. This was a conspicuous omission, especially considering the Plaintiff’s plea that specific provisions of the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 and the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations were breached. Even though a party generally does not have to plead points of law, the Plaintiff’s failure to plead the Scaffold Regulations deprived the Defendant of an opportunity to address through its factual witnesses the issue of whether the Works was something that could fairly be described as scaffold works.

### In any event, there was no breach of the Scaffold Regulations

90     The Works in any event did not involve the erection of a scaffold. I accepted the Defendant’s argument that the Scaffold Regulations only applied to scaffolds that were more than 4 metres in height (see r 4(2)(c) of the Scaffold Regulations). As the drain over which the metal deckings were placed was clearly less than 4 metres in height (the Plaintiff’s evidence was that it was less than one metre), the provisions of the Scaffold Regulations did not apply to the Works.

### Plaintiff’s way of going about the Works was patently unsafe

91     The way the Plaintiff was going about the Works was so obviously reckless and dangerous. It would have been apparent to the Plaintiff that it was patently unsafe (see \[83\] to \[86\] above). Consequently, I do not think the Defendant can be responsible if as a result of such reckless and dangerous actions, the Plaintiff was injured. Therefore, even if the Accident was not staged, I would have found the Plaintiff to be wholly liable.

### Defendant’s failure to adduce other evidence

92     For completeness, I address the Plaintiff’s argument that the Defendant could have adduced corroborative evidence to support its case. For example, the WhatsApp chats which Mr Singh referred to in his AEIC could have been produced. Evidence from Mr Maan Jagjit Singh and Mr Budh Singh, two individuals who were present during some of the discussions between the Plaintiff and Mr Kumar, could have been adduced as well. Mr Maan Jagjit Singh and Mr Budh Singh were the Defendant’s employees.

93     However, the Defendant decides how it wishes to run its case. If it is confident that it can succeed with the evidence it has, there is no need to produce corroborative evidence. In this case, I accepted Mr Singh’s evidence that, prior to the Accident, the Plaintiff had discussed extensively with Mr Kumar about staging an accident and claiming compensation. Furthermore, it was open to the Plaintiff to subpoena Mr Maan Jagjit Singh and Mr Budh Singh, if he thought their evidence would contradict Mr Singh’s evidence. The fact that he chose not to provides a clue as to what he thought Mr Maan Jagjit Singh and Mr Budh Singh were likely to say if called to give evidence.

## Conclusion

94     For the reasons set out above, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim, with costs payable to the Defendant.

95     After informing parties of my decision on 2 November 2021, I asked parties to file brief written submissions on costs. After reviewing those submissions, I fixed costs at $19,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed plus GST (if applicable), to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant.
