### District Judge Terence Tay:

## Introduction

1       Left unchecked, corruption is a problem that can spread like a contagion and debilitate the constitution of an orderly society. In Singapore, strong political will and strict enforcement have been instrumental in significantly curbing corruption in both the private and public sectors.[^1] However, “we are under no illusions that we have permanently and completely solved the problem. Corruption is driven by human nature and greed.”[^2]

2       The accused persons in the present case, Mr Yee Kok Siong @ Jensen (“**Jensen**”) and Mr Tan Bee Song @ Edmund @ Ah Tan (“**Tan**”), had claimed trial to charges of bribery with the nefarious purpose of procuring the wrongful arrest of one Hoon Tian Jie (“**Hoon**”):

3       The prescribed punishment for each of the charges was up to 5 years’ imprisonment and/or up to $100,000 fine.

4       At the end of the joint trial of Jensen and Tan, I found that the Prosecution had proved its case against each of them beyond reasonable doubt and I convicted Jensen and Tan of the respective charges against them.

5       Before Tan was sentenced, he pleaded guilty to a charge that he, on 30 May 2015, having possession of certain information which was obtained in contravention of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213, Rev Ed 2012) (the “**OSA**”), communicated the said information to an individual to whom Tan was not authorised to communicate the said information, an offence under section 5(1)(c) read with section 5(1)(i) and punishable under section 17(2) of the OSA (“**TC3**”).

6       Tan also consented to another charge under section 5(2) and punishable under section 17(2) of the OSA being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

7       Both Jensen and Tan have no relevant antecedents.

8       I sentenced Jensen to 2 months’ imprisonment for JC1 and sentenced Tan globally to 4 months’ imprisonment based on the following individual sentences:

9       Jensen and Tan had filed appeals against their convictions and sentences. I allowed their applications for a stay of execution of the sentences and bail pending appeal.[^6]

11     As Tan had alleged that he had given his statements (_ie._ Tan’s 1st Statement and Tan’s 2nd Statement) involuntarily as a result of _inducement_ and _promise_,[^7] an ancillary hearing was held to determine the issue.

## The ancillary hearing

#### Tan’s allegations

12     The main thrusts of Tan’s allegations centred on the statement recording process:

>   
| 

In relation to Tan’s 1st Statement: [^8]

 |
| 

A

 | 

And a while later at around 15 minutes to 20 minutes, he returned back to the room whereby together with another officer---male officer.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Who is this male officer?

 |
| 

A

 | 

As I really couldn’t recall and I could recall that this male officer is roughly around 35 to 40 plus years old. And I remember that he’s quite fierce. He was---he was standing at the side of the table whereby IO Lin was just in front of me. And again, he asked me what do I---what do I have done with Shukor this time around. So I told him that Shukor is my ex-colleague and, uh, so far we have done nothing. So the standing officer did ask me, “So last few day did you all met up?” I told him that, “Well, we did met up for some chit-chatting at Shukor house apartment roadside. From there I---I---I told the officer that, “Well, it just a chit-chatting and---and---and---and just asked about one another self-being.” So at one point of time, the I---IO---standing IO was quite angry at me and saying that, “Why are you beating up---around the bush?” Then used 4-letter word on me and asking me to tell the truth. I told them---I told him---I told both of the officer that well, what I’m telling is the truth. Then after that, the standing IO was angry and was using 4-letter word on me, saying that, “Well, you and Shukor are friends and colleagues---ex-colleagues. If there’s a money involved, it’s not---not, uh---not, uh, big---big issue.” So from there I did told him that, “Well, Shukor did wanted to borrow some money from me few days ago.” And just coincidentally, I---I passed by his house and went there to meet him for some chit-chat. And then a while later, the IO---standing IO left the room and I continued to give my statement.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What after---after the---what you call the standing IO left the room? Can you tell the Court what happened?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I continued to give my statement for a few hours and at one point of time, I did---ask IO Lin that---I did told IO Lin that I’m hungry and, uh, what time will the dinner serve? And IO Lin told me that, uh, “Well, you---you---you finish up the statement and, uh, the dinner will serve later.” So roughly, it take around an hour later, my dinner was served.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

After dinner was served, what happened?

 |
| 

A

 | 

After dinner was served, I continued to give statement. Continued my statement, IO Lin continued to record my statement and I think it last another 2, 3 hours again. And when the statement conclude, IO Lin went out the room and come back with the hard copy of the statement together with my phone.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What happened thereafter?

 |
| 

A

 | 

IO Lin asked me to read the statement. As I was too tired and too stressed out, I have browsed the statement and just signed the statement. I did not make any amendments on the statement.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Why not?

 |
| 

A

 | 

As I’m too tired to read.

 |
| 

In relation to Tan’s 2nd Statement:[^9]

 |
| 

A

 | 

I wanted to amend the statement on paragraph 14. However, uh, IO Lin did told me that, “Well, that is not serious and, uh, do not need to amend.” As such I did not amend and, uh, he continued to---to record the statement from me.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

With the subject matter of the amending, how many times did you ask IO Lin to amend?

 |
| 

A

 | 

What I could recall is that I---I have asked more than 1 time.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And to the best of your recollection, what did he say to you about your request to amend?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He told me that this is not serious and---and---and---and do not need to amend.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Eventually in the 2nd statement, the further statement, what were or what was the amendment?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I couldn’t recall, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And the particular part that you wanted to amend in paragraph 14, was it amended?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It was not amended, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

#### The Prosecution’s evidence

13     The Prosecution called PSI Lin and DHI Chew as witnesses for the ancillary hearing.

14     According to PSI Lin, there was no other investigation officer in the interview room (the “**Unknown IO**”) throughout the recording of Tan’s 1st Statement and there was nothing to suggest that Tan was not fit to give the statement.

15     Based on PSI Lin’s detailed account of the chronology of events from Tan’s arrest to the recording of Tan’s 1st Statement, nothing of significance happened that could suggest the application of any threat, inducement or promise:[^10]

Q

 | 

Do you know who was interviewing Tan Bee Song on the 3rd of August 2016?

 |
| 

A

 | 

(pause - 00:00:08) If I remember correctly, it’s my colleague, uh, Lin Jue Hai.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Were you aware of anyone aside from Lin Jue Hai going into the interview room in which Mr. Tan Bee Song was on the 3rd of August 2016?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, not aware.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And were you aware of any threats, inducements or promises being done to Mr. Tan Bee Song on the 3rd of August 2016?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Not aware also.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now I ask you to look into the records available to you to determine whether anyone had gone into this interview room on the 3rd of August where Tan Bee Song was. Could you tell the Court what you found?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I went through the records. There were no records of entry that, uh, someone went to Tan Bee Song’s interview room except for his interviewer Lin Jue Hai if I remember correctly. It’s Lin Jue Hai.

17     Similarly, PSI Lin’s evidence of how he recorded Tan’s 2nd Statement did not disclose any form of threat inducement or promise that could have rendered the statement involuntary:[^12]

#### Court’s findings

18     In relation to Tan’s 1st Statement, the gravamen of Tan’s allegations of inducement and promise was his brief interaction with the Unknown IO during the recording of the statement.

19     In this regard, I was not satisfied that the Unknown IO existed and that the Unknown IO had spoken to Tan in the interview room during the recording of Tan’s 1st Statement.

20     First, Tan and his defence counsel appeared to disagree as to who the Unknown IO could be.

21     During the cross-examination of DHI Chew, Tan’s defence counsel had suggested that DHI Chew was the Unknown IO:[^13]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

… I suggest to you that you went to see Tan Bee Song in the room---interview room.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I didn’t.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And I suggest to you that you were the one who spoke to him in the interview room.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I didn’t.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And I’m also suggesting to you that you had a conversation with Mr. Tan Bee Song in the interview room on the 3rd of August 2016.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I cannot recall speaking to Tan Bee Song on the 3rd of August 2016.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

These are my instructions, okay. I’m instructed that on the 3rd of August 2016, you went into the interview room where Tan Bee Song was kept in custody and you shouted at him.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I did not.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And I’m also suggesting to you that you used 4-letter word on him during your conversation with Tan Bee Song.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I did not.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

I further suggest to you that either IO Lin or yourself spoke to Tan Bee Song in the interview room stating words to the effect that Shukor and \[Tan\] were ex-colleague.

 |
| 

…

 | 

… Money transaction is not a big deal. You agree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Definitely, I did not, uh, say such words to Tan Bee Song but if the Counsel question is either me or my colleague Jue Hai---

 |

  
  

22     On the other hand, Tan had maintained throughout his testimony that he could not identify the Unknown IO. During cross-examination, he reiterated that DHI Chew was not the Unknown IO:[^14]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

I must confess I’m a bit surprised by this, Mr. Tan. Because earlier when Mr. Chew was on---in the witness box, what was suggested to him was that he was the one who had been making promises to you and offering inducements to you.

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, that officer is still unad---unad---unidentified.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So are you able to explain why it is your Counsel was just an hour ago suggesting to Mr. Chew that he was the one who was stating---stating words to the effect that Shukor and you, Mr. Tan, were ex-colleagues and money transactions are not a big deal.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Lawyer suggest, but all the while this---this---this person is unidentified. I still can’t recall this person.

 |

  
  

23     It would have been inconceivable for Tan to have forgotten that DHI Chew was the Unknown IO, if it was indeed the case, as DHI Chew had given evidence on the 2nd day of the main trial in Tan’s presence _before_ the ancillary hearing and Tan had recalled during his examination-in-chief in the ancillary hearing that he saw DHI Chew at an identity parade (held for a different set of investigations into other offences) conducted on 3 August 2016, the same day that Tan gave Tan’s 1st Statement:[^15]

>   
| 

A

 | 

… IO Lin did brought me to a room to iden---identify Ah Kiat together with him. And we returned back to the room again and continued to give him the statement.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now who was inside the interview room where Ah Kiat was when IO Lin brought you into the interview room?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, I could recall it’s, uh, IO Chew. **IO Chew, earlier the witness.**

 |

  
  

> (Emphasis added.)

24     In contrast, PSI Lin and DHI Chew came across as truthful and candid witnesses who delivered their oral testimonies in clear and detailed fashion without hesitation or embellishment. This was particularly so in the case of PSI Lin who gave a factual blow-by-blow account of how he recorded Tan’s statements. On the other hand, Tan came across as a hesitant witness whose testimony was peppered with pregnant pauses and devoid of details.

25     The evidence of PSI Lin and DHI Chew were internally consistent, even under rigorous cross-examination, and mutually corroborated. Furthermore, they were senior investigation officers who had nothing to gain from colluding to give false testimony in court.

26     Therefore, I preferred the evidence of PSI Lin and DHI Chew over the evidence of Tan on the issue of the Unknown IO.

27     Nevertheless, I also considered Tan’s allegations that the Unknown IO had raised his voice, muttered vulgarities and used words of inducement or promise on him to the following effect:[^16]

> (a)     “Shukor and you are colleagues so money paid between you, no problem?”

> (b)     “Since \[Tan\] and Shukor are friends, money involved does not mean bribe.”

> (c)     “Just tell us more, nothing serious, you will not be charged.”

28     Apart from Tan’s bare assertion that the Unknown IO had given him the impression that he would not be charged, he did not offer any satisfactory account of how this had an impact on the voluntariness of his statement. According to Tan, what crossed his mind was that he could leave after giving the statement:[^17]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

What relevance did these 3 promises or inducements have to you as far as the statement recording on the 3rd of August is concerned?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I think I just give my statement and I can go back.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Well, what impact did these promises and inducement have on you during the recording of your statement on the 3rd of August 2016? Do you want me to repeat my question?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What impact did these 3 promises or inducements have on you during your statement recording on 3rd August 2016?

 |
| 

A

 | 

(pause – 00:00:05) It’s the same thing. After I give my statement, I can go back.

 |

  
  

29     In fact, given that Tan was a former investigation officer, his own experience and knowledge would have dispelled any notion that the Unknown IO could have promised him that he would not be prosecuted.

30     Furthermore, the Unknown IO was purportedly in the interview room for only a brief moment before lunch while the statement was recorded in multiple instalments from 11:40 am to 9:45 pm on 3 August 2016. It was unlikely that any effect from Tan’s brief encounter with the Unknown IO would be sustained for such a long period of time. It was also clear from Tan’s testimony that he continued giving his statement after the Unknown IO left without further ado.[^18]

31     Tan did not raise any meaningful allegations of inducement or promise in relation to Tan’s 2nd Statement. His claim that PSI Lin dissuaded him from making amendments to paragraph 14 of Tan’s 1st Statement lacked details and substance. Furthermore, paragraph 28 of Tan’s 2nd Statement recorded Tan’s request to amend paragraph 6 of Tan’s 1st Statement, which dispelled any inference that PSI Lin had exerted any pressure on Tan to compel him to give Tan’s 2nd Statement against his will.

32     In conclusion, I was satisfied that Tan had given Tan’s 1st Statement and Tan’s 2nd Statement voluntarily. Accordingly, I admitted both statements into evidence.

## The Prosecution’s case

#### Jensen’s Statement

33     Jensen’s Statement provided a factual backdrop to the Prosecution’s case for JC1 and TC1.

34     The material aspects of Jensen’s Statement is reproduced below:

> …

> 7    The recorder asked me if I had offered a sum of money to \[Tan\] to get someone arrested. Yes I did. At that time, \[Tan\] had already left the Police Force. I offered to give \[Tan\] S$4,000 if the person Hoon Tian Jie (“Hoon”) could get arrested by the police because I knew Hoon is involved in illegal activities such as soccer betting and illegal 4D. I got to know Hoon since 2014 because he was working for me in my import and export business overseas. During that time, Hoon was mainly dealing with coordination with overseas supplier on IT and handphone hardwares. Hoon worked for me for about a year and during that period, I got to know that Hoon was also involved in illegal soccer betting and 4D.

> 8    I am sure Hoon was involved in illegal soccer betting and 4D because I have ever betted through him. Sometimes I win and sometimes I lost; but the involved amounts are usually very small. After Hoon stopped working for me, I also continued to place some bets with him. There was one incident sometime last year where I strike the first place 4D and I am supposed to receive a winning of S$25,000 from Hoon; but Hoon delayed on paying my winning and he subsequently became uncontactable. I was angry with Hoon for running away with my winnings and also angry with him for talking bad things about me to my friends and girlfriend. However, it was the running away of S$25,000 which made me angry with Hoon among other reasons. Hoon remain uncontactable till now.

> 9    Sometime in May 2016, I called and arranged to meet up with \[Tan\] at the coffeeshop near my block. During the meet up, we chatted on our personal wellbeing and I also told \[Tan\] about what Hoon had done to me and asked if \[Tan\] can report the matter on my behalf. \[Tan\] told me that he had already resigned from the police force and did not commit to say that he will help me on this matter; but merely commented that he will see what he can do to help me. We did not go into details of this matter in this conversation I had with him. We only got into my details when I met up with him subsequently at Ang Mo Kio.

> 10    Sometime in early July 2016, I called and arranged to meet up with \[Tan\] again and this time at the S11 coffeeshop at Ang Mo Kio central. I arrived first and I ordered my meal. \[Tan\] called me subsequently and told me that he had eaten and he will just wait for me in his car which was parked at the open carpark behind the S11 coffeeshop. I then went to look for \[Tan\] at the carpark and entered his car. While in his car, I provided more details of Hoon to \[Tan\]. I showed \[Tan\] a copy of Hoon’s passport on my handphone and I have an impression that \[Tan\] took a picture of it with his handphone. I got a photo of Hoon’s passport becauase he used to work for me on the import and export jobs. I also provide Hoon’s handphone number to Ah Song.

> 11    While in \[Tan\]’s car, I offered to give S$4,000 to reward \[Tan\] if he can get Hoon arrested for the illegal activities Hoon was involved in. I also told Ah Song that if Hoon was sentenced to an imprisonment term after his arrest, wo hui zhuo ren de (recorder’s note: translated to English to mean “I know what to do”). When I said “wo hui zhuo ren de” to \[Tan\], I mean to say that I can reward him with more money; but this is not directly conversed to \[Tan\]. Although I did not mention exactly how much more I will give \[Tan\] if Hoon got an imprisonment term. I believed that \[Tan\] understand what I say by wo hui zhuo ren de to mean I will reward him more. At this point I would like to state that \[Tan\] did not ask me for any reward and I was the one who initiate to reward him. I did it because I think \[Tan\] would be more enthusiastic in helping me nap Hoon.

> 12    The recorder asked me why I chose to provide the information to \[Tan\] instead of lodging a police report. There are a few reason. Firstly, I feel that the police may not take my complaint seriously and they may just file away it instead of acting on it. Secondly, I am not comfortable in exposing myself as a complainant and I will have to lodge a police report and have my statement taken from me. Thirdly, I feel that \[Tan\] although was no longer a police officer, he should still be aware of the police procedures and also know some police contacts, such as his former colleagues. …

> …

> 14    I would like to state that my intention of rewarding \[Tan\] with S$4,000 to get Hoon arrested for his illegal activities was merely to hope that \[Tan\] would be more enthusiastic in getting Hoon arrested because I was angry with Hoon for running away with my money and badmouthing me in front of my friends. …

#### Tan’s 1st Statement and Tan’s 2nd Statement

35     Tan’s 1st Statement and Tan’s 2nd Statement were consistent with Jensen’s Statement in material aspects, and provided further information on what transpired between Jensen and him in relation to JC1 and TC1, and the steps that Tan took to procure the arrest of Hoon in relation to TC2:

Extracts of Tan’s 1st Statement

 |
| 

13.

 | 

… sometime on the 31 July 2016 which is a Sunday night, I happened to drive past Shukor's house located at Newton Circus vicinity as I just dropped one of my Uber passenger there. I whatsapp Shukor whether he was at home. He replied me that he was at home and then I called him to ask whether he was free to come down to my car and have a chat. He replied me okay and I proceeded to park my car alongside the road just outside his condominium. Shukor subsequently came down to my car and sat at the left front passenger seat. We remained in the car to chat and did not move to anywhere else.

 |
| 

14

 | 

While inside the vehicle with Shukor besides me, I transferred the particulars of one Hoon Tian Jie such as his name; handphone number; passport number; nric number and some offences relating to drugs; bookmaking and illegal 4Ds from my handphone to a piece of paper torn from a scrap paper found in my car. I then passed the piece of paper to Shukor and told him to submit the information about this particular person to our intel branch. I also told Shukor if this guy managed to get arrested by the police, I will be able to get $4,000 from my friend and I will split the money into half to give $2,000 to Shukor. I also told Shukor if this guy managed to get arrested and convicted for imprisonment, I will be able to get more money from my friend. I also told Shukor about what Jansen had mentioned to me and Jansen wanted to seek revenge against the person by submitting the information to the police and get him arrested. Shukor rejected me and told me that how could it be so simple and why I should go believe this friend and it could also have backfired on me. Shukor kept the paper with him and we proceed to chat on to other topics until he went back home. The whole time he was in my car was around 10 to 15minutes. I did not bring up the matter to Shukor again.

 |
| 

15

 | 

I wish to say the friend that I mentioned to Shukor is referring to one Jansen Yee (HP: XXX) whom I knew through my nephew. Jansen is considered a childhood friend of my nephew and I first came to know him sometime in 2005, when he became a guarantor for the vehicle which my nephew was purchasing during that time, while I helped my nephew with the documents for the purchase. After which, I seen Jansen quite a few times during clubbing and we became friends. Sometime in early July 2016, Jansen whatsapp that he was back from overseas and asked me whether I am free to meet up. I was driving Uber during that time and we agreed to meet up at Ang Mo Kio Central carpark. When I arrive at the location, Jansen was already there and he came up sit at the front passenger seat of my car. We did not drive to anywhere else and remained at the same location. While inside the car, Jansen requested me to help him arrest a person called Hoon Tian Jie and in return he will give me $4,000 for a token of appreciation. Jansen had asked for my help because he knew that I still had contacts with the police even though I had already left the force. He had wanted to ask me to use my police contacts to help him get Hoon Tian Jie arrested. Jansen also told me that if Hoon Tian Jie managed to get imprisoned, I will be able to get additional $5,000 on top of the original $4,000. Jansen told me that Hoon Tian Jie is his former business partner and Hoon Tian Jie had badmouthed behind his back, backstabbed him and caused him to break up with his girlfriend. From what Jansen had told me, I can tell he has personal grudges against Hoon Tian Jie and he wanted to find trouble for Hoon Tian Jie. Jansen then refers to a passport image from his handphone and verbally gave me the information and particulars of Hoon Tian Jie, while I recorded them down in my mobile phone. I told Jansen what I can do is to help him submit the information to the police for their follow-up and Jansen agreed. I had agreed to help Jansen because I thought it was quite easy money to get $4,000 just by submitting the information to the police. Furthermore, the information as claimed by Jansen could be true and will assist the police. I actually told Jansen that he can submit the information himself but Jansen told me that he found it troublesome. I wish to say I did not verify the information and I do not know if Hoon Tian Jie had indeed committed those offences as claimed by. Jansen. After the agreement was made, Jansen and I chatted for a while before he came down from my car while I drove away from the carpark.

 |
| 

16

 | 

I wish to say sometime later, Jansen subsequently whataspp one time to ask me about the outcome of the information that he had given to me. I replied to him that it was pending. During that time, I had already referred the information to one IO Rhino Goh from Field Support Squad (FSS) of Investigation Branch of Alpha Division. I called IO Rhino sometime a few days after Jansen approached me and told him I got some information with regards to a subject involving in drug and illegal bookmaking offences. IO Rhino asked me how I have came across this information and I replied IO Rhino that I have gotten the information from a friend and the subject had ran away with my friend's money. IO Rhino agreed to help and he will refer the information to the relevant department. After a few days later, I whataspp the particulars of Hoon Tian Jie to IO Rhino for him to follow up but up till now, IO Rhino has not given me any update yet. I wish to say I did not tell IO Rhino about the agreement between me and Jansen with regards to me getting any money from Jansen if Hoon Tian Jie managed to get arrested or imprisoned. I refer the information to IO Rhino because he was previously my squad mate during my training days and furthermore he was from the FSS which will deal with this kind of information.

 |
| 

17

 | 

I wish to say as I was unable to get a update from IO Rhino and also it happens that I passed by Shukor's house during that day, I decided to make the offer to Shukor to help me to refer the information to the intel branch alpha and to split the money equally, if Hoon Tian Jie managed to get arrested and imprisonment. Another reason I made the offer to Shukor was because I trusted him since I know for many years in the force and he is considered very close to me. However, Shukor rejected my offer during that time. Besides Shukor and IO Rhino, I have not passed this information to any other officer. I wish to add that only Shukor knows about the agreement between me and Jansen.

1 am now shown by the recorder a photocopy of a screenshot from my mobile phone black iPhone 6 with 128GB memory (Recorder's note: Annex TBS-1). I wish to confirm that this is the information and particulars of Hoon Tian Jie which I have gotten from Jansen and which I have recorded down in my handphone under the Notes.

 |
| 

22

 | 

I am now shown by the recorder a photocopy of a screenshot from my mobile phone black iPhone 6 with 128GB memory (Recorder's Note: Annex TBS-2). I wish to confirm that this is the whatsapp correspondence between me and IO Rhino on the 15 July 2016 and I had sent the information and particulars of Hoon Tian Jie to him. On the 1 August 2016 which is a Monday two days ago, I checked with JO Rhino about any news of the info and he replied me that it is still pending.

 |
| 

23

 | 

I am now shown by the recorder a photocopy of paper slip with handwritten words (Recorder's Note: Annex TBS-3). I wish to confirm that this is the paper slip which contains the information and particulars of Hoon Tian Jie that I handwritten in my vehicle and passed it to SSSgt Shukor.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q11

 | 

Why did you make the offer to split the money from Jansen Yee with Shukor and not IO Rhino?

 |
| 

A11

 | 

All Shukor is considered a closer friend and colleague compared to IO Rhino. I worked with Shukor at the UMLS for quite a few years. I have never worked with IO Rhino before even though I knew him since my training days. To me, Rhino is an officer who is very enthusiastic in his police work and I assessed that if I gave him the information, he will most likely work on it. I only made the offer to Shukor because I trusted him more as compared to I0 Rhino and I am less worried that he might reveal the agreement between me and Jansen to other people. Furthermore on the 24 or 25 July 2016 which is a few days before I approached Shukor with the offer, Shukor had asked me for a loan of $2,500 for him to tide over the period. Shukor did not tell me exactly why he needed the money for. I did not agree with his request because I was also quite tied up during that time. On that day when I drove past Shukor's condominium to send a passenger to Gilstead Road, I suddenly remembered about his request for the loan and decided to meet up with him to offer him to share the $4,000 equally, so that I can get $2,000 while he can also earn $2,000 for his loan.

Extract of Tan’s 2nd Statement

 | 

With reference to Para 15 of my previous statement, I am now asked by the recorder to elaborate more about Jansen Yee. I wish to say I do not have any information related to Jansen Yee such as where he stays and what he exactly works as. I only know that he travel overseas frequently and he is doing sales-related business. I did not contact Jansen recently and the last time we spoke is about the referral of information with regards to this Hoon Tian Jie a few weeks ago. Based on Jansen’s linkedin account at http://sg.linkedin.com/in/jensenyee which I managed to search from my own linkedin account, he is a Director of Asia Focus Group and a co-founder of Jenosnow. It appears that his name should be spelt as Jensen instead of Jansen which I had used in the statement. I wish to say that my nephew might also have information about Jansen and he is called Desmond Tan and he can be contacted at \[…\].

#### Evidence of OC Rhino

36     The evidence of OC Rhino was materially consistent with Tan’s 1st Statement.

37     According to OC Rhino, Tan called him twice on 9 July 2016 at 9:37 pm and 10:01 pm and informed him that he had some information to furnish to OC Rhino on a person who was involved in illegal activities, in particular, “illegal betting and loan shark uh, activity type of crime information”.[^19] Tan did not disclose who provided the information to him but told Rhino that the person in question had done something wrong and Tan wanted “the police to arrest him”.[^20] In response, OC Rhino told Tan that these crimes were not within the ambit of FSS’ scope of work and that he would forward the information to the relevant police unit, _ie._ the division intelligence branch (the “**Intel Branch**”).[^21]

38     On 15 July 2016, OC Rhino received the following Whatsapp message from Tan:[^22]

39     OC Rhino testified that the 1st Whatsapp Message was a follow-up to his telephone calls with Tan on 9 July 2016. OC Rhino’s understanding of the 1st Whatsapp Message was as follows:[^23]

40     Aside from the 1st Whatsapp Message, OC Rhino did not receive any other details on Hoon:[^24]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

What evidence Mr. Tan provide you that show that this person was in fact pro-participating illegal activities?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, from the “bookmaking 4D” that line.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Did Mr Tan provide you with any other evidence

 |
| 

A

 | 

That is the, uh, WhatsApp---through the WhatsApp this is the one that he provided me.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Did he provide you anything else?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No.

 |

  
  

41     A few days later, OC Rhino forwarded the information in the 1st Whatsapp Message to the Intel Branch “for them to do their own follow up.”[^25]

42     On the Monday following the 1st Whatsapp Message, Tan sent another message to OC Rhino on Whatsapp asking whether OC Rhino “…hv any news on the info”:[^26]

![]([2020] SGDC 0074_Image/[2020] SGDC 0074_image2.png)

43     OC Rhino replied “Pending” as he had “already sent the info to the respective, uh, Division Intelligence Branch for them to do their own follow up.” There was nothing else that OC Rhino could have done because “… this is out of my job scope already.”[^27]

44     OC Rhino also testified that Tan did not provide any evidence of Hoon’s illegal activities[^28] or offer him any money.[^29]

45     Thereafter, there was no other communication between OC Rhino and Tan regarding Hoon.

#### Evidence of Shukor

46     Shukor’s evidence was also consistent with Tan’s 1st Statement in material aspects. Shukor testified that Tan called him on 31 July 2016 to arrange to meet him for a chat that evening (the “**Meeting**”):[^30]

>   
| 

A

 | 

I can remember on that evening, I was at home with my wife, um, and I receive a call from uh, Tan Bee Song. And uh, he told me that uh, he’s somewhere around the vicini---vicinity of my house and he wanted to meet up for a chat.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And where did you meet up?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, he is just outside my uh, apartment. Along the road.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And when you met him where did you go?

 |
| 

A

 | 

We didn't go anywhere, um, I remembered he---he was asking me uh, “Come down, uh, we can meet up for a chat, then I can smoke”, you know, so I---I---I took my phone and my cigarette, I went downstairs, I looking for him and I saw a car park at the---along the road with the hazard light on, and I approached the car and saw him inside, and uh, he wind down the window and he asked me to get in---inside the car, lah. So, I say okay, and get---I went inside the car.

 |

  
  

47     Shukor testified that he and Tan started the Meeting with casual conversation before Tan moved on to the topic of getting Hoon arrested:[^31]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Now, I want to ask you about the conversation you had with Mr. Tan Bee Song inside the car that day, and I would like you to start from the beginning and to explain in as much detail as you can to His Honour, what happened.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

A

 | 

I cannot remember exactly the words he used, but, initially we were chatting more about uh, things that goes around our life. E---hat he’s doing, uh---uh---uh, about my---about my work, all this kind of stuff, lah, our personal uh, matters, lah.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

A

 | 

…after we talked about uh, things related to our personal matters, uh---uh, Mr. Tan Bee Song told me that someone---someone offered him uh, a sum of $4,000, uh, but then that someone wanted uh, me to---just---that someone wanted uh, another person to be arrested. And uh, he explained further, uh, that this someone has a background related to gambling and uh---uh, yah, that---that’s all I can recall, lah.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Did Mr. Tan Bee Song tell you what this sum of $4,000 was for?

 |
| 

A

 | 

­Uh, it’s a reward for getting someone arrested.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

… We also know that someone had offered Tan Bee Song $4,000?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

I---I want to know who that someone is. Can you put a name to him?

 |
| 

A

 | 

If I can recall correctly, the uh---a name, uh, ‘Jensen’ was mentioned.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And you also mentioned another person, and this other person was supposed to be arrested?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Can you tell the Court who this someone was?

 |
| 

A

 | 

… if I can recall----to my recollection, uh, based on the statement that I gave, a name by---by the name of Hoon, something like that. Hoon.

 |

  
  

48     Subsequently, Tan offered Shukor $2,000 as a reward for Shukor to exercise his powers as an investigation officer to have Hoon arrested “for whatever reason”, and more money if Hoon was eventually sentenced:[^32]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Now, what was the reason that Tan Bee Song was telling you all of this information?

 |
| 

A

 | 

In my opinion, I believe because I am still serving in the force, and uh, as an IO, I'm able to effect an arrest, uh do, uh, any check, uh, in using the system that we have as an IO, lah. That---that’s my---I---my opinion is.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, what did Mr Tan Bee Song want you to do?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, uh, he want me to get this Hoon arrested, and uh, he told me that the 4,000 that was promised by ‘Jensen’, would be split between us.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

When you say “Split”, in what proportions do you mean?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It was not specifically mentioned, but I understand it to be uh, half, 2,000 each.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And you have also said that Tan Bee Song wanted you to get Hoon arrested.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Can you explain what you mean by “Getting Hoon arrested”?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, he told me, ‘Jensen’ uh, asked him to get this Hoon arrested. Uh, doesn’t matter as long---doesn’t matter for whatever reasons, as long as he is arrested. And to---well, I---I can recall, uh, I---I add on that uh, he even mentioned that if this uh, Hoon is um---uh, sentenced, the reward would be more, but not specified, lah.

 |

  
  

49     Shukor told Tan that it was wrong for him (_ie._ Shukor), as a police officer, to accept a reward for doing something and that it “will get us into trouble”.[^33] Furthermore, Shukor could not just arrest anyone without evidence:[^34]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

… You say that you do not have any information that Hoon committed some offence. Could you explain what you mean by this?

 |
| 

A

 | 

By saying that the---Hoon has a background related to drug, book---bookmaking 4D, doesn’t mean that he has committed any offence. That’s what I meant.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And then you go on to say that you cannot just arrest anyone. Can you explain what you mean by this?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, what I meant was that even though I can arrest someone when they committed offence, I cannot just arrest anyone just by uh---uh, upon request. If a person has committed an offence, and um, the information given to us, we have to check before we make the arrest, or if the person committed the offence in our view.

 |

  
  

50     Subsequently, Tan received a call and told Shukor that he had to leave.[^35]

51     Before leaving, Tan wrote the Handwritten Note, as set out below, based on information which he retrieved from his mobile phone and handed it to Shukor:[^36]

![]([2020] SGDC 0074_Image/[2020] SGDC 0074_image3.png)

52     Shukor’s understanding of the Handwritten Note was as follows:[^37]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="41.56%"> <col width="58.44%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Contents of the Note</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Shukor’s Understanding</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">P/P</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">“Uh, ‘P/P’ to our stand---understanding is passport.

53     Shukor’s understanding of the purpose behind Hoon’s arrest was for “Jensen” to get back at Hoon:[^38]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Now, I want to understand from you whether Mr. Tan Bee Soon explained why ‘Jensen’ wanted Hoon to be arrested.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, when Mr. Tan Bee Song told me about the uh, reward offer by ‘Jensen' to get uh, Hoon arrested, um, I think we---we had exchange of, uh---uh, questions. I---I---I told---I---I asked him a few questions. I---I told him why---why he---this ‘Jensen' want this Hoon to be arrested. I even told him that if ‘Jensen' had suspected Hoon to have committed any offence related to all those uh, offences that he has already mentioned, he can always inform the relevant department. So those officers from those---that department can make a check on this Hoon.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Well, Mr. Shukor, I want to know whether Tan Bee Song had explained to you what ‘Jensen's' reasons were for wanting Hoon to be arrested.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh---uh, during the conversation, I can recall um---uh, Tan Bee Song said that this Hoon had---did something uh, to ‘Jensen', uh, something like play him out. So, it's more of like to get back at Hoon.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Could you explain just so we are clear, what “Getting back at Hoon” means?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It's---“Getting back” is more like uh, revenge in my opinion, but I do not know to what extent this Hoon uh, play ‘Jensen' out. Because I don't recall uh, Tan Bee Song explained to me about these things.

 |

  
  

54     Shukor testified that he regarded the offer of a reward for procuring Hoon’s arrest “as a form of bribery” and had told Tan that Jensen “… can always lodge a report or call up the relevant department and give them the information about the offence that this Hoon may have committed.” However, Tan told Shukor that “… ‘Jensen’ doesn’t want to have anything to do with authority.”[^39]

55     Shukor told the court that Tan, as a private citizen, could also have made a police report:[^40]

>   
| 

A

 | 

He may also, if---if he have the information regarding the offence, as uh---because at that point of time, he is not in the force anymore. But, anyone, being a civilian or a public servant, can inform the relevant uh, department if they know of an offence committed by someone, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

#### Evidence of HI Yap

56     HI Yap was in charge of the general management and performance of investigations carried out by investigation officers under her charge.[^41] She recalled that Shukor was an investigation officer with the Unlicensed Moneylending Squad of the Central Division in July 2016 and Tan was an investigation officer with HI Yap in the Unlicensed Moneylending Squad of the Central Division before April 2015.[^42]

57     HI Yap testified that the police would not arrest any person based solely on the filing of a police report as the police would have to be satisfied that the person had committed an arrestable offence before effecting arrest, and that payments were not required for filing a police report:[^43]

>   
| 

A

 | 

Um, when---when a report is made and the information is credible, an arrestable offence has taken place, um, arrestable offence as defined in the Penal Code, uh, the CPC, um, then police would initiate an arrest. That is pertaining to, uh, report lodged. However, uh, at times, uh, under the CPC Section 64, uh, we may also initiate an arrest without warrant. Um, that could be because an arrestable offence has taken place in the police presence and that is before, uh, any, uh, report is being lodged.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay, uh, for---for police to initiate an investigation, usually will need to do certain follow up. Depending on the nature of the case, let’s take for instance, um, if a person were to lodge a report or, uh, hurt that’s related to hurt, um, there must be injuries on the subject to confirm that, at least, you know, there is, uh, some evidence, uh, before police initiate, uh, an arrest. So it depends on the nature of, uh, the offence, uh, that is and also the information, uh, that is provided by the Complainant.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

A

 | 

I think for police officer, what we are concern is, is always wrongful arrest. Um, in the course of our work, uh, at times, um, people lodge report, um, not because, uh, a real offence has taken place, but, uh, some time there were a certain kind of misunderstanding or an axe to grind. Um, so we have---as police officer who are vested with police powers to arrest, uh, we have to be very sure before, uh, we initiate, uh, such arrest. Um, I think in the context, this is what we called fairness, not only to the Complainant, uh, but to all the rest of the people, uh, or in fact the ones that, uh, are targeted (_sic_).

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You have also made reference to Section 64 CPC. Is that a section that police officers and investigation officers would be aware of?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

If there is no evidence to show that someone has committed an offence, would it be correct for the police to arrest them?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And would it be correct for the police to arrest someone because a Complainant has, as you say, an axe to grind with him?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, it’s not correct.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Would a member of the public have to make payments to the police in order to have the police investigate a case?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Would a member of the public have to make payments to a police officer in order for the police to investigate a case?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How about changing the focus of investigations to arrest? Would a member of the public have to make any payments to the police to have someone else arrested?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How about to a police officer, in order to have someone else arrested?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Would either of these things be allowed?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Are IOs allowed to receive money from---

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

members of---

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, uh, police officers are not allowed to receive money in the course of their work or to initiate any work.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, you have just said the police officers are not---are not allowed to receive money in their course of their work. Is this something that is communicated to police officers generally?

 |
| 

A

 | 

There is an established stand, uh, in the Singapore Police Force against corruption. Um, and this stand is inculcated in our officers since our training days, um, as well as in our yearly online test. Um, and this test cover topics such as the conduct, um, and recognition, um, of rejecting bribes. So, I would say that not only---in fact, not only police officer, a general member of the public would know that, uh, public servants are not allowed to receive money or gratifications or any favours, um, in the course of their work.

 |

  
  

## End of the Prosecution’s case

58     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, neither Jensen nor Tan sought to make submissions that there was no case to answer.

59     I considered the evidence of the Prosecution and found that there was evidence, not inherently incredible, that satisfied each and every element of the respective charges against Jensen and Tan. Accordingly, I called on Jensen and Tan to enter their respective defences.

60     Both Jensen and Tan elected to give evidence from the witness box on oath or affirmation.

## Jensen’s defence

61     Jensen testified that Hoon was involved in criminal activities, in particular, drug abuse and illegal soccer bookmaking. Hoon used to work for Jensen but Jensen eventually fired him due to his poor work performance and because Jensen was angry that he took drugs. However, Jensen continued to place soccer bets with Hoon. On one occasion, Jensen won $25,000 from the illegal soccer bets that he placed with Hoon. However, Hoon did not pay him the winnings and went missing.[^44]

62     Jensen also found out that Hoon had spread malicious rumours about him that led to him breaking up with his girlfriend:[^45]

>   
| 

A

 | 

He---he---he basically, took it, uh---uh, grudge against me and continued to spread, uh, negative things, rumours, um, for 2---2 years until 201---2016.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, Basically causing me and my, uh, long-time girlfriend to break up.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

A

 | 

Saying I was a trustwor---a---a---untrustworthy person, um, negative things like, um, uh, this guy cannot be worked with, uh, or this kind of, uh, saying, uh, I’m with, uh other girls this kid of related rumours.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So did that cause you to end your relationship with your long-time girlfriend?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, yes, Sir.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And when did this happen?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, basically in 2016

 |

  
  

63     As Jensen was concerned that Hoon was committing crimes, Jensen decided to seek Tan’s help to report Hoon to the police:[^46]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Why you so concern that he’s committing crime? If you he’s not working for you for about 2 years, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Why you so concerned that’s he committing crime?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, okay, basically, I have to say something is, of course I don’t like this guy, lah. You know I---this a very, uh, honest truth that I don’t like this guy, um, that’s why I decided to, uh, report this guy to the authorities.

 |

  
  

64     Jensen explained that he had approached Tan even though Tan had left the police force because Tan should know police procedures very well: “ I mean, the report on---on this guy will be much (speaking in a different language) means ‘Will be more’---”.[^47]

65     Jensen testified that he did not file a police report himself because he was unfamiliar with the procedure:[^48]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

I’m asking you the question. Why did you not make your police report to yourself? Tell the Court.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay, because, uh, Sir, I been away for this past 5 or 6 years, so in regards to these police procedures or actually making police report or I don’t even know if the police will actually follow up on this kind of, uh, information, um, that’s why I didn’t really make a---go to a police station and make a police report, because I’m quite unsure of the police procedure---I mean, what they would do, so I thought that Mr. Tan which is, um, my long-time family friend, I decided to seek advice from him and actually ask him to---I mean, I will provide the information on---on this guy and tell him to investigate on this matter.

 |

  
  

66     Consequently, Jensen arranged to meet Tan in May 2016 (the “**1**st**Meeting**”), during which Jensen told Tan about Hoon and asked Tan for advice. Tan told Jensen, “If I help you, I will only submit this information to the relevant authorities to make sure that his report is being reported.”[^49]

67     Jensen testified that, at that point in time, he just wanted to submit information to the relevant authorities for them to “do a check on this Hoon Tian Jie if he’s committing offence then if he’s not then---I mean we can’t do anything.” Jensen denied any intention to procure the wrongful arrest of Hoon.[^50]

68     After 2 months elapsed with no follow-up, Jensen arranged for another meeting with Tan in July 2016 (the “**2**nd**Meeting**”).[^51] During the 2nd Meeting, Jensen asked Tan to help him submit the information on Hoon to the police. This time round, Tan replied that “he will think on what kind of solution he can help \[Jensen\] on this.”[^52] Jensen then offered to pay Tan a sum of $4,000 to Tan to file the police report.[^53]

69     Jensen denied any corrupt intent when he offered to pay Tan the sum of $4,000. He rationalised it as “part of the errands that \[Tan’s\] running for \[Jensen\]” and he felt sorry for Tan:[^54]

>   
| 

A

 | 

It doesn’t came---uh, it’s not a calculated amount. I mean, I---I didn’t really---I didn’t really think, uh, of the amount. It’s because at that point of time, uh, Mr. Tan, he is just out of the police force and I can say I---in a way, I feel sorry for him. I---I pity him on his current situation. Then I just say, uh, “You just take---uh, you just take, it’s okay.”

 |

  
  

70     As part of Jensen’s case, Jensen’s defence counsel adduced Jensen’s statement recorded under section 23 of the CPC on 12 June 2017 at 9:20 am which stated the following bullet points:[^55]

> ·    Tan Bee Song not a police officer.

> ·    Hoon Tian Jie was not arrested at all.

> ·    Hoon Tian Jie was seen consuming drugs.

> ·    Therefore it’s not correct to say that Hoon Tian Jie was “wrongfully arrested”.

71     Jensen explained the statement as follows:[^56]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So can you explain to the Court why you responded in this way?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, because---because I don’t---I don’t think there’s a charge at all at the---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Why do you say that?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Because inducement to wrongfully arrest, so, uh, like I said in the statement, uh, Tan Bee Song is not police officer then Hoon Tian Jie is not arrested at all, but, uh, Hoon Tian Jie was seen consuming drugs by our common friends.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

A

 | 

So that’s why I say is not corru---it’s not correct to say Hoon Tian Jie was wrongfully arrest, because there was no arrest being done and, uh---uh, and how you define wrongfully arrest because he was really committing crime, but nobody till now, nobody really go and clarify if that is the case.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How do you know whether---do you really know whether Mr. Hoon was ever arrested?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I---I’m not sure, I don’t know.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay, so I---I---I---I don’t want to put words in your mouth because I want it to be your evidence, when you say it is not correct to say Hoon Tian Jie is wrongfully arrested, what do you mean? What did you mean when you made this statement?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, because, uh, at the point of time he was not arrested, so by right, I---I think based on my knowledge on this wrongfully arrest he should be arrested then, uh, there’s like, uh, wrongfully arrest him lah, there’s at least action being done lah, so but, uh, right, at the point of time a---as to my knowledge in 2016 I---I don’t think there is this action being done that’s why I say this thing.

## Tan’s defence

72     Tan confirmed that he met with Jensen on 2 occasions at the 1st Meeting and the 2nd Meeting, and shed more light on what transpired at the meetings:

>   
| 

The 1st Meeting [^57]

 |
| 

A

 | 

In May 2016, could recall that ‘Jensen’ had call me up for lunch. We met up at coffee shop near his, uh, house at MRT---at Sembawang. While meeting up, during the conversations, during our discussion and chit-chatting, ‘Jensen’ did bring up this---his problem to me, telling me that this person, Hoon Tian Jie, was s---was so called bad-mouthing him and create---create things behind his back, and during---during---during the meet-up, during this meet-up, it was, uh, quite a very short conversation about this Hoon Tian Jie, and ‘Jensen’ tol---ask me whether, can I help him to submit this information on behalf for him. I will say, “Yes.” But during the point of time ‘Jensen’ does not have the detail of Hoon Tian Jie.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, what was the conclusion in the meeting of May 2016, pertaining to Hoon Tian Jie?

 |
| 

A

 | 

And---this conversation wa---was short, and after that I think we did not conclude on whether to submit this in---information or not. Thereafter, then ‘Jensen’ say that a few days later, he might, he will leave to China again. So, that was the meet-up during May.

 |
| 

The 2nd Meeting[^58]

 |
| 

A

 | 

In July 2016, I could recall that sometime in the evening, ‘Jensen’ called me again and ask me, um, where am I, and I could recall that I was at Bedok area and ‘Jensen’ say that whether want to meet out for meal. Then I told ‘Jensen’ that I have eaten, then ‘Jensen’ say, “Come, come over.” I ask ‘Jensen’ where is he, he say he’s at, “Ang Mo Kio Central.” So, I drove my car to Ang Mo Kio Central car park. When I reached the car park, I ring ‘Jensen’ again, and ‘Jensen’ walked over to my car and sat inside the car.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And what did you speak while he’s at the car?

 |
| 

A

 | 

We speak. When inside the car, ‘Jensen’ told me that again, about this issue of Hoon Tian Jie. This time he told me that he got the passport of Hoon Tian Jie and---and he want me to submit information on behalf of him. ‘Jensen’ also told me that, “Well, this Hoon Tian Jie is involved in drugs, and illegal bookmaking.” I also could roughly recall that ‘Jensen’ had told me something about he run away some money, some money, yup. So, when ‘Jensen’ look at his phone of the, uh, so call this a screenshot from his phone of this Hoon Tian Jie. I then, uh, copying down, transfer, look at the phone then I type it down into my iPhone 6.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

A

 | 

I confirm that, um, the name, the passport number, and the NRIC, it was from ‘Jensen’, I copy from ‘Jensen’, uh, phone, the screenshot, and as for the handphone numbers, ‘Jensen’ write it to me then I---I type it down, and as for the offence committed, ‘Jensen’ did told me that this guy was involved in drugs, Erimin 5, Ice, bookmaking and 4D. So, as for the, um, resign from regular SAF 2013. It was ‘Jensen’ told me.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Did you clarify with ‘Jensen’ pertaining to his statement, pertaining to Hoon Tian Jie has run away with ‘Jensen’s’ money?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I did not. That was, um, very short, short conversation.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

After this information was handed over to you, what happened?

 |
| 

A

 | 

What I could recall that ‘Jensen’ did say that, “Well, um, I will g---I will---I will---I will give you 4,000, I will give 4,000. Then I smiled at him, and, uh, ‘Jensen’ also further state that “wo hui zuo ren de”, uh, which means, for my interpretation is---which means, uh, he will know what to do.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What was your understanding when he says that “wo hui zuo ren de”?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I mean, maybe he might pay me more, or maybe when---when times---times come he will p---he will pass me this money.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, was it a condition that Hoon Tian Jie must be arrested before you receive $4,000?

 |
| 

A

 | 

There’s no condition on this, and I did also told ‘Jensen’ that what I could do is only submit information on behalf of him, and there’s no guarantee of arrest, and there’s no guarantee of convicted.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Was there any commitment, or any requirement that Hoon Tian Jie must be jail?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

73     Few days after the 2nd Meeting, Tan called OC Rhino and provided him with the information that Hoon was involved in “illegal bookmaking and 4D collection”. OC Rhino had asked Tan why he had such information, to which Tan replied “this person have---had so called run away my friend money.” OC Rhino then asked Tan to send him the information _via_ Whatsapp, which Tan did (_ie._ the 1st Whatsapp Message).[^59]

74     Tan explained that even though Jensen only mentioned that Hoon was involved in bookmaking and drug offences, he had also stated “loan” because he had mistakenly thought that Hoon was involved in unlicensed moneylending activities because Jensen told him “something like person had run away the money”.[^60]

75     Subsequently, when Tan thought that OC Rhino was not going to submit Hoon’s information to the relevant police unit, Tan reached out to Shukor and offered him $4,000 to do the same:[^61]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Now, could you inform the Court sometime in July 2016, what happened, what transpired between you as you go.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Before I met Shukor, I did message, uh, ‘Rhino’ about any outcome or update of the, uh, information which I submitted to him, and ‘Rhino’ did reply to me “Pending”. So, for my impression, I was thinking that ‘Rhino’ might had just brush me off or might not have submitted this information, and sometime in late---late July, while I was driving a passenger---drop off a passenger near---near Newton Area, I just could---correction, I---I---I just could recall that, few days back Shukor did call me up and wanted me to loan him some money. So, duli---during that Sunday night, as I was to---there’s no passe---not---not much passenger to drive around. So, when I---I alight my passenger at this Gilstead Road which is in Newton Area, I could recall Shukor---Shukor, um, asking me for this favour. As such, I decided to call Shukor up, and ask Shukor, “Brother, are you free or not? Want to have a chit-chat?” Shu---Shukor agree and, uh, I drove to Shukor apartment and I park my car outside his condominium, and a while later Shukor came down and he was smoking and a while later, he came to my car and we have a chit-chat. We was talking ab---we were chit-chatting to one another about, how is his life in the police force, how am I driving as a Grab driver. During this conversation inside the car, I also tell Shukor about this piece of information. I told Shukor that, “Yes bro, I got this piece of information of so called my friend. Say that is, this per---this person Hoon Tian Jie is involved in some crimes. Can you help me to submit this information?” I also told Shukor about the reason why so called ‘Jensen’ wanted to submit this information. I told Shukor that if s---this---this---this Hoon Tian Jie was his ex-staff, and he had been committing so called these drugs offences and bookmaking, and Shukor asked me back, “Why then your friend wanted to report again this person?” I then told Shukor that, “Well, sometimes when you good friends, they wouldn’t harm one another when some---sometimes when---when friends turn into enemy, well, you will tend to report against him.” And Shukor told me that, “Well, this thing can't work.” He rejected me. So, I told him that, “Well, if I got this money, I can ch---‘Jensen’ will promise me to---to pass me this $4,000 when information submitted well, I can loan you a sum that---that---that---that amount of money which you want.”

 |

  
  

76     Tan explained that he had offered money to Shukor but not OC Rhino because Shukor had previously asked him for a loan:[^62]

>   
| 

A

 | 

As for why I did not mention any money to ‘Rhino’ was because I just merely want to submit information through ‘Rhino’ to submit to the---to the relevant intelligent (_sic_) branch and why did I mention about money to Shukor was because Shukor really approach me before this information was received uh, 2---2 weeks before he---did came to ask me for a sum of 2,500 that’s why I approach Shukor in term of asking him to submit this information and also I can help him with his loan, it’s not---it’s not to split the money with Shukor with the earning.

 |

  
  

77     Even though Shukor had rejected Tan’s offer, Tan wrote down Hoon’s particulars and alleged illegal activities on a piece of paper (_ie._ the Handwritten Note) and handed it to Shukor before leaving.[^63]

## Assessment of the evidence

#### The Prosecution’s case

78     Tan’s 1st Statement, Tan’s 2nd Statement and Jensen’s Statement were the bedrock of the Prosecution’s case. Recorded on different occasions by different investigation officers,[^64] they came together like complementary pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and presented a complete picture of the nefarious plot between Jensen and Tan for the wrongful arrest of Hoon.

79     Jensen’s Statement and Tan’s 1st Statement were mutually consistent in many material aspects, for example:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.72%"> <col width="50.28%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Jensen’s Statement</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Tan’s 1</b> <sup>st</sup> <b>Statement</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 Sometime in early July 2016, I called and arranged to meet up with [Tan] again and this time at the S11 coffeeshop at Ang Mo Kio central. … While in his car, I provided more details of Hoon to [Tan].

Although I did not mention exactly how much more I will give [Tan] if Hoon got an imprisonment term. I believed that [Tan] understand what I say by wo hui zhuo ren de to mean I will reward him more.

80     The Prosecution’s case against Tan was buttressed by the evidence of OC Rhino and Shukor that materially corroborated Tan’s 1st Statement where Tan had stated that:

> (a)     he had approached OC Rhino and provided OC Rhino with Hoon’s information (_ie._ the 1st Whatsapp Message) so that OC Rhino could help him forward the information to the relevant police unit; and

> (b)     he had subsequently approached Shukor, provided Shukor with Hoon’s information (_ie._ the Handwritten Note) and offered to split Jensen’s offer of $4,000 with him if he arrested Hoon.

81     In contrast to the Prosecution’s case, I found that the respective defences put up by Jensen and Tan were shadowy and lacked depth and substance.

#### Jensen’s defence

82     Jensen’s attempts to deflect the Prosecution’s case, in particular, his explanations of his statement (_ie._ Jensen’s Statement), came across as contrived and, at times, disingenuous.

83     Jensen had stated in clear and simple terms in his statement (_ie._ Jensen’s Statement) that he wanted to report Hoon because he was angry with Hoon for not paying his winnings of $25,000:

> 9    Sometime in May 2016, I called and arranged to meet up with Ah Song at the coffeeshop near my block. **During the meet up, we chatted on our personal wellbeing and I also told Ah Song about what Hoon had done to me and asked if Ah Song can report the matter on my behalf.** …

84     Tan also echoed in Tan’s 1st Statement that Jensen sounded like he had a grudge against Hoon and wanted to find trouble for him:

>   
| 

15

 | 

… Jansen told me that Hoon Tian Jie is his former business partner and Hoon Tian Jie had badmouthed behind his back, backstabbed him and caused him to break up with his girlfriend. From what Jansen had told me, I can tell he has personal grudges against Hoon Tian Jie and he wanted to find trouble for Hoon Tian Jie. …

 |

  
  

85     During the trial, Jensen tried to play down his resentment against Hoon by denying that “it doesn’t really as---really to so serious until I want to seek revenge and, uh, personal grudges, this kind of thing” even though he conceded that he was “a bit pissed and angry” with Hoon.[^65]

86     However, there was overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

87     First, even though Jensen knew that the police would not have taken him seriously if he had filed a police report against Hoon without any evidence:[^66]

>   
| 

A

 | 

**… I don’t want to go a neighbourhood police station. Because I don’t have concrete evidence of, ah, Ah Hoon, uh, illegal activities. Okay. Uh, because I think that, me by going to a police station and saying, this guy is consuming drugs without, uh, concrete evidence on, um, of these offences. I think that police station or the police won’t be able to take me seriously…**

 |

  
  

> he nonetheless turned to Tan’s police contacts to have Hoon arrested:[^67]

> 12    … I feel that \[Tan\] although was no longer a police officer, he should still be aware of the police procedures and also know some police contacts, such as his former colleagues. …

88     This was mirrored in Tan’s 1st Statement:

>   
| 

15

 | 

… While inside the car, Jansen requested me to help him arrest a person called Hoon Tian Jie and in return he will give me $4,000 for a token of appreciation. … **He had wanted to ask me to use my police contacts to help him get Hoon Tian Jie arrested**. Jansen also told me that if Hoon Tian Jie managed to get imprisoned, I will be able to get additional $5,000 on top of the original $4,000. …

(Emphasis added.)

 |

  
  

89     Second, Jensen’s desire to get Hoon into trouble was also evident from his offer of more money to Tan if Hoon was “sentenced to an imprisonment term after his arrest”.[^68]

90     Jensen’s Statement that was peppered with reiterations of his desire to have Hoon arrested also squarely contradicted his assertion that he only wanted Hoon to be reported to the police. His attempt at explaining paragraph 7 of his statement, where he stated that he offered $4,000 to Tan for Hoon to be arrested, was circuitous and _non sequitur_:[^69]

>   
| 

A

 | 

Yes, Sir. But because, the recorder asked me. The exact question, if I offer sum of money to get someone arrested. At that point of time, I’m very sure that Hoon Tian Jie is involved in---in illegal activities. That’s why I said that, yes, because I’m quite sure he’s involved with activities. It’s actually is like the misunderstanding of English language because, uh, when I’m talking to this recorder, I also got use Chinese as well. So why I said I did? Because I’m very sure that Hoon Tian Jie is involved in illegal activities, that’s why I said, “Yes, I did.”

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. But you know the difference between giving information the police and asking someone to get somebody arrested. You know it’s got 2 different meanings, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It was until I was arrested for this offence, then I realised, uh, I---I’m---I’m in---I’m in---uh, I was---I was charged for this to get someone arrested. Because as I have mentioned in the state---uh, as I have mentioned in the, uh, just now, uh, Mr. Tan, repeatedly told me, uh, each of the meetings s---s---saying that if Hoon Tian Jie is not doing any illegal activities, we cannot get him to be arrested. And this is---is like I and Mr. Tan is like common sense to us. Know, how---how can we get somebody arrested without---if he’s not committing any offence?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. So I’m going to ask you again. At the time when you asked Mr. Tan Bee Song to help you, what was your intention?

 |
| 

A

 | 

To submit information to relevant authorities, that’s all. Because, uh, I would like to expand on this part. It---it---it doesn’t really make sense to basically get somebody arrested if he didn’t do any illegal thing. And even arrested, I think he will be immediately let go. So there is basically no---no---uh, it’s like, uh, it doesn’t makes sense for me to actually asking Mr. Tan to immediately arrest Hoon if he’s not doing any illegal activities.

 |

  
  

91     I did not accept Jensen’s assertion that Tan had already agreed to help him before he offered the sum of $4,000 at the 2nd Meeting as Tan had merely said that he “will see what he can do”, which was ambivalent and non-committal. It was only after Jensen made the offer of $4,000 that Tan appeared to have warmed up:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

After this information was handed over to you, what happened?

 |
| 

A

 | 

What I could recall that ‘Jensen’ did say that, “Well, um, I will g---I will---I will---I will give you 4,000, I will give you 4,000. Then I smiled at him, and, uh, ‘Jensen’ also further state that “wo hui zuo ren de”, uh, which means, for my interpretation is---which means, uh, he will know what to do.

 |

  
  

92     This was consistent with Jensen’s statement where he said that he had offered $4,000 to Tan so that he would be more enthusiastic in getting Hoon arrested:

> (a)    “… I was the one who initiate to reward him. I did it because I think \[Tan\] will be more enthusiastic in helping me nap (_sic_) Hoon”.[^70]

> (b)    “… my intention of rewarding \[Tan\] with S$4,000 … was merely to hope that \[Tan\] would be more enthusiastic in getting Hoon arrested…”[^71]

93     Therefore, when stripped of rhetoric, the essence of Jensen’s defence was nothing more than bare denials and assertions that flew in the face of the overwhelming evidence of the Prosecution which was corroborated by the evidence of Tan.

#### Tan’s defence

94     Tan’s defence was primarily a barrage of bare denials. Notwithstanding Tan’s 1st Statement, which was corroborated by OC Rhino and Shukor, Tan maintained his defence that he had agreed to accept $4,000 from Jensen only for the purpose of submitting Hoon’s information to the police. However, this assertion went against the grain of the evidence.

95     First, if the offer of $4,000 was for Tan to file a police report and nothing more, he could have fulfilled his end of the bargain and earned the money by simply filing a police report at a police station or on the police website.

96     Second, even if Tan had intended to furnish Hoon’s information to the police through his contacts in the police, his task was complete when OC Rhino informed him that the matter was already pending. However, Tan took the further step of approaching Shukor which strongly suggested that his intention was more than just report Hoon to the police. On the contrary, the evidence disclosed that Tan wanted Shukor to have Hoon arrested.

97     During examination-in-chief, Tan was given the opportunity to explain many parts of Tan’s 1st Statement that were adverse to his case, but his responses were self-serving and lacked cogency:

> (a)     Paragraph 14 of Tan’s 1st Statement, where Tan told Shukor that he would split the $4,000 with him:

>> 14.    … I then passed the piece of paper to Shukor and told him to submit the information about this particular person to our intel branch. I also told Shukor if this guy managed to get arrested by the police, I will be able to get $4,000 from my friend and I will split the money into half to give $2,000 to Shukor. … I also told Shukor about what Jansen had mentioned to me and Jansen wanted to seek revenge against the person by submitting the information to the police and get him arrested. …

> Tan’s explanation in court:[^72]

>   
| 

A

 | 

What I meant was to ask Shukor to submit the information and at the same time I could have the sufficient money and to loan it to him and also there’s paragraph 14 the last 2 sentence ‘Jensen’ wanted to seek revenge against the person---seek revenge is not the word I used of---when I spoke to the IO. What I told the IO was ‘Jensen’ was not in a good term with this Hoon Tian Jie.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

The complete sentence by submitting the information to police and get him arrested. Clarify? Did you say get him arrested?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, I did not mention that.

 |

  
  

> (b)     Paragraph 15 of Tan’s 1st Statement, where Tan said that Jensen would pay him $4,000 if he got Hoon arrested:

>> 15.    … While inside the car, Jansen requested me to help him arrest a person called Hoon Tian Jie and in return he will give me $4,000 for a token of appreciation. Jansen had asked for my help because he knew that I still had contacts with the police even though I had already left the force. **He had wanted to ask me to use my police contacts to help him get Hoon Tian Jie arrested.** …

> Tan’s explanation in court:[^73]

>   
| 

A

 | 

Somewhere in paragraph 15 sentence 10 “While inside the car ‘Jensen’ request me to help him arrest a person called Hoon Tian Jie and he will give me 4,000 for a token for appreciation.”

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

A

 | 

What I could say that I told the IO that ‘Jensen’ wanted me to submit a information and it’s true enough that ‘Jensen’ will give me this $4,000 for---for---for token.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But is it conditional that you submit the information then you get $4,000?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, it’s conditional.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Any other comments in the same paragraph is a big chunk---

 |
| 

A

 | 

The whole paragraphs---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

please read carefully.

 |
| 

A

 | 

keep saying that “get Hoon Tian Jie arrested”, “get Hoon Tian Jie arrested”, I don’t think, uh, I did use this word “get Hoon Tian Jie arrested”, what I told the officer the IO was to submit the information.

 |

  
  

> (c)     Paragraph 17 of Tan’s 1st Statement, where Tan again said that he would split the $4,000 with Shukor:

> 17.    I wish to say as I was unable to get a update from IO Rhino and also it happens that I passed by Shukor's house during that day, I decided to make the offer to Shukor to help me to refer the information to the intel branch alpha and to split the money equally, if Hoon Tian Jie managed to get arrested and imprisonment. Another reason I made the offer to Shukor was because I trusted him since I know for many years in the force and he is considered very close to me. However, Shukor rejected my offer during that time. Besides Shukor and IO Rhino, I have not passed this information to any other officer. I wish to add that only Shukor knows about the agreement between me and Jansen.

> Tan’s explanation in court:[^74]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Read quickly, please clarify to split the money equally.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, inside the vehicle, inside my car, I strongly can recall that what I meant about the money was---when Shukor help me to submit this information when I got money from ‘Jensen’ then I loan him the sum of 2,500 it’s not mainly split into half or what.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

More importantly following that sentence is the next half of the sentence if Hoon Tian Jie manage to get arrested and imprisonment, clarify?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, I admit that I did told Shukor about this, uh, if Hoon Tian Jie manage to get arrested and imprisonment what I meant was that the---the information was supposed to be true and Hoon Tian Jie will get be arrested and imprisonment.

 |

  
  

> (d)     Answer 10 to question 10 in Tan’s 1st Statement, where Tan stated that there was a possibility that the information provided was false as Jensen appeared to have personal grudges against Hoon:

>   
| 

Q10

 | 

Is there a possibility that the information given by Jansen is false and is used to frame Hoon Tian Jie for any offence?

 |
| 

A10

 | 

I am not sure but there is a possibility as Jansen appears to have personal grudges against Hoon. From what Jansen had told me, my personal assessment is that this guy might have committed some offences related to drugs, illegal bookmaking etc. However, I do not know if what Jansen told me is the truth and I was unable to verify it.

Thi---in this question (clears throat)---this answer is from my point of view ah---of course I’m not sure that there is a possibility that ‘Jensen’ appear to have personal grudges against Hoon from what ‘Jensen’ have told me my personal \[inaudible\] is---guy might have committed some offences, however, I do not know if ‘Jensen’ told me is true as I was unable to verify.

Q11

 | 

Why did you make the offer to split the money from Jansen Yee with Shukor and not IO Rhino?

 |
| 

A11

 | 

All Shukor is considered a closer friend and colleague compared to IO Rhino. I worked with Shukor at the UMLS for quite a few years. I have never worked with IO Rhino before even though I knew him since my training days. To me, Rhino is an officer who is very enthusiastic in his police work and I assessed that if I gave him the information, he will most likely work on it. I only made the offer to Shukor because I trusted him more as compared to I0 Rhino and I am less worried that he might reveal the agreement between me and Jansen to other people.

 |

  
  

> Tan’s explanation in court:

| 

A

 | 

As for why I did not mention any money to ‘Rhino’ was because I just merely want to submit information through ‘Rhino’ to submit to the---to the relevant intelligent branch and why did I mention about money to Shukor was because Shukor really approach me before this information was received uh, 2---2 weeks before he---did came to ask me for a sum of 2,500 that’s why I approach Shukor in term of asking him to submit this information and also I can help him with his loan, it’s not---it’s not to split the money with Shukor with the earning.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Could you clarify what you mean in the last sentence, “so that I can get $2,000 while he can earn $2,000 for his loan”.

 |
| 

A

 | 

This is what I meant earlier that where I got extra money get it from ‘Jensen’ well I can loan him this amount of money and I would like to further tell the Court then when I call Shukor, um, I met up Shukor my intention was not to bribe him at all, my intention was to help a friend a colleague, a---a, ex-colleague and until the day I was being arrested by CPIB when this---this allegas---this allegation was brought up by CPIB, I only ne---educate me that telling me that your status and Shukor’s status is now different, he’s a police officer and you’re a member of the public from there I---I admitted, yes, due---due to the---the status of one another, yes I did might have commit some offences, but to the Court I can tell Your Honour that I have no intention to bribe Shukor at all.

98     As for Tan’s evidence that he offered money to Shukor because Shukor had previously asked him for a loan, which was not disputed by Shukor, this had no bearing on the fact that, when Tan offered $2,000 to Shukor on 31 July 2016, there was no reference to the loan and no solicitation by Shukor. Furthermore, according to Shukor, he eventually managed to obtain a bank loan and did not require the loan from Tan:[^75]

But he told me that he doesn’t have that amount, so I say “It’s okay, fine. Never mind.” Subsequently I got approval from another bank to loan me, yah.

#### Courts’ findings

99     At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that:

> (a)     Jensen had offered a sum of $4,000 to Tan and Tan had agreed to receive a sum of $4,000;

> (b)     Tan had offered a sum of $2,000 (_ie._ half of the $4,000 that Jensen offered Tan) to Shukor;

> (c)     Jensen’s offer to Tan was an inducement for Tan to procure the wrongful arrest of Hoon;

> (d)     Tan had agreed to accept Jensen’s offer as an inducement to procure the wrongful arrest of Hoon; and

> (e)     Tan’s offer to Shukor was a reward for Shukor, a police officer and an agent of the police force, to wrongfully arrest Hoon.

100    Having established the purpose behind the corrupt transactions, _ie._ the wrongful arrest of Hoon, the next consideration was whether the purpose was objectively corrupt. In this respect, the test is succinctly set out in _Chan Wing Seng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 721</span> at \[20\]:

> 20    Whether a transaction has a corrupt element is an objective inquiry that is essentially based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. … The contravention of some rules or laws can also assist the court in deciding whether the intended transaction is corrupt according to the objective criteria. This is done by looking at the purpose behind the rules or laws. For example, if they are specifically designed to prevent bribery, then breaking them will invariably lead to the finding of a corrupt element.

101    The laws pertaining to the arrest of a person are found in, amongst other legislations, the CPC and the Police Force Act (Cap 235, Rev Ed 2006). Based on the evidence of HI Yap, there were rigorous police procedures to be complied with for the arrest of a person. In particular, the police would have to be satisfied that the person had committed an arrestable offence. HI Yap also told the court that payment was not necessary for making a police report.

102    Jensen and Tan were aware of the need for the police to have evidence of an arrestable offence before an arrest could be made. Jensen and Tan were also candid in conceding that they had no evidence of Hoon’s purported illegal activities. Jensen went so far as to admit that the police would not have taken him seriously if he had filed a police report against Hoon on such basis.

103    Consequently, I was satisfied that the respective intentions of Jensen and Tan to leverage on Tan’s police contacts to arrest Hoon, without any evidence of Hoon’s purported illegal activities, by circumventing proper police procedures were objectively corrupt.

104    I also found that Jensen had the requisite corrupt knowledge when he offered $4,000 to tap on Tan’s police contacts instead of filing a police report himself as he knew that the police would not have taken him seriously since he did not have any evidence of Hoon’s illegal activities.

105    Similarly, Tan was a former police officer and investigation officer who knew that a person could be arrested only if there was evidence that the person had committed a crime:[^76]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Now, I want to talk about arresting somebody. In order to arrest someone, there has to be some evidence that that person committed a crime, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, I agree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And \[the HI\] when she was giving evidence, referred to this as a prima facie case. You agree with that?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, I agree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

… Police officers do not go and effect an arrest just because a complainant has a grudge against that individual, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, I agree, Your Honour.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Well, the police might expend resources following up on the complaint but that’s because there is a reasonable basis to conclude an offence had taken place, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And it’s not because, you know, just because the complainant is unhappy or has a grudge that they go and investigate, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

If the offence were to be established well, police will able to nab the person.

 |

  
  

106    Tan was also aware that a police officer was not allowed to receive money from the public in relation to their work as that would amount to a bribe:[^77]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Well, in your time as a police officer, you were aware that police officer are not allowed to receive money from the public in relation to their work, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I agree, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And that would really amount to a bribe, wouldn’t it?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I agree, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

107    Therefore, Tan’s admission that Jensen had not provided him with any evidence of Hoon’s purported illegal activities, Tan’s persistence in getting Hoon wrongfully arrested by offering a sum of $2,000 to Shukor, even after OC Rhino had informed Tan that the matter was already pending, pointed sharply to Tan’s corrupt knowledge.

108    Tan’s guilty knowledge was further reinforced by his admission that he was selective in making the offer of $2,000 to Shukor and not OC Rhino as he was worried that OC Rhino would expose the corruption:

>   
| 

Q11

 | 

Why did you make the offer to split the money from Jansen Yee with Shukor and not IO Rhino?

 |
| 

A11

 | 

Shukor is considered a closer friend and colleague compared to IO Rhino. I worked with Shukor at the UMLS for quite a few years. I have never worked with IO Rhino before even though I knew him since my training days. … I only made the offer to Shukor because I trusted him more as compared to IO Rhino and I am less worried that he might reveal the agreement between me and Jansen to other people…

 |

  
  

109    In conclusion, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved each of the elements of JC1, TC1 and TC2 beyond reasonable doubt and I convicted Jensen and Tan of the respective charges against them.

## Sentencing

#### Submissions of parties - JC1, TC1 and TC2

110    The Prosecution submitted that the threshold for a custodial sentence was crossed as the offences related to, amongst others, a subversion of the administration of justice and could erode public confidence in the police. The offences were also particularly egregious as they were engendered by personal vendetta or for monetary gain and could have led to the wrongful curtailment of Hoon’s liberty without regard to proper police procedures.

111    Additionally, the Prosecution submitted that TC2 was relatively more serious than JC1 and TC1 even though the amount involved was half the amount in JC1 and TC1 because of the need to deter the corruption of public servants.

112    In this regard, the Prosecution sought the following sentences in relation to the corruption charges:

113    In support of its submissions, the Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents involving the offer of gratification to police officers which indicated a sentencing range of between 4 weeks and 3 months’ imprisonment where the offenders were seeking to be released from custody after they were arrested:

You should let me go. We can be friends. Next time you come to Malaysia I would take care of you. Still got good things.” And made a gesture with his hands.

In addition, the sentences also encapsulate the appropriate degree of opprobrium that such offences carry in Singapore. It is incontrovertible that corruption offences, if left unchecked, can quickly erode and eventually entirely undo the present work ethic of public servants as well as the institutional integrity of the enforcement agencies; matters that we now all take for granted as being part and parcel of the Singapore work environment.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">[19] The usual benchmark of a custodial sentence is only departed from where the facts</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">are exceptional. There are two reasons for this. First, the significance of deterrence as a sentencing consideration is particularly high for this genre of offences. It is crucial that the present ethical fabric and the integrity of the police force be scrupulously maintained. The public (Singaporeans and foreigners alike) must understand that offences of this nature, if allowed to take root, will quickly become endemic and be extremely difficult to, once again, bring under control, if not eradicate. It is not unimportant that such offences also undermine the proper administration of justice.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Second, the fact that such offences usually involve the giving of some consideration in exchange for the receipt of an advantage or benefit usually militates against the meting out of just a fine.

114    Jensen’s defence counsel sought a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment based on, amongst others, the following mitigating factors:

> (a)     Jensen had “extended his fullest cooperation to the authorities at all times” and had admitted to making the offer of $4,000 to Tan and that he wanted Hoon to be arrested.

> (b)     Jensen had no antecedents in Singapore or elsewhere.

119    Tan sought a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment for TC3.

#### The sentences

120    Law enforcement is a critical pillar of a modern society. Any form of erosion of confidence in the police would be detrimental to the safety and well-being of the people. As such, “\[a\]cts of corruption must be effectively and decisively dealt with. Otherwise, the very foundation of our country will be seriously undermined.”[^78]

121    In this regard, the comments of the Minister for Law, K Shanmugam in his speech at the Police Workplan 2018 are apposite:

> Technology, our tactics, our operations all have to operate within a context. That context has got to be favourable. And the favourable context is created by public trust. Without public trust, everything else becomes much, much more difficult. … And we have seen in other countries how easily trust in the Police can break down. When that happens, law and order breaks down too. … \[W\]e have been fortunate that people have trusted the entire system, and the Police force has then been able to ride on that by behaving well and being an effective force, and have gotten additional trust.

122    As such, where an offence is inimical to the public’s trust in the police, general deterrence is the paramount sentencing consideration.[^79]

123    In the present case, I was satisfied that the custodial threshold was crossed for TC2 as it involved a bribe offered to a police officer.

124    In the case of JC1 and TC1, even though the offer and acceptance of the bribe took place between private citizens, the underlying objective of the bribes was the wrongful arrest of a person through an intended abuse of police powers. There was a serious public element in the transactions for which deterrence would be a predominant sentencing consideration. As such, I was also satisfied that custodial sentences were appropriate for JC1 and TC1.

125    In calibrating the appropriate custodial sentences, the Prosecution suggested that the outcome sought to be achieved was more important than the quantum of the bribe. Indeed, it was not apparent from the sentencing precedents submitted by the Prosecution that there was necessarily a co-relation between the quantum of bribe and the sentence. In this regard, I was prepared to accept that there might be circumstances in which the outcome sought to be achieved was so egregious that it overshadowed the significance of the amount of bribe involved. However, as corruption offences could come in many different permutations, every case would have to be decided on its facts.

126    The Prosecution also submitted that the offer of a bribe for the unlawful arrest of a person was more aggravating than the offer of a bribe for a person to be released from custody after he was arrested. As I did not have the benefit of a broad spectrum of sentencing precedents, I was not prepared to accept this as a general principle. It might well be the case that the unlawful release from custody of a dangerous criminal could engender a more deleterious outcome than the unlawful arrest of an innocent man who was released after investigations exonerated him. After all, there are many stakeholders in the criminal justice system and the actions of a police officer will be subject to very close scrutiny by other stakeholders in the system. Nonetheless, there was no doubt that immense inconvenience would be suffered by an innocent man who was wrongfully arrested.

127    Turning back to the sentencing precedents, they provided a very useful reference point for sentencing. However, there were also important distinguishing factors in a number of them:

> (a)      _Lim Teck Choon’s_ case: Even though the accused had pleaded guilty, he had done so only during his cross-examination, which was a very late stage of the trial.

> (b)      _Chew Suang Heng’s_ case and _Gay Wee Keong Samuel’s_ case: The accused persons had persisted with their offers of bribes to the police officer after they were warned to desist.

> (c)      _Deng Zhifang’s_ case: The accused person had persisted with her offer of a bribe to the police officer and she also faced one other corruption charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

128    A common thread that ran through the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution was that the accused persons appeared to have offered the bribes on the spur of the moment after they were apprehended. In the present case, there was a degree of premeditation, planning and escalation of efforts to procure the wrongful arrest of Hoon. These were aggravating factors in the sentencing rubric.

129    Jensen’s defence counsel had mitigated on, amongst others, the basis that Jensen had cooperated with the authorities and had given an incriminating statement to the police (_ie._ Jensen’s Statement). However, I found this to be a neutral factor as Jensen had extensively challenged the purport of the statement throughout the trial.

130    I accepted the submission of the defence counsel that no harm was caused to Hoon in the present case. However, I was also mindful that this fortunate outcome was fortuitous as Shukor had turned down Tan’s offer..

131    In deciding on the appropriate sentences for the corruption charges, I considered that TC2 was generally analogous to the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution (where most of the offenders had pleaded guilty). All considered, and given the degree of pre-meditation and planning in the present case, I decided that a sentence at the higher end of the sentencing range was appropriate. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of **3 months’ imprisonment** on Tan for TC2.

132    In the case of JC1 and TC1, I accepted that the circumstances of the offences were less egregious than TC2 as the transactions took place between two private citizens. However, the ultimate objective was the wrongful arrest of a person through the circumvention of police procedures, arising out of Jensen’s personal vendetta against Hoon. I decided that a sentence of **2 months’ imprisonment** was appropriate.

133    Finally, as for TC3 that Tan pleaded guilty to, there were no particular aggravating or mitigating factors that justified a deviation from the usual sentencing tariff. As such, I imposed a sentence of **1 month’s imprisonment**.

134    I ordered the sentences for TC1 and TC2 to run concurrently, as they arose out of the same transaction. I further ordered these sentences to run consecutively with the sentence for TC3. Therefore, the global sentence for Tan was **4 months’ imprisonment**. Given the nature and circumstances of the offences, I was satisfied that the global sentence did not offend the totality principle.
