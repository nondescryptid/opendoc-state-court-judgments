Tort – Misrepresentation – Fraud and deceit

Civil Procedure – Pleadings

19 June 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### Magistrate Chua Wei Yuan:

## Facts

1       This trial concerns three investment schemes that turned sour. The plaintiff and defendant are acquaintances and, to some extent, investors. The interesting feature of these schemes is the way in which one comes to invest in them. In industry parlance, the “up-line” (in this case the defendant) recommends investments in schemes to the “down-line” (in this case the plaintiff) and receives a commission when the latter commits to such investments.

2       The plaintiff claims that she paid the defendant over S$40,000.00 for the purpose of investing in three schemes, namely “Silverstar”, “Cam Loto” and “Zero Space”, as a result of the defendant’s supposed fraudulent misrepresentations and concealment of facts. The plaintiff alleged:

> (a)     as regards Silverstar, that the defendant had said that:

>> (i)       she would “be able to profit the sum of S$5,000.00 and above every month”[^1] (“Item 1a”); and

>> (ii)       he would release 100 people to her (“Item 1b”).[^2]

> (b)     as regards Cam Loto, that the defendant:

>> (i)       had represented it as a low risk scheme (“Item 2a”);[^3]

>> (ii)       had said that it was “established with the knowledge of the Cambodia government and licensed to broadcast on official media” (“Item 2b”); and

>> (iii)       had guaranteed her “investment profits” under this scheme[^4] (“Item 2c”).

> (c)     as regards Zero Space, that the defendant had promised her “an immediate gain of USD6,000.00 on the very next day upon pumping in her capital”[^5] (“Item 3”).

> (d)     that the defendant did not disclose to her that these investments were “participated by” one “Simon” (“Item 4”), even though she had told him that she would not invest in any scheme “operated by” Simon.[^6] (Simon was another investor, known to both parties, and in whom the plaintiff had lost her trust, after she had lost money in investments that Simon had recommended.)

3       The plaintiff thus sued for “S$40,000.00 being part of the large sum previously paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant”.[^7] In opening, counsel for the plaintiff clarified that the action was brought in the tort of deceit (and not in contract), and that the sum claimed represents tortious damages (and not contractual damages or restitution consequent to rescission).[^8] The plaintiff has made no attempt to advance an alternative case of negligent misrepresentation.

## Decision

4       I dismiss the action with costs. My reasons follow.

### Fraud not pleaded

5       My foremost reason for dismissing the claim is one that pervades the entire claim: the plaintiff’s pleadings fell short of what is required in a claim in fraud.

6       Fraud must be distinctly alleged and proved, and cannot be left to mere inference (“_The Ohm Mariana” ex “Peony”; Pacific Navigation Co. Pte. Ltd. v. Owners of and All Other Persons Interested in the Ship or Vessel “Ohm Mariana” ex “Peony”_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 113</span>). The necessary particulars must also be given (O 18 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)). This is because fraud is a serious allegation, and the defendant cannot be prejudiced by not knowing the case he had to meet.

7       In this case, I did not consider that the plaintiff had distinctly alleged fraud in the statement of claim (“SOC”). **_First_**, no allegation of fraud was made in respect of Zero Space. **_Second_**, in all but one instances where some sort of fraud or cheating was alluded to, plaintiff pleaded that she _felt_ cheated. In my view, that was hardly a serious suggestion of fraud at best, and irrelevant at worst. **_Third_**, and more importantly, what little reasons the plaintiff offered for feeling (or having been) cheated were entirely consistent with non-fraudulent conduct. Specifically:

> (a)     In relation to Silverstar, the plaintiff said that she “feels cheated and that she had been misrepresented by the Defendant”, simply by virtue of the fact that she had not received the profit that she was told she would earn.[^9] Later on in the SOC, she emphasised that she “was also cheated by the Defendant in the Silverstar investment schemes, whereby the Defendant had promised a profit of S$5,000.00 per month but \[to date\] no such profits have been received by the Plaintiff”.[^10]

> (b)     In relation to Cam Loto, she said she “again feels cheated by the Defendant as he failed to fulfil his promises and representation of this scheme towards her”.[^11]

> (c)     In relation to Simon’s supposed participation in the above investments, the plaintiff said she “felt cheated by the Defendant for not disclosing” the fact that the investments were “participated by” Simon, or for “withholding such information from her”.[^12] There was no averment, for example, that the defendant had said that Simon was not participating in the investments, that the defendant was obligated to say whether he knew Simon to be participating in the investments, or even that the defendant knew whether Simon was participating in the investments at any time before the investments were entered.

8       The plaintiff submitted, relying on _The Dolphina_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 992</span> at \[193\]–\[197\] _per_ Belinda Ang J, that the word “fraud” or “deceit” need not be pleaded for a case of fraud to succeed. However, what sufficed there was the fact that the plaintiff had used synonyms or paraphrases: the plaintiff alleged that he had been “duped”, that the invoices were “bogus”, and that the relevant documents were not “genuine and valid”. Also on Ang J’s mind was the fact that the plaintiff faced the apparent problem of having to plead two mutually exclusive cases (_ie_, lawful and unlawful means conspiracy). The second concern is not live in this case. As for the first concern, the pleaded words (“feels cheated”) and the reasons (_ie_, reasons consistent with non-fraudulent conduct) are quite different from those pleaded in _The Dolphina_ in terms of severity and specificity.

9       For completeness, I do not think the plaintiff can succeed even if I accept that the court may make findings on unpleaded matters if they had been engaged by counsel in evidence, or if doing so would not prejudice the other party. For a start, I would be slow to apply such a principle in the context of a claim in fraud. More importantly, this was not a case where the pleading point had been waived. In the opening statement and twice in opening submissions, counsel for the defendant highlighted the pleading issue,[^13] but counsel for the plaintiff did not seek to amend the pleadings at any stage. I would therefore consider any oral examination on the issue of fraud to have been conducted under protest or, in the alternative, possibly less complete than it would have been had the plaintiff pleaded full particulars of fraud.

10     On this basis alone, the plaintiff is not entitled to prove fraud, and her claim must be dismissed.

### Problems with each specific allegation

11     In the event I am wrong on the pleading point, I will examine the other issues, specific to each alleged misrepresentation or the non-disclosure, that collectively compel me to dismiss the entire claim. These run the gamut from procedural/pleading points to substantive issues as regards the law on misrepresentation to evidential problems.

#### Item 1a (Silverstar: promised monthly profit of $5,000.00)

12     Item 1a concerns the defendant’s supposed representation that the plaintiff would profit $5,000.00 per month upon investing in Silverstar.

13     Before I discuss the problems proper, I observe that Item 1a was not pleaded clearly. The pleadings gave the impression that the plaintiff claimed to have been promised a profit _on the investment_ of $5,000.00 per month. However, having heard the evidence, I do not think either party understood the alleged representation to have had such a meaning. Instead, what it broadly seems to mean is that the plaintiff claims to have been promised $5,000 per month _in commissions from down-lines_ in respect of this investment. (Of course, there are problems with such a formulation, and I address them below at \[24\].) My analysis below assumes that, as a matter of pleading, the plaintiff is not precluded from proving that such a representation was made.

14     The **_first_** fatal problem with Item 1a is that it is not an actionable representation as to existing fact because it is a statement as to the _future_ (see, _eg_, _Tan Chin Seng v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 307</span> at \[17\]–\[21\]). Such a statement can only be a promise. Although it is actionable if incorporated as a term of a contract, such a case has not been advanced before me.

15     I can accept for the sake of argument that a statement as to future matters _can_ carry two implied statements of fact, specifically, that the defendant honestly believed or expected that such matter will happen in the future, and that he had reasonable grounds for saying so (_The Law of Contract in Singapore_ (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 11.034, citing _Bank Leumi Le Israel BM v British National Insurance Co Ltd_ \[1988\] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 71 at 75 and _Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH, The Mihalis Angelos_ <span class="citation">\[1971\] 1 QB 164</span> at 194, 197 and 204). However, the plaintiff did not plead or depose that the defendant impliedly made either statement. Neither did the plaintiff plead or depose that the defendant had no such belief/expectation, or no such grounds for that belief/expectation.

16      **_Second_**, even if these implied representations had been made, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that they were fraudulent.

17     A representation is fraudulent if it is made **(1)** knowingly, **(2)** without belief in its truth, or **(3)** recklessly, without caring whether it is true or false (_William Derry and others v Sir Henry William Peek_ <span class="citation">(1889) 14 App Cas 337</span> (“_Derry_”) at 374 _per_ Lord Herschell; _Panatron Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 435</span> (CA) (“_Panatron_”) at \[13\] _per_ L P Thean JA (delivering the judgment of the court)). Cogent evidence is required to prove fraud given its serious implications (_Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 308</span> (CA) (“_Alwie Handoyo_”) at \[161\] _per_ V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the court)).

18     The evidence in this case could be summed up as being largely one person’s word against the other’s. The plaintiff tendered a single piece of documentary evidence in support of her claim—a translated transcript of a recorded conversation between the parties of an unknown date. The most relevant part reads as follows:

>   
| 

\[Plaintiff (“P”)\]:

 | 

… you shouldn’t continue to lie to me about having at least $5,000 every month.

 |
| 

\[Defendant (“D”)\]:

 | 

What is it? Silver Star?

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

You lied to me again about Silver Star and the $5,000.

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

No, so what is the deal about Silver Star? Because at the time, they changed … When did you enter? I forgot. It was roughly…

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

I did not enter for a long time. I told you that it was very little money and I did not want to enter. I insisted in not entering, but you kept telling me that I will give you at least $5,000, and I will release 100 people to you. You said at least 100 people, but what happened in the end?

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

I know, I know.

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

You did not manage to do the two things — $5,000 and the 100 people. You did not manage to do all those things. … it was because you promised me and that is why I entered. Is this the case?

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

Mm.

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

Did I get anything wrong? If you did not promise me, I would not have entered right? It was because you promised me and guaranteed that you would introduce this number of people and that I would earn a certain amount, and that is why I entered. Am I right?

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

Mm.

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

So isn’t this considered deception?

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

**It is not deception. It is a white lie. No, it’s not a lie. It’s … how should I put it? It’s the plans that cannot catch up to the changes. It was originally planned, but suddenly there was something that happened.** So I also don’t want to explain to you what has happened. You would be like this doesn’t concern me.

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

I don’t even know the nature of the thing.

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

Right, and that is why I want to explain to you. Anyway, it has caused this thing to change. That’s it. Regardless, I have told you that over his side, he would already have … Silver Star right? He would …

 |
| 

\[emphasis added in bold\]

19     In these passages, I do not think that the defendant can be said to have admitted without qualification that he did not honestly believe, or had no reasonable basis to believe, that the plaintiff would earn $5,000 per month upon investing in Silverstar, either in commission from down-lines or on the investment itself.

20     The defendant explained in cross-examination that he had said that if the plaintiff invested in Silverstar, he would try his best to procure 100 down-lines for her so that she could earn commissions from their investment. The commission earned would be a variable percentage of a down-line’s investment, ranging from 8% for a $1,000 investment (_ie_, $80) to 12% for a $30,000 investment (_ie_, $3,600).[^14] On his expectation that each of the plaintiff’s would-be down-lines would earn her an average of $1,000 in commission, and that it would be easy to get five such down-lines each month, he said that she could earn at least $5,000 per month in commission. He also gave affidavit evidence to the effect that Silverstar had suffered losses and he became unable to deliver on his estimates or promises.[^15] I do not find these explanations inherently incredible.

21     As the plaintiff did not clearly state when the representation was supposedly made and when she supposedly parted with her money, I cannot conclude on a balance of probabilities that the defendant stated that the plaintiff would earn $5,000 in commission per month upon investing in Silverstar at a time when he had neither an honest belief in it nor reasonable grounds to believe in it.

22     On these grounds, a misrepresentation claim based on Item 1a must fail.

#### Item 1b (Silverstar: releasing 100 people to the plaintiff)

23     Item 1b concerns the defendant’s supposed representation that he would release 100 people to the plaintiff upon her investing in Silverstar. It suffers from three fatal defects.

24      **_First_**, it is too uncertain to be a representation of fact that I can find to be false. It is unclear whether “release” means: does it mean that the defendant will _introduce_ 100 people to the plaintiff with a view to them being down-lines (regardless of how many actually do become her down-lines), that the defendant _warrants_ that the plaintiff will have 100 down-lines (regardless of who caused them to be down-lines), that the defendant _will cause_ the plaintiff to have 100 down-lines (regardless of how many other down-lines the plaintiff can get), or that the defendant will _cede_ 100 of his own down-lines to the plaintiff? By when must this 100 people be “released”? The plaintiff did not specify.

25     When there is ambiguity, the plaintiff must produce evidence as to the sense in which she understood it. Otherwise, the court cannot find that the statement is false (_Chuan Bee Realty Pte Ltd v Teo Chee Yeow Aloysius_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 134</span> at \[18\]). At best, the plaintiff is still required to prove that the statement—even in the sense most generous to the defendant—is false. This the plaintiff has not done, because the plaintiff did not specify a time by which the 100 down-lines had to be “released”. Accordingly, I am unable to find that this statement is false.

26      **_Second_**, it was unpleaded. There was no hint of this representation—in any of its possible senses—in the SOC or the plaintiff’s affidavit evidence. It was first raised only in closing submissions. The plaintiff is therefore not entitled to prove misrepresentation based on this statement.

27      **_Third_**, like Item 1a (discussed above at \[14\]–\[15\]), Item 1b is not a statement as to existing fact and therefore cannot be an actionable misrepresentation.

28     On these grounds, a misrepresentation claim based on Item 1b must fail.

#### Item 2a (Cam Loto: being low risk)

29     Item 2a concerns the defendant’s supposed representation that Cam Loto is an investment with low risk.[^16]

30      **_First_**, the words “low risk”, without more, is too uncertain to be a representation of fact. In particular, practically nothing is known as to the plaintiff’s risk appetite.

31      **_Second_**, the representation is not borne out on the pleadings or the evidence. The plaintiff pleaded in the SOC:

> 9.    The Plaintiff relying on the Defendant’s representation and the low risk factor of the scheme as she believes it was the Cambodia’s government initiative, had thereafter invested into the same. …

She then deposed the following affidavit evidence:

> 20.    I wish to say that again, because of the trust I had with the Defendant as a friend above our relationship of an Up-Line and Down-Line, I believed that this was a low risk scheme and thus invested in it.

As a matter of simple grammar, nothing above says that the defendant had represented that the Cam Loto investment was low risk. In the SOC, the low risk factor appeared to be an assessment (for whatever reason) objectively arrived at, based on the plaintiff’s belief that it was an initiative by the Cambodian government. In the affidavit, a different reason was given for believing that this was a low-risk investment—the plaintiff’s trust in the defendant borne of friendship. These are not consonant.

32     For completeness, I think that the plaintiff cannot succeed even if it argued that Cam Loto was not, contrary to the defendant’s representation, a government initiative. The evidence does not prove that Cam Loto was represented to have been a Cambodian government _initiative_, as the plaintiff deposed that Cam Loto was only represented to have been _established with the knowledge of_ the Cambodian government. And, as I explain below, the plaintiff fails to establish that Cam Loto was not in fact established with the Cambodian government’s knowledge.

33      **_Third_**, even if the plaintiff could be taken to have pleaded that the defendant had represented Cam Loto as being low risk, she did not plead or demonstrate that Cam Loto was in fact not low risk, for example. The mere fact that Cam Loto failed is, in my judgment, insufficient to show that it was not low risk. It can only show that Cam Loto was not risk-free.

34     On these grounds, a misrepresentation claim based on Item 2a must fail.

#### Item 2b (Cam Loto: being state-sanctioned)

35     Item 2b concerns the defendant’s supposed representation that Cam Loto was “established with the knowledge of the Cambodia government and licensed to broadcast on official media”.

36     The plaintiff did not plead or demonstrate that such a claim was false. In fact, it seems to me that such a claim was in fact true. The defendant exhibited what he says are slides which he used to brief the plaintiff. Some of the slides contain what appear to be screenshots of television broadcasts. The commentary on the slide indicates that these are live broadcasts, on the CTV9 television channel, of programmes in connection with Cam Loto. The natural inference is that there is a licence to broadcast on official media. Some of the slides exhibit certificates of incorporation, issued by the Ministry of Commerce of the Kingdom of Cambodia, to some companies that appear to be associated with the scheme. This seems to satisfy the claim that the scheme was established with the knowledge of the Cambodia government, in the absence of any further details from the plaintiff as to what exactly was meant by a claim that a scheme was “established with the knowledge of the Cambodia government”.

37     The defendant took issue with this evidence in two ways. _First_, she objected to the certificates on the basis that they were not translated in compliance with O 92 r 1. However, in some cases, the document may be predominantly in the English language such that a translation certificate is unnecessary (_Solomon Alliance Management Pte Ltd v Pang Chee Kuan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 139</span> at \[122\] _per_ Aedit Abdullah J). In this case, I need only rely on the English words on the document to infer that it is some sort of certificate of incorporation; I do not think I am required to disregard the entire document. _Second_, she also claimed that she had never seen any of these slides or brochures before the action. However, this is a weak objection because what matters is whether the representation was true, and not whether the basis for the representation had been communicated to the plaintiff at the time the representation was made. Even if her point was that these slides were afterthoughts or manufactured to defend this claim, the defendant had no evidence at all to even suggest the contrary. I have no basis to find that the plaintiff has established that this statement was false and fraudulently made.

38     On this ground, a misrepresentation claim based on Item 2b must fail.

#### Item 2c (Cam Loto: yielding investment profits)

39     Item 2c concerns the defendant’s supposed representation that the plaintiff was guaranteed investment profits in Cam Loto. It suffers from two defects.

40      **_First_**, like Item 1a (discussed above at \[14\]–\[15\]), Item 2c is not a statement as to existing fact and therefore cannot be an actionable misrepresentation.

41      **_Second_**, the phrase “investment profits” is too uncertain, because it is unclear what constitutes investment profits. The plaintiff certainly did not show that it was false in every possible sense. On the contrary, the plaintiff seems to have conceded in cross-examination that she had received returns on her investment in Cam Loto in accordance with what the defendant had promised.[^17] At any rate, she conceded receiving certain sums of money on her investment in Cam Loto.[^18]

42     On these grounds, a misrepresentation claim based on Item 2c must fail.

#### Item 3 (Zero Space)

43     Item 3 concerns the defendant’s supposed representation that the plaintiff would have “an immediate gain of USD6,000.00 on the very next day upon pumping in her capital” in Zero Space.[^19]

44      **_First_**, like Item 1a (discussed above at \[14\]–\[15\]), Item 3 is not a statement as to existing fact and therefore cannot be an actionable misrepresentation.

45      **_Second_**, the plaintiff did not specify what a “gain” of USD 6,000.00 meant. The word “gain” can mean a cash gain or it may also mean a paper gain. Again, the plaintiff did not specify. The defendant explained that if the plaintiff made the investment within a certain period, a notional USD 6,000.00 would be added on to the value of her investment. Such a gain was said to have been recorded on the books, but the plaintiff did not realise it because she did not sell her investment before the scheme failed.

46     The plaintiff also relied on a portion of the transcription of the conversation, presumably to establish that the representation was made and that it was false:

>   
| 

\[Plaintiff (“P”)\]:

 | 

You told me – I did not say anything. You told me that if I enter now, I have a way to enable you to earn $6,000 immediately.

 |
| 

\[Defendant (“D”)\]:

 | 

Right. Wait a minute.

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

Did you tell me this before you …

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

It’s true. It’s true. It’s true.

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

Yes, so $10,000 would become $16,000. That is earning money immediately.

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

Right.

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

That would be earning money immediately. **Then you told me to wait one or two months and I would earn double of that. Did you say this?**

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

**Yes.**

 |
| 

\[P\]:

 | 

**When two months is up, you asked me to wait for one more month. Do you know how long this has been dragging since I have been listening to you?**

 |
| 

\[D\]:

 | 

**I know.**

 |

  
  

47     Never mind the fact that Zero Space is not mentioned by name. It is unclear to me what this passage achieves. It does not clearly show that the plaintiff did not earn the $6,000 promised. If anything, it shows that the plaintiff wished to make further profits by leaving her investment as it was. And, if that turned out to be a bad suggestion, it was not part of the complaints raised in this claim. I certainly cannot find that this statement was false and fraudulently made.

48     On these grounds, a misrepresentation claim based on Item 3 must fail.

#### Item 4 (material non-disclosure of Simon’s involvement)

49     Item 4 concerns the defendant’s supposed failure to disclose that these investments were “participated by” Simon, even though the plaintiff had told the defendant that she would not invest in any scheme “operated by” Simon.[^20]

50      **_First_**, the pleadings are insufficient. On one hand, the plaintiff pleaded that the schemes were “participated by” Simon,[^21] and deposed that the schemes “had \[Simon’s\] involvement in it”.[^22] On the other hand, she pleaded only that she had told the defendant she was not interested in and would not invest in schemes “operated by” Simon. In my understanding, operating a scheme denotes some form of control as vendor or administrator. Even on the most generous interpretation I can think of, it would entail being someone’s up-line. On the other hand, participation or involvement can be entirely passive, that is, as a subscriber or a mere down-line. At any rate, participating or being involved in the scheme is quite different from operating the scheme. On such a reading of the pleadings, the plaintiff is not entitled to prove either (i) that she had said that she would not invest in any scheme in which Simon was involved even as investor; or (ii) that Simon was an operator of the scheme.

51     Strictly speaking, the plaintiff’s affidavit evidence in this regard went beyond her pleadings where she said she was “disinterested and \[would\] not want to have a hand in any investment schemes with \[Simon’s\] involvement”.[^23] The plaintiff is not entitled to prove—and I do not find—that she had said this.

52      **_Second_**, in any event, Item 4 cannot amount to an actionable misstatement in this case. The law on misrepresentation distinguishes misstatements and non-disclosures. Generally, no party is obligated to disclose material facts known to him but not to the other party. The law may impose a duty to disclose either in certain settings which demand utmost good faith (_eg_, insurance contracts) or where non-disclosure renders what had been represented earlier misleading or false (_eg_, where facts have changed due to intervening events). However, the plaintiff did not establish that this case fell into any such category. The mere fact that the plaintiff informed the defendant that she was not interested in and would not make any investments operated by a person does not, in my judgment, create a duty to disclose. Exuberant salesmen often try to sell things despite the prospective buyer having expressed disinterest in it. It would have been easy for the plaintiff to have asked if the three schemes (or, perhaps, even any of the schemes which the defendant had been or would be promoting) were operated by Simon. If the defendant had denied it, then there is perhaps a misrepresentation.

53     The plaintiff submits that there was a relationship of complete and unquestioning trust and confidence in this case because, _first_, the plaintiff considered the defendant to be her friend; _second_, she depended solely on the defendant for information to make an informed decision on the investments; and _third_, the plaintiff trusted him enough to hand him tens of thousands of dollars in cash.[^24] Further, the plaintiff relies on _Sabyasachi Mukherjee and another v Pradeepto Kumar Biswas and another suit_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 271</span> (“_Mukherjee_”) at \[262\] to say that where the defendant knew of the plaintiff’s investment requirements, it would be incumbent on the defendant not to make any misstatements, or to recommend a highly risky investment without saying that it was such.[^25]

54     I accept none of these arguments. The first three reasons offered by the plaintiff merely demonstrate the plaintiff’s subjective state of mind; it does not tell me what the defendant said or did to enter that relationship of trust such that he became duty-bound to make the disclosures in question. As for _Mukherjee_, it went beyond the orthodox position for the simple reason that the defendant there undertook fiduciary obligations in the plaintiffs’ favour (see \[20\]–\[63\]). Notably, the parties there had dealings spanning over a decade and 700 investments, and the defendant there had leveraged on his credibility as the plaintiffs’ investment adviser of their bank to assume a second role—an intermediary offering non-bank investment opportunities. (To be sure, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J clarified at \[262\] that the same findings of fact for the cause of action in breach of fiduciary duty were relevant and applied equally to that in deceit.) All of this is absent from the present case.

55      **_Third_**, the evidence is insufficient to establish fraudulent non-disclosure in respect of all three investments. Simon was a mere investor in Zero Space,[^26] with not even any suggestion that Simon was a vendor/administrator or an up-line. There is no evidence that he was in any way connected with Silverstar or Cam Loto.

56     On these grounds, a misrepresentation or non-disclosure claim based on Item 4 must fail.

### All-or-nothing claim

57     In the event that I am wrong on some but not all of the issues listed above, there is still reason to dismiss the entire claim.

58     In what is often called an “all-or-nothing” claim (_ie_, where the plaintiff claims a specific relief and _only_ such relief), the court either that relief claimed or it dismisses the claim; it does not grant what the plaintiff does not ask for. This strict principle is demonstrated by _Edmund Tie & Co (SEA) Pte Ltd v Savills Residential Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 349</span> (“_Edmund Tie_”). There, parties were in dispute as to whose version of the contract represented the agreement between them. Choo Han Teck J held that the district judge, having found in favour of the defendant’s version of the contract, correctly dismissed the plaintiff’s all-or-nothing claim for $13,385.70 (based on her version of the contract), despite the defendant’s concession that $6,255 was due to the plaintiff (based on his version of the contract).

59     In this case, the plaintiff’s claim for “S$40,000.00 being part of the large sum previously paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant” is in my view a typical “all-or-nothing” claim. Unless the plaintiff shows that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in the sum of at least SGD 40,000.00—and I do not think the plaintiff will have done so if any of my concerns above at \[12\]–\[56\] hold true— the court will have to dismiss the claim.

### Claim too uncertain to give relief

60     Finally, even if there is some basis for me to hold the defendant liable in fraudulent misrepresentation, there are still uncertainties that prevent me from awarding any proper relief.

61     In this regard, the plaintiff’s SOC and evidence were riddled with gaps, ambiguities, or inconsistencies that I could not overlook. Chief among them was the plaintiff’s hopeless lack of clarity as to how much money and in what currency she had paid the defendant.

62     In the SOC, the plaintiff clearly averred that all monies paid as capital were in USD.[^27] However, she did not state how much money she had paid. The only clue was found in the final paragraph, where the she claimed SGD 40,000.00, being part of the sum she had paid the defendant. In cross-examination, she claimed that she had paid “50,000 plus”,[^28] although she did not state in what currency. Neither of these are consonant with her affidavit evidence that she had paid “approximately S$40,000.00 as the principal investment sum”.[^29]

63     Only in re-examination did counsel ask the plaintiff about the breakdown of the SGD 40,000.00 she had claimed. While the plaintiff insisted that she paid the defendant in SGD,[^30] she could not even state properly how much money she had paid in respect of each of the three investments. On the most charitable interpretation of what the plaintiff was trying to convey, she could be said to have given the impression that she had paid the defendant the SGD equivalent of what the investment was worth in its original currency, adjusted for some discount which the defendant had offered (such that the defendant could invest on her behalf). Even so, she only claimed that she had paid SGD 16,000 each for two USD-denominated investments, and SGD 17,000 for a EUR-denominated investment. And, such a claim also has its problems. _First_, she did not identify which investment(s) was/were supposedly EUR- or USD-denominated, and the defendant countered that all the investments in issue were USD-denominated. _Second_, even on such an interpretation, the sum total paid would have been SGD 49,000.00, which was inconsistent both with the “50,000 plus” and the “approximately S$40,000.00” she said she had paid the defendant.

64     I therefore have no way of satisfying myself as to how much the plaintiff had actually paid the defendant for each investment, or that she did in fact pay a total of more than SGD 40,000.00 for the purpose of the three investments. I therefore find myself unable to make any meaningful award of damages should the plaintiff succeed on her complaints.

## Concluding remarks

65     In the circumstances, I must dismiss the claim.

66     As a final remark, I do not quite get the impression that the defendant was a well-meaning friend. He obviously stood to gain financially if he made down-lines of others. So he did just that. And, as with some in his business, he in doing so appealed to peer pressure,[^31] fear of missing out[^32] and greed.[^33] However, I cannot believe that the plaintiff was as naïve as she sometimes tried to portray herself to be. She, too, has made down-lines of others, including the defendant.[^34] She also has had her fair share of unpleasant experiences like losing money on earlier investments, and should therefore be well aware of how risky such investments can be. Ultimately, this case was lost neither on the defendant’s cunning nor on the plaintiff’s naïveté. Instead, it was undone by the way the plaintiff’s case was pleaded and run. I hope that my decision underscores the importance of well-written pleadings but, more importantly, that it serves as a reminder of the need to be prudent when investing in the first place.

67     I will hear parties on costs.
