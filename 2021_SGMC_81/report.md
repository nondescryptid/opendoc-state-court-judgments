### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The complainant is Helen Lee Hai Loon. She resides in a level one unit in a development known at 57 Citylife@Tampines located at Tampines Central 7 Singapore. The respondent is Lee Soh Geok. She resides in the same development and her unit is located at level two and directly over the complainant’s residence.

2       On 10 June 2020, the complainant lodged a Magistrate’s Complaint against the respondent for offences under ss 3, 4 and 5 of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed)(“POHA”) namely, for splashing dirty water from her balcony into her unit and for bouncing a basketball in her unit causing the complainant to feel harassed and distressed.

3       On 9 October 2020, pursuant to a private summons, PS 900028- 2020 issued by the complainant, the respondent attended Court 4B to answer to three charges under s 4(1)_(a)_ POHA in MSC 902556-2020 to MSC 902558- 2020 preferred against her. The matter was fixed for hearing after the respondent claimed trial to all three charges. The complainant was represented by Mr Luke Lee of Messrs Luke Lee & Co while the respondent acted in person.

4       At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Upon delivering brief oral grounds for my decision to find her guilty, the respondent was convicted on 1 September 2021. On the same day, I imposed a fine of $3,500 for each charge in default ten days imprisonment. The global fine imposed was $10,500 in default 30 days’ imprisonment. The respondent being dissatisfied with my decision has filed an appeal against both her conviction and sentence. She has paid the fine in full.

5       I now set out the grounds of my decision in full. 

## The Charges

## Complainant's Case

7       It was the complainant’s case that the respondent’s acts of splashing wastewater from her residence onto the complainant’s roof extension as well as the respondent’s acts of bouncing a ball within her unit amounted to abusive behaviour which had caused harassment and distress to the complainant.

## Respondent’s case

8       It was the respondent’s case that her conduct of splashing wastewater from her balcony onto the complainant’s roof extension and bouncing a basketball within her unit were for a reasonable purpose.

## Undisputed facts

9       The undisputed in the present case are as follows:

> (a)     The complainant’s fixed roof extension was installed in 2016 before her family moved into their unit at level one;

> (b)     The respondent has been pouring water from her residence onto the complainant’s roof extension for the past five years;

> (c)     The respondent poured soapy wastewater containing Dettol, an antiseptic cleaner from her residence onto the complainant’s roof extension from 29 January 2019 to 14 June 2019, on 31 December 2019 as well as from 16 January 2020 to 21 May 2020. The complainant had recorded her doing the act 123 times as set out in P4;

> (d)     The complainant subsequently installed blinds and an acrylic skirting at their private enclosed space (“PES”) to prevent the water poured by the respondent from seeping in;

> (e)     The respondent had been bouncing a basketball ball within her residence from 25 April 2020 to 22 May 2020 and the complainant had recorded her doing the act 39 times as set out in P4;

> (f)     When the complainant’s husband went to her unit and requested the respondent to stop the pounding noise from the bouncing of the basketball, the respondent told him that as this was her house, she could do whatever she wanted;

> (g)     The complainant filed 12 police reports from 29 January 2019 to 2 June 2020 against the respondent regarding her actions. No follow-up action was taken by the police against the respondent;

> (h)     Circuit breaker measures were implemented in Singapore from 7 April 2020 to 1 June 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The measures included the closure of workplace premises and full home-based learning for schools. Members of the public were strongly advised to stay at home and avoid going out unnecessarily except to purchase daily necessities, essential services or for urgent medical needs. Members of the public who needed to exercise were advised to do so on their own, around their immediate neighbourhood in open, uncrowded places;

> (i)     During the circuit breaker period, the complainant, her husband and her two children were at home due to the closure of workplace premises and full home-based learning for schools;

> (j)     On 1 October 2019, the respondent filed an application against the Management Corporation Strata plan No. 4417 (“the MST”) of the development. One of the orders sought by the respondent was for the fixed non-combustible aluminium composite panel covers _ie_ fixed awnings within the estate to be removed and replaced with retractable awnings. On 7 September 2020, the Strata Title Board had dismissed this aspect of the claim against the MCST.

## Issues

10     The main issues before me were:

> (a)     Whether the acts allegedly committed by the respondent contravened s 4(1)_(a)_ of the POHA;

> (b)     Whether the respondent’s conduct was reasonable.

## Assessment of the evidence

#### General observation of the case

11     The present case involves a neighbourly dispute between two subsidiary proprietors in the CityLife@Tampines development. It was clear from the evidence before me that the respondent who lived directly above the complainant and her family was unhappy with the fixed roof extension that was installed over the complainant’s unit.

12     The respondent’s position was that the fixed roof extension was unauthorised as it was installed without the necessary by-law allowing for its installation. She was also of the view that the roof extension was dirty and had not been properly cleaned by the complainant. As such, she decided to take matters in her own hands by cleaning the complainant’s roof extension herself using soapy water.

13     In respect of her act of bouncing a basketball within her own unit, the respondent had done so during the circuit breaker period of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the circuit breaker period, members of the public who needed to exercise were advised to do so on their own, around their immediate neighbourhood in open, uncrowded places.

## Whether the acts allegedly committed by the respondent contravened the POHA

14     In order to prove its case on the proceeded charges, the complainant led evidence from three witnesses while the respondent was the only witness for the Defence. In order to determine whether the complainant had established its case for all three charges beyond a reasonable doubt, I had carefully examined both the oral and documentary evidence produced before me by both parties.

#### Abusive behaviour

15     It is the complainant’s case that the respondent’s actions were abusive although the respondent contends otherwise. For the respondent’s actions to amount to a contravention of s 4(1)_(a)_ of POHA, the actions must be seen or perceived by the complainant and likely to cause her harassment, alarm or distress.

16     Although what actions amounts to abusive behaviour is not defined in within the Act, I agreed with Mr Luke Lee that the ordinary meaning as defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary _ie_ using or involving physical violence or emotional cruelty would apply. I was also of the view that the alternative definition of such behaviour being characterised by wrong or improper use or action would also apply.

17     The complainant had given direct evidence of the various occasions when the respondent had splashed soapy wastewater onto her roof extension. She had given further evidence that the various acts were done at various times of the day including the early hours of the morning and at times on more than one occasion within the day. According to the complainant, the respondent had used various coloured pails, a cooking pot, a metal scoop to splash water onto the roof extension. The water would then drip onto the complainant’s railings, her blinds, the patio, the gate, her plants and the walkway outside the unit. According to her, these acts had caused harassment and distress to her and her family.

18     She had testified that the various occasions when the respondent had bounced the basketball within her own unit had similarly caused harassment and distress to the complainant and her family. According to her, the bouncing started during the circuit breaker period when everyone was locked down at home and her children had home based schooling. She had further testified that the various acts were done at various times of the day and at times on more than one occasion within the day. When the respondent had done so during her children’s dinner time, she had to resort to using headphones on them to cut off the noise and to alleviate their distress.

19     I found that her evidence was internally consistent with the 12 police reports in P2 that she had lodged against the respondent as well as the handwritten records of the respondent’s actions she had noted down as soon as it happened in P3.

#### Extrinsic evidence

20     On the facts, I found that the complainant’s evidence was further corroborated by the evidence of her husband, PW2 and her neighbour, PW3. PW3 testified that she had witnessed some of the respondent’s actions and had provided photographs as well as footages to corroborate the complainant’s case. I considered the fact that PW2 had approached the respondent in respect of her actions but was rebuffed by the respondent who felt entitled to act as she pleased within the bounds of her own home.

21     In addition to the direct evidence from PW2 and PW3, I found that the complainant’s allegations against the respondent was corroborated by the objective evidence from the various stills and footages that were tendered in court. Applying the objective standard of a reasonable person on the present case, I found that it is highly likely that the respondent’s behaviour would cause harassment and distress to the complainant.

22     Based on the above, I was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the respondent’s course of conduct amounted to abusive behaviour within the meaning of the Act.

## Whether the respondent’s conduct was reasonable

23     My findings that the respondent’s conduct amounted to abusive behaviour can be negated if the respondent could establish that her conduct was reasonable in the circumstances.

24     In my determination of this issue, I was guided by the High Court case of _Benber Dayao Yu v Jacter Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 316</span> at \[43\] where it was held:

> 43 Moving to the second stage of the inquiry, this pertained to whether the respondent had shown that his conduct was reasonable. It must be said that what amounts to reasonable conduct is heavily fact-specific and dependent on the unique circumstances of each case. In responding to questions from the members of the House on the Protection from Harassment Bill, Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam outlined some factors that should be considered when determining the reasonableness of conduct.

> (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (13 March 2014) vol 91):

>> … Reasonableness of conduct is a defence to all of the offences under the Bill and the Court will have to consider, inter alia: the nature of the allegedly offending act in question; the context in which those acts occurred; and the effect of those actions on the victim … \[emphasis added\]

> I found these factors, namely the nature and context of the offending acts along with their effect on the victim, to be apposite to consider in the present case.

25     In the present case, the respondent testified that the complainant’s roof extension had contravened the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (“BMSMA”). She also testified that the complainant should have been responsible for the daily cleaning of her roof extension as the respondent had found it to be dirty from the accumulated debris and bird droppings. She was also of the view that the cleaning of the roof extension should have been done on a daily basis and not on an annual basis.

26     The respondent gave evidence that she had been cleaning the roof extension for the past five years. According to her, she had only done basic cleaning and there was no other means to do so except through liquid. The respondent also testified that she had done in the evening and in the early hours because she was suffering from insomnia caused by the whining of a puppy. I noted that when confronted by Mr Luke Lee over the lack of evidence showing that the complainant’s roof extension was dirty, her response was that it was due to the angle the photographs were taken.

27     The respondent gave evidence that she had used the basketball to exercise as during the circuit breaker period, the amenities within the development such as the swimming pool and the gym were closed. She had nowhere to go to work out and she was stuck in the house. She resorted to bouncing the basketball as a form of exercise and to work the negative energy out of her body.

28     In the present case, while the respondent may have been unhappy or angered by the installation of the roof extension over the complainant’s unit, I found that her deliberate acts of splashing soapy wastewater from her residence onto the complainant’s roof extension at various times of the day and deliberately bouncing a ball such that unreasonable noise was created from her residence into the complainant’s residence was clearly unjustified and unreasonable.

29     Furthermore, there was no objective evidence before me in support of the respondent’s assertion that the roof extension posed a health hazard or that her indiscriminate actions of splashing unclean or wastewater from her residence was the proper and reasonable way to clean such roof extensions.

30     The respondent ought to have considered other proper means to resolve her unhappiness with the complainant instead of taking matters into her own hands. As subsidiary proprietors in the same development, it is in the respondent’s interest to maintain a civil and cordial relationship with others living in the same development.

31     Further, I did not accept her claim that she had done so for her own personal body health as she could have chosen alternatives means of exercising without being anti-social and disruptive to her immediate neighbour below. I was mindful the respondent had persisted with her anti-social behaviour despite the complainant’s husband visiting her and informing her of the adverse effects of her actions on his family.

32     The nature and context of the respondent’s actions clearly showed that they could not be regarded as reasonable conduct by any measure. I found that the respondent had gone too far in her actions. In the circumstances of the present case, I was unable to accept that the respondent was justified in her course of conduct towards the complainant.

33     In addition, it must be emphasized that this Court is not the proper forum for the respondent to raise the various claims of illegality or non-compliance with the various regulations in respect of the said roof extension against the complainant.

34     Based on the above, I am satisfied that the respondent had contravened s 4(1)_(a)_ of the POHA in respect of all three charges. I also found that the respondent has not established the defence of reasonable conduct based on the totality of the evidence before me.

## Conclusion

35     In summary, the Respondent had not succeeded in establishing a defence of reasonable conduct.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

36     The prescribed penalty for the present charges under s 4(2) POHA is a fine not exceeding $5,000.

### Antecedents

37     The respondent had no antecedents.

### Submissions on Sentence

38     Mr Luke Lee had submitted for the imposition of a high fine of $4,000 as a form of general and specific deterrence against the respondent. Although three charges had been framed, the respondent had committed multitudinous acts, each was likely to cause harassment and distress to the complainant.

39     It was submitted that the fact that such acts also adversely affected the children and the complainant’s husband meant that the effects of the harassment and distress on the complainant was magnified. The fact that despite the respondent continued such acts despite requests for her to stop such acts, necessarily caused further harassment and distress to the complainant. She had perceived hopelessness to relief from her situation and this prosecution was brought to put a stop to the acts of the respondent.

40     It was highlighted that although P4 is serially numbered to 79, in fact there were 123 separate acts of splashing water and 39 separate acts of causing noise by bouncing the basketball. The circuit breaker rules continued from 2 April 2020 when they were first implemented to 1 June 2020 had an amplified impact on the complainant as she (and her family) were directly impacted by the noise and vibration created by the respondent. They had nowhere to go but to suffer the harassment and distress. The acts of splashing water in the early hours of the morning when the complainant was asleep would have likely caused her immediate harassment and distress.

41     Despite the private prosecution and the fact that the respondent had committed 123 acts of water splashing and 39 acts of bouncing a basketball, the respondent continues to remain defiant. It was submitted that this egregious behaviour showed an absolute lack of remorse and an attitude that she would continue to do so despite this prosecution.

## Mitigation

42     When invited to mitigate, the respondent continued to maintain that it was obvious there was dirt from the photographs. It was not as if she had not gone through other measures through the managing agency, the MCST, the security to avoid confrontation with the complainant to resolve the problem.

43     The respondent highlighted that for five years there was no cleaning except for the very first time. She maintained that it was reasonable for her to do the cleaning as nobody would do anything. This had been repeatedly raised in meetings.

## Sentence

44     In my consideration of the appropriate sentence, I agreed with Mr Luke Lee although only three charges had been framed, the respondent had committed multitudinous acts in 2019 and 2020 and each act was likely to cause harassment and distress to the complainant. This was clearly not an instance of a one-off abusive behaviour by the respondent.

45     I further considered the fact that the respondent persisted in her course of conduct in the second and third charges despite the circuit breaker measures when she ought to be aware that the complainant and her family were either working from home or had home based schooling. The complainant and her family had no choice but to suffer the harassment and distress caused by the respondent’s abusive behaviour.

46     I further agreed that the respondent remained defiant despite her conviction on all three charges and continued to maintain that she was justified in her course of conduct. She clearly refuses to take cognisance of her unreasonable conduct and refuses to accept responsibility for her abusive behaviour.

47     Based on the above factors, I agreed with Mr Lee that a high fine should be imposed. In my view, the fine imposed should be beyond the midway point of the sentencing range in view of her egregious conduct. As the respondent had elected to claim trial to these charges, she was not entitled to any sentencing discount. In my view, such a sentence was warranted as both a specific deterrence to the respondent as well as general deterrence to other like-minded offenders. Accordingly, after considering the facts of the present case, the aggravating factors as well as the fact that she was a first offender, I imposed a fine of $3,500 for each charge in default ten days’ imprisonment. The global fine imposed was $10,500 in default 30 days’ imprisonment.
