Criminal Procedure and sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9036/2021/01 .\]

23 March 2021

### District Judge Jill Tan Li Ching:

## Introduction

1       The accused faced 23 charges under s 6(b) read with s 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”), for engaging in a conspiracy to corruptly give agents cash rewards for doing acts in relation to their principals’ affairs. On the first day fixed for his trial, he pleaded guilty to eight of those charges, and consented for the remaining 15 to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He was sentenced to pay a total fine of $34,600, in default 173 days’ imprisonment. These are the grounds for my decision.

## Facts

2       The charges that the accused pleaded guilty to (“the proceeded charges”) were the 10th, 12th, 14th, as well as the 16th to the 20th charges that he faced. The Statement of Facts that he pleaded guilty to is summarised below.

### Background

3       The charges arose in the context of the accused being the general manager of T3 Express Pte Ltd (“T3”), a company which provided freight forwarding and customs clearance services. The accused joined T3 in 2011, and was in charge of sales and client liaison. He reported to Ms Wong Chau Lui (“Ms Wong”), who was the director of T3 and held 80% of its shares. She oversaw all aspects of T3’s operations, but grew to trust the accused and eventually gave him 10% of T3’s shares. She also made him a director in September 2014. Sometime after joining T3, the accused suggested to Ms Wong that they pay “rebates” or “commissions” to clients for successful deals. The intention was to pay corrupt gratification to employees or agents of T3’s clients for advancing T3’s business interests. Ms Wong agreed.

4       The other key persons involved in the proceeded charges were:

> (a)     Solatorio Jesse Clarion (“Mr Solatorio”), the finance manager in T3 at the relevant time who reported to Ms Wong;

> (b)     Poh Tien Chin Raymond (“Mr Poh”), an administrative executive with a company named Asian Eternal Shipping Pte Ltd (“Asian Eternal”) who managed its accounts, purchases and liaison with freight forwarding agents for the transportation of ship spare parts to Indonesia, where its parent company was; Mr Poh reported to Asian Eternal’s director Hendi Effendi (“Mr Effendi”);

> (c)     Ganda Tua Sihombing (“Mr Ganda”), a director of a company named Pt Tirta Anugera Sukses (“PT TAS”), who was responsible for purchasing wines and liquors in Singapore, then engaging freight forwarding companies to deliver these to Indonesia.

The accused’s co-conspirators named in the proceeded charges were Ms Wong and Mr Solatorio.

### Facts Concerning the 10th, 12th and 14th Charges – Asian Eternal

5       Sometime in 2012, Ms Wong met with Mr Poh and Mr Effendi to discuss engaging T3 for Asian Eternal’s shipping needs. Mr Effendi agreed to engage T3, and authorised Mr Poh to engage T3’s services. Sometime in 2013, Ms Wong offered Mr Poh “rebates” as a reward for engaging T3’s freight forwarding and customs clearing services for Asian Eternal. Mr Poh agreed to receive this corrupt gratification. It was also agreed that he would decide the amount of the “rebates”.

6       Ms Wong then tasked the accused to handle the operational matters with Asian Eternal and the handing over of the “rebates” to Mr Poh. Mr Solatorio was tasked to liaise with Mr Poh for the calculation and preparation of payment vouchers for the monies to be handed to Mr Poh. Pursuant to their conspiracy to corruptly give Mr Poh the “rebates” as gratification as a reward for advancing T3’s business interests with Asian Eternal, the following was done:

> (a)      10th charge (DAC 921826/2019): On 28 February 2014, Asian Eternal engaged T3 for sea freight and customs clearance of spare parts from Singapore to Jakarta. After T3 had billed Asian Eternal for the services provided, Mr Poh informed Mr Solatorio that he wanted $2,125 as his “rebate”. Mr Solatorio informed Ms Wong about this request, and she approved it. Mr Solatario then prepared a cheque which Ms Wong signed and handed to the accused. On 3 July 2014, the accused encashed the cheque and handed $2,125 to Mr Poh as his gratification.

> (b)      12th charge (DAC 921828/2019): On 30 April and 30 May 2015, over two invoices, Asian Eternal engaged T3 for sea freight and customs clearance of goods from Singapore to Jakarta. After T3 billed Asian Eternal for the said services, Mr Poh informed Mr Solatorio that he wanted $823 as his “rebate”. After Ms Wong approved this request, Mr Solatorio prepared a cheque which he and the accused signed as Ms Wong was unavailable. The accused encashed the cheque on 19 September 2015, then passed $823 to Mr Poh as his gratification.

> (c)      14th charge (DAC 921830/2019): Between 27 July and 20 October 2016, Asian Eternal engaged T3 for air and sea freight and customs clearance of goods from Singapore to Jakarta. After T3 billed Asian Eternal for the services, Mr Poh informed Mr Solatorio that he wanted $2,090 as his “rebate”. After Ms Wong approved this request, Mr Solatorio prepared a cheque, which he and the accused signed as Ms Wong was unavailable. The accused encashed the cheque on 15 December 2016 and passed $2,090 to Mr Poh as his gratification.

7       The total gratification that Mr Poh received from July 2014 to May 2017, over six occasions (including the charges that were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing), amounted to $6,488.

### Facts Concerning the 16th to 20th Charges – PT TAS

8       Ms Wong and Mr Ganda had been acquainted since 2008. They commenced a business relationship in 2013 after Mr Ganda told Ms Wong about PT TAS’s challenges with its shipping vendor regarding the declaration of alcoholic drinks with Singapore Customs. Ms Wong informed Mr Ganda that she could assist him, and thereafter facilitated PT TAS’s shipping of the alcohol. Subsequently, Mr Ganda informed Ms Wong that he wanted monies in return for PT TAS using T3’s freight forwarding and customs clearance services. He told Ms Wong to effect this by marking up T3’s prices on their services rendered. Ms Wong agreed to this, and that she would determine the mark-up or “commission” to be given to Mr Ganda.

9       Ms Wong informed the accused of this arrangement, and he agreed to it as it meant more income for T3. Mr Solatorio was also kept informed so that he could prepare the cheques and payment vouchers as necessary. Pursuant to their conspiracy to corruptly give Mr Ganda “commissions” as gratification or reward for having PT TAS engage T3 for sea freight and customs clearance of wines and liquors (“Services”), the following was done:

> (a)      16th charge (DAC 921832/2019): In March 2013, after PT TAS engaged T3 for its Services, Ms Wong decided to give Mr Ganda a “commission” of $4,000 as his gratification. She instructed Mr Solatorio to prepare a cheque for that amount, which she signed. After depositing the cheque, Ms Wong withdrew the money. She and the accused then met Mr Ganda and handed him $4,000 in cash on 18 April 2013. The accused was aware of the purpose of this payment.

> (b)      17th charge (DAC 921833/2019): After PT TAS engaged T3 for its Services in March 2014, Ms Wong decided to give Mr Ganda a “commission” of $2,000 as his gratification. She instructed Mr Solatorio to prepare a cheque for that amount, which she signed. On 20 May 2014, Ms Wong encashed the cheque, after which she and the accused met Mr Ganda to hand him $2,000 in cash. The accused was aware of the purpose of this payment.

> (c)      18th charge (DAC 921834/2019): After PT TAS engaged T3 for its Services in July 2015, Ms Wong decided to give Mr Ganda a “commission” of $2,000 as his gratification. She instructed Mr Solatorio to prepare a cash cheque for that amount, which she signed. On 2 September 2015, Ms Wong and the accused met Mr Ganda to hand him the cash cheque. The accused was aware of the purpose of this payment.

> (d)      19th charge (DAC 921834/2019): In February 2016, PT TAS engaged T3 for its Services over two invoices. Ms Wong decided thereafter to give Mr Ganda a “commission” of $900 for each invoice as his gratification. She instructed Mr Solatorio to prepare two cash cheques for $900 each, which she signed. On 11 May 2016, Ms Wong and the accused met Mr Ganda and handed him two cash cheques totalling $1,800, which Mr Ganda subsequently encashed. The accused was aware of the purpose of these payments.

> (e)      20th charge (DAC 921835/2019): In April and June 2016, PT TAS engaged T3 for its Services over three invoices. Ms Wong decided thereafter to give Mr Ganda a total “commission” of $1,800 for these invoices as his gratification. She instructed Mr Solatorio to prepare a cash cheque for that amount, which she signed. On 9 September 2016, Ms Wong met Mr Ganda and handed him the cash cheque for $1,800, which Mr Ganda subsequently encashed. The accused was aware of the purpose of the payment.

10     Between April 2013 and September 2017, Mr Ganda received gratifications on at least nine occasions totalling $13,700 (including the charges that were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing).

11     The accused thus participated in conspiracies to pay or offer corrupt gratification to various agents between 2013 and 2017, pursuant to which a total of $21,866.55 was paid or offered.

## Sentencing

12     Under s 6(b) read with s 29(a) of the PCA, the accused was liable to be punished with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both. He had no previous convictions.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

13     The prosecution made six general points in sentencing. The **first**, as to **whether a custodial sentence was warranted** in this case, was based on the case of _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (“_Romel_”), in which the High Court noted at \[26\] three “broad and non-exhaustive categories” of cases in which private sector corruption could occur. In that case, Menon CJ noted that the three categories of cases were as follows:

> “(a)  First, where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest.”

> (b)    Second, where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This also is typically done at the payer’s behest.

> (c)    Third, where a receiving party is paid so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. This is typically done at the _receiving party’s_ behest.”

14     The High Court went on to note at \[27\] – \[30\] that for cases in the first category (“_Romel_ category 1”), whether the custodial threshold is crossed will depend on the facts. Offences in the second category would frequently attract custodial sentences, while offenders falling under the third category could “generally expect a custodial sentence.”

15     The prosecution’s submission was that the present case fell within _Romel_ category 1, and that although the **custodial threshold was not crossed**, a sufficiently high fine was necessary to meet the needs of deterrence. The prosecution did not rely on the recent High Court case of _Takaaki Masui v PP and another appeal and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 265</span> (“_Masui_”), for reasons that will be set out at the end of these grounds of decision.

16     The prosecution’s **second** point concerned the **accused’s role** in the offences: that not only did he hold considerable authority in T3 as its general manager and shareholder, he also suggested the corrupt scheme to Ms Wong and was thus **instrumental to its initiation**.

17     The **third** point noted the **substantial period** over which the offences occurred and went undetected – from 2013 to 2017. In this regard, the prosecuted cited the High Court in _PP v Fernando Payadala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[43\], that:

>     “The longer the period of time over which the offences have been committed, the more irrefutable it is that the offender manifests the qualities of a habitual offender. Specific deterrence is incontrovertibly an important sentencing consideration in such cases.”

18     The **fourth** point raised by the prosecution was that due to the multiple offences the accused had been charged with, he **should not be treated as a first-time offender** – _Chen Weixiong Jerrick v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[15\], as followed in _Romel’s case_ at \[46\] – \[47\].

19      **Fifth**, the prosecution noted that the accused had consented to multiple similar charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Based on _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 439</span> at \[17\], it was submitted that **these charges should be given due weight to enhance the sentence** that would otherwise be awarded. Reliance was also placed on the Court of Appeal’s holding in _PP v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span>, that such an increase in the sentence would be “commonsensical” as the offender, by agreeing to have the offences taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, “has in substance admitted that he committed those offences.”

20      **Sixth**, the prosecution submitted that the global sentence which they sought, a total fine of at least $35,000, accorded with the principles of **proportionality and parity**, as Ms Wong received a total fine of $35,000 for similar charges. In this regard, the prosecution’s position was that although Ms Wong accepted the accused’s suggestion to engage in this scheme of paying “rebates” and “commissions” to agents of T3’s customers, he was at least as culpable as her, given his position in the company. It was also pointed out that Ms Wong had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, while the accused waited until the first day of his trial, after considerable resources had already been expended. The prosecution’s position was that the accused’s late plea of guilt reflected a lack of genuine remorse and should be given limited weight.

21     The prosecution’s submission on the minimum fines to be imposed on the charges were as set out below. The figures listed in the right-most column were the fines imposed on Ms Wong for her corresponding charges.

### Mitigation & Defence’s Reply to Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

22     In mitigation, the defence asked the court to note that the accused was a first offender who had saved the trial court “valuable time and expenses as well as demonstrating sincere remorse.” The defence also **sought to distinguish the accused’s role from Ms Wong’s** by pointing out that since she was the one who informed the accused and Mr Solatorio of Mr Ganda’s request for the money, hers was the primary role.

23     The defence also submitted that as the accused had disclosed all the transactions to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, he was the equivalent of the informer mentioned in s 40A(1) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”). The defence thus contended that it was “surprising” that the accused had been prosecuted, and that this endangered his safety. In this regard, the defence submitted that the accused’s instrumentality in initiating the schemes, the period of the offences and the number of offences taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing were **“neutralised” by the fact that he was the informant who had put his safety at risk**.

24     Concerning the prosecution’s submission that the accused was facing many charges and thus should not be treated as a first offender, the defence maintained that the **accused’s slate remained clean as long as no previous convictions were shown**. As for the prosecution’s request for parity of treatment with Ms Wong in sentencing, the defence submitted that this was “easily defeated” by the fact that the accused was the informer and without him, the offences might never have come to light. The defence also contended that since the accused had nothing to gain from the transactions and Ms Wong “played the dominant role” when it came to paying the gratification, a minimal fine would suffice for him instead of a hefty one.

### Prosecution’s Reply to Defence’s Position on Sentence

25     On the basis that the accused did not object to this being revealed, the prosecution confirmed that he was the informant in the present case, but pointed out that the statutory provision cited by the defence concerned duties of disclosure under the CDSA, which were completely separate from the PCA. The prosecution also disagreed that being an informer reduced the accused’s culpability or earned him a discount in sentencing.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Sentencing precedents

26     Only the prosecution presented sentencing precedents to the court. The following are those which I regarded as being more relevant to this case. (The first three precedents listed concern offenders involved in the same offences as the accused; no others in this scheme have been dealt with at this time.)

> (a)      _PP v Wong Chau Lui_ (DAC 921745/2019 and 24 others)

> Ms Wong’s role in the offences was stated above. She pleaded guilty in November 2019 to eight charges and consented to 17 being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Her eight charges concerned the **same transactions as in the accused’s eight proceeded charges**. Ms Wong was sentenced to a **total fine of $35,000**, with the breakdown as set out in the last column in the table at paragraph 21 above. She, like the accused, was untraced. The **total amount of bribes** involved in the charges that she faced was **$22,116.55**.

> (b)      _PP v Lim Ying Chao_ (DAC 921645/2019 and 10 others)

> Mr Lim was a co-conspirator named in the 1st to 9th charges faced by the accused, along with Ms Wong and Mr Solatorio. He was an operations officer of a company named Covenant Freight Pte Ltd, which was a sister company of T3 and provided similar services. Ms Wong instructed Mr Lim to offer gratification to agents of Covenant’s customers, and decide upon the amount. Mr Lim was entrusted with the monies and would hand them to the recipients, but also misappropriated some of these monies for himself. The **total amount involved in the bribes was $2,228.55**, while the total amount misappropriated was $500. He faced 11 charges in all, and pleaded guilty to three in August 2019, with the remaining eight being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He was untraced.

> Two of the charges he pleaded guilty to were under s 6(b) read with s 29(a) of the PCA, for **giving gratification of $300 and offering gratification of $328.55 respectively**. He received a **fine of $1,000 for each** of these offences. The third charge was under s 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), for misappropriating $400 out of $500 which had been entrusted to him to pay to recipients as gratification. He was sentenced to a fine of $400 for this offence.

> (c)      _PP v Ganda Tua Sihombing_ (DAC 921719/2019 and 9 others)

> As noted above, Mr Ganda was a recipient of the gratification in the series of offences involving PT TAS. He pleaded guilty in September 2019 to three charges and consented to seven being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The **total amount of bribes involved in his charges was $13,700**.

> The three charges that he pleaded guilty to concerned his corrupt receipt of amounts of **$4,000, $2,000 and $2,000 as gratification** respectively. He was sentenced to pay a **fine of $10,000 on the first charge, and a fine of $5,000 each on the other two charges**. He was untraced.

> (d)      _Thor Chi Tiong v PP_ (MA 9123/2016)

> The offender, financer of a company named Infinity Pte Ltd (“Infinity”), **corruptly gave $10,000** to the facility manager of a company named Micron Semiconductor Asia Pte Ltd (“Micron”) as a reward for assisting Infinity to secure a sub-contract from Micron. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was initially sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment, but this was reduced on appeal to a **fine of $35,000**. He was untraced.

> (e)      _Heng Tze Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 976</span>

> This offender was the director of a company that also paid **bribes totalling $10,000** to the same facility manager of Micron (the company named in the above case precedent) to secure contracts from Micron. He pleaded guilty to one **charge involving a bribe of $7,000**, and consented to one other charge being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. His initial sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment was reduced to a **fine of $35,000** upon appeal. He was untraced.

> (f)      _PP v Kim Hungsun_ (DAC 908867/2016 and 3 others)

> This offender was a director and majority shareholder of a company that paid **bribes totalling $7,400** to an equipment engineer (“receiver”) from another company, as inducement for the receiver to further the offender’s company’s business with the receiver’s employer. As a result, the receiver gave his employer positive feedback on the offender’s company. The offender pleaded guilty to two charges, involving **bribes of $4,000 and $1,500 respectively**. Two other charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender was untraced, and was sentenced to **fines of $8,000 and $4,000** on the charges respectively. His **total fine was thus $12,000**.

> (g)      _PP v Foo Say Keong Alex_ (DAC 939804/2017 and 14 others)

> This matter involved a school which had two companies providing it with transport services, one of which was the offender’s company. When the school was about to terminate the services of the other company, the school’s transport manager told the offender that there would be an open tender for a new transport provider, and gave the offender suggestions as to how he could secure that contract, including the price at which he should tender for the transport services. After the offender won the open tender, the transport manager asked for bribes for himself and the transport executive (his girlfriend) as a reward for awarding the contract to the offender’s company. The offender eventually paid **bribes amounting to $25,100**, and was charged with 15 counts under the PCA. He pleaded guilty to two charges, involving **bribes of $2,500 and $4,000 respectively**. The remaining 13 charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He was untraced, but was sentenced to **fines of $7,000 and $8,000 respectively** for the charges.

27     These cases concerned private sector corruption, in which bribes were given to agents as rewards in assisting or furthering the givers’ business interests, in which no real detriment was caused to the principals – that is, cases falling within _Romel_ category 1. The offenders were also untraced. Certain patterns emerged when the fines imposed in these precedents were examined and compared to the bribe amounts involved:

> (a)     In general, the offenders’ fines in individual charges were in the region of two to three-and-a-half times the amounts involved in the bribes.

> (b)     The total fine amounts tended to exceed the total amounts involved in the bribes, by up to three-and-a-half times. This was the case even in the case of _Thor Chi Tiong v PP_, in which the offender faced a single charge. One notable exception to this rule for the giver of bribes was the accused in _PP v Foo Say Keong Alex_, who received a total fine of $15,000 when the total bribe amount involved in all his charges was $25,100. However, this case could be distinguished on the basis that the offender did not initiate the bribes.

28     Bearing the precedents and sentencing ranges in mind, I turned to further considerations that might cause the sentences to be reduced or enhanced.

#### Sentencing considerations

##### (1)   Imprisonment or fine

29     To begin with, I agreed with the prosecution that this case fell within _Romel_ category 1. In paragraph \[20\] therein, the High Court noted that:

>     “Where private sector agents are concerned, offences which register a lower level of culpability can be dealt with by the imposition of fines. Such cases are generally those where the amount of gratification is below $30,000 and where there is no real detriment to the interests of the principal.”

At the same time, the High Court stated that this did not create any presumption that non-custodial sentences would be imposed whenever private sector corruption was concerned.

30     In the present case, the total amount of gratification involved was below $30,000, and all parties involved were in the private sector. While Mr Ganda told Ms Wong to mark-up T3’s prices to PT TAS to allow his “commissions” to be paid, which act would have caused PT TAS to pay higher prices than they might otherwise need to, the Statement of Facts did not specify whether this was eventually done. Ultimately, it did not appear that the bribes caused any real detriment to the interests of the principals concerned, and I did not find any reason to conclude that this case crossed the custodial threshold. I therefore proceeded on the basis that fines should be imposed on the accused.

##### (2)   Leniency for informer?

31     I then considered the defence’s contention that as an informer, the accused should be treated more leniently. On this point, I found that the defence’s reliance on the provisions of the CDSA was misplaced. The informer referred to in s 40A of the CDSA is one who makes a report to the Suspicious Transactions Reporting Office under s 3A(3) or s 39(1) of the CDRA – see s 40A(4) of the CDSA. S 39(1) of the CDSA creates an obligation on certain persons to disclose their knowledge or suspicion that property represents the proceeds of, or was used/was intended to be used in connection with any act which may constitute, drug dealing or criminal conduct. It is _in the context of this obligation of disclosure_ that these _informers are given certain protections_ under s 40 of the CDSA _in relation to offences under the CDSA_. S 40A(1) of the CDSA also states that the information disclosed by informers shall not be admitted in criminal proceedings, and no witness in criminal proceedings shall be obliged to disclose the name and address of any informer or answer questions that would tend to lead to the discovery of that information.

32     S 36(1) of the PCA grants protection to informers in similar terms to that in s 40A(1) of the CDSA – that no witness shall be compelled, obliged or permitted to disclose the name or address of any informer, or state any matter which might lead to his discovery. However, the PCA provision is not in the context of any obligation of disclosure. More importantly, there was no issue of any witness in the present case being compelled to disclose the name and address of the accused. _Indeed, nothing in the documents submitted by the prosecution suggested that he was the informer; it was the defence who revealed this._ There was thus nothing in these sections that the accused could rely on to protect him in this instance. Crucially, s 40A(1) of the CDSA and s 36(1) of the PCA do not prohibit the prosecution of an informant for an offence under s 6(b) of the PCA. They also do not require or suggest that he be given lenient treatment in sentencing due to his status as an informer.

33     In this regard, the defence did not raise any accepted principle of sentencing that required an informer to be sentenced leniently. If any such leniency was granted, it would surely be fact-based, being a function of factors such as his reason for informing on his co-conspirators, his co-operation with authorities, and signs of his remorse such as an early plea of guilt.

34     As the prosecution did not grant any concession on account of the accused having been an informer, I had no grounds on which to conclude that the information he provided was especially helpful to the authorities, that the co-operation he gave was unstinting, or that none of this would have come to light but for the accused. The defence made a bare allegation that the accused had endangered his own safety by being an informer, but without evidence as to why, such as whether his co-conspirators were in a position to cause harm or hurt to him. As for his remorse, contrary to the defence’s submission, the mere fact that the accused was an informer did not automatically mean that he was remorseful. While he did plead guilty to the offences, this came only on the first day of trial, which was very late compared to his co-conspirators or even Mr Ganda, all of whom pleaded guilty in 2019. I was therefore unable to conclude that the accused’s level of remorse was high.

35     Thus, the mere fact that the accused was an informer was insufficient reason to grant him much more leniency than Ms Wong or the other accused persons.

##### (3)   Aggravating factors

36     I then considered whether there were aggravating factors, and agreed with the prosecution that there were.

> (a)     First, the accused initiated the scheme by suggesting it to Ms Wong. Contrary to the defence’s submission, he stood to benefit from it as he was a shareholder in T3, so it was in his financial interests for the company to secure contracts and do well.

> (b)     Second, there _were_ multiple offences which took place over some four years, which was a substantial period. I therefore agreed with the prosecution that a sufficiently heavy fine needed to be imposed to deter the accused from repeating such offences. It is also clear that when an accused person is faced with multiple offences the first time he appears in court, the courts have often given little weight to the fact that he is untraced. Thus, despite the defence’s assertion to the contrary, it was difficult to give much weight to the accused’s “clean slate”.

> (c)     Third, concerning the charges that had been taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, it remained within this court’s discretion whether to enhance the sentence on this account.

37     I was unable to agree with the defence’s submission that the fact that the accused was an informer “neutralised” the aggravating factors such as the number of offences and the length of the period over which they occurred. Given that there was no indication of the reasons that led to him being an informer, it was also difficult to say that negated the aggravating weight of the fact that he was the initiator of the scheme. I therefor saw no reason to discount the weight of the aggravating factors referred to in paragraph 36.

38     As for whether the accused’s role in the offences could be meaningfully distinguished from Ms Wong’s, I noted that Ms Wong _was_ primarily responsible for giving instructions to Mr Solatorio on preparing the payments and cheques for the gratification. However, the accused was certainly not standing idly by:

> (a)     In two of the proceeded charges involving Asian Eternal, he jointly signed the cheques for payment to Mr Poh;

> (b)     In all three of the proceeded charges involving Asian Eternal, he assisted to complete the offences by encashing the cheques, then handing the cash to Mr Poh;

> (c)     In four out of the five proceeded charges involving PT TAS, he accompanied Ms Wong to hand the cheques or cash to Mr Ganda, thus playing a key role in completing those offences as well.

39     The only offence in which I could find that the accused’s culpability was appreciably less than Ms Wong’s was in the 20th charge, as he played no active role in executing that offence; he was merely aware that the gratification was being paid and acquiesced to it. I thus took the view that his sentence should be lower than Ms Wong’s for that offence.

#### Decision

40     In summary, I was unable conclude that the accused’s culpability in the offences was appreciably less than Ms Wong’s, except in the 20th charge. I also noted that Ms Wong pleaded guilty earlier than the accused, and thus saved more resources than he did, since the prosecution was already prepared to begin his trial when he decided to plead guilty. Based on the sentencing precedents, I was of the view that the sentences imposed on Ms Wong were appropriate. Bearing in mind the need for parity in sentencing as between co-accused persons, I sentenced the accused as follows:

#### Final observation

41     As noted above, the prosecution did not rely on the case of _Masui_ in their sentencing submissions on the ground that the decision post-dated the sentencing of the accused’s co-conspirators – in particular, Ms Wong. Nevertheless, the prosecution informed the court that they had applied the sentencing framework therein as a check, and were satisfied that the sentence recommendation remained appropriate.

42     In _Masui_, Chan Seng Onn J agreed with the broad categorisations in _Romel_ for private sector corruption, but proposed a modified sentencing framework (“Modified Framework”) based on the harm-culpability matrix adopted in _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span>. I applied this Modified Framework (set out at \[236\] to \[286\] of _Masui_) to test the viability of the above sentencing outcome, and the results were as follows:

> (a)      Step 1 required the court to identify offence-specific factors that went towards the harm caused and the culpability of the accused person. As noted above, there was limited harm caused to the principals in question, and the amount of gratification given was well within the $30,000 threshold below which the courts ordinarily imposed a fine. In terms of culpability, the offences were premeditated and lasted for an extended period. However, the offences were not especially sophisticated, and there were no threats or coercion involved. Overall, my view was that the _harm caused was slight, while the level of culpability was low_.

> (b)      Steps 2 and 3 required the court to derive an indicative starting sentence. In this regard, Chan J introduced a Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix, which he translated into a simplified form called the Contour Matrix. The refinements made to sentencing guidance as a result of these matrices largely affected cases that fell within the higher ranges of the harm-culpability axes, that is, where harm was moderate to severe (and beyond, to infinity), and where culpability was medium to high (and beyond, to infinity). _As my findings were that harm was slight and culpability low, the starting sentence remained non-custodial. Based on the sentencing precedents, my view was that the fines should in general start at about two times the amount of the bribes._

> (c)      Steps 4 and 5 required the court to consider the offender-specific factors that did not directly relate to the commission of the offence, and the totality principle. Aggravating factors included offences taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, while mitigating factors included a guilty plea. As noted above, I found that the number of charges taken into consideration for the accused’s sentencing should be factored in increasing his overall sentence, while his late guilty plea had limited mitigating weight. Based on the sentencing precedents, my finding was that the sentences imposed on Ms Wong were appropriate. Balancing Ms Wong’s slightly higher level of culpability with her earlier guilty plea against the accused’s culpability and late guilty plea, I found that their overall sentences should not be substantially different. The total fine to be imposed was also proportionate considering the total amount of bribes and number of offences involved, and could not be said to be crushing.

43     I therefore agreed with the prosecution that even under the _Masui_ Modified Framework, the sentencing result would not have been different.

## Conclusion

44     In conclusion, for the reasons set out above, the accused was sentenced to a total fine of $36,400, in default 173 days’ imprisonment. He paid $5,000 on 10 February 2021, and was allowed to pay the balance in five further monthly instalments of $5,000 each on the 10th day of the subsequent months, with a final instalment of $4,600 payable on 10 August 2021. He appealed against the sentence imposed, but had paid the March 2021 instalment as at the time of writing.
