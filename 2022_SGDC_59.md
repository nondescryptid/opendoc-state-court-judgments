Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Mandatory minimum sentence – Central Provident Fund Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9047/2022/01.\]

23 March 2022

### District Judge A Sangeetha:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Region Periodicals Distributor Pte Ltd, pleaded guilty to nine charges under the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36, Rev Ed 2013) (“the Act”) for its failure to pay contributions to the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”), within the prescribed statutory period, in respect of three employees for a period of three months from April to June 2021. The Accused was represented by its director, one Mr Yew Fook Cheong Dickson (“Mr Yew”).

2       As the Accused was a repeat offender, the Accused was liable to be punished with a mandatory minimum fine of not less than $2,000 under s 61(2)(_d_) of the Act. Having considered the facts of this case and the Accused’s mitigation, I sentenced the Accused to the mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 per charge.

3       In view of the Accused’s circumstances, I allowed the Accused to make payment of the total fine of $18,000 over six monthly instalments with the first instalment of $3,000 being due on 4 March 2022. The Accused failed to make payment on the due date and an Order of Attachment to Levy was issued against the accused on 9 March 2022. On the same day, the Accused through its representative filed this appeal against sentence. To-date, the Accused has failed to pay the fine of $18,000 or part thereof.

4       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## The charges

6       As the charges were similarly worded, differing only in the period of offending and the name of the employee, for reference, I have reproduced L09614\_2021-1:

> You, Region Periodicals Distributor Pte Ltd, are charged that you on or about 17 May 2021, did fail to pay contributions to the Central Provident Fund for the month of April 2021 in respect of your employee, Norhisham Bin Hassan, as required by Section 7(1) of the Central Provident Fund Act (Chapter 36) within the period prescribed by Regulation 2(1) of the Central Provident Fund Regulations and thereby committed an offence under Section 58(1)(b) of the Central Provident Fund Act (Chapter 36) and punishable under Section 61 of the said Act.

## Background

7       Before I go into the background of the present case, it is apposite to briefly set out the regulatory offences framework prosecuted by the CPF Board in the State Courts. These cases are usually first mentioned in Court 4A(N) of the State Courts (“Court 4A(N)”), a night court. Defendants either elect to claim trial or seek several adjournments to compound the matters, raise funds or engage in discussions with the CPF Board. Cases which are not resolved at Court 4A(N) will be fixed for mention in Court 7A of the State Courts (“Court 7A”). In Court 7A, defendants may seek further adjournments and where reasonable, such requests are granted with directions from the court. Once payment of the arrears including interest and composition are made, the CPF Board will apply for a discharge amounting to an acquittal. There remains a group of defendants who fail to make payments – some are unwilling while others may not have the means to do so. For this group, further requests for adjournments are rejected and their pleas will be taken.

8       In the present case, the Accused’s case was first heard in Court 7A on 22 December 2021 after being mentioned in night court. At that hearing, on the request of the Accused, I granted a four-week adjournment for the Accused to pay at least $2,400 towards the outstanding CPF arrears. Despite this, the Accused returned for the next mention on 19 January 2022 without making any payment. A further adjournment was sought and one week was granted for the Accused to make payment of the initial sum of $2,400.

9       On 25 January 2022, again, the Accused failed to make payment. The court was informed that the company was expecting incoming funds of $3,700 and would make payment of the said $2,400 the next day. The case was adjourned to 27 January 2022 for the Accused to make payment of $2,400.

10     On 27 January 2022, the Accused, despite its earlier representations, only made payment of $1,200 instead of $2,400. Considering that some effort was made by the Accused, the court granted a fourth adjournment and directed the Accused to pay $2,000 (being $1,200 of the initial payment and $800 further payment towards the arrears) by the next mention.

11     On 10 February 2022, at the fifth mention in Court 7A, the Accused reported that it paid $1,250 out of $2,000, leaving a shortfall of about $750. The court was informed that the Accused was expecting a sum of $2,800 at the end of February. I noted that it took the Accused five mentions to make a total payment of $2,450. Given the Accused’s trajectory of non-payment or delayed payments, the court granted a final adjournment for the Accused to pay $1,205 by the next mention, failing which the Accused’s plea will be taken.

12     On 24 February 2022, the Accused informed the court that it had paid $918 as Mr Yew would normally pay CPF on a monthly basis and that this system was easier for Mr Yew to keep track of payments. As the Accused failed make payment as directed by the Court, the Accused’s application for further adjournment was rejected and plea was taken. The Accused pleaded guilty without qualification and understood the nature and consequences of the plea.

## Prescribed Penalty

13     The prescribed penalty for an offence of non-payment of CPF under s 58(1)(_b)_ of the Act is a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 and, in the case of a subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000: see s 61(2)(_d_) of the Act.

## Antecedents

14     The Accused had multiple similar convictions on 5 October 2010, 21 March 2012, 29 March 2013, 16 April 2014 and 25 November 2021. Under s 61(3) of the Act, the Accused was a repeat offender.

15     For the conviction on 16 April 2014, the Accused was sentenced to a fine of $1,400 per charge. For the conviction on 25 November 2021, the Accused was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 per charge.

## Submissions on sentence

16     As the Accused was a repeat offender, the Prosecution sought the mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 per charge.

17     In mitigation, Mr Yew apologised for not making payments as directed by the Court and sought more time to do so. He explained that the Accused would be able to complete payment of arrears in the next three and a half months. Mr Yew’s request for more time to make payment was rejected.

## Sentence

18     The CPF is a mandatory social security savings scheme for Singaporeans and permanent residents. All employers and employees are required under the law to contribute a portion of the employee’s monthly gross salary to the CPF. The CPF is used to fund basic needs such as home ownership, healthcare and retirement needs.

19     Parliament and the CPF Board take a serious view of employers who do not pay CPF contributions for their employees. I refer to the words of the then Acting Minister of Manpower, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin:

> Some employers do not comply with the CPF Act because they are ignorant or have a wrong understanding of CPF Act obligations. For instance, some employers have the misconception that CPF is not payable for part-time and casual employees. But there are other employers who wilfully flout the law to reduce business costs.

> No matter what the reason is, we treat non-compliance with the CPF Act seriously. Singaporeans save for their retirement through the CPF. The CPF also helps them pay for housing and healthcare expenses. In addition, the CPF is a key conduit through which the Government channels financial assistance to the more economically vulnerable Singaporeans. If a low-income worker is outside the CPF net, he will lose out on receiving Workfare Income Supplement, and occasional top-ups that the Government contributes to his CPF account.

(see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (14 November 2012) vol 73 (Written Answers to Questions for Oral Answer Not Answered by 1.30pm — Breach of CPF Employers’ Contribution Rules))

20     With Parliament’s intent in mind, I noted that the Accused was granted multiple adjournments and failed to make payments as per its own representations or the court’s directions. Having considered the history of the case and the Accused’s financial circumstances, I was of the view that a minimum mandatory fine of $2,000 per charge was appropriate and no uplift was necessary.

21     As mentioned earlier, having considered the Accused’s means, I granted a six-month instalment plan commencing in March 2022 for the Accused to pay the court fines. The Accused failed to make payment of the first instalment and an order of attachment to levy a fine was issued.

22     Further, pursuant to s 61B of the Act, I ordered that the arrears of CPF contributions and interest amounting to $5,594 be paid by the Accused to the CPF Board forthwith.

## Conclusion

23     I imposed the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by s 61(2)(_d_) of the Act. In view of the facts of this case, the mandatory minimum sentence was the appropriate sentence and cannot be said to be manifestly excessive.
