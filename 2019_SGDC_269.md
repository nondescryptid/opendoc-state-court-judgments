\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9312/2019/01.\]

9 December 2019

### District Judge Toh Han Li:

1       This is an appeal by the accused against sentence.

## The charge

2       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> _DAC-929161-2019_

> You are charged that you, in May 2018, at 34 Toh Guan Road East #01-19 Enterprise Hub, Singapore, did make five false documents, _to wit_, five false monthly statements for CIMB bank account number XXX for the period of January 2018 to May 2018, with intent to cause Citibank Singapore Limited to part with property by disbursing a loan of $250,000 to Richz Technology (S) Pte Ltd, which taken together amounts to a course of conduct, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 465 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.), which charge is amalgamated pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.)

## Statement of Facts

3       The accused is Lim Kwei Luan. At the material time of the offence, he was a director of Richz Technology (S) Pte Ltd (“the Company”). The Company provided repair services to vacuum pumps.

4       The complainant is Ong Choon Guan (“Ong”). Citibank Singapore Limited (“Citibank”) employed him as a fraud manager.

5       Huang Yuanzhen (“Huang”) was employed by Citibank as a Team Leader for the Unsecured Business Loan Department. Huang’s department handled loan applications for amounts ranging from $50,000 to $250,000.

6       Khor Jun Kai (“Khor’) was employed by Citibank as a Business Financial Manager for the Unsecured Business Loan Department.

7       In May 2018 at the Company’s registered address, the accused falsified five monthly statements for the Company’s CIMB bank account number XXX for the period of January 2018 to May 2018. He inflated the balance and figures in the statements with the Adobe Acrobat software on a Company laptop. He did so without the knowledge of the other director of the Company. On 16 May 2018, the accused applied for a business loan of $250,000 from Citibank to boost the Company’s cash flow. He submitted the falsified statements and another set of CIMB bank statements to Citibank.

8       On 19 July 2018, Huang and Khor met the accused at the Company’s registered address. The accused and the other director of the Company signed on the loan application form. Huang and Khor left the Company’s premises thereafter.

9       Huang and Khor later discovered several discrepancies in the five CIMB bank statements furnished by the accused. One of the figures in the January 2018 statement appeared distorted. There were two different addresses and balances on two statements for the same month. The alignment of the tables were dissimilar to other typical bank statements. The fonts used were also different. Huang and Khor placed the loan application on hold and reported the matter to their superiors.

10     Ong learnt of this matter later and lodged an electronic police report with Clementi Police Divisional HQ on 26 July 2018. Ong stated that one or more bank statements might have been forged in the Company’s unsecured business loan application and requested for police assistance. On 27 July 2018 at 11.57 a.m., the accused messaged Khor to cancel the loan application under the pretext that the Company received fresh funds from another investor. Citibank did not approve the application and did not disburse any loan.

## Antecedents

11     The accused is a first offender.

## Prosecutions submission on sentence

12     The prosecution submitted that for an offence of forgery under s 465 Penal Code, depending on the intent and amount involved, the sentence may vary from a fine to a substantial prison term.

13     It submitted that:

> a.     A fine is appropriate where the offence was committed to support a claim or title without monetary value and where there was no intent to cause damage or loss, or where the mischief was minor.

> b.     Where there was intent to cause damage or injury or where the mischief was serious, a term of imprisonment appeared to be the norm.

14     While offences involving low amounts are likely to be dealt with by a fine, if the amount is large or where public confidence is at stake, a jail term would be inevitable, and that the ‘entry point’ sentence appears to be six months’ imprisonment; see _Wan Chin Hon v PP_ (MA 516/93).

15     Where the forgery was committed to cause any person to part with property, the governing consideration would be the value of the property; see _Gana Prakasam s/o Thangaveloo v PP_ (MA 224/2000). Similar considerations would predominate where the forgery was to cause a person to enter into a contract; see Krishnasamy Mohana Das v PP (MA 266/97).

16     The Prosecution submits that an appropriate sentence for the present case would be at least 6 weeks’ imprisonment. General deterrence ought to be the primary sentencing objective because such offences are easily to commit but difficult to detect. It is in the public interest for the courts to take a harsh stand against deception of financial institutions. The prevalence of such offences will erode public confidence.

17     The prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors:

> a)     The victim was a financial institution and the fraud perpetuated involved an important financial service provided by banks to businesses. This is an important form of financing which helps businesses with cash flow. Fraud such as this threatens to erode trust in commerce and lead to ever more stringent checks by banks on honest businesses. This would raise the costs to banks of providing such financing and make it costlier and consequently more difficult for businesses to obtain such commercial financing.

> b)     All the documents forged were bank statements which are ordinarily and frequently relied upon as accurately representing the banking transactions or records contained therein. The use of such documents in Singapore’s financial ecosystem is more common than ever, given that more transactions are electronic and fewer are face-to-face. The forgery of such documents threatens the ability to rely on these documents and may lead to increased checks on each and every financial transaction executed.

> c)     The forged bank statements misused the name of another financial institution which bolstered the standing of the forged documents.

> d)     The accused person abused his position of authority as a Company director; the office of directorship imbues its holders with a high degree of trust.

> e)     The accused person’s actions were premediated and deliberate; they involved significant planning and preparation.

18     The prosecution noted that the accused had pleaded guilty and that no loss was caused by the accused’s forgery. While the prosecution did not dispute that he had subsequently withdrawn the loan application before its expected withdrawal, even if it had been done out of a belated guilty conscience, he had lied to Khor that he no longer needed the loan on the false pretext that he had fresh funds from another investor. It was in fact due to the diligence of the Citibank’s fraud prevention officer that they were able to discover the forgeries in time, and Citibank had lodged a police report before the accused cancelled the loan application. No credit should therefore be given to the accused for this mitigating fact.

19     The prosecution also submitted the following sentencing precedents:

20     In _PP v Chin Tze Jien Leonard_ MA 77/2005 _(“Leonard Chin’s case”_), the accused was a consultant of a subsidiary company. Feeling obligated to his bosses at the parent company, he forged a reseller agreement in the sum of $500,000 and also forged the corresponding cheque deposit for 10%. He submitted these forged documents to the parent company, which in turn, went public with the falsely inflated sale figures. The offender cooperated with investigations and pleaded guilty to a charge under s 465 Penal Code with three other charges were taken into consideration. The sentencing judge noted that even though there was no financial gain to the offender, for example in terms of commission, the primary consideration in sentencing was the magnitude of the crime, and the forgery of a document representing such a high value transaction must attract a sentence that would adequately punish and deter similar acts. Given the nature of the document and what it purported to be, the court concluded that a fine alone, even a high one, was not adequate. The accused was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000.

21     In _PP v Renuga Devi d/o Rajagopal_ MA 33/2010 the accused signed an option to purchase a HDB flat. She paid the initial down payment. When the next payment of $30,600 became due, she forged a HDB ‘Payment Advice’ purporting to show her payment of the said sum. This document was handed over to the HDB as proof of payment to induce the latter to deliver the title deed of the flat. The HDB officer noted discrepancies in the document and raised the alert. This offence was committed while she was under investigations for the cheating case. She explained that she committed the offences as she was in dire financial straits. She was sentenced to 4 months and 5 weeks’ imprisonment and her appeal against sentence was dismissed.

22     In _PP v Mazlan Bin Duaji_ SC-900455-2014 (“_Mazlan Bin Duaji’s_ case) the accused abetted a relationship manager of a bank to issue four forged letters of comfort in favour of the client which was the accused. The letters were issued to various business associates of the accused and stated that he had access to significant amounts of funds (either USD 50 million or USD 150 million). The accused in fact had no money in his bank account, and the bank had not granted him any credit facilities.

23     The accused faced a total of five charges. In respect of the 4th charge where a company had transferred a sum of USD 442,800 in reliance of the letter no restitution was made. In respect of the 2nd charge, the victim had suffered reputational loss and the accused’s action led to the closing down of its Singapore office, including the retrenchment of 12 employees. In respect of the 3rd and 5th charges, there was no evidence of any damage. The accused claimed trial was convicted and sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment on the 2nd charge, 3 months’ imprisonment on the 3rd charge, 2 years and 6 month’s imprisonment on the 4th charge and 3 month’s imprisonment on the 5th charge.

24     In _PP v Teo Eng Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 141</span> MA 82/2005 the accused was employed as a personal banker with UOB. A customer requested for a housing loan of $880,000. UOB only agreed to offer $616,000 to the customer. However, the accused altered the UOB Letter of Offer from $616,000 to $880,000 (a difference of $264,000). He also altered the loan tenure from 10 to 14 years. He then deceived the branch manager to sign the forged document. UOB later discovered the discrepancy, but it presented a genuine Letter of Offer on the same terms as the previous altered letter to avoid offending the customer. The accused claimed that he intended to assist the bank by securing business for it. Teo was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment on the charge involving UOB.

25     In the second charge (‘the HSBC charge”), the accused was employed as a Personal Finance Manager with HSBC. He dishonestly filled in the particulars and appended the signature of one of his customers on a HSBC cash withdrawal form. He intended to use the form to make a withdrawal of $1,000 from his customer’s account at a later date, to pay off his own credit card bills and left the form in his drawer. Later that day, a staff found the forged form in the drawer and reported the matter. Teo was sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment on the HSBC charge.

## Mitigation plea

26     The accused is married with two children age 15 and 17.

27     He has been director for about 13 to 14 years at the Company, whose business is providing service to semiconductor companies. The semiconductor trade in Singapore is a highly competitive industry. From 2018 onwards there was a downturn in the industry, which translated into higher competition for a smaller pie for the Company![]([2019] SGDC 0269_Image/[2019] SGDC 0269_image1.jpg)

28     Despite many years of hard work by the accused, in the first few months of 2018 ![]([2019] SGDC 0269_Image/[2019] SGDC 0269_image2.jpg)during the industry downturn, the Company found itself in need of sufficient working capital. This caused the accused to worry about the survival of the Company, and its ten employees. Deeply worried by thoughts of insolvency, the accused committed the offence, and submitted them to Citibank to apply for a loan of $250,000 badly needed by the Company. The reason for the said loan was titled: “business expansion” as titling the loan such as "financial difficulty" would have made the loan dead in the water. Sufficiently worried by the Company's financial solvency, the Accused chose to stop receiving all salary due to him from January 2018 onwards.

29     However, stricken by a guilty mind, on a date before the loan's expected approval, the Accused notified Citibank that he intended to withdrew the Company's application for the loan. Defence counsel said that he could not state the true reason for the withdrawal of the loan so he had lied to Citibank that he had obtained fresh funds from another investor. As the application was withdrawn by the accused himself, no funds were disbursed, and therefore there was no loss to anyone. The defence submitted that the accused intended to service the loan if approved, without intending to run off with it.

30     The defence accordingly asked the Court to impose a non custodial sentence with a fine at the appropriate level.

## The sentence

31     The punishment prescribed for an offence under s 465 Penal Code is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or a fine, or both.

32     In the _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition)_, the learned authors state at page 980:

> A fine is appropriate where the offence was committed to support a claim or title without monetary value and where there was no intent to cause damage or loss, or where the mischief was minor. **Where there was intent to cause damage or injury or where the mischief was serious, a term of imprisonment appears to be the norm**. The ‘entry point’ sentence appears to be six months’ imprisonment; see _Wan Chin Hon v PP (MA 516/93)_. Where the forgery was committed to cause any person to part with property, the governing consideration would be the value of the property; see _Gana Prakasam s/o Thangaveloo v PP (MA 224/2000)_. Offences involving low amounts are likely to be dealt with by a fine. **However, if the amount is large or where public confidence is at stake, a jail term would be inevitable**. Similar considerations would predominate where the forgery was to cause a person to enter into a contract; see Krishnasamy Mohana Das v PP (MA 266/97) \[emphasis mine\].

33     The key issue in the present case is whether the custodial threshold had been crossed. In this regard, I found the following to be aggravating factors in the present case:

> a)     The accused person’s actions were premediated and deliberate; they involved significant planning and preparation as five bank statements had been forged using the Company’s laptop and software. He had titled the purpose of the loan as “business expansion” as titling the loan such as "financial difficulty" would have made the loan a non starter.

> b)     The forged bank statements were meant to induce Citibank to approve a loan of $250,000 to his Company, which was a high value transaction.

> c)     The accused person had committed the offence in his capacity as a company director which was a position of trust.

> d)     The forgery had been committed against a financial institution who was rendering an important financial service to corporate clients. Such fraudulent acts threaten to erode trust in commerce and would lead to ever more stringent checks by banks on honest businesses. This would raise the compliance costs to banks of providing financing and ultimately translate into increased business costs.

34     For the above reasons, I am of the view that general deterrence ought to be the primary sentencing objective in the present case and the custodial threshold had been crossed.

35     In terms of the accused subsequently applying to withdraw the loan on the basis of “a guilty mind” before the loan's expected approval date, it should be noted that by the time the accused had messaged Khor to cancel the loan application, the forgery had been detected by the Citibank staff and a police report had been made.

36     Further, when the accused messaged Khor to cancel the loan application, he did so on the false pretext that he had obtained alternative sources of funding rather than come clean on the forgery he had perpetrated on Citibank.

37     As such, I consider Citibank‘s detection of the forgery and the cancellation of the loan by the accused as neutral factors.

38     Nonetheless, in calibrating the actual term of imprisonment, I noted that there was no loan disbursed and actual financial loss to Citibank. I also accorded the accused a mitigating discount on account of his plea of guilt.

39     The facts of the present case bear some resemblance to _Teo Eng Hui’s_ case where HSBC bank staff had found the form forged by the accused in the drawer and reported the matter before the accused could use the forged document to withdraw the monies from his customer’s account. Teo was sentenced to 2 week’ imprisonment.

40     In _Mazlan Bin Duaji’s case_, where there was no evidence of loss occasioned by the accused’s forgery with respect to the 3rd and 5th charges, the accused was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment after a trial.

41     In _Leonard Chin’s case_, the sentencing judge noted that even if there was no financial gain to the accused, the forgery of a document that represented a high value document must attract a punishment that would adequately punish and deter similar acts. Chin was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000.

42     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a short jail term of 2 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate.

43     The accused was granted a deferment of sentence and filed an appeal prior to serving sentence. He was granted a stay of execution pending appeal and is currently on bail bond of $20,000.
