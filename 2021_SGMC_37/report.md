INSURANCE – accident insurance

10 June 2021

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       The parties in the present suit were involved in another suit, namely District Court Suit number 387 of 2015 (“DC 387”). The plaintiff in both suits were the same. In DC 387 that was filed on 3 Feb 2015, the plaintiff who was injured in a motor accident that occurred on 22 July 2012 along Bayfront Avenue, sued one Guo Nenqing to recover his personal injuries, loss and damage arising from the accident. AXA Insurance Pte Ltd was the insurer of Guo Nenqing in DC 387. The third party in the present suit was the plaintiff’s former lawyer in DC 387. In my decision, I shall refer to AXA Insurance Pte Ltd as the first defendant and Guo Nenqing as the second defendant.

2       On 21 March 2017, the plaintiff obtained interlocutory judgment in DC 387 against the second defendant where the second defendant was to pay the plaintiff 100% of the damages to be assessed and costs to be agreed or taxed. On 8 October 2019, the plaintiff obtained final judgment against the second defendant where the second defendant was to pay the plaintiff the sum of $50,000 which was inclusive of interest and the interim payment of $5,000. This amount comprised of $40,000 as general damages and $10,000 as special damages. The cheque for $30,000 out of the final judgment sum of $50,000 was made out by the first defendant in favour of Carson Law Chambers of which the third party is the sole proprietor. This cheque was banked into the office account of Carson Law Chambers.

3       It was undisputed that the plaintiff did not receive the $30,000 sum. As a result, he commenced the present suit against the first defendant to seek payment of the $30,000 sum. The first defendant in turn sought an indemnity against the third party in the event that the first defendant was found liable to the plaintiff.

4       After hearing the evidence and considering the parties’ submissions, I decided to grant the plaintiff’s declarations as sought for in his Statement of Claim. In addition, I also granted judgment against the first defendant in favour of the plaintiff for the sum of $30,000 with interest at the statutory rate of 5.33% per annum thereon from 8 October 2019 to date of judgment and costs on indemnity basis payable by the first defendant to the plaintiff’s solicitors. I also ordered that the first defendant indemnified the plaintiff for his costs and disbursements incurred in this suit.

5       I also found the third party liable to indemnify the first defendant for the sum of $30,000 with statutory interest of 5.33% per annum thereon from 8 October 2019 to date of judgment and ordered a partial indemnity for legal costs and disbursements incurred in these proceedings. I set out the grounds for my decision below.

## Facts

### The parties

6       In DC 387, it was adjudged On 21 March 2017 that interlocutory judgment be entered such that the second defendant was to pay the plaintiff 100% of the damages to be assessed and costs to be agreed or taxed on 21 March 2017. Final judgment was entered on 8 October 2019 by consent against the second defendant for the sum of $50,000 (inclusive of interest and interim payment of $5,000) with costs and disbursements to be agreed or taxed on 8 October 2019. The plaintiff had four different law firms acting for him throughout the litigation proceedings in DC 387. The plaintiff’s first set of lawyers was Regency Legal LLP which filed DC 387 on his behalf. On 18 November 2016[^1], Regency Legal LLP wrote to Ari Goh & Partners which acted for the first defendant requesting for an interim payment sum of $5,000. The request was for a cheque of $5,000 to be made in favour of Regency Legal LLP. The interim payment was paid to Regency Legal LLP on 24 January 2017 upon such request of the law firm[^2].

7       On 21 April 2018, C. Yogarajah LLC filed a Notice of Change of Solicitors to take over the legal representation of the plaintiff in DC 387. On 8 October 2018, C. Yogarajah LLC filed a Notice of Ceasing to Act as Solicitor. This meant that C. Yogarajah LLC was acting for the plaintiff between 21 April 2018 and 7 October 2018. The plaintiff was unrepresented from 8 October 2018 to 22 October 2018.

8       On 23 October 2018, Carson Law Chambers filed a Notice of Appointment of Solicitors to act for the plaintiff in DC 387. On 13 November 2019, the plaintiff discharged Carson Law Chambers and appointed Joseph Chen & Co (which remained as the plaintiff’s lawyer to-date) by way of Notice of Change of Solicitors filed and served on Carson Law Chambers and Willy Tay Chambers (which took over from Ari, Goh & Partners) at 1.59pm on 13 November 2019.[^3] So Carson Law Chambers represented the plaintiff from 23 October 2018 to 13 November 2019. Joseph Chen & Co represented the plaintiff from 13 November 2019 to 26 November 2019 as on 27 November 2019, Carson Law Chambers filed a Notice of Appointment of Solicitors. This meant that Carson Law Chambers represented the plaintiff from 27 November 2019 to 6 December 2019 as Joseph Chen &Co filed the necessary papers of representation on 6 December 2019. The critical time period was the day of 13 November 2019.

9       By way of a letter dated 13 November 2019[^4] from Willy Tay’s Chambers enclosing a cheque from the first defendant for $30,000[^5], this letter was addressed to Carson Law Chambers. A “Corrine Soh” of Carson Law Chambers acknowledged receipt of the letter and cheque on 14 November 2019 at 3.19pm. According to a letter dated 22 November 2019 written by Willy Tay’s Chambers sent to Joseph Chen & Co, the cheque was encashed by Carson Law Chambers[^6]. As the attempts made by the plaintiff and Joseph Chen & Co to pursue the sum of $30,000 were futile, the writ of summons was filed by Joseph Chen & Co on 4 February 2020.

10     A total of three witnesses gave evidence in court. They were the plaintiff, the first defendant’s representative Tan Chai Geok and the first defendant’s lawyer in DC 387, Mr Willy Tay (“Mr Tay”). The third party chose not to take the witness stand.

## The Parties’ Cases

### The plaintiff’s version

11     According to the plaintiff, other than the disputed sum of $30,000, the first defendant had paid the rest of the amounts ordered in the final judgment.[^7] The plaintiff took the position that the first defendant had wrongly given the cheque of $30,000 to Carson Law Chambers as the latter had been discharged from acting for the plaintiff. He was entitled to be paid $30,000 as the payment of this sum to Carson Law Chambers did not discharge the first defendant’s strict statutory liability under section 9(1)(b)(ii) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed[^8]) ( “the Act”). According to the plaintiff, this amount was to be paid directly to the plaintiff[^9].

12     The plaintiff also claimed that the third party was not even his lawyer during the period 26 November 2019 to 6 December 2019 as the third party had filed Notice of Appointment of Solicitors on 26 November 2019 to take back conduct of DC 387 without the plaintiff’s authority and consent. According to the plaintiff, Joseph Chen & Co even filed Notice of Change of Solicitors on 6 December 2019 to negate the third party’s unauthorised acts.

13     By making the cheque in favour of Carson Law Chambers, the first defendant had breached Order 29, Rule 13 and Order 22, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) in failing to pay the $30,000 directly to him. The first defendant did not obtain authority from the plaintiff to make payment to the plaintiff’s lawyer instead of paying directly to the plaintiff.

### The first defendant’s version

14     The first defendant was represented by Mr Tay in the conduct of DC 387. According to Mr Tay, after the consent final judgment was entered on 8 October 2019, there was no action taken to extract the final judgment or to finalise costs and disbursements. The first defendant was therefore anxious about the issue of post-judgment interest arising from the lack of urgency in resolving the matter. [^10]So Mr Tay advised the first defendant to render a further payment of $30,000 to pre-empt concerns about post judgment interest. After taking into consideration the interim payment of $5,000 already paid, the payment of additional $30,000 would mean a buffer of $15,000 to account for any potential solicitor-client costs payable by the plaintiff to his lawyers[^11].

15     According to Mr Tay, he sent the letter enclosing the cheque of $30,000 to Carson Law Chambers as he was unaware that Joseph Chen & Co had filed a Notice of Change of Solicitors to replace Carson Law Chambers as the plaintiff’s lawyer. On 17 November 2019, Mr Tay received a letter from Joseph Chen & Co informing him that Joseph Chen & Co had taken over the conduct of the matter from the third party and not to send any cheques for interim payment to the third party. In reply, Mr Tay sent a letter dated 19 November 2019 informing Joseph Chen & Co that an interim payment of $30,000 was sent earlier to Carson Law Chambers. Mr Tay was informed by the first defendant that this cheque was presented and cleared for payment on 15 November 2019 by Carson Law Chambers.

16     Up until 26 November 2019, the plaintiff had not raised any issue in relation to the third party accepting the second interim payment on his behalf especially since the third party continued to act for the plaintiff on 27 November 2019.[^12] On 27 November 2019, Joseph Chen sent a letter asserting that the third party had no authority to receive the $30,000 payment.

17     The first defendant’s position was that it had already discharged its duties and responsibilities when its cheque for $30,000 was presented and cleared and was therefore not liable to pay $30,000 the plaintiff. If at all, the plaintiff had wrongly sued the first defendant and should instead pursue his claim directly against the third party. In its third party statement of claim, the first defendant pleaded that the third party had wrongfully detained or converted the sum of $30,000 which was meant to be interim damages to the plaintiff in his office account without accounting to the plaintiff. The third party had omitted to handover the sum to the plaintiff when the third party had no authority to accept. In addition, the third party had neglected or omitted to return the sum to the first defendant despite repeated demands. Alternatively, the third party had been unjustly and wrongfully enriched by the sum at the detriment of the first defendant who were now being pursued by the plaintiff for payment of this sum.

### The third party’s version

18     The third party filed a bare defence.[^13] According to the third party[^14], Carson Law Chambers did not earn a single cent from the plaintiff in professional legal fees for DC 387. The firm had incurred a lot of disbursements and the plaintiff often approached the third party to borrow money saying that he was jobless. The third party believed that the plaintiff changed legal representation in order to deprive the third party of the legal fees. The third party elected not to testify in court.

## Parties’ objections before and during trial

### AEICS of Tammar Razu s/o Doraisamy and David Selvaraj s/o Moses

19     Prior to the first day of trial on 15 September 2020, three AEICS were filed by the third party without leave of court on 14 September 2020. These were AEICs deposed by one Tammar Razu s/o Doraisamy (“Tammar Razu”) and one David Selvaraj s/o Moses (“David Selvaraj”). On the first day of trial before the hearing the evidence of the first witness, the plaintiff took preliminary objection as these AEICs were filed without leave of court and were prejudicial to the plaintiff.

20     I agreed with the plaintiff and disallowed these AEICs to be produced at trial as these were indeed filed at doorstep of trial without adequate explanation as to why these AEICS were not produced earlier given that they were allegedly known and material witnesses for the defence. Both Tammar Razu and David Selvaraj were not in the list of witnesses identified for the trial. The prejudice caused to the plaintiff due to this late inclusion was significant and cannot be compensated with costs as the AEICs would change the entire complexion of the defence as borne out by the pleadings filed by the first defendant and the third party. The defence of the third party as pleaded was that the plaintiff owed him professional legal fees. Inclusion of the AEICs would introduce a new defence that part of the $30,000 was used to settle the plaintiff’s debts as agreed or instructed by the plaintiff.

21     In _Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v Intraco Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] SGCA 9</span>, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against the decision of the judicial commissioner in disallowing an order for voluntary particulars to stand as part of pleadings as to do so would introduce a new cause of action. Along the same vein, in the present suit, allowing these AEICs would be tantamount to introducing a new defence to the action. On this basis, I disallowed the these AEICs to be adduced at trial.

### Improper Jurat in the plaintiff’s AEIC affirmed on 17 June 2020

22     In the course of cross-examination of the plaintiff, the plaintiff conceded that although he was able to speak some English, he was not able to understand written English. The first defendant and the third party then took issue with the jurat in the plaintiff’s AEIC in that the jurat of his AEIC did not comply with Form 78 of the Rules of Court which applies to deponents who are illiterate in English. They submitted that the Court should strike out the plaintiff’s AEIC which would mean that his claim would accordingly be dismissed. As a result of the contention raised by the first defendant and the third party, the Commissioner for Oaths, Mr MS Rajendran who attended to the affirmation of the plaintiff’s AEIC on 17 June 2020, was called to the stand to testify how much of the contents was understood by the plaintiff when the contents were explained to the plaintiff at the time of the affirmation.

23     The Commissioner for Oaths testified that the plaintiff was only able to understand 60-70% of what was explained to him. Hence, the AEIC was not in compliance with Order 41, Rule 3 as well.

24     After hearing parties and read their written submissions, I granted the plaintiff leave to file a fresh AEIC containing the proper jurat but with no new contents included. My order was for the fresh AEIC to be affirmed before a different Commissioner for Oaths. Costs were reserved to end of the trial.

25     My reasons for granting the plaintiff leave to file a fresh AEIC were that firstly, the Court has discretion to allow the use of an affidavit “notwithstanding _any_ irregularity” under Order 41, Rule 4.  The elaboration at \[41/4/1\] in _SINGAPORE CIVIL PROCEDURE 2020 VOLUME 1_ (Sweet and Maxwell and Thomson Reuters, 2020) states that “if the irregularity can be cured without undue hardship or it is not a matter of substance or affects it actual contents, then it should be put right.”   It was difficult for the first defendant and third party to argue that they were likely to suffer undue hardship from regularisation of the AEIC.  The defective AEIC was filed very early on in June 2020 as part of the trial set down directions.  The first defendant and third party cannot be said to be taken by surprise.  On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that the duty of the court was to examine all evidence put forth by the parties which was material and relevant to the dispute between the parties and not to shut out potentially material and relevant evidence by strict adherence to the rules of civil procedure[^15] . The first defendant and third party had not alleged that the contents of the defective AEIC were immaterial or irrelevant.   

26     To disallow the plaintiff opportunity to regularise the AEIC would impose undue hardship and prejudice on the plaintiff. Neither the first defendant and third party had filed any Notices of Objections to the contents of the AEIC prior to trial or at any point in time and it was arguable that the plaintiff was taken by surprise. This was despite the Court Order dated 21 April 2020 stating that all such objections were to be filed by 23 June 2020. No Notices had been filed nor had there been an application for extension of time to file such a Notice.

27     The first defendant and third party had cited three Malaysian cases[^16] for the proposition that failure to comply with Order 41, Rule 3 was a serious defect that cannot be termed irregular and cannot be cured under Order 41, Rule 4. I declined to follow the position stated in these persuasive authorities as this was not settled law even in Malaysia. _Ipmuda Trading_ cited by the third party could be distinguished as the affidavit in question was not even signed by the Commissioner for Oaths which led to the High Court of Melaka to find that the document was not even an affidavit. Here, the AEIC was signed by the Commissioner for Oaths who spent two hours reading and explaining the AEIC to the plaintiff in simple English.

## Issues to be determined

28     The issues to be determined were as follows:

> Issue 1- Was the first defendant liable to pay the plaintiff the sum of $30,000?

> Issue 2- Was the third party liable to indemnify the first defendant for the sum of $30,000?

## Issue 1: Was the first defendant liable to pay the sum of $30,000 to the plaintiff?

### Were the first defendant’s payment obligations discharged upon its cheque payment of $30,000 on 13 November 2019 which was subsequently encashed by the third party on 15 November 2019?

29     I found that the first defendant’s payment obligations had not been discharged upon its cheque payment of $30,000 on 13 November 2019 and which was subsequently encashed by the third party on 15 November 2019.

30     I agreed with the plaintiff that he was entitled to be paid $30,000 as the payment for this sum to Carson Law Chambers did not discharge the first defendant’s strict statutory liability under section 9(1)(b)(ii) of the Act. Section 9(1)(b) provides:

>     “ where the sum payable (excluding any amount payable in respect of costs and interest by virtue of any written law relating to interest on judgments) under the judgment to any person entitled to the benefit of the judgment in respect of the liability exceeds the relevant amount, the insurer shall-

>> (i)    Pay that sum, together with any amount payable in respect of costs and interest on the sum by virtue of any written law relating to interest on judgments, directly to the Public Trustee as trustee to the person if the person is a specified person and the judgment requires the sum to be paid to the Public Trustee as trustee for the person; or

>> (ii)   In any other case, pay that sum, together with any amount payable in respect of costs and interest on the sum by virtue of any written law relating to interest on judgments, _directly to the person_ in accordance with the judgment and with any rules made under this Act.” (emphasis mine)

31     A plain reading of section 9 (1)(b) (ii) which applied to the present suit was clear that this amount was to be paid directly to the plaintiff. Here, the sum of $30,000 was instead paid to Carson Law Chambers instead of the plaintiff, resulting in Carson Law Chambers encashing it on 15 November 2019. So did the first defendant’s payment under a mistake of law result in the plaintiff being unable to claim the $30,000? I was of the view that the plaintiff could still claim the $30,000.

32     In _Re PCChip Computer Manufacturer (S) Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation)_ \[2001\] 2 SLR (R) 180, judicial commissioner Lee Seiu Kin ( as he then was) ordered that money paid under a mistake was to be refunded by the liquidators, regardless of whether it was paid under mistake of fact or law when four conditions were satisfied. Firstly, there must be some form of enrichment of the assets of the defendant by the claimant. Secondly, the claimant must not be in the position of submitting an ordinary proof of debt. Thirdly, in all the circumstances of the case, an honest person would consider that it would only be fair that to return the money to the claimant. Finally, the principle applies only to the extent necessary to nullify the enrichment of the defendant.

33     In the present suit, all four conditions existed such that the sum of $30,000 should be refunded to the plaintiff as he was the party entitled to such payment in the first place. The third party had unjustly received the sum of $30,000 which was intended for the plaintiff’s claim in DC 387. As the injured party of a motor accident in DC 387, it was only fair that the plaintiff received the payment intended as compensation for the damages and injuries he suffered in the motor accident.

34     In the very unlikely event that my interpretation of section 9(1)(b)(ii) of the Act was mistaken, I was of the view that the plaintiff could still claim the $30,000 as there had been a mistake of fact as to who was the plaintiff’s lawyer when the cheque was made out to and despatched by the first defendant’s lawyer to Carson Law Chambers.

35     At \[18\], \[19\] and \[22\] of the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff pleaded that the third party had been discharged from representing the plaintiff as at 13 November 2019 and the first defendant had wrongfully paid the $30,000 to the “**wrong party/person**” as highlighted in bold at \[22\]. In short, the $30,000 payment was mistakenly paid out to the third party. I found that the first defendant’s payment obligation to the plaintiff had not been discharged even though the first defendant’s cheque payment of the $30,000 was encashed by the third party on 15 November 2019. This was because the payment was made under a mistake of fact in that Mr Tay had admittedly been labouring under the mistaken belief that Carson Law Chambers was still acting for the plaintiff[^17]. As the payment was made under a mistake of fact to the wrong law firm and wrong party, it was recoverable as it was a mistake of fact, such mistake caused the payment and mistake was connected with the payee.

36     In the Singapore High Court authority cited by the plaintiff _Standard Chartered Bank v Sin Chong Hua Electric & Trading Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] SGHC 121</span>, Justice Goh Joon Seng ordered the money paid out to beneficiary under a mistake of fact could recover the money.

37     Having made the rulings as stated above, there was no need for me to go further to rule on the plaintiff’s assertions relating to purported violations of some provisions of the Rules of Court. For completeness, I shall cover these assertions. The plaintiff asserted that by making the cheque in favour of Carson Law Chambers, the first defendant had breached Order 29, Rule 13 and Order 22, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court in failing to pay the $30,000 directly to him. I shall first deal with Order 29, Rule 13. It provides that:

>     “13.-(1) Subject to Order 76, Rule 12, the amount of any interim payment ordered to be made shall be paid to the plaintiff unless the order provides for it to be paid into Court, and where the amount is paid into Court, the Court may, on the application of the plaintiff, order the whole or any part of it be paid out to him at such time or times as the Court thinks fit.”

38     This argument made by the plaintiff was misconceived as Order 29, Rule 13 did not apply to the present suit. Order 29, Rule 9 interprets what “interim payments” are. It provides that:

> “9.    For the purposes of _Rules 10 to 18_, “interim payments”, in relation to a defendant, means a payment on account of any damages, debt or other sum (excluding costs) which he _may be held liable to pay to or for the benefit of the plaintiff;_ and any reference to the plaintiff or defendant includes a reference to any person who, for the purpose of the proceedings, acts as litigation representative of the plaintiff or guardian of the defendant.” (emphasis mine)

39     In the present suit, the $30,000 interim payment was not the interim payment envisaged under Order 29. This was because this $30,000 was actually part payment of the final judgment sum of $50,000 which meant that it was not money which the defendant “may be held liable to pay” as provided under Order 29, Rule 9. At \[29/9/1\] of the _SINGAPORE CIVIL PROCEDURE 2020 VOLUME 1_ found at page 684, there is an explanation that interim payment applies to a party in pending proceedings to make interim payments to another party. Here, with the entry of final judgment in favour of the plaintiff prior to the cheque of $30,000, there was no pending proceedings. As such, Order 29, Rule 13 did not apply.

40     Moving on to Order 22, Rule 10, it provides that:

> “10.-(1)    Where the party entitled to money in Court is a person in respect of whom a certificate is or has been in force entitling him to legal aid under the Legal Aid and Advice Act (Cap.170), payment shall be made only to that party’s solicitor, or, if he is not represented by a solicitor, then, if the Court so orders, to the Director of Legal Aid, without the need for any authority from the party.

> (2)    Subject to paragraph (1), payment shall be made to the party entitled or, on his written, to his solicitor or, if the Court so orders, to his solicitor without such authority.

> (3)    This Rule applies whether the money in Court has been paid into Court under Rule 1 or under the order of the Court or a certificate of the Registrar.”

41     The plaintiff’s case was that the first defendant did not obtain authority from the plaintiff to make payment to the plaintiff’s lawyer instead of payment to the plaintiff. Mr Tay had also conceded that no authority was given by the plaintiff for payment of the $30,000 to his lawyer. The plaintiff was misconceived about the application of Order 22, Rule 10 which governed the payments of money into and out of Court. It was not applicable to the payment of the $30,000 which was a partial payment of the final judgment sum of $50,000. In this respect, I took guidance from the _SINGAPORE CIVIL PROCEDURE 2020 VOLUME 1_. At \[22/0/2\] found at page 450, it was stated that the rules underpinning payment into and out of Court were instituted to direct the manner in which the Court should exercise its discretion as to costs endeavour to encourage the settlement of proceedings. In the present suit, the matter was already concluded as final judgment had been obtained in favour of the plaintiff.

### Did third party’s defence that he was owed professional legal fees entitle him to encash the cheque?

42     It was undisputed that the third party had banked in the $30,000 into the office account of Carson Law Chambers. As the third party had elected not to testify in court, the contents of his AEIC would be inadmissible. In addition, the third party had filed a bare defence. Therefore, I found that the third party had no defence to the claim made by the defendants. For completeness, I found that even if it were true that the plaintiff owed the third party professional legal fees as stated in the third party’s AEIC, this did not entitle the third party to encash the cheque in an attempt to recover the legal fees. This was because if this allegation were true, there were other more appropriate avenues for the third party to pursue outstanding professional legal fees. The sum was intended for his former client’s motor accident claim. As a lawyer, the third party would be aware of these other avenues. Yet, he chose not to do so. For example, the third party could have commenced a lawsuit against the plaintiff for outstanding professional legal fees.

43     According to the third party[^18], the Court in DC 387 granted judgment for $50,000 and indicated costs at $18,000. Hence, the third party’s solicitor-client costs would be far less than the $30,000. I noted that Mr Tay gave evidence in court that he deemed $15,000 as a sufficient amount for the solicitor-client costs that was payable by the plaintiff to his lawyers, hence the cheque was made out for $30,000. This was because party to party costs was payable separately on top of the $50,000 final judgment sum. Even taking the third party’s case at its highest, this would leave a substantial remaining balance unaccounted for. Yet the third party made no attempt to return this balance sum despite the repeated demands made by Joseph Chen & Co.

44     Having made the above rulings, it was not necessary for this Court to go further to determine if it was improper for the third party to have banked in the $30,000 into the office account of Carson Law Chambers as opposed to client’s account.

### Should the plaintiff have sued the third party directly?

45     The first defendant’s argument was that the plaintiff should have sued the third party directly as the first defendant’s payment obligations had been discharged with the encashment of the cheque for $30,000. I found this argument to be unmeritorious. Firstly, I had earlier ruled and given my reasons that the first defendant’s payment obligations had not been discharged. Secondly, the plaintiff’s judgment was entered against the defendants and as the $30,000 was paid pursuant to this judgment, the plaintiff could rightfully choose to pursue payment of this sum from the first defendants.

## Issue 2: Was the third party liable to indemnify the first defendant the sum of $30,000?

46     I found the third party liable to indemnify the first defendant as the third party had wrongfully banked in the cheque for $30,000 into an account of Carson Law Chambers. On either 14 or 15 November 2019, the third party proceeded to bank in the cheque although he would have known by that time, that he was no longer counsel acting for the plaintiff by virtue of the Notice of Change of Solicitors filed and served on him by Joseph Chen & Co one or two days earlier on 13 November 2019 at 1.59pm. Further, the covering letter written by Mr Tay enclosing the cheque of $30,000 was clear that the $30,000 was interim payment towards damages and not for the payment of the third party’s costs. It followed that even if the third party was re-instructed on 27 November 2019 to present the plaintiff, the third party still did not have the authority to keep the money and use it to off-set outstanding professional fees.

47     Looking at the number of correspondences between Joseph Chen & Co and the third party, there had been a number of occasions after 15 November 2019 that the third party could have returned the part or all the money but he did not do so.

48     Therefore, I dismissed the third party’s defence and found him liable to indemnify the first defendant accordingly.

## Conclusion

49     For the above reasons, I found that the plaintiff had established his case against the first defendant and I granted judgment in the favour of the plaintiff as stated above and also ordered that the first defendant be indemnified accordingly.

50     It is trite that costs are entirely in the discretion of the Court under Order 59, Rule 2(2) of the Rules of Court. After hearing submissions from parties, I fixed costs and disbursements bearing in mind the conduct of parties before and during the trial and I was guided by \[59/2/1\] of _SINGAPORE CIVIL PROCEDURE 2020 VOLUME 1_ at page 1086. In the present suit, it was just for the plaintiff to be indemnified by the first defendant as the plaintiff was entitled to the amount claimed as it was meant as compensation for his damages suffered in DC 387. However, the first defendant decided not to pay the plaintiff and instead chose to continue with the lawsuit and instituted third party proceedings resulting in the plaintiff being subjected to the time and expense of a trial.
