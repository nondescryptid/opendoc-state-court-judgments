Criminal Law – Failing to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of duty as director – Section 157(1) Companies Act, Chapter 50, 2006 Rev Ed – Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentence – Disqualification

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9057/2022/01.\]

29 July 2022

### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The offences are set in 2012 when the Accused took on the directorships of four companies, Naylor Trading Pte Ltd, Stretton Pte Ltd, Abassco Pte Ltd, Rivoli Pte Ltd (hereafter, “the Companies”).

2       At the material time, the Accused was the managing director of 3E Accounting Pte Ltd (“3E”). He was also the founder of 3E[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). Part of 3E’s business involved providing corporate secretarial services as well as nominee director services[^2]. Since it was a requirement that every company incorporated in Singapore must have at least one director who is ordinarily resident in Singapore[^3], foreigners who wished to incorporate companies in Singapore would seek the services of Corporate Service Providers (CSPs) in Singapore such as 3E, to provide what was commonly known as “nominee director” services. It was in this context that 3E’s services were sought in 2012 and in this capacity that the Accused became the director of the Companies.

## Charges

3       The Accused claimed trial to these four charges:

> **_DCN 900008/2018_**

> _You, are charged that you, being a director of Naylor Trading Pte Ltd (“Naylor Trading”) from 2 October 2012 to 6 September 2013, did fail to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of your duties as a director of Naylor Trading, to wit, by failing to exercise any supervision over the affairs of Naylor Trading which resulted in Naylor Trading dealing with properties designated as “stolen properties” under s 410 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition) and you have thereby breached section 157(1) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50, 2006 Revised Edition) and committed an offence punishable under section 157(3)(b) of the said Act._

> **_DCN 900009/2018_**

> _You, are charged that you, being a director of Stretton Pte Ltd (“Stretton”) from 2 October 2012 to 19 February 2014, did fail to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of your duties as a director of Stretton, to wit, by failing to exercise any supervision over the affairs of Stretton which resulted in Stretton dealing with properties designated as “stolen properties” under s 410 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition) and you have thereby breached section 157(1) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50, 2006 Revised Edition) and committed an offence punishable under section 157(3)(b) of the said Act._

> **_DCN 900010/2018_**

> _You, are charged that you, being a director of Abassco Pte Ltd (“Abassco”) from 2 October 2012 to 19 February 2014, did fail to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of your duties as a director of Abassco, to wit, by failing to exercise any supervision over the affairs of Abassco which resulted in Abassco dealing with properties designated as “stolen properties” under s 410 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition) and you have thereby breached section 157(1) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50, 2006 Revised Edition) and committed an offence punishable under section 157(3)(b) of the said Act._

> **_DCN 900011/2018_**

> _You, are charged that you, being a director of Rivoli Pte Ltd (“Rivoli”) from 2 October 2012 to 19 February 2014, did fail to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of your duties as a director of Rivoli, to wit, by failing to exercise any supervision over the affairs of Rivoli which resulted in Rivoli dealing with properties designated as “stolen properties” under s 410 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and you have thereby breached section 157(1) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50, 2006 Revised Edition) and committed an offence punishable under section 157(3)(b) of the said Act._

## Conviction And Sentences Imposed

4       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on all four charges.

5       I imposed three weeks’ imprisonment on each of the four charges, ordering the imprisonment terms in DCN 900008/2018 and DCN 900009/2018 to run consecutively. I further ordered that the Accused be disqualified from directorship for five years, a disqualification which was effective from the date of conviction and would continue for five years upon his release from prison[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). The total sentence was: six weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification of five years.

6       The Accused appealed against his conviction and sentence.

## The Prosecution’s Case

7       The Prosecution’s case comprised 12 witnesses:

> (a)     Five current/former Commercial Affairs Officers (CAO) from the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) who testified in respect of the recording of the statements of the Accused and/or of efforts made to contact foreign witnesses who were unable to attend trial[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5);

> (b)     Five other witnesses were victims who were defrauded or who acted on fraudulent instructions[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6);

> (c)     A representative from DBS who explained the processes adopted by the bank in 2012[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7); and

> (d)     PW1 Mun Wai Ho Kelvin, who was a director of Margin Wheeler Pte Ltd (“MW”) who first incorporated the Companies.

8       Three statements of the Accused were admitted in the course of trial, without challenge as to admissibility. They were recorded on:

> (a)     19 February 2013 (Exhibit P31);

> (b)     14 June 2013 (Exhibit P33); and

> (c)     5 June 2014 (Exhibit P34).

### Undisputed Facts

9       There was no dispute on these facts:

> (a)     That the Accused was a director of the Companies from the time he registered himself as a director of each of the Companies until the date the Companies were struck off (dates as specified in each of the charges); and

> (b)     That the Companies had dealt with “_stolen property_” under section 410 of the Penal Code.

10     In the course of the Accused’s directorships in the Companies, several police reports were lodged against the Companies. PW5 Ong Chee An, PW6 Low Choon Foi, PW7 Lau Seng Heng, PW8 Chung Ting Fai testified in court of how they were defrauded into remitting monies into the corporate bank accounts of the Companies. The evidence of other victims in relation to the same, were received by way of conditioned statements. A table summarising their evidence is produced below:-

 

11     On the evidence, it was clear that monies in respect of which cheating had been committed, had been transferred into the corporate bank accounts of the Companies. These monies received in the Companies’ corporate bank accounts were “_stolen property_” as defined in section 410 of the Penal Code[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13).

12     The key issue in this case was whether the Accused’s failure to exercise any supervision over the affairs of these Companies fell short of the standard of reasonable diligence expected of company directors in the discharge of their duties and resulted in these Companies dealing with stolen property.

### How Accused Became Director Of The Companies

13     Most of the facts leading up to the Accused becoming director of the Companies were also undisputed. Key facts, as summarised by the Prosecution[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) were:

> (a)     The Companies were first incorporated by PW1 Mun Wai Ho Kelvin (“Kelvin Mun”) between June 2012 and July 2012. At the material time, Kelvin was working in Margin Wheeler Private Limited (“MW”), an accounting and corporate secretarial firm that provided, inter alia, company incorporation and nominee director services;

> (b)     Pursuant to an agreement between MW and one “Iho Khal_”_, Kelvin Mun incorporated a total of six entities, including the Companies, on behalf of “Iho Khal”s foreign clients. To satisfy the requirements of the Companies Act, Kelvin Mun was named as the local resident director of the Companies at the time of their incorporation;

> (c)     Following the incorporation of the Companies, Kelvin Mun made applications to several local banks for the opening of corporate bank accounts for the Companies. As part of the application process, Kelvin Mun submitted several documents that he obtained from “Iho Khal” to the banks, including bank testimonials in respect of the foreign directors of the Companies;.

> (d)     Kelvin Mun’s applications to DBS in respect of the Companies were approved, and DBS corporate banking accounts for each company were established. However, both UOB and OCBC rejected his application[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15);

> (e)     Subsequently, upon checking, Kelvin Mun was informed by Credit Suisse that the name reflected on a Credit Suisse bank testimonial did not appear in their database. On receiving that information, Kelvin Mun felt “_there might really be something wrong_”[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16). Accordingly, Kelvin Mun decided that he would cease providing services to “Iho Kal”’s foreign clients as he suspected that the Companies were involved in fraudulent activities;

> (f)     Kelvin Mun then advised “Iho Kal” that the DBS corporate banking accounts of the Companies should be closed, and that “Iho Khal” would need to find another local resident director to take over Kelvin’s directorship position in the Companies if he (“Iho Kal”) wished to maintain the said corporate banking accounts. Kelvin Mun also lodged a police report in respect of the information he obtained from Credit Suisse.

> (g)     Subsequently, Kelvin Mun received an email from one Stephanie Chua of 3E, who informed him that they would be providing secretarial services and taking over as nominee director for the Companies;

> (h)     As it turned out, one “Florina” had contacted the Accused via email and asked for the price of 3E’s services in August or September 2012. She informed the Accused that she had companies that required the Accused’s company’s corporate secretarial and nominee director services. The Accused agreed to provide the services to the Companies. He signed an agreement to be the corporate secretary and nominee directors of six companies, four of which were the Companies that Kelvin incorporated;

> (i)     With the contact passed to him through “Florina”, the Accused contacted Kelvin Mun to inform him that he would be replacing Kelvin Mun as the local resident director in the Companies;

> (j)     On 2 October 2012, the Accused registered himself as the director in the Companies. Kelvin Mun also subsequently handed over the corporate secretarial files of the Companies to 3E.

## Burden On The Prosecution

14     The Prosecution had to prove the following[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17):

> (a)     That the Accused failed to exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies;

> (b)     In failing to exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies, such conduct of the Accused failed to meet the standard of reasonable diligence expected of a director in the same position as the Accused;

> (c)     As a result of the Accused’s failure to exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies, the Companies dealt with stolen property.

## The Accused Failed To Exercise Any Supervision Over The Affairs Of The Companies

15     The Defence submitted that the term “_supervision_” was not a term of art and a plain and ordinary meaning should be attributed to it[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18). Based on the various definitions ascribed to the term, Defence submitted that “_it boldly involves a degree of monitoring or managing of activities and/or individuals_”[^19]. I was willing to accept the ordinary meaning of the word “_supervision_” as ascribed to it by the Defence. However, on the evidence, I found that the Accused did not exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies.

### Accused’s Admissions In His Statements

16     The contents of the Accused’s statements to the CAD at various points of the investigation, were telling of the state of mind of the Accused at the time when he took on the directorship of the Companies and that impacted his conduct throughout the time he sat as director in the Companies under his charge.

17     When it came to being a nominee director of companies, the Accused admitted in his statements that:

> (a)     he will not do a thorough background check on the foreign directors because it will be “_very costly_”[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20); he relied heavily on the checks done by banks;

> (b)     he will not check the business activities of the companies. Depending on the availability of bank statements, he will question the companies if he sees a large sum of transactions in their bank accounts before asking for supporting documents to verify the business activity[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21).

18     Specifically in relation to the company Abassco, the Accused stated in his statement recorded on 5 June 2014 (Exhibit P34) that he did not know its business activities[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22); he did not perform any due diligence before taking over the directorship. He did not perform any checks on the passport or background of the foreign director, one “Syed”[^23]. Consistent with his admissions in his earlier statements, it was likely that the Accused had approached his directorships in the other three companies in the same manner.

19     It was evident from his statement in Exhibit P31 that the Accused was eager to take over as nominee director of the Companies. He was “_willing to take up the risk_” despite knowing that Kelvin Mun had terminated the corporate secretarial and nominee directorships for the companies, because he (the Accused) wanted to “_expand the business_”[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24). When the Accused took over directorship from Kelvin Mun, he only knew the principal activities of the Companies from ACRA[^25]; he was not aware of any places of operations for the Companies[^26]; he did not review any documents for these Companies[^27]. The Accused relied on the checks done by Kelvin Mun[^28]. The Accused did not know the purpose of the incorporation of the Companies in Singapore[^29]; he did not see any of the foreign directors[^30]; he did not know the role and job scope of the foreign directors, neither did he ask[^31].

20     The Accused stated that whilst he did not do a thorough background check on the foreign directors, he would usually do a basic check by asking the foreign directors for their bank reference and lawyer’s letter to check their financial standing and credibility[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32). However, no such documents were furnished by the Accused to CAD at any time during the investigations and/or adduced at trial.

21     In his statements, the Accused stated that Kelvin Mun had informed him that his company had changed their policy (hence, Kelvin Mun could not be the nominee director of the Companies anymore) and when he asked specifically, Kelvin Mun had told him there were “_no problems_” with the Companies[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33). In relation to Abassco, the Accused also stated that Kelvin Mun had stopped providing nominee directorship services because of the risks associated with it[^34].

22     However, these assertions by the Accused in his statements that he had made certain enquiries as to the Companies and had asked Kelvin Mun why he terminated his secretarial and nominee director services, were never put to Kelvin Mun when he was on the stand. In court, Kelvin Mun testified that nobody from 3E requested for the verification he had done on the directors of the Companies or the purpose of their business in Singapore[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35). Kelvin Mun did not remember the Accused asking him any questions about the Companies[^36] or why MW decided to end their services[^37]. Under cross-examination, Kelvin Mun explained that he did not communicate any of his suspicions to 3E because he did not want to pass information based on his assumptions to 3E, which could turn out wrong. This was so especially when DBS had approved the bank accounts[^38].

23     I was not troubled by the fact that the Accused’s statements were recorded in the context of an investigation under Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“CDSA”). Defence submitted that the warnings administered in all three statements were in respect of the CDSA and that the investigations against the Accused were not conducted within the framework of or in consideration of Section 157 of the Companies Act, suggesting that the Court ought to handle the material with circumspection[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39).

24     In my view, it did not strictly matter which offences were being investigated at the time the Accused gave his statements. The Accused was obliged to speak the truth in all of them, regardless of what offences the CAD may have been investigating and he was well-aware of that[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40). The Accused knew what the CAOs was asking; direct questions were put to the Accused. In response, the Accused’s answers were straightforward and clear. The Accused was given an opportunity to offer a full and complete explanation to the investigators of the checks he had done and the steps he had taken at the time he became a nominee director of the Companies. However, the Accused plainly stated he did not do any checks.

25     Overall, the Accused’s statements revealed a degree of laxity with which Accused had approached his role as nominee director in the Companies. This attitude of the Accused viz-a-viz his nominee directorship in the Companies was consistent with his testimony in court.

### Accused’s Admissions In His Testimony In Court

26     The casual manner in which Accused approached his role as nominee director of the Companies continued through his testimony in court. When asked to take on the role of nominee director in the Companies by one “Florina”, the Accused did not take steps to verify the identity of the person he was dealing with on email in respect of taking on nominee directorships of the Companies or the authority which “Florina” had to act on behalf of the Companies[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41). He did not check whether “Florina”, who was not listed as the foreign director of any of the Companies, was authorised to act for the Companies’ foreign directors[^42]. The Accused did not inquire into her role in the Companies[^43] and as far as the Accused was concerned, “Florina” mentioned that she was his point of contact[^44] for the Companies and he simply accepted it as such. As was apparent throughout his court testimony, the Accused took all his instructions from “Florina” without any question[^45], including instructions to send key bank documents over to foreign addresses.

27     On the stand, the Accused was aware that after he had taken over as director of the Companies even in a non-executive role, he had a continuing obligation to supervise, to have some oversight and understanding of the Companies’ financial affairs[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46). Yet, he did not check the purpose of the bank accounts of the Companies and stated that he knew they were for trading purposes based on “_their record_”, on the “_ACRA search_” and due diligence done by the bank[^47].He also did not obtain any documents which showed that the companies were running actual business, having assessed that that these companies were “_low-risk_” and he depended on the checks done by the bank[^48].

28     By the Accused’s own admissions both in court and in his CAD statements, it was clear that he neither conducted the necessary checks nor made any inquiries into the affairs of the Companies before or after he took on nominee directorship in the Companies.

### No Supervisory Structure

29     In his defence, the Accused asserted that he had in place a supervisory infrastructure. It was the Defence’s submission that the following were done[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49):

> (a)     The Accused had extracted relevant information on the Companies;

> (b)     He had checked the compliance status of the Companies;

> (c)     He had checked the tax filing status of the Companies;

> (d)     He had checked the nationality of the shareholders and directors;

> (e)     There was a requirement for corporate clients to sign the nominee director indemnity agreement, corporate secretarial agreement and address agreement;

> (f)     Imposing a requirement that 3E’s clients had to use 3E’s corporate secretarial and registered address services in addition to the nominee director services;

> (g)     The Accused/3E also took over the corporate secretarial files of the Companies and reviewed the documents; and

> (h)     He also signed authorization forms for 3E to collect the Companies’ common seals from MW.

30     The assertion by the Accused that the above steps had been taken in respect of the Companies was contrary to the evidence. First, there was no mention of any of these steps taken by the Accused in his statements to the CAD despite ample opportunity to do so. On the contrary, the Accused stated in his statements that he had not done any checks at all and proceeded to explain why he did not do so. As pointed out by the Prosecution[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50), in court, the Accused similarly stated that he did not carry out independent checks to verify the information in those searches[^51]. The Accused admitted that he neither knew if the Companies were actually involved in the business activities which was stated in the ACRA records[^52], nor asked for evidence from the foreign directors of such activities[^53].

31     Second, there was no documentation or paper trail in respect of any of the steps taken as part of this “_supervisory infrastructure_” which were submitted to the CAD as part of the investigations or even adduced in court.

32     Third, having clients sign various agreements, including a nominee director indemnity agreement and imposing a requirement that 3E’s corporate secretarial and registered address services must be used et cetera, did not amount to acts of supervision. These were steps 3E took to facilitate the Accused’s role as a nominee director and to indemnify themselves and/or the Accused against any liability or loss but they could not be described as steps amounting to supervision of the Companies. Further, making it the Companies’ responsibility to refrain from engaging in any illegal activities through the signing of agreements did not absolve the Accused from his duties as a director to supervise the Companies to ensure the Companies did not engage in illegal activities[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54).

33     The first mention by the Accused of the existence of a “_supervisory infrastructure_” was at trial, and it was a bare assertion. The mere confirmation adduced from PW2 CAO Tan Ruiyun (“CAO Ruiyun”) by the Defence in the course of cross-examination that the Accused had done all these checks did not render the Accused’s claim any stronger, particularly in the absence of any supporting evidence. There was also no elaboration on the basis on which CAO Ruiyun arrived at her conclusion that these checks were in fact done by the Accused. In my view, the claim that the Accused had in place a “_supervisory infrastructure_” was an afterthought on the part of the Accused. There was no evidence showing that there was ever such a “_supervisory structure_” in place at the time Accused became director of the Companies or even if there was, that the Accused had taken steps in accordance with the “_supervisory infrastructure_” at the material time.

### Reliance On Checks Done By Third Parties Did Not Amount To Supervision

34     As part of the Accused’s defence, it was submitted that:-

> (a)     it was reasonable for the Accused to have relied on and considered the due diligence conducted by his predecessor (a fellow professional in the industry)[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55). In his statement to the CAD, the Accused admitted that he did not conduct any background checks on the Companies as he “_expected_” Kelvin Mun to have done those checks. Similarly, at trial, the Accused testified that he placed reliance on the due diligence performed by MW[^56];

> (b)     Accused had no reason to doubt the legitimacy and authenticity of the incorporation documents of the Companies (in particular, Know-Your-Client (“KYC”) documents) since Kelvin Mun had compiled and relied on the same in opening the bank accounts of the Companies[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57);

> (c)     The Accused could rely on the diligence checks done by the banks through the bank account opening forms which were in the corporate secretarial files handed over on 1 November 2012, based on the Accused’s understanding that the bank’s due diligence checks were methodical and stringent[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58). Accused stated in his statement that banks were in the best position to check on the Companies’ business activities as they would be the first to know about transactions in a company’s bank accounts and to raise any suspicions[^59]. He added that the banks would check the backgrounds of the foreign directors before approving their application for corporate bank accounts. Therefore, if the banks had approved the said application, the companies and foreign directors “_should be fine_”[^60]. The Accused testified at trial that, for the present matter, he relied on DBS’s due diligence to verify the Companies’ directors’ identities and business activities[^61].

35     On the evidence, it appeared that the Accused did rely on checks done by the banks and Kelvin Mun/MW when he became the nominee directorship of the Companies. However, in my view, the Accused was not entitled to rely on checks done by the banks or by Kelvin Mun/MW. Being a nominee director of a company came with rights as well as obligations. Even as a nominee director, the Accused would be expected to fulfill basic duties as a director; to take personal responsibility in respect of the affairs of the Companies and to do his own independent checks. In this vein, even if I accept that Kelvin Mun had failed to make full and frank disclosure of matters relating to Companies to the Accused and/or did not alert him of his suspicions relating to the Companies, Kelvin Mun’s failure to do so did not absolve the Accused from the need to personally check and supervise the affairs of the Companies, whether prior to or upon becoming director.

36     Further, such reliance by the Accused was misplaced[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62). First, the Accused was unaware of the checks Kelvin Mun/MW had conducted in respect of the Companies - not having enquired from Kelvin Mun or MW what checks had been done and admitting that he only became aware of the checks done by Kelvin Mun at trial[^63]. He also did not know what checks the banks had done since all such information was confidential[^64]. In this regard, even if Kelvin Mun himself had relied on checks done by banks[^65], it did not make it right. Second, in choosing to rely on the checks done by third parties, the Accused conveniently made certain assumptions about the accuracy, quality and nature of the checks done by the banks and Kelvin Mun when he did not actually have a basis to do so.

37     The Accused’s reliance on checks done by third parties provided him an excuse not to carry out his own due diligence or perform his own checks. I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s reliance on the checks done by third parties did not discharge him of his obligations to personally check and/or to supervise the Companies’ affairs[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66). As pointed out by the Prosecution, as a local resident director, the Accused had a separate and continuing obligation to exercise due diligence over the affairs of the Companies; he could not simply rely on checks done by third parties[^67].

38     In any case, reliance on a first-tier local bank’s due diligence and/or on the checks done by Kelvin Mun/MW cannot amount to supervision. What the Accused did was merely accepting the results of checks done by others, and without verification. Even on the Defence’s own definition of “_supervision_” that “_it boldly involves a degree of monitoring or managing of activities and/or individuals”_, the Accused’s convenient act of relying on checks carried out by third parties can neither be said to be monitoring or managing the affairs of the Companies.

### Overall Inaction Of The Accused

39     Apart from his failure to conduct any checks prior to taking on nominee directorship of the Companies and after he became director, on the evidence, it was clear that there was overall inaction on the part of the Accused viz-a-viz the Companies after he became their nominee director:

> (a)     The Accused did not follow-up with effecting a change of mailing address (to 3E’s office) with the banks, resulting in bank statements and correspondence still sent to Kelvin Mun’s office[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68). PW12 Chan Mun Leong confirmed that from the time the bank accounts were opened until 2020, there has been no instructions for a change in mailing address for the Companies[^69]. Simply requesting that bank correspondence be sent to 3E’s address (without ensuring that it was done) cannot amount to supervision;

> (b)     The Accused never opened any bank letters in relation to the Companies[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70). In his statement to CAD, the Accused stated that he had “_never seen_” the bank documentation for Abassco before CAD investigations[^71]. In court, he testified that he would not open any bank letters in relation to the Companies in the absence of any “_red flags_” and that his standard operating procedure (“SOP”) only required him to review the bank statements once a year[^72]. As the facts showed, it took less than one year before stolen property was received in the bank account. In the first place, as Prosecution pointed out, the Accused would not be able to be alerted to any suspicious activity taking place in the bank account of the company if he did not even open the bank letters at any one point[^73];

> (c)     The Accused simply collected the bank documents from Kelvin Mun and forwarded it overseas, without paying attention to the persons to whom he was forwarding them to[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74) or the addresses at which he was asked to send them to[^75]. These bank documents included critical banking instruments like cheque books and bank tokens. I agreed with the Prosecution that on the evidence, the Accused acted as a “_mere post-box_” who forwarded important banking documents to unknown persons based overseas without conducting checks and enquiries[^76].

40     From the foregoing, it was clear that no effort or action was taken by the Accused to supervise the affairs of the Companies.

### Action Taken By The Accused After Investigations Began Did Not Amount To Supervision

41     Defence submitted that the Accused exercised supervision over the Companies after the “_first red flag_” i.e. when the Accused was contacted by CAO Ruiyun, by doing the following[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77):-

> (a)     Brought corporate secretarial files of the Companies to his interview with CAO Ruiyun;

> (b)     Went out of his way to procure information and documents relating to the Companies and volunteered them for the investigation, even going through bank statements;

> (c)     Made copies of/furnished all bank correspondence which he received from Kelvin Mun;

> (d)     Sought directions and guidance from CAO Ruiyun on the steps he should take in relation to the Companies; and

> (e)     Ensured that the Companies were still compliant with IRAS and ACRA, updating the investigators as he did so.

42     In my view, the steps taken above by the Accused did not amount to supervision of the Companies’ affairs. They were taken only in response to CAD investigations and were intended to assist in and to facilitate CAD investigations. The Accused could not be described as monitoring or managing or even watching the affairs of the Companies as he took the above steps in co-operating with CAD.

43     On the evidence, I found that the Accused had failed to exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies. None of the acts done by the Accused amounted to supervision by him over the Companies.

## The Standard Of Reasonable Diligence Expected Of The Accused

44     Even when the Accused had failed to exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies, the next question to be determined was the standard of reasonable diligence expected of the Accused. The standard of reasonable diligence to be expected of the Accused would determine if the Accused had indeed fallen short of the standards expected of him when he failed to exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies.

45     As stated in the case of _Abdul Ghani Bin Tahir_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1153</span> (“_Abdul Ghani_”) at \[85\]:

> _“\[T\]he standard of care expected of a director is of the “same degree of care and diligence as a reasonable director found in his position”….However, the standard is “not fixed but a continuum” depending on various factors such as the individual’s role in the company, the experience or skills that the director held himself out to possess in support of his appointment to the office, and the size and business of the company.”_

46      _Abdul Ghani_ was instructive. I drew from it these following principles which were applicable to the Accused in this case:-

> (a)     The Accused is expected to exercise “_the same degree of care and diligence as a reasonable director found in his position_” would[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78);

> (b)     The Accused, even though a nominee director or a local resident director, cannot be a “_dummy director_” who approves, ignores or is nonchalant as to whether a company is engaged in illegal activities as this would make a mockery of the statutory requirement[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79);

> (c)     The Accused’s inaction on the basis that the provision of such resident director services is a common practice in Singapore or the fact that most resident directors conduct themselves in a similar fashion as he did, would not exculpate him from wrongdoing if there was in fact a breach of his duty to exercise reasonable diligence[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80).

### An Objective Standard

47     The standard of reasonable diligence expected of the Accused was an objective one. As mentioned, it would be that of the same degree of care and diligence as a reasonable director found in his position. However, that did not mean that the common practices amongst nominee directors (who would be in the same position as the Accused) at the material time would form the objective standard against which the Accused’s actions should be measured against. On the contrary, the objective standard expected of nominee directors at the material time would set the benchmark against which the conduct of the Accused (and other directors in his position) would be measured against. As the Court in _Abdul Ghani_ recognized, even if most local resident directors conducted themselves in similar fashion i.e. acted in a “_nonchalant and cavalier fashion_” in the face of obvious red flags, this common practice did not and could not exculpate the offender in _Abdul Ghani_.

### The Standard of Reasonable Diligence of a Nominee Director

#### A Nominee Director Is As Good As A Director

48     Section 157(1) of the Companies Act states: “_A director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office_”. The law does not make a distinction between nominee directors and executive directors.

49     As the court in _Public Prosecutor v Abdul Ghani bin Tahir_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 161</span> observed:

> “\[_c\]ase law has unequivocally pronounced that there was no difference in the standard of care and diligence required of nominee directors and other directors. It was also settled law that every director owed the same responsibility to the company as a whole, and there was no difference where a director was the nominee of a group of shareholders or creditors: see  W & P Piling Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Chew_ Yin _What and others  <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 218</span> and also Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another v Justlogin Pte Ltd and another  <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 675</span>.”_

50     The Accused himself was well-aware that a nominee director was “_as good as a director”_, adding that “_the only difference is that we do not run the business for their companies_”. He went further as he affirmed that _“\[b\]y law, there is no position of nominee director; nominee director is still the director_”[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81). As pointed out by the Prosecution, the Accused admitted that a director is required to inform himself about the affairs and understand the business of the company and is under a continuing obligation to do so[^82].

51     The absence of guidelines for nominee directors in clear and written form at the material time did not mean that standards of reasonable diligence expected of a nominee director did not exist. The absence of guidelines may be a matter affecting the level of culpability of the Accused but did not absolve him of the requirement of exercising reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties. Hence, a standard of reasonable diligence is expected of the Accused in the discharge of his duties as director, even under the label of “nominee director”.

52     Even if the Accused was only a director having no part in the executive decisions of the company or any say in how the company was run, as a director, the Accused must be expected to perform some basic duties as a director –be it enquiring into the Companies’ business activities, the identity of foreign directors or taking some form of care and involvement in supervising the affairs of the company by checking bank statements et cetera. It would be unacceptable that he or she may hide behind the label of “nominee director” or as a local resident director (just to fulfil the requirements of the law for companies whose directors are not ordinarily resident in Singapore) to justify a complete lack of oversight or supervision over the company in which he has stepped up to be a director of.

#### No Need For Red Flags

53     Much has been said by the Accused about the absence of “_red flags_”[\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83) and how the Companies were “_low-risk_” [^84]. Defence argued that _Abdul Ghani_ “_establishes that a director would be found to have failed to exercise “any supervision” (in the context of Section 157 of the Companies Act) if he failed to make proper inquiries in the presence of obvious red flags or circumstances that called for him to make inquiries based on his knowledge of suspicious facts known to him_”[^85]. Whilst it is accurate that the Court in _Abdul Ghani_ had found that there were surrounding circumstances which ought to have put the offender on inquiry that illicit activities were being carried out through the company of which he was a nominee director of, (i.e. “_red flags_”), and that the offender ought to have stepped up his supervision over the company’s activities, the Court did not go so far as to say that a director would only be in breach of his duties under the Companies Act if he had not acted in the presence of “_red flags_”.

54     This understanding of the case of _Abdul Ghani_ that no “_red flags_” are necessary would be consistent with a plain reading of section 157(1) of the Companies Act. There need not be any “_red flags_” before the duties of a director are triggered. Under the law, a director must act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties as director at all times[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86), not only in the presence of “_red flags_”. It was not up to the Accused to decide when he should use reasonable diligence as a director and when he need not. Even if there were no “_red flags_” and the Companies were “_low-risk_” (given the nationalities of the foreign directors and/or the fact that Kelvin Mun had previously been the nominee director of the Companies and/or that bank accounts had been opened), the Accused was obliged to be active and to take steps in supervising the affairs of the Companies as a director of the Companies.

#### Standard Of Reasonable Diligence Involved Basic Duties Of A Director

55     The measure of diligence required of a director under the law is a reasonable one. However, on the evidence in this case, I could not find any effort on the part of the Accused in supervising the Companies. As pointed out by the Prosecution, after being appointed as a director by the Companies and prior to being aware of CAD’s investigations, the Accused failed to conduct background checks into the Companies’ foreign directors and its business operations and activities. He did not know who the foreign directors were, did not know what the foreign directors were doing with the Companies, did not know what were the Companies’ business activities. The Accused had also allowed himself to be put in a position where he had no control over the Companies’ banking activities by forwarding banking PIN, tokens and cheque books to unknown individuals based overseas, without further verification and simply on “Florina’s” instructions[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87). These were basic duties of a director which the Accused failed to discharge. In essence, there was lacking an expression of reasonable diligence on the part of the Accused as a director of the Companies.

56     Moreover, the Accused was a director with skill and experience[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88):

> (a)     At the material time, he was (and still is) the managing director of 3E, an accounting firm which provides, amongst other services, accounting services, corporate secretarial services and nominee director services to a large number of companies[\[note: 89\]](#Ftn_89);

> (b)     He was appointed as a director in numerous companies[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90);

> (c)     The Accused was (and still is) a member of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants since March 2010 and is a chartered accountant of both Singapore and Malaysia[\[note: 91\]](#Ftn_91); and

> (d)     He had attended certified public accountant courses on money laundering and bankruptcy cases involving nominee directors[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92).

57     As observed in _Abdul Ghani_ at \[86\]:

> _“the skills and experience held out by the Appellant as a chartered accountant and a veteran local resident director could not be ignored in determining the standard of reasonable diligence expected of a director under s 157(1) of the CA”._

58     In this case, given the skill and experience possessed by the Accused, more was expected of the Accused in his role as a nominee director of the Companies. Still, the Accused failed to exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies and has thus breached the standard expected of him.

### Determination Of “Reasonable Diligence” Is A Question For The Court

59     Part of the Defence’s case involved the evidence of DW2 Dr Ramasamy Subramaniam Iyer (“Dr Iyer”). Dr Iyer was called as an expert; his report[\[note: 93\]](#Ftn_93) and testimony in court was based on his experience dealing with corporate affairs; that he had been a director before and had also been dealing with director affairs for a long time, even before the material time[^94]. The Defence took the view that Dr Iyer would be able to opine on the standards and the acts that were in operation at the material time in respect of reasonable diligence.

60     Essentially, Dr Iyer concluded that the extent of diligence performed by the Accused was “_reasonable, and justified in the circumstances_”[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95). As summarised by the Prosecution[^96], Dr Iyer’s conclusion was based on the following:

> (a)     The Accused acted reasonably in relying on “_DBS’s clearance of Know-Your-Client, due diligence, and ongoing fraud monitoring system_” in relation to the bank accounts opened for the Companies[\[note: 97\]](#Ftn_97);

> (b)     Kelvin Mun had chosen to “_pass the problem_” to the Accused, exhibiting a “_lack of ethics_” and was “_not wholly truthful_”[\[note: 98\]](#Ftn_98);

> (c)     The heightened due diligence expectations, especially in relation to anti-money laundering and terrorism financing, were not yet in place at the time of the offences[\[note: 99\]](#Ftn_99);

> (d)     Even if the heightened checks were in place, a provider of nominee director services would not be able to spot a potential criminal through a cursory look at the bank statements[\[note: 100\]](#Ftn_100).

61     Whilst I allowed Dr Iyer to be called as an expert witness in order to fully appreciate the precise nature and complete scope of his expert testimony, in the end, I was not able to accept his evidence. First and importantly, in my view, what amounted to “reasonable diligence” and whether the Accused’s conduct had breached the standard of reasonable diligence were key legal issues for the Court to decide, based on the totality of evidence adduced in trial, not on an expert’s opinion.

62     Second, even if there was value in DW2’s evidence on the basis that it pertained to the prevailing standards of a nominee director in the Accused’s position at the material time and whether the Accused had met those standards, I was not prepared to place weight on his report or his evidence in court. I agreed with Prosecution[\[note: 101\]](#Ftn_101) that:

> (a)     Dr Iyer was not qualified to give his opinion on legal issues; he was not legally trained or familiar with the law in the area. It was clear that Dr Iyer’s opinion was based on his experience as a director, rather than an understanding of the law[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102);

> (b)     Dr Iyer’s opinion were derived from his personal observations of how business was conducted at the material time[\[note: 103\]](#Ftn_103); it was not based on any legal experience or even objective standards. Further, Dr Iyer was never a nominee director himself[^104], was never in the business of providing secretarial services at the relevant periods of time[^105] and did not have personal interaction with nominee directors[^106]; and

> (c)     Dr Iyer’s work experience show him up as an expert in the accounting industry, as could be seen in his curriculum vitae[\[note: 107\]](#Ftn_107), and do not directly relate to the issues at hand.

63     Having considered his evidence, I did not find Dr Iyer to be in a good position to comment on the standards expected of nominee directors at the material time and whether what the Accused had sufficiently discharged his duty as a director of the Companies. Dr Iyer’s conclusion that the Accused’s actions were “_reasonable and justified_” because of the Accused’s reliance on checks done by the bank and Kelvin Mun as well as the absence of clear guidelines for nominee directors at the material time had already been considered insufficient to absolve the Accused from his duty as a director to conduct his own independent checks as director of the Companies. Such reliance also did not amount to acts of supervision.

64     As for Dr Iyer’s point that a cursory review of the bank statements of the Companies would not raise any “_red flags_” that would require follow-up by a nominee director, this was a non-starter since the Accused himself admitted that he did not even open any bank statements of the Companies. This was not a case where the Accused had opened bank statements, viewed them but did not do more to notice any suspicious or fraudulent transactions.

65     For these reasons, I did not deem it appropriate to place any weight on Dr Iyer’s report or testimony in court as to whether the Accused’s actions as nominee director of the Companies were reasonable and whether he had sufficiently discharged his duty.

## The Accused’s Failure To Exercise Any Supervision Over The Affairs Of The Companies Resulted In The Companies Dealing With Stolen Property

66     Defence argued that there was no causation between the Accused’s actions and/or omissions that resulted in the Companies dealing with “stolen property”. The complaint was that the Prosecution had neither explained nor established how the Companies dealing with stolen properties could have been avoided by the Accused’s exercise of reasonable diligence or acts of supervision[\[note: 108\]](#Ftn_108), adding that the responsibility of ensuring that stolen monies were not laundered rested on other entities such as the banks themselves and the law enforcement agencies[^109].

67     In choosing to prefer a charge which states that the Accused’s failure to exercise reasonable diligence as a director of the Companies had _resulted in_ the Companies dealing with stolen property, the Prosecution’s position was that any degree of causation would be sufficient to establish the charges. The Accused’s failure did not have to be “wholly” or “mainly” causing the Companies to deal in stolen property[\[note: 110\]](#Ftn_110). I accepted the Prosecution’s position.

68     In the case of _Abdul Ghani_, the Court in considering the meaning of the word “_attributable_” in the context of section 59(1)(b) of the CDSA, held at \[76\], that:

> _“any degree of attribution will be sufficient to make out the charge. What matters is whether the officer could and should have taken steps to prevent the offence; not whether any steps if taken by the officer will more likely than not or most definitely have prevented the commission of the offence. In my view, this interpretation is in line with Parliament’s intent of holding officers criminally liable for the actions of corporate bodies that they manage or control.”_

69     Drawing guidance from _Abdul Ghani_, I was of the view that similar reasoning may be applied to the failure of the Accused in exercising reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as nominee director which led to the situation the Companies found themselves in. In my view, the Prosecution was not obliged to prove that it was because of the Accused’s lack of supervision over the affairs of the Companies that directly led to each of the companies dealing in stolen property. So long as the Prosecution could show that there was a causal link i.e. if the Accused had exercised supervision over the Companies as he should have done, the Companies may not have dealt with stolen property. It did not matter what the other entities (banks or law enforcement agencies or even Kelvin Mun) could and/or should have done or the roles they played, but rather, what the Accused could and should have done in his role as director of the Companies which could have prevented the Companies from dealing with stolen property.

70     As submitted by the Prosecution, if the Accused had taken the basic steps of exercising the requisite supervision in the Companies’ affairs (whether prior to or upon becoming a director of the Companies), including conducting his own background checks on the foreign directors and their roles in the Companies, understanding the nature of the Companies’ affairs and business through requesting documents, reviewing bank statements, it was possible that the Companies may not have received stolen property. Instead, the Accused left the Companies’ affairs unchecked and unmonitored. His failure to exercise any supervision over the Companies’ affairs resulted in their bank accounts being used to receive fraudulent funds from various sources[\[note: 111\]](#Ftn_111).

## Conclusion of trial

71     Upon consideration of the totality of evidence in this case, I was satisfied that the elements of the charges had been made out against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The Accused had failed to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as director of the Companies, when he failed to exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies, resulting in the Companies dealing in stolen property. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on all four charges.

## Prescribed Punishment

72     An offence under section 157(1) of the Companies Act is punishable under section 157(3)(b) of the Act which provides for a fine up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months. Under section 154(2)(b) of the Companies Act, the Court may also make an order of disqualification, disqualifying the Accused from acting as a director for a period of five years.

73     Prosecution sought a custodial sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment on each charge, with the sentences in two charges to run consecutively, as well as a disqualification order of five years, making it a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification of five years. Defence, on the other hand, submitted for a fine of $5,000 on each of the charges, making it a total of $20,000.

## When The Custodial Threshold Is Crossed

74     In respect of sentence, I continued to be guided by _Abdul Ghani_. As _Abdul Ghani_ was the first reported case where a director had been imprisoned on account of a breach of the duty to exercise reasonable diligence under section 157(a) of the Companies Act, the Court deeply considered the issue of when custodial sentences should be imposed for such breaches[\[note: 112\]](#Ftn_112). After considering the legislative intent of section 157(1) of the Companies Act and the submissions of the _amicus curiae_, the Court held at \[166\] that:

> “…_the starting point for purely negligent breaches of the duty to exercise reasonable diligence is a fine (where there are no weighty aggravating factors) with custodial sentences being imposed where the director breaches this duty intentionally, knowingly or recklessly_”.

75     The holding above was enunciated in the context of the Court’s consideration in relation to the offence under section 157(1) of the Companies Act. Just as the key question for the Court in _Abdul Ghani_ in sentence was whether the Appellant breached his duties of reasonable diligence intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or merely negligently[\[note: 113\]](#Ftn_113), the key question which remained in this case was whether the Accused had breached his duties of reasonable diligence negligently or had he done so recklessly?

## Reasons for the Sentence

### Accused was Reckless

76     On the evidence, I found that there was a degree of recklessness with which the Accused had approached his directorship of the Companies. The Accused was well-aware of the risks of being a nominee director and he knew that a nominee director was “_as good as a director_”. It was also clear that the Accused was eager to expand the business of 3E Accounting; he was willing to take up the risk and take over the nominee directorships of the Companies from Kelvin Mun/MW. In his eagerness:

> (a)     The Accused assumed that checks were done by Kelvin Mun/MW and chose to rely on those checks even though he did not know or verify what checks were in fact done by Kelvin Mun/MW; and

> (b)     The Accused chose to rely on checks done by the bank. He knew that bank accounts were open and assumed that the banks, having the necessary resources, must have done their checks and considered these companies to be safe.

77     In his eagerness to expand his business, as mentioned, the Accused also to carry out personal and/or independent checks on the Companies or their affairs. He did not take steps to verify the exact identity of the person he was corresponding with on email when he was first contacted to provide director services despite the fact that different persons appeared to write from the same email address. He also did not review any documents, did not know the business or purpose of incorporation of the companies, who the other directors were or the roles they played, right until the time he was called up for investigations by CAD. The Accused failed to check any bank letters or statements before forwarding them to a foreign address which was not the address of any of the authorized signatories of the Companies’ bank accounts.

78     As recognized by the Court in _Abdul Ghani_, the single offence under section 157(1) of the Companies Act may have a composite _mens rea_ of both negligence and recklessness, which would then require an analysis of the predominant _mens rea_[\[note: 114\]](#Ftn_114). Turning to the facts of this case, I found that even if certain acts of the Accused as director may be considered negligent, there were key aspects of his conduct where he had clearly been reckless which resulted in the Companies dealing in stolen property.

79     This was particularly in respect of the Accused’s failure to exercise any supervision when he failed to personally check any bank documents and devices relating to the Companies. The Accused acted merely as a post-box, forwarding important banking documents, which included bank letters and statements, cheque books and tokens, to unknown persons based overseas without conducting checks and enquiries[\[note: 115\]](#Ftn_115). As highlighted by the Prosecution, there were circumstances which the Accused failed to pay attention to despite the obvious risks involved[^116]:

> (a)     The Accused did not verify why he was instructed to forward the relevant documents to an address in Beirut, which was not the address of any of the authorised signatories of the Companies’ bank accounts[\[note: 117\]](#Ftn_117);

> (b)     The Accused did not verify with Florina on the identities of the intended recipients or their roles in the Companies (i.e. “Rosemary Khalil”[\[note: 118\]](#Ftn_118) and “Khalil”[^119]), nor did he enquire why he was instructed to forward the relevant documents to parties who were not authorised signatories of the Companies’ bank accounts[^120];

> (c)     In respect of “Florina’s” requests to courier the bank tokens, the Accused did not enquire why Florina had on separate occasions provided two different recipients (i.e. “Ihab Khalil” and “Khalil”) and two different addresses in Beirut, Lebanon, when none of the foreign directors resided in Lebanon[\[note: 121\]](#Ftn_121);

> (d)     The Accused did not enquire why the person to whom Kelvin Mun forwarded the bank PINs to (i.e. “Mr. Iho”) was different from the intended recipient of the token as stated in the email dated 15 November 2012 at 11.36 am at Exhibit D2435 (i.e. “Ihab Khalil”)[\[note: 122\]](#Ftn_122); and

> (e)     The Accused also did not enquire why Kelvin Mun forwarded the bank PINs to Mr. Iho when he understood the intended recipient of the bank PINs to be “Florina”[\[note: 123\]](#Ftn_123).

80     On the evidence, I found that the Accused had breached his duties as a director of the Companies recklessly when he failed to exercise supervision over the affairs of the Companies in these areas. He surrendered critical banking documents, bank tokens and bank PINs to persons overseas whose addresses were dubious, whose identities he did not even bother to enquire, much less check. This gave opportunity to perpetrators of fraud to carry out their illegal activities, as the facts had shown.

81     Whilst there may be general risks involved with taking on the directorship of any company, it is the level of consciousness of the risks involved in the mind of a director which go some way in determining if his or her conduct was merely negligent or reckless. There was clearly such consciousness on the part of the Accused based on his own admissions but the level of the Accused’s consciousness was more acute in light of his training, expertise and experience. The Accused’s culpability arose from his inaction despite knowledge; his failure to exercise any supervision over the affairs of the Companies despite an awareness that there were risks involved with being a nominee director of a foreign company, particularly in circumstances described above.

82     Given the facts, I was satisfied that a custodial term was warranted and a fine would not be the appropriate punishment in this case.

### The Appropriate Length Of The Custodial Term

83     Defence submitted that the majority of sentencing precedents involving Corporate Service Providers (CSPs) did not impose a custodial sentence[\[note: 124\]](#Ftn_124). In all seven cases cited, fines were imposed and a disqualification of 12 months to three years was imposed.

84     The first observation I made was that these precedent cases were unreported cases. Whilst they gave a good flavour of the type of sentence which had been imposed in respect of offences under section 157(1) of the Companies Act, they were of limited assistance since they were unreasoned. There was no understanding as to how these cases had considered _Abdul Ghani_, if at all, in sentencing. I was unable to place weight on these cases. In my mind, _Abdul Ghani_ was clear in when the custodial threshold had been crossed in respect of an offence under section 157(1) of the Companies Act. As explained, an imposition of a fine on the facts present in the Accused’s case would not be an appropriate sentence.

85     In submitting for a custodial term of six weeks on each charge, Prosecution submitted that the Accused was more culpable than the offender in _Abdul Ghani__[\[note: 125\]](#Ftn_125)_ and the offender in the unreported case of _Public Prosecutor v Jasbir Kaur_ (SC 903462-2021) (“Jasbir Kaur”)[^126]. Similarly, I was not prepared to place weight on _Jasbir Kaur_ as this was an unreported decision. As for the other reported cases involving offences section 157 Companies Act, I found them to be distinguishable on the facts.

86     Preferring to take my guidance from _Abdul Ghani_, I was of the view that the Accused’s culpability was lower than the offender in _Abdul Ghani_. The offender in _Abdul Ghani_ consented to be WEL’s director without meeting or speaking with the foreign director and he had a hand in personally opening the bank account for WEL, more importantly, the offender in _Abdul Ghani_ had received recall notices for transactions which took place in WEL’s account, with one notice making specific reference to a fraudulent transaction. An individual even called up the offender in _Abdul Ghani_ in relation to one of these transactions and asked for a return of the money[\[note: 127\]](#Ftn_127). These surrounding circumstances ought to have put the offender in _Abdul Ghani_ on inquiry that illicit activities were being carried out through WEL, such that the offender ought to have stepped up his supervision over WEL’s activities. Yet, the offender in _Abdul Ghani_ did not take any appropriate action such as contacting the bank or alerting the authorities to freeze the account. He was sentenced to four weeks imprisonment on the charge under section 157(1) of the Companies Act. Circumstances such as those found in _Abdul Ghani_ were not present in this current case.

87     Bearing in mind the fact that the Accused was a first offender and the other mitigating factors raised by Defence in their submissions[\[note: 128\]](#Ftn_128), I was of the view that a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment on each charge would be an adequate sentence.

### An Order Of Disqualification

88     In addition, I imposed a disqualification order of five years on the Accused under section 154(2)(b) read with section 154(4)(b) of the Companies Act.

89     The need for disqualification under the Companies Act was discussed in the case of _Ong Chow Hong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1093</span> (“_Ong Chow Hong_”). As stated at \[20\]:

> _“An analysis of the statutory structure fortifies the view that our disqualification regime is predominantly protective in nature … The statutory policy therefore appears to be that disqualification orders ought to be generally imposed to protect the public from individuals who are shown to be unworthy of being privileged with the protective shield of corporate autonomy. In other words, the disqualification regime serves to protect the public from abuses of the limited liability privilege.”_

90     Apart from being primarily protective in nature, a disqualification order has the effect of deterrence. At \[24\] of _Ong Chow Hong_, the court added_:_ “_This form of protection of the public is expressed through the appropriate calibration of disqualification orders assessed to be sufficient to deter serious lapses in corporate behaviour_”. This was similarly echoed in _Abdul Ghani_ at \[164\].

91     In light of the Accused’s failure to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as director of the Companies by a complete lack of supervision over their affairs, I was satisfied that a disqualification was warranted.

## Conclusion

92     The total sentence imposed was: six weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification of five years. The imprisonment term, coupled with a lengthy disqualification on the Accused was an appropriate sentence for the Accused on the facts of the case.

93     Pending the hearing of this appeal, a stay of execution has been granted on the imprisonment term as well as the disqualification order. Accused is currently on bail of $10,000.
