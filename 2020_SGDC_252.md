Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

Road Traffic – Offences – Driving without reasonable consideration causing death

2 November 2020 - Judgment reserved

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       This was the first tragic fatal road traffic accident which occurred after the amendments to the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”) came into force on 1 November 2019. The accused, a 27-year-old male Indian National, was charged with driving his lorry without reasonable consideration (commonly referred to as “inconsiderate driving”) causing death under s 65(1)(b) and punishable under s 65(2)(a) read with s 65(6)(a) of the RTA for an accident involving a cyclist.

2       On 10 November 2019 at about 7.39am, the accused was driving his lorry bearing vehicle no. YP264A (“the accused’s lorry”) out of Changi Beach Carpark 4 (“carpark”). The lorry is a Class 4 vehicle with an unladen weight of about 6240kg.

3       Whilst executing a right turn out of the said carpark onto Nicoll Drive towards Telok Paku Road, the bicycle of 55-year-old Mark Anthony Kirk Doney (“the deceased”), who was riding it along Nicoll Drive towards Changi Coast Road, collided with the right side of the accused’s lorry. The collision resulted in the deceased’s death.

4       On 4 September 2020, the accused pleaded guilty before me to the singular inconsiderate driving charge. The accused informed me that prior to the accident, he was a foreign worker working in Singapore as a lorry driver. Since the accident, he lost his job and all his driving licences (Class 2B, 3 and 4) were also suspended by the Traffic Police. He was sorry for committing the offence and would like to serve sentence and return to India to be with his family as soon as possible.

5       As the accused had no means to engage a counsel and as this is the first case where an accused will be sentenced under the new s 65(2)(a) of the RTA for causing death due to inconsiderate driving, I referred his case to the CLAS ad hoc pro bono scheme. I was also mindful of the accused’s wish to be remanded on 4 September 2020 pending sentence being imposed on him.

6       As such, I am thankful to defence counsel for agreeing to take up the accused’s case pro bono on 7 September 2020 for the purpose of mitigation and submission on sentence. Defence counsel requested for some time to prepare written mitigation plea and sentencing submissions.

7       On 9 October 2020, I heard both the Prosecution and Defence on their submissions on sentence and the accused’s mitigation plea. I adjourned the case to today to deliver this judgment as well as my reasons in coming to my decision on sentence.

## Background Facts

### The Charge

8       The inconsiderate driving charge reads as follows:

> You, are charged that you on 10 November 2019, at about 7.39 am, along Nicoll Drive towards Changi Coast Road, Singapore, did drive a motor lorry, bearing registration number YP 264A, without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road when making a right turn from Changi Beach Carpark 4 off Nicoll Drive onto Nicoll Drive, _to wit_, by failing to give way to Mark Anthony Kirk Doney, who was riding a bicycle along Nicoll Drive, and had the right of way and this resulted in the bicycle colliding into the right of your motor lorry, thus causing the death of Mark Anthony Kirk Doney, you have thereby committed an offence under s 65(1)(b), punishable under Section 65(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).

### Statement of facts

9       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 4 September 2020 without qualification. A concise, succinct and edited version of both the SOF depicting the offence of the inconsiderate driving charge reads as follows:

> …

> **THE ACCIDENT**

> 4.    On 10 November 2019, at about 7.39 am, the deceased was travelling along Nicoll Drive (towards Changi Coast Road). The witness was travelling about 40 to 50 metres behind the deceased at the material time. The witness observed that the deceased was travelling at about 30 km/h to 34 km/h and was not going particularly fast.

> 5.    The accused turned out of Changi Beach Carpark 4 located off Nicoll Drive and was turning right onto Nicoll Drive (towards Telok Paku Road). The accused admits that he did not stop at the stop line before making the right turn onto Nicoll Drive. This is captured on the footage from the accused’s in-vehicle camera. The accused saw the deceased travelling between lane 1 and lane 2 when the deceased was about 200 metres away. The accused executed the right turn, stopping in the middle of the 2-lane road just in time to avoid a collision with a motorcyclist who was travelling in the same direction as the deceased. The accused admits that he did not see the motorcyclist until the last moment. After the motorcycle had passed, the accused continued with his right turn despite seeing the deceased coming towards him quickly with his head down. The accused even horned to provide a warning to the deceased, expecting the deceased to stop to allow the accused to complete his right turn.

> 6.    The witness noted that the accused had initially stopped and therefore he expected the accused to give way to the deceased. However, when the deceased was about 5 metres from the carpark exit, the accused continued with the right turn, and the deceased did not have enough time to brake and avoid a collision. The deceased collided directly onto the right side of the motor lorry together with his bicycle.

> 7.    The accused failed to give way to the deceased whilst he was executing the right turn despite the deceased having the right of way.

> 8.    Other cyclists who were in the area stopped to render aid.

> 9.    At the material time, the traffic volume was light, the road surface was dry, the weather was fine, and visibility was clear.

> **INJURIES SUSTAINED BY THE DECEASED**

> 10.    Dr Peng Wuxuan prepared a Medical Report dated 17 December 2019 (“**Dr Peng’s Medical Report**”). According to Dr Peng’s Medical Report, the deceased was unresponsive and had no pulse at the scene of the accident due to the collision. The deceased was in cardiac arrest and in asystole. He was given 8 minutes of CPR and one dose of adrenaline. Once the deceased achieved return of spontaneous circulation, he was transported to Changi General Hospital (“**CGH**”).

> 11.    According to Dr Peng’s Medical Report, the deceased sustained the following injuries:

>> a.    A high cervical cord injury – fracture of odontoid peg with intraparenchymal haematoma in the spinal cord at C2, with surrounding oedema and cord swelling, and disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament.

>> b.    Bilateral nasal bone fractures.

>> c.    A C5 fracture with small paravertebral hematoma extending from C4-5.

>> d.    A T6 compression fracture.

>> e.    A right clavicular fracture.

> The aforementioned injuries are consistent with that of a road traffic accident.

> 12.    On 14 November 2019, the deceased succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead by at 4.34 pm.

> 13.    On 15 November 2019, an autopsy was conducted by Dr Lee Chin Thye. The Autopsy Report dated 18 November 2019 confirms that the cause of death are the cervical spine and brainstem injuries.

> **HSA REPORTS**

> 14.    On 15 November 2019, one Ravi Subramaniyan submitted three samples – peripheral blood (oxalated), peripheral blood (plain) and urine – sealed “HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY” and marked “MARK ANTHONY KIRK DONEY”, for toxicology analysis. Following the analysis, Nadia Norashikin Bti A S Wong, issued a Toxicology Report dated 26 November 2019, setting out the results of the toxicology analysis of the deceased’s blood and urine samples.

>> a.    On analysis of the deceased’s blood sample, 7-aminoclonazepam, levitiracetam at and metoclopramide were detected.

>> b.    On analysis of the deceased’s urine sample, 7-aminoclonazepam, hydroxymidazolam, levitiracetam, lignocaine and metoclopramide were detected.

> 15.    According to the Clarificatory Medical Report dated 17 August 2020, all 5 drugs were administered during the deceased’s stay in hospital. According to Clarificatory Toxicology Report dated 18 May 2020, the presence of 7-aminoclonazepam, leviracetam and metoclopramide would not have had any bearing on the cause of death. Similarly, the Clarificatory Toxicology Report dated 20 August 2020 clarifies that hydroxymidazolam and lignocaine would not have had any bearing on the cause of death.

> **MECHANICAL INSPECTION REPORTS**

> 16.    An inspection report in relation to the bicycle dated 1 April 2020 was issued by LKK Auto Consultant Pte Ltd. The report concludes as follows:

>> a.    The steering system and braking system of the bicycle were in serviceable condition.

>> b.    There was no evidence that a mechanical failure to the bicycle caused the accident.

>> c.    The 2 tyres of the bicycle were in serviceable condition. There were no tears, cuts or burst marks on the outer and inner sidewalls as well as across the tread of the 2 tyres.

> 17.    An inspection report in relation to the motor lorry dated 30 March 2020 was issued by LKK Auto Consultant Pte Ltd. The report concludes as follows:

>> a.    The engine system, steering system, braking system, and transmission system were all in serviceable condition.

>> b.    There was no evidence that a mechanical failure to the motor lorry caused the accident.

>> c.    The 6 tyres of the motor lorry were in serviceable condition. There were no tears, cuts or burst marks on the outer and inner sidewalls as well as across the tread of the motor lorry.

12     The left arm rest and right handlebar of the deceased’s bicycle were twisted.

### Antecedents

13     The Prosecution submitted that the accused has nothing similar on the basis that he did not have any compounded traffic offences on or after 1 Nov 2019.

14     Even though s 139AA of the RTA states that the court may take into account any offences that has been compounded under this Act (whether before, on or after the date of commencement) of the amendments made to the RTA on 1 November 2019 for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence, the Prosecution urged the court not to do so.

15     The Prosecution reassured me that in coming to its submission on the appropriate sentence and in fairness to the accused, it has not taken into account and will not be submitting on any of the accused’s compounded traffic offences prior to the legislative amendments of the RTA on 1 November 2019.

16     Defence counsel did not have any objections to this position as it is favourable to the accused.

17     As both parties are in general agreement with this position and it is favourable to the accused, I agreed with parties not to consider any compounded traffic offences committed by the accused prior to 1 November 2019 when coming to my decision on sentence.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

18     The Prosecution tendered two sets of written submissions on the sentencing position sought by them.

19     It is seeking a sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment and the accused be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“DQAC”) for a period of 8 years with effect from date of release from prison.

20     The 8 years’ DQAC is the mandatory minimum period of disqualification statutorily required to be imposed pursuant to s65(6)(a) of the RTA.

#### Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework for s 65(2)(a) of the RTA

21     As this is the first case of inconsiderate driving causing death to be decided by any court, in the absence of any sentencing precedents, the Prosecution has proposed a sentencing framework for the court’s consideration. The purpose is not only to foster consistency and predictability in sentencing practice for this offence but also to ensure that the message of deterrence is adequately reflected in the sentencing ranges provided.

22     In coming up with the proposed sentencing framework, the Prosecution urged this court not to consider sentencing precedents from:

> (a)      S 65 of the pre-1 November 2019 RTA amendments as the old provision did not distinguish the different levels of harm caused from inconsiderate or careless driving like hurt, grievous hurt and death. As such, the prescribed punishment then was only a fine not exceeding $1,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 6 months or both; and

> (b)      S 304A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”), which was previously being used to prosecute offenders for causing death due to negligent or rash driving pre-1 November 2019 RTA amendments.

23     In relation to the s 304A of the PC, Prosecution stated two reasons. First, the maximum prescribed punishment for this provision under the negligent limb (or s 304A(b)) was only an imprisonment term of up to 2 years or with fine or both. Sentences for road traffic cases under s 304A(b) of the PC were further depressed because the provision was not solely reserved for road traffic offences. Conversely, the new s 65(2)(a) of the RTA carries a higher maximum prescribed punishment of $10,000 fine or with imprisonment up to 3 years or with both.

24     As such, previous High Court decisions like _PP v Hue An Li_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span> (“_Hue An Li”_), which held that the starting point for road traffic cases under s 304A(b) of the PC is a period of imprisonment term of four weeks, is no longer applicable or relevant when determining the appropriate sentence to impose under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA.

25     Second, when Parliament enacted the new amendments to the RTA, it could be seen from the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill No. 13/2019 (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (8 July 2019) vol. 94) presented by Mrs Josephine Teo, the Second Minister for Home Affairs (“Second Reading of RT (A) Bill”), that it was Parliament’s intention to:

> (a)     Consolidate all driving offences under the RTA instead of prosecuting separately under the RTA or the PC; and

> (b)     Increase the sentencing norms for egregious and irresponsible driving offences, particularly those that result in death or some form of permanent disabilities.

26     For the reasons stated above, the Prosecution submitted a proposed sentencing framework for offenders convicted under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA after trial as follows:

27     In coming up with the proposed sentencing framework, the Prosecution only considered the degree of culpability of the accused as the level of harm caused has very limited scope for consideration since the eventuality of the harm caused is death.

28     In terms of assessing an accused’s culpability for the accident under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA, the Prosecution said that the appropriate starting point within these indicative sentencing ranges will be a fact-sensitive inquiry regarding the accused’s level of culpability. This is based on the following two main considerations:

> (a)     The degree of carelessness; and

> (b)     The circumstances and causes of the careless driving referred to as “culpability-enhancing factors”.

29     The Prosecution elaborated that the degree of careless driving can be assessed from the perspective of whether any of the following factors listed below, which require the accused to exercise a greater level of care and attention, are present on the facts:

> (a)     Nature of the road (e.g. whether it was an expressway, main road or small lane);

> (b)     Condition and use of the road (e.g. whether it was a busy traffic junction, main road near a school or a deserted side road);

> (c)     Volume of traffic or number of pedestrians actually on or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road at the relevant time;

> (d)     Visibility at the relevant time; and

> (e)     The type of vehicle (e.g. whether the accused was driving a heavy vehicle or not).

30     The Prosecution gave an example how these factors may interplay: where an accused fails to keep a proper lookout for oncoming traffic while making a discretionary right turn at a junction, his culpability will be higher if he is driving a heavy vehicle and the junction is busy as compared to riding a motorcycle and the junction is not busy.

31     A failure to exercise the requisite level of care and attention may therefore indicate a greater disregard for traffic and the safety of other road users: _PP v Neo Chuan Sheng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 97</span> at \[21\] – \[22\]. In some cases, e.g. as stated in the case of _PP v Tang Ling Lee_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span> (“_Tang Ling Lee”_) at \[41\] – \[45\], the degree of carelessness may border on recklessness, revealing the accused’s disregard for traffic or the safety of other road users.

32     As for the circumstances and causes of the careless driving, the Prosecution argued that the presence of any of the following factors can enhance the level of the accused’s culpability i.e. culpability-enhancing factors:

> (a)     Aggressive driving or competitive driving;

> (b)     Speeding for thrill-seeking;

> (c)     Deliberate flouting of traffic rules;

> (d)     Driving under the influence of drinks or drugs;

> (e)     Sleepy driving;

> (f)     Using a mobile phone while driving; or

> (g)     Evading arrest.

33     Following from there, the degree of culpability can be categorised into three sentencing bands:

> (a)     Low culpability: None of the culpability-enhancing factors are present (e.g.: momentary lapse of concentration, failing to give way when other road users have the right of way, or exhibiting poor control of vehicle);

> (b)     Moderate culpability: One or two of the culpability-enhancing factors are present; or

> (c)     High culpability: Many of the culpability-enhancing factors are present.

34     The rationale for the indicative sentencing ranges for the three different bands, according to the Prosecution, is to take into account the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament. It highlighted the High Court’s decision of _Poh Boon Kiat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> (_“Poh Boon Kiat”)_ at \[60\]:

> \[T\]he statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence”, and “the sentencing judge ought to note the maximum penalty imposed and then apply his mind to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament…

35     Next, the Prosecution highlighted that the sentencing range for low culpability situations should be 6 to 12 months by relying on this court’s earlier decision of _PP v Cullen Richard Alexander_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 88</span> (“_Cullen_”), which was a case involving causing grievous hurt from inconsiderate driving under the new RTA amendments.

36     At \[134\] of _Cullen_, this Court held that where the accused’s culpability was low and very serious grievous hurt was caused, the sentencing range is 6 to 9 months. The sentencing range for situations in which death has been caused therefore cannot be more lenient than situations in which only grievous hurt has been caused. The starting point should thus be at least 6 months where death is caused. At the same time, the upper end of the sentencing range should be more than 9 months where death is caused. In this regard, the Prosecution suggested 12 months for the upper end of the sentencing range under the low culpability band.

37     In appropriate cases, the Prosecution submitted that sentences lower than the starting point of 6 months where for example even fines may be imposed can include exceptional situations where the victim’s own negligence or rashness has materially contributed to the accident or where the victims or deceased persons are the accused’s close family members: _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1079</span> (“_Nickson Guay_”) at \[70\].

38     As for the sentencing range in the bands under moderate and high culpability categories, they should be 12 to 24 months and 24 to 36 months respectively i.e. a 12-month range for each band. The Prosecution avers that this will enable the sentencing ranges across the remaining two culpability bands to be spread evenly such that the maximum prescribed punishment of 3 years is reached for the band under high culpability.

39     Further, the starting point under the moderate culpability band of 12 months coincides with the statutory minimum punishment for reckless or dangerous driving causing grievous hurt. Similarly, the starting point under the high culpability band of 24 months coincides with the statutory minimum punishment for reckless or dangerous driving causing death. The Prosecution hence surmised that the proposed framework has some level of parity with the punishment prescribed for other types of similar bad driving.

40     Besides this, the sentence that is imposed must take into account two other factors. The first is offender-specific factors which relates to the personal circumstances of the offender_._ This can include his driving record, expression of remorse, or any other considerations which are particular to the offender rather than factors relating to the degree and circumstances of careless driving: _Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> at \[62\].

41     The next is the totality principle when an accused faces multiple charges which attract custodial terms. In such situations, further adjustments to the individual sentence imposed on the accused may be required to ensure that the aggregate sentence is not excessive. However, this is not applicable to the present case.

#### Prosecution’s position on sentence in relation to the accused

42     Applying the framework, the Prosecution submitted the accused’s culpability at moderate.

43     The Prosecution’s reasons are because the accused had:

> (a)     Failed to stop at the stop line before turning from Changi Beach Carpark 4 onto Nicoll Drive, the main road;

> (b)     Very nearly collided into a motorcyclist travelling in the same direction as the deceased just moments before the accident. The accused admitted that he did not see the motorcyclist till the last moment. The inescapable inference is that the accused did not pay sufficient attention to oncoming traffic;

> (c)     Seen the deceased coming towards him quickly with his head down. He horned and expected the deceased to stop and give way to him despite the deceased having the right of way. This expectation was not reasonable; and

> (d)     Driven a heavy and long vehicle with an unladen weight of 6240kg. The accused must have realised not only that he would take a longer time to make the turn, but also that any potential collision with his lorry could lead to fatal consequences. The deceased was particularly vulnerable as a cyclist.

44     Based on the above, the Prosecution submitted that the accused has shown disregard for the safety of the deceased and other road users at the time of the accident. He failed to stop at the stop line and proceeded to turn right without any apparent regard for traffic that might reasonably be expected to be travelling on the main road.

45     The Prosecution added that this is analogous to the facts in _Tang Ling Lee_ at \[41\]-\[45\], where the accused’s culpability was found to be moderate to high. Similarly, the accused’s culpability in the present case must be at least moderate.

46     In the circumstances, the Prosecution was of the view that the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range should be at least 13 to 14 months.

47     Further, the Prosecution relied on _Nickson Guay_ at \[70\] for the proposition that the deceased’s contributory negligence, if any, should not have a bearing on the sentence imposed:

> Where the conduct of the victim or third parties, whether negligent or otherwise, had materially contributed to the outcome for which the offender was being charged, but had no bearing on the _culpability_ of the offender, it should not affect the sentence to be imposed. \[emphasis in original\]

48     Here, the Prosecution argued that the deceased failed to look up while riding along the main road should not impact the assessment of whether the accused was more or less negligent in failing to meet the standard of care expected of all drivers. This is because the accused’s culpability is tagged to his failure to stop at the stop line and give way to the deceased who had the right of way. On the contrary, the accused’s failure to give way despite being cognisant of the fact that the deceased, for whatever reason, was looking down can be said to increase his culpability.

49     In support of this position, the Prosecution referred to _Hue An Li_ at \[81\]:

> For instance, if a driver spots a pedestrian from afar and sounds the horn to warn the pedestrian not to cross but does not slow down in anticipation of the pedestrian not heeding the warning, and if he tragically knocks down the pedestrian in such circumstances, he can and should be punished more severely.

50     As for the offender-specific factors, the accused has pleaded guilty at an early stage and is untraced. Yet, the Prosecution maintained that these factors should be given limited weight since there is overwhelming evidence against the accused on the present facts. Factoring in a slight discount, the Prosecution hence submitted that the appropriate imprisonment term here should be at least 12 months as a fair and effective deterrent sentence to send a signal to motorists to be considerate and drive responsibly. The deceased was a father of three young children and this was a consequence of an entirely avoidable accident.

### Mitigation

51     The Defence, on the other hand, submitted a sentence of three months’ imprisonment and the mandatory minimum 8 years’ DQAC to be imposed on the accused.

52     In support of its submissions, the Defence tendered a written mitigation on behalf of the accused.

53     The Defence has no quarrel with the Prosecution in relation to the disqualification period. However, it submitted that a custodial sentence of at least 12 months is manifestly excessive. While the degree of harm in such cases is unquestionably serious, the Defence submitted that a maximum custodial sentence of 3 months' imprisonment is appropriate given the accused’s low level of culpability in this case. He had further accepted full responsibility and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity as an indication of his remorse to these very unfortunate circumstances.

#### Defence’s proposed sentencing framework for s 65(2)(a) of the RTA

54     Like the Prosecution, Defence counsel agreed that it was Parliament’s intentions that cases of negligent driving causing death, which would have otherwise been prosecuted pursuant to s 304A(b) of the PC, would now be prosecuted under s 65(1) and punishable under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA.

55     Consequently, Parliament increased the minimum and maximum sentences for first time offenders from s 304A(b) of the PC to s 65(2)(a) read with s 65(6)(a) of the RTA as follows:

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"> <col width="50%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Section 304A(b) PC</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Section 65(2)(a) RTA</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory minimum: Not prescribed</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory minimum: Not prescribed</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory maximum:</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2 years</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory maximum:</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3 years</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Fine</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory minimum: Not prescribed</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory minimum: Not prescribed</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory maximum: Not prescribed</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory maximum: $10,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Disqualification from driving</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory minimum: Not prescribed</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory minimum:</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 years</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory maximum:</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Not prescribed</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statutory maximum: Not prescribed</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

The Defence noted that this represented a 50% increase in the maximum sentence for the imprisonment term.

56     In coming out with the proposed sentencing framework for s 65(2)(a) of the RTA, the Defence proposed to rely on the sentencing framework for s 65(3)(a) of the RTA as set out by this court in _Cullen_, following the decision of the High Court in _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> ("_Logachev_"), namely, that the appropriate sentence is to be determined in a 5-step approach:

> a)     Identify the level of the harm caused by the offence and the level of the offender's culpability;

> b)     Identify the applicable indicative sentencing range;

> c)     Identify the starting point within that indicative sentencing range;

> d)     Adjust the starting point to take into account aggravating and mitigating factors specific to an offender; and

> e)     Make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle.

57     Next, in evaluating the seriousness of a road traffic offence, the Defence relied on the well-established principals of harm caused by the offence and culpability of the offender as enunciated in _PP v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span> (_“Koh Thiam Huat”)_ at \[41\].

58     The Defence was in general agreement with the Prosecution that s 65(2)(a) of the RTA is concerned with a uniform type of harm i.e. the harm caused results in death. Hence, the distinction between cases is to be determined by reference to an accused’s culpability. In _Koh Thiam Huat_, culpability is defined at \[41\] as:

> \[A\] measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act.

59     The Defence also referred to _Tang Ling Lee_ at \[27\] to \[29\] read together with _Hue An Li_ at \[82\] to \[92\], where the courts have held that certain culpability -enhancing factors which affect both the manner and circumstances of driving are relevant in assessing an offender's culpability in driving offences. These culpability-enhancing factors are similar to those raised by the Prosecution in its submissions.

60     Additionally, the Defence sought assistance from legislative intention in measuring culpability by referring to the definitions of “Dangerous Driving” and “Careless Driving” in the Second Reading of RT (A) Bill at page 3 of 49:

> Dangerous Driving is more serious than Careless Driving. The two can be differentiated on a case-by-case basis. The three main considerations, among others, are as follows.

> First, whether the manner of driving predictably puts other road users at risk and cause other road users to be unable to react in time. Examples of driving that are considered as dangerous, as opposed to careless, include serving across lanes suddenly and without warning, driving against the flow of traffic and speeding.

> Second, whether the motorist had driven even though he should have known he was not in a condition to drive safely. Examples of behaviour that are considered dangerous include using mobile devices while driving and failing to use visual aids such as spectacles even though he is seriously short-sighted.

> Third, whether the road situation required the motorist to take extra care but he did not. Examples include when he is approaching a zebra crossing, or a junction where other road users have the right of way.

> When determining the punishment, we will look at the circumstances under which the offence is committed. The threshold for Dangerous Driving is higher than Careless Driving; so too the penalties.

61     Finally, the Defence referred to the definition framework as set out in _Cullen_ at \[109\] for assessing the level of culpability due to inconsiderate driving under the amended RTA.

62     Coming to the indicative sentencing range for each level of culpability, the Defence submitted that an increase in the maximum sentence that can be imposed by the courts does not per se warrant the imposition of a more severe sentence in every case. Ultimately, each case must be decided upon its unique factual matrix. The punishment imposed must reflect the gravity of the particular offence in question.

63     The Defence further submitted that since Parliament has not prescribed a mandatory minimum sentence to be imposed for s 65(2)(a) of the RTA (unlike s 64(2)(a) of the RTA), _Hue An Li_, which dealt with negligent driving causing death under s 304A(b) of the PC, remains relevant in relation to the starting point sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment (at \[133\]). The presence of any aggravating factors increases the starting point and the Defence suggested that this can be between two to four months’ imprisonment.

64     Taking into account the court’s obligation to utilise the full sentencing range as reiterated in _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[77\], the Defence proposed the following sentencing framework for accused who claims trial:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.28%"> <col width="49.72%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Level of Culpability</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Sentence</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 4 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">4 to 18 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">18 to 36 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

65     The Defence’s proposed starting position of up to 4 months for claim trial cases not only takes into consideration of Parliament’s intention to enhance the sentences for an offence previously prosecuted under s 304A(b) of the PC in the current s 65(2)(a) of the RTA but also a reflection that it continues to fall within the starting point sentence in _Hue An Li._

#### Defence’s position on sentence in relation to the accused

66     In terms of the accused’s culpability, the Defence submitted that it fell within the low category.

67     First, there was an absence of or limited culpability-enhancing factors that would serve to aggravate the accused’s manner of driving. It was accepted that the accused did not stop at the stop-line before making the right turn from the carpark exit onto Nicoll Drive. This fact already forms the basis of the charge against him and “due weight” that should be given by the court to that factor in sentencing will generally be none: _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ \[2018\] 5 SGHC 94 at \[91\]. Other than this, the video footage from the accused’s in-vehicle camera (“footage”) showed that the accused was driving at a slow pace when making the right turn at the uncontrolled junction.

68     Second, there was limited culpability-enhancing factors in the circumstances of driving. In fact, the only factor in this case is that the accused was driving a heavy vehicle, which he was licenced to drive. The road itself was not busy and a minor uncontrolled junction. It was not a residential or school zone. The accident occurred around 7.39am on a Sunday morning where traffic was expected to be light. The Defence disagreed with the Prosecution that merely because the deceased, as a cyclist, was a vulnerable class of road users, it was a rule that this was an added aggravating factor: _Hue An Li_ at \[78\].

69     Third, the accused’s judgment of oncoming traffic while exiting out of the carpark exit was affected by the condition of the road. Hence, even if the accused had stopped at the stop-line, due to the nature of the carpark exit, his line of sight down Nicoll Drive would have been obstructed by the curvature of the carpark exit and the trees aligned on the side of the road. The stop-line is located in the middle of the curved carpark exit and not aligned with Nicoll Drive. As such, the accused was unable to see the oncoming motorcycle.

70     Once the accused crossed the stop-line, the accused saw the deceased. He made a split-second judgment that the deceased was far enough away from him in order to execute the right turn safely due to the short distance across to the opposite side of Nicoll Drive towards Telok Paku Road.

71     From the footage, about seven seconds had elapsed between the time the accused crossed the stop-line and the point of collision with the deceased’s bicycle. Assuming that the deceased was travelling at about 30kmph, there was approximately at least 58 metres between the lorry and the bicycle before the collision. It was therefore apparent that the accused would have had enough time to clear the turn to avoid the deceased.

72     Due to the road conditions, the accused’s misjudged and failed to account for the motorcyclist. When he did see the motorcyclist, he stopped in the middle of the road for the motorcyclist to pass. Arguably, when he did so, the accused had the right of way and it was expected that other road users would have given way to him in the circumstances to avoid a collision.

73     Despite this, the accused had to complete the turn to avoid a collision with the deceased. In an attempt to avoid a collision, he applied the horn to warn the deceased of his presence in the middle of the road.

74     Fourth, there was contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. The Defence relied on _Nickson Guay_ at \[65\] for the proposition that this should be taken into account as it has a direct bearing on the accused’s culpability:

> \[W\]here the conduct of the victim or a third party had a direct bearing on the culpability of the offender, it should, in keeping with the principle of proportionality, be taken into account when determining the sentence to be meted out. Proportionality requires that the sentence be commensurate to the gravity of the offence, which was measured by, among other things, the moral culpability of the offender. In the context of a traffic death case, the moral culpability of the offender is usually linked to the extent of the offender's negligence and it can, in some circumstances, be affected by the behaviour of a third party or of the victim.

75     Here, the Defence was of the view that the deceased’s contributory negligence in not taking reasonable care of his own safety consisted of three factors.

76     First, the deceased was travelling in the middle of the road (i.e. middle of two lanes) as opposed to the far left of the road as required by r 8 of the Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules (1990 Rev. Ed.) (“Bicycle Rules”). R 8 states:

> **Bicycles etc. to be ridden on left side of road**

> 8.    A person who rides a bicycle, power-assisted bicycle, trishaw or tricycle on a road must ride the bicycle, power-assisted bicycle, trishaw or tricycle as near as practicable to the far left edge of the road.

77     When the accused first saw the deceased, he was cycling in the middle of the left and right lane. When the collision happened, the lorry was in the middle of the road. Yet, point of impact was to the middle of the right side of the said lorry. This indicated that the deceased’s bicycle was travelling on or closer to the right lane.

78     Second, the deceased was travelling at speed as the eyewitness who was travelling behind the accused at the material time described the deceased as travelling at between 30 to 34kmph. This is a fast speed for a bicycle. The deceased was also using a road racing bicycle with a finer frame and drop handlebars to take advantage of aerodynamics for speed.

79     Third, the deceased was not paying attention to the road in front of him. This was despite the fact that a total of seven seconds had elapsed between the time the accused commenced executing the turn and the collision. It is also consistent with the accused’s evidence in the SOF that he saw the deceased coming towards him quickly with his head down. Otherwise, the deceased would have braked in time to avoid the collision.

80     As for the appropriate sentence given the low culpability of the accused, as stated by the Defence above, the indicative sentencing range is up to four months’ imprisonment for an accused who claims trial with a starting point of four weeks’ imprisonment.

81     The Defence urged this court to consider precedent cases involving s 304A(b) of the PC as these cases are instructive in guiding the court in arriving at appropriate sentence to be meted out, having taken into account any aggravating and mitigating factors in this case.

82     The Defence cited six cases involving heavy vehicles.

83     In _PP v Lu Liancai_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 128</span> (“_Lu Liancai”_), the accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment and 5 years’ DQAC. The accused was driving a tipper truck and making a discretionary right turn at the signalised cross-junction when the right-turn green arrow was not on yet. His tipper truck collided into the deceased, who was cycling across the designated pedestrian crossing with the traffic light showing blinking green man in the deceased’s favour. He was also traced for minor traffic violations.

84     In _PP v Ang Gim Cheong_ (MAC 907716/2015 & Ors) decided on 4 Jan 2016 and cited at \[31\]-\[33\] of _Lu Liancai_, the accused was similarly driving a tipper truck. He was making a left turn from the extreme left lane of the main road into the entrance of the construction site. The deceased was cycling straight along the bicycle track that was running parallel to the entrance of the site. The accused failed to notice the accused when making the left turn and his tipper truck collided into the deceased and dragged the deceased for about 50m from the bicycle track. The accused had a poor driving record. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment and 5 years’ DQAC.

85     In _PP v Muhammad Firdaus Bin Norahim_ (DAC 917294/2015) decided on 22 June 2015 and cited at \[35\]-\[38\] of _Lu Liancai_, the accused was driving an off-service SBS bus. He was making a discretionary right turn at a signalised T-junction when the traffic light was showing green only. He failed to notice and his bus collided into the deceased, who was crossing at the designated pedestrian crossing with green man in her favour. The accused was untraced. The accused was sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment and 5 years’ DQAC.

86     In _PP v Ramamoorthy Saravanan_ (MAC900474/2016) decided on 2 Feb 2016 and cited at \[50\] of _Lu Liancai_, the accused was driving a lorry and was making a right turn at the non-signalised T-junction without slowing down or stopping. As a result, his lorry collided into the deceased, who was riding his motorcycle straight from the opposite direction and had the right of way. The accused was sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment and 5 years’ DQAC. He was untraced.

87     In _PP v Yong Ah Choon_ (MAC907563/2014) decided on 16 April 2015 and cited at \[44\]-\[45\] of _Lu Liancai_, the accused was driving a cement mixer truck, the accused was making a discretionary right turn when the traffic light was showing green light only. He failed to keep a proper lookout for pedestrians and his vehicle collided into the deceased who was crossing at the designated pedestrian crossing. Whilst the traffic light at the pedestrian crossing was unclear, the accused’s vehicle was the first vehicle waiting at the junction to turn right when the traffic light turned green. The accused was traced with a dated similar antecedent in 1966 under s 304A and fined $1,000. He was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment and 5 years’ DAQC.

88     In _PP v Tang Weng San_ (DAC930359/2015) decided on 18 August 2015 and cited at \[47\]-\[49\] of _Lu Liancai_, the accused was driving a lorry and making a right turn at a signalised T-junction when the traffic light was showing green only. He failed to stop at the right-turning pocket before executing the turn and collided into the deceased who was crossing at the pedestrian crossing when the traffic light was showing blinking green man. The accused was untraced and sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment and 5 years’ DQAC.

89     Based on the cases above, the Defence submitted that even when an accused was driving a heavy vehicle and the deceased was a vulnerable victim like a pedestrian or cyclist (i.e. presence of aggravating factors), the range of sentences under s 304A(b) of the PC for such cases was 2 weeks’ to 2 months’ imprisonment with 5 years’ DQAC. It added that the accused’s low culpability in the present case was at most, akin to that in _Lu Liancai or Ramamoorthy Saravan_ (i.e. in the middle of the range) which involved typical failures to give way to victims who had the right of way by keeping a proper lookout.

90     Additionally, when compared to the accused in _Cullen_, which was an inconsiderate driving causing grievous hurt case under the amended RTA, the Defence argued that the accused’s culpability here is lower than that of the accused in _Cullen_. In _Cullen_, the accused’s culpability was moderate because he sped, beat the red light, lost control of his vehicle and served to the opposite side of the road suddenly resulting in a head-on collision: at \[139\]-140\].

91     Finally, given that the accused has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and voluntarily surrendered himself into custody, the Defence said that this was an indication of his genuine remorse. He is the sole breadwinner for his mother and brother back in India. He is still young yet his impending custodial sentence and lengthy disqualification from driving would certainly end any future employment for him in Singapore as a lorry driver.

92     Taking into account the mitigating factors, the Defence proposed that there should be a downward calibration in the sentencing range for low culpability to not more than 3 months’ imprisonment and a DQAC of 8 years to meet the ends of justice in this very unfortunate case.

### Prosecution’s Reply

93     Pertaining to the factual matrix of the accident, the Prosecution highlighted its key point which was that even if the accused’s lorry was stationary momentarily to give way to the motorcyclist before moving off again, at that moment, the deceased was only about 5m away. According to the eyewitness, the deceased would have insufficient time to brake and stop safely in any event should the accused decide to proceed with making the right turn.

94     The Prosecution reiterated that the accused should not have turned at all if he could not turn safely without considering both the cyclist and the motorcyclist. The accused could not expect the cyclist to be able to give way by simply horning at him, particularly since he did not stop at the stop line before making the right turn.

95     On the point of contributory negligence, the Prosecution submitted that this was not applicable in the present case. Moreover, it would not affect the accused’s culpability because ultimately, the deceased had the right of way proceeding straight on the main road. This was so even if the deceased was looking downwards and did not see what was ahead of him. There was also no evidence that he was travelling beyond the speed limit of the road on his bicycle.

96     As for its proposed sentencing framework, the Prosecution explained that their starting point sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for low culpability was based on the framework in _Cullen_ for low culpability and serious harm in grievous hurt cases. This will provide the court a discretion to cater for situations of fines and shorter custodial sentences where the deceased was related to the accused or the accused himself was also badly injured.

97     Finally, the Prosecution reiterated that in view of Parliament’s intention that the purpose of the amendments to the RTA is to increase the sentencing norms for egregious and irresponsible driving offences, particularly where the consequences of such behaviour are dire, the authorities cited by the Defence for s 304A(b) of the PC, including _Hue An Li_, are clearly irrelevant and insufficient in addressing the legislative intent.

98     Accordingly, the Prosecution submitted that the 3 months’ imprisonment sought for by the Defence under the new s 65(2)(a) of the RTA was manifestly inadequate.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Sections 65(1)(b) and 65(2)(a) of the RTA

99     The news 65(1)(b) read with s 65(2)(a) of the RTA for inconsiderate driving causing death states:

> Driving without due care or reasonable consideration

> 65.— (1)    If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road —

>> (a)    without due care and attention; or

>> (b)    without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, the person (called the offender) shall be guilty of an offence.

>> (2)    If death is caused to another person by the driving of a motor vehicle by the offender, the offender shall on conviction of an offence under subsection (1) —

>> (a)    be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both;

> ……

100    For an offence punishment under s 65(2)(a), the disqualification period is stated at s 65(6)(a) of the RTA as follows:

> (6)    A court convicting a person of an offence under subsection (1) in the following cases is to, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to not order or to order otherwise, order that the person be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a disqualification period of _not less than the specified period_ corresponding to that case:

>> (a)    for an offender or a repeat offender in subsection (2)(a) or (b) — _8 years_;

> …… \[Emphasis added\]

101    Under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA, there is a mandatory minimum period of 8 years for the disqualification order that a court must impose unless there are special reasons the court thinks fit for it to order otherwise.

102    Here, as both parties agree that there are no special reasons in the circumstances, I agree that the statutory requirement of 8 years’ DQAC must be imposed as the disqualification order.

103    In relation to the rationale for the amendments to the RTA which came into force on 1 November 2019, I had in my decision in _Cullen_ at \[70\] – \[75\] set out generally Parliament’s intention to enhance criminal penalties for road traffic offences so as to provide a stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving to make our roads safer. The enhanced criminal penalties include introducing higher minimum mandatory sentences (including disqualification periods) to keep irresponsible motorists off the roads for a longer period as well as higher maximum sentences as compared to the existing penalties under the PC or the RTA (prior to the new amendments).

104    Another reason for the amendments is to consolidate driving offences previously prosecuted under the PC, like rash and negligent acts, under the RTA. This will enable the offences to be streamlined under the RTA into (i) Reckless or Dangerous Driving under s 64; and (ii) Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration (also known as “inconsiderate driving”) under s 65.

105    Besides the manner of driving or circumstances in which the traffic offence is committed, the level of harm caused by the offender is also considered in the overall approach. The four levels of harm are (i) Death; (ii) Grievous hurt; (iii) Hurt; and (iv) Endangering life. Therefore, the greater the harm caused, the level of punishment will be higher.

106    The overall enhanced approach envisaged under the new RTA encompasses the harm and culpability sentencing factors (i.e. culpability of the offender versus the harm caused by him to others), which the courts have traditionally considered in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on an offender. In the past, the prescribed punishments for inconsiderate and dangerous driving were not specifically calibrated based on the degree of harm caused by the offender.

107    The prescribed punishment for inconsiderate driving has holistically increased as well. For example, the maximum punishment for a first offender in the past for inconsiderate driving was a fine not exceeding $1,000 or an imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both. Now, the maximum fine for inconsiderate driving where no hurt is caused (or what Prosecution terms as inconsiderate driving _simpliciter_) to any person has increased to $1,500 for a first offender. The maximum imprisonment term remains the same at 6 months.

108    As for fatal accidents, in the past, the present accused would likely to have been charged under s 304A(a) of the PC for causing death due to a negligent act. Now, due to the new RTA amendments, he is charged under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA for inconsiderate driving causing death.

109    A comparison of the respective punishment provisions for rash and negligent acts under the PC and those under the new RTA amendments for inconsiderate and dangerous driving reveal that the maximum sentencing penalties are generally higher under the new RTA:

110    Additionally, besides imposing a specific mandatory minimum disqualification period for causing death due to inconsiderate or dangerous driving unless for special reasons like a medical emergency, there is also a mandatory minimum custodial sentence of not less than 2 years for causing death due to dangerous driving.

111    As such, the precedent cases for the old s 65(1) of the RTA, where only appropriate fines and DQAC sentences were typically meted out by the courts, are clearly of little assistance. They may still be of some relevance for cases under the inconsiderate driving _simpliciter_ provision of s 65(5) of the new RTA.

112    As for the precedent cases under s 304A(b) of the PC, given that the maximum sentencing penalty for the imprisonment term is now increased from two years to three years for causing death in a road traffic accident, I agree with the Prosecution that these cases like _Hue An Li_ may now be of little relevance in deriving a rational sentencing framework for the new s 65(2)(a) of the RTA.

#### Sentencing framework for inconsiderate driving causing death

113    In _Cullen_, at \[104\], I adopted the five-step approach as set out in _Logachev_ to draw up the sentencing framework for s 65(3)(a) of the RTA.

114    Here, I will similarly adopt the same five-step approach.

115    As the accused only faces one charge, the totality principle (i.e. 5th Step) is not applicable in the present case.

116    Once again, before I come to the proposed sentencing framework itself, it is important to bear in mind the two observations made by Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Logachev_ at \[73\] – \[75\]:

> \[73\]  First, this framework is intended to apply to offenders who _claim trial_. In this regard, I agree with the following observations in _Terence Ng_ (at \[40\]):

>> …\[W\]e would clarify that the benchmark sentences we are laying down apply to ‘contested cases’ – that is to say, convictions entered _following trial_. There are at least two reasons for this. The first is based on sentencing theory. The mitigating value of a plea of guilt cannot be fixed, but is personal to the particular offender, and it is affected by factors such as the degree of remorse displayed and the extent to which the offender had ‘no choice’ but to plead guilty because he had been caught in _flagrante delicio…_We will elaborate on the proper weight to be ascribed to a plea of guilt later, but it suffices to say for now that it is clear that this makes it difficult to set a benchmark sentence by reference to uncontested cases \[where\] no uniform weight can be attached to a plea of guilt. The second is an argument based on constitutional principle. The law accords every accused person a basic right to plead not guilty and to claim trial to a charge….If the benchmarks were set by reference to uncontested cases, then it would follow that an uplift should be applied where an offender claims trial. This would lead to the ‘appearance’ that offenders who claim trial are being penalised for exercising their constitutional right to claim trial…\[emphasis in original\]

> \[74\]  I note that the court in _Terence Ng_ went on to state (at \[41\]) that its comments as just quoted above did not mean that it would never be appropriate to promulgate a benchmark sentence on the basis of an uncontested case, and that it might be appropriate to do so where, for example, the “typical case” was one where the charge was uncontested. In the context of the offences punishable under s172A(2) of the CCA, given the relatively short existence of this provision (which came into effect only in January 2013), it seems to me too soon to conclude what the “typical case” under this provisions would be. The framework proposed below therefore applies to contested cases, with a guilty plea taken into account as an offender-specific mitigating factor at the fourth step…

> \[75\]  Second, and again flowing from the relatively short existence of s172A(2) of the CCA, the dearth of sentencing precedents means that the framework which I suggest below should not be regarded as being cast in stone. With the accretion of case law, aspects of this framework may need to be subsequently reconsidered and refined. For instance, I have already emphasised that the sentencing considerations identified in the table at \[37\] above are non-exhaustive (see \[38\] above). As our case law develops, these sentencing considerations may be added to.

117    In essence, bearing in mind that the sentencing considerations in relation to both harm and culpability identified for the offence of inconsiderate driving can be non-exhaustive and s 65(2)(a) of the RTA is a new provision which only came into effect on 1 November 2019, the proposed sentencing framework is intended to provide some form of guidance given that this will be the first case to be decided under this new provision. It is therefore not cast in stone and it is subject to reconsideration and refinement as our case law develops.

118    The proposed sentencing framework is intended to apply to offenders who claims trial with adjustments to be made for PG cases by taking into account offender-specific mitigating factors.

119    Lastly, I am in general agreement with the Prosecution and Defence that as the only eventuality of the harm caused in fatal accidents is death, there is no distinction in the level of harm. Thus, for the purpose of the sentencing framework under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA, I will only deal with the degree of culpability of an accused.

##### Level of culpability

120    In _Cullen_, which was also a case involving inconsiderate driving under s 65(1)(b) of the RTA under the new RTA amendments, I had set out a suggested working or functional definition in relation to the level of culpability at \[109\] as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.58%"> <col width="70.42%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Level of Culpability</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Definition</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Generally, no dangerous driving behaviour exhibited. Typically careless or inconsiderate in the manner of driving like failing to give way when other road users have the right of way or exhibiting poor control of vehicle.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Some manner of dangerous driving behaviour exhibited.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This may include swerving across lanes suddenly and without warning, driving against the flow of traffic, weaving in and out of traffic, speeding, beating of the red light, handphone driving, sleepy driving or failing to use visual aids while driving etc.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious manner of dangerous driving behaviour exhibited.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This may include several forms of dangerous driving behaviour exhibited, dangerous driving behaviour exhibited over an extended distance of driving or deliberate bad driving behaviour.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

\*Drunk driving or driving under the influence of drugs will be dealt with additionally under a “serious offender” as defined in s64(8) of the RTA.

121    I had come up with this table after taking guidance from High Court decisions involving road traffic offences like _Tang Ling Lee_ and _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 185</span> (_“Stansilas”_): See _Cullen_ at \[106\]-\[108\].

122    The Prosecution suggested that I consider its definition of the different levels of culpability based on the number of culpability-enhancing factors instead. Also, the element of dangerous driving can be confusing in an inconsiderate driving charge.

123    The element of dangerous driving behaviour to describe the manner of driving has been seen in the definition of the different levels of culpability in _Stansilas_, which was a case where the accused had committed the offence of drunk driving and caused an accident.

124    There is an overlap in terms of culpability for inconsiderate and dangerous driving. As highlighted by the Prosecution that it has been stated in _Tang Ling Lee_ that the “degree of carelessness may border on recklessness” depending on the manner and circumstances of driving in a particular accident.

125    Hence, an accused may be charged for causing an accident by beating the red light under inconsiderate driving (e.g. _Cullen_) or dangerous driving. This is entirely a prosecutorial discretion depending on the nature of the case. Nonetheless, the degree of culpability between these two types of offences can overlap. An offender may have a higher level of culpability under an inconsiderate driving offence but a lower level of culpability under a dangerous driving offence. Following from there, when calibrating the level of culpability for a dangerous driving offence, this will have to be calibrated upwards.

126    Further, some culpability-enhancing factors may be more aggravating than others and having one such factor alone may be sufficient to raise the level of culpability higher. An example is an offender driving against the flow of traffic along an expressway. In that event, stating a numeric number for the number of culpability-enhancing factors to fall within a certain band may not always be possible.

127    Although I have kept the table in _Cullen_ here, I am grateful for the feedback from the Prosecution.

##### Applicable indicative sentencing range for each level of culpability and the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range

128    As for the indicative sentencing range, in _Cullen_, when I drew up the sentencing framework for inconsiderate driving causing grievous hurt, the sentencing range for low culpability and very serious harm is 6 to 9 months’ imprisonment. Given that harm is always very serious for causing death situations, I am in general agreement with the Prosecution that other than exceptional situations (e.g. when the deceased was a family member of the accused), the starting point sentence for inconsiderate driving causing death should be 6 months.

129    Next, even though both parties have submitted differing views whether precedent cases under s 304A of the PC should be used as a reference or be considered, the learned DPP has kindly, at the court’s request, provided a sentencing precedent table of cases for rash driving under s 304A(a) of the PC.

130    Rash driving is a more serious offence than inconsiderate or negligent driving. This will provide an indicative gauge as to what a reasonable uplift should be for the new s 65(2)(a) of the RTA. Further, although s 304A(a) of the PC covers a whole spectrum of offences and not merely road traffic offences, the maximum prescribed punishment of 5 years’ imprisonment is still higher than that under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA (i.e. 3 years’ imprisonment).

131    The main case is _PP v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> (“_Ganesan”_). The accused had executed a U-turn with his lorry along Woodlands Road. He then quickly cut across two lanes after executing the U-turn to turn left. As a result, the accused’s lorry collided with the first victim’s motorcycle that was travelling down the opposite side of the road. The second victim, who was the pillion rider and then five months’ pregnant, succumbed to her injuries and passed away. The accused claimed trial.

132    Before coming to its decision, the High Court laid down the sentencing framework for cases under s 304A(a) of the PC where an accused claims trial at \[55\]:

133    The accused in _Ganesan_ was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment and 8 years’ DQAC, where his culpability was found to be low.

134    The High Court in _Ganesan_ also referred to the following category 2 cases where the accused had either pleaded guilty or was convicted after trial at \[62\] – \[63\]:

> (a)     _Fabian Chua_: The accused was driving his car and failed to comply with a “Turn Left Only” sign when exiting from a minor road into a major road. He intended to turn into another minor road at the other side of the major road. In order to do so, he drove across the four lanes of the major road, cutting across a double white line, and encroached into the path of a motorcycle on the extreme right lane. When the accused arrived at the point of collision, he had travelled against the flow of traffic. The victim tried to take evasive action but his motorcycle collided into the rear right of the accused’s car and he was flung out of his motorcycle. The accused _pleaded guilty_ and was sentenced to _seven months’ imprisonment and ten years’ disqualification (all classes)_.

> (b)     _Chew Tuan Peow_: The accused was a prime mover driver who drove into the compound of a factory from an unauthorised entrance to avoid queuing at the main entrance. He made a right turn against the flow of traffic into a driveway, failed to keep a proper lookout, and collided into the victim who was a pedestrian walking from his right to left. He _pleaded guilty_ and was sentenced to _seven months’ imprisonment and ten years’ disqualification (all classes)._

> (c)     _Bu Xiao Ming_: The accused was a tipper truck driver. At the material time, he stopped behind a white truck, and both vehicles were waiting to make a right turn at a signalised T-junction. When their light was green only, the accused cut across the centre continuous white line to overtake the stationary white truck from its right and made a right turn. The accused encroached into the travel path of the victim, who was a motorcyclist travelling straight from the opposite direction on the green light. The victim swerved to the right but could not stop in time and collided into the left middle portion of the accused’s truck. He was run over by the left middle and left rear tyres of the accused’s tipper truck. The accused was _convicted after trial_ and sentenced to _nine months’ imprisonment and eight years’ disqualification (all classes)_.

> …

> (a)     _PP v Tan Hie Koon_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 87</span>: The accused was driving his taxi at an excessive speed (78km/h on a 50km/h road). He thereafter failed to have proper control of his taxi, resulting in him losing control of the taxi along a straight stretch of road, causing his taxi to veer to the right and collide into the victim who was a pedestrian standing on the right-most lane of a five-lane carriageway. The accused was _convicted after trial_ and sentenced to _six months’ imprisonment and eight years’ disqualification (all classes)_. His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed.

> (b)     _PP v Kevyn Keifer Keith Keanu Wallace Yap C Hock_ Magistrate’s Arrest Case No 8730 of 2013: The accused was driving a lorry along an expressway, with the victim as a front seat passenger. At this time, there was an off-service bus on the same lane ahead of the accused’s lorry, and another white lorry in the middle lane, to the right of the accused and the bus. As the three vehicles approached a slip road, the bus slowed down and came to a halt to allow another bus to enter the expressway from the slip road. Instead of slowing down behind the bus, the accused maintained the speed of his vehicle and attempted to abruptly change lanes to the middle lane and overtake the bus. However, the white lorry on the middle lane was already travelling abreast with the accused’s vehicle. As a result, the accused’s vehicle collided with the left of the white lorry, causing the white lorry to veer to the left and collide with the right side of the bus. The accused’s vehicle then collided into the rear of the bus, with the point of collision at the left front of the accused’s vehicle, where the victim was seated. The accused _pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment and eight years’ disqualification (all classes)_. The Prosecution contended that this case did not involve the violation of a traffic rule. In reply, the Respondent referred to various provisions in the Highway Code (Cap 276, R 11, 1990 Rev Ed) and claimed that they were violated. In my view, however, regardless of whether a traffic regulation was violated, it was clear that the degree of rashness exhibited by the accused was very high.

> (c)     _PP v Sum Yew Leong_ District Arrest Case No 922727 of 2014: The accused was driving a tipper truck into a car park as he was headed to the rubbish collection centre. At the entrance of the car park, he was required to make a left turn and drive around the car park (which was a one-way road) to reach the rubbish collection centre. However, he took a shortcut by driving straight towards the rubbish collection centre. By doing so, he disobeyed the “No Entry” sign and travelled against the flow of traffic. He did so in order to save time. Thereafter, the accused made a left turn. At this point in time, the victim was cycling at around the left front side of the accused’s tipper truck. The accused’s execution of a left turn caused his tipper truck to collide into the victim. The accused _pleaded guilty_ and was sentenced to _eight months’ imprisonment and ten years’ disqualification (all classes)_.

> (d)     _PP v Yahya Abdul Kader_ District Arrest Case No 43409 of 2013: The accused was driving a minibus along a road where there was a gradual right bend ahead. Instead of following through with the right bend, he drove the minibus straight up onto the pavement. At the material time, the two victims, who were tourists, were standing on that portion of the pavement taking photographs. The minibus mounted the road kerb, veered towards the left and collided into the two victims. It came to a stop only after colliding into the side wall of a nearby unit. Both victims were flung off the pavement due to the impact of the collision – one was flung over the side wall and landed in the compound, while the other landed on the left-most lane of the road. Both victims eventually died. The _accused pleaded guilty_ and was sentenced to _nine months’ imprisonment and eight years’ disqualification (all classes)_. Although it was once again contended by the Prosecution that this case did not involve the violation of a traffic rule, the fact that the accused’s minibus could end up on the pavement and the fact that one of the victims was flung _over_ the side wall made it quite clear to me that this case must have involved a high degree of rashness. \[emphasis added\]

135    I note from _Ganesan_ that depending on whether an accused claims trial or pleads guilty, the accused from the category 2 cases with moderate culpability typically receives a sentence of between five to nine months’ imprisonment and a DQAC of between eight to ten years.

136    Having considered the precedent cases for rash driving causing death as well as both parties’ suggested framework and having to take into account the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament (See _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[60\]), I am in general agreement with the sentencing range proposed by the Prosecution for each individual level of culpability. The suggested sentencing framework in relation to s 65(2)(a) of the RTA for an accused who claims trial is as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.52%"> <col width="75.48%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em><u>CULPABILITY</u></em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S 65(2)(a) RTA</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Up to $10,000 OR Up to 3 years OR Both</b></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>AND</b></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Mandatory DQ: At least 8 years</b></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><em><u>Pre-1 Nov 19:</u></em></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><em>No prescribed punishment for this category of inconsiderate driving</em></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em><u>Sentence</u></em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>LOW</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6 – 12 months</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(A fine of up to $10,0000 or lower sentences may be imposed in exceptional cases)</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>MODERATE</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 – 24 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>HIGH</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">24 - 36 months (max)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

137    I have also borne in mind that the presumptive sentencing range for low culpability under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA is the same as that under moderate culpability under s 304A(a) of the PC in _Ganesan_. The mandatory minimum DQAC of 8 years for s 65(2)(a) of the RTA is the same for several of the moderate culpability cases under s 304A(a) of the PC as discussed in _Ganesan_. The sentencing range for each level of culpability is also in line with the mandatory minimum prescribed punishment under the RTA for dangerous driving causing grievous hurt (i.e. 1 year’s imprisonment) and death (i.e. 2 years’ imprisonment) respectively in view of the higher level of culpability in dangerous driving as submitted by the Prosecution.

#### The appropriate sentence imposed

138    With the proposed sentencing framework, I now apply it to the accused’s case.

139    For the level of culpability, based on the proposed sentencing framework, I am of the view that this is low. I now give my reasons.

140    At the outset, I should highlight that this is not a typical major road-minor road accident at an uncontrolled junction.

141    This was a collision which occurred at an uncontrolled junction, where vehicles travelling on the major road (i.e. Nicoll Drive) have the right of way and vehicles coming out from the minor road, (i.e. the carpark) have to ensure that it is safe before turning out into the major road.

142    Here, although the accused’s lorry was travelling at a slow speed as he was driving out from the carpark, he failed to stop the lorry at the stop line at the exit of the carpark before proceeding to make the right turn onto Nicoll Drive. Still shots taken from the footage of the accused’s in-vehicle camera confirmed this:

![]([2020] SGDC 0252_Image/[2020] SGDC 0252_image3.png)

143    From the footage, it was about 7s between the time the accused’s lorry was at the stop line until the time of the collision with the deceased. Assuming the deceased had travelled at about 30 to 34 kmph as per the SOF, the deceased would have been at a distance of about 60 to 66m away from the accused’s lorry just as the lorry was at the stop line.

144    It was unlikely that when the accused saw the deceased prior to making the right turn, the deceased was 200m away as observed by the accused and as stated in the SOF. If so, the deceased would have been speeding at a speed of at least 100kmph on his racing bicycle. There is no evidence before me that the deceased was speeding beyond the speed limit of the Nicoll Drive at 50kmph.

145    If the accused had stopped at the stop line to check for oncoming vehicles, he might have noticed both the motorcycle and the deceased riding at speed towards him from the right side with his head down. As such, the accused might not have proceeded to make the turn but instead give way for them to pass first. As it is, he had to stop momentarily halfway while making the turn to give way to the motorcycle, whom he had failed to see earlier, coming from his right.

146    Having said that, the fact that the accused had stopped midway to give way to the motorcyclist did not mean that he thereafter had the right of way such as to expect other road users on the main road to give way to him as suggested by the Defence. The accused had, after all, created a dangerous situation by making the turn out to the main road when it was not safe to do so. In any event, his lorry was only stationary momentarily for a split second and not for an extended period of time.

147    Next, the accused was driving a long and heavy vehicle. There was a greater reason for him to stop at the stop line to ensure that it was safe for his entire vehicle to make the right turn before proceeding to do so. This is so even if the junction is not a long one and he believed that he could execute the turn quickly. Otherwise, as evident here, a collision with his lorry can lead to dire consequences.

148    In view of the length of his vehicle, the accused, by failing to stop at the stop line, had misjudged the situation when he thought that he could safely complete the right turn with the deceased’s bicycle being at about 60 to 66m away from him.

149    In fact, the fact that accused was driving a heavy vehicle would have, on its own, increased his culpability to the higher end of the range for low culpability.

150    I disagree with the Defence’s argument that even if the accused had stopped at the stop line, he view of oncoming vehicles would have been obstructed due to the nature of the carpark exit or the curvature of the road. It was not a situation here where the accused had stopped at the stop line but inched his lorry out slowly due to any obstructions, e.g. trees along the side of the road, to check and ensure that it was safe to turn out.

151    Generally, I accept the Defence’s submission that the present case is of a lower culpability than the accused in _Cullen_, whose culpability was at moderate because he had caused a head-on collision by travelling at a fast speed, beating the red light and swerving to the opposite side of the road.

152    Here, there are no other culpability-enhancing factors that would serve to aggravate the accused’s manner of driving i.e. some manner of dangerous driving behaviour exhibited e.g. beating of red light, sleepy driving etc. as well as the circumstances of driving that will put the accused’s level of culpability into the moderate range.

153    The low level of culpability is consistent with the definition found in the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework in respect of an offender who has failed to give way when other road users have the right of way.

154    As regards to the Prosecution’s submission that the facts here are analogous to the facts in _Tang Ling Lee_, where the collision happened at a signalised traffic junction, I am of the view that a distinction must be made when an accident happens at a controlled as compared to an uncontrolled junction. This is because road users expect a greater predictability with traffic signals and hence a corollary expectation they will be adhered to by others.

155    In _Tang Ling Lee_, the accused made a discretionary right turn when the green arrow signal had not come on yet. Prior to doing so, she did not stop at the right turning pocket to look out for oncoming vehicles in the opposite direction like the victim’s motorcycle who was about to cross the junction with the green light still clearly in his favour. This resulted in the collision. In the circumstances, the culpability of the accused in _Tang Ling Lee_ should be higher than in the present case.

156    The Prosecution further argued that on the facts, the accused should still be punished more severely because when he saw that the deceased was coming towards him quickly with his head down, he horned and expected the deceased to stop and given way to him as he was already halfway making the turn.

157    To my mind, this scenario is not the same as anticipated by the High Court at \[81\] in _Hue An Li_ where the driver had spotted a pedestrian from afar, sounded the horn to warn the pedestrian and yet did nothing to slow down in anticipation of the pedestrian not heeding the warning.

158    In the present accused’s case, he had stopped momentarily to give way to the motorcyclist. He was already in the middle of the main road. By sounding the horn to warn other road users of his presence on the main road, this did not equate to him doing nothing. More so when the evidence was that the deceased was seen looking down when riding on his bicycle. If the deceased did not see the presence of the lorry on the main road at all, the horning would have made a difference to alert him regardless of whether the accused had continued to turn after giving way to the motorcyclist or not.

##### The issue of contributory negligence

159    The issue of contributory negligence on the part of the deceased was raised by both parties. Both the Prosecution and Defence cited different portions of _Nickson Guay_ in support for or against the proposition that the contributory negligence of the victim or a third party should have no bearing on the sentence imposed on an accused.

160    Ultimately, the key point as enunciated by the High Court in _Nickson Guay_ is this: the conduct of the victim or a third party must have a direct bearing on the culpability of the offender in order to affect the sentence to be imposed (at \[70\]). In that event, the principle of proportionality should be taken into account when determining sentence to commensurate with the gravity of the offence.

161    Sundaresh Menon CJ explained the two reasons at \[70\]-\[71\] of _Nickson Guay_:

> First, as was explained in _Hue An Li_ (\[12\] _supra_), the outcome materiality principle trumps the control principle in the context of criminal negligence. Parliament has decided that outcomes matter and the role of the court is to exercise its sentencing discretion within the framework established by Parliament…\[T\]he fact of the matter is that the appellant had, through his negligent conduct, caused a collision to take place which resulted in the death of a person. If what he is saying is that his sentence should be reduced to reflect the fact that he was “unfortunate” to have collided with a vehicle in which there was an unrestrained child as opposed to one without, I would reject this submission. There can be no principled basis on which the Court should mitigate the sentence on account of an offender’s “moral (bad) luck” ….

> Second, and more fundamentally, a putative offender either is or is not legally responsible for the death of the victim; there are no degrees of legal responsibility. In convicting an offender, the court has determined as a matter of criminal law that the offender is _legally responsible for the death…_\[It\] would, therefore, be inconsistent to then punish him on the basis that he is somehow less responsible for the harm that was occasioned by his negligent conduct. The sentence meted out should in my judgment be proportionate to his moral culpability and all the resulting harm that he is _legally responsible for_. \[emphasis in original\]

162    In _Nickson Guay_, it was held that the failure to properly secure the deceased, who was being breastfed at the material time of the accident by his mother in the left rear seat of his father’s vehicle and hence not secured in an approved child restraint was not a relevant consideration in sentencing. It had no bearing on the negligence of the accused who had made a discretionary right turn at the traffic light junction when the lights were in favour of the vehicle of deceased’s father proceeding straight on green.

163    Accordingly, the facts in _Nickson Guay_ were quite different from the present case. There, the deceased was a passenger and had no involvement in causing the accident.

164    On one hand, I accept the Prosecution’s submissions that ultimately, the factors of contributory negligence raised by the Defence would not affect the accused’s culpability for the accident and causing the death of the deceased.

165    On the other hand, the appropriate sentence to be impose on the accused should still be proportionate to his moral culpability as a consequence of the misjudgement on his part to make the right turn that day given the circumstances at the material time. This is a factual inquiry which requires the court to analyse all the evidence as a whole.

166    An example will be an accused intending to make a right turn out into the main road. He saw the victim’s vehicle a distance away. Ordinarily, he would have cleared the turn safely with that distance. However, the victim was speeding. Despite that, the accused decided to proceed ahead and could not make the turn safely resulting in a collision occurred. Unfortunately, the accused would still be responsible for his misjudgement since he did not have the right of way to execute the turn.

167    I would further highlight that in the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework, it indicated that the presumptive sentencing range under low culpability can be lower than the starting point of 6 months (or even fines) in appropriate cases. An example for consideration is when the victim’s own negligence or rashness has materially contributed to the accident. As such, the Prosecution is attuned to the proportionality principle.

168    I now come to the factors raised by the Defence on the deceased’s contributory negligence.

169    The first factor relates to the victim riding in the middle of the road (i.e. middle of two lanes) instead of the far-left edge of the road in breach of r 8 of the Bicycle Rules.

170    From the evidence based on the damage found on the accused’s lorry (i.e. a dent near to the right side front middle portion), the length of the accused’s lorry and the position of his lorry at the point of the collision (i.e. about to cross the centre road divider), this confirmed that the deceased was not riding on the far left edge of the road. The deceased was in all likelihood travelling in between the two lanes or on the left side of the right lane.

171    If the deceased had been travelling at the far left edge of the second lane and the accused collided into him as soon as he turned out of the carpark without stopping at the stop line, the accused would have been more culpability than in the present case as it would not only be more apparent for the accused to have seen the deceased along the left lane, there would also have been less reaction time for the deceased to see the lorry and brake in time.

172    The fact that the deceased was travelling in between two lanes or even on the right lane in this case would only go towards in suggesting the possible speed of travel of the deceased’s bicycle. Generally, the faster vehicles or vehicles intending to overtake will travel on the right lane.

173    The second factor relates to the fast speed of travel of the deceased’s bicycle at the material time. It was undisputed that the deceased was riding a racing bicycle.

174    The relative speed of travel of both vehicles will always have a direct bearing on the extent of harm caused. If one or both vehicles were speeding or travelling at a faster speed prior to the collision, the impact from the collision is likely to be greater than if both had travelled at a normal speed.

175    For example, if a victim riding a motorcycle had travelled at a faster speed at 70kmph compared to the speed limit of the main road at 50kmph, then the conduct of the victim would have had materially contributed to the accident and this will have a direct bearing on the culpability of an accused and the extent of the resulting harm caused if other factors remain constant.

176    In the present case, there is no evidence that the deceased had travelled beyond the speed limit of Nicoll Drive at 50kmph. The only evidence we have was from an eyewitness who was travelling at about 40 to 50m behind the deceased. He observed that the deceased was riding at 30 to 34 kmph on his racing bicycle.

177    Based on the vehicle damage report of the deceased’s bicycle, there was only damage to the right handlebar and the left arm rest. Otherwise, there was generally no damage to the frame of the bicycle. In particular, both the front and rear tyres and wheel rims were not twisted or damaged. The inspection report by LKK Auto Consultants further confirmed this.

178    The photographs and vehicle damage report of the accused’s lorry showed a prominent circular inward dent to the right side of the container body creating a partial hole. Based on the damage caused, this suggested that the impact was not small. There was no other damage on the lorry.

179    The evidence suggested that there was no direct contact between the lorry and the bicycle. The damage to the bicycle was due to the bicycle falling on the road. The dent on the container of the lorry was due to the deceased’s body being propelled forward away from his bicycle such that his head, together with his helmet, hit the right side of the lorry with a force. This is consistent with the cervical spine injuries sustained by the deceased.

180    Therefore, for this to have happened, it was very likely that the deceased, who was seen riding quickly with his head down, did brake his bicycle when he finally saw the lorry in front of him. Although it is not known how fast the bicycle was travelling at that time or when exactly did the deceased see the lorry, given the size of the deceased (a 76kg male at 1.78m tall), if after having braked to stop his bicycle, the deceased would have lost his grip on the bicycle and his body flung forward for a distance due to the inertia from braking before hitting the lorry. This would suggest that the bicycle was not slow and in fact travelling at a fast speed at the material time.

181    It is not clear how far away the bicycle was when the deceased saw the lorry. The eyewitness mentioned that the deceased was about 5m from the carpark exit when the accused’s lorry stopped momentarily to allow the motorcycle to pass. Assuming that the deceased had only seen the lorry (i.e. at 5m away) then and the bicycle had no direct contact with the lorry, that would mean that the deceased would have been flung out of his bicycle for a distance after he applied his brakes and hit the lorry with a great impact.

182    The third factor concerns the fact that the deceased did not pay attention to the road in front of him as he was riding quickly with his head down. There was a period of about 7s between the time the lorry was at the stop line to the collision. This was a distance of about 60 to 66m. If the deceased had kept a proper lookout of the traffic ahead of him, he would have braked earlier to avoid the accident.

183    The Prosecution disagreed that the third factor could even be considered a contributory negligence. In fact, it argued that this was an aggravating factor because the accused failed to give way to the deceased even though he knew that the deceased was riding at a fast speed with his head down.

184    I am unable to agree that the third factor is an aggravating factor as suggested by the Prosecution.

185    The key point really is: when did the deceased first see the accused’s lorry and apply his brakes to avoid the accident?

186    If the deceased had seen the accused at the stop line of the carpark at about 60 to 66m away and 7s prior to the collision, it is likely that the deceased would have braked or even slowed down his bicycle to avoid the lorry completely.

187    However, as the deceased was seen riding his bicycle fast with his head down, by the time he realised that the accused’s lorry was just ahead of him and halfway executing the right turn, it was too late. Given the speed of his bicycle, even as he managed to brake his bicycle, he was still propelled forward to hit the lorry.

188    Another possibility was that the deceased could have seen the lorry earlier and tried to follow the motorcycle on the right lane to avoid the lorry. If the accused had horned at the deceased to alert him but not continue to turn, the deceased’s bicycle could, like the motorcycle, have passed through safely. Unfortunately, the accused continued to make the turn thus, giving the deceased little reaction time.

189    In a nutshell, I make two observations.

190    First, even if could be said that the deceased had failed to keep a proper lookout for the traffic ahead of him while travelling at a fast speed on his bicycle, if the accused had seen the deceased riding at a fast speed in between lanes with his head down at the stop line at about 60 to 66m away and still decided to make the turn, this would have been a clear misjudgement on the accused’s part.

191    The rule of thumb is that if one is unsure if he is able to make the turn safely based on the traffic conditions of the main road at the material time, then he ought to err on the side of caution and wait before it is safe to do so.

192    Second, the deceased did not pay attention to the road conditions ahead of him until it was too late. Even when a road user has the right of way, he should still exercise due care and caution to ensure his own safety and not be oblivious to the traffic conditions ahead of him. This will allow one adequate reaction time to deal with any unforeseen circumstances.

##### Vulnerable victims

193    I accept the Defence’s submission on the fact that the deceased is a vulnerable victim as a cyclist should not necessarily be considered as an aggravating factor against the accused or that the accused should, as a rule be punished more harshly.

194    As held by the High Court in _Hue An Li_ at \[79\]-\[80\], much depends on the precise facts of the case. The two reasons cited by the High Court are as follows:

> \[79\]  First, singling out vulnerable classes could result in double-counting where the Prosecution has framed the charge(s) by reference to the harm actually caused. Vulnerable classes are, by definition, those who are more susceptible to injury. A collision with a member of a vulnerable class is inherently more likely to result in hurt, grievous hurt or death. In this regard, the Penal Code, as a matter of law, provides for harsher punishment if greater harm is caused (see e.g., the table set out at \[71\] above). An offender who collides into a member of a vulnerable class would thus already have a higher chance of falling into a harsher band of punishment, and there is no reasons to doubly punish such an offender by enhancing his sentence on the grounds that his victim is a vulnerable victim.

> \[80\]  Second, singling out classes as vulnerable might well result in wasteful litigation over whether a particular class ought to be recognised as vulnerable. The law is ill-equipped to draw invidious lines between road users…. It seems untenable to make such assessments when all lives should be held to be equally precious in the eyes of the law.

195    Pertinently, a collision with a vulnerable victim is more likely to result in greater harm. This can be apparent in the present case where although the accused has a lower culpability than the accused in _Cullen_, he is charged for a more serious offence and is likely to receive a higher sentence because of the greater harm caused to the victim in this case who was a cyclist. The victim in _Cullen_ was not a vulnerable victim as he was driving a motorcar at the material time. To avoid the issue of double counting, the various provisions in the new RTA now provides for harsher punishment if more serious harm is caused.

196    As for whether a particular class ought to be recognised as vulnerable, I agree with the High Court in _Hue An Li_ that it may not be justifiable to make such an assessment. For example, for cyclists there may be amateur or social cyclists who ride the basic mountain bikes. On the other hand, there are experienced or professional cyclists who ride racing bikes which are more performance enhancing and can travel at a faster speed. Such a distinction may not be easily drawn in many cases.

##### Offender-specific factors: The accused’s personal circumstances

197    I am in general agreement with both the Prosecution and Defence on the mitigating factors in this case. The accused is untraced and has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity as a sign of his remorse. He has co-operated fully with the authorities. There is no issue of restitution here as any claims arising from the accident are covered by the relevant motor insurance.

198    In view of the mitigating factors in favour of the accused, both the Prosecution and Defence agreed that there should be a downward adjustment on the duration of the sentence.

199    The Prosecution submitted that a downward adjustment of one to two months (i.e. from 13 to 14 months’ imprisonment) to 12 months’ imprisonment is appropriate here.

200    The Defence submitted a downward adjustment of one month (i.e. from the higher end of the sentence range of up to 4 months’ imprisonment) to 3 months’ imprisonment.

201    Based on the proposed sentencing framework, the applicable indicative sentencing range would be 6 to 12 months’ imprisonment. However, as mentioned earlier, because the accused was driving a heavy vehicle, the starting point within the indicative sentencing range should be at the higher end of the range for an accused who claims trial. I agree with both parties that a downward adjustment of up to 1 to 2 months is reasonable when an accused pleads guilty.

202    All things considered, having regard to all the evidence as a whole, as the accused has pleaded guilty, I adjust the sentence to 9 months’ imprisonment with the minimum specified period for the DQAC at eight (8) years from the date of release.

## Conclusion

203    Driving a motor vehicle comes with the responsibility of exercising due care, attention and caution as well as showing reasonable consideration for other road users. Such a responsibility should not be taken lightly. At the same time, even for road users who have the right of way, it is still important to exercise care and caution. It is better to be safe than sorry. Serious accidents of such nature may be avoided if we have greater patience and show more grace when on the roads. Every road user has a role to play to keep our roads safe for us and our families. A little less haste, a little more alertness will go a long way in reducing traffic accidents.

204    To summarise, the accused is accordingly sentenced as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="30%"> <col width="21.22%"> <col width="48.78%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence Ordered</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-915483-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 65(1)(b) p/u s65(2)(a) r/w s65(6) RTA</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Nine (9) months'</b> imprisonment with effect from <b>4 September 2020</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of <b>eight (8) years</b> with effect from date of release, and prohibited under s 47F RTA from driving any motor vehicle in Singapore for a period of <b>eight (8) years</b> with effect from date of release.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

205    The accused has been remanded since 4 September 2020. I therefore backdate his sentence to commence from the date of his remand.

206    As the accused is a foreigner, I give a prohibition order pursuant to s 47F of the RTA from driving any motor vehicle in Singapore for the same period as the disqualification order imposed.

207    It leaves me to thank both the Prosecution and Defence for their invaluable assistance on this matter.
