22 July 2019

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Part 1   Charge, Sentence and Appeal

1       The Accused and one Ramalingam Andavarselvam (“the Victim”) are foreign nationals. In December 2017, both of them and several other foreign workers were staying in the same room (“the room”) at the workers’ dormitory at PPT Lodge 1A, located at 8 Seletar North Link, Singapore. On 27 December 2017, the Accused and the Victim had a work-related dispute which escalated into a fight. After investigations were completed, the Accused was charged in court.

2       The charge against the Accused was:

> You, … …, Male/31, … …, Indian National, are charged that you, on 27 December 2017, between 9.00 p.m. and 9.29 p.m., at PPT Lodge 1A, located at 8 Seletar North Link, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Ramalingam Andavarselvam with an instrument which is likely to cause death when used as a weapon of offence, _to wit_, by using a hockey stick to hit him at least once on the left side of his upper back, causing him to suffer pain and a 10 x 5cm contusion over his left scapula, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

3       The Accused claimed trial to the said charge. At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him. After hearing the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment.

4       The Accused was dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence. He has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. The Accused’s application to stay the execution of imprisonment was granted. Bail pending appeal was set at $20,000. However, the Accused could not find a surety to bail him and he commenced serving the sentence on 10 June 2019.

## Part 2   Brief Outline of the Case for the Prosecution

5       It was the Prosecution’s case that on the night of 27 December 2017, the Victim and the Accused had an argument. They were the only persons inside the room. Arising from the argument, the Accused slapped the Victim. The Accused then punched the Victim once over his right eye. A fight ensued. The Accused used a hockey stick and the Victim used a bucket. The Accused managed to land two blows with the hockey stick onto the Victim’s left upper back.

6       The Prosecution’s case rested primarily on the evidence of:

> (a)     the Victim;

> (b)     Dr Namthep Sachathep (“Dr Namthep”), who has examined the Victim at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“KTPH”); and

> (c)     Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Farid Bin Kamis (“SSSgt Muhammad Farid”) and Sergeant Koh Jing Li (“Sgt Koh”), who were the first Police Officers to attend to the case.

7       The Prosecution tendered the Victim’s Medical Report (Exhibit P1), the Victim’s A & E Visit Summary sheet (Exhibit P2), the First Information Report (Exhibit P3) and an Arrest cum Seizure report (Exhibit P4) in support of the evidence of the Victim, Dr Namthep and the first Police Officers.

8       The hockey stick (Exhibit P5), used by the Accused during the assault, was found and seized by the Police. The said hockey stick was produced at the trial. A photograph of the said hockey stick, measuring about 94 cm, was also tendered (Exhibit P16). The Prosecution also adduced a CCTV footage (Exhibit P6) which captured the Victim holding a white bucket and the Accused chasing the Victim along the corridor of level 1 of the dormitory subsequently. The Accused could be seen in the CCTV footage wielding the said hockey stick and attempting to hit the Victim with it.

## Part 3   Brief Outline of the Case for the Defence

9       It was the Accused’s defence that the Victim has attacked him with a plastic bucket. In defending himself from the Victim’s attack, the Accused used his hands to block the bucket which was aimed at him. In blocking the bucket, the bucket broke. One of the pieces from the broken bucket flew and hit the Victim at his face. The Victim then picked up another bucket and attacked the Accused with it. The Accused went to the back of the room and picked up a hockey stick. The Victim then retreated backward and in so doing, he hit against the edge of the dormitory’s room door, which was open. The Victim fell. The Victim got up and ran out of the dormitory room with the Accused in pursuit. During the pursuit of the Victim along the corridor of the dormitory, the Accused swung the hockey stick at the Victim, but no contact was made between the hockey stick and any part of the Victim’s body. The Accused stopped chasing after the Victim when the Victim ran down the staircase towards the ground floor.

10     In summary, the Accused denied punching the Victim over his eye, and that the Victim’s injuries on his left upper back were neither inflicted nor caused by him with the hockey stick.

## Part 4   Assessment of the Evidence

11     In this Part, I shall first set out the background facts to this case. This will be followed by the respective accounts of the Victim and the Accused of a fight between the two of them. I will then provide my assessment of the evidence before rounding up the facts with the evidence of the Investigation Officer.

### A.   Background Facts - Events during the journey back to the dormitory

### (i)   The Victim’s Account

12     In the evening of 27 December 2017, at about 6 p.m., the Victim and his colleagues, namely, Veera, Stalin, Rajan and Bala were waiting for the company’s van to come and pick them up. The company’s van would be bringing them back to their dormitory at PPT Lodge 1A.

13     The van arrived around 7:30 p.m. The van driver was the Accused.

14     The Victim, Veera, Rajan and Bala boarded the van. They were joined inside the van by two other colleagues, namely, Siva and Mannan. Stalin did not board the van because about five minutes before the van’s arrival, he went to the washroom.

15     Siva and Bala sat at the front of the van, next to the Accused. The rest sat at the rear of the van.

16     The Accused, being aware that Stalin has not boarded the van, asked the Victim to make a call to Stalin. Veera, Mannan and the Victim all made separate calls to Stalin, but none of them could reach Stalin. His line appeared to have been disconnected. The Accused did not want to wait for Stalin and drove the van away.

17     When the van entered the highway, the Victim received a call from Stalin. Stalin wanted to know why the van did not wait for him. The Victim told Stalin that he should ask the driver of the van. Stalin then terminated the call.

18     The Victim testified that the Accused then asked him whether Stalin has taken a taxi and whether Stalin has reached the dormitory. After a while, the Accused asked the Victim whether Stalin has taken a bus back to the dormitory. The Victim did not give any response to either of the questions. The Accused asked the Victim a third time and his question was whether Stalin has taken a train back to the dormitory. On this occasion, the Victim replied “_No, Stalin took an aeroplane and it landed in his dormitory._” According to the Victim, he felt that the Accused was not being serious when he had asked him about the whereabouts of Stalin, and that was the reason behind him giving such an answer to the Accused’s third question.

19     Upon arrival at the workers’ dormitory, the Victim bought a cup of coffee and sat at the stone bench near the security post to drink the coffee. The Victim then received a call from Stalin. In their conversation, both of them agreed that after Stalin’s return to the dormitory, they would go out for dinner. The Victim then returned to his room and went to take a shower.

20     After taking his shower, the Victim returned to his room. Veera and the Accused was inside the room. Veera left the room. Shortly thereafter, the Accused came over to confront him.

### (ii)   The Accused’s Account

21     When the Accused realised that one person has not boarded the van, he asked the Victim and Siva, _“\[w\]here is the missing person ?_”. The reply given to him was that they did not know the whereabouts of the “missing person”. He then asked everyone whether he should wait for the “missing person”. Everyone agreed to wait for ten minutes. After ten minutes has passed, there was still no sign of the “missing person”. So, he drove the van away.

22     While the van was travelling on the highway, the “missing person” called the Victim. The Accused asked whether he should make a U-turn and return to pick up the “missing person”. No one responded to his question. He was able to sense that the Victim, Mannan and “Gia” were engaged in a deep conversation, but he did not know what they were discussing. So, the Accused sought the help of Siva to ask the rest whether he should return to fetch the “missing person” or just head back to the dormitory. When no one inside the van gave any reply to Siva, the Accused decided to continue with the journey back to the dormitory.

23     Back at dormitory, the Accused went to take his shower. After taking his shower, he returned to the room. He noticed that the Victim has taken his shower and has returned to the room as well. The Accused then approached the Victim.

### B.   The Fight - Events inside the dormitory room which led to a fight

### (i)   The Victim’s Account

24     The Victim testified that after he has taken his shower, he returned to the room. The Accused, who has already taken his shower, was inside the room and changing. Veera was also inside the room then. Veera then left the room leaving only the Victim and the Accused inside the room.

25     The Accused approached the Victim. The Victim was asked by the Accused why, during the journey in the van, he had spoken in such a manner when answering his questions. The Accused said that the Victim had gone overboard; he had exceeded his limit. The Victim replied that he has answered the Accused in a joking manner because the Accused has spoken in a joking manner in the first place. The Accused then told the Victim that he did not like it. This was followed immediately by the Accused giving the Victim a slap.

26     The Victim reacted by asking the Accused why he had slapped him and wanted to know the reason. The Victim also said that the Accused would have to answer for his action of slapping him. The Accused responded by saying “_You dare talk back to me?_” The Accused then punched the Victim over the eye. The Victim could not remember which eye was punched.

27     The Accused went to take a hockey stick. When the Victim realised this, he picked up a red plastic bucket from the corner of the room. The Victim made a marking “X” on photograph Exhibit P13 to indicate his position when he picked up the red plastic bucket. The Accused approached the Victim and swung the hockey stick at him. The Victim used the red plastic bucket to shield himself. On impact, the force exerted on the hockey stick broke the red plastic bucket. The Victim dropped the broken red plastic bucket and picked up a white plastic bucket which was just nearby.

28     The Victim used the white plastic bucket to swing at the Accused because the Accused was trying to aim and hit the Victim with the hockey stick. At this point in time, the Victim was standing outside the room. The Victim swung the white plastic bucket when the Accused tried to hit him with the hockey stick. As he swung the white plastic bucket, he stepped back into the room. The Victim then dropped the white plastic bucket and tried to run out of the room. The Victim described that as he was turning away from the Accused, the Accused managed to strike him on his left upper back with the hockey stick. The Victim was unable to tell how much force was used by the Accused but the hurt caused was very painful.

29     When the Victim was trying to run away from the Accused, he felt a second strike on his left upper back. The Victim felt the hockey stick hitting him on his back and was sliding on his back. The second strike resulted in “_normal slight pain_”. It was not as painful as the first blow struck by the Accused.

30     On photograph Exhibit P24, the Victim made the marks “X” and “Y” to indicate the positions on his left upper back which the hockey stick had struck the first and second blows respectively.

31     The Victim was shown the CCTV footage (Exhibit P6). When shown several portions of the CCTV footage (Exhibit P6), the Victim explained:

> Notes of Evidence: Day 3 – Page 31 at L24 to L28

>   
| 

Witness :

 | 

At the first instance, when---the accused was trying to hit me, if you see from very far, I swing----I swung the bucket. And there was another attempt where I swung the bucket because the accused came towards to hit me and when I tried to go towards the room inside, and that’s when I got hit first.

 |

  
  

> Notes of Evidence: Day 3 – Page 32 at L12 to L24

>   
| 

Witness :

 | 

… when the accused was trying to hit me with the hockey stick, that’s when I swung the bucket in the 1st instance of the video. That’s---that’s being shown, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Court :

 | 

Yes, then?

 |
| 

Witness :

 | 

And this---there will be another portion of this video where I swung the bucket the 2nd time because the accused was walking towards me to hit me with the hockey stick and I went towards the room---I went inside the room when he---the accused person raised his hockey stick to hit me, that’s when I drop the bucket and I made a point to run away and that was the first time that the hockey stick was used to hit me on my back, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

> Notes of Evidence: Day 3 – Page 46 at L22 to L25

>   
| 

Witness :

 | 

The reason why I can be seen in the video outside is because when I went outside you provoked me and you said “Why are you going away? Come inside. Come and hit me. Try me.”

 |

  
  

> Notes of Evidence: Day 3 – Page 52 at L4 to L12

>   
| 

Witness :

 | 

Your Honour, if you---if you play the video. You’ll be able to see me having the white bucket still in my hand, Your Honour. I swung it the first time then after that he asked me, why am I swinging it from outside? If I dare come in and he provoked me and when I---when I go forward into the room, Your Honour. That’s when he waved with the hockey stick the 2nd time and he hit my back and that’s when he got so angry at me. He raised the hockey stick and started to chase me.

 |

  
  

### (ii)   The Accused’s Account

32     The Accused testified in his evidence-in-chief that he approached the Victim and asked him in a friendly manner “_What happened to the missing person? Is everything okay?_” He asked several times but the Victim did not respond. The Victim looked very angry to him. The Victim said angrily “_Do I look like a mental or mad person to you or does everybody thinking of me as a mad person?_”

33     The version given by the Accused when he was cross-examining the Victim was different. The Accused’s version put to the Victim was that he has asked “_Why was there no response to any of my questions earlier?_” The Victim “_got angry and he used his hand gestures and asked if I am mad_”.

34     Arising from the above exchange, the Accused claimed that he then lightly tapped the cheek of the Victim with his right hand.

35     The Victim got angry and picked up a bucket. The Victim went towards the Accused and tried to hit the Accused with the bucket. The Accused blocked with his left hand. The bucket broke. A broken piece from the broken bucket hit the Victim’s face. The Accused then went on to give the following account:

> Notes of Evidence: Day 4 – Page 9 at L23 to L26 and L28 to L30

> Accused :... … And I went forward towards him and behind him was the door, the ledge of the door, Your Honour. He lost balance. He hit on the ledge and he fell to the ground.

> Accused :Your Honour, the door was pretty open. It was at the corner of the door that he actually he hit and he fell. It was a sharper position, Your Honour. Sharper---

> Notes of Evidence: Day 4 – Page 10 at L4 to L6

> Accused :Your Honour, it’s ---he---he fell, but he hit and he fell back on the---when the door was opened, at the part where we actually hold the knob. That corner, Your Honour. The edge, Your Honour.

> Notes of Evidence : Day 4 – Page 10 at L13 to L23

> Accused :And he got up. There was a bucket next to him. He picked that bucket and he hit me with that bucket. He took that bucket and he was out of the room and he keep coming forward and swinging and hitting me with the bucket. I blocked that hit with both my hands and that bucket material was very thick. It was causing a lot of pain in my hand and I couldn’t bear the pain. And then I walked to the---to the room, the inner part of the room, Your Honour, to retrieve the hockey stick. While I was walking to the inside of the room to take the hockey stick, he kept scolding me, he kept using words on me.

36     The Accused took the hockey stick and then walked towards the entrance of the room, where the Victim was. The Victim then fled from the room.

37     The Accused testified that when he took the hockey stick his intention was “_just wanted to scare him_”. The Accused admitted chasing after the Victim. However, he claimed that he did not have the intention to hurt the Victim.

38     After the Victim has managed to get away from him, the Accused went back to the room. He was in the room for a while before going to have dinner.

39     The Accused’s defence has been that he did not use the hockey stick to hit the Victim on his back.

### (iii)   The Accused’s defence witness

40     The Accused called one Shanramohan Dhanamohan (“Mohan”) as a defence witness. Mohan is a foreign worker who was also staying at the same workers’ dormitory as the Accused. They got to know each other from doing gym activities at the gym located on the ground floor of the dormitory block where the Accused and the Victim were staying.

41     According to Mohan, on the night of the incident, when he was doing exercises at the gym, he heard a commotion. He then came out from the gym to find out what was going on. From his position at the ground floor and looking up to the corridor where the Accused’s room was, he saw the Accused chasing after the Victim with a hockey stick. During the chase, the Accused raised the hockey stick in order to strike at the Victim, but no contact was made.

42     It was clear to the court that Mohan’s evidence did not assist the Accused in his defence because Mohan did not witness any of the events that had transpired inside the Accused’s room. No weight was thus given to Mohan’s evidence.

### (iv)   First Information Report (“FIR”)

43     The Victim testified that after he fled from the Accused’s pursuit, he ran to the security post at the workers’ dormitory. The security officer was unhelpful and in the end, he had to call the Police himself. Indeed, the FIR (Exhibit P3) showed that the caller to the Police’s “999” hotline was one “Mr Selvam” (“Selvam” being the short-form reference to the Victim’s name “Andavarselvam”). The Victim has testified that he was the subscriber to the telephone number “XXX” that was stated on the FIR. In the FIR, the message was recorded as “_Someone hit me. I hurt my eye_.”

### (v)   Evidence of the First Police Officers

44     SSSgt Muhammad Farid and Sgt Koh were the first Police Officers that went to the workers’ dormitory to attend to the case. They were informed of the FIR by their station’s Operations Room.

45     SSSgt Muhammad Farid testified that the Victim approached them when they were at the security post of the workers’ dormitory. The Victim then made the complaint that he has been punched in the eye and hit on the back area with a hockey stick. The Victim further said that he had an argument with a co-worker and that it was this co-worker who had punched him in the eye. Sgt Koh’s testimony was that the Victim was holding one of his eyes and complaining of pain. The Victim also complained of pain on his shoulder. They then arranged for an ambulance to go over to the workers’ dormitory. The ambulance came. The Victim was handed over to the ambulance officer. SSSgt Muhammad Farid and Sgt Koh then went to the dormitory room to look for the co-worker whom the Victim alleged to have assaulted him. They did not find the alleged assailant at the dormitory room. With the help of other foreign workers, the alleged assailant turned up. The alleged assailant was the Accused. The Accused was interviewed and the Accused claimed that he had an argument with the Victim regarding some work issues. All of a sudden, the Victim took a bucket and swing it towards the Accused. The Accused dodged it and then took up a hockey stick placed near his roommate’s bed. The Accused claimed that he did swing the hockey stick at the Victim but did not strike the Victim with the hockey stick. SSSgt Muhammad Farid found the hockey stick in the dormitory room and seized it. The seizure of the hockey stick was documented in Exhibit P4.

46     SSSgt Muhammad Farid and Sgt Koh later found that there was a CCTV camera covering the corridor outside of the incident location. SSSgt Muhammad Farid and Sgt Koh checked with the dormitory’s security office and managed to view the relevant CCTV footage which captured the Accused chasing after the Victim along the corridor.

47     SSSgt Muhammad Farid reported his findings to his supervisor and was instructed to call the Investigating Officer. SSSgt Muhammad Farid could not remember whether it was him or his partner, Sgt Koh, who could have briefed IO Shareyzan Bin Shamsudin (_“IO Shareyzan”_), the Investigating Officer, on this case.

### (vi)   Medical Report on the Victim

48     The Victim was conveyed by ambulance to KTPH.

49     At the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of KTPH, the Victim was first triaged by Senior Staff Nurse Syarifah Dian Irdayu (“SSN Syarifah”), before being referred for medical examination by Dr Namthep. In the triage notes kept by SSN Syarifah, it was documented that the Victim had complained of being assaulted by a hockey stick over the left upper back and there was blurring of vision on his right eye. The triage notes also documented that there was swelling over the left upper back with pain radiating to the left arm and redness over the right eye. SSN Syarifah’s triage notes of the Victim can be found in the A & E Visit Summary sheet (Exhibit P2).

50     After triage, the Victim was medically examined by Dr Namthep. Dr Namthep’s notes of his medical examination of the Victim can also be found in the A & E Visit Summary sheet (Exhibit P2).

51     At the trial, Dr Namthep explained that he documented the complaints of the Victim: see Exhibit P2 at the sub-header “PC” which stands for “Presenting Complaints”. The Victim complained of pain over the left scapular (_i.e._ the wing bone at the back behind the left shoulder) and pain over the right eye with initial blurring of vision which has resolved by the time Dr Namthep examined him. The pain was due to the Victim being hit over the upper back and punched over the right eye. That a weapon was used was noted by Dr Namthep. Dr Namthep testified that he did not ask the Victim to describe the weapon. Instead, he relied on the information (_i.e._ a hockey stick being the weapon used) provided by the Victim to SSN Syarifah.

52     Regarding his examination of the Victim, Dr Namthep found the right eye conjunctiva to be slightly injected. This meant that the superficial layer of the eye was slightly red. In respect of the injury on the Victim’s left upper back, Dr Namthep found a 10 cm by 5 cm contusion but there was no tenderness along the bone. According to Dr Namthep, a contusion means a bruise or injury to the soft tissue underneath the skin. Both the eye and back injuries were visible to Dr Namthep. Dr Namthep referred the Victim to the radiology department for an X-ray to be done. The X-ray result showed no fracture on the Victim’s left scapular contusion.

53     Dr Namthep’s diagnosis of the Victim’s injuries was one of contusion secondary to assault. The Victim was discharged with medical leave for two days and given a referral to a polyclinic for follow-up: see Medical Report of the Victim (Exhibit P1).

54     Under cross-examination, Dr Namthep opined that it is possible for a patient to suffer a contusion on his back if the patient was to move backward and knocked against the edge of a door. However, the Accused did not seek further clarification from Dr Namthep whether the particular contusion that was found on the Victim could have been caused by the Victim falling on his back against the edge of a door. Dr Namthep also testified under cross-examination that it was possible for a broken piece (from the bucket) to cause some form of blunt trauma at the eye. But in Dr Namthep’s opinion, the Victim’s eye injury was more likely to be caused by a punch.

55     The most significant aspect of Dr Namthep’s evidence was that the diagnosis – contusion secondary to assault – was consistent with the manner of assault and injury as described by the Victim. Dr Namthep’e evidence remained unscathed after the cross-examination by the Accused.

56     Dr Namthep is a neutral and independent witness in this case. I found that Dr Namthep has given his testimony objectively without favouring the Victim.

57     I accepted Dr Namthep’s testimony. In my judgment, Dr Namthep’s evidence was corroborative of the Victim’s account that he has been punched on his right eye and hit on his left upper back by a hockey stick.

### (vii)   The CCTV Footage (Exhibit P6)

58     The CCTV footage (Exhibit P6) is an objective piece of evidence that proved that a fight had indeed taken place inside the room, and that portion of the fight then spilled out onto the corridor, just in front of the doorway. The material portions of the CCTV footage (Exhibit P6) are described in the table below.

### C.   Court’s Evaluation of the Evidence and Court’s Findings on the Credibility of the Victim and the Accused.

59     In my evaluation of the evidence, I found the Victim to be a truthful and credible witness. I believed and accepted his account of the events.

60     In respect of the events that have taken place during the journey back to the dormitory, I found that it was the Accused who has made the final decision not to wait for Stalin because he was the driver of the van and has full control over the van. The Accused’s decision to drive off without Stalin resulted in some form of unhappiness between the Accused and the Victim. In so far as the Victim was concerned, he did not seek out the Accused. After arriving at the dormitory, the Victim bought a cup of coffee and sat at the stone bench near the security post to drink the coffee. It was the Accused who could not get over the incident. After the Accused has taken a shower and seeing that the Victim was also in the room, the Accused approached and confronted the Victim. It bears highlighting that the Accused did not confront the Victim over his (i.e. the Accused’s) decision not to wait for Stalin. Rather, the Accused confronted the Victim on account of his perception that the Victim has been disrespectful to him when responding to his questions regarding the whereabouts of Stalin. And it was the Accused who first laid hands on the Victim by slapping the Victim. I believed the Victim’s account of the events.

61     With regards to the incident of the fight and the use of the hockey stick by the Accused, I found that the Victim has been consistent in his narrative – in the FIR; to the first Police Officers; to SSN Syarifah (as documented in Exhibit P2) and to Dr Namthep. Most importantly, the Victim’s account of how he was attacked and injured by the Accused, both on the right eye and his left upper back, was corroborated by the evidence of Dr Namthep.

62     When the Victim was shown the CCTV footage (Exhibit P6), he was forthcoming and admitted to using a white plastic bucket to swing at the Accused. The Victim has also admitted to his role in the fight with the Accused. The Victim has provided an account, parts of which are reproduced verbatim at \[31\] above, which is consistent with the CCTV footage.

63     On the contrary, I disbelieved the Accused’s account of the events. The Accused has painted a picture of himself being the victim of an assault. But the evidence does not support his defence at all. Here are my reasons for disbelieving the Accused.

> (a)     (1)Firstly, with regards to the Victim hitting himself against the edge of the door, it was clear from the Accused’s evidence-in-chief that the Victim hit against the door and fell **_inside_** the room. The door of the room can be found in photograph, Exhibit P13. This photograph was taken from inside the room. If one were to open the door (as shown in Exhibit P13), the door would open inwards (i.e. into the room itself). And my observation is clearly supported by photograph, Exhibit P8. However, during the cross-examination of the Victim, the Accused provided a different version which is reproduced below:

>> Notes of Evidence: Day 3 – Page 43 at L3 to L7

>> Q :Your Honour, if you watched the video, you will be able to see that **_you fell back_**, **_you got up_**, **_you came inside_**, you took the white bucket and you hit me on my hand area. It was very painful, till then I did not take the hockey stick, do you agree?

>> (Emphasis in bold and italics made by me)

> (a)     (2)I have seen the CCTV footage (Exhibit P6) several times when it was played in court during the trial. I have also watched the said CCTV footage (Exhibit P6) on my own during my review and evaluation of the evidence. I have observed that the Victim was already holding onto a white bucket when he was first seen standing outside of the room. At all times when the Victim was seen outside of the room (as shown in the CCTV footage), he was always standing. The Accused’s version was inconsistent with the objective evidence, _i.e._ the CCTV footage (Exhibit P6).

> (a)     (3)It was a very important aspect of the Accused’s defence whether the Victim has hit against the door and **_inside_** the room or **_outside_** the room. That the Accused has got this aspect completely wrong or different has cast doubt on his credibility.

> (b)     Secondly, the Accused claimed that he suffered much pain after using his hands to block the bucket and that the plastic bucket broke. The Victim then picked up another bucket and continued with his attack. The Accused used both his hands to ward off the bucket and it caused him a lot of pain. The Accused has testified that he couldn’t bear the pain. Yet, he did not seek any medical treatment. No evidence was adduced by the Accused to support his defence that he has suffered injury from the alleged attack by the Victim. I have observed that when the Accused stopped chasing the Victim, he did not appear to be in pain. I disbelieved the Accused’s account that the Victim has used two different buckets to attack him.

> (c)     Thirdly, the Accused claimed that he had picked up the hockey stick in order to scare the Victim. But such a self-proclaimed intention was clearly at odds with the objective evidence of the CCTV footage (Exhibit P6) (see \[58(7)\] above) showing that he had attempted twice to hit the Victim with the hockey stick whilst chasing the Victim along the corridor. The Accused have already achieved his objective when the Victim ran away from him. There was no necessity to attempt to strike the Victim with the hockey stick, unless that had been his intention from the beginning.

64     In his closing submission, the Accused repeated his defence that when he went to take the hockey stick, the Victim was outside the door. From that distance, he could not possibly strike the Victim with the hockey stick. When he went towards the Victim, the Victim ran away. The objective evidence from the CCTV footage (Exhibit P6) has completely demolished the said submission.

65     In my judgment, I found the Accused’s defence to be totally unmeritorious and I rejected it.

### D.   Investigation Officer’s Evidence

66     I shall now round up the facts with a short account of the Investigation Officer’s evidence.

67     The Investigation Officer for this case was IO Shareyzan. He did not interview the Victim on the day of the incident. When IO Shareyzan arrived at the workers’ dormitory, the Victim has already been conveyed by ambulance to the hospital. IO Shareyzan testified that he was given the brief facts of the case by SSSgt Muhammad Farid at the scene. IO Shareyzan conducted preliminary investigations at the dormitory and directed photographs of the scene to be taken (see Exhibits P7 – P15).

68     IO Shareyzan returned to the dormitory a second time – this was on 28 December 2017. The dormitory’s security office downloaded the relevant CCTV footage onto a thumb-drive. Back at the police station, IO Shareyzan transferred the relevant CCTV footage from the thumb-drive onto his laptop. Subsequently, he received the assistance of an officer from the station’s Cybercrime Unit to burn a CD-ROM of the relevant CCTV footage. The said CD-ROM was then produced in court as Exhibit P6.

69     IO Shareyzan interviewed the Victim on 29 December 2017. On the same day, he directed Home Team Specialist Sheida Barten Hancock (PW6) to take several photographs of the Victim (see Exhibits P17 – 24). The purpose was to show the injuries sustained by the Victim on his right eye and his left upper back. I found that the said photographs were not helpful in the assessment of the evidence for two reasons. Firstly, the Victim’s right eye appeared normal from the photograph (see photographs Exhibit P17 and Exhibit P18) and the redness that was observed in the Victim’s right eye on 27 December 2017 appeared to have resolved by 29 December 2017. Secondly, the 10 x 5 cm contusion found by Dr Namthep’s medical examination were not visible from any of the photographs showing the back of the Victim.

70     IO Shareyzan testified that the Victim was not charged in court for his part in the fight with the Accused. Instead, the Victim was administered with a Stern Warning for an offence of Voluntarily Causing Hurt (“VCH”). The Accused was the victim of the said VCH offence.

71     IO Shareyzan has made arrangement for the Victim to give his testimony during the first tranche (_i.e._ 20 – 21 March 2019) of the trial. The Victim did not turn up on 20 – 21 March 2019. The Victim was in communications with IO Shareyzan though. IO Shareyzan told the court that the Victim has encountered a visa issue which prevented him from entering Singapore. At the second tranche (_i.e._ 29 – 30 March 2019) of the trial, the Victim explained in court that he had bought a ticket and travelled from India to Singapore for the first tranche of the trial. However, at Changi Airport, he was informed that he did not have the requisite visa to enter Singapore. The Victim then contacted IO Shareyzan to inform of his situation and IO Shareyzan then told him that the date for him to attend court has been changed. The Victim felt that he has wasted one trip. Nonetheless, he made a second trip to Singapore and gave his oral testimony in court on 29 and 30 April 2019.

### E.   Summary of the Court’s findings of facts

72     Upon a careful consideration and evaluation of the evidence, I found:

> (a)     That, on the evening of 27 December 2017, during the journey in the van back to the dormitory, the Accused was displeased with the manners and attitude of the Victim. The Accused felt that the Victim has been disrespectful to him;

> (b)     Inside the dormitory room, the Accused approached and confronted the Victim over the disrespect displayed (see \[60\] above) by the Victim;

> (c)     There was an argument between the Accused and the Victim;

> (d)     The Accused slapped the Victim;

> (e)     The Accused punched the Victim once over the Victim’s right eye;

> (f)     The Accused picked up a hockey stick and the Victim picked up a red plastic bucket. The Accused broke the red plastic bucket with a swing of the hockey stick.

> (g)     The Victim then picked up a white plastic bucket and used it to fight with the Accused;

> (h)     The Victim turned to get away from the Accused. As the Victim was turning his body away from the Accused, the Accused managed to land a blow with the hockey stick onto the Victim’s left upper back;

> (i)     After having turned towards the door in order to get away from the Accused, the Victim was hit with another blow from the hockey stick;

> (j)     Wielding the hockey stick, the Accused chased after the Victim along the corridor and made two unsuccessful attempts to hit the Victim with the hockey stick; and

> (k)     The Accused stopped chasing the Victim when the Victim reached the staircase and managed to get away by running down the staircase.

73     I found that the hockey stick (Exhibit P5) is an instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death. I also found that the Accused was aware that the hockey stick when used as a weapon of offence could cause serious injuries or death.

## Part 5   Conviction

74     I was thus satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused accordingly.

75     I now turn to address the issue of sentence.

## Part 6   Antecedent

76     The Accused was untraced for any criminal antecedent.

## Part 7   Sentence

### A.   Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

77     Adopting the sentencing methodology of the dichotomy of harm/injury and culpability enunciated in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span>, the Prosecution sought a sentence of at least three months’ imprisonment.

78     At the first stage of the sentencing analysis which is based on the harm/injury sustained by the Victim, the Prosecution submitted that the indicative starting sentence should be an imprisonment of two months.

79     At the second stage of the sentencing analysis which is based on culpability, the Prosecution argued that the circumstances surrounding the attack on the Victim and the Accused’s culpability warranted an uplift of an additional one month’s imprisonment. The Prosecution highlighted that:

> (a)     the Accused has hit the Victim twice with the hockey stick;

> (b)     the large amount of force used by the Accused in swinging the hockey stick at the Victim has caused a plastic bucket to break apart upon contact between the hockey stick and the plastic bucket; and

> (c)     two further attempts were made to hit the Victim with the hockey stick when the Accused was chasing after the Victim along the dormitory corridor.

80     The Prosecution also submitted that the usual sentencing discount for a plea of guilt would not be applicable as the Accused has elected to contest the charge.

81     The Prosecution further submitted that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment in the present case would be in line with the cases of _Public Prosecutor v Nedunzheiyan Chitrarasan_ (Unreported, DAC 900894/2017) (_“Nedunzheiyan”_) and _Public Prosecutor v Monir Late Chand Miah_ (Unreported, DAC 34527/2011) (_“Monir_”). Both cases featured construction workers as the offenders and victims, almost similar to our present case. In _Nedunzheiyan_, the offender used a piece of wood (68 x 5 cm) to hit the victim’s head a few times. The offender has struck when the victim was walking away. The victim suffered three scalp lacerations on the head. The offender pleaded guilty to an offence under s 324 PC and was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment. In _Monir_, the offender used a hammer to strike the victim on his shoulder. The offender was disarmed by his supervisor. The victim sustained an undisplaced acromion process fracture without dislocation. The offender pleaded guilty to an offence under s 324 PC and was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment.

### B.   Mitigation Plea

82     The Accused sought leniency on sentence. He asked for the lightest possible sentence as he wished to return to India as soon as this case was over.

### C.   Sentence Imposed

83     I gave no weight to the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution. Sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations should bear little weight, if any, because they are unreasoned. Such decisions had to be approached with caution. See _Janardana Jayasankarr v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1288</span> at \[13(b)\]. See also _Yap Ah Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span> at \[39\] and _Keeping Mark John v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 627</span> at \[18\].

84     In my judgment, I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions at \[78\] to \[80\] above. On the issue of culpability, I found the Accused to be the main aggressor during the fight. The Accused has not exhibited any discernible remorse. I agree with the Prosecution that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was an adequate sentence. Thus, I meted out a sentence of three months’ imprisonment on the Accused.
