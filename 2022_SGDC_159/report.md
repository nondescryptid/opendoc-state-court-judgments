Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Statutory Offences – Road Traffic Act – Disqualification Order

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9130/2022/01.\]

29 July 2022

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Ms Fitriah Binti Osman, a 25 year-old female Singapore citizen faced the following charge:

Charge

> are charged that you, on 1st August 2021 at or about 7.02 p.m, at the non-signalized T-junction of West Coast Crescent by West Coast Link, Singapore, did drive a motor car, SJJ6078R, on a road without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, to wit, by failing to give way to traffic with right of way when making a right turn from a minor road into a major road, resulting in a collision with a motorcycle, JGL9283 that was proceeding straight from your right to left direction along the major road, and hurt was caused to one, Bhaskaran A/L Ponapalam (Male/43 years old), and by such driving, you have thereby committed an offence under Section 65(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276, punishable under Section 65(4)(a) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

2       On 6 July 2022, the accused pleaded guilty to the charge and admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification. After carefully considering the accused’s plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $2,000 in default 7 days’ imprisonment and disqualified her from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 15 months with effect from 6 July 2022.

3       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed a Notice of Appeal against my order of disqualification on 7 July 2022. She has paid an initial sum of $500 towards the fine and is to pay the balance in instalments of $500 per month from 10 August 2022 and thereafter on the 10th of the subsequent months. The disqualification order is effective from 6 July 2022 to 5 October 2023 as the filing of the appeal does not suspend the operation of this order. To date, no order has been made in respect of the suspension of the payment of the fine as well as the disqualification order.

4       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

5       The accused was the driver of motorcar, SJJ6078R at the time of accident. The victim is Bhaskaran a/l Ponapalam, male, Indian, Malaysian, 43 years old. He was the rider of motorcycle, JGL9283 at the time of accident.

6       On 1 August 2021 at or about 7.02pm, at the non-signalized T-junction of West Coast Crescent by West Coast Link, Singapore, the accused drove her motorcar, SJJ6078R, on a road without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, to wit, by failing to give way to traffic with right of way when making a right turn from a minor road into a major road, resulting in a collision with the victim, who was proceeding straight from the accused’s right to left direction along the major road, and hurt was caused to the victim.

7       As a result of the accident, the victim was conveyed to the National University Hospital (“NUH”) by ambulance and was hospitalised from 1 August 2021 to 4 August 2021 before being discharged with 10 days of hospitalization leave from 1 August 2021 to 10 August 2021.

8       The victim was subsequently hospitalised from 10 August 2021 to 15 August 2021 for further treatment of his injuries and was discharged with 48 days of hospitalization leave from 10 August 2021 to 26 September 2021.

9       According to the medical report dated 21 October 2021 prepared by Dr Christian Andador Cortez, Resident Physician from Emergency Medicine Department, the victim sustained swelling and deformity over his left ankle with tenderness at malleolar region and base of metatarsal. X-ray of left ankle revealed comminuted fractures of his left tibia-fibula which was consistent for diagnosis of left Pilon Fracture. The victim was admitted for operation and backslab was applied for immobilization.

10     The footage from the accused’s in-vehicle camera revealed that she had made the right turn at the non-signalized T-junction of West Coast Crescent junction West Coast Link when the victim was travelling straight from the accused’s right side along the major road of West Coast Link. This resulted in the front portion of victim’s motorcycle colliding onto the right front portion of the accused’s motor car. The right front portion of the accused’s motorcar was scratched and dented while the front portion of the victim’s motorcycle was found to be scratched and cracked.

11     At the time of accident, traffic volume was moderate, weather was fine and the road surface was dry with good visibility.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

12     The prescribed penalty for an offence of driving without reasonable consideration for other road users and causing hurt under s 65(1)(_b_) punishable under s 65(4)(_a_) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”) is fine not exceeding $2,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

13     In addition, s 42(1) of the RTA provides that a court before which person convicted of an offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle, may in addition to the punishment provided for the offence, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for any period as the court may think fit.

## Antecedents

14     On 8 July 2018, the accused paid composition of $150 for an offence of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

15     The Prosecution had submitted that the accused’s the culpability was low while the harm should be pegged at the serious category as the charge had been reduced to one under s 65(4)(a) of the RTA. It was highlighted that the duration of the victim’s medical leave was long as he was given a total of 48 days. In addition, surgery was performed on the victim. The Prosecution sought a fine of $2,500 and a disqualification for a period of 15 months for all classes of vehicles.

## Plea in mitigation

16     The accused had urged the Court to reduce her sentence as she is a student at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (“SUSS”). According to her it would be hard for her to pay the fine as she is the eldest daughter and is paying for the household expenses.

17     The accused is presently working as an ad hoc security officer. She pays $1,100 for the house and about $4,000 had to be set aside for her upcoming university modules.

## Decision on sentence

18     S 65(1) of the RTA encapsulates the primary offence of driving without due care or reasonable consideration for other persons using the road. The subsequent subsections from ss 65(2) to 65(4) are the penalty prescribing provisions, each tiered according to the degree of hurt caused and for s 65(5), for any other case of non-personal injury or potential harm.

19     The present offence under s 65(1)(_b_) of the RTA was enacted on 1 November 2019, following the passing of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2019 (Act 19 of 2019). The Amendment Act arose out of a review of the RTA and it aimed to provide stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving.

20     In the present case, both personal injury as well as property damage were occasioned by the accused’s irresponsible driving. In determining the appropriate sentence, I had considered the following mitigating factors _ie_ the remorse shown by her early guilty plea at the first court mention and that this was her first court conviction.

21     Although the accused had submitted that she is the eldest daughter and is paying for the household expenses, I did not place much weight on this factor. It is trite that the impact on livelihood and hardship to the family caused by the imposition of a sentence should be given little weight unless there are exceptional circumstances (_CCG v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGCA 19</span> at \[6\]; _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span> at \[11\]). In the present case, I did not find that there were exceptional circumstances.

22     After a careful consideration of the offence-specific as well as offender-specific factors, as I found her culpability to be low and the harm being at the higher end of moderate, I was of the view a fine of $2,000 in default 7 days’ imprisonment was just and appropriate. I did not think that the maximum fine of $2,500 sought by the Prosecution was necessary in view of factual matrix of the present case.

23     I now provide the reasons for the disqualification order.

### Disqualification Order

24     In deciding on the appropriate period of disqualification, I was mindful that the disqualification order and the fine imposed are not mutually compensatory; an increase in the quantum of the fine imposed should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced period of disqualification than would otherwise have been ordered: _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> at \[13\]. The fact that the fine imposed in this case was at the higher end of the prescribed fine provided for under s 65(4)(a) RTA was therefore not a reason for me to reduce the period of disqualification.

25     In determining the appropriate length of the disqualification order, I was guided by the approach in the recent case of _Kwan Weiguang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 121</span> (“_Kwan_”). Although the High Court dealt with an appeal against a disqualification order of 15 months that was imposed on the appellant for an offence of dangerous driving under s 64(1) and punishable under s 64(2C)(_a_) of the RTA, the factors considered were relevant to the present case.

26     It was held by the High Court at \[59\] that the objective of the disqualification order is as follow:

> A driving disqualification order combines three sentencing objectives: punishment, protection of the public and deterrence (_Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (“_Edwin Nathen_”) at \[13\]). Often, due to the limited range of fines in the punishment provision, the impact of a disqualification order is likely to be felt much more acutely than any marginal increase in the quantum of the fine (see Edwin Nathen at \[13\]).

27     The High Court also held at \[61\]:

> 61 A disqualification order also serves to remove the privilege to drive from those who have abused it, and this also reinforces the notion of shared usage of the roads. It must be remembered that driving is an inherently dangerous activity. The licence to drive is a privilege accorded to persons who, through a series of properly administered tests, have demonstrated that they are capable of meeting the standards expected of a reasonably competent driver (_Jali bin Mohd Yunos v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1059</span> at \[36\]). The former Minister for Home Affairs, Prof S Jayakumar, had expressed the following view which reinforces this notion (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (28 March 1990) vol 55 at col 960): “… we must get every driver in Singapore to note that when he is issued a licence, it is in fact a very special privilege and it is granted on condition that he drives in a responsible manner bearing in mind the interest of others.”

28     In _Kwan_ at \[65\] to \[71\], the High Court held that the relevant and material factors when determining the period of disqualification are:

> (a)     Circumstances of the commission of the offence;

> (b)     Continued ability to drive and attitude towards other road users.

#### Circumstances of the commission of the offence

29     In the present case, the collision had occurred when the accused, while making a right turn from West Coast Crescent, a non-signalised T-junction into West Coast Link, a major road had failed to give way to the victim who was proceeding straight from the accused’s right to left direction. It was evident that the accused had failed to make the necessary checks on the traffic along both sides of West Coast Link and ensured that she could proceed safely onto the major road before making the right turn. As the victim was travelling along West Coast Link, a major road it was clear that he had the right of way as opposed to the accused who was from a minor road.

30     Although the accused’s in-vehicle footage showed that the accused had initially stopped to wait for the oncoming vehicles on her right along West Coast Link to clear, she failed to ensure that there was a sufficient gap between her vehicle and the traffic along West Coast Link before suddenly accelerating forward to make the right turn onto the opposite side of West Coast Link. This resulted in the front portion of victim’s motorcycle colliding onto the right front portion of the accused’s motor car. The victim suffered comminuted fractures of his left tibia-fibula while his while the front portion of his motorcycle was found to be scratched and cracked.

#### Potential harm to road users

31     I next considered the potential harm to other road users. Potential harm refers to the harm that could have been caused but was not. The assessment of potential harm necessarily involves an assessment of the _likelihood_ of the harm occurring. This assessment must be made against the relevant factual matrix and not in a vacuum: _Neo Chuan Sheng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 97</span> at \[21\] (“_Neo Chuan Seng_”).

32     The level of potential harm would be assessed against facts which would include (among other things) the condition of the road, the volume of traffic or number of pedestrians actually on or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road at the relevant time, the speed and manner of driving, visibility at the relevant time, the type of vehicle, and any particular vulnerabilities (_eg_, a truck or car colliding into a motorcycle or pedestrian). There would not be any potential harm to other vehicles or pedestrians if there were no other vehicles or pedestrians that were on or that might reasonably have been expected to be on the road at the relevant time. The volume of traffic and number of pedestrians might also be so minimal that the potential harm can only be assessed to be low, even if serious damage or injury could be caused if that unlikely possibility were realised: _Neo Chuan Seng_ at \[22\].

33     At the time of accident on 1 August 2021 at or about 7.02pm, the traffic volume along West Coast Link was moderate, the weather was fine and the road surface was dry with good visibility. The volume of traffic traversing West Coast Link in both directions was also evident from the accused’s own in-vehicle footage. In the circumstances, I was of the view that the potential harm to other road users travelling in both directions of West Coast Link that could have resulted from the accused’s act of irresponsible driving was on the higher end of moderate.

34     In the present case, I was mindful that unlike _Kwan_’s case there was no violence or threats of violence by the accused which are characteristic of road rage situations might require a longer period of disqualification. Nevertheless, the present case was not an instance where the accused was an offender with a clean driving record and no injury or damage was caused such that a disqualification period of less than 12 months could be considered. As her culpability was low but the harm was at the higher end of moderate and the accused has a previous composition for speeding on 8 July 2018, an uplift of a period of disqualification for all classes of vehicle of more than 12 months was necessary.

35     It was clear that in the present case, it was within the public’s interest to remove such a driver from the roads for a substantial period of time. In my view, taking all the above circumstances into account, a disqualification period of fifteen months for all classes of vehicles was appropriate to fulfil the objectives of punishment, the protection of the public and deterrence.

36     All things considered, I was of the view that the fine of $2,000 in default 7 days’ imprisonment and a disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 15 months was just and appropriate in the circumstances.
