Civil Procedure – Costs – Security – Legally-Aided Litigant

Statutory Interpretation – Protection from Harassment Act – Abolishment of Tort of Harassment

Tort – Rule in Wilkinson v Downton

24 December 2019

### Patrick Tay Wei Sheng DR:

1       The plaintiff (“Nina”) is a foreign domestic worker from Indonesia. The first defendant (the “Agent”) is the intermediary through whom she found work in Singapore. The second defendant was the employer (the “Employer”) with whom she worked in Singapore.

2       On 7 March 2016, Nina started work with the Employer. On or around 21 March 2016, she “left the \[Employer’s\] house and returned to the \[Agent\], asking for a transfer of employment”.[^1] On 23 March 2016, she jumped from a 3rd\-level apartment that belonged to the Agent, and suffered physical injuries from the ensuing fall.

3       Nina now brings action against the Agent and the Employer. She claims against the Agent for misrepresenting that she (_ie_, the Agent) had been a licensed intermediary who would procure a safe workplace for her in Singapore, as well as for wrongfully detaining her in the apartment.[^2] She also claims against the Employer for inflicting upon her psychiatric harm,[^3] and for conspiring with the Agent to detain her in the apartment wrongfully.[^4]

4       The Agent applied for security for her costs of the action. The Employer applied to strike out the action on the ground that it was frivolous, vexatious, or an abuse of the process of the court. After hearing the parties, I declined to order Nina to provide security for the costs of the Agent, but struck out her action as against the Employer. I now provide the reasons for my decisions.

### Action against Agent

5       Nina admits that she is ordinarily resident outside of Singapore. I thus possess the jurisdiction to order her to provide security for the costs of the Agent under O 23 r 1(1)(a) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2009 Rev Ed). But it remains for me to decide whether, in the circumstances of the case, it is just to so order. Because of the undisputed impecuniosity of Nina, a factor that assumes near-critical importance is whether an order of security would stifle a genuine claim in respect of at least part of the action (_Sembawang Engineering Pte Ltd v Priser Asia Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 2 SLR(R) 358</span> at \[25\]).

#### Misrepresentation

6       The Agent concedes that she did not at the material time possess a licence to operate as an intermediary for foreign domestic workers in Singapore. But she maintains that Nina did not suffer any loss thereby because Nina ultimately received approval from the relevant authorities to, and did in fact commence, work in Singapore as a foreign domestic worker.

7       I do not think that the misrepresentation claim cannot be brought _bona fide_ simply because the Agent had helped Nina to obtain the necessary approvals to work in Singapore as a foreign domestic worker. This claim is not based purely on a representation that the Agent had the ability to help a foreign domestic worker to obtain approval to work in Singapore. It is based also on a further representation that the Agent had the ability to procure a _safe workplace_ for the foreign domestic worker. Insofar as this latter representation was untrue and Nina suffered loss in reliance on it, the misrepresentation claim can be brought _bona fide_.

#### Wrongful imprisonment

8       The Agent admits that she had locked the apartment while Nina had been in it. But she submits that there can be no wrongful imprisonment claim because she had done so for a lawful purpose: preventing strangers from entering the apartment.

9       The tort of false or wrongful imprisonment protects persons from loss of liberty without lawful authority or justification. It is established when the defendant performs an act that directly and intentionally causes the plaintiff to be confined within a particular area delimited by the defendant (_Goel Adesh Kumar v Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd (SATS Security Services Pte Ltd, third party)_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 289</span> at \[16\]).

10     The Agent prevaricates as to her intentions in locking the apartment while Nina had been in it. In her first affidavit in her summons, she simply asserts that the “allegations of wrongful imprisonment are unsubstantiated by cogent facts” and does not deny an unlawful intention to detain Nina in the apartment. Only in her subsequent affidavit in her summons, which she filed after a round of oral arguments on the wrongful imprisonment claim, does she explain she had locked the apartment for the safety of its occupants. Even so, there is no evidence that Nina could have unlocked the apartment on her own to let herself out of it. It is thus unclear whether the degree of restraint applied by the Agent in locking the apartment was necessary to achieve her professed purpose of protecting its occupants. I do not thereby think that the wrongful imprisonment claim is one that cannot be maintained _bona fide_.

#### Agent as a legally-aided litigant

11     For completeness, the Agent is a recipient of a grant of legal aid for this action. Nina submits that because the Agent would thereby not incur any legal costs in defending this action, the Agent should not be entitled to any security for those costs.

12     I do not accept this submission. A legally-aided defendant in an action is entitled to its costs if it succeeds therein (except against another legally-aided litigant). This is even as it enjoys immunity from adverse costs orders in the event that it does not so succeed. Under s 16(1) of the Legal Aid and Advice Act (Cap 160, 2014 Rev Ed) (the “LAA”), the court is not simply empowered, but is in fact required, to so order.

> **Costs**

> **16**.—(1)    In proceedings to which an aided person is a party, the court shall make, in favour of the aided person, the like order for costs (except against another aided person) as the court would have made in favour of the aided person had he not been an aided person, and _in proceedings in which costs follow the event an aided person shall_ (except against another aided person) _be entitled to costs in the like manner as if he were not an aided person_, notwithstanding that no amount is or will be payable by the aided person, or that the costs are in excess of the amount which is or will be payable by the aided person. \[emphasis added\]

13     An order of security for costs enables a defendant to recover costs from a foreign-domiciled plaintiff from a fund within Singapore if the action against it is unsuccessful. The rationale for this procedure is that while a plaintiff can decide on whether to run the risk of bringing an action against a party who may not be good for costs, a defendant has no comparable choice. In consequence, the law regards him more favourably, albeit only slightly (_Singapore Civil Procedure 2019: Vol 1_ (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2019) at para 23/0/2). And this rationale is not diminished just because the defendant is legally aided, and whether or not the defendant enjoys immunity from adverse costs orders if judgment is eventually entered against it.

14     Moreover, there is a substantial public interest in granting security for costs to a legally-aided defendant. Pursuant to s 16(2) of the LAA, a legally-aided person in whose favour an order of costs is made must then pay to the Director of Legal Aid any monies that it recovers in respect of those costs.

> **Costs**

> **16**.—…

> (2)    Where any moneys are recovered by an aided person (whether in proceedings or by virtue of a settlement or compromise), he shall be liable to pay to the Director so much of the moneys so recovered as is recovered in respect of costs.

Read together with s 16(1) of the LAA, granting a legally-aided defendant security for its costs helps to preserve the resources of the Director of Legal Aid. These resources can then be applied towards assisting other persons of limited means, thereby facilitating access to justice.

#### Conclusion

15     For these reasons, I dismissed the application by the Agent to have Nina provide security for her costs.

16     Because the Agent is a legally-aided litigant in this action, she is not liable for costs to any other party in the action (s 12(4)(c) of the LAA). I therefore did not make an order of costs against her.

### Action against Employer

17     To recapitulate, Nina brings two claims against the Employer.

> (a)     a claim in a “tort of outrage”, which claim she clarified during oral arguments to be one that was in substance a claim under the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ <span class="citation">\[1897\] 2 QB 57</span>; and

> (b)     a claim for conspiracy, in that the Employer had conspired with the Agent to wrongfully detain her in the apartment.

#### Outrage / Wilkinson v Downton

18     In her statement of claim, Nina pleads is a “tort of outrage” as against the Employer, the main factual basis of which is “constant scolding and \[verbal\] abuse”[^5] from 7 March 2016 to 21 March 2016. Nina adds that the Employer had thereby displayed a “reckless disregard for the likelihood of causing emotional distress” and that such conduct was “extreme and outrageous”.[^6]

> Pending further discovery and/or interrogatories, details of the abuse are primarily that the \[Employer\] had acted intentionally or recklessly in:

>> (a)    scolding \[Nina\] every single day during her employment by calling her “dog”, “stupid” among other insults, and asking her to face the wall for extended period sometimes from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

>> (b)    disparaging \[Nina\] with scathing statements such as “If you don’t want for work for me, you can work as a prostitute” and/or “you are ﬁt to be a sex worker” ;

>> (c)    berating \[Nina\] when the \[Employer\] did not like her cooking;

>> (d)    screaming and yelling at \[Nina\] even when she tried to ask the \[Employer\] for feedback on her faults;

>> (e)    depriving \[Nina\] of her rest day in the ﬁrst month of employment;

>> (f)    delaying \[Nina’s\] meals past appropriate meal times; and

>> (g)    making \[Nina\] assume excessive workload taking care of 3 children and an elderly mother for extended hours, from 4.30 a.m. till 10 p.m. or later depending on when the children go to sleep.

19     During oral arguments, Nina clarified that this claim was in substance one under the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_, which was propounded by the English High Court in respect of the intentional infliction of harm.

20     There are four elements in a _Wilkinson v Downton_ claim, as observed by the Court of Appeal in _Ngiam Kong Seng and another v Lim Chiew Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 674</span> and the High Court in _Malcomson Nicholas Hugh Bertram and another v Mehta Naresh Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 379</span>:

> (a)     that the defendant committed an act with an intention to cause physical harm;

> (b)     that the act was likely to cause physical harm (including psychiatric harm) to the plaintiff;

> (c)     that such physical harm was in fact caused to the plaintiff; and

> (d)     that the harm was not too remote in that the consequences of the act were within the reasonable contemplation of the defendant.

21     The Employer takes the position that the _Wilkinson v Downton_ claim is unsustainable, both in fact and at law. She submits that factually, the assertions by Nina of emotional abuse (at \[18\] above) are contradicted by the contemporaneous evidence of the relevant events. She adds that legally, too, the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ has no room to operate in Singapore in light of s 14 of the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 (Act 17 of 2014) (the “POHA”), which abolishes the common law tort of harassment in Singapore.

##### Factual sustainability

22     The primary evidence adduced by Nina in support of her _Wilkinson v Downton_ claim is an article written by a journalist (Kristen Han, “Domestic Worker Jumps out of Window to Escape Agent Abuse”, _The Online Citizen_ (5 October 2017)) and a letter drafted by the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (“HOME”).[^7] After her fall from the apartment, Nina had been taken in by HOME and housed at its shelter. There, as Nina deposes, she had “spoken with Kirsten Han, a journalist with whom HOME had put me in touch … to document my abuse and wrongful imprisonment”.[^8]

23     I find that the _Wilkinson v Downton_ claim is factually unsustainable. The documentary evidence adduced by Nina does not support and in fact undermines her assertions that the Employer had intentionally inflicted harm upon her. The article, which was written to document Nina’s “abuse and wrongful imprisonment”[^9] describes only abuse that had been perpetrated by the Agent, and is silent on whether the Employer had done the same. It also suggests that Nina had asked for a transfer from the Employer was not because of any abuse but because Nina had been “deeply homesick”. This undercuts the allegations by Nina that the Employer had intended to cause or had in fact caused her harm.

24     This is the relevant part of the article:[^10]

> Upon her arrival in Singapore, Nina quickly regretted her decision. _She was overwhelmed by the culture shock of transitioning from her sleepy village to the modern urban metropolis, and deeply homesick_. But she had a loan to pay off, so going home felt out of the question, no matter how much she wanted it. **_Still_**_, she asked her agent for a transfer after just two weeks with her employer_.

> Her agent—who Nina had only known as Nora—wasn't happy. Nina said that she was taken from her employer’s home to the agent's office, and made to stand for hours facing the wall as punishment. She then stayed in the agent\[’\]s home while a new employer was sought.

> Speaking to us in 2016, Nina said that she was made to do household chores in the agent's home. She also said that she was subjected to verbal abuse. She told case workers at HOME that she was likened to a dog, or told that she was fit to be a sex worker. All this simply contributed to her sense of isolation and distress.

> “My mind was confused. I was so far away from home," Nina said.

> \[Emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

25     I note that the letter states that Nina, when she arrived at HOME, had been “shaken up from the end of her employment and her subsequent escape from her former agent’s apartment by jumping” and “also traumatised from all the scolding and insults during her employment.”[^11] But the letter was written only belatedly, on 16 April 2019, after this action had commenced and almost three years after the relevant events. Further, it is a mere unsworn statement made purely to support this action by Nina, and without actual knowledge of any events that took place between Nina and the Employer. I am unable to place any weight on it.

26     Accordingly, I find that the _Wilkinson v Downton_ claim by Nina against the Employer is factually unsustainable.

##### Legal sustainability

27     My finding that the _Wilkinson v Downton_ claim against the Employer is factually unsustainable is sufficient reason to strike it out. Still, the parties had canvassed the effect of s 14 of the POHA, which abolishes the common law tort of harassment in Singapore, on the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_. I will therefore examine it briefly.

28     Pursuant to s 14 of the POHA, the common law tort of harassment is abolished and “no civil proceedings shall be brought for the tort of harassment except under the Act”.

> **No civil action for common law tort of harassment**

> **14**.—(1)    The common law tort of harassment is, for the avoidance of doubt, hereby declared to be abolished and no civil proceedings shall be brought for the tort of harassment except under this Act.

> (2)    Nothing in subsection (1) shall prevent the commencement of proceedings for any act or conduct which occurred before 15 November 2014.

29     The enactment of s 14 of the POHA was necessitated by the uncertainties arising from two decisions of the High Court: _Malcomson_ and _AXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd v Chandran s/o Natesan_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 545</span>. In _Malcomson_, Lee Seiu Kin JC recognised a common law tort of harassment in respect of determined conduct that is directed at persons and that is calculated to produce discomfort, unease, and/or distress (at \[55\]–\[57\]). In _AXA Insurance_, however, Choo Han Teck J expressed concern that the absence of any requirement in _Malcomson_ for “direct contact” between the parties or for proof of damage rendered the scope of the tort too uncertain, and suggested that the issue be left to Parliament (at \[10\]).

30     Parliament enacted the POHA to clarify this uncertainty. Thereunder, the common law tort of harassment is replaced with a self-contained code for all actions for harassment in Singapore (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (13 March 2014) vol 91 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)):

> \[C\]lause 14 abolishes the common law tort of harassment. _All actions for harassment will be covered under this new legislation_. This clarifies the uncertainty arising from the two High Court decisions, _AXA Insurance_ and _Malcomson_, as to whether there is, indeed, a cause of action in the common law tort of harassment in Singapore. \[emphasis added\]

31     But even as s 14 of the POHA expressly abolishes the common law tort of harassment, the legislative intention behind the enactment of the POHA was not to remove the prevailing legal protections against conduct in the nature of harassment but to strengthen them. The POHA was designed to add to, and not to subtract from, the range of civil remedies and self-help avenues available to a person who has been distressed by the tortious conduct. The Minister of Law at the Second Reading of the Protection from Harassment Bill emphasised that the statutory torts created by the POHA will complement the existing common law torts of “nuisance, assault, battery and so on”. And I struggle to think that Parliament did not consider the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ to be within this list of “existing common law torts” to which the POHA was to add. Hence, s 14 of the POHA operates less to eliminate a cause of action for conduct in the nature of harassment and more to clarify the law on it. I set out the speech of the Minister for Law (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (13 March 2014) vol 91 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)).

> \[O\]ur existing civil remedies and self-help avenues are also limited. The High Court's recent decisions … cast doubt as to whether one can even bring a civil action for harassment in Singapore. Other forms of private action, for example, in nuisance, assault, battery and so on also have obvious limitations.

> Since we discussed the possibility of legislation on harassment, there has been a very significant public interest and support for such legislation. I had asked my officers to list the commentaries and articles which have discussed the issue of harassment and cyberbullying since October last year. They have prepared a non-exhaustive list which I will have circulated. These are not the actual articles, but just the list referencing the articles.

> There is clearly a real need to better protect victims of harassment, and indeed I went through that list of articles which have been appearing in the media. Just in the last four and a half months or so, we have had nearly 200 articles in the media on harassment. This shows the extent of public interest, awareness and the extent to which this is a matter of public concern.

32     There is significant overlap between the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ and the common law tort of harassment. This is unsurprising, because the latter was recognised to address limitations in the former. Specifically, the common law tort of harassment expands the boundaries of the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ to allow recovery in cases where the plaintiff suffers distress short of actual physical injury or psychiatric harm (_AXA Insurance_ at \[10\]). Still, there is at least one situation where the rule _Wilkinson v Downton_ has a broader scope than the common law tort of harassment: _one-off_ conduct.

33     The essence of harassment is “repetitive”, “prolonged”, “persistent”, or “sustained” conduct. Although ambiguity remains as to the frequency and duration of conduct required to constitute harassment (Goh Yihan, “The Case for Legislating Harassment in Singapore” <span class="citation">(2014) 26 SAcLJ 68</span> at para 39), it is unlikely that a brief and/or one-off episode will suffice (_Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 582</span> at \[124\]):

> Harassment describes determined conduct which is directed at persons and is calculated to produce discomfort and/or unease and/or distress: see _Malcomson Nicholas Hugh Bertram v Mehta Naresh Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 379</span>. Persistent or prolonged conduct that is directed at causing distress in those responsible for discharging their duties would amount to harassment for the purposes of the subject provisions. _The essence of harassment is not just repetitive conduct but includes prolonged or persistent or sustained conduct_. A persistent course of conduct for a sustained period of time can constitute harassment. \[emphasis in original\]

34     By contrast, an action under the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ may lie even in respect of a brief or one-off episode of conduct. This was so in _Wilkinson v Downton_ itself, where the defendant told the plaintiff, as a practical joke, that the latter’s husband had been hurt in an accident, and the plaintiff suffered nervous shock in consequence. Similarly, in _Janvier v Sweeney_ <span class="citation">\[1919\] 2 KB 316</span>, the defendants had, in order to give the plaintiff a fright, told her that she was under investigation by the military for corresponding with an enemy spy. The plaintiff suffered severe nervous shock in consequence, and the English Court of Appeal held that the defendants were liable to her in damages on the authority of _Wilkinson v Downton_.

35     On a related note, there is also significant overlap between the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ and the statutory torts in ss 3 and 4 of the POHA. These statutory provisions concern the causing of “harassment, alarm or distress” through conduct that is “threatening, abusive or insulting”.

> (a)     Section 3 of the POHA governs such conduct that is intentional and directed at a particular person.

>> **Intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress**

>> **3**.—(1)    No person shall, with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress to another person, by any means —

>>> (a)    use any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or

>>> (b)    make any threatening, abusive or insulting communication,

>> thereby causing that other person or any other person (each referred to for the purposes of this section as the victim) harassment, alarm or distress.

>> …

>> (3)    In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (2), it is a defence for the accused person to prove that his conduct was reasonable.

> (b)     Section 4 of the POHA governs such conduct that is not directed at a particular person but that is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to any person who perceives the conduct.

>> **Harassment, alarm or distress**

>> **4**.—(1)    No person shall by any means —

>>> (a)    use any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or

>>> (b)    make any threatening, abusive or insulting communication,

>> which is heard, seen or otherwise perceived by any person (referred to for the purposes of this section as the victim) likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.

>> …

>> (3)    In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (2), it is a defence for the accused person to prove —

>>> (a)    that he had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the communication made, by him would be heard, seen or otherwise perceived by the victim; or

>>> (b)    that his conduct was reasonable.

36     In my view, ss 3 and 4 of the POHA encompass much of the conduct that is covered by the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_. Read with s 11 of the POHA, these provisions create a civil remedy for the intentional causing of harm, which is the essence of the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_.

37     In fact, ss 3 and 4 of the POHA are broader than the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ in at least three ways. First, like the common law tort of harassment formulated in _Malcomson_, there is no need for the plaintiff to have suffered actual physical injury or psychiatric harm. Second, there is no need for the defendant to have intended to inflict physical or psychiatric harm, as long as the conduct “was perceived by \[the plaintiff\] likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress” thereby (s 4(1) of the POHA). Third, the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ appears to admit of a defence of reasonable justification (see _James Rhodes v OPO (by his litigation friend BHM)_ \[2015\] UKSC 32), while ss 3(3) and 4(3) of POHA expressly confine any such defence to criminal proceedings even as See Kee Oon J in _Benber Dayao Yu v Jacter Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 316</span> at \[43\]–\[50\] accepted that the defence applied in civil proceedings for a protection order under s 12 of the POHA.

38     On the other hand, while ss 3 and 4 of the POHA require the conduct by the defendant to have been “abusive”, “insulting”, or “threatening”, it is not apparent that a similar requirement applies in a _Wilkinson v Downton_ claim. In _Wilkinson v Downton_ itself, the wilful communication of a falsehood that caused psychiatric harm was _ipso facto_ actionable (_Ngiam Kong Seng_ at \[138\]). Even so, the communication of “half-truths” and “outright lies” have been held to be “abusive” under ss 3 and 4 of the POHA. In _Benber_, the defendant published untrue words to the effect that the plaintiff was a fraud and a sex offender. See J held that those words were both “insulting” and “abusive” (at \[40\] and \[42\]). Although this communication was made _of_ the plaintiff and not _to_ the plaintiff, See J found the words themselves, and not just the conduct of the defendant in publishing them, to be “abusive” and “insulting”. In doing so, See J referred to the Illustration to s 4 of the POHA, which suggests that words spoken of a plaintiff may be “abusive” or “insulting” without more, insofar as the plaintiff has seen, heard, or otherwise perceived those words. This is even if the plaintiff does not know whether other persons have perceived the words.

> X and Y are classmates. X posts a vulgar tirade against Y on a website accessible to all of their classmates. One of Y’s classmates _shows the message on the website to Y, and Y is distressed_. X is guilty of an offence under this section. \[emphasis added\]

39     In any event, given the significant overlap between the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_ and the common law tort of harassment, it may not be unarguable that the former has been abolished to the extent that it overlaps with the latter pursuant to s 14 of the POHA. Otherwise, a plaintiff can always bring what is in substance a claim in the common law tort of harassment by pleading it as one under the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_. Still, given my finding that the _Wilkinson v Downton_ claim by Nina against the Employer is factually unsustainable, there is no need for me to decide on this issue, and I will not do so. I thus confine myself to observing that in place of the common law tort of harassment now stand two statutory torts of causing harassment, alarm, or distress in ss 3 and 4 of the POHA. And Parliament in enacting these torts intended not to reduce the prevailing legal protections against conduct in the nature of harassment but to strengthen them. Ultimately, therefore, it may be better to speak of whether an action is more appropriately brought under the POHA or the rule in _Wilkinson v Downton_, than to speak of whether the cause of action has been abolished pursuant to s 14 of the POHA.

#### Conspiracy to wrongfully detain

40     Nina pleads that the Employer had been “kept informed by the \[Agent\] of \[her\] wrongful detention at the apartment, and would have sanctioned, approved and/or countenanced such detention”.[^12] She pleads further that the Agent and the Employer had “conspired and combined together wrongfully since around March 2016 with the sole or predominant intention of injuring \[her\] and/or of causing loss to \[her\]”.[^13]

41     I find this conspiracy claim untenable. In a conspiracy to injure, the conspirators must share a common design and must take a step to further that design. Further, an intention to injure must be the predominant purpose of their actions (_Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 80</span> at \[23\]; _Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff (administrator of the estates of Shaikah Fitom bte Ghalib bin Omar Al-Bakri and others) and others v Harun bin Syed Hussain Aljunied and others and other suits_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 386</span> at \[57\]).

42     Here, there is no evidence that the Employer had shared a common intention with the Agent to wrongfully detain Nina in the apartment. Nina simply assumes that the Employer had communicated with the Agent after 21 March 2016. Even if that were true, it is not clear that the Employer had known that Nina had been residing with the Agent on and after 21 March 2016. Nor is there anything to indicate that the Employer had known that the Agent had locked the apartment with Nina inside. Nor is there anything to suggest that the Employer had shared a common intention with the Agent to lock the apartment with Nina inside, much less that the Employer had the predominant intention of injuring Nina in doing so.

43     Moreover, there is no suggestion that the Employee had at the material time been unhappy with Nina. The evidence relied upon by Nina, particularly the article based on the interview that she had given while residing at the HOME shelter (see \[22\] above), shows that she had had asked to leave the Employer because she had felt homesick.

44     Nina argues nevertheless that the Employer “conceded to her wrongdoing as a co-conspirator or a joint tortfeasor by paying for \[her\] medical expenses” after the fall from the apartment.[^14] It is difficult to see how this assists Nina. If anything, had the predominant intention of the Employer been to injure Nina, it is improbable that the Employer would have financed the medical treatment of the injuries suffered by Nina.

#### Conclusion

45     For these reasons, I struck out the action by Nina as against the Employer.

46     Because Nina gave evidence that a non-party, Justice Without Borders (“JWB”), had engaged her counsel for her,[^15] the Employer asked that I order JWB to bear the costs of this action between her and Nina. The Employer argued that had Nina been properly advised, Nina would not have proceeded with this action.

47     The court may order costs against a non-party when the circumstances of the case render it just to do so. One such circumstance is a close connection between the non-party and the proceedings: that the non-party funded or controlled the proceedings with the intention of ultimately deriving a benefit from the proceedings. Still, due process must to be accorded to the non-party before an order of costs was made against it (_Goh Eileen née Chia and another v Goh Mei Ling Yvonne and another_ \[2014\] 3 SLR 135 at \[8\]–\[13\]).

48     When asked about how due process could be accorded to JWB and the views of JWB considered, the Employer declined to pursue her submission for an order of costs to be made against JWB. I therefore did not make an order of costs against JWB.

49     Accordingly, I fixed the costs of this action between Nina and Employer at $4,000, inclusive of disbursements, to be paid by Nina to the Employer.
