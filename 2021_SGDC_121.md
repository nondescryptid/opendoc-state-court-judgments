Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9141/2021/01.\]

30 June 2021

### District Judge Toh Yung Cheong:

## Charges

1       This is an appeal by the accused against the sentence imposed. The accused pleaded guilty to four charges relating to his involvement in the delivery of duty unpaid cigarettes. For ease of reference I reproduce the first and third charges below:

>      **First charge: DAC 917459/2020**

>     You, are charged that you, on the 28th day of August 2020, sometime between 4.00pm to 5.00pm, in the vicinity of Block 632B Punggol Drive, Singapore, together with one Ayub Bin Masni, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, were concerned in the delivery of uncustomed goods, to wit, 500 cartons x 200 sticks of Double Happiness brand duty unpaid cigarettes, weighing 88.450 kilogrammes, on which the excise duty of $42,700.00 was not paid, were delivered in a van bearing license plate number GBA7407K, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 128H of the Customs Act (Cap 70) read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), punishable under section 128L(4) of the Customs Act (Cap 70).

>      **Third Charge: DAC 917787/2020**

>     You, are charged that you, on the 28th day of August 2020, at about 5.02pm, in the vicinity of Block 727, Woodlands Circle, Singapore together with one Ayub Bin Masni, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, were concerned in the delivery of uncustomed goods, to wit, 2,268 cartons x 200 sticks of Double Happiness brand duty unpaid cigarettes, weighing 401.209 kilogrammes, on which the excise duty of $193,687.20 was not paid, were delivered in a van bearing license plate number GBA7407K, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 128H of the Customs Act (Cap 70) read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), punishable under section 128L(4) of the Customs Act (Cap 70).

2       In addition, the accused was in respect of all the charges subject to enhanced punishment under section 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act for breach of a basic condition of his Conditional Remission Order. This was reflected in each of the charges:

>     And further, that you, from 8th August 2020 to 19th January 2023, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247 Rev Ed 2014) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order is in effect you, on 28th August 2020, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 875 days from 28th August 2020 to 19th January 2023 for that offence.

3       The second and fourth charges relate to unpaid Goods and Services Tax on the same cigarettes that form the subject matter of the first and third charges respectively.

## Prescribed Punishment

4       The offences are punishable with a fine, imprisonment, or both. For ease of reference the prescribed punishments are summarised below:

## Previous Convictions

5       The accused has a string of previous convictions beginning with a conviction for cheating under s.417 of the Penal Code in 1996. His two most recent convictions before the present case were:

> (a)     In 2012, he was convicted of an offence of LT-1 drug consumption under s.8(b)(ii) and punishable under s.33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

> (b)     In 2015, he was convicted of a number of drug offences including the offence of LT-2 drug consumption under s.8(b)(ii) and punishable under s.33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. He was sentenced to 7 years 4 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

## Facts

6       The accused was engaged by one “Thambi” to deliver duty unpaid cigarettes in Singapore. He was promised payment of S$1,500 after completion of all his deliveries. The accused then recruited Ayub to assist him in the job as a driver and he promised to pay Ayub S$750 for his role.

7       On 27 August 2020, Thambi passed the accused some cash for renting a van for the job and the accused passed the cash to Ayub. Ayub then rented a van bearing the registration number GBA7407K.

8       Acting on Thambi’s instructions, the accused directed Ayub to drive the van to a carpark at West Coast. The van was left there for duty unpaid cigarettes to be loaded into the van. On 28 August 2020, the accused and Ayub returned to the carpark at West Coast and boarded the van. Pursuant to Thambi’s instructions, the accused and Ayub proceeded in the van to Block 635A Punggol Drive to make a delivery and to meet up with an unknown man.

9       When they arrived at the location, the unknown man instructed the accused to deliver 500 cartons of duty unpaid cigarettes to Block 632B Punggol Drive. The accused and Ayub proceeded to Block 632B where they met Wang Xiufeng. Ayub parked their van next to another van bearing registration number GBD5766E. The accused then transferred 500 cartons of duty unpaid cigarettes to GBD5766E.

10     After this delivery, Thambi instructed the accused to proceed to Block 727 Woodlands Circle to deliver the remaining duty unpaid cigarettes.

### DAC 917787 and DAC 917788 of 2020 (401.209kg of cigarettes)

11     On 28 August 2020 at about 5.02pm, Customs officers in the vicinity of Block 727 Woodlands Circle observed the van bearing registration number GBA7407K at the rubbish chute area of the block. Suspecting that there were duty unpaid cigarettes in the van, the officers approached the van. The accused was seated in the front passenger seat while Ayub was the driver. The officers recovered from the van brown boxes containing 2,268 cartons x 200 sticks of Double Happiness brand duty unpaid cigarettes.

12     The accused admitted knowledge of the cigarettes and he was placed under arrest.

### DAC 917459 and DAC 917460 of 2020

13     Later that day, at about 6.10pm, Customs officers in the vicinity of Block 113 Simei Street 1 came across a van GBD5766E. Upon searching the van, the officers found 500 cartons x 200 sticks of Double Happiness brand duty unpaid cigarettes.

14     Later that day, at about 7.20pm, the Customs officers saw Wang Xiufeng approaching the van and they detained him. Wang admitted knowledge of the cigarettes found in GBD5766E and informed the officers that the accused had transferred the cigarettes from another van.

## Mitigation

15     The accused submitted a written mitigation plea highlighting the following:

> (a)     He was a divorcee and father of two.

> (b)     When he agreed to the job, he thought it was a legitimate job. However, he only realised that he was delivering contraband cigarettes on the day of delivery itself.

> (c)     He cooperated with the authorities.

16     In respect of the accused’s claim that he thought it was a legitimate job, the Court confirmed with the accused that he was not qualifying the plea. The accused informed the Court that he found out that he was delivering duty unpaid cigarettes before the delivery took place. This meant that when he made the deliveries, he had the requisite knowledge that he was delivering duty unpaid cigarettes.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence under s.128L(4)

17     The prosecution submitted that the Court should impose a global sentence of at least 29 months’ imprisonment in relation to the underlying offences under section 128L(4) of the Customs Act.

18     In respect of the seriousness of the Customs Act Offences, the prosecution highlighted the following:

> (a)     The accused recruited the co-accused, Ayub Bin Masni to assist him in the delivery of duty unpaid cigarettes.

> (b)     The Court should take into account the total amount of cigarettes involved in both transactions. Therefore, the sentence imposed should be proportionate to the total amount of duty unpaid cigarettes that the accused dealt with, which was **489.659kg**.

19     In support of their submission, the prosecution referred to:

> (a)     The sentencing benchmark by the High Court in _PP v Pang Shuo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 903</span> at \[49\] (“Pang Shuo”). In particular, the prosecution submitted that an application of the benchmark would give rise to the following indicative sentences:

>> (i)       About 8 months’ imprisonment for a quantity of 88.45kg

>> (ii)       About 26 months’ imprisonment for a quantity of 401.209kg

> (b)     A table of unreported decisions decided after _Pang Shuo_ where the quantity of cigarettes was involved was similar. The sentences were largely consistent with the sentencing benchmark in _Pang Shuo._

## Decision on sentence in respect of the punishment under s.128 of the Customs Act

20     In _PP v Pang Shuo_, Justice Chan Seng Onn analysed two scenarios for offences under sections 128H and 128F of the Customs Act and set out sentencing curves for these scenarios:

> (a)      Scenario 1: Standard case

>> (i)       a first-time offender who is not a youthful offender;

>> (ii)       performing a physical role in the cigarette smuggling operation as a paid worker but with no management control or profit share in the syndicate; and

>> (iii)       pleads guilty at the earliest opportunity.

> (b)      Scenario 2

>> (i)       The only difference between the offenders in scenario one and two is that the offender in scenario two would have claimed trial and showed no remorse.

21     I accepted the prosecution’s submission that an application of the quantity involved in the present case to scenario 1 would give rise to an indicative sentence of 8 months’ for a quantity of 88.45kg and 26 months’ imprisonment for a quantity of 401.209kg. I also noted that the prosecution’s table of cases shows that similar sentences were meted out for offences involving similar quantities of duty unpaid cigarettes.

22     After taking note of these indicative sentences, I considered whether there were other sentencing factors that would lead to an increase or decrease in the seriousness of the offence:

> (a)      Accused’s mitigation plea: I accepted that the accused had pleaded guilty early and appeared to be remorseful. This has been taken into account in Scenario 1_._ In respect of his claim that he only found out that the cigarettes were illegal on the day itself, this was not a factor that reduced his culpability since he had every opportunity to refuse to carry out the deliveries. Therefore, there were no other exceptional mitigating factors that would justify a further reduction in the sentence.

> (b)      Accused’s role: It appeared that the accused was a paid worker who was fairly low down in the management hierarchy of the criminal syndicate. He did not have a share in the profits or management control. However, the fact that the accused recruited Ayub to act as a driver and gave him instructions[^1] was a factor that increased the seriousness of the offence. As such I agreed with the prosecution that this should be reflected by an uplift to the sentence.

## Prosecution’s submissions on the enhanced sentence

23     In their submissions on the enhanced sentence, the prosecution referred to the sentencing framework set out _Abdul Mutalib Bin Aziman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 102</span> (“Abdul Mutalib”) and highlighted the following:

> (a)     The fresh offences were of high gravity given the large quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes and that the benchmark sentence set out in _PP v Pang Shuo_ was in the range of 29 months’ imprisonment.

> (b)     The fresh offences were not of a similar nature to his past offences which involved drug consumption.

> (c)     The accused reoffended just 20 days after his release from Prison.

> (d)     The accused recruited the co-accused Ayub Bin Masni to be his accomplice. The prosecution also pointed out that Ayub was also a resident of a halfway house.

24     The prosecution then submitted that given the above factors, the accused’s case fell with Band 3 of the sentencing band due to the high severity of his fresh offences.

## Decision on enhanced sentence

25     The accused is liable to be punished with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 875 days under section 50T(2)(b) for breaching a basic condition of his remission order.

### Sentencing Framework

26     The sentencing framework for enhanced sentences under section 50T was set out by the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[87\]:

> (a)     First, the court should consider the gravity of the fresh offence committed by the offender while on remission, the offender’s rehabilitative prospects and “all other relevant circumstances.” This factor is relevant to the questions of whether an enhanced sentenced should be imposed, and if so, how long that sentence should be.[^2]

> (b)     Next, based on the above factors, the court should determine which sentencing band the case at hand falls under. In addition, the Court may further identify the appropriate degree of severity within a particular sentencing band[^3].

> (c)     Finally, the court should take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances of the case at hand to determine whether the aggregate sentence is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and future prospects.

### Decision to only impose one enhanced sentence

27     While the accused was convicted of four fresh offences, I noted that they took place on the same day and they were all related to the duty unpaid cigarettes that had been loaded into the van GBA7407K. I also noted that the prosecution in their submissions on the overall severity of the fresh offences focused on the total amount of cigarettes involved in all the charges and the global benchmark sentence set out in _Pang Shuo.[^4]_

28     Therefore, I took the view that it would be appropriate to impose only one enhanced sentence. In the next part of this judgment, I will explain how I applied the sentencing framework for the enhanced sentence to the most serious of the four offences. This was the offence involving 401.209kg of duty unpaid cigarettes and $193,687.20 of unpaid Customs excise duty (DAC 917787/2020).

### Application of the Sentencing Framework to DAC 917787/2020

#### Gravity of the fresh offence

29     I am of the view that the gravity of this offence was moderate. In coming to this finding I noted that:

> (a)     The maximum prescribed punishment for a first offender was 3 years’ imprisonment and a fine not exceeding 20 times the duty evaded.

> (b)     The quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes was 401.209kg and this was a large amount.

> (c)     The indicative sentence under the sentencing framework in _Pang Shuo_ was 28 months’ imprisonment. While this was a substantial sentence, I noted that the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[103\] and \[121\] considered a fresh LT-2 consumption offence, with a minimum mandatory sentence of 7 years imprisonment and caning, to be of moderate to high gravity.

#### The offender’s rehabilitative prospects

30     In this section, I consider the accused’s rehabilitative prospects. The High Court in _Abdul Mutalib_ noted at \[57\] that the focus at this stage of the inquiry is on the extent to which the offender’s fresh offending behaviour can be said to have undermined the goals enshrined in s 50E of the Prisons Act. This consideration finds expression in:

> (a)     Section 50T(3)(b): The similarity the fresh offence.

> (b)     Section 50T(3)(c): The timing of the fresh offence

> (c)     Sections 50Y(2)(b) and (c): The offender’s lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration.[^5]

31     However, the High Court cautioned that these statutory factors were not exhaustive and the sentencing court must consider the totality of the circumstances in assessing the offender’s rehabilitative prospects.

32     Turning to the present case, the fresh Customs Act offence was not similar to his previous 2015 drug offences for which he was sentenced to a total of 7 years and 4 months’ imprisonment and caning. As I have earlier indicated, the fresh Customs offence was less serious and of moderate gravity compared to an LT-2 offence. However, the fact that the fresh offence is not similar to the original offence does not necessarily mean that a more lenient approach is warranted. If the fresh offence is dissimilar, the relevant inquiry will turn on the gravity of the fresh offence: _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[59\].

33     Next, I noted that the fresh offence was committed 20 days after he was released from prison. The short interval demonstrates a lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration on his part. This interval between his release and commission of the fresh offence was shorter than any of the four offenders in _Abdul Mutalib._ I was of view that this factor was significant and that it increased the overall severity of the fresh offence.

### Decision on enhanced sentence

34     Therefore, given my findings on the gravity of the fresh offence and the accused’s rehabilitative prospects, I was of the view that the overall severity of the accused’s fresh offence fell within the higher end of Band 2 of the Sentencing Framework. Therefore, I arrived at an indicative enhanced sentence of 568 days’ imprisonment which represented 65% of the remaining remission period of 875 days.

35     In arriving at my decision regarding the appropriate Sentencing Band, I also took note of how the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib_ placed the four cases within the Sentencing Bands. The following table summarises the Sentencing Bands for the offences involving s.50T:

## Totality Principle

36     Having arrived at the Sentencing Band and an indicative enhanced sentence, I proceeded to have a “last look” at the total sentence while bearing in mind the second limb of the totality principle.

37     Given that I had only imposed one enhanced sentence and that it was significantly lower than the sentence imposed for the underlying offence, I was of the view that the aggregate sentence was not a crushing sentence and that there was no reason for any downward adjustment of the sentence at this stage.

## Sentence Imposed

38     Therefore, I proceeded to impose the following sentences:

> (a)     DAC 917459/2020 – 9 months’ imprisonment

> (b)     DAC 917460/2020 – 2 months’ imprisonment

> (c)     DAC 917787/2020 – 27 months’ imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 568 days’ imprisonment

> (d)     DAC 917788/2020 – 5 months’ imprisonment.

39     Next, I ordered the sentences in DAC 917460/2020 and DAC 917787/2020 to run consecutively. Pursuant to section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act, the enhanced sentence will run consecutive to these sentences. The total sentence is therefore 29 months’ and 568 days’ imprisonment. The sentence was also backdated to the date when he was first remanded.

40     At the time of preparing this judgment, the accused is serving his sentence.
