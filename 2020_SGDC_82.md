Mandatory Injunction – Whether erection of a glass door over the private enclosed space of the Defendant’s unit increased the gross floor area of the development – Whether the glass door affected the appearance of any building in the development

2 April 2020 - Judgement reserved.

### District Judge Sheik Umar Bin Mohamed Bagushair:

1       The Plaintiff manages a condominium called Eight Courtyards located at Canberra Drive (the “Development”) and has commenced this OS against the Defendant who is the subsidiary proprietor of a ground floor unit in one of the blocks in the Development (the “Unit”). The Plaintiff sought a mandatory injunction to compel the Defendant to remove a bi-folding glass door (“Glass Door”) that he had erected in the private enclosed space (“PES”) of the Unit.

2       The Plaintiff made three arguments: First, the erection of the Glass Door increased the gross floor area (“GFA”) of the Development, and the requisite approval under Section 37(2) of the Building Management and Strata Management Act (“BMASA”) was not obtained.

3       Second, the erection of the Glass Door affected the appearance of the building the Unit was located in, and no authorisation was sought from the Plaintiff under Section 37(4) of BMASA.

4       Third, the erection of the Glass Door breached Clause 2.20.4 of the Development’s house rules (“House Rules”) which prohibited works that affected the façade of any building in the Development unless the Plaintiff’s approval was sought.

## Whether the erection of the Glass Door increased the GFA of the Development

5       In _MCST Title Plan No. 4066 v Wong Wei Kit Leslie & Jasmin Lau_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 15</span> at \[13\] to \[15\], I had the opportunity to consider the concept of GFA and how the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) used GFA to regulate the bulk and intensity of developments and to meet specific planning objectives, such as encouraging the building of semi-outdoor areas such as balconies and PES through GFA bonus schemes.

6       Through these GFA bonus schemes, URA treated the GFA of semi-outdoor areas, such as balconies and PES, differently from the development’s GFA. URA approves the maximum GFA of a development but if the development’s semi-outdoor areas comply with URA’s guidelines and become eligible for the GFA bonus schemes, then the GFA of those areas do not form part of the development’s GFA. Instead, the GFA of those areas are considered bonus GFA, and the developer is allowed up to a certain amount of bonus GFA over and above the development’s maximum GFA. If the semi-outdoor areas that had been built no longer comply with URA’s guidelines, then they do not become eligible for the GFA bonus schemes and the GFA of those areas is no longer treated as bonus GFA but becomes included in the development’s GFA. In most situations, the maximum GFA of the development would have already been reached, and so any additional GFA would result in the development’s GFA exceeding its maximum GFA. An additional charge would have to be paid to URA for exceeding the development’s maximum GFA.

7       The Plaintiff’s argument is premised on the GFA of the Unit’s PES area being separate from and not included in the Development’s GFA, and that the erection of the Glass Door caused the GFA of the PES area to no longer be treated as bonus GFA but is now included in the Development’s GFA. However, the Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to establish that the GFA of the Unit’s PES area falls under bonus GFA or that it was not included in the Development’s GFA. At the very least, the Plaintiff should have adduced the plans submitted by the developer to URA and URA’s approval of the same. The approved plans would show whether the GFA of the PES area was included in the Development’s GFA or was treated as bonus GFA under one of the GFA bonus schemes. The Plaintiff only adduced a low-resolution copy of the floor plan of the Unit, which itself did not indicate either way whether the Unit’s PES area was included in the Development’s GFA or otherwise. Without the necessary evidence, I cannot assume that the GFA of the PES area was not already included in the Development’s GFA.

8       Therefore, without first adducing evidence to establish that the GFA of the PES area was not included in the Development’s GFA, I am not even able to move on to the next step in the analysis, viz., whether the erection of the Glass Door resulted in an increase in the Development’s GFA. This is because the GFA of the PES area may be included in the Development’s GFA, in which case the erection of the Glass Door in the PES area would not have increased the Development’s GFA.

9       I should mention that the Defendant in his affidavit had referred to the minutes of the Plaintiff’s Council Meeting that suggested that URA had informed the Plaintiff that the erection of the Glass Door did not lead to an increase to the Development’s GFA. The meeting of the minutes held on 25 September 2019 first showed that the Plaintiff had asked its managing agent (“MA”) to “enquire from URA/BCA on the advisory for increased GFA due to the unauthorised structure installation by the \[Unit\].” It appears the MA proceeded to seek input from URA because at the next meeting held on 30 October 2019, the “MA informed Council that the non-compliance of the unauthorized sliding glass doors design does not affect increasing of GFA”. Although this evidence was adduced in the Defendant’s affidavit, the Plaintiff chose not to address it at all in its reply affidavit. At the hearing, when I asked for the Plaintiff’s position on this evidence, Plaintiff’s counsel informed me that what had been communicated by the MA was wrong, and even if it was not wrong, URA’s views would not be binding on the Court.

10     That may be so, but in my view, URA’s views would be persuasive. After all, they are the subject matter experts in relation to GFA. If it had been necessary for me to consider whether the erection of the Glass Door increased the Development’s GFA, evidence of what the MA communicated to URA, and URA’s response, would have been useful.

## Whether the erection of the Glass Door breached the Development’s House Rules

11     The Plaintiff argued that the erection of the Glass Door breached Clause 2.20.4 of the House Rules. Although the Plaintiff in its affidavits suggests that the House Rules are also additional by-laws, no evidence was adduced in support. The House Rules reproduced in the Plaintiff’s affidavits were set out in a document referred to as a “Resident’s Guide”. But there is no evidence that these House Rules had been properly passed as additional by-laws pursuant to Section 32 of the BMASA. The Plaintiff should have adduced evidence that the House Rules had been passed via a special resolution pursuant to Section 32(3) of the BMASA, and had been lodged pursuant to Sections 32(4) and (5) of the BMASA. Since this evidence is absent, I am unable to accept that Clause 2.20.4 of the House Rules formed part of the Development’s additional by-laws that are binding on subsidiary proprietors such as the Defendant.

## Whether the erection of the Glass Door affected the appearance of the building the Unit was in

12     Finally, I address the Plaintiff’s argument that the erection of the Glass Door affected the appearance of the building the Unit was in, and no authorisation was sought from the Plaintiff under Section 37(4) of BMASA.

13     Sections 37(3) and (4) of BMASA provides as follows:

> (3)    Except pursuant to an authority granted under subsection (4) by the management corporation or permitted under section 37A, no subsidiary proprietor of a lot that is comprised in a strata title plan shall effect any other improvement in or upon his lot for his benefit which affects the appearance of any building comprised in the strata title plan.

> (4)    A management corporation may, at the request of a subsidiary proprietor of any lot comprised in its strata title plan and upon such terms as it considers appropriate, authorise the subsidiary proprietor to effect any improvement in or upon his lot referred to in subsection (3) if the management corporation is satisfied that the improvement in or upon the lot —

>> (a)    will not detract from the appearance of any of the buildings comprised in the strata title plan or will be in keeping with the rest of the buildings; and

>> (b)    will not affect the structural integrity of any of the buildings comprised in the strata title plan

14     In _Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 940 v Lim Florence Marjorie_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 773</span> (“_Lim Florence Marjorie_”), the Court said the following in relation to the interpretation of Section 37(3) of BMASA (at \[74\]-\[75\]):

> 74    Determining whether renovations affect the appearance of a building is a factual exercise, undertaken by comparing the façade presented by the flat in question with the façade presented by other similar flats and by all of the flats as a whole: _MCST Plan No 1786 v Huang Hsiang Shui_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 20</span> at \[112\]. Thus, for instance, a feature permanently affixed to a balcony and which does result in the balcony looking different from its original state does affect the overall appearance of the building: _MCST Plan No 1378 v Chen Ee Yueh Rachel_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 630</span> (“_Chen Ee Yueh Rachel_”) at \[17\].

> 75    Whether an improvement effected to a particular flat affects the façade of its building is not to be ascertained as a theoretical exercise but from the viewpoint of a reasonable observer who looks at the building from a position which is practically possible or likely. As Derrington J stated in _Re J Saunders_ (1993) NSW Titles Cases 80-019:

>> The concept of appearance necessarily connotes the existence of an observer who has the capacity to see the appearance. … it is predicated that such views are limited to those which can reasonably be taken. The concept does not extend to a theoretical appearance as it might be seen by a person placed in a position which is not practically possible or likely.

15     Both parties have adduced photos of the Defendant’s PES and the Glass Door, which I reproduce below. I also reproduce the floor plan of the Unit that delineates the PES area (before and after the construction of the Glass Door).

16     I make the following observations. _First_, the Unit originally had a glass door separating the PES area from the indoor area (the “original glass door”). The Defendant then erected the Glass Door that now covers part of the PES area. The Glass Door does not cover a large part of the PES area. _Second_, the distance from the Unit’s Glass Door to the boundary of the Unit’s PES area appears to be the same as the distance from the adjoining unit’s glass door to the boundary of that unit’s PES area. _Third_, the Glass Door erected is of the same design as the original glass door, as well as the other glass doors installed in other units in the Development that separate the PES or balcony area from the indoor area. _Fourth_, according to the Defendant, the Unit is unique, in that no other unit in the Development has the same layout in respect of the PES area. This means it is not possible to compare the façade of the Unit, after the erection of the Glass Door, with that of a similar unit elsewhere in the Development. _Fifth_, the Plaintiff allows subsidiary proprietors in the Development to install full-length blinds at the edge of their balconies or PES areas. The photos adduced by the Plaintiff show that the blinds when fully drawn block the whole balcony or PES from view.

17     Taking into account the principles in _Lim Florence Marjorie_, the photos adduced by parties, and my observations above, I have concluded that the erection of the Glass Door does **_not_** affect the appearance of the building that the Unit is located in. In particular, I took into account the fact that what has been erected is another glass door similar to the one already existing. The external façade therefore remains the same save that the glass door is now closer to the boundary of the PES area, though it does not cover all of the PES area. In fact, a large part of the PES area is left uncovered. The uncovered PES area directly in front of the Glass Door appears to be of the same size as the adjoining unit’s uncovered PES area. A reasonable observer would not be able to tell the difference between the façade of the Unit and the façade of the adjoining unit. Certainly, I had difficulty doing so when parties first appeared before me on 1 November 2019 to take directions on the filing of affidavits. At that time, the Plaintiff had only filed one affidavit. It was not clear from the photos in that affidavit how the Glass Door had affected the appearance of the building the Unit was in, and I pointed out to the Plaintiff’s counsel that I could not tell the difference between the Unit and the adjoining unit whose photos were adduced. The Plaintiff thereby filed a supplementary affidavit with further photos but those photos did not assist the Plaintiff’s case. On the contrary, those photos confirmed that even with the erection of the Glass Door, the façade of the Unit was very similar to the façade of the adjoining unit.

18     The Plaintiff argued that the erection of the Glass Door “mars the aesthetic and appearance of the façade of the building.” For the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs, I disagree. I would also add that the Plaintiff’s argument is hard to square with the fact that several units have erected (presumably with the Plaintiff’s approval) full-length blinds over their balconies and PES areas. These full-length blinds almost fully cover the balconies and PES areas. I consider that these blinds do affect the appearance of the buildings that they are in, to a greater degree than the Glass Door. The erection of the Glass Door at least leaves a significant part of the Unit’s PES area open and viewable, whilst the blinds fully hide the balcony or PES area from view. I think it is somewhat incongruous for the Plaintiff to insist on the original aesthetic or façade of the building when they have been significantly altered by things like the full-length blinds.

19     Whilst it could be said that the installation of the blinds falls within Section 37A of BMASA and that the Plaintiff cannot object to their installation, nevertheless I am of the view that in considering whether the building’s appearance is affected, it is artificial to ignore the fact that many of the units have installed full-length blinds. In other words, an analysis under Section 37(3) of BMASA cannot start from the premise that the building in the Development is in a pure or unaltered state. Account must taken of what it looks like now. That must be the baseline. Many units in the building have installed full-length blinds that have significantly altered or affected the appearance of the building. With that as the baseline, I cannot see how the installation of the Glass Door affected the appearance of the building.

20     I consider that the Strata Titles Board in _Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGSTB 3</span> (“_Low Yung Chyuan_”) approached the issue in a similar manner. In that decision, the Board had to consider whether the sliding windows installed in the subsidiary proprietor’s yard area of her unit breached Sections 37(3) and 37(4) of BMASA. In considering whether there was a breach, the Board took into account (amongst other things) the fact that other subsidiary proprietors had installed (without the MCST’s opposition) screens, blinds, different designs of grilles, netting and Ziptrack in the yard areas of their respective units. Consequently, the Board concluded that the MCST had unreasonably refused the subsidiary proprietor’s application to install the sliding windows. I find the Board’s approach to this issue to be helpful, though I acknowledge that the Board in several instances appears to have elided the difference between Sections 37(3) and 37(4) of BMASA.

21     I therefore find that the erection of the Glass Door has not affected the appearance of the building the Unit was in. Section 37(3) of BMASA is not triggered and no issue of authorisation under Section 37(4) of BMASA arises.

## Conclusion

22     Consequently, I dismissed the OS, with costs to the Defendant. I delivered oral grounds on 6 March 2020. After hearing parties’ costs submissions, and as the Defendant acted in person, I awarded the Defendant costs fixed at $500 (all in).
