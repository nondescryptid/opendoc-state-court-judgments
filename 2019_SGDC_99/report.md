Civil Procedure – Translation of foreign document

6 May 2019

### Deputy Registrar Chua Wei Yuan:

1       This was a ruling on the defendants’ preliminary objection at the first tranche of a part-heard assessment of damages (“AD”).

2       I disallowed the plaintiff from using a document in the Chinese language[^1] on the basis that its accompanying translation[^2] was, contrary to O 92 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), certified by someone who neither was a court interpreter nor filed an affidavit to verify it or to show that he was qualified to translate the document. This was not a case where the defendants waived their objection to compliance with O 92 r 1 (as in _Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH v Hugo Boss AG_ \[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 469 at \[7\] _per_ Belinda Ang Saw Ean J) or where the document was predominantly in the English language such that a translation certificate is unnecessary (_Solomon Alliance Management Pte Ltd v Pang Chee Kuan_ \[2018\] SGHC 139 at \[122\] _per_ Aedit Abdullah J).

3       The plaintiff argued that the defendants should not be allowed to raise such an objection as it had not filed a notice of non-admission to put the plaintiff on notice that he had to call the translator, being the maker of the document, as a witness. He also cited _Tian Shaokai v Tiong Hwa Steel Structure Pte Ltd_ \[2013\] SGHCR 13 (“_Tian Shaokai_”) at \[29\] to support his argument.

4       In my view, this argument missed the point.

5       A notice of non-admission, in the sense as used in O 27 r 5 and as meant by the plaintiff, concerns the _authenticity_ of the document, _ie_, whether any document if described as an original is genuine and if described as a copy is a true copy and, thus, whether such document was written or executed on the date it purports to have been written or executed (O 27 r 4(1)(_a_)–(_b_); _Koh Teck Hee (trading as Mui Teck Heng Garments & Trading Co) v Leow Swee Lim (trading as Meyoung Trading)_ \[1991\] 2 SLR(R) 328 (“_Koh Teck Hee_”) at \[20\] _per_ K S Rajah JC). In contrast, the defendants’ objection concerned the _accuracy_ of the translation or the _admissibility_ of the document. These are separate concerns addressed by O 92 r 1. Not objecting to _authenticity_ does not waive objection to _admissibility_ (O 27 r 4(1); _Koh Teck Hee_ at \[20\]; _Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another_ \[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 417 (“_Jet Holding_”) at \[145\] _per_ Ang J; see also Form 53 of Appendix A of the ROC).

6       Fundamentally, the court is not competent to translate foreign languages (_Shi Wen Yue v Shi Minjiu and another_ \[2016\] 4 SLR 911 at \[7\]–\[8\] _per_ Choo Han Teck J). Thus, a translation by a non-court translator must be accompanied by an affidavit which verifies the translation and, it seems to me, which also states his/her credentials in this regard. In my view, this serves two purposes: it allows the court to be satisfied that the translation is accurate and that the translator is qualified to translate the document, and it allows other parties to cross-examine the translator on these matters if necessary. If O 92 r 1 is not complied with, the document cannot be received, filed or used in court (O 92 r 1; _Jet Holding_ at \[55\]); in other words, the document is inadmissible in evidence (see _EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Snipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and others_ \[2013\] 1 SLR 1254 at \[15\] _per_ Ang J).

7       The plaintiff’s reliance on _Tian Shaokai_ does not help either. There, the court accepted a Certificate of Income issued by the plaintiff’s ex-employer in China even though the defendant challenged it on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to call his ex-employer to corroborate the evidence, because the court took the view that the document had been produced and the defendant had not produced any documentary evidence to contradict it. The defendant’s objection was not whether it complied with O 92 r 1 but whether it sufficed to prove the plaintiff’s income in China. In fact, that document had been translated by a court interpreter in compliance with O 92 r 1.[^3]

8       While the plaintiff submitted that this issue could be deferred to closing submissions, I made my ruling now with a view to best enabling parties to decide how to conduct the remainder of the AD.

9       The plaintiff has appealed my ruling.
