### District Judge Lim Mei Yee Elaine:

## Introduction

1       The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (“CPFTA”) has been a key pillar of Singapore’s consumer protection regime since 2003. Among other things, the CPFTA provides for civil actions by consumers against errant suppliers for losses which they have sustained by reason of unfair practices committed by these suppliers. The CPFTA also empowers the plaintiff to enter into voluntary compliance agreements (“VCAs”) with errant suppliers to stop them from engaging in unfair practices and/or to compensate aggrieved or affected consumers, and to apply to the Courts for declarations, injunctions and accompanying orders against errant suppliers.

2       In these proceedings, the plaintiff seeks declarations that the defendants had engaged in certain unfair practices relating to fungal treatment packages, final injunctions to restrain the defendants from engaging in such practices, and various accompanying orders, under section 9 of the CPFTA.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

3       Although these are not the first enforcement proceedings brought under section 9 of the CPFTA,[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) there are no reported local decisions on the relevant factors to be taken into account by the Court in deciding:

> (a)     whether to exercise its discretion under section 9(1)(b) read with 9(2) of the CPFTA to grant a final injunction restraining a supplier from engaging in an unfair practice, and

> (b)     whether to exercise its discretion to make accompanying orders under section 9(1)(c) read with 9(4) of the CPFTA, and the appropriate duration of such orders,

where the Court has found the supplier to have previously engaged in the unfair practice in question.

4       To provide guidance for future section 9 proceedings, I set out the full grounds of my decision to clarify the applicable legal principles and explain why this was an appropriate case for the grant of final injunctions and accompanying orders.

## The parties

5       The plaintiff is the entity entrusted with administering the CPFTA since 1 April 2018.

6       The defendants are Singapore companies in the business of providing, among other things, manicure and pedicure services and foot-related treatments. The defendant in OSS 285 (“Nail Palace BPP”) provides such services at #04-02 Bukit Panjang Plaza Singapore 677743, while the defendant in OSS 286 (“Nail Palace SM”) provides such services at #02-17 East Point Mall Singapore 528833.

7       It is undisputed that Mr Kaiden Cheng (“Mr Cheng”) is the managing director of the defendants and other related companies providing similar services and products, all of which trade under the business name ‘Nail Palace’ (collectively, the “Group”).[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) It is also undisputed that Ms Catherine Lai Pui Yee (“Ms Lai”) is the sole training manager for all employees in the Group: she is in charge of training and deciding the scope of training, and has the autonomy to develop training curriculum and materials.[^4]

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s case

8       In a nutshell, the plaintiff claims that each of the defendants had committed an unfair practice under section 4(d), read with paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule, of the CPFTA by making misleading representations to a consumer concerning the need for a fungal treatment package. In addition, Nail Palace SM had committed an unfair practice under section 4(a) of the CPFTA by omitting to inform a consumer that certain products were included in the price of a treatment package, thereby resulting in the consumer being misled.

9       The pertinent details of the plaintiff’s claims are set out below. These details are extracted from:

> (a)     in OSS 285, three affidavits filed by Ms Cai Weiting Lynn (“Ms Cai”), and three affidavits filed by Mr Angus Xie (“Mr Xie”), a Senior Assistant Director in the plaintiff’s Consumer Protection Division, on 17 December 2021,[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) 11 March 2022[^6] and 17 May 2022;[^7] and

> (b)     in OSS 286, two affidavits filed by Ms Carine Tan Hwee Hong (“Ms Tan”), on 17 December 2021 and 11 March 2022,[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) and two affidavits filed by Mr Xie on 17 December 2021 and 17 May 2022.[^9]

#### Alleged unfair practice in misrepresenting the need for fungal treatment packages

10     Nail Palace BPP had, through its employee Ms Chen Xiaoye (“Ms Chen”), represented to Ms Cai on 16 August 2020 that: (a) based on her training from Nail Palace, she knew that Ms Cai had fungus on the toenails of her two big toes by looking at them; (b) a six-session fungal treatment package was needed and would be able to treat the fungus (the “Fungus Treatment Package”); and (c) if Ms Cai did not undergo such treatment, the fungal infection would worsen and spread to her other toenails (collectively, the “16 Aug Representations”). Induced by and in reliance of these representations, Ms Cai paid a total of $1,677.76 for, among other things, the Fungus Treatment Package.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

11     In a similar vein, Nail Palace SM had, through its employee Ms Chong Sze Peng (“Ms Chong”), represented to Ms Tan on 22 December 2019 that: (a) based on her training from Nail Palace, she knew that Ms Tan had fungus in one of her big toenails and some of her small toenails by looking at them; (b) the fungal infection could spread easily from one toe to another and eventually to both of Ms Tan’s feet, and could also spread to her husband as they shared the same bed; and (c) a 15-session fungal treatment package, which was subsequently revised to a 12-session fungal treatment package (the “Revised Treatment Package”), was needed and would be able to treat the fungus (collectively, the “22 Dec Representations”). Induced by and in reliance of these representations, Ms Tan purchased the Revised Treatment Package for the price of $11,401.92.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

12     However, these representations were misleading:

> (a)     Ms Cai and Ms Tan did not have fungus on their toenails. They did not experience any symptoms associated with fungal infection, such as itchiness and pain. Moreover, in Ms Cai’s case, she consulted Dr Peter Pang of Royal Care Medical Family Clinic (“Dr Pang”) a few weeks after purchasing the Fungus Treatment Package. Dr Pang had opined that there were no obvious fungus nail or skin changes around her feet and that she had no symptoms of itchiness which were commonly associated with fungal infection.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

> (b)     Further or alternatively, Ms Chen and Ms Chong had no reasonable basis to represent that Ms Cai and Ms Tan respectively had fungus on their toenails:[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

>> (i)       Ms Chen and Ms Chong had failed to comply with the Group’s standard operating procedure, which did not permit staff to rely solely on visual inspection of a customer’s nails to determine whether the customer had a nail fungal infection, but instead required the use of the ‘Fungusless test’ to make such a determination (the “SOP”).

>> (ii)       Mr Cheng and Ms Lai conceded that there are other skin or nail disorders which have similar symptoms to a nail fungal infection, such that their staff may misdiagnose a customer to have nail fungal infection if they rely solely on a visual inspection of nails to reach that conclusion.

>> (iii)       Medical literature shows that nail fungal infections may display similar symptoms as, and be mistaken for, other skin or nail disorders which are not caused by fungus, and that a laboratory microscopic examination and/or fungal culture test using nail scrapings or clippings is required to confirm the presence of fungus.

> (c)     In Ms Cai’s case, she had filed a claim against Nail Palace BPP in SCT/16404/2020 to seek a refund of monies for the unused sessions of the Fungus Treatment Package on account of the fact that Nail Palace BPP had misled her into purchasing the package when she did not in fact have fungus (the “SCT Proceedings”). The tribunal magistrate had granted Ms Cai’s claim on the ground that Nail Palace BPP had no basis to challenge Dr Pang’s diagnosis that Ms Cai had no fungus on her toenails, that Ms Chen was not qualified to diagnose that Ms Cai had fungus on her toenails and in any event, there was no evidence to support Ms Chen’s conclusion that Ms Cai had fungus on her toenails.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

#### Alleged unfair practice in omitting to inform the customer that certain products were included in the treatment package

13     Additionally, Nail Palace SM had committed another unfair practice in that Ms Chong had misled Ms Tan into paying for lipsticks and lip balms by omitting to mention that they were part of the package price for the Revised Treatment Package. Just before Ms Tan left Nail Palace SM’s outlet on 22 December 2019, Ms Chong had told her to take several lipsticks and lip balms as they were free of charge. However, two days later, when Ms Tan collected the invoice for the Revised Treatment Package from the outlet, she realised that she had been charged $258 for a lipstick and a lip balm and another $420 for ten lipsticks/lip balms. Ms Tan did not need the lipsticks and lip balms as they had nothing to do with nail fungal infection.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

#### Reliefs sought

14     The plaintiff seeks the following relief against each of the defendants:

> (a)     A declaration that the defendant has engaged in an unfair practice within the meaning of section 4(d), read with paragraph 1B of the Second Schedule, to the CPFTA, by making a misleading representation concerning the need for fungal treatment(s) or fungal treatment package(s);

> (b)     The defendant be restrained from engaging in the aforesaid unfair practice;

> (c)     Pursuant to sections 9(1)(c) and 9(4) of the CPFTA, accompanying orders that the defendant:

>> a.    Publish, at its own expense, within fourteen (14) days from the date of this Order, details of the declaration and injunction, by way of a full page public notice in the Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao, Berita Harian, and Tamil Murasu.

>> \[which I will term the “Publication Order”\]

>> b.    Must, before any consumer enters into a contract in relation to a consumer transaction with the Defendant during a period of five (5) years from the date of this Order:

>>> (1)    notify the consumer in writing about the declaration and injunction in force against the Defendant; and

>>> (2)    obtain the consumer’s written acknowledgement of receipt of the notice in subparagraph (1).

>>> \[which I will term the “Consumer Notification & Consent Order”\]

>> c.    Must, for a period of five (5) years from the date of this Order, notify the Plaintiff in writing within fourteen (14) days of the occurrence of any of the following events:

>>> (1)    a change in the premises or number of premises at which the Defendant carries on its business as a supplier;

>>> (2)    the conversion of the Defendant from a private company to a limited liability partnership under section 21 of the Limited Liability Partnerships Act;

>>> (3)    the Defendant undergoing any arrangement, reconstruction or amalgamation under Part VII of the Companies Act;

>>> (4)    an order being made under section 71 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 approving a compromise or an arrangement between the Defendant and the Defendant’s creditors;

>>> (5)    the Defendant being subjected to receivership under Part 6 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018;

>>> (6)    the Defendant being subjected to judicial management under Part 7 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018;

>>> (7)    the Defendant being subjected to winding up under Part 8 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018;

>>> (8)    a change in the Defendant’s name or the name under which the Defendant is carrying on business;

>>> (9)    any arrangement by the Defendant to participate in a trade fair;

>>> (10)   if the Defendant adopts for its business a new name, symbol or design, any arrangement by the Defendant to carry out any activity for the purpose of identifying its business with that new name, symbol or design;

>>> (11) a change in the board of directors of the Defendant or a change in the person or persons who hold directly or indirectly 15% or more of the total voting power or total issued shares in the Defendant; or

>>> (12) any shareholder of the Defendant entering into an arrangement under which that shareholder holds on behalf of another person any profits, gains or dividends derived from the carrying on of the Defendant’s business.

>>> \[which I will term the “CCS Notification Order”\]

15     Against Nail Palace SM, the plaintiff also seeks the following reliefs:

> (a)     A declaration that Nail Palace SM has engaged in an unfair practice within the meaning of section 4(a) of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act, by omitting to inform a consumer that certain products were included in the price of a treatment package, thereby resulting in the consumer being misled; and

> (b)     Nail Palace SM be restrained from engaging in the aforesaid unfair practice.

16     The plaintiff submits that granting the proposed injunctions would serve to protect the public interest, mark the Court’s disapproval of the unfair practices, and deter the defendants and other companies in the Group from repeating the unfair practices, regardless of whether they intend to engage again, or continue to engage, in the same.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

17     The plaintiff contends that in any event, the following facts show a risk that the defendants will continue to engage in the unfair practice, thereby reinforcing the need for the proposed injunctions:[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> (a)     The authenticity of the defendants’ trainer’s manual is suspect. In any event, the manual is inconsistent with the Group’s SOP and also wholly inadequate in training their staff.

> (b)     The Group’s refund policy and refund report are false and misleading. Among other things:

>> (i)       At least 9 of the 20 customers in the refund report had filed official complaints with Consumers Association of Singapore (“CASE”) for various unfair practices by the Group. Even after CASE intervened, the Group refused to cooperate and refunded only one of the customers. Moreover, the Group repeatedly refused CASE’s invitations for it to enter into a VCA.

>> (ii)       Apart from the customers listed in the refund report, many other customers had complained to CASE since 3 January 2020 (i.e. the date on which the refund policy was allegedly implemented) about unfair practices by the Group, including those relating to fungal treatments. Even after the plaintiff commenced these proceedings on 17 December 2021, new complaints were still being made to CASE about unfair practices by the Group (including complaints against the defendants).

>> (iii)       The defendants’ standard form invoice expressly stated that all sales and purchases were non-refundable.

>> (iv)       Although Ms Cai was listed in the refund report as one of the “Refunded cases within 5 days”, it was untrue that she was refunded within five days. In fact, Nail Palace BPP refused to refund Ms Cai for her unused fungal treatment sessions on the basis of their non-refundable policy and the non-refundable clause in their invoice, until they were ordered to make a refund in the SCT Proceedings. Even then, they made it difficult for her to collect the refund by insisting that as a condition for the refund, she sign an acknowledgement stating that “I will not hold any actions, claims, compensation against Nail Palace in future”.

>> (v)       Ms Tan encountered similar difficulties in seeking a refund of the Revised Treatment Package. Nail Palace SM had refused to refund her, insisting that their packages and services sold were strictly non-refundable. Moreover, despite CASE’s attempts to request Nail Palace SM to attend a mediation session with her, they ignored these requests.

> (c)     The conduct outlined in the above subparagraphs show that the defendants will not cease their unfair practices unless compelled to do so by a court order. In this regard, the fact that complaints were made against other Nail Palace outlets that are not operated by the defendants is relevant, because all the Nail Palace outlets operate as a group. That they operate as a group is evident from, among other things, the following matters: all the outlets in the Group issue the same standard template invoice, have the same training program, have the same SOP, and have the same alleged refund policy.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

18     The plaintiff further submits that the accompanying orders under section 9(4) of the CPFTA are for the protection of the public, and would enhance the effectiveness of the declarations and injunctions sought. Moreover, the accompanying orders are necessary in light of the genuine risk that the defendants will continue to engage in the aforementioned unfair practices, and to serve a wider need for deterrence.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

### The defendants’ case

19     The defendants filed the following affidavits to resist these proceedings:

> (a)     in OSS 285, Ms Chen’s affidavit and Ms Lai’s affidavit both filed on 28 January 2022, and Mr Cheng’s affidavit filed on 29 March 2022;[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) and

> (b)     in OSS 286, Ms Chong’s affidavit filed on 28 January 2022 and another affidavit by Mr Cheng filed on 29 March 2022.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

#### The defendants did not commit the alleged unfair practices

20     It is undisputed that:

> (a)     under section 4(d), read with paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule, of the CPFTA, it is an unfair practice for a supplier to make a false or misleading representation concerning the need for any goods or services; and

> (b)     under section 4(a) of the CPFTA, it is an unfair practice for a supplier to do or say anything, or omit to do or say anything, if as a result a consumer might reasonably be deceived or misled.

21     However, the defendants deny that they had committed the alleged unfair practices.

22     In OSS 285, Nail Palace BPP denies that it had made misleading representations to Ms Cai concerning her need for the Fungus Treatment Package, on two grounds.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

> (a)     According to Ms Chen, she had merely told Ms Cai that the gap between her toenails and the toe bed may be an indication of fungal infection. Upon hearing that, Ms Cai was anxious and asked what she could do to resolve the fungal infection. Ms Chen informed her that if she indeed had a fungal infection, the Fungus Treatment Package could improve her condition. Ms Cai then requested for the said treatment on her own accord, without asking for any confirmatory tests. In this regard, the ‘Fungusless test’ is not used on every customer, but only when the staff are of the view that there may be a fungal infection or upon the customer’s request for a confirmation.

> (b)     Furthermore, the plaintiff cannot establish with certainty that Ms Cai did not have a fungal infection when she visited Nail Palace BPP’s outlet on 16 August 2020, and that the Fungus Treatment Package was unnecessary. Dr Pang’s memo is inadmissible hearsay evidence. Moreover, Dr Pang’s memo did not conclusively state that Ms Cai did not have a fungal infection, and the views in his memo were based purely on his observations and not any confirmatory tests.

23     In OSS 286, Nail Palace SM admits that Ms Chong had, after observing Ms Tan’s toenails, informed her that she had fungus in some of her toenails and that she needed the Revised Treatment Package to cure her fungal infection.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) However, Nail Palace SM denies that it had made misleading representations to Ms Tan concerning her need for the Revised Treatment Package, or that it had misled Ms Tan into paying for lipsticks and lip balms by omitting to mention that they were part of the package price for the Revised Treatment Package. In Ms Chong’s affidavit, she alleged that:[^24]

> (a)     Ms Tan did not adduce any evidence, such as a medical report, to show that she did not have toenail fungal infection when she visited Nail Palace SM’s outlet on 22 December 2019.

> (b)     It was Ms Tan’s own decision to purchase the Revised Treatment Package without asking for any confirmatory tests. Ms Tan did not seem distressed or reluctant when she agreed to the Revised Treatment Package and had willingly handed over a second credit card to be charged for payment when the first was declined.

> (c)     Ms Chong did not tell Ms Tan that the lipsticks and lip balms were free. She had mentioned on several occasions that these were included in the Revised Treatment Package.

#### The Court should not grant the reliefs sought by the plaintiff

24     It is undisputed that the broad wording of section 9(2) of the CPFTA permits the Court to grant the proposed declarations and injunctions if it is satisfied that the defendants have engaged in the alleged unfair practices, regardless of whether it appears to the Court that they intend to engage again, or to continue to engage, in the said practices.

25     However, the defendants submit that even if the Court finds that they have engaged in the alleged unfair practices, it should not exercise its discretion to grant the proposed injunctions and accompanying orders. This is for the following reasons:

> (a)     As against each defendant, there was only a single complaint of unfair practice from a single complainant. The plaintiff’s submission that there were numerous complaints made to CASE regarding unfair practices committed by the Group (including the defendants) is wholly unsubstantiated, and irrelevant to the extent that the alleged complaints concern Nail Palace outlets which are not operated by the defendants.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

> (b)     The defendants have taken measures to prevent the alleged unfair practices from occurring:

>> (i)       All the defendants’ staff undergo training to deal with issues of fungal infection, and a copy of the trainer’s manual was produced.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

>> (ii)       As of 3 January 2020, the defendants have put in place measures to ensure greater transparency in their services and prices. In this regard, they have implemented a refund policy that allows customers to seek a refund within five days of their purchase, and as of January 2022, have made refunds to 19 customers including Ms Cai.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) The implementation of the refund policy was an entirely voluntary exercise: it cannot be compelled by the plaintiff or the Court.

>> (iii)       Furthermore, Ms Chong has been penalised for her mistake in informing Ms Tan that the lipsticks and lip balms were free of charge when they were not.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

> (c)     The public is already aware of these proceedings given the online media coverage.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

> (d)     Civil remedies have already been sought by the complainants in question, Ms Cai and Ms Tan, from the defendants.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

> (e)     Even if the Court is minded to grant injunctions against the defendants, the Court should refrain from granting the Publication Order and the Consumer Notification & Consent Order. Those orders would have a detrimental effect on the defendants’ business. Moreover, consumers would already be protected by the grant of the injunctions.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) In this regard, if the defendants are operating under an injunction, one must assume that they will comply with the injunction.[^32]

## Issues to be determined

26     Based on the parties’ respective cases, the following are the issues to be determined:

(a)

whether the defendants had engaged in the alleged unfair practices; and

(b)

if the defendants had engaged in such unfair practices, whether the Court should exercise its discretion to grant the injunctions and accompanying orders sought by the plaintiff.

## Issue 1: Whether the defendants had engaged in the alleged unfair practices

### Nail Palace BPP had made a misleading representation concerning the need for fungal treatment packages

27     In my judgment, Nail Palace BPP had engaged in an unfair practice under section 4(d), read with paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule, of the CPFTA, by making a misleading representation to Ms Cai on 16 August 2020 concerning the need for fungal treatment packages.

28     I accept Ms Cai’s evidence that Ms Chen had made the 16 Aug Representations.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) Ms Cai’s evidence is consistent with the contents of her and Ms Chen’s witness statements filed in the SCT Proceedings.

> (a)     In her witness statement dated 7 December 2020, Ms Cai explained that:[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

>> 5.     _Before starting the pedicure, Xiaoye said that I have fungus on my big toes_ and cannot do pedicure.

>> …

>> 7.     _She said I must do fungus treatment otherwise the fungus will spread to my other toes._

>> …

>> 11.     _I believed her because I never had experience with fungus._

>> 12.     _For this reason I agreed to do fungus treatment_ that day instead of pedicure.

>> 13.     _During the fungus treatment and manicure Xiaoye kept telling me that more fungus treatment are needed to get rid of the fungus completely._

>> 14.     _She asked me to get a package_ and said that I can pay by instalments.

>> 15.    The initial package offered amounted at approximately SGD 3,000 for 12 sessions of fungus treatment.

>> 16.    I found it too expensive and I said again that I wanted to see a doctor instead.

>> 17.    Xiaoye kept saying that for fungus no need to see doctor and she reduced the package sessions and the total price.

>> 18.    From 12 sessions to 10, 8 and at the end 6 sessions for fungus treatment.

>> 19.    She said that the sessions would have included free manicure and pedicure.

>> 20.     _She said that fungus would not heal by itself unless I do the treatment._

>> 21\. _At the end I purchased a 6 sessions package for fungus treatment as I was scared by what she said about the fungus on my toes and I had my wedding coming up._

>> …

>> \[emphasis added\]

> (b)     In a similar vein, in Ms Xiao’s witness statement dated 11 December 2020, she stated that she had discovered fungus on Ms Cai’s toenails during her visit on 16 August 2020 and had recommended the Fungal Treatment Package to Ms Cai to treat her fungus problem:[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

>> **16 Aug 2020**

>> 3.     _Ms Cai visited our Bukit Panjang outlet. I discovered Ms Cai has fungus problem on her toenails_ but I did not take a photo of her toenail before the Dermal Fungus Treatment.

>> 4.    After the treatment, I showed her the photo of her toenail after the treatment. She was satisfied with the result.

>> 5.     _Then, I recommended a Dermal Fungus Treatment package to her that is inclusive of sessions of Classic Manicure and Classic Pedicure for free._

>> …

>> 9.    … I also told her there will be no expiry for the package and _she can come more often to treat her fungus problem_.

>> …

>> **29 Aug 2020**

>> 12.    Ms Cai came back to our outlet with her husband. …

>> 14.    Then she said she does not have fungus problem_. I showed her the photo of her fungus infected toenail taken after the treatment_ and asked whether it is her feet. She said the photo is her feet.

>> \[emphasis added\]

29     I am unable to accept Ms Chen’s allegations in these proceedings that she did not affirmatively tell Ms Cai that she had a fungal infection on her toenails but had merely told her that the gap between her toenails and the toe bed may be an indication of fungal infection, and that Ms Cai had requested for the Fungus Treatment Package on her own accord. These allegations are inconsistent with the aforesaid position which she took in the SCT Proceedings. In my view, they are belated afterthoughts raised to resist these proceedings.

30     Turning to the issue of whether that the 16 Aug Representations were false or misleading, I find that they were, because Ms Chen had no grounds to conclude that Ms Cai had fungus on her toenails purely based on a visual inspection. In this regard, it is undisputed that one cannot rely only on a visual inspection of a customer’s nails to determine whether the customer has a nail fungal infection:

> (a)     The Group’s own SOP requires its employees to conduct the ‘Fungusless test’ to confirm whether a customer has a nail fungal infection, before recommending any fungal treatment.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

> (b)     Moreover, it is Mr Xie’s unchallenged evidence that in their respective interviews with the plaintiff, Mr Cheng and Ms Lai had conceded that (i) there are other skin or nail disorders which have similar physical symptoms to nail fungal infection, and (ii) hence, the defendants’ staff cannot rely solely on a visual inspection of a customer’s nails to determine if the customer has a nail fungal infection, as they may otherwise possibly misdiagnose him to have nail fungal infection when he actually does not have such an infection.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

31     Furthermore, I find that Ms Cai had relied on and was induced by the 16 Aug Representations to purchase the Fungus Treatment Package. It is undisputed that at the time of her visit to Nail Palace BPP on 16 August 2020, Ms Cai already had an existing credit package for nail services (including basic manicure and pedicure) with the Nail Palace group. In the premises, there was no necessity for Ms Cai to purchase any further nail services, such as the manicure and pedicure services that were included as part of the Fungus Treatment Package. I accept her evidence that she had purchased the Fungus Treatment Package only because the defendant had misled her into thinking that there was a need for it due to fungal infection on her toenails.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

### Nail Palace SM had made a misleading representation concerning the need for fungal treatment packages

32     In my judgment, Nail Palace SM had engaged in an unfair practice under section 4(d), read with paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule, of the CPFTA, by making a misleading representation to Ms Tan on 22 December 2019 concerning the need for fungal treatments packages.

33     On Ms Chong’s own admission, she had, after observing Ms Tan’s toenails, informed her that she had fungus in some of her toenails and that she needed the Revised Treatment Package to cure her fungal infection.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) In the premises, Ms Chong had clearly made the 22 Dec Representations.

34     I find that the 22 Dec Representations were false and misleading as Ms Chong was in no position to conclude, purely based on visual inspection, that Ms Tan had fungus on her toenails, for the same reasons mentioned at \[30\] above.

35     I accept Ms Tan’s evidence that she was induced by the 22 Dec Representations to purchase the Revised Treatment Package.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40) There was simply no reason for Ms Tan to purchase the said package if she had not been misled into believing that she had nail fungal infection.

### Nail Palace SM had omitted to inform Ms Tan that certain products were included in the price of the Revised Treatment Package

36     Furthermore, I find that Nail Palace SM had also engaged in an unfair practice under section 4(a) of the CPFTA by omitting to inform Ms Tan that the lipsticks and lip balms were included in the price of the Revised Treatment Package. I reach this finding for three reasons.

37     First, in Mr Cheng’s affidavit, he conceded that Ms Chong had informed a customer that the lipsticks and lip balms were free of charge but subsequently proceeded to charge the customer for these items.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) Moreover, it is Mr Xie’s unchallenged evidence that in Mr Cheng’s interview with the plaintiff, he admitted that Ms Chong had misled Ms Tan by omitting to mention that the lipsticks and lip balms were part of the Revised Treatment Package and that as a result, Ms Tan was misled into paying for such products which she did not want or need.[^42] These concessions undermine Ms Chong’s claim that she had mentioned on several occasions to Ms Tan that the lipsticks and lip balms were included in the said package.

38     Second, it is undisputed that Ms Tan had visited Nail Palace SM’s outlet on 22 December 2019 for the sole purpose of getting a manicure and pedicure and treatment for cracked heels and corns.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) In the circumstances, there was no reason for Ms Tan to purchase a total of 12 lipsticks and lip balms, which were completely unrelated to the treatments she was seeking that day, much less for a hefty sum of $678.

39     Third, it is common ground that Ms Chong had cancelled the last two lines of invoice no. 0075678 (with regard to the charges to Ms Tan for the lipsticks and lip balms) and added the Chinese words “_口红不要换去Ag spray_” (meaning “_do not want lipsticks, change to Ag spray_”).[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) This corroborates Ms Tan’s evidence that:[^45]

> (a)     Ms Chong did not tell Ms Tan, prior to her purchase of the Revised Treatment Package, that the lipsticks and lip balms were included in the price of the package. On the contrary, just before she left Nail Palace SM’s outlet on 22 December 2019, Ms Chong had told her to take several lipsticks and lip balms as they were free of charge. Out of courtesy and to end the conversation, Ms Tan took one lipstick and one lip balm on the basis that these were free products;

> (b)     It was only on 24 December 2019 that Ms Tan discovered that lipsticks and lip balms were included in the price of the package, as she had collected the invoices for the package only on that day. She then expressed her surprise to Ms Chong that lipsticks and lip balms were part of the package price, and declined to take the additional ten lipsticks and/or lip balms which Ms Chong tried to pass to her.

> (c)     Ms Chong then told Ms Tan that she would replace the lipsticks and/or lip balms with 1 Ag Tech spray and proceeded to cancel the last two lines of invoice no. 0075678 and add the words “Ag Tech x 1”.

## Issue 2: Whether the Court should exercise its discretion to grant the reliefs sought by the plaintiff

40     Having found that the defendants had engaged in the alleged unfair practices, I grant the declarations sought by the plaintiff.

41     I now consider whether I should exercise my discretion to grant the injunctions and accompanying orders sought by the plaintiff.

### The Court’s discretion to grant injunctions under sections 9(1)(b) and 9(2) of the CPFTA

42     It is apposite to begin my analysis by examining the genesis of and rationale behind the relevant sections of the CPFTA which provide for injunctive relief.

#### The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003 (No. 27 of 2003)

43     Under section 9(1)(b) of the CPFTA, where the Court finds that a supplier has engaged, is engaging or is likely to engage, in an unfair practice, it may injunct the supplier from engaging in the unfair practice:

> 9.—(1)    Where a supplier has engaged, is engaging or is likely to engage in an unfair practice, the District Court or General Division of the High Court may, on the application of the Commission —

>> …

>> (b)    grant an injunction restraining the supplier from engaging in the unfair practice;

44     Section 9(2) of the CPFTA clarifies that the Court’s power to grant a declaration or injunction under section 9(1) may be exercised:

> (a)    if the Court is satisfied that the supplier has engaged in the unfair practice, _whether or not it appears to the Court that the supplier intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in the unfair practice_; or

> (b)    if the Court is satisfied that, _in the event that a declaration or an injunction is not granted, it is likely that the supplier will engage in the unfair practice, whether or not the supplier has previously engaged in the unfair practice and whether or not there is any likelihood of irreparable harm_ to any consumer or class of consumers _if the supplier engages in the unfair practice._

> \[emphasis added\]

45     These provisions of the CPFTA can be traced back to sections 9(1)(b) and 9(2) of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003 (No. 27 of 2003) (the “2003 Act”), which provide that:

> 9.—(1)    Where a supplier has engaged, is engaging or is likely to engage in an unfair practice, the District Court or High Court may, on the application of a specified body

> …

> (b)    grant an injunction restraining the supplier from engaging in the unfair practice;

> …

> (2)    Where an application is made to the District Court or High Court for the grant of a declaration or an injunction under subsection (1), the power of the Court to grant the declaration or injunction may be exercised —

>> (a)    if the Court is satisfied that the supplier has engaged in the unfair practice, whether or not it appears to the Court that the supplier intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in the unfair practice; or

>> (b)    if it appears to the Court that, in the event that a declaration or an injunction is not granted, it is likely that the supplier will engage in the unfair practice, whether or not the supplier has previously engaged in the unfair practice and whether or not there is any likelihood of irreparable harm to any consumer or class of consumers if the supplier engages in the unfair practice.

46     As seen from a comparison of the plain wording of sections 9(1)(b) and 9(2) in the CPFTA and in the 2003 Act, they are, in substance, identical.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46)

47     During the Second Reading of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Bill in 2003, Mr Raymond Lim (then the Minister of State for Trade and Industry) briefly explained sections 9(1)(b) and (2) of the 2003 Act as follows:[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47)

> _Some traders may persist in unconscionable practices_ which are detrimental to consumers and the reputation of our retail sector. _Clause 9 of the Bill therefore provides for a District Court or a High Court, on the application of a specified body, to grant an injunction against a trader_. CASE and the Singapore Tourism Board will be appointed as specified bodies under the Act to look after the interests of local consumers and tourists respectively. Before filing an injunction, the specified bodies must obtain the endorsement of an Injunction Proposals Review Panel. _This Panel will review whether there is a public interest to be safeguarded through the injunction_, and serve as an objective and independent check on the specified bodies.

> \[Emphasis added\]

48     The Minister’s comments evince that the Court’s power to grant injunctions restraining unfair practices is primarily intended to safeguard a public interest, such as to prevent errant suppliers from persisting in such practices.

49     Sections 9(1)(b) and 9(2) of the 2003 Act were in turn adapted from section 326 of the Securities and Futures Act (the “SFA”), section 28 of the Hazardous Waste (Control of Export, Import and Transit) Act (the “HWA”), and section 150 of Victoria (Australia)’s Fair Trading Act 1999 (the “Victorian Act”).[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48) These provisions as well as section 149 of the Victorian Act are, in substance, identical to sections 9(1)(b) and 9(2) of the 2003 Act.

50     There are no local reported decisions on when the Court should exercise its discretion under section 326 of the SFA, section 28 of the HWA or their successor provisions, to grant an injunction. On the other hand, sections 149 and 150 of the Victorian Act are modelled after section 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the “TPA”).[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) Section 80 of the TPA and its present equivalent – section 232 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (the “CCA”) – have been the subject of extensive judicial scrutiny by the Australian courts. I therefore turn to these provisions and Australian caselaw on the same.

#### The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the Competition and Consumer Act 2010

51     Part V Division 1 of the TPA addresses unfair practices by a supplier in a consumer transaction. Of particular relevance are sections 53(e) and (f), which address the types of unfair practices found to have been committed by the defendants in these proceedings. These sections prohibit a corporation from making a false or misleading representation with respect to the price of goods or services, or concerning the need for any goods or services.

52     Sections 80(1) and (4) of the TPA provide for the availability of injunctive relief for contraventions of, among other things, Part V of the TPA. It can be seen, from the quoted extracts of these sections below, that they are _in pari materia_ to sections 9(1)(b) and 9(2) of the CPFTA:

> (1)    Subject to subsections (1A), (1AAA) and (1B), _where_, on the application of the Commission or any other person, _the Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct that constitutes or would constitute_:

>> (a)     _a contravention of_ any of the following provisions:

>>> (i)     _a provision of Part_ IV, IVA, IVB or _V_;

> …

> _the Court may grant an injunction_ in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.

> …

> (4)     _The power of the Court to grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised_:

>> (a)     _whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind_;

>> (b)    whether or not the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; and

>> (c)    whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first-mentioned person engages in conduct of that kind.

> \[Emphasis added\]

53     Sections 29(1)(i) and (l) of the CCA is substantially identical to sections 53(e) and (f) of the TPA, while sections 232(1) and (4) of the CCA are substantially identical to sections 80(1) and (4) of the TPA.

54     One of the seminal cases on section 80 of the TPA is _Re ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] FCA 474</span> (“_ICI_”). In that case, the Federal Court of Australia eloquently set out the following statements regarding the nature and purpose of that provision (collectively, the “ICI Statements”):

> (a)     “_Section 80 is essentially a public interest provision_. Conduct of the kind proscribed by both \[Parts\] IV and V may be detrimental to the public interest because many persons can be affected and considerable loss or damage may be sustained by them. The public nature of the injunctive powers conferred upon the court by s 80 is exemplified also by the provision in subs (1) as to the persons who may seek an injunction. This right is conferred upon the Minister, the Commission or “any other person” …”.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) (emphasis added)

> (b)     Section 80(4) is “_novel because \[it\] empower\[s\] the court to grant injunctive relief notwithstanding that the defendant has not previously engaged in the prohibited conduct or does not intend to engage in it again or to continue to engage in it or there is no imminent danger of substantial damage. Yet these are the traditional requirements for equitable injunctive relief_”.[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) It is “designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied (i.e. contraventions or proposed contraventions of \[Parts\] IV or V of the \[TPA\]), the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers, devoid of traditional constraints”. This is because “_traditional doctrine surrounding the grant of injunctive relief was developed primarily for the protection of private proprietary rights. Public interest injunctions are different_”.[^52] (emphasis added)

> (c)     Thus, “_there is room within the statutory framework and the policy that underlies it for an injunction which is intended_ not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but _to deter an offender from repeating the offence. Such deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of Court_” (emphasis added).[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) Moreover, _in the case of a particularly flagrant breach_, _even if there was no evidence to indicate the supplier’s intention to continue the contravening conduct, it might be appropriate to mark the Court's disapproval by an injunction_ (emphasis added).[^54]

> (d)     Nonetheless, section 80(4) is “_not an indication of a new statutory house, rather an old house with some modern extensions_”. The section “_does not mean that the traditional equitable doctrines are irrelevant. For example, it must be relevant to consider questions of repetition of conduct or whether it has ever occurred before, or whether imminent substantial damage is likely: but the absence of any one or more of these elements is not fatal to the grant of an injunction under s 80_”[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55) (emphasis added). Furthermore, the Court’s power to grant an injunction must still be exercised judicially and sensibly.[^56]

55     The ICI Statements have been endorsed in subsequent decisions of the Australian courts: see, for example, _Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd_ (2007) 161 FCR 513 at \[100\], \[102\], \[103\] (“_Dataline_”); _Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd v Tonnex International Pty Ltd (No 2)_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] FCA 675</span> at \[23\] (“_Dynamic Supplies_”).

56     Subsequent decisions of the Australian courts have also elaborated on the factors to be considered in deciding whether to grant an injunction restraining an unfair practice. The following key principles may be distilled from those decisions (collectively, the “Post ICI Principles”).

> (a)    Relevant factors to be taken into account in the Court’s exercise of its discretion include:

>> (i)    whether the TPA or the CCA (as the case may be) needs to be supplemented by the availability of sanctions applicable to contempt of court;

>> (ii)    _the contraventions found_. This entails consideration of, among others:

>>> (A)    the _nature and extent_ of the contravening conduct;

>>> (B)    the _amount of damage caused_ by such conduct;

>>> (C)    the _degree of deliberateness or carelessness involved_ in such conduct;

>>> (D)    the circumstances in which such conduct took place, including _whether it was brought about by senior management or at a lower level_;

>>> (E)     _whether the defendant had a culture conducive to compliance with its obligations under the TPA or the CCA (as the case may be), or had instead shown a cavalier attitude towards such obligations_;

>> (iii)    _the risk of similar contraventions in the future_ and the utility of an injunction in minimising that risk. Some factors which are useful in this assessment include:

>>> (A)     _whether the defendant had prior contraventions_ of the TPA or the CCA;

>>> (B)     _whether the defendant had a culture of compliance_ with the TPA or the CCA (as the case may be); and

>>> (C)     _whether the defendant had co-operated with the authorities in their investigations, and the defendant’s approach to defending the proceedings_;

>> (iv)    _whether the contravening conduct was intended, isolated and/or occurred many years_ before the enforcement proceedings; and

>> (v)    the clarity and specificity of the injunction:

> see _Re Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Limited_ <span class="citation">\[1984\] FCA 363</span> (“_Mobil Oil_”) at \[22\]; _Dynamic Supplies_ at \[26\] – \[27\]; _Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TPG Internet Pty Ltd (No 2)_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] FCA 629</span> at \[18\] (“_TPG_”); _Poa Enterprises Pty Ltd v Chemist Warehouse Southport_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] QSC 316</span> at \[32\] (“_Poa Enterprises_”); _Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Kogan Australia Pty Ltd (No 2)_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] FCA 1751</span> at \[40\] (“_Kogan_”).

> (b)    While Parliament has provided for an injunction as a possible remedy, _it is doubtful, in the face of the statutory sanctions applicable to contravening conduct, whether Parliament intended injunctions to be a remedy granted in the ordinary course. Normally, it is only where there is a real risk of further misconduct that injunctive relief is contemplated_. An injunction should not be seen as a necessary vindication of the applicant’s conduct in bringing the proceedings: other relief may better serve that purpose. It also may not be appropriate to grant an injunction solely for the purpose of creating the possibility of imprisonment, when Parliament has not provided for imprisonment in connection with a contravention: see _Dataline_ at \[109\], \[110\] and \[114\]; _Kogan_ at \[40\].

> (c)    Thus, the Australian courts have readily granted injunctive relief where there is a real risk that the defendant will repeat the contravening conduct, particularly where the conduct in question is seriously misleading and will affect a large consumer base: see, for example, _TPG_ at \[24\] – \[27\]. Conversely, the Australian courts have been slow to grant injunctive relief if the risk of repetition of the contravening conduct is low, for example:

>> (i)    where there has been an unintentional contravention, or an isolated intentional contravention, of the TPA or the CCA (as the case may be), especially if the defendant had co-operated with the authorities in their investigations; or

>> (ii)   where the contravention had occurred many years prior to the enforcement proceedings, and there has been no further contravening conduct or the defendant is no longer in a position where contravention is likely: see _Mobil Oil_ at \[22\]; _Dataline_ at \[109\]; _Poa Enterprises_ at \[32\]; _Kogan_ at \[40\].

> (d)    While prevention of future misconduct may be the most common reason for granting injunctive relief, _there may be other reasons necessitating such relief. The likely severity of the consequences of an improbable future breach is one example_: see _Dataline_ at \[108\]. Conduct of the defendant which shows _a cavalier approach to its legal obligations to adhere to the norms of conduct prescribed in the TPA_, such as a preparedness to pursue its marketing objectives at the expense of misleading consumers, _is another example_: see _Dynamic Supplies_ at \[26\] – \[27\].

> (emphasis added)

#### The applicable legal principles

57     In my view, given that sections 9(1)(b) and 9(2) of the CPFTA are _in pari materia_ to section 80 of the TPA, the ICI Statements are instructive to the exercise of the Court’s discretion to grant injunctive relief under the CPFTA.

58     I therefore ought to bear in mind the following principles drawn from the ICI Statements, in exercising my discretion:

> (a)     Injunctive relief was developed by the courts of equity primarily to protect private proprietary rights. On the other hand, injunctions under section 9 of the CPFTA serve a different purpose of protecting a public interest, as made clear by Minister Raymond Lim’s remarks reproduced at \[47\] above. Hence, the absence of factors which are relevant to the grant of equitable injunctive relief – such as the risk of repetition of the contravening conduct and the prospect of imminent substantial harm – are not fatal to the grant of an injunction under section 9.

> (b)     It follows from the aforesaid point that injunctive relief under section 9 may be granted not simply to restrain an apprehended repetition of an unfair practice, but for other purposes such as to deter a supplier from repeating the unfair practice or to mark the Court’s disapproval of the unfair practice, particularly where the practice in question is especially egregious.

> (c)     Nonetheless, whether there is a real risk of repetition of the unfair practice and/or imminent substantial harm in the event the supplier is not injuncted, is still relevant to the Court’s exercise of its discretion under section 9. This is evident from Minister Raymond Lim’s remarks that introducing injunctive relief into the CPFTA would serve to prevent errant suppliers from persisting in such practices: see \[47\] above. That these factors remain relevant is entirely consistent with the public interest nature of section 9 injunctions. After all, it is conceivable that the public interest may be drawn into the picture where the supplier intends to continue perpetrating its unfair practices to the detriment of its consumers.

59     As regards the Post ICI Principles, I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that the differences between the statutory regimes in Australia and Singapore mean that these principles should not be applied blindly by the Singapore courts. In particular, the caution in _Dataline_ – that injunctions should not be granted in the ordinary course in view of the statutory sanctions available for contravening conduct – should not apply because the CPFTA does not impose as extensive sanctions for unfair practices as the TPA or the CCA. To elaborate:

> (a)     Under the TPA and CCA, there are a myriad of sanctions available for unfair practices, quite apart from injunctions. Using the unfair practice of making false or misleading representations about the price of, or the need for, any goods or services as an example:

>> (i)       It is an offence to engage in such conduct. The maximum penalty for such an offence is AUD 2.1 million under the TPA,[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) and AUD 1.1 million for a body corporate under the CCA.[^58]

>> (ii)       Alternatively, the Court may order the defendant to pay the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission a pecuniary penalty of up to AUD 2.1 million per contravention under the TPA, or AUD 1.1 million per contravention under the CCA for a body corporate. If the defendant fails to do so, the Commission may recover the penalty through civil action commenced within six years after the contravention.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59)

>> (iii)       Furthermore, the Court may make non-punitive orders in relation to a person who has engaged in such unfair practices, such as community service orders and probation orders.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) A community service order could entail requiring the person to make available a training video which explains his obligations under the TPA, or to carry out a community awareness program to address the needs of consumers when purchasing the product for which he had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct.[^61] A probation order could entail directing the person to establish a compliance program and/or an education and training program for his employees, which is designed to ensure their awareness of the responsibilities and obligations in relation to the contravening conduct.[^62]

>> (iv)       Moreover, the Commission may accept a written undertaking from a supplier regarding unfair practices. If the undertaking is breached, the Commission may apply to the Court for various orders, such as directing the supplier to comply with the undertaking.[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

> (b)     It is due to the availability of these wide-ranging sanctions that the Australian courts have taken the stance that:

>> (i)       a relevant factor in determining whether to grant an injunction is whether the existing sanctions available for the unfair practice need to be supplemented by the availability of the range of sanctions applicable to contempt of court; and

>> (ii)       injunctions are not a remedy granted in the ordinary course, but as a last resort; and

>> (iii)       it is not appropriate to grant an injunction solely for the purpose of creating the possibility of imprisonment when that has not been contemplated by Parliament;

> (c)     By contrast, in Singapore, leaving aside any private right of action a consumer may have against an errant supplier, injunctions and accompanying orders are the only practical remedy available to restrain unfair practices.

>> (i)       A declaration that a supplier has committed an unfair practice _per se_ has no teeth. By contrast, the grant of an injunction comes with the prospect of liability for contempt of court in the event that the supplier breaches the injunction. During the Second Reading of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) (Amendment) Bill in 2016, Dr Koh Poh Koon (then the Minister of State for Trade and Industry) had assured members of Parliament that “errant businesses who flout injunction orders are liable to be charged with contempt of court”, which is “a criminal offence which could result in a fine and/or imprisonment”_._[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64)

>> (ii)       Unlike the TPA or the CCA, the CPFTA does not prohibit unfair practices[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65), criminalise unfair practices, or give the Court the option of imposing pecuniary penalties or non-punitive orders on suppliers who commit unfair practices. Moreover, while the CPFTA allows the plaintiff to invite a supplier to enter into a VCA[^66], it does not allow the plaintiff to apply for a court order directing the supplier to comply with the VCA in the event that the supplier breaches the VCA. In the event of such a breach, the plaintiff’s only remedy is to apply to the Court for an injunction.

60     Nonetheless, the rest of the Post ICI Principles are helpful to the Court’s assessment of whether injunctive relief should be granted under section 9(1)(b) of the CPFTA. To provide some illustrations of this point:

> (a)     The nature and extent of the contraventions at hand, the underlying causes of the contraventions, the amount of harm they have caused, and whether there is a real risk that similar contraventions will be committed in the future (_cf_ \[56(a)(ii)-(iv)\] above), are plainly relevant in determining whether there is a public interest to be safeguarded by a section 9 injunction. Of course, the absence of any one of these factors is not necessarily fatal to the grant of an injunction. The weight given to each of these factors will depend on the circumstances of the case at hand. But the relevance of these factors cannot seriously be disputed.

> (b)     Furthermore, it is a sound general principle that the greater the risk of repetition of the contravening conduct and/or the more serious the consequences of such conduct, the more readily the Court will grant injunctive relief under section 9, and _vice versa_ (_cf_ \[56(c)\] above).

61     On this note, I observe that all the matters relied upon in the parties’ submissions for or against the grant of injunctive relief fall within the rubric of the ICI Statements and/or the Post ICI Principles, with two exceptions. That is, the defendants’ reliance on _one_, the public’s alleged awareness of these proceedings from online media coverage, and _two_, Ms Cai and Ms Tan’s pursuit of civil remedies against them, as factors militating against the grant of injunctive relief. I therefore turn to address these two factors.

62     With respect, I do not agree that public awareness of these proceedings from online media coverage is a factor militating against the grant of injunctive relief. Even assuming that the media reports on my decision in these proceedings, it will, at best, mean that some members of the public are notified that the defendants have been found to have committed unfair practices. However, the segment of the public who is unaware of such media coverage will be none the wiser. More importantly, some level of public knowledge that the defendants have been found to have committed unfair practices does not have the same efficacy as an injunction in protecting the public interest. The reason for this is obvious. Unlike an injunction, mere public knowledge of the defendants’ wrongdoing does not come with the prospect of criminal liability for contempt of court, and therefore lacks the deterrent effect that an injunction is intended to have.

63     Neither do I think that Ms Cai and Ms Tan’s pursuit of civil remedies (in this case, seeking refunds) against the defendants is a factor militating against the grant of injunctive relief. The civil remedies a consumer has against an errant supplier for unfair practices serve a different purpose from injunctions granted under section 9(1)(b) of the CPFTA. The key purpose of such civil remedies is to compensate the consumer for the losses he has suffered as a result of the unfair practice committed against him. In other words, they serve to put the consumer in the position he would have been if the unfair practice had not been committed. On the other hand, section 9 injunctions are intended to protect a public interest, such as to restrain an apprehended repetition of an unfair practice by a supplier. Thus, even if the aggrieved consumer is successful in obtaining civil remedies against the supplier, this _per se_ would not negate the need for injunctive relief, which turns on different considerations.

64     This is not to say that the defendants’ response when civil remedies were sought against them for their unfair practices, is irrelevant to the Court’s exercise of its discretion to grant injunctive relief. It will be seen from \[83\] – \[86\] below that the extent of the defendants’ co-operation or lack thereof, in the face of reasonable requests by Ms Cai and Ms Tan for refunds, can be an indicator of whether there is a real risk that they will persist in their unfair practices.

### The Court’s discretion to grant accompanying orders under section 9(4) of the CPFTA

#### The relevant provisions of the CPFTA

65     Moving on to accompanying orders, section 9(1)(c) of the CPFTA provides that if the Court grants a declaration or an injunction under section 9(1), it may make, in addition, one or more of the accompanying orders set out in section 9(4).

66     The full suite of accompanying orders is set out in section 9(4) of the CPFTA read with the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) (Notifiable Events) Regulations 2016 (the “2016 Regulations”). These include orders that the supplier must:

> (a)     periodically publish details of the declaration or injunction in such form and manner and at such intervals as will secure prompt and adequate publicity for the declaration or injunction: see section 9(4)(a) of the CPFTA;

> (b)     before entering into a consumer transaction with any consumer, notify the consumer in writing about the declaration or injunction, and obtain the consumer’s written acknowledgement of the said notice: see section 9(4)(b) of the CPFTA;

> (c)     incorporate notice of the declaration or injunction into its invoice and receipts to consumers: see section 9(4)(c) of the CPFTA;

> (d)     notify the plaintiff within 14 days of certain changes to the supplier’s business and the presence of certain arrangements, including but not limited to: (i) a change in its premises or number of premises, (ii) a change in its name or the name under which it carries on business, (iii) its conversion from a firm or private company to a limited liability partnership, (iv) that it is under an arrangement reconstruction or amalgamation, a compromise or arrangement with its creditors, a receivership, judicial management, or has been ordered to be wound up, (v) any arrangement for it to participate in a trade fair, and (vi) a change in its board of directors or in the person(s) who hold 15% or more of total voting power or shares in the supplier: see section 9(4)(d) of the CPFTA, read with paragraph 2 of the 2016 Regulations.

67     Most of these accompanying orders[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67) may only last for a “specified period”, which is defined in section 9(7) of the CPFTA as a period not exceeding five years. Where the Court makes two or more accompanying orders mentioned in sections 9(4)(a), (b), (c) or (d), the specified period in respect of each of the orders must be the same: see section 9(6) of the CPFTA.

68     It is not disputed that the accompanying orders sought by the plaintiff fall within section 9(4) of the CPFTA read with the 2016 Regulations.

#### The genesis and rationale for the availability of accompanying orders

69     When section 9(1)(c) was introduced in its original form in the 2003 Act, it only permitted the Court to “make a further order requiring the supplier to advertise to the public … particulars of any declaration or injunction granted against the supplier under paragraph (a) or (b)”, which is the predecessor of section 9(4)(a) of the CPFTA (see \[66(a)\] above). In other words, the Court did not have the power under the 2003 Act to make any other type of accompanying order that is now available under section 9(4) of the CPFTA read with the 2016 Regulations.

70     This state of affairs was overhauled in 2016, when sections 9(4) – (14) of the CPFTA were introduced, and section 9(1)(c) was amended to allow the Court to grant “any one or more of the additional orders set out in subsection (4)” (collectively, the “2016 Amendments”).

71     In explaining these amendments in the Second Reading of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) (Amendment) Bill in 2016, Dr Koh Poh Koon (then the Minister of State for Trade and Industry) made the following crucial remarks:[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68)

> The review \[on the CPFTA conducted by MTI in 2015\] found that there is a gap in the current injunction process. So among the whole spectrum, we identified a gap in the injunction process. It is slow as CASE and STB have no investigation and enforcement powers, and hence face operational difficulties in gathering evidence to submit their applications to the Courts to file an injunction. _Some errant businesses have also side-stepped injunctions by closing their businesses and setting up new ones._

> …

> Let me now move on to the other main amendments. These relate to additional measures which may be imposed by the Courts on errant businesses as part of the injunction orders.

> The Courts may make injunction orders which restrain errant businesses from engaging in unfair practices. _Clauses 4 and 5 provide for the additional measures or accompanying orders that a court may take or may make in addition to an injunction order. These accompanying orders serve to raise consumer awareness of errant businesses, both business entities and individuals, who are under injunction orders. They also make it harder for errant businesses to side-step injunction orders by closing business and setting up new ones under another person’s name. Taken together, the additional measures that the Courts may impose will enable SPRING to monitor these errant businesses, and take swift enforcement action if the orders are not complied with._

> \[After briefly explaining the types of accompanying orders introduced by Clauses 4 and 5\] _These are all aimed at raising consumers' awareness of a business under injunction._

> …

> Taken together, the requirements for errant retailers to publicise the injunction orders and notify consumers of the injunction order prior to entering into a transaction, as well as SPRING working with CASE to publish injunction orders will _serve to raise consumers’ awareness of retailers who are under injunction. Consumers can then decide if they still want to purchase from the retailer. This goes back to the principle of “caveat emptor”, buyers beware, with consumers exercising their choice and making informed purchasing decisions.”_

> …

> _I hope that the strengthening of the injunction will move more cases towards the front end of the spectrum – towards education, towards awareness, towards mediation and towards voluntary compliance agreements_. So, this should _send a signal to businesses who are even contemplating engaging in egregious behaviour to stop immediately and to go into voluntary compliance. This is what we hope to achieve._

> \[emphasis added\]

72     It is evident from these remarks that Parliament’s intention behind the introduction of a full suite of accompanying orders is threefold:

> (a)     One, to raise consumers’ awareness of suppliers who are under injunctions so that they can make informed purchasing decisions;

> (b)     Two, to enable the relevant authority (presently, the plaintiff) to monitor suppliers which are under injunctions and to take swift enforcement action if the injunctions are not complied with. This is achieved through, among other things, requiring such suppliers to report certain changes to their business to the plaintiff, thereby making it more difficult for them to sidestep injunction orders simply by closing their business and setting up new ones.

> (c)     Finally, to move cases towards the front end of the spectrum: towards education, mediation and VCAs. In other words, the accompanying orders are meant to have a deterrent effect on errant businesses who are either contemplating or already engaging in unfair practices.

#### The applicable legal principles

73     Given that Parliament has articulated the objectives for introducing a full suite of accompanying orders into the CPFTA, the Court should be guided by these objectives in deciding whether to grant any accompanying orders.

74     The defendants submit that the accompanying orders are unnecessary as consumers would already be protected by the grant of the injunctions and the accompanying orders would have a detrimental effect on their business. In my view, this submission is flawed as a matter of principle. It is based on the premise that parties who are under an injunction will comply with the injunction: see \[25(e)\] above. That is clearly a false premise. As counsel would be well aware, caselaw is full of real-life examples of parties who have breached court orders (including injunctions) and are thereafter made the subject of contempt proceedings.

75     Moreover, it is evident from the discussion in \[43\] – \[72\] above that accompanying orders do not serve the exact same purpose that injunctive relief do. Injunctions are intended to safeguard a public interest, for example, to restrain a supplier found to have engaged in an unfair practice from persisting in the unfair practice, or deter a supplier from committing a particular unfair practice. On the other hand, accompanying orders are intended to alert consumers to the fact that a supplier has committed unfair practices so that they can make informed purchasing decisions, to enhance the efficacy of the primary relief (i.e. the injunction) by preventing the supplier from sidestepping the injunction, and/or to operate as a general deterrent to other suppliers in the industry. Given the different purposes served by these two remedies, it does not assist the defendants to contend that accompanying orders are unnecessary because they have been injuncted.

76     The mere fact that accompanying orders may have a detrimental effect on a supplier’s business is also irrelevant. Those who commit unfair practices must face the consequences of their actions. If, on the facts of the case, the grant of accompanying orders would meet the objectives delineated by Parliament, it is no excuse for a supplier to say that the orders should not be granted because their business will be adversely affected.

### It is appropriate for the Court to grant the proposed injunctions

77     In my judgment, this is an appropriate case for the grant of injunctions against the defendants.

78     While the plaintiff has proven only two occasions of unfair practice (one against each defendant), the nature of these contraventions is moderately severe.

> (a)     Ms Chen and Ms Chong had deliberately misled Ms Cai and Ms Tan respectively into believing that they had fungal infection on their toenails. In this regard, Ms Chen and Ms Chong could not have held a genuine belief that these customers had fungal infection on their toenails, because they would have known, based on the Group’s SOP, that they could not diagnose fungal infection based solely on visual inspection. Ms Chong had also deliberately misled Ms Tan by omitting to mention that lip sticks and lip balms were included in the price of the Revised Treatment Package.

> (b)     The transaction amounts in question were also substantial for nail services: $1,677.76 in Ms Cai’s case and $11,401.92 in Ms Tan’s case.

79     Furthermore, there is a real risk that the defendants might commit similar contraventions in the future. I arrive at this view for two reasons.

80      _First_, given that Ms Lai is the sole training manager for the Group (see \[7\] above), and all employees in the Group are required to comply with the SOP (see \[30(a)\] above), the training of employees and the manner in which each Nail Palace outlet is to conduct its operations are clearly planned and decided at the Group level. In this regard, it is apparent from the following matters that the Group does not have adequate policies and practices in place to prevent the recurrence of the unfair practices which the defendants have committed.

81     For a start, on or about 23 December 2019 (the day after Ms Tan was misled into purchasing the Revised Treatment Package), she made a complaint with CASE regarding the said incident and CASE then alerted Nail Palace SM of the complaint. Yet, several months later in August 2020, the same type of unfair practice occurred in another Nail Palace outlet, Nail Palace BPP, to Ms Cai.

82     Furthermore, the defendants failed to adduce any evidence to show that effective measures have been taken by the Group, after Ms Tan’s and Ms Cai’s respective incidents, to prevent the recurrence of such unfair practices.

> (a)     Mr Cheng’s assertion that all the staff in the Group undergo through training to deal with issues of nail fungal infection, does not assist the defendants. Mr Cheng relied on a trainer’s manual to support his assertion. However, that trainer’s manual does not contain any express instruction that one should not diagnose fungal infection based solely on visual observation, much less explain the rationale behind such an instruction. Moreover, the authenticity of the manual is suspect for the following reasons:

>> (i)       On 29 July 2021, the plaintiff served its notice on Nail Palace Pte. Ltd. requiring the production of, among others, copies of all training materials of Nail Palace, including trainer’s personal copies and copies given to staff. On 18 August 2021, Nail Palace Pte. Ltd. replied, attaching what was described as the ‘training manual’ which consists of a PowerPoint file labelled ‘Staff Training Program’ and an excel sheet labelled ‘Service Steps with pic’. On 12 October 2021, Nail Palace Pte. Ltd. confirmed, in response to the plaintiff’s query, that it had no other training manuals containing information on how to detect the presence of and treat nail fungal infection.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69) No explanation was provided by Mr Cheng as to why the trainer’s manual exhibited in his affidavit was produced only months later, at a late stage of these proceedings.

>> (ii)       Moreover, the trainer’s manual is inconsistent with the Group’s SOP. It omits to mention that the staff need to use the ‘Fungusless test’ to test for and confirm the presence of a fungal infection, before they can inform a customer that he/she has such an infection and recommend any fungal treatment to the customer.

> (b)     Mr Cheng’s assertion about the implementation of a refund policy since 3 January 2020 is neither relevant nor credible.

>> (i)       The alleged policy is irrelevant because nothing in Mr Cheng’s evidence suggests that the policy is targeted at, and would be effective in, minimising the recurrence of the unfair practices which the defendants have been found to have committed. The only information in his affidavit regarding the nature of the policy is that it allows customers to seek a refund within five days of their purchase by sending an official refund request via email and paying an administrative charge of 10% and GST on the invoiced amount.

>> (ii)       In any event, I am not satisfied that the alleged policy had in fact been implemented. No objective evidence (such as email correspondence with customers, credit notes or receipts, evidencing the alleged refunds) was adduced to support the contents of the refund report. On the contrary, the defendants’ standard form invoice states that all purchases are non-refundable,[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70) and the defendants had relied on that clause to refuse to provide any refund to Ms Cai and Ms Tan.[^71] Moreover, the refund report is, at the very least, inaccurate in respect of Ms Cai and Ms Tan. The report stated that Ms Cai was refunded within five days [^72] when in reality, Nail Palace BPP had refused to refund her until after it was ordered to do so in the SCT Proceedings on 4 January 2021: see \[84\] below. The report also stated that the status of Ms Tan’s request for a refund was “\[p\]ending response from CASE”.[^73] That is untrue. It is evident from the email correspondence between Nail Palace and CASE that there was no pending reply from CASE because Nail Palace had consistently maintained that they had a strictly non-refundable policy and that there was no exception to that policy.[^74]

> (c)     Additionally, Mr Cheng’s assertion that Ms Chong was penalised for her mistake is wholly unsubstantiated.

83      _Second_, the defendants were uncooperative after Ms Tan and Ms Cai complained about the unfair practices committed against them.

84     I began with Nail Palace BPP’s conduct.

> (a)     When Ms Cai returned to Nail Palace BPP’s outlet on 29 August 2020 to seek a refund of the unused fungal treatment sessions on the ground that they had misled her into buying the Fungal Treatment Package, they refused her request, saying that her purchase was non-refundable.[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75)

> (b)     In their email exchanges with Ms Cai in September 2020, they reiterated their non-refundable policy and claimed that even after she underwent her first fungal treatment session with them on 16 August 2020, there are still signs of fungus on her toenail as evidenced by certain photographs.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) However, the feet in those photographs in fact belonged to someone else and not Ms Cai.[^77]

> (c)     Thereafter, Ms Cai filed a complaint with CASE regarding Nail Palace BPP’s unfair practices and sought CASE’s assistance to obtain a refund from them. CASE then invited them to attend a mediation session with her. But they did not respond to CASE’s invitation.[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78) As a result, Ms Cai was compelled to commence the SCT Proceedings to seek a refund on the ground that they had misled her into buying the Fungal Treatment Package.

> (d)     In the SCT Proceedings, Nail Palace BPP continued to insist that Ms Cai’s purchase was non-refundable and that there was fungus on her toenail during her visit to them on 16 August 2020.[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79) It was only after the tribunal magistrate granted Ms Cai’s claim and ordered them to refund her, that they made the refund. Even then, they made it difficult for Ms Cai to collect the refund by requiring her to sign a letter agreeing “not \[to\] hold any actions, claims, compensation against Nail Palace in future”, even though the tribunal magistrate did not impose any such pre-condition for the refund.[^80]

> (e)     Even in these proceedings, Nail Palace BPP unreasonably maintained that Ms Chen had not informed Ms Cai that she had fungal infection on her toenails on 16 August 2020. This was despite them having taken the contrary position in the SCT Proceedings.[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81)

85     As for Nail Palace SM’s conduct, it is undisputed that:

> (a)     Ms Tan had filed a complaint with CASE regarding Nail Palace SM’s unfair practices and sought CASE’s assistance to obtain a refund of the price of the Revised Treatment Package.[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82)

> (b)     From 24 December 2019 to 17 January 2020, CASE made numerous attempts on behalf of Ms Tan to seek a refund from Nail Palace SM, but they refused to offer any refund, citing their non-refundable policy.[\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83) This was despite the fact that Ms Tan had offered to return the lipstick, lip balm and Ag Tech spray (all of which were unused and still unopened), and had made compromises to her initial request for a refund by offering to bear the cost of the first fungal treatment session and by making multiple reductions to her proposed cash refund amount.[^84]

> (c)     Moreover, Nail Palace SM ignored and failed to accept CASE’s invitations for them to attend a mediation session with Ms Tan.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85)

86     In the premises, I find that the proposed injunctions are necessary to restrain _and_ deter the defendants from repeating the unfair practices which they are found to have committed.

### It is appropriate for the Court to grant the proposed accompanying orders, but for a limited duration

87     I move on to address the proposed accompanying orders.

88     Given the real risk that the defendants might persist in their unfair practices, it is important that:

> (a)      _One_, consumers are made aware of the existence and terms of the injunctions granted against the defendants through the Publication Order and the Consumer Notification & Consent Order. Such knowledge on the part of consumers will:

>> (i)       enable them to make an informed decision as to whether they still wish to purchase goods and services from the defendants;

>> (ii)       prevent them from falling prey in the event the defendants attempt to engage in similar unfair practices with them; and

>> (iii)       enable them to alert the authorities if the defendants make any such attempts in breach of the injunctions.

> (b)      _Two_, the plaintiff is placed in a position where it can effectively monitor the defendants, and take enforcement action if the injunctions are not complied it. The CCS Notification Order achieves that by, among other things, requiring the defendants to notify the plaintiff of any changes to their name or business premises; any changes in their board of directors; any winding up, judicial management or receivership orders made against them; and any arrangement they make to participate in trade fairs.

89     Moreover, the defendants have, through their uncooperativeness outlined at \[83\] – \[85\] above, refused to avail themselves of the options available at the front end of the spectrum, such as mediation. This has regrettably necessitated the expenditure of public resources to bring these proceedings. In my view, such uncooperative conduct is another factor supporting the grant of accompanying orders, bearing in mind that one of Parliament’s objectives behind the 2016 Amendments is to move more cases towards the front end of the spectrum: see \[72(c)\] above. Granting accompanying orders in this case would send a signal to businesses that insofar as they have engaged in unfair practices, they should avail themselves of the options at the front end of the spectrum. A failure to do so may count against them in subsequent enforcement proceedings brought under section 9 of the CPFTA.

90     In the premises, I find it entirely appropriate, and in line with Parliament’s objectives behind the 2016 Amendments, to grant the proposed accompanying orders _but_ with the following amendment.

91     The plaintiff has asked me to set the duration of the Consumer Notification & Consent Order and the CCS Notification Order at five years, which is the maximum permissible specified period under section 9(7) of the CPFTA. In this regard, counsel for the plaintiff informed me that it is the plaintiff’s “general policy” to seek a shorter specified period for accompanying orders if the errant supplier has already ceased business, but to seek the maximum specified period if the errant supplier is still actively in business (such as the defendants).

92     In my view, the duration of an accompanying order should be limited to that which is reasonably required to put a stop to the misconduct in question and/or to deter other suppliers from engaging in such misconduct. My view is reinforced by sections 9(8) read with 9(10) of the CPFTA, which grant the Court the power to extend the duration of any accompanying order made under sections 9(4)(a), (b), (c) or (d) to a maximum of 10 years[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86) in the event that a supplier fails to comply with the said order. The Court’s ability to grant such an extension strongly suggests that the duration of the accompanying orders granted must be calibrated to the misconduct at hand.

93     Flowing from this, the maximum specified period of five years for accompanying orders should, as a general principle, be reserved for the most egregious cases. One possible example of such a case is where the supplier has engaged in an unfair practice which has caused or is likely to cause severe and/or widespread detriment to the public, and has made little or no effort to remedy the unfair practice. In that scenario, imposing accompanying orders for the full five years may be justified as being necessary to eliminate the risk of repetition of the unfair practice by the errant supplier and to deter that supplier and/or others in the industry from engaging in the unfair practice.

94     By contrast, where the unfair practice is less reprehensible and not as widespread, and/or the supplier has taken steps which are likely to assist in preventing the recurrence of the unfair practice, the imposition of a shorter specified period may be justified even if the supplier is still actively in business. Exactly how long the specified period should be would depend on the specific facts of the case at hand. There is no hard and fast rule. In this regard, the “general policy” of the plaintiff described by counsel seems, with respect, too blunt to be capable of properly calibrating the duration of accompanying orders to the misconduct at hand.

95     In my judgment, the unfair practices found in the present case do not fall within the category of most egregious cases, as they were committed only on two occasions against two individuals and were of moderate severity. But at the same time, these unfair practices were committed deliberately and there is a real risk that the defendants may commit them again in the future for the reasons I have explained earlier. Hence, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, I find that the appropriate duration for the Consumer Notification & Consent Order and the CCS Notification Order is two years.

### Matters raised by the plaintiff which I did not take into account

96     For the avoidance of doubt, in determining the appropriate remedies, I did not take into account the plaintiff’s assertions that:

> (a)     At least 9 of the 20 customers in the refund report had filed complaints with CASE for various unfair practices by the Group. Even after CASE intervened, the Group refused to cooperate and refunded only one of the customers.

> (b)     Apart from the customers listed in the refund report, many other customers had complained to CASE since 3 January 2020 about unfair practices by the Group (including the defendants), including those relating to fungal treatments.

97     These assertions are inadmissible hearsay as the plaintiff did not call these customers (apart from Ms Cai and Ms Tan), or the relevant representatives from CASE, to give evidence on the unfair practices which had been committed against these customers and how the Group responded after being notified by CASE of these customers’ complaints. Moreover, no details were provided on the nature of each of the alleged unfair practices, the circumstances in which they were committed, and which Nail Palace outlet(s) had committed them. I was therefore unable to assess the relevance of these assertions to the present case.

98     I also did not take into account the Group’s refusal to accept CASE’s invitations to enter into a VCA. While it is undisputed that the Group had refused to accept CASE’s invitations to enter into a VCA, there is no evidence before me on the terms of the proposed VCA. In the premises, I could not assess whether the terms of the proposed VCA were appropriately pitched or overly onerous, and consequently, whether the Group’s refusal to enter into the proposed VCA was unreasonable.

99     It is unfortunate that the plaintiff failed to properly adduce evidence of the assertions set out at \[96\] above and the terms of the proposed VCA, and to demonstrate their relevance to the present case. Had the plaintiff done so, it might have provided sufficient basis for me to impose a longer duration for the Consumer Notification & Consent Order and the CCS Notification Order.

## Conclusion

100    In conclusion, the plaintiff has succeeded largely in its applications against each defendant. I therefore grant the following orders:

> (a)     a declaration that each of the defendants has engaged in an unfair practice within the meaning of section 4(d), read with paragraph 1B of the Second Schedule, to the CPFTA, by making a misleading representation concerning the need for fungal treatment(s) or fungal treatment package(s); and

> (b)     a declaration that Nail Palace SM has also engaged in an unfair practice within the meaning of section 4(a) of the CPFTA, by omitting to inform a consumer that certain products were included in the price of a treatment package, thereby resulting in the consumer being misled;

> (c)     that Nail Palace BPP be restrained from engaging in the unfair practice referred to in subparagraph (a) above;

> (d)     that Nail Palace SM be restrained from engaging in the unfair practices referred to in subparagraphs (a)-(b) above;

> (e)     that each of the defendants publish, at their own expense, within fourteen days from the date of this decision, details of the declaration and injunction granted against them, by way of a full page public notice in the Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao, Berita Harian, and Tamil Murasu;

> (f)     that each of the defendants must, before any consumer enters into a contract in relation to a consumer transaction with them during a period of two years from the date of this decision:

>> (i)       notify the consumer in writing about the declaration and injunction in force against that defendant; and

>> (ii)       obtain the consumer’s written acknowledgement of receipt of the said notice;

> (g)     that each of the defendants must, for a period of two years from the date of this decision, notify the plaintiff in writing within fourteen days of the occurrence of any of the following events:

>> (i)       a change in the premises or number of premises at which the defendant carries on its business as a supplier;

>> (ii)       the conversion of the defendant from a private company to a limited liability partnership under section 21 of the Limited Liability Partnerships Act;

>> (iii)       the defendant undergoing any arrangement, reconstruction or amalgamation under Part VII of the Companies Act;

>> (iv)       an order being made under section 71 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 approving a compromise or an arrangement between the defendant and its creditors;

>> (v)       the defendant being subjected to receivership under Part 6 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018;

>> (vi)       the defendant being subjected to judicial management under Part 7 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018;

>> (vii)       the defendant being subjected to winding up under Part 8 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018;

>> (viii)       a change in the defendant’s name or the name under which the defendant is carrying on business;

>> (ix)       any arrangement by the defendant to participate in a trade fair;

>> (x)       if the defendant adopts for its business a new name, symbol or design, any arrangement by the defendant to carry out any activity for the purpose of identifying its business with that new name, symbol or design;

>> (xi)       a change in the board of directors of the defendant or a change in the person or persons who hold directly or indirectly 15% or more of the total voting power or total issued shares in the defendant; or

>> (xii)       any shareholder of the defendant entering into an arrangement under which that shareholder holds on behalf of another person any profits, gains or dividends derived from the carrying on of the defendant’s business.

101    I will hear parties on costs if their incidence and amount cannot be agreed upon within 21 days of this judgment.
