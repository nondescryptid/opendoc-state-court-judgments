### District Judge Lim Mei Yee Elaine:

## Introduction

1       This action arises from a flooding incident on 19 March 2018 (the “Incident”) in the plaintiff’s flat at Blk 127 Yishun Street 11 #XXX Singapore 760127 (the “Premises”). The defendant was the contractor engaged by the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) to renovate, among other things, two toilets in the Premises under the Home Improvement Program (“HIP”). On the day of the Incident, the defendant had laid the pipes of the two toilets at the Premises. Subsequently that evening, water leaked from a dislodged pipe in the common toilet of the Premises, resulting in the flooding of the Premises and the flat below it. The flooding caused substantial damage to the items in the Premises.

2       After the Incident, on or about 20 March 2018, the defendant’s workers helped the plaintiff to, among other things, shift the items and furniture in the Premises, clean up and/or dry the Premises, items and furniture, and solve the water seepage issue which had caused the flooding. The plaintiff also packed and moved her items into boxes (so that her damaged furniture could be disposed of and/or replaced) and cleaned up the Premises.

## The parties’ cases

3       In a nutshell, the plaintiff claims that in the course of packing and/or moving the items in the Premises, her pre-existing cervical spondylosis was aggravated and became symptomatic. She sued the defendant in negligence for causing the flooding and consequently, the damage to the items and the personal injuries she sustained in the course of packing and/or moving the items.

4       The defendant concedes that its negligence had caused the flooding and consequently, damage to the items in the Premises.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) However, the defendant disputes that its negligence had caused the plaintiff to suffer injuries. The defendant submits that those injuries were caused wholly or contributed to by the plaintiff’s failure to request for assistance to pack and move the items and the unsafe manner in which she packed and moved the items. Furthermore, those injuries were too remote. The defendant also disputes the quantification of certain heads of the plaintiff’s claims arising out of those injuries.

## Issues to be determined

5       The trial before me was unbifurcated.

6       Based on the parties’ cases, there are three issues to be determined:

> (a)     Were the plaintiff’s injuries caused or contributed to by the defendant’s negligence or her own conduct?

> (b)     Were the plaintiff’s injuries foreseeable and not too remote?

> (c)     In the event the Court finds that the defendant is wholly or partially liable for the plaintiff’s injuries, the quantum of damages the plaintiff is entitled to.

7       After considering the pleadings, evidence and submissions, I find that the plaintiff’s injuries were foreseeable and were wholly caused by the defendant’s negligence. I assess her entitlement to damages as follows:

8       I set out below the reasons for my decision.

## Issue 1: Were the plaintiff’s injuries caused or contributed to by the defendant’s negligence or her own conduct

9       Two questions arise for my determination under the broad issue of causation and contributorily negligence:

> (a)     Has causation in fact – namely, the but-for test – been established?

> (b)     Was the plaintiff’s failure to request for assistance to pack and move the items, and the manner in which she packed and moved the items, contributorily negligent or a _novus actus interveniens_?

10     The applicable legal principles are well settled:

> (a)     To succeed in her claim for negligence, the plaintiff must satisfy both tests of causation in fact and causation in law: see _Greenway Environmental Waste Management Pte Ltd v Cramoil Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 203</span> (“_Greenway_”) at \[148\].[^2]

> (b)     For causation in fact, the plaintiff must show, on the balance of probabilities, that but for the defendant’s negligence, she would not have been injured. In applying the but-for test to determine whether the defendant’s negligence was a cause of the loss, one should eliminate such conduct mentally and consider whether the loss would still have occurred. If the loss would not have occurred when such conduct is eliminated, the conduct is a _condicio sine qua non_ for the loss: see _Greenway_ at \[149\], \[152\].[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

> (c)     The doctrine of _novus actus interveniens_ is an aspect of causation in law. In determining whether the plaintiff’s conduct constitutes a _novus actus interveniens_, the test is whether her conduct was so wholly unreasonable that it eclipses the original wrongdoing and may be deemed to be a wholly independent cause of the damage: see _Greenway_ at \[152\], \[153\], \[180\].[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) In this regard, the more voluntary the act, the less reasonable it is and the more potent its causative effect. However, even deliberate acts may be involuntary, for example, where a person is forced to make a response to a situation brought about by the defendant’s negligence and such a response is foreseeable. Careless behaviour is generally less potent causally than a deliberate act: see _Clerk & Lindsell on Torts_, 22nd ed. (Sweet & Maxwell, 2017) (“_Clerk & Lindsell_”) at \[2-108\].[^5]

> (d)     Turning to the defence of contributorily negligence, it applies where the cause of the plaintiff’s loss is a combination of her fault and the defendant’s wrongdoing. The defendant must show that the plaintiff ought to have objectively foreseen that her failure to act prudently could result in hurting herself, and failed to take reasonable measures to guard against that foreseeable harm. The standard of care expected of the plaintiff is measured against a person of ordinary prudence: see _Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 944</span> at \[18\], \[20\].[^6] The situation that the plaintiff was placed in as a result of the defendant’s conduct should be considered in determining whether the plaintiff acted reasonably: see _Clerk & Lindsell_ at \[3-92\].[^7] Thus, the fact that the plaintiff had to take a risk does not amount to contributory negligence if the risk were created by the defendant’s negligence and was one which a reasonably prudent man in the plaintiff’s position would take. Moreover, mere errors of judgment do not ordinarily count against a plaintiff, as a person’s conduct in the face of sudden emergency cannot be judged from the standpoint of what would have been reasonable in light of hindsight. There is a distinction between mere heedlessness or errors of judgment on the one hand, and culpable neglect on the other hand: see _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 377</span> (“_Parno_”) at \[64\].[^8]

### Causation in fact is established

11     In my judgment, causation in fact is established.

12     It is the plaintiff’s unchallenged evidence that although she was diagnosed with cervical spondylosis in 2009, she recovered in one month after undergoing occupational therapy at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, such that for the span of more than eight years from 2010 until late April 2018, she did not feel any pain from her condition. In fact, in 2014, she had managed her move into the Premises by herself, and between December 2014 and the date of the Incident, she had been serving in her church as a server/usher on alternate Sundays where she assisted in setting up the venue and ushering congregation members to their seats.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) However, in or around late April 2018, after a month of packing and moving the items in the Premises, she started experiencing pain over her right shoulder, right upper back and numbness over her right hand.[^10]

13     I accept the plaintiff’s aforesaid evidence, which is consistent with the documentary evidence before me. Nothing in the documents indicates that the plaintiff’s cervical spondylosis had been symptomatic between 2010 and the date of the Incident. On the contrary, Dr Lor Kah Ho Kelvin (“Dr Lor”)’s medical report dated 12 October 2018 recorded that according to the plaintiff, her pain over her right shoulder and right upper back, associated with numbness over the right hand, had started one week prior to her visit to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“KTPH”)’s Emergency Department on 29 April 2018.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) Consistent with this record, the documents show that the plaintiff had visited a physiotherapy clinic for treatment only on 26 April 2018, a few days before she visited KTPH’s Emergency Department.[^12]

14     The flooding of the Premises was precisely the reason why the plaintiff had to pack and move the items in the Premises. The medical evidence is clear that in the course of packing and moving the items, the plaintiff had likely aggravated her pre-existing cervical spondylosis. In particular, it is Dr Lor’s unchallenged evidence that it is reasonable that the repetitive movements the plaintiff undertook during the packing and moving of her items resulted in aggravation of her cervical spondylosis by triggering the sensitivity in her nerves.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) Dr Cen Xiaoping Dawn (“Dr Cen”), who saw the plaintiff at KTPH’s Orthopedic Specialist Outpatient Clinic on 18 May 2018, also took a similar view that the plaintiff’s packing and moving of her items had likely exacerbated her pre-existing condition.[^14]

15     If the defendant had not been negligent in causing the flooding, the Premises would not have been flooded in the first place and the plaintiff would not have had to pack and move the items in the Premises. I therefore find that but for the defendant’s negligence, the plaintiff would not have been injured in the course of packing and moving the items.

### The plaintiff’s conduct was not contributorily negligent or a novus actus interveniens

16     The defendant submits that the plaintiff had wholly caused her injuries or alternatively, had contributed to the same in the region of 70%.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) The crux of this submission may be summarised as follows:[^16]

> (a)     The plaintiff was already 54 years old at the time of the Incident and was aware that she had cervical spondylosis. Despite her old age and condition, she did not request anyone’s assistance to pack or unpack the items in the Premises, or to move the small, the medium and the Toyogo boxes, and some of the big boxes, into which she had packed her items. Instead, she did the packing, unpacking and moving by herself despite knowing that the repetitive actions she undertook in the process were done for too long. If she had requested the defendant’s assistance in packing, unpacking and moving her items, or requested the defendant to reimburse her for the cost incurred to engage a helper/mover, the defendant would have obliged.

> (b)     Moreover, the plaintiff moved the boxes in a clearly unsafe manner by carrying boxes weighing up to 7 kg by herself, bending down close to 90 degrees and using her hands to push some of the medium boxes forward and/or using her hip to push some of the big boxes.

> (c)     The plaintiff did not do the packing, unpacking and moving of the items in the agony of the moment. There was no great urgency to pack and/or move the items since the defendant had promptly cleared the water seepage and cleaned up the Premises. Alternatively, only the initial few days after the Incident could have been an agony of the moment situation. However, the packing, unpacking and moving occurred over the course of weeks, and the plaintiff had sufficient time to react to the situation and could have set a reasonable pace for packing, unpacking and moving the items, but she failed to do so.

> (d)     In the premises, it was the plaintiff’s own choice to pack, unpack and move the items by herself without any assistance, and the manner in which she performed these tasks, which caused her injuries.

17     With respect, I am unable to accept this submission.

#### The plaintiff’s failure to request for assistance to pack and move the items

18     In my judgment, it was reasonable for the plaintiff to assume that she could manage the packing, unpacking and moving of the items in the premises in the aftermath of the Incident. As mentioned at \[12\] to \[13\] above, the plaintiff’s cervical spondylosis was asymptomatic for more than eight years from 2010 until late April 2018, such that she could manage her move into the Premises by herself in 2014 and serve actively in church as a server/usher between December 2014 and the date of the Incident. Moreover, the small, the medium and the Toyogo boxes which the plaintiff had carried herself in the aftermath of the Incident were not particularly heavy. Each small box weighed about 1 to 2 kg, each medium size box about 2 to 4 kg, and each Toyogo box was about 5 to 7 kg.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) There is nothing to suggest that at the material time, the plaintiff knew she could not manage these boxes by herself. In fact, the evidence shows the contrary: it is the plaintiff’s unchallenged evidence that she had carried, among other things, the Toyogo boxes herself, without any issue, when she first moved into the Premises.[^18]

19     It was also reasonable for the plaintiff to proceed on the basis that neither the defendant, her family, her church mates nor HDB would not be able to assist her in unpacking, packing and moving the items in the Premises. I arrive at this view for the following reasons.

20      _First_, it is undisputed that the defendant did not offer any assistance to the plaintiff to pack, unpack and move the items in the Premises. The defendant’s project manager, Mr Isaac Lim, had simply told the plaintiff that they would send workers to the Premises to solve the water seepage issue, to assist the plaintiff to dispose the damaged items and furniture in the Premises and to do general cleaning and drying of the Premises. The workers were sent to the Premises for only on two days on 20 and 21 March 2018. Thereafter, the workers were not present at the Premises, except on one occasion on or about 15 or 16 April 2018 when the plaintiff requested the defendant to send a worker because she was feeling under the weather by then and could not move several boxes on her own.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

21     It is also undisputed that during the period that the plaintiff was unpacking, packing and moving the items in the Premises, the defendant was busy with ongoing HIP works for other units in the housing estate that the plaintiff was living in.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

22     In the premises, it was reasonable for the plaintiff to assume that by and large, the defendant would not be able to assist her in packing, unpacking and moving her items.

23      _Second_, it is the evidence of Ms Wong Wei Lai (“Ms Wong”) – the defendant’s sole witness and Deputy Head (Contracts) – that the defendant had a standard protocol under which, in flooding incidents, they would inform the homeowner that (a) they could assist to move his items and furniture around so as to clean up the premises and place the items and furniture back in their original positions, but (b) they could not assist to pack and unpack his items. Ms Wong explained that the reason for this prohibition was to avoid creating additional issues, such as allegations of theft in the event its workers rendered such assistance and the homeowner’s items subsequently went missing.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) Ms Wong also confirmed that if the plaintiff had to do the packing and unpacking of items herself, she would expect the plaintiff to carry the items herself.[^22]

24     In the premises, I am not satisfied that even if the plaintiff had requested the defendant for assistance in packing and unpacking the items and more extensive assistance in moving the items, the defendant would have rendered such assistance. My view is reinforced by the fact that Ms Wong did not assert, anywhere in her evidence, that the defendant would have obliged the plaintiff if she had requested their assistance to pack and unpack her items or that they bear the cost of her engagement of a helper/mover.

25      _Finally_, it is the plaintiff’s unchallenged evidence that she was living alone, did not have strong family support to turn to, and had always done things by herself. If at all, she only has a sister, but her sister lives quite far away from her and has her own family to take care of.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) Moreover, it was not put to the plaintiff, nor is there any evidence to suggest, that her church mates or HDB would have assisted her in packing, unpacking and moving the items in the Premises if she had asked them for such help. In the premises, it has not been proven that the plaintiff could have obtained assistance from her family, her church mates or HDB to pack, unpack and move the items in the Premises.

26     For completeness, I would add that even if one assumes that the plaintiff had carelessly overestimated her ability to pack, unpack and move the items in the Premises by herself, that would simply be an error of judgment, made in the face of the distressing situation created by the Incident which required her to promptly pack, unpack and move her items in the course of a month. Such an error of judgment should not count against the plaintiff.

#### The manner in which the plaintiff packed and moved the items

27     Turning to the manner in which the plaintiff had packed, unpacked and moved the items in the Premises, I do not think that she had performed these tasks in an unsafe manner.

28     I first address the pace at which the plaintiff had packed, unpacked and moved the items in the Premises. As seen in the chronology prepared by the plaintiff in exhibits P4 and P5, she had packed, unpacked and moved the items over the course of about a month from 20 March 2018 to 25 April 2018, and for most days during this one-month period, she had spent a substantial part of the day packing, unpacking and/or moving. However, I do not think such a pace is unreasonable, considering:[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

> (a)     the vast number of items in the plaintiff’s home;

> (b)     that many of these items and the plaintiff’s furniture were substantially damaged by the flooding;

> (c)     that the damaged items had been left untouched for about 12 hours from 19 March 2018 before 8pm until 20 March 2018 10.30am, and might emit a stench if the plaintiff did not promptly pack and separate the damaged items from those which were still in usable condition;

> (d)     that after the Incident, the plaintiff had (at the defendant’s request) ordered replacement furniture which was delivered on 28 March 2018 and 16 April 2018, i.e. about one week and three weeks respectively after the Incident. In preparation for the arrival of the replacement furniture, the relevant items in the Premises had to be packed, and the relevant areas where the new furniture would be placed had to be cleaned;

> (e)     that given the space constraints in the Premises, in the course of the packing, unpacking and moving, the plaintiff had to move and/or push some boxes around from room to room as part of space planning; and

> (f)     that the plaintiff’s cervical spondylosis had not given her any problems for the eight years prior to the Incident.

29     I move on to the manner in which the plaintiff moved the boxes on her own. I am not satisfied that the plaintiff’s act of carrying boxes weighing up to 7 kg by herself, bending down close to 90 degrees and using her hands to push some of the medium boxes, and using her hip to push some of the big boxes, was unsafe. This is for two reasons.

30      _First_, the plaintiff’s cervical spondylosis did not give her any problems for the past eight years before the Incident. In fact, she moved into the Premises in 2014 by herself without any issues, and in that process, she had carried the Toyogo boxes herself: see \[18\] above.

31      _Second_, the defendant has not adduced any objective evidence of what constitutes safe and unsafe methods of moving such boxes, so as to substantiate its assertion that the plaintiff’s manner of moving the boxes was unsafe.

##    Issue 2: Were the plaintiff’s injuries foreseeable and not too remote

32     The defendant submits that the plaintiff’s injury commenced more than a month after the flooding incident and was therefore too remote / not reasonably foreseeable.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

33     I am unable to accept this submission for two reasons.

34      _First_, the doctrine of remoteness is concerned with whether the _type_ of damage caused by the defendant’s negligence is reasonably foreseeable, as opposed to whether the _precise extent_ of the damage is reasonably foreseeable: see Gary Chan, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2016) at \[7.094\]. The type of damage at hand is personal injuries. In my view, it is reasonably foreseeable that in the aftermath of the Incident which substantially damaged the items in the Premises, the plaintiff might sustain personal injuries, for example, fall sick (which she did) under the stress of having to pack, unpack and move many items promptly over the course of a month.

35      _Second_, and in any event, it is Dr Lor’s unchallenged evidence that the delayed surfacing of the plaintiff’s injuries could be accounted for on the basis that the repetitive actions involved in her packing, unpacking and moving of items over the course of a month ultimately triggered the sensitivity in her nerves and caused a sudden severe flare up of pain.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) Hence, I find that the mere fact that the plaintiff’s injury surfaced slightly more than a month after the Incident does not render it too remote to the Incident.

## Issue 3: The quantum of damages the plaintiff is entitled to

36     For the forgoing reasons, I find that the defences of contributorily negligence, _novus actus interveniens_ and remoteness of loss have not been made out. The defendant is therefore wholly liable to the plaintiff for the aggravation of her pre-existing cervical spondylosis.

37     I now consider the proper quantification of the plaintiff’s losses.

38     The defendant admits to all of the plaintiff’s claims for special damages, namely replacement cost of $3,650.80 for her damaged items, pre-trial medical expenses of $5,250.95 and pre-trial transport expenses of $285.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) Thus, I award these sums to the plaintiff.

39     It is the plaintiff’s claims for general damages which are disputed by the defendant. The parties’ positions on these heads of claim are summarised below:

### Pain and suffering

40     It is apposite to begin my analysis on this head of claim by setting out the extent of the plaintiff’s injuries:

> (a)     The unchallenged medical evidence is that the plaintiff’s packing, unpacking and moving of items in the Premises after the Incident had aggravated her pre-existing cervical spondylosis, although the extent of aggravation is impossible to quantify.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

> (b)     In particular, the plaintiff was diagnosed to have cervical radiculopathy secondary to multiple level cervical degenerative disc disease, wherein central canal stenosis is worst at C4-5 and there are varying degrees of neural foraminal stenosis most severe at C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7 with impingement of the exiting C5, C6 and C7 nerve roots bilaterally.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

> (c)     The following are the symptoms and/or disabilities arising from the plaintiff’s aforesaid injury from late April 2018 to-date:

>> (i)       On 29 April 2018, the plaintiff was noted to have excruciating shoulder pain and hand numbness, to the extent that she needed to call the SCDF for an ambulance to ferry her to KTPH. Her pain score was noted to be 10/10 on arrival.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

>> (ii)       On 18 May 2018, the plaintiff reported persistent right neck and arm pain, with the pain radiating from her neck to her right shoulder and right hand, with occasional tingling over the fingers of her right hand. Physical examination revealed central tenderness over the cervical spine associated with right paravertebral muscle tenderness, Spurling’s sign positive[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) on the right, decreased motor power MRC grade 4[^32] over the right C6 and C7 myotomes, decreased sensation grade 1[^33] over the right C6, C7 and C8 dermatomes and decreased strength in her right upper limb.[^34]

>> (iii)       On 24 May 2018, the plaintiff complained of pain from right shoulder to forearm, with numbness and pins and needles over her middle three fingers. On examination, she was found to have fairly good neck range with mild neck soreness and no neurological deficit. However, there was tightness of her neck muscles with pain over her neck joints, and increased neutral sensitisation.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

>> (iv)       On 5 July 2018, the plaintiff was observed to have decreased motor power MRC grade 3 to 4 of her right hand.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

>> (v)       On 27 August 2018, the plaintiff complained of pain over her right shoulder, right elbow, right forearm, right coracoid and right scapular region. On examination, she was found to have full range of motion of her neck, but with pain on neck movement, tightness of her neck muscles and increased neural sensitisation, and reduced sensation and strength over her right upper limb.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) On 28 August 2018, the plaintiff reported improvement of approximately 90% in the pain she experienced with non-operative management (such as physiotherapy), but there was still significant pain and disability.[^38]

>> (vi)       At trial, Ms Hazel Ting Xu Teng (“Ms Ting”), a physiotherapist at KTPH, testified that after all the physiotherapy sessions the plaintiff underwent at KTPH, her pain improved, her neck range of motion was better in the sense that she could move with less pain, her muscle strength improved, and her exercise tolerance improved. However, the plaintiff still experienced some reduced tolerance in that she still could not carry heavy loads. That said, the plaintiff was considered well enough to be discharged from physiotherapy on 26 February 2022 by Ms Ting’s colleague.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

>> (vii)       Notwithstanding her discharge from physiotherapy, it is the plaintiff’s unchallenged evidence in \[76\] to \[79\] of her AEIC that to-date, her injury still causes her random spurts of pain and/or stiffness, functional limitations as she now has to use her non-dominant left hand for certain day-to-day activities (such as brushing her teeth, carrying her handbag, bathing, doing laundry and cooking), and difficulty sleeping. I accept the plaintiff’s evidence, as it is consistent with Dr Lor’s opinion that he commonly encounters such complaints from patients with similar conditions as the plaintiff.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

> (d)     As of 14 July 2020, Dr Lor opined that the permanent disability to the plaintiff’s right shoulder, right forearm, right hand and fingers of her right hand is 20%.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) However, he found it difficult to quantify how much of the 20% was attributable to her pre-existing cervical spondylosis as opposed to the aggravation of that condition, as the two are closely linked.[^42]

> (e)     At trial, Dr Lor testified that his current prognosis was that the pain the plaintiff experiences as a result of her condition is likely to be a chronic on-and-off problem because the abnormalities are permanent. In this regard, there could be flares in her symptoms depending on her daily activities (such as her movements) and mental state, but there could also be periods of ‘quietence’ where the symptoms are not observed.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43)

41     The parties agree that the recommended range of damages for back injuries of moderate severity under category (b)(ii) of p. 23 of the Guidelines for Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“the 2010 Guidelines”) is relevant.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) These guidelines suggest a range from $10,000 to $17,000. The parties’ dispute lies in the quantum of damages to be awarded.

42     In my judgment, based on the extent of the plaintiff’s injury and the symptoms and disabilities arising therefrom, the appropriate starting point for the award of general damages for pain and suffering is $14,000, i.e. around the midpoint of the range set out in the 2010 Guidelines. I arrive at this view for the following reasons:

> (a)     In the 2012 unreported decision of _Geok Leng v Chng Beng Seng_, $12,000 was awarded as general damages for pain and suffering for the exacerbation of pre-existing cervical spondylosis, causing pain in the neck radiating to the shoulder and decreased range of motion of the neck, which was treated conservatively with medication, physiotherapy and acupuncture: see Practitioners’ Library, Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents, 3rd ed. (LexisNexis Singapore, 2017) (“Practitioner’s Library: Assessment of Damages”) at p. 662. By contrast, in the present case, the plaintiff had experienced and, to some degree, is still experiencing the _additional_ disability of numbness, diminished sensation and diminished strength in her upper right limb (including her right hand). Thus, the general damages for her pain and suffering should be more than $12,000.

> (b)     The cases cited by the plaintiff which involve awards of $15,000 or more for pain and suffering can be distinguished. The symptoms in those cases were more severe, and/or the extent of aggravation was found to be relatively significant as contrasted to the present case where the extent of aggravation is impossible to quantify:

>> (i)       In _Ng Lay Peng v Gain City Engineering & Consultancy Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 184</span> (where the award was $23,000), the Court had found that the extent of aggravation of the plaintiff’s pre-existing cervical and lumbar spondylosis was 35%, that the aggravation was part of the cause of cauda equina syndrome (a serious condition where nerves at the end of the spinal cord are compressed and if not properly treated, can lead to paralysis of the legs), and that the plaintiff had to use a crutch to aid her in walking because of the pain and weakness in her left leg radiating from her lower spine.[^45]

>> (ii)       In _Lau Pang Cheng David v Tan Boon Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 223</span> (where the award was $20,000), the medical evidence was that the accident severely exacerbated the plaintiff’s pre-existing degenerative cervical spine condition.[^46]

>> (iii)       In _Kaneda Mikio & Ors v Singapore Bus Service Ltd_ (Suit No. 409 of 2002) (where the award was $15,000), the aggravation of the plaintiff’s pre-existing cervical spondylosis caused him to suffer not only pain radiating down the left upper limb with associated weakness and intermittent numbness of the fingers of his left hand, but also chronic neck pain with flare up of very acute pain from time to time which necessitated injections for pain relief, intensive physiotherapy, bed rest and medical leave.[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47)

> Therefore, in the present case, prior to taking into account inflation, the general damages for the plaintiff’s pain and suffering should not exceed $15,000.

> (c)      _Karuppiah Nirmala v Singapore Bus Services Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 99</span> appears to be the most analogous to the present case. A car accident in that case aggravated the plaintiff’s pre-existing cervical spondylosis. Within a few days after the accident, the plaintiff experienced acute pain in her cervical spine and right sided radiculopathy down to her upper right extremity (including her shoulders), and examination showed tenderness, restriction of rotation and minimum muscle spasm in her cervical spine and diminished sensation in her right palm. By a year later, the plaintiff had recovered from the acute pain from her cervical spine injury. However, she still suffered from neck ache with associated numbness of the right arm on and off. The medical experts were of the view that the plaintiff would experience chronic neck ache and episode radiculopathy. There was no indication in the judgment that the plaintiff’s pre-existing cervical spondylosis was symptomatic prior to the accident.[^48] $14,000 was awarded for her pain and suffering.

43     Taking $14,000 as my starting point, I then apply:

> (a)     a discount in view of the impossibility of quantifying the extent of aggravation in this case. The discount is not an extensive one, as I bear in mind that the plaintiff’s cervical spondylosis was asymptomatic for eight years prior to the Incident,

> (b)     followed by an uplift for inflation, bearing in mind that the award in _Karuppiah_ was made about 20 years ago,

> to arrive at an award of $16,000 as general damages for pain and suffering for the plaintiff in this case.

### Loss of earning capacity

44     The plaintiff submits that she is entitled to an award for loss of earning capacity as she is at a real or substantial risk of losing her current job as a babysitter.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) With respect, I am unable to agree with this submission.

45     I accept that the plaintiff’s injury is still causing her random spurts of pain and/or stiffness and functional limitations (see \[40(c)(vii)\] above), which in turn hampers her ability to use her right arm to carry loads such as new-born babies.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) However, I am not satisfied that this disability puts the plaintiff at a real or substantial risk of losing her current job, given that she has been able to take on babysitting jobs since October 2018 in spite of this disability.[^51]

46     Furthermore, the plaintiff’s concern that her condition might worsen over time to the extent that she has to stop babysitting completely is not corroborated by her medical experts. On the contrary, the medical evidence is that from the time her cervical spondylosis became symptomatic again in April 2018 to the date of the trial, the plaintiff experienced significant improvement in her pain and symptoms after conservative treatment, and has been discharged from physiotherapy earlier in February this year.

47     Although there is some dispute on the circumstances leading to the plaintiff’s discharge from physiotherapy, the very fact of the discharge, coupled with the fact that she did not seek further physiotherapy in the nine weeks between the discharge and the trial, strongly suggests that her condition was one which by and large, she would be able to manage herself without the need for regular future physiotherapy. Moreover, while Dr Lor gave evidence that the plaintiff’s cervical spondylosis was a chronic problem for which she could sometimes experience flares in her symptoms, he did not go as far as to say that her symptoms would likely worsen to the point that she would not be able to continue her current babysitting job.

48     For these reasons, I decline to award the plaintiff any damages for loss of earning capacity.

### Future medical expenses

49     As laid down in \[4.50\] of Practitioner’s Library: Assessment of Damages, the Courts must generally be satisfied that future medical expenses will be incurred before granting them. Hence, the Courts will generally require proof that such treatments are indeed necessary in the future.

50     The plaintiff submits that she is entitled to $5,000 for future medical expenses for regular physiotherapy sessions and up to three nerve root injections.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) The plaintiff relies on the following matters in support of this submission:[^53]

> (a)     Her discharge from physiotherapy was not because she had fully recovered but because she was told by the physiotherapist that the physiotherapy sessions could not last forever as she had been undergoing physiotherapy for a very long time. She intends to get a referral letter to continue physiotherapy, as she still suffers from pain in her right forearm.

> (b)     Dr Lor had given evidence that the plaintiff’s condition was likely to be chronic.

> (c)     Dr Liu had given evidence that the plaintiff’s current job of babysitting is something that could trigger her pain:

51     In my judgment, the plaintiff has not proven the necessity for her to undergo regular physiotherapy and up to three nerve root injections.

52     While the plaintiff’s condition is chronic, that fact in itself does not mean regular physiotherapy since chronic pain can, in some cases, be managed by the patient without resort to treatment on a regular basis. In this regard, the plaintiff’s physiotherapist at KTPH had deemed it fit to discharge her from physiotherapy. As mentioned at \[47\] above, the discharge and the fact that the plaintiff did not seek further physiotherapy as at the date of the trial strongly suggests that her condition was one which she could largely manage by herself without the need for regular future physiotherapy.

53     Moreover, Ms Ting had made it clear that even if the plaintiff sees a doctor with the view of getting a referral to continue physiotherapy, the doctor will only make the referral if he deems it necessary.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) There is no such referral letter before me stating that at present, the plaintiff still requires regular physiotherapy for her injury. I give little weight to Dr Lor’s opinion that the plaintiff is estimated to require four to six physiotherapy sessions per year since that opinion was issued more than 18 months before the plaintiff’s physiotherapist had deemed it fit to discharge her from physiotherapy.

54     Turning to the nerve root injections, Dr Lor had opined that these are necessary only if the patient’s symptoms are very severe and persistent.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55) Based on the evidence set out at \[40\] above, I do not think the plaintiff’s symptoms are currently, or in the future likely to be, at the level of severity that would require nerve root injections.

55     That being said, in light of the chronic nature of the plaintiff’s condition, it is reasonable to expect that she would have to incur the cost of follow-up consultations on her condition and that _on occasion_, she may experience a flare up of her pain and symptoms for which she would require medication and/or physiotherapy: see \[40(e)\] above. On the basis that the average life expectancy of a female in Singapore who is 65 years old (as of 2021) is around 88 years old,[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) and that the plaintiff is currently 57 years old, I find that a conservative estimate of the cost of such treatment is $1,500. This sum is roughly equivalent to the cost of about 15 physiotherapy sessions[^57] and consultation sessions over the plaintiff’s remaining lifespan of about 30 years. I therefore award the plaintiff $1,500 as damages for future medical expenses.

### Future transport expenses

56     The plaintiff submits that once her claim for future medical expenses is made out, she should be entitled to a nominal amount of $500 for future transport expenses.

57     I am unable to agree with this submission. The plaintiff presently does not have any mobility issues and there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that she is likely to have mobility issues in the future. Moreover, to the extent that she requires follow-up consultations, medication and/or physiotherapy, KTPH (at which she has been seeking treatment over the past few years) is a short bus ride from her home. In the premises, her claim for future transport expenses of $500 is excessive. I award her a nominal sum of $50 for the cost of taking public transport to attend future medical appointments.

## Conclusion

58     While I do have sympathy for the plaintiff’s plight, certain heads of her claims were not borne out by the evidence. I accordingly had to dismiss those heads of claim or reduce the amount of damages awarded thereunder.

59     In conclusion, I enter final judgment for the plaintiff for the following sums: general damages in the sum of $17,550, interest on these general damages at 5.33% p.a. from the date of the Writ to the date of this judgment, special damages in the sum of $9,458.23 and interest on these special damages at 2.67% p.a. from the date of the Incident to the date of this judgment.

60     I will decide on the incidence and quantum of costs if it cannot be agreed between the parties.

[^31]: Dr Lor had explained that the Spurling test is a provocative test where you turn the neck in a certain way which narrows the neuroforamina (i.e. the openings in the spine where the nerves to the limbs come out). The narrowing of these openings will create pain if the nerves are being pinched or compressed: see NE, 10 May 2022, 10/20-27.

[^32]: Dr Lor had explained that MRC is an increasing scale from 0 to 5 for grading muscle power, whereby 0 means there is no muscle power at all and 5 means there is full muscle power. A grading of 4 means that there is muscle power but it is not full: see NE, 10 May 2022, 29/13-30/19

[^33]: Dr Lor had explained that this is a similar grading system as MRC, but the scale is from 0 to 2. 0 means there is no sensation. 1 means there is some sensation, but it is not normal. 2 means there is normal sensation: see NE, 10 May 2022, 30/20-31/1.
