Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Possession of obscene films

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9688/2020/01.\]

23 July 2020

### Senior District Judge Bala Reddy:

1       The Accused, Michael Frank Hartung, a 49-year-old male, pleaded guilty to two charges under s 30(1) Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed) (“Films Act”). The two charges are reproduced below:

> DAC-906129-2017

> “You…Michael Frank Hartung…are charged that you, on the 30th day of August 2016 at about 9.00 am, at No 11 Simei Street 4 #XXX ‘Simei Green Condominium’, Singapore, did have in your possession 225 Digital video compact discs containing 225 films which are obscene, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed).”

> DAC-906130-2017

> “You…Michael Frank Hartung…are charged that you on the 30th day of August 2016, at about 9.00 am, at No 11 Simei Street 4 #XXX ‘Simei Green Condominium’, Singapore, did have in your possession one Samsung Galaxy mega white colour hand phone, one Samsung Galaxy Tab, one Samsung Note 4, and one Lenovo laptop (s/no. L3APT5K0812) containing 20 films which are obscene, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed).”

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly. Two other charges under s 21(1)(a) Films Act were consented by the Accused to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After hearing the sentencing submissions by both parties, I sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment. This sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment was ordered to commence at the end of an imprisonment term of 66 months’ which the Accused is presently serving sentence following his conviction after trial of two offences under s 376D(1)(c) Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”).

4       The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence, has filed an appeal against the sentence I imposed. I set out the grounds of my decision below.

> 6.    All 225 obscene films found in the 225 DVDs were between an hour and 5 hours in length.

> 7.    Of the 225 obscene films in the 225 DVDs, seven (7) films were found to contain child abuse material (also previously known as child pornography). The seven films portray naked and half-naked young and pre-pubescent boys and girls below 16 years of age engaged in sexual poses and sexual activities with other young and prepubescent children, as well as adult men and women.

> 8.    Particularly, the sexual acts exhibited in the said seven films include acts of penile-oral/penile-anal/penile-vaginal intercourse by children with adults, penetrative and non-penetrative sexual acts, Bondage, Deviant, Sado-Masochism (BDSM) acts, sex with multiple child partners, sex with ejaculation onto children’s faces, genitalia and bodies, and the use of sex toys and instruments on the said children, amongst others. The obscene films also show close-up images of the genitals, anus and breasts (for young and pre-pubescent girls) of the pre-pubescent children while playing, dancing, lying down and while the child is being sexually abused.

> 9.    The evidence revealed that some of the young girls could be as young as 5 years old, with a majority of the films featuring children who are pre-pubescent, taking into consideration the filenames of the films as well as the appearance of the young girls.

> 10.    The title of each of the seven (7) DVDs and a brief summary of the child abuse material found in each of the said DVDs are set out as follows:

>> a.    AKARI (the “1st DVD”): A 4-hour 4-minute 39-second-long obscene film. 3 hours 37 seconds of the said film comprised of at least four distinct video clips of multiple half-naked and naked pre-pubescent girls, young girls and young boys below the age of 16 years performing various sexual acts with adult men and other children. One of the four said video clips was titled “真美14歲” in the Chinese language, which when translated into the English language means “really beautiful 14 years old”;

>> b.    An unmarked disc (the “2nd DVD”): A 36-minute 41-second-long obscene film comprised of at least seven distinct video clips of multiple half-naked and naked pre-pubescent girls, young girls and young boys below the age of 16 years performing various sexual acts with adult men and other pre-pubescent children;

>> c.    ‘6A BKYG 01’ (the “3rd DVD”): A 56-minute 57-second-long obscene film comprising at least three distinct video clips of three half-naked and naked prepubescent girls below the age of 16 years performing various sexual acts with adult men;

>> d.    “Age 12 Fuck Age 12 (Cou)ples Seduce Teens Daught” (the “4th DVD”): A 4- hour 25-minute-long obscene film comprising at least 14 distinct video clips of half-naked and naked pre-pubescent girls, young girls and young boys below the age of 16 years performing various sexual acts with other children and adult men and women;

>> e.    “EUROIO #5” (the “5th DVD”): A 1-hour 3-minute long obscene film comprising at least 18 videos of half-naked and naked pre-pubescent girls, young girls and young boys below the age of 16 years performing various sexual acts with other children and adult men;

>> f.    “小孩子10 岁” (in the Chinese language, which means ‘small children 10 years old’ in the English language) (the “6th DVD”): A 1-hour 17-minute long obscene film. 55 minutes of the said film comprised of at least three videos of half-naked and naked pre-pubescent, teenage girls, young girls and young boys below the age of 16 years performing various sexual acts with other children and adult men; and

>> g.    “小孩子10 岁” (in the Chinese language, which means ‘small children 10 years old’ in the English language’) (the “7th DVD”): A 1-hour 9-minute-long video comprising at least four videos of half-naked and naked pre-pubescent boys and girls below the age of 16 years performing various sexual acts with other children and adult men.

> 11.    The images printed on each of the seven DVDs, screenshots of several acts depicted in each DVD and the list of sexual acts performed by pre-pubescent children below the age of 16 years on adult men, women and other children are annexed in Annex A of the Statement of Facts.

> 12.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under section 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed) (the “Films Act”).

> Facts pertaining to the 4th Charge under s 30(1) Films Act (DAC-906130-2017)

> 13.    Twenty-three (23) films from the exhibits marked “MFH6”, “MFH8”, MFH13” and “4G” were submitted to the Board for checking. Of the 23 films submitted, 20 video files were found to contain 20 films which were classified to be obscene as they contained one or more of the following scenes as stated at \[4(a)\] to \[4(h)\] in this Statement of Facts.

> 14.    Further, of the 20 obscene films in the Accused’s possession, three (3) films were found to contain child abuse material. The films featured adult men performing sexual acts on pre-pubescent girls, and include content listed at \[7\] and \[8\] of this Statement of Facts above.

> 15.    The evidence revealed that some of the young girls could be as young as 4 years old, based on the filenames of the films as well as the appearance of the young girls. The three obscene films containing child abuse material feature the following acts:

>> a.    An obscene film titled “\_michelle\_4yo\_\[121473\]”: A 1-minute 39-secondlong video of a pre-pubescent girl performing fellatio on an adult man without a condom, and engaging in penile-vaginal intercourse with him without a condom;

>> b.    An obscene film titled “005facial”: A 23-second-long video of a man manually masturbating himself in a pre-pubescent girl’s face and ejaculating onto her face, including her nostrils, her eyes and lips while gripping the girl’s head with his hand.

>> c.    An obscene film titled “Very Young Asian Girl Gets Fucked”: A 36-secondlong video of a pre-pubescent girl masturbating an adult man with her hand and posing for a photograph at the same time by looking at a nearby off-screen camera and waving the “V” sign with her right index and middle fingers.

> 16.    Screenshots of these three obscene films are also found at pages 21 and 22 of Annex A of this SOF.

> 17.    In view of the foregoing, the Accused has committed the offence of possession of obscene films under s 30(1) of the Films Act.

> Conclusion

> 18.    Further evidence found on the devices belonging to the accused revealed other child abuse material depicting pre-pubescent girls engaged in sexual poses and sexual acts with adult men. These pictures are annexed to this Statement of Facts at Annex B.

> 19.    The accused admits to the two proceeded charges respectively.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

6       Learned DPP Andre Ong for the prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold had been crossed in the present case, and that a global sentence of at least 15 weeks’ imprisonment should be imposed. The following offence-specific aggravating factors were highlighted:[^1]

> (a)     The large number of obscene films (245 films for both charges in total);

> (b)     The significant degree of morally depraved acts inflicted in the obscene films (10 out of the 245 obscene films involve the sexual exploitation of children);

> (c)     The length of the obscene films (the obscene films last between 36 seconds to 4 hours and 25 minutes); and

> (d)     The age of the child victims (the children exploited in the films were as young as 4 years old to 16 years old).

7       Specifically, the obscene films contained child abuse material depicting adult men, women and children engaging in deplorable and highly depraved sexual acts and crimes against nature with other children of both genders. These sexual acts involved bondage, ejaculation, and penetration of the children’s oral and anal cavities with penises and other sex toys and instruments.[^2]

8       In order to deter like-minded offenders, the learned DPP submitted that at least 15 weeks’ imprisonment should be imposed for DAC-906129-2017 considering the lengthier and more depraved nature of the obscene films involving children, and a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment be imposed for DAC-906130-2017 considering the shorter and relatively less depraved nature of the obscene films also involving children.[^3] Both of these sentences should run concurrently, as the offences were committed close together in time.

9       The learned DPP further submitted that the proposed global sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment run consecutively with the 66-month imprisonment sentence which the Accused is currently serving for his offences committed under s 376D(1)(c) Penal Code. The learned DPP argued that the present offences committed under the Films Act are unrelated to those committed under s 376D (1) (c) Penal Code, as they were committed at different transactions. Moreover, both sets of offences contravene different legally protected interests. The proposed sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment does not infringe the totality principle and would not be crushing on the Accused.[^4]

## Mitigation

10     In his Mitigation Plea, Mr Si, for the Defence stated that the Accused had lost his lucrative job because of his arrest, and had not been able to secure any gainful employment since his arrest.[^5] His wife and daughter have also suffered as a result as the Accused’s savings are insufficient to sustain them in Singapore.[^6] During the course of the proceedings, his mother passed away. Mr Si also referred to a character reference from the Accused’s pastor.[^7]

11     Mr Si, further highlighted that the DVDs originated from Germany and had been inadvertently shipped from Germany to Singapore.[^8] Mr Si also honed in on the fact that out of all the obscene films found in the Accused’s possession, only a small percentage contained child abuse material.[^9] The DVDs were not of active interest or distributed to any party and were largely unopened in their original packaging.[^10]

## Court’s Decision

12     The dominant sentencing principle for an offence of possession of obscene films, particularly films containing child pornography, should be one of general and specific deterrence. A firm and uncompromising stance should be adopted against possession of obscene films to reflect the society’s condemnation of material, which degrade our sense of decency and infringe on society’s ideals of human condition.

13     The type and quantum of the sentence would depend on the circumstances, including the nature, quality and quantity of the obscene films. The issue of whether there is any commercial gain is also considered. A non-custodial sentence is reserved for isolated offences where the number of films is small, where they are for personal use and without any commercial element, and the accused is a first-time offender who had pleaded guilty: _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Edition, 2013) at pp 627 – 628. On the facts, based on the sheer quantity of the obscene films seized, there was no doubt that the custodial threshold had been crossed.

14     I now move on to examine the relevant sentencing precedents. A helpful starting point can be found in the case of _PP v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 222</span>. In _Chong Hou En_, the offender pleaded guilty to five counts of insulting the modesty of a woman by intruding upon her privacy under s 509 Penal Code and one charge under s 30(1) Films Act. In relation to the charge under s 30(1) Films Act, he was found to be in possession of 10,574 obscene video films across his electronic devices. The footages contained videos of females showering in his girlfriend’s parents’ home, including his girlfriend’s older sister (aged 30), his girlfriend’s sister-in-law (aged 31) and his girlfriend’s two younger nieces (aged 10 and 12). The obscene videos captured the victims fully nude. Chan Seng Onn J sentenced the offender to four weeks’ imprisonment. He gave the offender the benefit of doubt that the films were short video clips and considered the offender’s plea of guilt and the extent of remorse he has shown (at \[86\]). Chan J further opined that if the offender had not pleaded guilty and shown the degree of remorse he did, a stiffer custodial sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment would have been meted out.

15     Another relevant case to note would be _PP v Tan Hiap Hua_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 322</span> which was also cited within _Chong Hou En_. In _Tan Hiap Hua_, the offender pleaded guilty to a single charge of possession of 38 obscene films under s 30(1) Films Act. Apart from the fact that the obscene films were found in the offender’s hand phone, the statement of facts did not provide any details regarding the nature of obscenity of the said films. The district judge sentenced the offender to three months’ imprisonment. The district judge took into account the long list of antecedents of the offender, including offences of possession of obscene films for which he was previously sentenced to five years of corrective training. On appeal, V K Rajah JA, reduced the sentence to six weeks’ imprisonment. No written grounds were issued.

16     In the present case, it should be noted that the 245 obscene films found in the Accused’s possession were in no small quantity. In contrast to the presumably short video clips in _Chong Hou En_, the child abuse materials found in the Accused’s possession contained films which were much longer, one of which lasted for about four hours. Based on the SOF, within the seven films from the DVDs containing child abuse material, there were multiple video clips of naked and half-naked pre-pubescent young girls and boys engaging in highly provocative and depraved sexual activities with each other or with adult men. The degree of obscenity and level of sexual exploitation in the present case were also significantly more egregious and deplorable, especially considering the young age of the children involved. None of the victims in the _Chong Hou En_ case were made to engage in sexual poses or to perform any penetrative sexual acts. Whereas in the present case, the children depicted in the obscene films were exploited to carry out devious, and disgusting acts in the production of child pornography. In _Tan Hiap Hua_, a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment was imposed by the High Court even though the 38 obscene films contained no child pornography or child abuse material at all. Accordingly, there ought to be a significant uplift from the four to six weeks’ imprisonment imposed in _Chong Hou En_ and _Tan Hiap Hua_.

17     The learned DPP also cited the following unreported decisions involving s 30(1) Films Act in his sentencing submissions:[^11]

> (a)     In _PP v Loh Wei Siong_ SC-900891-2018 (unreported), the offender pleaded guilty to 10 charges under s 509 Penal Code, one charge under s 341 Penal Code, and one charge under s 30(1) Films Act. He consented to having 28 other charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, most of which were offences under s 509 and s 447 Penal Code. In relation to the charge under s 30(1) Films Act, the offender was found to be in possession of 94 obscene films. The pornographic films were downloaded from the Internet and located in his “Lenovo” desktop computer. The offender was untraced. He was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment for the charge under s 30(1) Films Act.

> (b)     In _PP v Mohammed Faisal Bin Kemat_ SC-912901-2015 (unreported), the offender pleaded guilty to 15 charges under s 509 Penal Code, two charges under s 21(1)(a) Films Act and three charges under s 30(1) Films Act. In relation to the three proceeded s 30(1) Films Act charges, the offender was found with one obscene film in the offender’s Apple iPhone 5 mobile phone, 42 obscene films in the offender’s HTC One-X mobile phone, and 104 obscene films in the offender’s Apple iMac laptop computer. The obscene films were downloads from the internet for his personal viewing. The offender was untraced. He was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment for the charge in relation to the 104 obscene films found in his Apple iMac laptop.

> (c)     In _PP v Joshua Robinson_ SC-900800-2016 (unreported), the offender pleaded guilty to three charges under s 376A(1)(a) Penal Code, four charges under s 29(1)(a) Films Act, one charge under s 293 Penal Code and one charge under s 30(1) Films Act. He consented to 20 other charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, including two charges under s 30(1) Films Act. In relation to the proceeded s 30(1) Films Act charge, the offender was found to be in possession of 5922 obscene films (6225 obscene films in total). Amongst the films in the offender’s possession, there were 321 films of child pornography, featuring adult men and women performing sexual acts on children of both genders, and children of both genders being induced to perform sexual acts with each other. The children in the films range from two years old to 16 years old in age, with majority of the films featuring children who were pre-pubescent. He was sentenced to the maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment for the s 30(1) Films Act charge.

18     In analysing these unreported precedents, the Court recognises that sentencing decisions in previous cases have limited value if they are unreasoned and unreported. Nonetheless, the cases provide some guidance in terms of the indicative sentences to be imposed based on the nature and quantity of the obscene films in possession which are established sentencing factors for an offence under s 30(1) Films Act.

19     The case of _Joshua Robinson_ would represent the highest end of the spectrum in terms of the gravity of an offence under s 30(1) Films Act where the maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment was imposed. Overall, more than 6,000 obscene films uncovered, out of which more than 300 obscene films concerned child pornography material. The nature and degree of obscenity of these 300 odd films were comparable to those in the child abuse material from the DVDs in the present case. However, in terms of the magnitude and quantity of obscene films, there should be a downward adjustment from the maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment.

20     Regardless, the present case was clearly more serious than _Loh Wei Siong_ and _Mohammed Faisal Bin Kemat_, which did not involve child abuse material at all and involved fewer quantities of obscene film. Both cases also involved first time offenders who had download the pornographic material over the internet for their personal viewing. Here, the DVDs containing the child abuse material were shipped in from Germany. Accordingly, a substantial uplift in sentence from the four to six weeks’ imprisonment imposed in _Loh Wei Siong_ and _Mohammed Faisal Bin Kemat_ was warranted.

21     In terms of any other offender-specific sentencing factors, I considered that the Accused had pleaded guilty to the charges and thus gave due mitigating weight to his plea of guilt. In terms of the Accused’s personal circumstances, the hardship faced by the Accused and his family as a result of his own actions were not so exceptional that they should be taken into account for sentencing purposes. The Accused was also not a first-time offender in favour of whom the law ought to show leniency. Particularly, in view of the Accused’s conviction for his previous set of offences under s 376D(1)(c) Penal Code, a strict deterrent stance, both general and specific, should be taken in order to protect the public and society at large from moral corruption. Taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the submissions from both parties, I imposed the following sentences:

> (a)     DAC-906129-2017: 12 weeks’ imprisonment

> (b)     DAC-906130-2017: 4 weeks’ imprisonment

22     I ordered both of these sentences to run concurrently, giving a global sentence of **12 weeks’ imprisonment**. The overall sentence reflects the staggering quantity of obscene films that were found in the Accused’s possession, a sizeable number of which contained sexual content which are highly exploitative of young children and acutely provocative to the human sense of decency. Given that there were two other charges that were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment was fair and appropriate.

23     The final issue concerned whether, under s 322(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the 12 weeks’ imprisonment term should commence on the day the Accused was sentenced (i.e. 15 July 2020) or at the end of the sentence currently being served by the Accused for his s 376D(1)(c) Penal Code offences. In the High Court case of _PP v Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 527</span>, Chao Hick Tin JA laid down five useful legal principles to guide the exercise of judicial discretion under s 322(1) of the CPC:

> (a)     First, the discretion must undoubtedly be exercised judiciously (at \[25\]);

> (b)     Second, the court is not entitled to backdate the sentence of any offender who is an escaped convict or is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment (at \[26\]);

> (c)     Third, in deciding whether to order a subsequent term of imprisonment to run immediately or at the expiration of the earlier term of imprisonment, the court should have regard to whether the subsequent offence(s) arose in the “same transaction” as the earlier offence(s), and also the totality of the sentence to be served (at \[27\]);

> (d)     Fourth, the court ultimately has a primary duty to determine the appropriate sentence which would best ensure that the ends of justice are met. No single consideration can conclusively determine the proper sentence and, in seeking to arrive at the proper sentence, the court must balance many factors, sometimes rejecting some. One factor that the court should consider is whether the totality of the sentence served is proportionate to the inherent gravity of all the offences committed by the accused (at \[33\]); and

> (e)     Fifth, in contemplating the totality of the sentences imposed on the accused, the trial judge should consider this question: if all the offences had been before him, would he still have passed a sentence of similar length (at \[34\]).

24     Applying these principles to the present case, I found that as a matter of principle and policy, the sentence for the present offences under the Films Act should run consecutively to the sentence imposed for the prior offences under s 376D(1)(c) Penal Code. The following points were important considerations in the exercise of the court’s discretion under s 322(1) CPC:

> (a)     First, the present set of offences under the Films Act did not arise out of the same transaction as the Accused’s previous offences under s 376D(1)(c) Penal Code, and these were therefore unrelated offences. A multiple offender who has committed unrelated offences should generally be separately punished for each offence, and this is achieved by ordering that the sentences run consecutively.

> (b)     Second, both sets of offences are distinct in that they contravene different legally protected interests. I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that the legislative intent behind s 376D(1)(c) Penal Code is to protect minors in destination countries overseas from being sexually exploited, while the legislative intent behind s 30(1) Films Act is to curb the possession of objectionable material in Singapore.[^12] Therefore, each set of offences committed by the Accused should attract its own set of consequences.

> (c)     Third, even if the sentences for both sets of offences were to run consecutively, the aggregate sentence to be served by the Accused would not be crushing or disproportionate. The additional 12 weeks’ imprisonment to be served by the Accused is a fraction of the 66 months’ imprisonment term imposed for the s 376D(1)(c) Penal Code offences and necessary to reflect the gravity of the present set of offences as well as the overall criminality of the Accused.

25     Therefore, I ordered the 12 weeks’ imprisonment term to commence upon the expiry of the current sentence being served by the Accused in order to serve the ends of justice. This would obviate a scenario where the Accused would effectively evade punishment for his offences under the Films Act if I were to order that the commencement of the sentence run concurrent to the term of imprisonment he is currently serving.
