### District Judge Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       “Alexandra Central” is a mixed-use strata title development comprising of a shopping mall and a hotel. To assist with management of the development, the management corporation of the development, the Plaintiff, appointed the Defendant, a company specialised in providing strata management services, as its managing agent. Several months into the agency contract, the Plaintiff decided to terminate the contract and sue the Defendant for breaching its contractual duties. The action proceeded to trial before me. After hearing parties, I allowed the claims in part and ordered the Defendant to pay damages. The Defendant has filed an appeal against my decision in part. I now provide the written grounds of my decision.

## Background facts

2       The Defendant was the managing agent of the development, Alexandra Central, 321 Alexandra Road Singapore 159971 (the “Development”) from January 2018 to 18 March 2019.

> (a)     On or around 4 August 2017, the Plaintiff appointed Steadlink Asset Management Pte Ltd (“Steadlink”) as the managing agent pursuant to a contract dated 4 August 2017 (the “Steadlink Contract”). Steadlink Asset Management Pte Ltd underwent a merger and acquisition in December 2017 following which it transferred its business to the Defendant. The Plaintiff did not terminate Steadlink’s appointment following the transfer. As such, the Defendant took over Steadlink’s role as the managing agent of the Development from January 2018 onwards.

> (b)     The Plaintiff formally appointed the Defendant as the managing agent for a one-year period from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 pursuant to a contract dated 1 July 2018 (the “Contract”).

> (c)     Prior to the completion of the one-year term, the Plaintiff issued a notice of termination to the Defendant on 20 February 2019. The Contract was terminated at the expiry of the one-month notice with effect from 19 March 2019.

### Contractual duties

3       It was undisputed that the contractual terms under the Steadlink Contract and the Contract (collectively, the “Contracts”) are substantially similar. It was also undisputed that the Defendant undertook various duties under the Contracts. In brief, the Defendant undertook to:

> (a)     act honestly, competently and diligently;

> (b)     carry out its duties in accordance with the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap. 30C, 2008 Revised Ed.) (“BMSMA”);

> (c)     supervise contracts and ensure that they carry out their duties and responsibilities properly and in a timely manner;

> (d)     be familiar with the statutory provisions of the BMSMA so that it may provide good and sufficient guidance and assistance to the Plaintiff and its council in complying with the same; and

> (e)     receive and management payment of charges and to keep proper records and account for all monies collected.

I will examine each of these duties in greater detail below.

4       Following the termination of the Contract, the Plaintiff appointed Colliers International Consultancy & Valuation (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Colliers”) as the incoming managing agent. The Plaintiff, dissatisfied with the Defendant’s performance during its tenure, decided to commence legal action to recover damages. In this regard, the Plaintiff alleged the Defendant to have breached its contractual duties as follows.

### Alleged breach of duties

5       First, the Defendant failed to supervise the landscaping contractor, Oakland Landscaping Pte Ltd (“Oakland”) in their landscaping services. The landscaping of the Development was badly maintained and in a state of disrepair. There were numerous dead trees and plants and along the boundary, main entrance and frontage of the Development. There was also weed found at the frontage of the hotel and shopping mall. The vertical green wall of the Development had little or no maintenance soil. To restore the damage, the Plaintiff engaged a replacement landscaping contractor at a cost of $33,405.

6       Second, the Defendant wrongly advised the Plaintiff to install hoarding works at vacant units within the shopping mall and deduct the cost of such installations from the sinking fund on or around September 2018. The Defendant’s advice was premised on the Plaintiff being able to seek reimbursement of such expenses from the subsidiary proprietors of the units concerned. The premise turned out to be erroneous as the Plaintiff did not have the legal right to recover the cost of the hoarding works from the subsidiary proprietors. However, in reliance of the Defendant’s advice, the Plaintiff had engaged a sole proprietorship called “Build Archive 1” (“Build Archive”) to install the hoarding works at $67,000 and funded such works from the sinking fund.

7       Third, the Defendant wrongly advised the Plaintiff to install an electromagnetic (“EM”) door lock system at various entry and exit points of the shopping mall on or around July 2018, in a bid to prevent mall patrons from wandering about after its closing hours. Relying on the Defendant’s recommendation, the Plaintiff awarded the installation works to Build Archive for $19,153.50. As it turned out however, the Defendant never activated the EM door lock system for its intended purpose. The EM door locks became a wasted expenditure.

8       Fourth, the Defendant failed to facilitate a full and proper handover of their managing agent portfolio to the incoming managing agent, Colliers. Various documents and information were missing during the handover and the Defendant’s representatives were not cooperative during the 2-week handover period. As a result, the Plaintiff had to incur an additional expense of about $7,988 for Colliers to deploy an additional staff on site from April 2019 to June 2019 to assist with a review of the Plaintiff’s documentation.

9       Fifth, the Defendant failed to timeously account for and bank in ten cheques that were received from the subsidiary proprietors and/or third parties. nine cheques amounting to $4,087,40 were issued by various subsidiary proprietors in August 2018 and the last cheque in the sum of $449,437.69 was issued by CEL Alexandra Pte Ltd (“CEL”) on or around 31 January 2019. Colliers discovered the cheques on or around 8 April 2019 but by then they have expired. The Plaintiff therefore claimed to have suffered loss of interest on the amounts drawn between the date of the cheques and the date of on which their replacements were issued. The Plaintiff proposed to peg the interest rate to the same interest rate imposed on subsidiary proprietors for contributions under s 40 of the BMSMA that remained unpaid after the 30th day it becomes due and payable.

10     Finally, the Plaintiff alleged that these breaches should be viewed against the backdrop of a tendency on the Defendant’s part to favour a particular contractor over others.

> (a)     At the expiry of Steadlink’s tenure, out of the 15 maintenance contracts, the Defendant recommended the renewal of all but two of them, namely, the landscaping and technician contractors. The Defendant recommended the Plaintiff to sign new landscaping and technician contractors on the purported basis that its recommended contractors were cheaper. However, the manner in which the Defendant gathered quotations and recommended the award of works was suspect.

> (b)     In the case of the landscaping contractor, the Defendant went out of the way to allow Oakland to submit its quotation on 25 March 2018, even though the existing landscaping contract had expired much earlier on 7 March 2018 and even though it had already received quotations from three other contractors much earlier between 12 and 16 March 2018. Further, the documents showed that the Defendant had recommended the Plaintiff to engage Oakland on 23 March 2018, two days before Oakland submitted its quotation on 25 March 2018. The inference was that the Defendant already decided to recommend Oakland even before it had sight of Oakland’s quotation. Further, Oakland was a new company incorporated on 10 April 2018, just days after it submitted its quotation to the Defendant, with a paid-up capital of $100.

> (c)     In the case of technician services contractor, the Defendant once again submitted the recommendation for the award of technician services contract to the Plaintiff before it had even received Build Archive’s quotation. In this regard, the documents showed that the Defendant submitted the recommendation on 27 March 2018 when it had only received the quotation on 28 March 2018.

> (d)     In respect of the award of the installation of the EM door locks in or around July 2018, the Defendant conducted a closed tender, inviting tenders from three companies, of which two were wholly owned by the same person, one “Lim Poh Cheow”. The two companies were Build Archive and 24 Ore Engineering Pte Ltd.

> (e)     In respect of the award of the hoarding works in or around October 2018, the Defendant conducted a closed tender, inviting tenders from three companies that were once again wholly owned one “Lim Poh Cheow”. Aside from Build Archive, the other two companies were 24 Ore Engineering Pte Ltd and IPC (Sin) Builder Pte Ltd.

> (f)     The Plaintiff subsequently discovered on or around February 2019 that Oakland was also wholly owned by one “Lim Poh Cheow”.

## Discussion

11     The Defendant did not dispute that it had indeed undertaken the alleged contractual duties. Instead, it took the position that the Plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proving that the Defendant had breached those duties. The other prevalent theme of the Defendant’s case is it did not call any witnesses with personal knowledge of the allegations to give evidence. Its sole witness, Mr Tan Beng Kiat Desmond (“Desmond”), the managing director of the Defendant, did not have personal knowledge of the material allegations. None of its representatives assigned to the Development were called to give evidence.

12     I will now examine the five claims in sequence. In the course of my discussion, I will also discuss and examine both the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s contentions.

### The Defendant failed to supervise the landscaping contractor

13     The Contract expressly provided that the Defendant was obliged to supervise contractors assigned to the Development. In this regard, the Defendant undertook to:

> (a)     ensure that all repairs and routine maintenance works undertaken by the contractors are carried out properly and completed satisfactorily in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective contracts (paragraph A(c) of Article 4 of Schedule 2 of the Contract) (the “1st Supervision Obligation”); and

> (b)     ensure that the contractors carry out their duties and responsibilities properly paragraph A(i) of Article 4 of Schedule 2 of the Contract) (the “2nd Supervision Obligation”).

14     In my judgment, the Plaintiff has established that the landscape was in a state of disrepair during the Defendant’s tenure. This was borne out by photographic evidence, contemporaneous documentary evidence and eye witness’ testimony.

> (a)     First, the Plaintiff adduced, through its witnesses, various photographs of the Development showing dead and withered plants.[^1] The Defendant took issue with the photographs not being taken by the Plaintiff’s witnesses, Ms Angeline Tan Chai Lian (“Angeline”) and Ms Neo Swee Leng Julie (“Julie”), but rather another employee of Colliers who was not called as a witness. Be that as it may, the Defendant did not dispute that the Plaintiff’s contention that the photographs were taken shortly after Colliers took over as managing agent and that the photographs were taken at the Development.[^2]

> (b)     Second, the photographs were corroborated by the eyewitness testimony of Angeline and Julie, who had both personally witnessed the state of the landscape on the occasions where they visited the Development.[^3]

>> (i)       Angeline, the Chairperson of the Plaintiff’s management council since September 2018, testified that she witnessed the damage on several occasions in January, February and March 2019. When asked when she had first witnessed the unsatisfactory landscape, Angeline said she could not recall the exact date but it was towards the end of 2018. The Defendant characterised Angeline’s evidence as “vague and inconsistent”. I disagreed. Angeline had merely supplemented her response when probed further by the Defendant’s counsel. Eyewitnesses cannot always be expected to remember every single detail of events that had occurred years ago at moment’s notice. In my view, she was sufficiently clear as to the state of the landscape and the approximate dates from which she started witnessing the unsatisfactory state of the landscape.

>> (ii)       Julie, the Property Manager assigned to the Development since 28 April 2019, shared a similar account of the unsatisfactory landscape condition when she visited the Development, referring to the same set of photographs exhibited in Angeline's AEIC.[^4] Julie’s evidence on this was not challenged during cross-examination.

> (c)     Third, the Defendant’s own employee, Ms Kaystal Koh (“Kaystal”) admitted on email to the Plaintiff’s council dated 19 February 2019 that the “landscape area … have been affected and not taken care of”, attaching photographs of what appears to be the damaged portions of the landscape. As Angeline explained during cross-examination, the council at that time raised concerns about the landscape condition and instructed the Defendant to take photographs of the same. This led to Kaystal taking photographs of the landscape condition and sending them to the council.[^5] Following this email, Mr Victor Naturale, the then Treasurer of the council,[^6] sought the council’s approval to, amongst others, “ask another landscaper to estimate the damage done” and give Oakland an opportunity to re-instate the landscape.[^7]

> (d)     Fourth, Colliers copied various employees of the Defendant in an email to the Plaintiff’s council dated 20 March 2019 reporting on the poor state of the landscape.[^8] Specifically, Colliers reported that “the landscape areas are full of weeds, wild creepers, dead plants and bold and compacted soil. Most of the planters creeper at the vertical wall along car park ramp are dead. There were 2 nos. of totally dead in the main entrance …” The Defendant did not reply to dispute the allegations therein. The Defendant submitted that the email was specifically addressed to the Plaintiff’s council. While that is true, the fact remains that the Defendant, being copied in the email, could have responded to dispute the allegations if it so wished.

> (e)     Fifth, the unsatisfactory landscape condition was also highlighted by Colliers in their emails to Oakland, shortly after they took over as managing agent. By their email dated 20 April 2019, Oakland confirmed various parts of the premises that required “reinstatement”, in reply to Collier’s email complaining that there were “lots of weeds and dead plants” and there were “many areas with bald spots”.[^9] This corroborates the Angeline’s and Julie’s evidence that the landscape condition was unsatisfactory and required reinstatement. Indeed, the Defendant heavily relied on the same exchange of correspondence in the cross-examination of Angeline, albeit to show that Colliers itself had difficulty managing Oakland. But it does not detract from the fact that Oakland had accepted that the landscape condition was poor and required rectification.

> (f)     Sixth, the replacement landscaper, Lucky Garden Floriculture Pte Ltd (“Lucky Garden”) made similar observations about the poor maintenance of the landscape in its takeover report dated 30 April 2019. I reproduce the report in its original wording as follows:[^10]

>> 1.1    Numerous of dead trees/plants were found along the boundary … and even creeper location at upper level carpark ramp.

>> 1.2    The estate is lack of maintenance for times. Weeds, wild plants, and fallen dry leaves are obviously left over at entire estate. Especially in front main entrance, in front hotel and shophouse, bin center.

>> 1.3    Due to Weed overtaken the place, there are many barren areas/ plants missing after dewed which required to replant back to fill up the gap.

>> 1.4    The planter boxes located at level 04 were bare. Bougainvillea was planted very far apart.

>> 1.5    The vertical green wall is destroyed. Current condition is quite bad- the wall is empty, plant not growing well, dead fern unremoved, most of plants are missing, the remaining is growing in-concept.

>> 1.6    A lot of parasitic creepers growing on top of the perimeter fence.

>> While Lucky Garden was not called as a witness, the Defendant did not challenge the authenticity or admissibility of this report either.[^11]

15     Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Defendant had itself pleaded in its Defence that ‘the Defendant realised that Oakland had not performed its “landscaping duties”’.[^12] Implicit in this averment was an admission that Oakland had fallen below the standards required of them in maintaining the landscape. It would therefore appear that the Defendant had made an about turn at trial and in closing submissions to dispute the condition of the landscape. In this regard, it is trite that parties are bound by their pleadings. Having averred to the fact that Oakland itself was in breach of its landscaping duties, the Defendant could not take a contrary position at trial without seeking leave to amend its pleadings. Indeed, the Defendant’s representative and witness, Desmond, conceded on the stand that he did not deny that Oakland was “in breach of \[its\] contract” and it “did not do the work properly”.[^13]

16     The Defendant submitted that the defects list dated 29 April 2019 prepared by Colliers for the Plaintiff only identified “Level 4 façade planter” and not the other damages alleged by the Plaintiff.[^14] Strangely, however, the Defendant did not appear to have cross-examined Julie on this matter, even though the defects list was adduced through her AEIC.[^15] Colliers may well have its reasons for not including this matter in the defects list and should have been given an opportunity to respond to this allegation pursuant to the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67. It may well be an oversight. Even assuming it were an oversight, this isolated omission was not sufficient to outweigh the overwhelming evidence against the Defendant as outlined above.

17     In my judgment, the above constitutes cogent evidence that the landscape condition was in disrepair towards the tail-end of the Defendant’s tenure and when Colliers took over the management of the Development from the Defendant. The very fact that the landscape condition was in disrepair shows that Oakland fell short of its duties to maintain the landscape. A reasonably qualified landscaper would not allow the landscape condition to fall into disrepair. Further, a reasonably competent managing agent would monitor the landscape condition of the Development, alerted the contractor of the issues and instructed the contractor to rectify them as and when they arise. The litany of damages that have accumulated by the time Colliers took over was _prima facie_ evidence that the Defendant did not discharge its duty to monitor the maintenance of the landscape and supervise the discharge of Oakland’s landscaping duties.

18     Against this, the Defendant could have led evidence to prove that they did in fact make efforts or attempts to supervise and manage Oakland but to no avail. Yet, they led no credible evidence of any such efforts or attempts. Instead, the Defendant sought to characterise Oakland as a “recalcitrant” contractor whom Colliers itself had difficulty managing.[^16] In my judgment, this argument was a non-starter for the simple reason that the Defendant did not make efforts to supervise them to begin with; any such difficulty was therefore speculative at best. Unlike the Plaintiff, the Defendant adduced no correspondence between themselves and Oakland showing that the Defendant had instructed Oakland to carry out reinstatement works but Oakland refused to do so. The allegation that Oakland was “recalcitrant” during its tenure was bare and unsubstantiated. In any event, even assuming for the sake of argument that Oakland was indeed uncooperative, it was entirely open to the Defendant to accept Oakland’s repudiation of the contract and engage a replacement contractor to carry out the landscaping duties. Allowing the landscape to fall into disrepair was not an option that a managing agent could accept.

19     The Defendant also submitted that the Plaintiff was oblivious to the Defendant’s efforts to supervise Oakland.[^17] In my judgment, this submission was misconceived because the Defendant would have been the best person to lead evidence on what it had done to supervise Oakland. Beyond that, it is trite law that the Plaintiff only needs to establish a _prima facie_ case on the evidence, upon which the evidential burden shifts to the Defendant to lead evidence to rebut the allegations (_Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith & Associates Far East, Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 855</span> at \[58\]-\[61\]). Here we have a defendant who, rather than proactively lead evidence to rebut the allegations, incredulously chose to pin the blame on the Plaintiff for not leading evidence to rebut the very allegation it was making against the Defendant. This is an astounding proposition that seeks to turn the law on evidential burden on its head.

20     In its reply submissions, the Defendant sought to rely on service reports purportedly issued by Oakland to show that the Defendant did supervise Oakland.[^18] It referred to two service reports dated 6 October 2018 and 20 October 2018 which stated in the comments section that “top soil have to be remove\[d\] and change\[d\]”. The Defendant also referred to the service report dated 9 July 2018 which contained observations on the grass erosion of the grass turfs around the Development. First of all, it was not even clear by whom those comments were written. If they were written by Oakland, then it did not support the Defendant’s case that the Defendant had proactively given instructions on rectifying damages on the landscape. Indeed, the report dated 9 July 2018 was issued by Oakland and not the Defendant. Further, as the Plaintiff had submitted, many of the service reports did not bear the Defendant’s stamp. It was also not clear who had supposedly “witnessed” the service reports issued by Oakland. Further, the Plaintiff pointed out that many of the service reports were apparently received “in batches” and not dated contemporaneously on the date of the purported servicing.[^19] Finally, even assuming for the sake of argument that the Defendant did witness the issuance of the service reports, it begs the question as to why the landscape had fallen into disrepair. There was a conspicuous dearth of documentary evidence showing what the Defendant had done to instruct Oakland to rectify the landscaping issues. It was noteworthy that the Defendant did not highlight the damages observed by the Plaintiff’s witnesses and as borne out in evidence in the routine service reports. Had the Defendant conducted routine inspections of the landscape, one would have expected the Defendant to have flagged out these issues in the service reports.

21     Finally, the Defendant submitted that “management corporations still have a duty to ensure that the service contractor engaged carry out their duties diligently” and cannot “exonerate themselves of their responsibilities”.[^20] It was not clear what was the legal premise of this submission. If the Defendant was submitting that there was some form of “contributory negligence” on the Plaintiff’s part, that has not been pleaded. No submissions were also made as to which contractual term, if any, was the Plaintiff in breach of by reason of the allegation. If the Defendant was arguing that the Plaintiff may be independently liable to subsidiary proprietors for failing to supervise Oakland, that issue was moot as the subsidiary proprietors were not parties to the action.

22     On the quantum of damages, the Plaintiff adduced invoices issued by Lucky Garden in the sum of $32,752.70 as evidence of the rectification works carried out to restore the landscaping. The Defendant did not lead evidence to dispute the cost of rectification. For instance, it could have adduced alternative quotations but chose not to do so. Instead, the Defendant argued that the costs of rectification in the sum of $32,752.70 was not confined to rectification works.[^21] In my judgment, that was once again pure speculation on the Defendant’s part. Lucky Garden’s quotations made reference to “replace the damage plants at the landscape area as follows…”, “the removal and transplanting of existing plant; re-do soil work for replanting” and “replace the dead plant vertical wall”. The express wording of the quotations was consistent with the proposed rectification works sought by the Plaintiff. While Lucky Garden also used phrases such as “enhancement works” and “improvement planting”, that must be read in the context of their scope of engagement, which was to rectify the damage on the landscape.

23     For these reasons, I found that the Defendant had breached its duty to supervise Oakland and assessed damages at $32,752.70.

### The Defendant wrongly advised the Plaintiff to install hoarding works and fund the installation using the sinking fund

24     The Plaintiff also claimed that the Defendant wrongly advised the Plaintiff to deduct the cost of installing hoarding works from its sinking fund. The hoarding works were installed at vacant units within the shopping mall, with the objective of beautifying the premises and prevent unauthorised entry into vacant units. The advice for the Plaintiff to fund the installation using its sinking fund was premised on the Plaintiff being able to subsequently recover the said costs from the incoming subsidiary “contractors/landlords”. This advice was recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the 2nd management council dated 14 September 2018 as follows:[^22]

> Hoarding up of unit

> Mr. Eric enquired on how the design of the hoarding will look like. MA shared that MCST will be subsidising the unit cost for the hoarding up first and subsequently when the unit is tenanted out, the hoarding cost amount can be claimed back from the incoming contractors/landlords which is required by default to be constructed before renovation works commences. MA reminded that hoarding cost will come from the sinking fund as per the resolution passed.

25     The Defendant repeated its advice in the recommendation for award of works dated 5 October 2018, as follows:[^23]

> B. Brief Description of Works

> To supply labour and materials to install wooden frame to ceiling and hoarding with lockset for vacant units at Alexandra Central. The provision was approved during the 2nd AGM under Special Resolution 9.5 (please see attached file)

> …

> E. Recommendation

> MA recommends to award the works to Build Archive as they provided the lowest quote. The hoarding will be charged back to the contractors of each unit before commencing renovation works.”

26     It was apparent from these documents that the Defendant sought to justify its advice based on resolution 9.5 of the 2nd Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) held on 29 August 2018. The Defendant took the same position in its Defence, at trial and in closing submissions. Resolution 9.5 reads as follows:[^24]

> Hoarding and internal Façade Requirements

> To empower the incoming Management council to draft and implement a new by-law regarding the hoarding up of vacant units.

> Current by-laws require a unit under renovation to hoard up the unit to prevent dust and debris from ongoing renovation works from polluting the common property.

> The new by-law to be drafted by the incoming Management Council will be added as an addendum to that section of the by-law which will require units that are currently vacant to be hoarded up, to prevent illegal access to the vacant unit by patrons of the mall during the night time hours.

> It will also act to beauty the mall by preventing empty units from being exposed to the general public during operating hours. To present a more professional image to the general public.

27     The Defendant submitted that it had properly advised the Plaintiff that the hoarding works were necessary to prevent unauthorised entry into vacant units and to beautify the mall.[^25] That purported objective may well have been valid. But the Defendant’s advice was nevertheless flawed because resolution 9.5 did not actually authorise the Plaintiff to first, install the hoarding works on its own motion at vacant units without the subsidiary proprietor’s consent; and second, charge the cost of the installation to the sinking fund. In advising the Plaintiff to perform these actions, the Defendant had either misread resolution 9.5 or wrongly assumed that resolution 9.5 authorised the Plaintiff to pursue this course of action. All resolution 9.5 did was signal an intention to “draft and implement” a by-law to require vacant units to hoard up its premises. It said nothing about the person who was responsible for installing the hoarding works and funding the cost of its installation. Indeed, Angeline’s evidence was that the issue of costs was not considered or discussed at the 2nd AGM. Accordingly, the Plaintiff had no authority to install the hoarding works on the subsidiary proprietor’s behalf and charge the same to the “incoming contractor/landlord”.

28     The Plaintiff submitted that by-laws are akin to statutory contracts that are binding on the management corporation and the subsidiary proprietors (_Chia Sok Kheng Kathleen v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 669_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 27</span> at \[41\]). I agreed. Without certainty on the key terms of the contract – which in this case includes the cost of the hoarding works – there is no valid and enforceable contract to begin with. Subsidiary proprietors have a right to know how the proposed hoarding works would be installed and who would bear the cost of its installation. Resolution 9.5 did not give the Plaintiff – or the Defendant for that matter – the mandate to charge whatever amount it deemed fit to the sinking fund and thereafter claim such costs against the incoming “contractor/landlord”.

29     The problem was compounded by the fact that the proposed by-law had not even been passed. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the Defendant was correct to assume resolution 9.5 did authorise to install the hoarding works and charge the same to the incoming “contractor/landlord”, it remained for the Plaintiff to formally draft the by-law and table it for approval at a general meeting. Until that was done, the Plaintiff had no authority to install hoarding works and fund such installation from its sinking fund. I was fortified in my view by the prescribed statutory framework for the passing and lodgement of by-laws, which stipulates various steps to be taken before a by-law has legal effect. In this regard, s 32 of the BMSMA requires the management corporation to do the following:

> (a)     First, the management must give at least 21-day notice of the proposed by-law framed as a motion to the subsidiary proprietors (s 2(3)(a) of the BMSMA).

> (b)     Second, the motion must be passed by a special resolution at a duly convened general meeting (s 32(3) read with s 2(3)(b) of the BMSMA).

> (c)     Third, a copy of the by-law certified as true copy under the seal of the management corporation must be lodged with the Commissioner of Buildings no later than the 45th day after the passing of the resolution (s 32(5) of the BMSMA).

30     It was not disputed that, until and unless the three-step procedure has been duly complied with, a proposed by-law has no legal effect. In the present case, none of the steps were undertaken. In fact, the by-law had not even been drafted. The upshot of this is that resolution 9.5 had no legal effect. Unfortunately, the Defendant nevertheless advised the Plaintiff to proceed with the hoarding works as though resolution 9.5 had the effect of a by-law. This assumption turned out to be erroneous.

31     Further, the Defendant’s advice for the Plaintiff to fund the installation from the sinking fund contravened s 38(6) of the BMSMA. The provision, which regulates the usage of sinking funds, reads:

> (6)    A management corporation shall not disburse any moneys from its sinking fund otherwise than for the purpose of –

>> (a)    meeting its liabilities referred to in section 39(2); or

>> (b)    carrying out its powers, authorities, duties or functions under this Act.

32     Section 39(2) of the BMSMA referred to in the provision provides a list of capital expenditure items as well as a “catch-all” clause that captures all “other liabilities expected to be incurred at a future time where the management corporation determines in a general meeting that the whole or part thereof should be met from its sinking fund.” There was no evidence of the subsidiary proprietors having approved the usage of sinking funds. Any such approval ought to have been recorded in the minutes of meeting. In these circumstances, the Plaintiff had no authority to use that to fund the installation of hoarding works.

33     Finally, reference may be made to resolution 9.4 of the same minutes, which provides a positive example of how authority could have been conferred on the Plaintiff. It expressly authorised _the Plaintiff’s council_ to undertake modification works and stipulated the _amount of money deductible from the sinking fund_ for that purpose. Resolution 9.4 reads:

> To empower the incoming Management Council to undertake modification works to the façade fountain water feature at the main entrance, to convert it into an event space and to decide on its design and to fulfil all requirements by any government authorities, if any. At a cost not exceeding SGD$50,000 to be expended from the Sinking Fund.

34     The upshot of the above analysis is that the Defendant’s advice was both factually and legally unsustainable. It was factually unsustainable because resolution 9.5 did not actually authorise the Plaintiff to install the hoarding works and charge the same to the sinking fund. It was legally unsustainable because resolution 9.5 did not have the legal effect of a by-law. Further, the Plaintiff, contrary to the Defendant’s advice, did not have the authority to charge the cost of installation to the sinking fund. The Plaintiff also did not have the legal right to recover the cost of installation from the subsidiary proprietors because resolution 9.5 did not purport to confer such right on the Plaintiff. The erroneous advice puts the Defendant in breach of its duty to act competently (clause 7(a) of the Contract) as well as the duty to be familiar with the statutory provisions of the BMSMA in order that it may provide good and sufficient guidance and assistance to the Plaintiff and its council in complying with such provisions of the BMSMA (clause 7(i) of the Contract).

35     The Defendant submitted that while resolution 9.5 was silent on the issue of costs, the Plaintiff was supposed to draft and implement a by-law that would allow the Plaintiff to pay for the costs upfront and claim reimbursement from the incoming subsidiary proprietors.[^26] The Defendant faulted the Plaintiff for not drafting and implementing the by-law.[^27] This submission was in my view misguided. Resolution 9.5 did not impose a deadline for the Plaintiff to draft the by-law and table it for approval. It would be apparent from s 32 of the BMSMA as discussed above that the drafting, passing and lodgement of by-laws would require time. Without waiting for the proposed by-law to be drafted, passed and lodged, the Defendant launched into providing the erroneous advice just two to three weeks later. In doing so, the Defendant appears to have erroneously assumed that resolution 9.5 stood as a valid by-law. Indeed, the Defendant took the view that resolution was “effectively the by-law” in its further submissions.[^28] In reality, there was no valid and binding by-law to justify the Defendant’s advice.

36     The Defendant also submitted that the Plaintiff was at liberty to pass the by-law without tabling it for approval at another general meeting.[^29] I disagreed. As I have explained above, resolution 9.5 was too vague as to the terms of the proposed by-law to stand as a valid and enforceable by-law. There was notably no discussion or agreement on who would install the hoarding works and bear the cost of its installation. It could equally have been understood by some to mean that it was the subsidiary proprietor who was supposed to do the installation. Even if that were the case, there was a further question as to whether the responsibility should be borne by the outgoing or incoming subsidiary proprietor. Indeed, even the Defendant appeared to be unclear about who should bear the cost, by the vague reference made to “contractor/landlord” in its advice. This reinforced my view that resolution 9.5 was too vague and uncertain to stand as a valid and enforceable by-law.

37     The Defendant also submitted that the issue of costs would likely have been discussed and deliberated during the 2nd AGM.[^30] It further submitted that “no evidence was led one way or another … as to the detailed discussions which took place at the 2nd AGM. This was a bare assertion that was not only unsupported by documentary evidence but also contradicted by Angeline’s testimony. As discussed above, Angeline unequivocally said that the issue of costs was not discussed at the meeting. This was consistent with the minutes of meeting which made no reference to the issue of costs insofar as resolution 9.5 is concerned. In contrast, resolution 9.4 made express provision for costs of certain works to be deducted from the sinking fund. The natural inference was that the issue of costs was not discussed and agreed upon for the installation of the hoarding works.

38     The Defendant also submitted that only one subsidiary proprietor took issue with the wrongful installation of the hoarding works.[^31] For context, on 4 April 2019, one of the subsidiary proprietors wrote to Colliers complaining that the hoarding works was done without seeking his permission and demanded them to be removed.[^32] Following this complaint, Colliers looked into the minutes of the 2nd AGM and took the view that the Defendant’s advice was wrong and advised the Plaintiff against recovering the installation costs from the subsidiary proprietors. In my judgment, the number of complaints was a red herring. The cause of action against the Defendant was not predicated on _third parties_ raising complaints. The advice was given to the Plaintiff and it was the Plaintiff who had relied on the advice. The argument that more subsidiary proprietors could have raised issues but had not distracts the court from the real inquiry which was whether the Defendant had fallen short of its obligations.

39     Finally, the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff never attempted to demand payment of the costs from the subsidiary proprietors and simply assumed they would not pay.[^33] This argument was in my view flawed. In short, the Defendant was essentially expecting the Plaintiff to seek reimbursement of the installation costs despite knowing that they had no legal right to do so. In my view, the Plaintiff had the right not to insist on pursuing a course of action that was legally unfounded. In any event, this argument goes towards mitigation which must be specifically pleaded. The Defence was silent on this mitigatory measure. The Plaintiff would be prejudiced if the Defendant were allowed to run this argument without amending its pleadings. For instance, the Plaintiff could have, in response to this putative pleading, attempted to seek reimbursement from the subsidiary proprietors.

40     For these reasons, I found that the Defendant wrongly advised the Plaintiff to install the hoarding works and to charge the cost of installation to the sinking fund, in breach of its duty to act competently as well as its duty to be familiar with the statutory provisions of the BMSMA in order that it may provide good and sufficient guidance and assistance to the Plaintiff and its council in complying with such provisions of the BMSMA. Had the Defendant properly advised the Plaintiff on the effect of resolution 9.5, the Plaintiff was unlikely to have proceeded with the installation of the hoarding works and charge the cost of installation to the sinking fund. The Plaintiff incurred an installation cost of $67,000 in reliance of the Defendant’s advice. In these circumstances, I assessed damages at $67,000.

### The Defendant wrongly advised the installation of EM door locks

41     The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant wrongly advised the Plaintiff to install EM door locks at entry and exit points of the shopping mall. The locks were never activated for its intended use.

42     The Defendant first recommended the installation of the EM locks on 11 June 2018.[^34] The recommendation was apparently prompted by a desire to “lock down the shopping mall doors after closing hours at 10 pm” to prevent pub patrons from vomiting in common areas and damaging common property.[^35] One of the council members, Ms Angelynn Yap, suggested brainstorming better solutions before proceeding with the recommendation.[^36] The Defendant replied affirming its recommendation to install the EM door locks “for the security of the mall”. In its recommendation for award of works dated 19 July 2018, the Defendant reiterated that the EM door lock system would prevent “unauthorized entry of premise during shopping mall closing hours”.[^37] After deliberation, the Plaintiff decided to accept the Defendant’s recommendation.

43     According to Angeline, the EM door locks were installed in or around November 2018.[^38] Since then however, the Defendant never activated the EM door locks because they were not functioning well. There were also safety concerns that patrons might be accidentally trapped inside the mall when the locks were activated. She stated that the locks soon became a white elephant and an unnecessary expenditure. The shopping mall continued to operate without the locks being activated for use. After its installation, there was no evidence of the Plaintiff receiving any complaints that had initially prompted the installation of the EM door locks.

44     The Defendant did not lead evidence to refute Angeline’s evidence. As mentioned above, the Defendant did not call any of the representatives assigned to the Development to explain why it did not activate the locks for the proposed purpose. In these circumstances, the Defendant failed to rebut the Plaintiff’s allegations on the EM door locks being unnecessary and wasteful. This was a hefty expenditure costing the Plaintiff $19,153.50.[^39] It was apparent from the available evidence that the recommendation was misconceived or at the very least not properly thought through. In my judgment, a reasonably competent managing agent ought to have considered and planned the usage of the EM door locks before recommending the Plaintiff to undertake such a hefty expenditure. As a professional, the managing agent ought to have studied the floor plans first. If there were potential pitfalls or shortcomings to the proposed project, it ought to have highlighted them to the management corporation to the extent that they are reasonably foreseeable. The Defendant did none of these. It launched into issuing the recommendation without considering how the EM door locks were supposed to be implemented. For this reason, I found that the Defendant breached its duty to act competently and diligently (clause 7(a) of the Contract).

45     The Defendant submitted that the EM door locks was necessary for the Development.[^40] It blamed the Plaintiff’s council for not activating the locks.[^41] With respect, this was an unsubstantiated allegation. The unrefuted evidence was that it was the Defendant who decided not to activate the locks. The Defendant led no evidence to show that the locks were not activated because the Plaintiff had instructed the Defendant not to do so.

46     The Defendant also submitted that it was open to the Plaintiff to install workarounds to allow the locks to function as intended. For instance, it was suggested that the Plaintiff could have addressed the concern of patrons being trapped within the mall by installing phone booths beside the locks.[^42] In my judgment, if this was a viable alternative, the Defendant itself could and should have recommended it to the Plaintiff and implemented it, to allow the locks to function as intended. Having recommended the Plaintiff to install the locks, the onus was on the Defendant, as the professional managing agent, to ensure the locks would become functional. In this regard, the Defendant’s managing director, Desmond, agreed on the stand that the Defendant was not a new or run-of-the-mill managing agent. According to Desmond, it was a leading managing agent with more than 160 residential and commercial developments under its charge. He agreed that the Defendant should be held to the standard equivalent to its purported reputation.[^43] However, it sought to blame the Plaintiff for failing to conceive and implement ways to put the locks into good use. Further, and in any event, it was not clear what was the legal basis of this argument. If the Defendant’s argument goes towards mitigation of damages, mitigation of damages should be specifically pleaded (_Yip Holdings Pte Ltd v Asia Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 131</span>). Since the Plaintiff failed to plead this, I was unable to accept this argument. The Defendant cited the case of _Koh Tiam Ting v Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 172</span> at \[29\] where the court allowed the defendant to run an argument on mitigation of damages even though it was not pleaded. But the reason the court did that was because the plaintiff in that case knew it was a live issue before the commencement of the assessment of damages and stated on record that it was not objecting to the defendant’s failure to plead that matter. The same cannot be said here. The Plaintiff challenged the Defendant’s failure to plead this. The Plaintiff should be given ample opportunity to properly investigate, lead evidence and respond to this allegation. For instance, the Plaintiff could have investigated and led evidence on the viability of the proposed workaround. They could have potentially called expert evidence. It was too late for the Defendant to spring this new allegation upon the Plaintiff at trial or in closing submissions. Further and in any event, the Defendant led no evidence on the cost of the proposed workarounds. In these circumstances, this was an academic argument.

47     The Defendant further submitted that the Plaintiff eventually activated the EM locks to regulate traffic during the Covid-19 pandemic and thus cannot reasonably recover the cost of the locks having enjoyed the benefit of it.[^44] However, Angeline and Julie testified that the Plaintiff only activated the EM door locks because they were already installed. The Plaintiff did not actually have to activate them.[^45] Instead, it was open to the Plaintiff to manually lock up the access points.[^46] The Defendant was essentially asking the Plaintiff to pay for something that they deemed superfluous. The Defendant then submitted that the Plaintiff’s true loss would have been the difference between the costs of the EM door locks and the “less costly options”.[^47] This submission once again goes towards mitigation of damages which ought to have been pleaded. No evidence was led on the “less costly options” ostensibly because the Defendant did not plead mitigation of damages. In any event, the manual locking of access points is unlikely to have incurred substantial costs.

48     For these reasons, I found that the Defendant’s recommendation to install the EM door locks was poorly thought through. It was apparent from the evidence that the Defendant did not give sufficient thought to the implementation of the project and did not properly advise the Plaintiff on how to navigate potential issues that may arise in its implementation. Instead, it was content on allowing the EM door locks to remain unused since its installation in November 2018 till the end of its appointment in March 2019. The Defendant’s submission that the project was desirable misses the point. Desirable as the project may be, the Defendant ought to have considered its practicality before recommending it to the Plaintiff, not least because of its hefty expenditure. Unfortunately, the Defendant overlooked this aspect of the project.

49     For these reasons, I found that the Defendant misadvised the Plaintiff on the installation of the EM door locks, in breach of its duty to act diligent and competently. Had the Defendant properly advised the Plaintiff of the shortcomings of the EM door locks, the Plaintiff was unlikely to have proceeded with the installation. The Plaintiff incurred an installation cost of $19,153.50 in reliance of the Defendant’s advice. In these circumstances, I assessed the Plaintiff’s damages at $19,153.50.

### The Defendant failed to conduct a full and proper handover

50     The Defendant did not dispute that it had a duty to conduct a proper handover of the management of the Development to the incoming managing agent, Colliers.

51     The sequence of the handover process was largely undisputed. The Plaintiff issued notice of termination to the Defendant on 20 February 2019. On 6 March 2019, the Plaintiff notified the Defendant of Collier’s appointment as the incoming managing agent and that Colliers would start the takeover process from 7 March 2019 onwards. The Plaintiff asked the Defendant to render all assistance necessary to ensure a smooth and seamless takeover.[^48] The next day, Colliers emailed the Defendant a non-exhaustive checklist and informed the Defendant that they would be dropping by the Development from 11 March 2019 onwards. Colliers further offered to drop by from 8 March 2019 onwards to facilitate any queries that the Defendant might have on the handover process. There was no evidence of the Defendant responding directly to this email. Instead, Colliers emailed the Defendant again on 11 March 2019 providing a detailed schedule for the takeover. Target dates were listed for various items, ranging from 12-15 March 2019, before the Defendant was supposed to hand over keys on 18 March 2019.[^49] Colliers also informed the Defendant that they would be stationed at the Development every day from Monday to Friday to understudy the operations on site. Once again, the Defendant did not reply to this email. On 15 March 2019, Colliers wrote to the Defendant providing an update on the check list. Despite being just days away from the official handover date, many of the items were still marked as pending and incomplete. In particular:[^50]

> (a)     the “as-built drawings” was marked as “not found in Management Office but only CD Rom”;

> (b)     the inventory list for equipment and furniture was marked as “pending by \[the Defendant\]”;

> (c)     the “procedures (current SOP of Alexandra Central Mall)” for the shopping mall was marked as “pending by \[the Defendant\]”;

> (d)     the leasing information was marked as “pending by \[the Defendant\]”; and

> (e)     the fire safety monthly reports were marked as “not in full set”. Reports for various months were apparently missing. Only the annual report for 2015 and 2016 was described as available.

52     It was only after this email that the Defendant’s representative, Mr Mike Huang (“Mike”), the complex manager of the Development, finally replied on 15 March 2019 asking his “team” to “expedite” the handover process. He also questioned Kaystal for apparently telling him that there was no “handover to do on \[her\] side”, asking her to “please make sure”.[^51]

53     On 18 March 2019 at about 10.12 am, Colliers emailed the Defendant expressing disappointment that:

> (a)     they were still waiting for the Defendant to conduct the handover and briefing, even though Colliers was supposed to officially take over on that day;

> (b)     Mike was on leave and Kaystal was “on the way to office later today only”;

> (c)     Colliers was only taking over the “admin assistant section only \[in\] the presence of \[the Defendant’s\] Admin Assistant Ardi”;

> (d)     Colliers was still waiting for the “Outstanding List” that was discussed last week and it asked the Defendant to furnish the said list by 19 March 2019, 10 am; and

> (e)     in light of the above, Colliers requested to reschedule the official handover to 19 March 2019, 9 am to 6 pm.

54     Once again, there was no record of the Defendant replying to this email. It was only the next day on 19 March 2019 at around 1.47 am that Mr Philip Pang, Associate Director of the Defendant, emailed Angeline to seek permission for Kaystal to “take lead” in the “final handing over process on 19 March 2019”.[^52] Angeline replied later that morning at 9.20 am expressing disappointment with the Defendant. She reminded the Defendant that:

> (a)     the Plaintiff had emphasised the need to do a “proper handover to Colliers since \[they arrived\] on site \[on\] 11 March 2019”;

> (b)     despite Colliers providing a list of items, there was “completely no proper handover and update on pending and outstanding issues”;

> (c)     Mike was on 2-day medical leave and he had “not been cooperative during this transition period”; and

> (d)     the Defendant’s latest email gave the Plaintiff no choice but to allow Kaystal to take the lead in the handing over process on 19 March 2019.

55     The handover was eventually conducted by Kaystal, in place of Mike, on 19 March 2019.[^53] The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to handover the following documents:

> (a)     the original hardcopy of as-built drawings;

> (b)     the original structural drawings;

> (c)     the original strata title plan;

> (d)     the Plaintiff’s accounts; and

> (e)     the complete set of the fire safety manager monthly reports.

56     The Plaintiff further averred that the Defendant failed to furnish correct or complete information on the following:

> (a)     defects liability period;

> (b)     the practical completion date; and

> (c)     the reason for which some of the licences for the outdoor advertising signs had expired and were not renewed.

57     As a result of the alleged improper handover, the Plaintiff took the view that it had to appoint an additional Collier’s staff to first, go through all of the Plaintiff’s records to locate the relevant documents; and second, to conduct a full review of the Plaintiff’s documents to make sure they are in order.

58     Based on the handover form dated 19 March 2019 signed by both the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s representatives, some documents and information were indeed not handed over properly. For instance, the following information were marked as “unsure”: approval letter from LTA for building plans; approval letter from National Parks; date of defects liability period; and date of practical completion. Some of the built-drawings were also marked as “not available” and “not in-full”. The accounts page was also left blank, with the remarks “N.A.”, which indicated that they were not available. Colliers had also in their email dated 15 March 2019 informed the Defendant that the “FMS monthly reports are not in full set”. This was reiterated in their email dated 20 March 2019 to the Plaintiff in which the Defendant was copied. The Defendant did not lead evidence to refute the allegations. None of those involved in the handover were called as witnesses.

59     In my judgment, the above sufficiently showed that the Defendant failed to conduct a full and proper handover of the documents and information to Colliers by the end of their term.

60     The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff’s claim was not anchored on any legal cause of action. I disagreed. It cannot be seriously disputed that the Defendant, as with any competent managing agent, ought to ensure a smooth and proper handover to the incoming managing agent. This was in keeping with their duty to act competently and diligently (clause 7(a) of the Contract).

61     The Defendant further submitted that it did provide Colliers with regular updates on the handover process. This was once again an unsubstantiated allegation. The contemporaneous emails show that the Defendant was largely unresponsive and uncoordinated during the handover process. While there may have been updates given to Colliers on site, various items were still outstanding as at 15 March 2019. Angeline called the Defendant’s Mike Huang “uncooperative during this transition period”, an allegation which the Defendant did not disagree.

62     The Defendant also submitted that it was unnecessary to hire a temporary administrative assistant, and if Colliers required further documents or information, it could have approached the Defendant directly.[^54] Insofar as liability is concerned, I did not agree that the Plaintiff was under any obligation to continue engaging the Defendant when their tenure had come to an end. The Plaintiff had given the Defendant ample opportunity to perform its handover obligation leading up to the handover date. They failed to do so. This puts them in breach of their duty to do a proper handover to the incoming management agent.

63     In terms of damages, the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff should have, in keeping with its duty to mitigate its damages, liaised with the Defendant to rectify the handover issues. I rejected this submission as the Defendant failed to plead mitigation in its Defence. I was unable to agree with the Defendant that the argument can be pursued without prejudice to the Plaintiff. That was pure speculation on the Defendant part. Further and in any event, I rejected this submission for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, given the Defendant uncooperative stance and cavalier attitude towards the handover, there was no reason for the Plaintiff to assume that reaching out to the Defendant after the handover would have yielded any positive outcome. It was understandable for the Plaintiff to troubleshoot matters on its own. The Defendant’s submission was tantamount to saying an innocent party bears the legal duty to proactively request the contract breaker to mitigate the damages. No authority was cited in support of this proposition.

> (b)     In any event, the fact of the matter was that the Defendant was privy to the improper handover and could have taken steps to mitigate the damages if it had wanted to. This would be evident from Angeline’s email dated 19 March 2019 and Collier’s email dated 20 March 2019 in which the Defendant was copied.[^55]

64     That being said, I was of the view that the breach did not appear to justify employing an additional staff for a full three months. Indeed, the Plaintiff’s own case was that, apart from locating the missing documents, the temporary staff also conducted a “full review” of the Plaintiff’s documents to make sure they are in order.[^56] In my view, the missing documents were isolated and discrete parts of the records which did not justify a full-fledged and sweeping review of the entire records, which appeared to have been what was done. To make matters worse, the invoices issued by Colliers for the deployment of the additional staff in the sum of $7,988 did not give a breakdown of the actual work done by the said staff. I decided to moderate the additional staff cost to $2,000 which would appear to be a more fair and reasonable expense required to locate the missing documents and information.

### The Defendant failed to bank in cheques received from subsidiary proprietors

65     The Plaintiff claimed that ten cheques were received by the Defendant but not banked in timeously, resulting in the Plaintiff losing out of interest it could have earned on the sums drawn.

66     The Defendant did not dispute that it owed a duty to “charge, receive, manage, demand and recover payment of … charges payable to the \[Plaintiff\] from all the subsidiary proprietors of the Development” and to “maintain proper records of all such and other payments received” (paragraph B(a), Article 4, Schedule 2 of the Contract). The Defendant also did not dispute that it received nine out of the ten cheques totalling the sum of $4,087.40 and did not bank them in for more than six months resulting in the expiry of those cheques. The dispute centres on whether the Defendant had received the 10th cheque for the sum of $449,437.69 which was the quarterly maintenance and sinking fund contribution made by CEL, the single largest subsidiary proprietor of the Development.

67     No direct evidence was led to prove that the Defendant had received the 10th cheque. Instead, the Plaintiff relied on an email from CEL informing Colliers that they had sent the cheque to the Defendant on 31 January 2019 by courier, attaching a copy of the courier slip.[^57] The Plaintiff then alleged that the courier delivered the cheque to a security officer by the name of “Kannan” of A Best Security Pte Ltd, the security firm appointed for the Development. It submitted that it would be “reasonable to assume” that Kannan would have notified the Defendant and gotten its approval to accept the cheque on its behalf, and that Kannan would “ordinarily have forwarded it to the Defendant”.[^58] This was consistent with the Defendant’s “lack of follow up” on this issue.[^59] According to its arrears management policy, the Defendant was supposed to issue a statement 30 days from the invoice date, a reminder 60 days from the invoice date and an internal demand letter 90-120 days from the invoice date, as the initial steps to demand payment. In this case, the tax invoices issued by the Defendant to CEL were dated 1 January 2019. The Plaintiff then referred to an email dated 8 April 2019 from CEL stating that CEL never received any statement or reminder from the Defendant. The Defendant also did not alert Colliers of this matter at the handover. It was only after Colliers auto-generated and issued its tax invoice to CEL on 1 April 2020 that this issue finally came to light.[^60]

68     The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff was unable to prove that the Defendant had received the cheque issued by CEL.

69     In my judgment, the Plaintiff did not adduce sufficient evidence to prove that the Defendant received the cheque from CEL. Julie alleged that Colliers had checked with the security officer who assured them that he had passed the cheque to the Defendant’s management office.[^61] But that security guard was not called as a witness. As such, the allegation that he had passed the cheque to the Defendant was hearsay and inadmissible. While the Defendant did not issue reminders to CEL for payment of the cheque, that does not necessarily mean that the Defendant had received the cheque. It could equally be the result of the Defendant overlooking the matter altogether. Given the dearth of evidence proving receipt, I was unable to find in favour of the Plaintiff on this issue.

70     At a hearing convened for parties to address some queries I had after considering their closing submissions, I queried whether, even assuming the Defendant did not receive the cheque, the Defendant’s failure to issue payment reminders to CEL amounted to a separate and independent breach of its contractual obligations. I queried whether, even assuming the Defendant did not receive the cheque, it ought to have followed up with CEL and asked them to re-issue the cheque. I invited parties to file further submissions on this matter. Having reviewed the further submissions, I agreed with the Defendant that this cause of action had not been properly pleaded by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff did not expressly plead that the Defendant had failed to issue payment reminders to CEL. Its pleaded case was simply that the cheque was received but misplaced by the Defendant. It is trite that parties are bound by their pleadings and the court rarely grants judgment beyond the ambit of the pleaded case (_Loy Chin Associates Pte Ltd v Autohouse Trading Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 740</span> at \[20\]). In these circumstances, I was unable to find that the Defendant was in breach of its contractual duties for failing to issue payment reminders to CEL.

71     I turn now to discuss the issue of damages in respect of the nine cheques (totalling $4,087.40) that were undisputedly received by the Defendant in August 2018 but not deposited.[^62] The nine cheques were located by Colliers in or around April 2019.[^63] The Plaintiff claimed loss of interest at 12%, the same rate imposed on subsidiary proprietors for contributions under s 40 of the BMSMA that remained unpaid after the 30th day it becomes due and payable. The Defendant submitted that the rate of 12% per annum sought was excessive. Any loss of interest ought to be computed based on the prevailing bank interest rate which the Plaintiff would have earned had the cheques been timeously deposited.[^64] I agreed with the Defendant on this issue. 12% per annum was the rate of interest payable by subsidiary proprietors, not the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s evidence was that the cheques would have been banked into an ordinary bank account had they been timeously received. Accordingly, the real loss to the Plaintiff would be the prevailing interest rate that would have accrued on those bank deposits. Angeline testified that the Plaintiff would have at best deposited the funds into a fixed deposit account at an interest rate of 1.65% per annum. I awarded the Plaintiff interest at this rate on the nine cheques. Parties agreed to calculate interest from the date of the last cheque (22 August 2018) to the date of the Writ of Summons (11 July 2019), totalling $42.50. I ordered the Defendant to pay this sum.

## Conclusion

72     In summary, I allowed the claims in part and assessed damages as follows:

> (a)     breach of duty to supervise Oakland: $32,752.70;

> (b)     wrongful advice to install hoarding works and charge the cost of installation to the sinking fund: $67,000;

> (c)     wrongful advice to install the EM door locks: $19,153.50;

> (d)     failure to conduct a full and proper handover: $2,000; and

> (e)     loss of interest on the unbanked cheques: $42.50.

73     The aggregate sum of the damages was $120,948.70.

74     As the Plaintiff was largely successful in this action, I ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff costs and disbursements fixed at $38,000 and $13,179 respectively. Costs was assessed on an indemnity basis after 4 August 2020, the date on which the Plaintiff served the Defendant with an offer to settle, which turned out to be more favourable than the judgment sum.
