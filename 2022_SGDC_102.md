36     Sometime in August 2019, Yuzwan approached the accused for ideas to raise some quick money. The accused suggested to Yuzwan that he could pretend to lease cameras from persons under the pretence of renting them, and thereafter sell the said cameras without the owner’s permission on Carousell. He further informed Yuzwan that he had been successful in raising money through this manner in the past.

37     As Yuzwan was unfamiliar with Carousell, the accused taught him how to create an account on the platform. He then used Yuzwan’s account to contact potential victims and would ask Yuzwan to meet up with the victims to collect the cameras.

38     On 28 August 2019, the accused contacted one Loh Jun You, Darrell (“Loh”) using Yuzwan’s Carousell account. He represented himself as Yuzwan and agreed to rent a camera and camera related items from Loh for three days at a price of $140.

39     The total value of the said items amounted to $6,046.

40     In pursuance of their conspiracy, Yuzwan met Loh on 30 August 2019 at Tanah Merah MRT station, Singapore. Thereat, he deceived Loh into believing that he was renting the items and will return them to Loh after the rental period of three days. Both Yuzwan and the accused knew that this was false as they never intended to return the items. This dishonestly induced Loh to deliver the said items to him.

42     To date, no restitution has been made.

43     With regard to the 14th charge, the co-accused was Muhammad Rizwan Bin Mohd Ismail (**“**Rizwan”), a 33-year-old male Singaporean. At the time of the offences, he was a parttime mover.

44     Sometime in May 2019, Rizwan told the accused that he needed cash. The accused then told Rizwan that he had a way to help him get “fast cash” and asked if he was interested in doing a “camera business”. The accused then elaborated that Rizwan could pretend to lease cameras from persons under the pretence of renting them, and thereafter sell the said cameras without the owner’s permission. He further informed Rizwan to lodge a false police report after selling the items to state that he had lost the cameras so that the camera’s owner does not suspect that he was a scammer. Rizwan agreed to the accused’s idea.

45     Thereafter, the accused helped Rizwan search for potential victims on Carousell who are interested in renting out their cameras. Sometime in May 2019, the accused liaised with one Jasper Phua Kai Wen (“Phua”). He then asked Rizwan to head to the pick-up point on 16 May 2019 to collect the camera from Phua.

48     After receiving the items, the accused met Rizwan at Peninsula Plaza, Singapore on the same day. Thereat, they proceeded to sell the Sony A7RIII camera and the Sony FE 70200 F/2.8 Gm lens for $2,100 at a camera store. Rizwan gave the accused $500 for the sale. Rizwan then disposed the remaining items. On 18 May 2019, Rizwan failed to return the cheated items to Phua.

49     To date, no restitution has been made.

### Facts pertaining to the 19th charge (Abetment of false information)

50     On 16 May 2019, after selling the items at Peninsula Plaza, the accused told Rizwan to go and lodge a police report to show Phua that he had lost the items rented from him. Consequently, in pursuance of their conspiracy, Rizwan filed a police report at Bukit Merah East Neighbourhood Police Centre on 18 May 2019 at about 12.15am. The report was received by one Senior Staff Sergeant Khairul Izhan Bin Jaafar (“SSG Khairul”), a public servant from the Singapore Police Force. In his report, Rizwan claimed that he had misplaced a camera and camera related items in a ComfortDelGro Taxi:

51     Both the accused and Rizwan knew that this was false. The false information provided was intended to cause SSG Khairul to omit investigating or prosecuting Rizwan, which ought to have been done if the true state of facts respecting which such information was given were known to SSG Khairul.

60     The main areas of sentencing contention between the prosecution and the defence were in respect of the drug charges, the cheating and abetment of cheating charges, the abetment of false information charge and the enhanced sentences under s 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act. The prosecution and defence were largely aligned in terms of the traffic offences save with regard to the disqualification period.

### The drug charges (Failure to report for urine test and possession of methamphetamine)

61     For the 1st charge (failure to report for urine test), the prosecution submitted that the accused had failed to report for his urine test on a total of three occasions. In _PP v Ong Yiquan_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 275</span> (“_Ong Yiquan”)_ the court held that the benchmark sentence of six months’ imprisonment was appropriate for first-time offenders. The prosecution submitted that although the accused was a first-time offender with regard to an offence of failure to report for urine test, he was nonetheless traced for other drug offences. As such, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of six months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

62     The defence submitted that the accused was unable to present himself for urine testing as he was unemployed at the material time and did not have enough money to travel from his residence to the test centre. The defence relied on _PP v Azhar Bin Amin_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 43</span>, where the offender faced, _inter alia_, three FRUT charges and the court imposed a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for each charge. The defence accordingly submitted that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment was appropriate in the circumstances.

63     For the 7th charge (possession of methamphetamine), the prosecution referred to _PP v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 183</span> (“_Alvin Lim”_) where a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment was imposed for possession of 0.91 gram of cannabis mixture. Menon CJ observed that the sentencing range for a first offender who was charged with possession of a Class A controlled drug was a term of imprisonment of between six and 18 months. In contrast to _Alvin Lim_, the prosecution submitted that the drugs involved in this case was methamphetamine, which was more pernicious and lethal than the cannabis in _Alvin Lim_’s case.

64     Further, the accused in the present case was traced for drug offences, including having been convicted in 2018 for consumption of methamphetamine and sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment. Thus, a higher sentence than that imposed in _Alvin Lim_ was warranted as the offender in that case was untraced. The prosecution accordingly submitted that a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

65     The defence submitted that the amount of methamphetamine that the accused had in his possession was a very small amount, namely 0.41g. Additionally, he had not consumed it or otherwise benefited from the methamphetamine in his possession.

66     Relying on _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> (“_Dinesh Singh Bhatia_”) and _Alvin Lim_, the defence submitted for a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment.

### The cheating charges

67     The prosecution submitted that the sentences for the cheating offences should be calibrated based on the value of the property involved as it reflected the degree of harm and the criminal benefit to the accused (_Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span>). The prosecution highlighted the sentences meted out on the co-accused persons in the present case.

68     Yuzwan was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment for each s 420 Penal Code charge. The sums involved were $5,000 and $6,046. Although Yuzwan was traced, he did not have cheating related antecedents.

69     Rizwan was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment for the s 420 Penal Code charge. The sum involved was $6,918. Although Rizwan was traced, he did not have cheating-related antecedents.

70     Ridwan was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment for the s 420 Penal Code charge. The sum involved was $4,230. Ridwan was traced for dissimilar offences.

71     The prosecution submitted that an uplift for the sentences for the accused was warranted in light of the following aggravating factors.

72     The accused was traced for cheating offences. His previous conviction for cheating under s 420 Penal Code involved the _same exact modus operandi_ of renting cameras and their equipment from victims where he was previously sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment. Thus, a longer sentence would be necessary to achieve specific deterrence.

73     The accused played a greater role in the cheating offences than the co-accused persons. The co-accused persons merely collected the items from the victims. However, it was the accused who came up with the idea for the camera rental scam, initiated contact with the victims and thereafter, arranged for the co-accused persons to collect the items from the victims. It was even more egregious that it was the accused who introduced the co-accused persons to such scams because of his previous “successful” experience in committing them to obtain quick cash, for which he had been convicted and sentenced.

74     The prosecution highlighted that the accused had committed the cheating offences while he was on bail, namely the 4th, 6th, 22nd, 27th, 29th, 30th, 32nd and 35th charges.

75     The prosecution’s submission on the sentences for the cheating offences were as follows:

> a)     Seven months’ imprisonment for charges involving a quantum below $3,000;

> b)     Eight months’ imprisonment for charges involving a quantum below $4,000 but above $3,000; and

> c)     11 months’ imprisonment for charges involving a quantum above $6,000.

76     The defence submitted that the accused had difficulty making ends meet and was under tremendous financial pressure. Out of financial desperation and a lapse of judgment, he succumbed to the temptation of earning quick money by committing the cheating offences. Any financial benefit which he received from the offences was used to provide for the living expenses of himself and his son. The defence submitted that the harm caused by the accused to the victims would have been, to some extent, abated by the accused paying the rental price or deposit to the victims which amounted in total to $1,464 out of a total of $50,869.35 cheated on the proceeded charges.

77     With respect to the charges involved the co-accused, the defence submitted the 12th to 14th charges, namely Yuzwan (in the 12th charge) and Rizwan (in the 13th and 14th charges) were friends of the accused. When they discovered the accused’s involvement in the Section 420 cheating charges, they decided to use the same _modus operandi_ as the accused.

78     The defence relied on the cases of _PP v Jimmy Tan Teck Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 42</span> (“_Jimmy Tan_”), _PP v Lim Shi Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 108</span> (“_Lim Shi Hui_”) and _PP v Brenda Ng Lay Yen <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 256</span>_ (“_Brenda Ng_”) to justify the length of the imprisonment terms sought based on the amounts cheated. The defence submitted that the appropriate sentence involving sums of between $6,046 and $6,918 should be eight months’ imprisonment, for the charges involving sums of around $3,000, the appropriate sentence should be five months’ imprisonment, and for the charge involving the sum of $2,600, the appropriate sentence should be three months’ imprisonment.

### Abetment of false information charge

79     The prosecution submitted that a sentence of two months’ imprisonment should be imposed for abetment of false information charge so as to achieve parity with the co-accused Rizwan who was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment. The prosecution highlighted that there were two other similar charges involving Rizwan with regard to different victims that were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

80     The defence relied on _Koh Yong Chiah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 447</span> (“_Koh Yong Chiah_”) where the offender. a public servant, pleaded guilty to an offence under section 182 of the Penal Code, for falsely telling his cluster superintendent that he was not having an extra-marital affair with a school vendor while he held the position of principal of various schools. The High Court upheld the lower court’s sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment while noting that the false information provided by the accused person pertained to his public service work and his role as a senior public officer was an aggravating factor that was taken into account in sentencing.

81     While acknowledging that the accused faced two other similar charges taken into consideration, the defence submitted that the aggravating factors present in _Koh Yong Chiah_ was absent in the present case. The defence submitted that a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate.

### Enhanced sentences under s 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act

82     The prosecution submitted that the fresh offences that were the subject of the 14th and 12th charges would fall under Band 2 of the framework established in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 102</span> (_Abdul Mutalib_) where an enhanced sentence of half of the accused’s remaining duration of his remission order should be imposed. This would amount to 144 days and 96 days’ imprisonment for the 14th and 12th charges respectively.

83     The prosecution highlighted the following:

> a)     Gravity of fresh offence. The fresh offences committed were serious. The loss caused was substantial, with each charge involving over $6,000. The offences were also premeditated where the accused came up with the idea for the co-accused persons to engage in the camera rental scam, initiated communication with the victim and thereafter, arranged for the co-accused person to collect the purportedly rented items. For the 14th charge, the accused tried to conceal his offence by asking the co-accused person to lodge a false police report (the subject matter of the 19th charge). The gravity of the fresh offence was clear from the prosecution’s proposed sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment for each charge.

> b)     Low rehabilitative prospect: The accused’s rehabilitative prospect was low as evinced by his commission of the fresh offence shortly after he was released from prison. He committed the offences that were the subject of the 14th and 12th charges less than one month and four months into his remission period respectively. Further, not only was the fresh offence committed similar to the original offence, it involved an _identical modus operandi_ of pretending to rent cameras and its equipment and selling these items for personal profit.

84     The defence accepted that the enhanced sentence for the 14th and 12th charge fell under the moderate severity band of the _Abdul Mutalib_ framework and that there were not insignificant losses sustained by the victims. The defence accepted that the accused displayed low rehabilitative potential by re-offending within a month of his release on remission.

85     The defence submitted that the enhancement fell in the middle of Band 2 where the appropriate enhancement was about 40% of the relevant remission period. Applying the percentage to the respective remission periods involved in the 14th and 12th charges, the defence submitted that the appropriate enhanced sentence should be 114 days and 72 days respectively.

86     For the 1st charge (failure to report for urine test), the prosecution submitted that the 1st charge would fall under Band 1 in the Framework where an enhanced sentence of 1/3 of the accused’s remaining duration of his remission order should be imposed. However, as the aggregate enhanced sentence should not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order of 288 days, an enhanced sentence of 48 days’ imprisonment should thus be imposed (_Abdul Mutalib_ at \[75\]). This would result in the court imposing a total enhanced sentence of 288 days. Consequently, the accused’s entire remaining duration of his remission order at the time of his earliest offence would have been rescinded. There would thus be no need for the court to analyse the appropriate enhanced sentence to be imposed for the rest of the accused’s offences which involved remission periods.

87     The defence submitted that the offence of failure to report for urine test was of low severity, as the accused was a first-time offender for such an offence. Taking into consideration that the accused committed this offence after 5 months into his remission period, the defence submitted that the severity of the offence should be at the middle of Band 1 such that the appropriate enhancement was about 15% of the relevant remission period which amounted to 25 days’ imprisonment.

88     For the enhanced sentence for the abetment of false information, the defence submitted that the offence of providing false information to a public servant under section 182 of the Penal code was of low severity and that the severity falls in slightly below the mid-point of Band 1 such that the appropriate enhancement was about 5% of the relevant remission period. The defence submitted that the appropriate enhanced sentence would be 14 days’ imprisonment.

## The court’s decision on sentence

### Drug offences

89     In _Ong Yiquan_ the court held that that the benchmark sentence of six months’ imprisonment was appropriate for first-time offenders for offences involving the failure to report for urine test. In _Azhar bin Amin_ a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment was imposed. That said, there were trafficking and consumption charges for which long imprisonment terms were being imposed and accordingly a downward calibration of the FRUT charges was done on the totality principle. The District Judge in _Azhar bin Amin_ specifically alluded to this at \[75\]:

> **This was a sentence on the lower end of the range of sentences usually imposed on offences of this nature**. Despite the fact that the Accused had failed to turn up on 21 occasions for urine reporting, **I took into account that he had pleaded guilty and was already facing long imprisonment terms on the trafficking and consumption charges**..

> \[emphasis added\]

90     In the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (“SIRR”) the sentences imposed for failure to report for urine test offences (from 22 October 2001 to 4 April 2022) were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="30.18%"><col width="24.38%"><col width="21.08%"><col width="24.36%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Mean</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Median</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>25th Percentile</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>75th Percentile</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">26.3 weeks (6.0 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">21.4 weeks (4.9 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17.1 weeks (3.9 months)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30.0 weeks (6.9 months)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

91     The mean and median sentence was six and 4.9 months’ imprisonment respectively. Given that the accused also had two other similar charges (2nd and 3rd charge) taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, I was of the view that an imprisonment term of six months’ imprisonment which was the benchmark sentence (which was also the mean sentence for such offences) was appropriate.

92     As for the possession charge, in _Alvin Lim_ Menon CJ had observed at \[28\] that the sentencing range for a first offender who was charged with possession of a Class A controlled drug was a term of imprisonment of between six and 18 months. As stated in _Dinesh Singh_, the lower end of the range was typically for first time and/or young offenders. That could not be said to be the case for the accused who was neither a young offender (he was 28 years old at the time of the offences) nor was it is his first brush with the law with regard to drugs, having been convicted on 6 March 2018 for consumption of methamphetamine and sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment for it with other consumption and drug utensil charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Further, the accused had admitted that the methamphetamine which he had found to be in possession of was for his own consumption.

93     As such, I was of the view that sentence of 10 month’s imprisonment was appropriate for the possession of methamphetamine charge.

### The cheating charges

94     As a starting point, I accepted that the value of the property cheated was a relevant factor in calibrating the imprisonment term for cheating offences. In this regard, the defence referred to the cases of _Jimmy Tan, Lim Shi Hui_ and _Brenda Ng_ to justify their submission of the relevant imprisonment terms calibrated based on the amounts cheated_._

95     In _Jimmy Tan_, the offender was engaged in a scheme to stage motor vehicle accidents to cheat insurance companies. The amounts cheated included amounts of $7,000 and $7,900 for which he was sentenced to four and six months’ imprisonment respectively. He was untraced and was not the mastermind.

96     In _Lim Shi Hui_, the offender was involved in a number of cheating offence which cheated victim using social media platforms such as Carousell and Facebook, representing that she was selling products but did not provide the items after victims made payment, with amounts from $200 to $3,881. The total loss caused was $80,818.26. The offender was traced with a single antecedent for criminal breach of trust for which he was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. The court imposed a global sentence of 34 months’ and 2 weeks’ imprisonment for the cheating offences. The court had imposed sentences of three, four and five months’ imprisonment for amounts of $1,000, 2,000 and $3,000 cheated respectively.

97     In _Brenda Ng_, the offender represented to the victims that she was engaged in various investments when she knew it was false and induced the victims to deliver between $28,500 to $1,410,000. The total losses amounted to $6,609,473. Partial restitution (35% of the total amount) was made. The court imposed sentences of between eight to 68 months’ imprisonment per charge with a total sentence of 120 months’ imprisonment. The defence highlighted that the court in _Brenda Ng_ had imposed a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for an amount of $28,000 cheated.

98     In my view, the cases of _Jimmy Tan, Lim Shi Hui_ and _Brenda Ng_ could be distinguished from the present case on several grounds.

99     First, the principle of parity with the co-accused’s sentences. Second, the principle of specific deterrence and escalation in view of the accused’s similar antecedents. Third, the accused had committed the cheating offences while on bail. Fourth, for the abetment of cheating charges, the _modus operandi_ of the scam originated from the accused.

100    On the principle of parity, the co-accused persons were sentenced as follows:

> a)     Yuzwan was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment for each s 420 Penal Code charge. The sums involved were $5,000 and $6,046. Although Yuzwan was traced, he did not have cheating-related antecedents.

> b)     Rizwan was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment for the s 420 Penal Code charge. The sum involved was $6,918. Although Rizwan was traced, he did not have cheating-related antecedents.

> c)     Ridwan was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment for the s 420 Penal Code charge. The sum involved was $4,230. Rizwan was traced for dissimilar offences.

101    On the issue of specific deterrence and escalation, the accused was a repeat offender and was traced for a slew of property offences since 2013 ranging for dishonestly receiving stolen property, theft as a servant, theft from a dwelling house and cheating offences. Crucially he had committed cheating offences on 6 March 2018 using the _same modus operandi_ as in the present case where he was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment, namely pretending to rent photography equipment and thereafter selling the equipment on the Internet. This could be contrasted with _Jimmy Tan_ who was untraced, _Lim Shi Hui_ who had a single antecedent for criminal breach of trust and _Brenda Ng_ where there were no antecedents referred to by the court in the judgment.

102    The accused had committed the cheating offence while on bail. In _Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR 753</span>, V K Rajah JA observed at \[57\] that the commission of an offence whilst on bail for another, was itself an aggravating factor and “squarely and directly engages the two facets of deterrence.” In _Loo Pei Xiang Alan_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 217</span>, Chao JA observed at \[29\] that a good reason for elevating a sentence beyond its starting point was that the offences were committed while on bail which “demonstrates a disregard for law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention.”

103    On his role in the abetment of cheating charges, it was the co-accused persons who had approached the accused for ideas on how to raise money and the accused shared with them his modus operandi, and informed them that he had been successful in raising money through this manner in the past. As Yuzwan was unfamiliar with Carousell, the accused taught him how to create an account on the platform and used Yuzwan’s account to contact potential victims and would ask Yuzwan to meet up with the victims to collect the cameras. In the case of Rizwan, the accused had informed Rizwan to lodge a false police report after selling the items to state that he had lost the cameras so that the camera’s owner does not suspect that he was a scammer.

104    As such I was of the view that on the principle of escalation, there was a need to increase the sentence (calibrated based on the value of the property) to specific deter the accused. As noted by Menon CJ in _Low Qi Jing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 174</span> at \[62\]:

> In considering the offender’s antecedents and the index offence, the court is inquiring into whether a cycle of offending exists, and if so, what has been the trend of offending behaviour. **An escalation of sentences may be warranted where the offender’s antecedents disclose a “cavalier disregard for the law”:** _Tan Kay Beng_ (\[56\] _supra_) at \[16\]; or as the Malaysian High Court put the point in _Soosainathan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 MLJ 377</span> at 385D, where the offender’s prior criminality “demonstrate\[s\] that the current offence is no passing lapse, but evidence of a real unwillingness … to comply with the law.

> \[emphasis added\]

105    Regrettably, the accused’s previous stint in prison for the same cheating offence had not deterred him and he had committed the present cheating and abetment of cheating offences using the same _modus operandi_. As such, I used the sentences of the co-accused as a starting point, applied the principle of escalation and specific deterrence at the same time calibrating the sentences based on the value of the property on the basis of proportionality. In the circumstances, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission in this regard and applied the following sentences for the cheating offences:

> a)     Seven months’ imprisonment for charges involving a quantum below $3,000;

> b)     Eight months’ imprisonment for charges involving a quantum from $3,000 to 6,000 and

> c)     Eleven months’ imprisonment for charges involving a quantum above $6,000.

### Abetment of false information

106    As the defence’s reliance on the sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment in _Koh Yong Chiah_ as a guide for the charge of abetment of false information, in my view that involved an entirely different factual matrix from the present case where the court found at \[62\] while the custodial threshold had been crossed, there was no finding of actual corruption or misuse of public funds.

107    In the present case, the accused had committed the offence together with Rizwan. The accused told Rizwan to lodge a false police report stating that the rented items from Phua had been lost after selling the items so that Phua would not suspect that he was a scammer. Rizwan proceeded to lodge police report where he claimed that he had misplaced the items in a taxi. The false information provided was intended to cause SSG Khairul to omit investigating or prosecuting Rizwan for the cheating offence.

108    On the issue of parity of sentence with a co-accused person, in _PP v Ramlee_ \[1998\] 3 SLR (R) 95 Yong CJ stated at \[7\]:

> Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances … An offender who has received a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of appeal if the disparity is serious. This is even where the sentences viewed in isolation are not considered manifestly excessive: see _R v Walsh_ (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 224. In _R v Fawcett_ (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 158, Lawton LJ held that the test was whether ‘right thinking members of the public, with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, learning of this sentence consider that something had gone wrong with the administration of justice?

109    Rizwan was sentenced to two month’s imprisonment for the offence of providing false information to SSG Khairul. If anything, the accused was more culpable than Rizwan as he was the one who told Rizwan to lodge the police report. Further, this was not stand alone offence and there were two other similar charges (20th and 21st charges) which were committed on different dates several months later which were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing which involved two other victims.

110    All things considered, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission of two months’ imprisonment on the principle of parity with the co-accused Rizwan and I imposed a sentence of two months’ imprisonment.

### Road traffic offences

111    For the 41st Charge under s 65(1)(b) p/u s 65(5)(a) RTA, the case of _PP v Cullen Richard Alexander_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 88</span> (“_Cullen Richard Alexander_”) was instructive. The court in _Cullen Richard Alexander_ had observed that due to the increase in the prescribed punishment from $1,000 to $1,500 for the maximum fine under the new provision, a slight uplift from the previous range was necessary. The offender had driven a motor pick-upon a road without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road by failing to keep a proper lookout ahead and colliding into the rear of motorcar. The court in _Cullen Richard Alexander_ imposed a $1,000 fine and three months’ disqualification.

112    I agreed with both parties’ submission that a $1,000 fine and 3 months’ disqualification was appropriate in the circumstances.

113    For the 42nd Charge under s 84(1) r/w Section 84(7) p/u s 131(2)(a) RTA, the court in _Cullen Richard Alexander_ held that $600 was the usual fine imposed on a first offender for such an offence and I agreed with both parties’ submission that a $600 fine was appropriate.

114    For the 49th Charge under s 122 RTA, I imposed a $600 fine, which was slightly lower than the $800 fine imposed in _PP v Tan Kheng Leong Jason_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 307</span> where the facts were slightly more aggravated than the present case, where the offender had left his vehicle stationary to confront another driver with no hazard lights switched on even though there were other vehicles travelling along the road.

115    For the 48th Charge under s 3(2) r/w s 3(1) and s 3(3) of Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act, I imposed a $600 fine with 12 months’ disqualification from the date of the conviction which was within the usual range of fines for such offences, see _PP v Sarinder Kaur d/o Kulip Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 229</span>.

116    For the 47thcharge under s 35(1) p/u Section 35(3)(a) RTA, Parliament had amended s 35 RTA in 2019 resulting in a substantial increase in the maximum sentence for an offence under s 35(1) of the RTA as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="7.86%"><col width="15.08%"><col width="27.68%"><col width="49.38%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/N</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Type of offender</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Pre-amendment</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Post-amendment</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>s 35(1) p/u s 131(2)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>s 35(3)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">First offender</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 3 months or to both.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine up to $10,000 or imprisonment up to 3 years or to both;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Repeat offender</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine up to $2,000 or imprisonment up to 6 months or to both.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine up to $20,000 or imprisonment up to 6 years or to both.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

117    I agreed with the prosecution that the sentencing norms would need to be adapted in order to reflect the substantial increase in the maximum sentence post amendment.

118    The defence agreed with the prosecution’s submission for a $6,000 fine for the 47th charge but submitted for disqualification period of 12 months to take place with effect from the date of conviction. In my view, in view of the enhanced maximum sentence for s 35(1) RTA offences thus reflecting Parliament’s intention for stiffer sentences to be imposed for such offences, the period of disqualification should similarly be adjusted upwards and I accordingly imposed a two year disqualification period. Further, there was no reason for me to depart from the general rule that a disqualification should take effect from the date of release from prison, see _Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 37</span> at \[39\] and I so ordered.

### Consecutive sentences

119    Both the prosecution and defence agreed that the imprisonment terms in the 7th, 12th, 14th, 22nd and 30th charges should run consecutively given the nature and gravity of the offences, as they formed different and distinct transactions such that the sentences sufficiently encompass the principle of deterrence and the relevant legal interests are protected. I agreed and ordered the imprisonment terms for the 7th, 12th, 14th, 22nd and 30th charges to run consecutively as they did not involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest and would not breach the one transaction rule.

### Enhanced sentences under s 50T Prisons Act

120    In _Abdul Mutalib_ the court provided the following sentencing framework for enhanced sentences under s 50T PA:

121    In _Abdul Mutalib_ the court held that as a practical matter, the court should determine the appropriate enhanced sentence to impose (if any) in order of the most serious to the least serious of the fresh offences, stopping once the whole of the remaining duration of the remission order at the time the offender’s earliest offence has been rescinded. In order not to exceed the remaining duration of the offender’s remission order at the time of his earliest offence (which was the outer limit to the cumulative sentence that may be imposed under ss 50T and 50Y), the court may have to make adjustments to the individual sentences (whether imposed under s 50T or under s 50Y) and/or may decide not to impose any enhanced sentence for one or more of the fresh offences

122    In the present case, both the prosecution and defence agreed that the enhanced sentences for the 14th and 12th charges fell within Band 2, namely the moderate level of severity but the parties differed as to which part of Band 2 the fresh offences fell. In this regard, I agreed with the prosecution that the fresh offences were serious as they were similar to the offences for which the remission order had been made and the accused’s rehabilitative prospect was low as evinced by his commission of the fresh offence shortly after he was released from prison were committed less than one month and four months into the remission period. Accordingly, I agreed with the prosecution that the enhanced sentence be approximately half of the remission period which would be 144 days for the 14th charge and 96 days for the 12 charges

123    For the failure to report for urine offence, I agreed that it was dissimilar to the offences for which the remission order and would accordingly be placed in Band 1, namely 1/3 of the remaining period, which would amount to 48 days’ imprisonment. This would reach 288 days which is the outer limit without even considering the other offences where s 50T applied.

124    In any event, given that he faced a total of 11 charges under 50T of the Prisons Act proceeded with, even if I had adopted the defence’s submission for a lower period for the enhanced sentences for the 14th, 12th and the failure to report for urine charge, I was of the view that the 288 days would inevitably had been reached in any event as a result of imposition of enhanced sentences for the remaining eight charges under s 50T of the Prisons Act.

125    In conclusion, the sentences I imposed are as follows:

### Global sentence

126    In arriving at the global sentence for the accused, I took a “last look” to ensure that the global sentence was justified on the facts and circumstances of the case.

127    In this regard, I took into the account the following factors:

> a)     Multiple victims were involved. For his cheating offences alone, there were 29 victims.

> b)     The total loss caused by the accused’s cheating offences in the present case was $124,434.35.

> c)     The duration of offending took place over a period of 10 months. The offences were committed by the accused from 16 May 2019 to 5 March 2020. The cheating offences were also committed while on bail.

> d)     The use of the Internet to commit the scam. The victims scammed by the accused and the co-accused persons were done through the use of online platforms such as Carousell and MyRent with various account names which enabled them to source for multiple victims. In _PP v Syamsul Hilal bin Ismail_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 973</span>, the court held that there was a public interest element to deter like-minded offenders from using the internet to prey on potential victims.

> e)     The number of charges taken into consideration: 31 similar charges are taken into consideration for sentencing.

128    Further, I did not agree with the defence that the global sentence should be no higher than that in _Lim Shi Hui_ where a global sentence of 34 months’ and 2 weeks’ imprisonment was imposed where the total loss caused was $80,818.26. In the present case, the total loss caused by the accused’s cheating offences was $124,434.35, significantly higher than that in _Lim Shi Hui_.

129    In my view, the sentence of 54 months’ imprisonment did not breach the totality principle having regard to the overall criminality of the accused. The accused was a repeat offender for property offences and similar cheating offences who had cheated multiple victims. The sentence was also not a crushing one having regard to his age as he was presently 28 years old.

## Backdating of sentence

130    As the accused had committed fresh offences while on bail, his bail was revoked and a warrant of arrest (with no bail) was issued against him for failure to attend court on 26 February 2020.

131    The warrant of arrest was executed on 9 March 2020 and the accused had been in custody since then. I accordingly backdated the imprisonment terms to 9 March 2020, pursuant to section 318(5) CPC. Both prosecution and defence agreed with this.

132    The accused is currently serving sentence.
