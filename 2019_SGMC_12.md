11     Both the accused, have filed an appeal against their convictions, sentences and compensation orders. They are currently on bail pending appeal.

## The Undisputed Facts

12     The victim, Phyu Phyu Mar, is a 25 year-old Myanmar national. She was employed by Seah as a domestic maid from February 2016 to October 2016. Seah is a beauty salon manager at Anew Me Beauty Aesthetic in Centrepoint, whilst Lim is an interior designer. Phyu Phyu Mar’s role was to take care of the couple’s 5 year-old daughter as well as accompany Seah to her beauty salon a few times a week.

13     A first information report was made on 14 October 2016 at 10.43pm by PW1 Lee Lee Yen (“Lynette”), an employee at Seah’s beauty salon, who called ‘999’ to report a case of maid abuse concerning the victim:

_“I would like to give information maid abuse. She is a Myanmar maid. Previously she was scalded with hot water and the in-charge case is Mr Ho Shaolun. But I do not know his number. The abuse happen again. Today, I saw she has bruises on her eyes and she also complained to me that the employer did not gave her food for the past three days. Please update this to the in-charge case.”_

14     Two police officers were despatched that night to the flat to interview Seah and the victim. The next day on 15 October 2016, Insp Shaun Leong and Stella Tay brought the victim to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital for a medical check-up. Photographs of the victim’s injuries were taken in the hospital.

15     It is not in dispute that the victim suffered injuries as a result of hot water being poured on her and continues to bear scald marks on her body. The victim’s injuries can be observed from the photographs exhibited at P2 and the victim’s medical report[^1] noted the injuries suffered by the victim:

a.     Haematoma, left orbital region

b.     Haematoma, left frontal region (~3 cm)

c.     Scald marks, left upper back and flank

d.     Haematoma, left hand

e.     Swelling, left metacarpophalangeal joints

16     The victim was warded in hospital from 15 to 21 October 2016 and given 14 days’ hospitalisation leave from 15 to 28 October 2016.

17     IO Kenneth Koh recorded a statement from Lim on 18 April 2017 at 2.20pm and this was admitted into evidence as P8.

## Summary of the Prosecution’s Case

## MCN 901530-2017 - Punching Phyu Phyu Mar twice

18     Phyu Phyu Mar testified that on 13 October 2016, Lim punched her twice on the forehead in quick succession, causing her pain.[^2] Although Phyu Phyu Mar was unable to recall the exact time it happened, she said that it took place sometime in the evening after the third occasion when Seah had hit her with the phone.[^3] The incident took place inside the flat near the iron gate of the flat’s entrance and caused her to suffer pain. Lim had punched her because he thought that she had thrown away his spectacles when she did not do so.[^4]

## MAC 906780-2017 – Late August instigating victim to knock head on floor

19     Phyu Phyu Mar testified that from late August 2016, Seah’s attitude towards her was not too good and Seah was not happy with her.[^5] Seah was not happy with Phyu Phyu Mar and had asked her to hit her head on the floor in late August 2016, stating that this was the maid agency’s instructions.[^6] Phyu Phyu Mar therefore knelt on the floor in the kitchen to hit her head whilst Seah sat in the living room. She was told to hit her head until Seah could hear the sound of her head hitting the floor.[^7] Phyu Phyu Mar complied and hit her forehead on the floor multiple times, causing her head to be very painful and to bleed a little.[^8]

## MAC 906778-2018 – Late August instigating victim to pour hot water on left shoulder

20     Phyu Phyu Mar testified that Seah had boiled water in an electric kettle, poured the water into a cup till it was more than half full in late August 2016. Phyu Phyu Mar was asked to pour the hot water on herself,[^9] causing her skin to become red and very painful such that she was unable to sleep that night.

## MAC 906779-2017 – Late September instigating victim to pour hot water on left shoulder twice

21     Phyu Phyu Mar testified that in late September 2016 Seah would watch Phyu Phyu Mar via the CCTV installed in the flat to observe her complete her chores. However, as Phyu Phyu Mar was slow to finish the chores, this meant that Seah was unable to sleep and this made Seah angry.

22     When Phyu Phyu Mar was boiling water in the kitchen, Seah told her to pour a cup of hot water on her body. Seah poured the hot water into a cup and threatened Phyu Phyu Mar by saying: “If you don’t pour on yourself, I will pour hot water (on myself). Then I will call the police, tell the police you pour hot water on me. Then police arrest you and you will not see your parents again.”[^10]

23     This made Phyu Phyu Mar afraid that she would be jailed and be unable to see her parents again, thus she proceeded to pour the hot water in the cup she was holding in her right hand onto her left shoulder. Seah was standing in front of Phyu Phyu Mar at that time and found that too much water had fallen on the floor instead of on Phyu Phyu Mar’s shoulder. Seah refilled the cup till it was full and asked Phyu Phyu Mar to pour it on herself a second time.[^11] Phyu Phyu asked if she could pour it on the other shoulder instead but Seah insisted that she pour it on the same left shoulder which Phyu Phyu Mar complied with. She described it as being “very very painful” and caused her to shout in pain. Her skin subsequently became very red, blistered and had scald marks.[^12]

24     However, instead of seeking medical attention for Phyu Phyu Mar, Seah only passed her a needle to puncture the blisters herself. Phyu Phyu Mar was too afraid to ask Seah if she could see a doctor. She testified to feeling “pain” when she used the needle to puncture the blisters.[^13] She also wished to go home so that someone could give her medicine and take care of her.

25     Phyu Phyu Mar subsequently informed PW1 Lynette of her injuries caused by the hot water and sought Lynette’s help to speak with Seah.

## MAC 910505-2017 – Causing victim to take water adulterated with floor cleaner

26     Immediately after the pouring of the hot water, Seah proceeded to ask Phyu Phyu Mar to clean the wet floor.[^14] Phyu Phyu Mar cleaned the floor with a towel. She filled a pail with water and poured a capful of floor detergent into the water to clean the kitchen floor and living room. Seah scooped up a cup of water from the pail and asked her to drink the dirty water, which was black and contained dog hairs. Phyu Phyu Mar testified that Seah looked angry, thus she drank all the water in the cup which tasted very bitter.[^15] This caused Phyu Phyu Mar to vomit and her stomach was not well for the next few days.

## MAC 906781-2017 – Grabbing her by her hair and shaking her until quite a lot of her hair fell out

27     On the same day, Seah told Phyu Phyu Mar that she would not report her to the agency and would not go to the police anymore. Phyu Phyu Mar asked “Really?”[^16] which caused Seah to get angry again. This time, Seah grabbed her hair on the right side of her head and pulled it downwards a number of times, causing her head to hurt and quite a lot of her hair to fall out.[^17] The incident occurred near the toilet.

## MAC 906782-2017 – Hitting multiple times with mobile phone

28     Phyu Phyu Mar testified that she was hit on three occasions on 13 October 2016 by a pink iPhone.[^18] The first occurred in the morning in the flat near the entrance of the main door. Seah felt that Phyu Phyu Mar was working very slowly and because Seah needed to observe her work, this caused Seah to have insufficient sleep which was bad for her health.[^19] Seah hit Phyu Phyu multiple times all over her forehead with the corner of the phone. Phyu Phyu Mar felt pain on her head but did not react because she was afraid of Seah.[^20]

29     The second occasion took place in the afternoon in the kitchen. Phyu Phyu Mar did not know which part of the mobile phone Seah had used on her because she had bent her head whilst being hit with the mobile phone. Seah had hit her forehead and all over the back of her head and this was very painful.[^21]

30     The third occasion took place in the toilet towards the evening or night when Seah used the phone to hit Phyu Phyu Mar all over her head. This time, Phyu Phyu Mar protected her eyes with her hands and blocked the blows.[^22] Seah hit Phyu Phyu Mar around her left eye area and some of the blows landed on her eye and face.[^23] As a result, Phyu Phyu Mar was hit around her left eye. Phyu Phyu Mar testified that it was very painful.[^24]

31     Phyu Phyu Mar also testified that she was not given enough food, sometimes she was only fed with biscuits, and sometimes she had noodles which were not cooked, i.e. dipped in cold water.[^25] As a result, her weight when she was at the hospital was only 38 kilograms, compared to 50 kilograms in February 2016.

## Evidence of PW1 Lee Lee Yen (“Lynette”)

32     Lynette worked as a nutritionist in Seah’s beauty salon from December 2015 to October 2016, although she had known and had worked with Seah since 2009. She described her relationship with Seah as good. Lynette testified that Seah would sometimes bring her daughter to the salon. Phyu Phyu Mar would take care of the daughter and also help with the cleaning.

33     Lynette described Phyu Phyu Mar as initially being quite chatty, having long hair and looking a bit chubby.[^26] However in August or September 2016, Lynette noticed that Phyu Phyu Mar had slimmed down and she did not see her eating meals in the shop so often. Phyu Phyu Mar told Lynette that she had no food to eat and was hungry, so Lynette would secretly give her biscuits and drinks.[^27]

34     In mid-October 2016, Lynette observed that Phyu Phyu Mar had a swollen left eye, and when Phyu Phyu Mar was in the shop folding towels, she showed Lynette her left shoulder injury which was very red with the skin starting to peel off. Lynette testified that Phyu Phyu Mar had told her that Seah “used hot water to pour it on her back and \[Seah\] also asked her to pour the hot water onto herself”.[^28]

35     Lynette asked if Phyu Phyu Mar needed any assistance and Phyu Phyu Mar replied that she hoped that Lynette could talk to Seah so that she could continue to work for Seah and for Seah not to treat her that way anymore.[^29] Lynette explained that she knew it was a hot water scalding mark because in mid-September, her colleague Maggie told her that Phyu Phyu Mar had been scalded by hot water. During that period, Seah had asked Phyu Phyu not to talk to or have contact with the workers in the salon.[^30] Lynette decided to make a police report and called ‘999’ that evening on 14 October 2016.

## Evidence of PW2 Muhammad Gharib Bin Sani

36     PW2 was one of the police officer who attended at the house on 14 October 2018. He testified that when the maid was called to come out, she was not wearing a jacket at first but later returned back in to put on a jacket.[^31] PW2 interviewed Seah whilst his colleague interviewed Phyu Phyu Mar. PW2 observed that Phyu Phyu Mar had an injury on her eye and told him initially that she was being abused by Seah using the handphone, but upon further probing, became intimidated and inconsistent.[^32]

## Evidence of PW3 Shem Leow

37     PW3 was the other police officer who attended at the house on 14 October 2016. He testified that when he asked for Phyu Phyu Mar to come out, she came out wearing a jacket and he proceeded to interview her. He observed that Phyu Phyu Mar was nervous and had an injury to her left eye and the side of her body.

## Evidence of PW5 Shaun Leong

38     Inspector Shaun Leong visited the house on 15 October 2016 with his female colleague IO Stella and asked for Phyu Phyu Mar to be brought out. He testified that Seah had closed the door for about 5 minutes before Phyu Phyu Mar came out. They brought her to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital for a medical examination. He testified that they noticed Phyu Phyu Mar fidgeting with her fringe whilst in the waiting area of the hospital and when his colleague lifted her fringe, they saw extensive bruising on her forehead. Phyu Phyu Mar was initially reluctant to share what had happened but later teared up and said that Seah had hit her on the forehead with her mobile phone.[^33] Phyu Phyu Mar also shared that the scald marks were caused by Seah forcing her to pour boiling water on herself on two separate occasions.

## Evidence of PW7 Stella Tay

39     PW7 visited the house on 15 October together with IO Shaun Leong and confirmed that they waited 5 to 8 minutes before Phyu Phyu Mar was brought out to them. At the hospital, when PW7 touched Phyu Phyu Mar’s shoulder, she shrugged her shoulder away and PW7 noticed a patch of burn marks which looked quite fresh. Phyu Phyu Mar was observed to be crying and looking down and also told PW7 that “she poured hot water”, which PW7 assumed to be Seah pouring hot water on Phyu Phyu Mar.[^34]

## Evidence of PW8 Dr Teo Ting Zhang

40     Dr Teo was the medical officer who attended to Phyu Phyu Mar at the hospital for about 30 to 45 minutes. He testified that she appeared frightful. Dr Teo took a history of injuries from the victim and recorded that she was “coerced to scald herself”.[^35] He opined that her haematoma was likely to have been caused by a blunt force trauma.[^36] Dr Teo also noted that she was undernourished with wasting over the left temporal region.

## Summary of the Defence’s Case

## MCN 901530-2017 - Punching Phyu Phyu Mar twice

41     Lim’s evidence was one of bare denial. He testified that no such incident took place and that he had never punched the victim.[^37] Further, there was no objective medical evidence to prove that she had suffered injuries caused by his alleged act. Counsel also contended that Phyu Phyu Mar did not mention Lim’s assault to the prosecution witnesses until much later during the investigations.

## MAC 906780-2017 – Late August instigating victim to knock head on floor

42     Seah alleged that Phyu Phyu Mar had, on her own accord and without any instigation by Seah, knocked her head on the ground. This was because Phyu Phyu Mar’s attitude towards her work started to slacken in June, and Seah had called the maid agent Kevin in August 2016 to complain about the victim. Upon overhearing the conversation and knowing that Seah intended to replace her, Phyu Phyu Mar became dramatic, knelt down and knocked her head on the floor to plead with Seah not to send her back.[^38] Seah denies that the victim’s forehead had bled and said that there was no wound when she checked.

## MAC 906778-2018 – Late August instigating victim to pour hot water on left shoulder

43     Seah’s defence was one of bare denial – that this incident did not take place.

## MAC 906779-2017 – Late September instigating victim to pour hot water on left shoulder twice

44     Seah’s defence is that Phyu Phyu Mar only poured one cup of water on herself without Seah’s instigation. Her evidence was that this took place around 11pm to 12am at night. Seah had been preparing some food to eat and Phyu Phyu Mar walked over and wanted to speak to her, which Seah refused. Phyu Phyu Mar then stood in front of her saying she would rather die than go back to the agent company. She proceeded to pour the water on herself, shouted and ran to the bathroom locking the door.

45     When Phyu Phyu Mar came out after one to two minutes, Seah asked her why she had poured hot water on herself and wanted to call the police. However, upon hearing the same, Phyu Phyu Mar pleaded with Seah not to send her back.

46     Seah then checked on Phyu Phyu’s injuries and wanted to send her to the hospital but Phyu Phyu became agitated and said she could not go to the hospital because her passport was fake (in the sense that she had overdeclared her age in order to work in Singapore).

47     Lim had also testified that whilst he did not witness the water-pouring incident, he had seen Phyu Phyu Mar run to the bathroom. Lim also said that he had told Phyu Phyu Mar that it was a dangerous act for her to pour water on herself and that when he suggested sending her to hospital, Phyu Phyu Mar became agitated and begged him not to.[^39] Lim said that this took place around 12am to 1am and that although he wanted to bring the maid to see a doctor, Phyu Phyu Mar said she would be alright after a rest. Lim told her he would get her some cream for her burns the next day.

## MAC 910505-2017 – Causing victim to take water adulterated with floor cleaner

48     Seah testified that she saw that Phyu Phyu Mar wanted to drink the dirty water. Phyu Phyu Mar was mopping the floor and when she asked Seah if she required her to prepare anything. Seah said there was no need to and she could do it herself. Phyu Phyu Mar then became emotional and said that Seah had promised her that she could work till 31 October 2016. Seah testified that Phyu Phyu Mar had not changed the water when she mopped a new area in the home and therefore confronted Phyu Phyu Mar, who in turn asked not to return to her home country. Whilst Seah was talking, Phyu Phyu Mar took her cup, squatted down and put her cup into the pail of water. Seah quickly grabbed the cup away and asked why she wanted to drink the dirty water. Seah then took the pail of water to the toilet to pour away.

## MAC 906781-2017 – Grabbing her by her hair and shaking her until quite a lot of her hair fell out

49     Seah denied that such incident took place in late September 2016. Instead, Phyu Phyu Mar had pulled her own hair on 14 October 2016, after the two police officers had left the home because she was at a loss over what to do and was worried she would go to jail.

## MAC 906782-2017 – Hitting multiple times with mobile phone

50     Seah testified that she did not hit Phyu Phyu Mar multiple times with her handphone. It was Phyu Phyu Mar who had inflicted the injuries on herself in three incidents. First, she hit herself on the forehead and eye for a couple of times in the morning at around 8am to 9am using an iPhone 4 that was left on the dining table[^40]. Seah then told Phyu Phyu Mar that she had decided to send Phyu Phyu Mar back and would make the necessary arrangements. After Seah returned to her room, she heard a loud bang and both Seah and Lim came out of the room to see what had happened. They saw Phyu Phyu Mar at the balcony door. She said that she had accidentally fallen whilst cleaning the balcony and her left eye looked unnatural and/or her head had a bump.

51     Seah also gave evidence that Phyu Phyu Mar wanted to take a loan of $5,000 from Seah because her family was suffering from financial difficulties.[^41] Seah however preferred to send the money directly to the family and asked the maid for her home address. Seah made queries with DW4 Ng Kae How and found that it was not the home address of Phyu Phyu Mar’s parents. She confronted Phyu Phyu Mar who became agitated and starting hitting herself on her forehead with the handphone.

## The Ancillary Hearing

52     Seah challenged the voluntariness of her statement recorded by the investigation officer Shaun Leong (“IO Shaun”) recorded on 13 February 2017 at 2.28pm which prosecution intended to adduce for the purposes of impeachment. After an ancillary hearing, I found that the statement was given voluntarily and admitted them into evidence. The defence alleged that threats to Seah had been made by the IO such as:

a.     Asking Seah to PG to get a lighter sentence

b.     Getting people outside to handle Seah

c.     Asking IO Stella to come over to show that Seah was lying

d.     Not being allowed to use her mobile phone

e.     Telling accused’s lawyer “see what you can do”

53     IO Shaun took the stand for the prosecution whilst Ms Kasturibai Manickam, who had represented Seah in this trial until 20 June 2018 gave evidence for the defence together with Seah.

54     On the first allegation, IO Shaun Leong testified that he did not ask the accused to plead guilty before or during the recording of the statement. The accused had not been charged at the time of the statement recording. It did not appear logical that the IO would make such a statement as alleged. The acronym “PG” is not something commonly known to laypersons and moreover, the IO would not have the power to decide on the sentence or the charge. In Ms Manickam’s letter on 14 February 2017[^42], I note that there was no mention of such a phrase being uttered. Instead, it was alleged that the accused was under duress when asked to “admit to her so-called wrongdoing”. This differs from the ancillary hearing where Seah consistently maintained that the IO had told her she had better “PG” to get a lighter sentence and not waste time lying.[^43] Even if such a phrase had been uttered by the IO, this was a general statement that could not reasonably be inferred as an inducement which operated on Seah’s mind and affected the voluntariness of the statement without more.

55     On the allegation that IO Shaun threatened to get people outside to handle her, the IO did not understand what the phrase meant.[^44] Given that the statement was being recorded in an open concept office, it was unlikely that an IO would make such a threat. In fact, IO Shaun clarified that he was willing to accede to her request but it was his supervisor who turned down her request.[^45] In any event, it appeared that this was in the context of the accused not being able to download the contacts in her handphone and was not in any way connected with the recording of the statement.[^46] In fact, it is also telling that Ms Manickam’s letter alleging that the IO had threatened to harass her at her business premises or home[^47] was not in Seah’s evidence at all during the ancillary hearing.

56     As for asking IO Stella to come over to prove that Seah had been lying, IO Shaun could not recall if IO Stella was even present in office that day. Prosecution had offered IO Stella to the defence as a witness, however after defence counsel spoke to IO Stella, the defence declined to call her as a witness. I also note that Ms Manickam’s letter had in fact emphasised that “there were no female officers present” during the statement recording, which directly contradicts Seah’s allegation.

57     It is not disputed that Seah was asked to hand over her handphone towards the end of the statement recording and that Seah was allowed to make phone calls before handing it over. Seah however claimed that she was not allowed to check her phone to help her recall when certain incidents may have occurred. Whilst it may have been possible that the accused was not allowed to check her phone to recall the dates, I am not satisfied that this amounted to any duress or oppression which operated on her mind which affected the voluntariness of her statement. In any event, I note that the accused was able to see messages from her lawyer and make a call to her lawyer as well as to the person with whom she arranged to come download her phone.

58     In respect of the allegation “see what your lawyer can do”, the accused claimed that she had contacted her lawyer during the statement recording after seeing a message from her lawyer and this had been said by the IO to Ms Manickam. Ms Manickam’s testimony was limited because she could only confirm that she had purportedly heard the phrase “see what your lawyer can do”. Ms Manickam was unable to reveal the context of the conversation on the basis of legal privilege. With no context or explanation as to how this phrase could have come about, I found her evidence was of little utility and little weight should be placed on it. I was more inclined to accept IO Shaun’s evidence that such a statement was not uttered because first, he did not even know that the accused was speaking with her lawyer and secondly, no such allegation was raised in Ms Manickam’s letter. Even if such a statement had indeed been uttered, I was satisfied that this did not amount to any threat which operated on the accused’s mind. This was because the accused was able to effect an amendment in her statement[^48] to say that she would not be willing to undergo a polygraph test until she had spoken to her lawyer.

59     Counsel also took issue with the accuracy of the statement, i.e. that the statement contained missing words, using “my pay” instead of “her pay”. IO Shaun took the stand and explained that these were answers that were recorded verbatim. It would not have been proper for the IO to correct or rephrase the accused’s answers even if they were grammatically incorrect. Considering that Seah was more comfortable giving evidence through a Mandarin interpreter, it was not surprising that her answers as taken down verbatim would contain missing words, or incorrect usage of pronouns.

60     Overall, having observed the demeanour of the witnesses and having reviewed the evidence, I found the IO to be the more consistent and credible witness and accepted his evidence in the ancillary hearing. I noted that Seah had the opportunity to read the statement, understand the nature and make amendments (which she in fact did), which indicated that the recording officer had complied with the procedural requirements in recording the statement. If Seah indeed had other amendments, these were not informed orally to IO at that time or any time after.

## Credibility of the Witnesses

61     The Prosecution’s case rests primarily on the evidence of the victim Phyu Phyu Mar. In assessing the credibility of the victim, I would have to take into account her demeanour along with the internal and external consistencies found in the victim’s testimony and also assess her testimony against that of the accused persons.

62     The defence submitted that Phyu Phyu Mar’s testimony was not unusually convincing as she was “staring down as she gave her version of events and the long pauses between her answers were also obvious” and that her answers lacked clarity and coherence.

63     On the contrary, I found the victim to be generally clear and consistent in her testimony. Although she appeared timid and quiet, she was able to give a reply where she could recall what had happened. And if she was unable to recollect the same, for example as to how an incident arose, she was also unafraid to reply that she was unable to recall rather than attempt to embellish her evidence. Human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is both common and understandable. Given the trauma experienced by Phyu Phyu Mar, it was understandable if there were aspects of the incidents that she could not recall or if there may have been inconsistencies.

64     Whilst Phyu Phyu Mar may have paused occasionally before replying, these were few and far between and was nothing out of the ordinary as the events had occurred more than a year and a half ago. It was understandable that she would have needed time to recollect the events and to also process the questions that had been translated into Myanmar language to her. In fact, the interpreter had highlighted during the trial that Phyu Phyu Mar was from the Chin ethnic group in Myanmar and therefore was not as eloquent in the Myanmar language, and had difficulties articulating what she had suffered. As for the allegation of staring down when giving her evidence, I observed that Phyu Phyu Mar looked distressed on occasions when recounting the acts inflicted on her. It would not be surprising if she wished to avoid eye contact with the accused persons or their counsel when giving her testimony because of the psychological impact of the acts done against her.

65     I did not find Phyu Phyu Mar to be evasive or materially inconsistent. Her evidence was largely corroborated by that of the other witnesses whom she had related the incidents to – Lynette, the police officers who had brought her to the hospital and the doctors at the hospital.

66     Phyu Phyu Mar was candid in explaining some of the inconsistencies between her evidence and what the other prosecution witnesses had testified that she had told them.

a.     Phyu Phyu Mar admitted she did not tell Lynette every single thing that had happened. This was possible because the periods in which Lynette and Phyu Phyu Mar was able to speak without Seah’s knowledge would be limited and Lynette may have misunderstood what had happened in terms of how the scalding incident had happened.

b.     Phyu Phyu Mar testified that she had been instructed by Seah to lie to the two policemen who visited on 14 October 2016 to avoid being sent back home and was very nervous and intimidated by the police who were in uniform as well as Seah who was nearby.

c.     Phyu Phyu Mar also admitted that she did not tell Dr Teo everything that had happened. This is also supported by the fact that Dr Teo testified that he communicated with the victim using gestures and basic English to obtain a certain degree of history.

67     I found the victim’s account of how her various injuries were sustained to be externally consistent with objective evidence such as the photographs and the medical report.

68     In contrast, I found that Lim came across as evasive and defensive when giving his evidence. When asked about Seah’s supervision on the victim’s household chores, Lim tried asking the prosecution questions instead in order to deflect the posed question.

69     Lim claimed in his testimony to have witnessed the aftermath of the hot water-pouring incident in September. His account appeared similar to that of Seah except that both Lim and Seah claimed they had said almost identical things to Phyu Phyu Mar. Lim also told Phyu Phyu Mar he would buy her cream to apply on her injuries. Yet, Lim omitted to mention such an incident in his statement to the police. In contrast, Phyu Phyu Mar’s evidence was that Seah had told Lim to return to his room after the second cup had been poured on herself. Bearing in mind that Seah and Lim are husband and wife, I was alive to the possibility of Seah and Lim conspiring to fabricate their account of the incident. I found that the prosecution had successfully impeached the Lim’s credit using his statement.

70     With respect to Seah, I agreed with prosecution that her testimony could not be believed. She claimed that Phyu Phyu Mar had made these false allegations against her because she refused to lend money to her and because she had wanted to send Phyu Phyu Mar back to the agency.

71     First, it was not disputed in this trial that Phyu Phyu Mar was not paid her monthly salary of $700 throughout her employment. It was only after intervention by the Ministry of Manpower that the full sum of her salary was given to her in November 2016. It beggars belief that Phyu Phyu Mar did not bother asking Seah for the salary that had not been paid to her but instead asked for a loan of $5,000 from Seah.

72     Furthermore, Seah’s reason for not loaning the money to Phyu Phyu Mar because the correct address of her home was not provided simply did not stand up to scrutiny. I fail to see how the provision of a home address would enable Seah to wire money over to Phyu Phyu Mar’s family in any event if she did not even seek the bank account details of Phyu Phyu Mar’s family. Even on Lim’s evidence, he confirmed that Phyu Phyu Mar had called home using Seah’s handphone so there was no reason why Seah did not have her family’s contact number. If Seah had indeed been willing to loan money to her, Phyu Phyu Mar would have been more than willing to provide the details. She had in all likelihood claimed that she was unable to recall her home number and address to avoid being repatriated.

73     It appeared to me that Seah’s interest in obtaining the home address of Phyu Phyu Mar to the extent of even asking the agent Kevin for the details was so that she could repatriate Phyu Phyu Mar instead of sending her back via the agency.

74     Prosecution also confronted Seah with other inconsistencies in her testimony and her statement to the police. Seah gave differing accounts of what she had observed after hearing an alleged bang from the living room due to Phyu Phyu Mar accidentally falling down in the balcony. Seah also gave inconsistent answers as to whether the hot water-pouring incident she had witnessed occurred in August or in September. I found that prosecution had successfully impeached Seah’s credit using her statement.

## Court’s Findings

75     Seah and Lim sought to portray themselves as considerate and concerned employers. But this could not be further from the truth. Instead the employer-employee relationship had become so strained that Seah had refused to speak to Phyu Phyu Mar and Phyu Phyu Mar had to resort to writing a note to Seah to beg her to reconsider her decision to send her away. Seah would often intimidate Phyu Phyu Mar by threatening to report her to the agency and/or the police.

76     Whilst the issue of the lack of food was not the subject matter of the proceeded charges, the evidence was clear from the various witnesses that Phyu Phyu Mar’s weight had plummeted from 50kg to 38 kg in a matter of a few months given her restricted diet of uncooked noodles and biscuits. The medical report noted that she appeared undernourished with wasting over the temporal region and over her limbs. Even Lynette observed that Phyu Phyu Mar ate the biscuits secretly given to her very quickly which showed that she was hungry. Lynette also testified that the frequency of Phyu Phyu Mar asking for food had increased in September. On the other hand, Seah’s explanation that Phyu Phyu Mar wanted to lose weight for aesthetic reasons was simply untenable. My findings on the specific charges are set out below.

## MCN 901530-2017 - Punching Phyu Phyu Mar twice

77     I accepted that Lim interacted with Phyu Phyu Mar less frequently compared to Seah. However, I found Phyu Phyu Mar’s account of the incident to be clear and unshaken even under vigorous cross-examination – that he had punched her after he thought that she had thrown away his spectacles and she felt pain after that. Whilst Phyu Phyu Mar was unable to recall the exact timing of Lim’s attack on her, and whether it was evening or night, she was able to maintain that the incident came about after Seah had hit her for the third time the same day of 13 October 2016. In my opinion, this was in no way a material inconsistency as she was clear about the sequence of events that took place.

78     Whilst the medical evidence did not conclusively show that Phyu Phyu Mar suffered any physical injuries or bruises from the two punches inflicted by Lim. The fact that Phyu Phyu Mar did not recount this incident by Lim to others until much later on did not mean that the act never occurred at all. It was possible that Lim’s act was simply overshadowed by the severity of Seah’s acts.

## MAC 906780-2017 – Late August instigating victim to knock head on floor

79     I found it implausible that Phyu Phyu Mar would knock her head on the floor on her own accord. Instead, Phyu Phyu Mar did so because she thought that the agency had instructed her to do knock her head through Seah. After all, Phyu Phyu Mar had just heard Seah speaking with the agent on the phone. Seah told her to continue hitting her head until she could hear the sound of her head hitting the floor and Phyu Phyu Mar suffered great pain as a result of this.

## MAC 906778-2018 – Late August instigating victim to pour hot water on left shoulder

80     Seah claimed that the IO had recorded her statement at P10 inaccurately. She further says that if there had been injuries, this would have been discovered during the Dr Wong’s September medical examination of Phyu Phyu Mar.

81     I preferred Phyu Phyu Mar’s evidence which had been consistent throughout that she had to pour 3 cups of water on 2 occasions, i.e. 1 cup in August and 2 cups in September. It was also clear from her evidence that she suffered less injury during the first pouring compared to the second incident in September, thus her injuries would have been less obvious. Moreover, it was possible that Phyu Phyu Mar had worn covered clothing and such injuries would not have been visible unless Dr Wong had been specifically looking out for the same.

## MAC 906779-2017 – Late September instigating victim to pour hot water on left shoulder twice

82     I found it inconsistent that whilst Seah claimed Phyu Phyu Mar poured the hot water on herself, she only told DW4 that the victim had threatened to pour hot water on herself. It seemed that Seah was trying to conceal the incident to avoid any probing into how Phyu Phyu Mar may have gotten injured.

83     Phyu Phyu Mar did not come across as someone who was aggressive or impulsive and resort to drastic measures to obtain what she wanted or worse. She wanted to continue working for Seah despite her suffering and it was inconceivable that she would risk having her job terminated if she were to pour hot water on herself.

84     Forced to choose between the lesser of two evils (i.e. risk being accused of pouring hot water on Seah or pouring it on herself), Phyu Phyu Mar was compelled to pour the hot water on herself - and it did not end there. Seah was dissatisfied with how most of the water had landed on the floor instead of on Phyu Phyu Mar and insisted that she pour it once again on the same side. Even when Phyu Phyu Mar begged her to allow her to pour the hot water on the other shoulder, Seah insisted that she pour it on the same side.

85     I was also not convinced that Lim and Seah were both present in the aftermath of the incident and were concerned about Phyu Phyu Mar’s wellbeing. Instead, it was more likely than not that Lim would have gone back to his room as instructed by Seah and did not get involved.

**MAC 910505-2017 – Causing victim to take water adulterated with floor cleaner**

86     I did not find that the incidents as described by Seah would lead Phyu Phyu Mar to readily want to drink the dirty water. Moreover, Seah testified in cross-examination that she had seen Phyu Phyu Mar drink the dirty water, although she subsequently realised the inconsistency of her answer and corrected what she had said.

## MAC 906781-2017 – Grabbing her by her hair and shaking her until quite a lot of her hair fell out

87     There was no reason to doubt Phyu Phyu Mar’s version that Seah had grabbed her hair. This was because of Phyu Phyu Mar’s retort of disbelief when Seah told her she would not report her to the agency or call the police anymore. Whilst I note that Seah had been careful prior to this incident to not directly cause hurt to Phyu Phyu Mar but make Phyu Phyu Mar harm herself, Seah had in her anger perceived that Phyu Phyu Mar did not trust her and pulled her hair on the right side of her head. Even with short hair, it was likely that some hair fell out.

## MAC 906782-2017 – Hitting multiple times with mobile phone

88     Phyu Phyu Mar’s evidence had been consistent that it was a pink iPhone. Seah however maintained that Phyu Phyu Mar had taken her iPhone 4 and not her pink iPhone to hit herself on her eye and head. I note that Seah was unable to produce the said iPhone 4. The exhibit P3 is in fact a rose gold iPhone 6S Plus – which is larger than the regular iPhone 6S. An iPhone 4 on the other hand is a much smaller phone and shorter in length compared to the iPhone 6S Plus. It seemed unnatural for one to hold an iPhone 4 in such a way as to be able to hit oneself on the face. More importantly, it would not explain why Phyu Phyu hands also suffered bruises unless she had used the phone to hit her own hand which was covering her eye. I preferred Phyu Phyu Mar’s version which was that Seah had inflicted the blows on her using her pink iPhone 6S Plus. This would explain the fact that Phyu Phyu Mar had bruises on her hands as well – because she was shielding her eyes from the impact of the phone.

89     I further note that Seah’s statement to the IO at A16 and A17[^49] indicated that she had nothing to say, or was unable to recall such an incident. The only reason why Seah claimed that it was an iPhone 4 was to prevent the IO from confiscating her pink iPhone.

90     In summary, I was of the view that prosecution had proven their case on each of the charges above beyond reasonable doubt and I found Lim guilty and convicted on one charge, and Seah guilty and convicted on six charges.

## Mitigation and Sentencing

91     Both the accused were untraced. In mitigation, counsel for Lim and Seah submitted that the couple have a 7-year-old daughter who would be highly reliant on them during her developmental years. The adverse publicity also took a toll on Lim’s business and he was in debt.

92     A custodial term is almost invariably warranted in cases of domestic maid abuse where there has been any manner of physical abuse and I was satisfied that the custodial threshold had been crossed here. The sentencing framework as set out in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ is of guidance. In this case, the principles of deterrence and retribution would be the key considerations.

## Lim Toon Leng

93     In respect of Lim who was convicted of one charge, prosecution sought an imprisonment term of two months whilst defence submitted that four weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate. I was of the view that this was a one-off incident as his interaction with the victim was far less than with Seah.

94     Given that the victim did not relate the incident to others until much later in the investigation process, I was of the view that the psychological impact arising from this act was minimal. Lim faced just one charge compared to the two charges that the female accused Chia Yun Ling faced in the _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ precedent cited, thus I was of the view that an imprisonment term of 6 weeks was appropriate.

## Seah Lei Sie Linda

95     With respect to Seah, prosecution sought a global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment for the offences. The defence submitted that a sentence of six to eight months’ imprisonment for MAC906779-2017 and MAC906782-2017 and three months’ imprisonment for the rest of the charges would be appropriate.

96     Psychological harm was suffered by the victim in the way Seah conducted herself to oppress, isolate and humiliate the victim. I found that Seah’s acts were calculated - by asking the victim to pour hot water on herself, or telling the victim that the agency had asked for the victim to knock her head on the floor, Seah hoped to avoid blame for the injuries suffered by the victim. Further examples of Seah’s acts to oppress Phyu Phyu Mar are set out below:

a.     Phyu Phyu Mar was denied food which led to her being malnourished;

b.     She was not paid her salary throughout her employment;

c.     Seah constantly threatened to report the victim to the police;

d.     Phyu Phyu Mar was discouraged from interacting with the staff at Seah’s beauty salon;

e.     Even when the police visited the flat, Phyu Phyu Mar was told to lie to the police.

97     Other aggravating factors in this case include the clear lack of remorse, which demands a more severe sentencing in the interests of retribution and specific deterrence. Seah’s unhappiness with the victim’s work did not justify any form of violence against the Phyu Phyu Mar.

98     For MAC-906782-2017 (using mobile phone to hit victim), whilst prosecution had submitted for a sentence of 9 months, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence should be higher as the level of psychological and physical harm was comparable to that of MAC-906781-2017 (knocking head on floor). It was fortuitous that the victim managed to use her hands to shield the blows that were aimed at her face, otherwise she would have suffered more serious injuries to her face and/or eye area.

99     For the other sentences, I agreed with prosecution’s submissions as to the length of imprisonment and have placed them within the sentencing framework in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ for section 323 charges as set out below:

100    As for MAC-910505-2017 (causing victim to drink water with floor cleaner), this is a charge under section 328 of which the maximum imprisonment term is 10 years. I agreed with prosecution’s submissions and having calibrated it against the precedents cited[^50] which ranged from 8 months’ to 4 years’ imprisonment, I imposed a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment for this charge. Seah’s culpability here was high and an aggravating factor here was that it had taken place right after she had asked the victim to pour boiling water on herself twice. The psychological harm to the victim would be far higher in such an instance and Phyu Phyu Mar did in fact drink the adulterated water because of her fear of Seah.

101    To summarise, the sentences I ordered for Seah were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="31.46%"> <col width="35.2%"> <col width="33.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>SEAH LEI SIE LINDA (B2)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Particulars</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-906778-2017</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s.323 read with s.109 and s.73 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Late August 2016</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Abetment by instigating her to pour hot water on left shoulder</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-906780-2017</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s.323 read with s.109 and s.73 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Late August 2016</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Abetment by instigating her to knock head on floor</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-906779-2017</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s.323 read with s.109 and s.73 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Late September 2016</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Abetment by instigating her to pour hot water on left shoulder twice</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20 months</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-910505-2017</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s.328 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Late September 2016</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Causing her to take water adulterated with floor cleaner</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-906781-2017</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s.323 read with s.73 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Late September 2016</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Grabbing her by her hair and shaking her until quite a lot of her hair fell out</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 months</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-906782-2017</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s.323 read with s.73 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 October 2016</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Using mobile phone to hit her multiple times on forehead, left eye and left hand</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 months</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consecutive)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

102    I further agreed that three of the sentences should run consecutively to reflect the culpability and harm caused by Seah. In my view, the acts of pouring two cups of hot water and using the mobile phone to hit the victim were the most egregious acts and therefore should run consecutively. The totality principle also requires that the overall sentence not be too crushing on the accused. I thus ordered that MAC-906781-2017, MAC-906782-2017 and MAC-906779-2017 run consecutively, giving a total of 36 months’ imprisonment.

## Compensation

103    Compensation is appropriate in maid abuse cases. The appropriate heads of compensation here would be pain and suffering suffered as a result of the offences, and the loss of earnings as a result of being unemployed after the incident.

104    Apart from the injuries which have been documented in the medical report, I noted from the victim’s impact statement that even up till now, she still has a scar on her left shoulder and she would have to always wear a jacket to cover up.

105    Pursuant to section 359 of the Penal Code, I ordered compensation of $500 to be paid by Lim to the victim through the investigation officer in respect of pain and suffering caused to the victim for this charge.

106    In respect of Seah, I agreed with prosecution’s submissions that a total of $9000 be awarded to the victim for pain and suffering, the breakdown as follows:

a.     MAC-906778-2017 - $1000

b.     MAC-906780-2017 - $1000

c.     MAC-906779-2017 - $5000

d.     MAC-910505-2017 - $500

e.     MAC-906781-2017 - $500

f.     MAC-906782-2017 - $1000

107    The compensation awarded for pain and suffering is in line with the ranges as stated in _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010). For MAC-906779-2017, the sum of $5,000 was warranted as Phyu Phyu Mar suffered injuries from the two cups of boiling water being poured on herself.

108    As for the loss of income, in line with _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_, a compensation of 4 months’ salary amounting to $2800 should be paid to Phyu Phyu Mar. However, in this case, given that Lim was convicted of just one charge and had relatively limited contact with Phyu Phyu Mar, it would not be appropriate that he bore the compensation of the loss of income equally with Seah. I therefore ordered that the $2800 be borne solely by Seah rather than be apportioned equally.

109    As for the $200 for cost of airfare sought by prosecution, I agreed with defence counsel’s submission that the security bond of $5000 was meant to cover repatriation, food and accommodation costs. This is also apparent from MOM’s website.[^51] As the bond had already been forfeited by MOM, it was not necessary to order a compensation of $200 for airfare.

110    The total compensation payable by Seah to Phyu Phyu Mar was $11,800 in default six weeks’ imprisonment.
