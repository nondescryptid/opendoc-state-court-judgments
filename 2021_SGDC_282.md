### District Judge Seah Chi-Ling:

## Introduction

1       The present case arose out of the sale of shares in NSC Capital Pte Ltd (the first Defendant) by one Wang Jian (the Plaintiff) to one Chan Tam Hoi @ Paul Chan (the second Defendant). Specifically, the dispute relates to the agreed consideration for the share transfer. The Defendants contended that the agreed sale price was $1.00 as indicated in the share transfer form, whereas the Plaintiff contended that the agreed sale price for the shares was $467,165.00 based on an oral agreement.

## The parties

2       The Plaintiff, Wang Jian, is a Chinese national from the People’s Republic of China, and an ex-director and ex-shareholder of the first Defendant. She is the daughter of one Wang Bin, also a Chinese national from the People’s Republic of China.

3       The first Defendant, NSC Capital Pte Ltd (“**NSC Capital**” or “**1st Defendant**”)), was previously known as NSC Executive Centre Pte Ltd (“**NSC Executive Centre**”). NSC Executive Centre was incorporated on 29 November 1997 and changed its name to NSC Capital on 11 May 2018. Both NSC Executive Centre and NSC Capital were in the business of managing and operating a business service center at 152 Beach Road, Level 28, Gateway East, Singapore 189721 at the material time.

4       The second Defendant, Chan Tam Hoi @ Paul Chan (“**2nd Defendant**”), is currently the sole director and majority shareholder of the 1st Defendant.

## Procedural History

5       On 5 November 2019, the Plaintiff commenced HC/S 1137/2019 in the High Court against the 1st and 2nd Defendants, claiming, _inter alia_, the sum of S$467,165.00. By an order of court dated 12 February 2020, HC/S 1137/2019 was transferred to the State Courts in DC/DC 533/2020 by consent. The parties executed a memorandum under section 23 of the State Courts Act (Cap. 321, 2007 Rev Ed) enlarging the District Court’s jurisdiction to hear the present case.

## Background Facts

### Plaintiff’s original investment in 2012

6       On or around 13 December 2012, the Plaintiff purchased 360,000 shares in NSC Executive Centre, representing 30% of the issued shares of the company, from an existing shareholder, one Lu Jinyang (“**Lu**”). The issued capital and paid-up capital of NSC Capital is $1,200,000.00[^1]. The sale and purchase of the shares was evidenced by a Share Transfer form dated 13 December 2012 signed by the Plaintiff and Lu (the “**2012 Share Transfer Form**”)[^2]. According to the Plaintiff, the consideration paid by the Plaintiff for the shares was $400,000.00, though the Defendants’ position was that the consideration was only $216,315.00, as stated in the 2012 Share Transfer Form.

7       The Plaintiff was concurrently appointed as a director of NSC Executive Centre on 13 December 2012.

8       The Plaintiff remained a shareholder and a Director of NSC Capital when NSC Executive Centre was renamed NSC Capital on 11 May 2018.

### Sale of Plaintiff’s Shares in November 2018

9       The Plaintiff ceased to be a shareholder of NSC Capital when she transferred her 360,000 shares in NSC Capital (the “**Shares**”) to the 2nd Defendant on 21 November 2018. On the share transfer form dated 21 November 2018 (the “**2018 Share Transfer Form**”), the consideration for the transfer was reflected as $1.00. Both the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant signed the 2018 Share Transfer Form[^3]. The Plaintiff also resigned and ceased to be a director of NSC Capital with effect from the same date[^4].

10     The sale and purchase of the Shares in November 2018 formed the subject matter of the present dispute.

11     The 2nd Defendant became the sole Director of the 1st Defendant on 21 November 2018 when the then directors – Fung Hoo Wing Thomas, Herman Judi Widjaja and the Plaintiff – resigned as directors of NSC Capital[^5]. The present shareholders of the 1st Defendant and their respective shareholdings are as follows, with the 2nd Defendant being the majority shareholder with a 55% shareholding:

> (a)     Jiu Sze Ying Nancy – 420,000 shares,

> (b)     Lu Jinyang – 120,000 shares, and

> (c)     2nd Defendant – 660,000 shares.[^6]

### Events of 30 January 2019

12     At about 5.00pm on 30 January 2019, the Plaintiff’s father (Wang Bin) turned up at the 1st Defendant’s premises. The Plaintiff was already at the premises. It was not disputed that on this occasion, the 2nd Defendant had executed a letter dated 30 January 2019 which had been printed on the 1st Defendant’s letterhead and which bore the 1st Defendant’s company stamp (the “**30 January Meeting**”). The letter, addressed to the Plaintiff, contained the statement: _“We will buy back the 30% of your investment in NSC Capital for the amount of SGD $467,165.00”_, and was executed by the 2nd Defendant on behalf of the 1st Defendant.

13     The next day, on 31 January 2019, the Plaintiff and Wang Bin turned up at the 1st Defendant’s premises again at about 5.00pm and procured the 2nd Defendant’s signature on a revised version of the letter dated 30 January 2019 that had been prepared by the Plaintiff. The revised letter (also dated 30 January 2019) was addressed to the Plaintiff and contained the statements _“We will buy back the 30% of your investment in NSC Capital for the amount of SGD $467,165.00”_ and _“The funds will be returned to your account (Bank account: XXX85) between today and the expiry date of your Visa in Singapore.”[^7]_ The second letter is, in substance, identical to the first letter save that it contained the account details to which the $467,165.00 was to be transferred to and a timeframe for payment to be made. Similarly, the 2nd Defendant executed the revised letter on behalf of the 1st Defendant (the “**30 January Letter**”).

### Events of 6 May 2019

14     Despite the execution of the 30 January Letter and the transfer of the Shares to the 2nd Defendant, the sum of $467,165.00 was never paid by the 1st Defendant and/or the 2nd Defendant to the Plaintiff.

15     At about 3.00pm on 6 May 2019, Wang Bin went to the 1st Defendant’s premises and demanded payment of the sum of $467,165.00 from the 2nd Defendant (the “**6 May Meeting**”). The Plaintiff’s mother, Qi Ling, was also present during the meeting. There was a heated exchange between Wang Bin and the 2nd Defendant at the meeting when the 2nd Defendant was completely non-committal about paying the sum of $467,165.00. Wang Bin became increasingly agitated as the meeting progressed and started shouting and speaking to the 2nd Defendant in a very loud voice. The 2nd Defendant called for support. Security personnel as well as police officers arrived at the premises, but the 2nd Defendant intimated that their assistance was not required. Wang Bin secretly made an audio recording of the meeting, a transcript of which was tendered in evidence in court (the “**6 May Transcripts**”).[^8]

### Commencement of present action

16     In late August 2019, Invictus Law Corporation issued a letter of demand dated 26 August 2019 on behalf of the Plaintiff against both the 1st Defendant and 2nd Defendant. In the letter of demand, the Plaintiff’s solicitors demanded payment of the sum of $467,165.00 from the 1st Defendant and 2nd Defendant by 3 September 2019, failing which the Plaintiff would commence legal proceedings. On 27 September 2019, the 1st Defendant’s and 2nd Defendant’s previous solicitors (Drew & Napier LLC) responded to the letter of demand, denying liability for the said sum._[^9]_ The Plaintiff thereafter issued a writ against the 1st Defendant and 2nd Defendant on 5 November 2019.

## The Parties’ Case

### The Plaintiff’s claim against 2nd Defendant

17     The Plaintiff’s case against the 2nd Defendant is based on a breach of an alleged oral agreement (the “**Oral Agreement**”) between the 2nd Defendant and Wang Bin (acting on behalf of the Plaintiff) entered into in or around November 2018 wherein the 2nd Defendant agreed to purchase the Shares from the Plaintiff at the sum of S$467,165.00 (the “**Purchase Price**”).

18     The Plaintiff’s case was that she had paid $400,000.00 for the Shares as an investment in 2012. Sometime in 2018, she had doubts about the viability and profitability of the 1st Defendant’s business. She started to review the accounts and records of the 1st Defendant and realized that the 1st Defendant had not been profitable. She then decided to seek a return of her investment in the 1st Defendant. As she had to travel back to China to deal with some personal matters, her father, Wang Bin, represented her in the negotiations with the 2nd Defendant regarding her exit and the recoupment of her investment. Wang Bin subsequently informed the Plaintiff that at a meeting with the 2nd Defendant in or around the middle of November 2018, the 2nd Defendant had agreed to purchase the Shares from the Plaintiff at a sum of $467,165.00 (the “**Oral Agreement**”)[^10]. The sale price represented the 2nd Defendant’s valuation of the Shares. The Plaintiff was prepared to accept the offer. The 2nd Defendant further proposed that the Plaintiff transfer the Shares to the 2nd Defendant at a nominal sum of $1.00 first, and the 2nd Defendant would then pay her the Purchase Price at a later date[^11]. The Plaintiff proceeded to execute the share transfer form, letter of resignation as director, and directors’ resolution sent to her by the 2nd Defendant’s operations manager[^12].

### The Plaintiff’s alternate claim against 1st Defendant

19     In the alternative, the Plaintiff claimed against the 1st Defendant for breach of a written agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant arising from the January Meeting as evidenced by the 30 January Letter. The letter agreement was signed by the 2nd Defendant as the sole director for and on behalf of the 1st Defendant. Under the letter agreement, the 1st Defendant agreed to buy back the Shares from the Plaintiff at the Purchase Price, which shall be paid to the Plaintiff’s specified bank account between 30 January 2019 and the expiry of the Plaintiff’s visa in Singapore[^13].

20     According to the Plaintiff, she had required the 30 January Letter to be executed as the 2nd Defendant had failed to effect payment of the Purchase Price for more than two months after the conclusion of the Oral Agreement. In fact, two months after the Plaintiff had executed the share transfer form transferring the Shares to the 2nd Defendant, the Plaintiff and Wang Bin attempted to set up a meeting with the 2nd Defendant at his office, but was informed that the 2nd Defendant was not in. On 30 January 2019, Plaintiff and Wang Bin proceeded to show up at the 2nd Defendant’s office unannounced and found him in the office[^14]. Plaintiff enquired of 2nd Defendant when she would be receiving the Purchase Price, only to be met with lots of excuses from the 2nd Defendant. As she had lost all confidence in the 2nd Defendant, she demanded a written confirmation from the 2nd Defendant as to when she would receive the Purchase Price. The 2nd Defendant, as sole director of the 1st Defendant, then issued the 30 January Letter on behalf of the 1st Defendant confirming that the 1st Defendant would buy back the Shares from Plaintiff at a sum of $467,165.00[^15]. The Plaintiff claimed she did not have much choice but to accept the letter in the form executed by the 2nd Defendant even though she would have preferred a written agreement which stated that the 2nd Defendant would personally pay the Purchase Price[^16]. The Plaintiff and Wang Bin left after procuring the written confirmation.

21     The Plaintiff and Wang Bin, however, returned the next day (31 January 2019) and procured the 2nd Defendant’s execution of a similar letter, save that the revised letter also contained Plaintiff receiving bank account details and specified a deadline for payment, _viz_ between 30 January 2019 and the expiry date of the Plaintiff’s visa in Singapore. The Plaintiff has thus sought to recover the Purchase Price from the 1st Defendant in the alternative on the basis of the 30 January letter agreement.

### The Defence

22     The 2nd Defendant’s defence was that there was no agreement between the 2nd Defendant and the Plaintiff for the 2nd Defendant to purchase the Shares from the Plaintiff at the Purchase Price. The agreement reached was for the Plaintiff to transfer the Shares to the 2nd Defendant at the nominal sum of S$1.00 as indicated on the 2018 Share Transfer Form[^17]. According to the 2nd Defendant, the Plaintiff wanted to withdraw from further involvement in NSC Capital’s business because she could not fulfill the requirements and expectations the 2nd Defendant had for her to contribute to the growth of NSC Capital’s business. By transferring all her shares to 2nd Defendant for a nominal sum of $1.00 and resigning as a director of the company, the Plaintiff would thereby be relieved of any obligations and expectations placed on her as a director and shareholder of NSC Capital[^18].

23     As for the claim against the 1st Defendant based on the 30 January Letter, the Defendants contended that the original and revised 30 January letters were executed by the 2nd Defendant under duress.

## My Decision

### Plaintiff’s Claim Against 2nd Defendant

24     At the conclusion of the trial, I allowed the Plaintiff’s claim against the 2nd Defendant. I was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the 2nd Defendant and Plaintiff (through her father Wang Bin) did reach a verbal agreement in or around November 2018 in which the 2nd Defendant agreed to purchase the Shares from the Plaintiff at the Purchase Price. It was on the basis of the Oral Agreement that Plaintiff proceeded to transfer her Shares to the 2nd Defendant on 21 November 2018 and resign as a director of NSC Capital.

### Plaintiff’s Claim Against 1st Defendant

25     Having found for the Plaintiff against 2nd Defendant, I accordingly dismissed the Plaintiff’s alternate claim against the 1st Defendant. The documentary evidence suggested that the transferee and/or buyer of the Shares was always intended to be the _2nd Defendant_ and not the 1st Defendant. For example: (a) it was clear from the 2018 Share Transfer Form that the _transferee_ was stated as the _2nd Defendant_ and not NSC Capital_[^19];_ (b) the director’s resolutions passed by 1st Defendant to approve the share transfer also stated the _transferee_ of the Shares as the _2nd Defendant_ and not the 1st Defendant[^20]; (c) the ACRA records showed the shareholding changes as involving a transfer of the Shares from the Plaintiff _to the 2nd Defendant_ and not a share buyback by the 1st Defendant[^21]; and (d) I also considered the fact that the claim against the 1st Defendant involved, in essence, a share buyback by the 1st Defendant, which is prohibited under section 76(1A)(a)(i) of the Companies Act (Cap. 50, 2006 Rev Ed). Any transaction entered into in breach of the provisions would be void under section 76A(1)(a) of the Companies Act. There are exceptions under the Companies Act, but none of the exceptions applied here, given the complete lack of evidence suggesting that the requisite steps required to effect a share buyback under the Companies Act had been complied with.

26     The 2nd Defendant is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed the present appeal against my decision. I have set out my detailed grounds for allowing the Plaintiff’s claim against the 2nd Defendant below.

27     As neither party has challenged my dismissal of the Plaintiff’s claim against the 1st Defendant, I will not be setting out my detailed reasons for dismissing the claim against the 1st Defendant save for the summary that has already been provided under paragraph \[25\] above.

## The Issues

28     Based on the pleadings, the Plaintiff’s case against the 2nd Defendant is a simple one, namely that the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant had reached an Oral Agreement in or around November 2018 whereby the Plaintiff would sell, and the 2nd Defendant would purchase, the Shares for a total consideration of $467,165.00.

29     The 2nd Defendant has in turn pleaded a sole, unitary defence – namely that while there was an agreed transfer of the Shares from the Plaintiff to the 2nd Defendant, the agreed price was not $467,175.00 but a nominal sum of $1.00 as stated in the share transfer form dated 21 November 2018[^22]. The 2nd Defendant raised an associated argument that the 30 January Letter, in which the 2nd Defendant affirmed the sale price of the Shares as being $467,165.00, was executed by the 2nd Defendant under duress, and thus should not be given any evidential weight.

30     Whether the Plaintiff’s version or the 2nd Defendant’s version was to be believed necessarily entailed a fact finding exercise, which I considered under the following two broad headings:

> (a)     Whether it was probable that the Plaintiff had agreed to transfer her 360,000 shares in NSC Capital to the 2nd Defendant at a nominal consideration of $1.00. This was in effect the 2nd Defendant’s sole defence; and

> (b)     If not, whether the Plaintiff and 2nd Defendant had, in or around November 2018, reached an oral agreement whereby the 2nd Defendant would acquire the Plaintiff’s Shares for $467,165.00.

## Preliminary observations

### Consideration stated in share transfer form inconclusive

31     Before analyzing the parties’ claim, I will first make a number of preliminary observations.

32     It is trite that the consideration stated in a share transfer form is not conclusive as to the true consideration paid or to be paid for the shares. The learned author of _Walter Woon on Company Law_ (Revised Third Edition, General Editor Tan Cheng Han SC, Sweet & Maxwell, Thomson Reuters) noted at \[11.126\]:

> “A transfer is valid notwithstanding that it is not actually signed on the date stated. _Evidence may be led to show that the consideration stated in an instrument of transfer is untrue. There is no estoppel based on such a statement_.” _\[Emphasis added\]_

33     The evidence would therefore necessarily need to be examined to determine the actual price at which it was agreed that the 2nd Defendant would purchase the Shares.

### Amount of original investment by Plaintiff in 2012

34     A further issue that is relevant to the fact finding exercise which should be determined preliminarily is the price at which the Plaintiff acquired the Shares from Lu in 2012, given that there was a dispute between the parties whether the Plaintiff originally paid $400,000.00 or $216,315.00 (the consideration reflected in the 2012 Share Transfer Form) for the Shares.

35     On a balance of probabilities, and notwithstanding what was stated in the 2012 Share Transfer Form, I found that the original amount paid by the Plaintiff for the shares was $400,000.00 as contended by the Plaintiff:

> (a)     The Plaintiff’s assertion in this regard was corroborated by PW1 Tan Swea Phing (“**PW1 Tang**”), the 2nd Defendant’s ex-accountant, who testified that the Plaintiff first invested $400,000.00 by acquiring the Shares from Lu in 2012[^23]. Defence Counsel challenged the partiality of PW1 Tang’s testimony as there appeared to have been a falling out between PW1 and the 2nd Defendant, with the two currently being embroiled in an ongoing lawsuit[^24]. PW1’s testimony on the original investment amount by the Plaintiff was, however, supported by a WhatsApp message between PW1 Tang and the 2nd Defendant dated 25 February 2016 in which references was made to an investment involving the Plaintiff in the amount of _“$400k in nov2011_”[^25]. At trial, PW1 Tang clarified that due to an inadvertent slip, all references made by her in her affidavit to the Plaintiff’s investment in 2011 should have been to 2012 instead[^26]. I accepted that the erroneous references to 2011 was likely to be due to a genuine mistake caused by the effluxion of time, and that the $400,000 mentioned pertained to the Plaintiff’s purchase of Lu’s shares in NSC Capital in November 2012.

> (b)     That the Plaintiff acquired the shares for $400,000 was further corroborated by a November 2012 bank statement adduced by the Plaintiff[^27] which showed that a cheque in the amount of $400,000 was issued from the Plaintiff’s mother, Mdm Qi Ling’s, OCBC bank account. The Plaintiff explained, and I accepted, that it was the practice amongst the Plaintiff’s family to comingle their bank funds in Singapore as the Plaintiff did not have a Singapore bank account at the material time. Given the proximity in time between the disbursement of the $400,000.00 from Qi Ling’s OCBC bank account and the Plaintiff’s acquisition of Lu’s shares, it was probable, in my view, that the $400,000.00 was the amount used by the Plaintiff to acquire the Shares in 2012. On a balance of probabilities, I accepted that the original investment amount by the Plaintiff was $400,000.00.

## Issue 1 – Whether Plaintiff agreed to transfer the Shares to 2nd Defendant at $1.00

36     Against the backdrop of the above observations, I turn now to the main issues. Having reviewed the evidence before me, it was in my view, highly improbable and wholly inconsistent with the evidence that the Plaintiff would have agreed to transfer the Shares to the 2nd Defendant for a nominal sum of $1.00. It was more likely that the agreement was for the Plaintiff to transfer the Shares to the 2nd Defendant at a nominal sum of $1.00 first, with the 2nd Defendant to pay the actual Purchase Price at a later date. I considered the following.

### No enforced expectations or requirements placed on Plaintiff

37     First, the 2nd Defendant’s contention that Plaintiff had agreed to sell Shares which she purchased for $400,000 to him at $1.00 was on its face completely illogical and made no commercial sense at all. The 2nd Defendant’s explanation was that the Plaintiff had wanted to withdraw from being further involved in NSC Capital’s business as she could not fulfill the “requests” and “expectations” that 2nd Defendant had for her to contribute towards the growth of NSC Capital’s business. By transferring her Shares at $1.00 to the 2nd Defendant and resigning as a director of the company, the Plaintiff would thereby be relieved of these expectations and requirements.

38     However, when questioned by Plaintiff’s Counsel as to the exact nature of these “expectations” and “requirements” both at the time of the Plaintiff’s investment and her time of exit, the 2nd Defendant conceded that there was never any “term laid on the Plaintiff as a condition of her continuing her shareholding or directorship”. There might have been “expectations” that Plaintiff would help expand the Nanjing business but these were based on “requests” which 2nd Defendant did not “require or enforce”:

_Cross examination of 2nd Defendant on 22 April 2021_ [^28]

Q Okay. Maybe let’s start from the beginning.

A Okay.

Q _In 2012 when she became a shareholder and also a director, were these so-called requirements and expectations already there?_

A _No. Not---not---not all there but I think partly, definitely there._ Like---because we definitely need, another representative office in Nanjing …..

Q Okay. And in 2012 ---what are the content of these requirements and expectations?

…..

A _I don’t remember whether we lay any terms with her_ but I think I strongly demand we have to set up a office representation office of NSC in Nanjing.

Q _Was that made a condition to her continued directorship and shareholding in NSC? Meaning if this condition was not fulfilled, she had to resign as a director or sell back her shares. Anything like that?_

A _No, never_

Q Okay. So, how did these requirements and expectations change over the years until 2018 November?

A Because my ex-accountant left. I have no assistant. _I hope she can help._

……..

Q Yes. _That sounds like a request and plea to me. Not a requirement and expectation._

A _Okay._

Q _Will you agree?_

A _Look, in a way that I don’t require and I don’t enforce but if you can, you can, if you can’t._ Because the---the enquire---this particular enquiry state in---because we have a casual issue. Either you are topping up or you should leave. This I---I’m not emphasise on her. I also talked to the father. …….

### No reasons for Plaintiff to write-off her investment completely

39     The 2nd Defendant was further, by his own admission, in the process of turning his business around, including establishing a holding company called “Menon” to which he had purportedly transferred NSC Capital’s profitable accounts. He even claimed that NSC Capital would be profitable within one year, and that he had plans to list NSC Capital:

_\[Emphasis added\]_

 |

  
  

40     Regardless of whether what the 2nd Defendant said about turning NSC Capital’s business around was believable, there was certainly no downside to Plaintiff staying on as a _shareholder_, even if the company were in financial difficulties. For instance, she could, if she wanted, have resigned as a _director_, but stayed on as a _shareholder_. For her to write off her investment completely by selling her Shares at $1.00 just did not make sense. In my mind, the only reason she would agree to divest of her Shares is if she were bought out at a substantial consideration. I also noted that the 2nd Defendant’s present contention was also completely disconsonant with portions of the 6 May Transcripts in which the 2nd Defendant portrayed the Plaintiff as a greedy and money-grabbing individual:

### WhatsApp message from 2nd Defendant to PW1 Tang

41     Thirdly, the WhatsApp message from 2nd Defendant to PW1 Tang on 28 November 2018, a few days after the 2018 Share Transfer Form was executed on 21 November 2018, also contradicted the 2nd Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff was willing to write off her shares for $1.00. It was not disputed that it was customary for Wang Bin to negotiate on the Plaintiff’s behalf with the Defendants on her investment in, and exit from, NSC Capital. In the WhatsApp message, the 2nd Defendant mentioned to PW1 Tang that Wang Bin wanted to sell his shares (which is, in fact, a reference to the Plaintiff’s shares) for a consideration of some $460,000:

### Sale at substantial consideration envisaged in 30 January 2019 Letter

42     Fourthly, there were also various documentary records that showed the Plaintiff was expecting to sell her Shares for a substantial sum. In the 30 January Letter executed by the 2nd Defendant on behalf of 1st Defendant some two months after the 2018 Share Transfer Form was executed, the 2nd Defendant had confirmed to the Plaintiff on behalf of 1st Defendant that “we would buy back 30% of you investment in NSC Capital for the amount of $467,165.00”[^34] within the time frame stated therein. Even the receiving account details were spelt out. The 30 January 2019 Letter was consistent with the Plaintiff’s case theory that she had at the 2nd Defendant’s request transferred the Shares to him at a nominal sum of $1.00 first, on the understanding that the agreed Purchase Price would be paid at a later date.

### The 6 May 2019 Transcripts

43     Fifthly, the transcripts of the 6 May 2019 meeting between the 2nd Defendant, Wang Bin and Qi Ling were also replete with references to the 2nd Defendant’s promises to purchase the Shares from the Plaintiff at a substantial sum. The 2nd Defendant came up with various excuses as to why payment could not be effected immediately – _e.g._ there were various audit issues and legal issues that they needed to address, they had to “figure out how to buy \[Plaintiff’s\] shares back”, they had to “make the right arrangements” first, _etc._. The point however remained that the 2nd Defendant at no time mentioned that the Shares were already sold to the 2nd Defendant for $1.00 and that that was the end of the matter:

44     It was evident from the 6 May Transcripts that the 2nd Defendant had never expressly denied that the Defendants had promised to pay for the 30% NSC Capital shares at the agreed price. While there were some suggestions in the 6 May Transcripts that the Defendants’ intention was to take money out of the NSC Capital to fulfill the sale price (say by way of a share buy-back or a dividend declaration, which was never clarified at trial), it was never the Defendants’ pleaded position that their obligation to pay the Plaintiff was contingent on their ability to effect such withdrawal. The point remained that the 2nd Defendant had implicitly acknowledged that sums were due to the Plaintiff. The 2nd Defendant had personally acquired the Shares from Plaintiff pursuant to the 2018 Share Transfer Form. The Shares are now under the 2nd Defendant’s name. The primary obligation to pay the sale consideration must therefore have been intended to be assumed by the 2nd Defendant personally. To the extent no time frame had been specified for payment of the sale consideration, it is trite that the amounts must be paid within a reasonable time. Indeed, based on the 6 May Transcripts, the 2nd Defendant was in fact asking for more time to sort out his audit and legal issues so that he could effect payment, as what he originally “thought was doable”[^36] turned out to be impermissible as advised by his lawyers. He therefore needed more time to put in place “the right arrangement”[^37].

45     Viewed as a whole, I found the 2nd Defendant’s sole and only defence that the parties had reached an agreement wherein the Plaintiff would sell the shares to 2nd Defendant for $1.00 to be completely implausible and inconsistent with the evidence. I rejected it outright.

## Issue 2 – Whether there was an agreement between 2nd Defendant and Plaintiff to purchase the Shares at $467,165.00

46     Having rejected the 2nd Defendant’s defence that it was agreed that the Shares would be sold for a consideration of $1.00, the burden still remained on the Plaintiff to prove that the parties had reached an agreement whereby the Shares would be purchased by the 2nd Defendant at $467,165.00.

47     The Plaintiff’s case was that the agreement reached was by way of an oral agreement. In ascertaining whether such an oral agreement existed, the following guiding principles were distilled by the High Court in _ARS v ARTS_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 78</span> at \[53\]:

> “(a)  in ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement, the court will consider _the relevant documentary evidence_ (such as written correspondence) _and contemporaneous conduct of the parties_ at the material time;

> (b)    where possible, _the court should look first at the relevant documentary evidence_;

> (c)    the availability of relevant documentary evidence reduces the need to rely solely on the credibility of witnesses in order to ascertain if an oral agreement exists;

> (d)    oral testimony may be less reliable as it is based on the witness’ recollection and it may be affected by subsequent events (such as the dispute between the parties);

> (e)    credible oral testimony may clarify the existing documentary evidence;

> (f)     _where the witness is not legally trained, the court should not place undue emphasis on the choice of words_; and

> (g)    if there is little or no documentary evidence, the court will nevertheless examine the _precise factual matrix to ascertain if there is an oral agreement_ concluded between the parties.” _(Emphasis added)_

### Documentary Evidence – 2018 Share Transfer Form

48     As noted above, the 2nd Defendant and Plaintiff had on or around 21 November 2018 executed the 2018 Share Transfer Form in which the _2nd Defendant_ was expressly named as the transferee of the Shares[^38]. The requisite Directors’ resolution was also purportedly passed on the same date approving the transfer of the Shares from the Plaintiff to the 2nd Defendant[^39]. The Plaintiff also resigned as a director of NSC Capital with effect from 21 November 2018[^40]. That there had been a sale of the Shares by the Plaintiff to the _2nd Defendant_ (as opposed to the 1st Defendant) could not be seriously disputed. Indeed, the 2nd Defendant’s Defence was _not_ that there was no agreement to transfer the Shares to him, but rather, that the Shares were sold at a nominal sum of $1.00 and not $467,165.00 as claimed by the Plaintiff. The key issue to be resolved therefore was whether there was a common understanding between the parties that the price was $467,165.00.

### Contemporaneous conduct of the parties

49     The first piece of evidence which supported the Plaintiff’s claim that 2nd Defendant had agreed with Plaintiff to purchase the shares at $467,165.00 was the WhatsApp message from the 2nd Defendant to PW1 Tang on 28 November 2018. In the WhatsApp message, 2nd Defendant mentioned to PW1 Tang that “_Wang Bin want to sell his share 1 dollar to $1.50 from NSC and take the money back …..\[at $460,000\]_”: see \[41\] above. I accorded significant weight to this WhatsApp message as it was sent voluntarily by 2nd Defendant to PW1 Tang (when relations between the two were still cordial) shortly after the 2018 Share Transfer Form was executed by Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant. On its face, the message was to update PW1 Tang of the outcome of the discussions DW2 had with Wang Bin. It was not disputed that Wang Bin had represented Plaintiff in much of the negotiations with 2nd Defendant on the terms of the Plaintiff’s exit from NSC Capital.

50     At trial, PW1 Tang’s testimony on the WhatsApp message was that:

> (a)     The 2nd Defendant had valued the Shares at approximately $460,000[^41];

> (b)     That was the price the 2nd Defendant willingly offered to Wang Bin[^42]; and

> (c)     As a businessman, “2nd Defendant had made the valuation because as a businessman, he had already decided the price that he wanted to sell” [^43].

51     In my judgment, the timing and content of the WhatsApp message sent by the 2nd Defendant just one week after the 2018 Share Transfer Form was executed, rendered it probable that Wang Bin and the 2nd Defendant had discussed and eventually agreed on the sale of the Shares at $467,165.00, which approximated the $460,000.00 referenced in the 2nd Defendant’s WhatsApp message.

### The 30 January Letter

52     A further key evidence supporting the Plaintiff’s claim that the purchase price of the Shares was agreed at $467,165.00 was the 30 January Letter executed by 2nd Defendant on behalf of the 1st Defendant which stated that the purchase price was $467,165.00.

53     The genesis of the 30 January Letter was that Plaintiff and Wang Bin had gone to 2nd Defendant’s offices on two consecutive days (30 and 31 January 2019), and procured the letters. The letters were identical except that the 2nd final version contained the Plaintiff’s receiving account details and the payment due date. There was some dispute as to who prepared the 30 January Letter, and whether they were procured from 2nd Defendant under duress. For the reasons discussed below, I found that the 30 January Letter was not procured by duress. The 30 and 31 January meetings were evidently not negotiation meetings, based on the evidence at trial. According to 2nd Defendant, the letters were complete with figures already inserted by Plaintiff, Wang Bin, and/or Ho Chi Man. The 2nd Defendant was simply asked to sign, which he did. The fact that 2nd Defendant was prepared to execute the 30 January Letter suggested that the figure of $467,165.00 had already been discussed and agreed in advance. Viewed together with the fact that fact that the 2018 Share Transfer Form on its face purported to transfer legal ownership of the shares from Plaintiff to the 2nd Defendant, this collectively suggested that an agreement was reached _way before_ 30 January 2019 for the sale and purchase of the Shares from the Plaintiff to the 2nd Defendant at the Purchase Price.

### Failure to call Ho Chi Man

54     It was the Plaintiff’s evidence that she drafted the 30 January Letter and that the figure of $467,165.00 she had inserted was given to her by NSC Capital’s accountant, one Ho Chee Man[^44]. The 2nd Defendant’s testimony, on the other hand, was that Ho Chi Man had confessed to him that Wang Bin had pressurized him to prepare the letter. Wang Bin had come up with the figure of $467,165.00 himself and pressurized Ho Chi Man to insert it into the letter[^45].

55     I would first note that the figure of $467,165.00 is a very precise number. It was more likely to have been derived based on some valuation methodology, as opposed to being a figure plucked out by Wang Bin from the air.

56     Given that the figure was provided or inserted by Ho Chi Man, the 2nd Defendant’s own accountant, and assented to by the 2nd Defendant when he executed the 30 January Letter, it would have been important for 2nd Defendant to have called Ho Chi Man as a witness to explain how the figure was derived and came to be inserted in the 30 January Letter – specifically, whether it came from Wang Bin, or whether it was based on the Defendants’ own internal valuation of the Shares. This was especially so as PW1 Tang had also given testimony that 2nd Defendant had himself valued the shares at $460,000, which approximated the sum of $467,165.00 claimed by the Plaintiff (see \[50\] above). The 2nd Defendant had admitted on the stand that Ho Chi Man is still under NSC Capital’s employment. [^46] Despite all these, the 2nd Defendant chose not to call Ho Chi Man as a witness at trial. In my mind, this warranted the drawing of an adverse inference against the 2nd Defendant under section 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, 1997 Rev Ed) that Ho Chi Man’s evidence would not have been favorable to the 2nd Defendant.

### Whether the 30 January Letter was procured by duress?

57     One piece of evidence that I relied on in coming to the conclusion that the parties were _ad idem_ as to the Purchase Price of the Shares was the 30 January Letter. The 2nd Defendant, however, argued that the 30 January Letter should not be given any weight as it was executed by the 2nd Defendant under duress.

58     There are two elements which must be fulfilled for a claim in duress to be made up. In _Tam Tak Chuen v Khairul bin Abdul Rahman_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 240</span> (“_Tam Tak Chuen_”), Prakash J, citing Lord Scarman in _Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation_ <span class="citation">\[1983\] 1 AC 366</span> at 400, noted that there were two elements in the wrong of duress:

> (a)     pressure amounting to compulsion of the will of the victim, and

> (b)     the illegitimacy of the pressure exerted.

59     A claim of duress is traditionally analyzed based on the recognized categories of duress: physical duress (to the person), duress of goods and economic duress. While the different categories of duress may admit of different specific requirements, the two basic requirements set out in _Tam Tak Chuen_ are the same: See _The Law of Contracts in Singapore_ (Andrew Phang Boon Leong General Editor, Academy Publishing, 2012) (“**_The Law of Contracts in Singapore_**”) at \[12.013\].

60     In the present case, the 2nd Defendant argued that as a result of the duress exerted on him, the 30 January Letter should not be accorded any evidential weight[^47]. The category of duress pleaded by the 2nd Defendant appeared to be physical duress or duress to person. While duress in the context of the 2nd Defendant’s defence was not raised by way of a vitiating factor, but rather to undermine the evidentiary value of the 30 January Letter, the principles of duress set out in _Tam Tak Chuen_ would continue to be a useful framework for assessing whether the 30 January Letter should be accorded any evidential weight.

#### Whether illegitimate pressure proven

61     It is well established that it is insufficient to show that pressure was asserted; the pressure must further be shown to be illegitimate. As noted in _The Law of Contracts in Singapore_ at \[12.012\], “when considering the applicability or otherwise of duress, the importance of the _factual matrix_ of a particular case cannot be overstated….. It is axiomatic that the _facts showing duress must be proved_”. An analysis of the facts of the case under examination is thus important when determining if duress has been made out.

62     Turning to the facts, the 2nd Defendant’s account of the pressure asserted on him is contained in paragraphs \[18\] – \[23\] of his affidavit. These were stated in very general terms, the key fact allegation being that the Wang Bin had turned up at NSC Capital’s premises without notification and started “hurling verbal abuses and threats at \[the 2nd Defendant\] and loudly demanded that \[the 2nd Defendant\] sign a document”. When the 2nd Defendant refused to do so, Wang Bin “resumed hurling verbal abuses and threats at \[the 2nd Defendant\] and again loudly demanded that \[the 2nd Defendant\] sign the letter”. Wang Bin also “threatened to hit \[the 2nd Defendant\] and beat \[the 2nd Defendant\].”[^48]

63     It is trite that the burden is on the party pleading duress to prove that illegitimate pressure was asserted, by establishing the supporting facts. From an evidential viewpoint, the 2nd Defendant’s contention that physical duress was exerted on him, in particular that Wang Bin had threatened to hit him and beat him up, had, in my view, very weak evidentiary support. While the Defendant did call one Balvinda Kaur D/O Jaswant Singh (“**DW2 Balvinda**”) who testified that Wang Bin “hurled verbal abuses and threats at Paul”, was “very aggressive, rude and abusive”, and acted “like a thug or gangster”, DW2 Balvinda was candid in stating that she could not really understand what Wang Bin was saying as the latter spoke in Mandarin[^49]. It followed that 2nd Defendant’s contention that Wang Bin threatened to hit him or beat him up on 30 January 2019 was based on no more than his bare assertion, and insufficient to discharge the burden of proof required of him.

64     I was prepared to accept that Wang Bin in all likelihood did raise his voice and speak in an angry and aggressive tone to the 2nd Defendant at the 30 January Meeting, as he did at the 6 May Meeting. However, speaking loudly and angrily _per se_ would not amount to an illegitimate threat. Thus, if the 2nd Defendant refused to commit to a timeline for the payment of the Purchase Price and that in turn caused Wang Bin to speak in an increasingly loud and aggressive tone, that would not necessarily amount to an illegitimate threat. The 2nd Defendant struck me as a sophisticated businessman who was not likely to have been easily rattled by a disgruntled investor like Wang Bin. The mere raising of his voice by Wang Bin was unlikely, in my view, to have frightened the 2nd Defendant into executing a document he was unwilling to sign, not least when there were other persons in the premises on both occasions from whom he could have sought assistance. Indeed, the 6 May Transcripts showed that Wang Bin’s aggressive tone and agitated demeanor at the 6 May 2019 meeting had no impact whatsoever on the 2nd Defendant, and did not cause the 2nd Defendant to give in to any of Wang Bin’s demands[^50].

#### Whether the terms contained in the 30 January Letter were manifestly disadvantageous to the Defendants

65     A threat has also been described as illegitimate where the terms secured as a result of the threat of lawful action were so ‘manifestly disadvantageous’ to the complainant as to make it unconscionable for the defendant to retain the benefit of them: see _Tam Tak Chuen’s_ at \[22\]. Applying this test, I also could not come to the conclusion that any pressure applied on the 2nd Defendant was illegitimate. While a purchase price of $467,165.00 at first blush appeared to be a large sum given the suggestions that NSC Capital was not profitable and in some financial difficulties, the financial position of the company was never clearly established at trial. The accounts of NSC Capital were never produced at trial to show what the exact valuation of NSC Capital was, and specifically, that the valuation of the 30% shareholding of the company at $467,165.00 was manifestly excessive and disadvantageous to the 2nd Defendant. Indeed, in the 6 May Transcripts, the 2nd Defendant expressed confidence in turning the company back to profit in a year’s time. Separately, there also appeared to be various profitable accounts of the company which 2nd Defendant had transferred to a holding company called “Menon” which allegedly had assets in the region of $1,000,000.00: see \[39\] above. Absent the relevant accounts, any conclusion that the deal was manifestly disadvantageous to 2nd Defendant would be solely based on conjecture.

66     In the final analysis, having regard to the fact the contents of the alleged threats were based on the 2nd Defendant’s bare assertion, and the 2nd Defendant had further not shown that the terms of the 30 January letters were manifestly disadvantageous to the Defendants, I found that 2nd Defendant had not discharged his burden of showing that illegitimate pressure was asserted on him. The first element of proving a wrong of duress had not been fulfilled.

#### Whether there was compulsion of will

67     Separately, I found that the second element of a wrong in duress was also not established, in that 2nd Defendant’s will was not overborne when he executed the 30 January Letter. As Prakash J noted in _Tam Tak Chuen_ (citing _Pao On v Lau You Long_ <span class="citation">\[1980\] AC 614</span>), the factors that the court would consider in determining if there had been a compulsion in the will of the victim were:

> (a)     Whether the person alleged to have been coerced did or did not protest;

> (b)     Whether, at the time of the alleged coercion, the victim did or did not have an alternative course open to him;

> (c)     Whether he was independently advised; and

> (d)     Whether after entering into the contract he took any steps to avoid it.

68     While Wang Bin may very well have behaved aggressively on 30 and 31 January 2019, I found it difficult to conclude that there was compulsion of the will of the 2nd Defendant on both occasions. I considered the following:

69      Whether 2nd Defendant protested. First, I agreed with Plaintiff’s Counsel that there was no objective evidence that the 2nd Defendant had severely protested. The evidence relating to the contents of the conversations between the 2nd Defendant, Plaintiff and Wang Bin on 30 January 2019 was based on the conflicting accounts of the 2nd Defendant on one hand, and Plaintiff and Wang Bin on the other. While DW2 Balvinda deposed in her affidavit that 2nd Defendant had told Wang Bin that _he refused to sign the letter_, it was unclear to me how DW2 Balvinda could be sure as to what was communicated to Wang Bin when, by her own admission, she could not fully understand Chinese[^51]. DW2 Balvinda also showed herself to have a propensity to tailor her evidence to assist the Defendants’ case. For instance, she stated in her affidavit that the 2nd Defendant “looked really scared” when Wang Bin hurled abuses and threats at him[^52]. However, when probed during cross-examination, she started to water down her testimony by stating that the 2nd Defendant looked “a bit scared”, and thereafter, “a little scared”, but that it “wasn’t life threatening”[^53].

70     On this issue, the only objective fact was that the 2nd Defendant had executed the 30 January Letter _first_ on 30 January 2019 when Wang Bin visited his office. The very next day, on 31 January 2019, Wang Bin and Plaintiff went to the office _again_ and requested the 2nd Defendant to execute a revised version of the letter which contained the Plaintiff’s bank account details and a timeline for payment. On the second occasion, 2nd Defendant executed the letter _again_. The 2nd Defendant was not alone in the office on both occasions, and could have asked for assistance if he were adamant that he would not sign the letters. Considering the factual matrix as a whole, I did not think the 2nd Defendant signed the 30 January Letter under serious protest on both occasions.

71      Availability of alternative options. Secondly, I noted that there were people with the 2nd Defendant, including students and/or clients, in what was not a big office on both occasions. The 2nd Defendant could have walked away; he was never restrained by Wang Bin[^54]. This was confirmed at trial by DW2 Balvinda, who testified that while the discussions on 30 January 2019 were heated, they were not “life threatening”, and that 2nd Defendant could have “walked out” if he wanted to:

>   
| 

_Notes of Evidence, Day 2, at p. 190_

Q On all 3 occasions from your point of view was Paul fearful for his life or was there a life threatening--- Was it a life threatening situation for Paul on all those 3 occasions?

A I could see that he was a bit scared. _A bit scared. A little scared_. Right. _It wasn’t life threatening, lah_, he was afraid.

Q _Could he have walked out of each of these 3 situation if he had wanted to walk out---walk away?_

_A He could. \[Emphasis added\]_

 |

  
  

72     Further, as the 6 May 2019 meeting showed, Paul had the ability to call for support when confronted with threats. Indeed, at the 6 May Meeting, security personnel and even the police were activated and arrived at the premises, though the 2nd Defendant did not eventually request them to take any action[^55]. There was no reason to think the 2nd Defendant could not similarly have called for the same reinforcement if he felt he was in danger of being assaulted on 30 January or 31 January 2019. Quite clearly, the 2nd Defendant had alternative courses open to him when he was asked to sign the 30 January Letter.

73      Whether steps were taken to avoid the contract. Lastly, the 2nd Defendant never took steps to avoid the contract. After signing the 30 January letter, when asked to sign the letter again on 31 January with the account details inserted, he obliged. In addition, instead of trying to get out of the 30 January Letter, the 2nd Defendant appeared to have done nothing between 31 January 2019 and 5 May 2019 to get out of the Oral Agreement and the 30 January Letter. To the contrary, in the 6 May Transcripts, he asked for more time to “make the right arrangements … at NSC to ensure that the shares can translate into the cash for \[Wang Bin\]” (see \[43\] above; timestamp \[10:58\]). He just needed more time because of the litigation, audit issues and the need to navigate Singapore laws.

### Conclusion on whether purchase price of $467,165 was agreed

74     In summary, I found, _on a balance of probabilities_, that the figure of $467,165.00 was already discussed and agreed in or around November 2018 in light of: (a) the 2nd Defendant’s reference to the figure in the email to PW1 Tang on 28 November 2018; (b) the figure being volunteered or inserted by the 2nd Defendant’s accountant Ho Chi Man, whom the 2nd Defendant chose not to call to disprove the Plaintiff’s allegation that the figure was voluntarily provided by Ho Chi Man; (c) the 2nd Defendant’s execution of the 30 January Letter, confirming the valuation of the Shares at $467,165.00; and (d) the conversations between the parties as captured by the 6 May Transcripts, in which the 2nd Defendant did not deny that he had previously promised to acquire the Shares at the Purchase Price, and asking instead for time to resolve the legal and regulatory issues first.

### No valid agreement as price of Shares indeterminate?

75     For completeness, I should deal with the argument raised in the Defendant’s closing submissions that the price of the Shares was indeterminate. This argument seemingly stemmed from Wang Bin’s testimony at trial that he had always been discussing the sale of the Shares with 2nd Defendant at a _price range_ of between $1 and $1.50. According to Wang Bin’s testimony at trial, the price of $467,165.00 was only finalized at the 30 January 2019 meeting. There was thus no certainty of terms required for there to be a valid contract in the period in or around _November 2018_, which was the Plaintiff’s pleaded case.

76     I would note at the outset that this argument has been foreclosed as a matter of the 2nd Defendant’s pleadings. In the Defence, the 2nd Defendant’s pleaded case was simply that there was a valid binding contract for the sale of the Shares, but at $1.00 as stated in the 2018 Share Transfer Form: see \[22\] above. The Defendant never pleaded in his Defence that there was no valid agreement on the grounds of lack of certainty of terms. It was never part of the Defendant’s pleaded defence that what was discussed and agreed was for the Shares to be sold at a range of between $1.00 to $1.50, which was insufficiently certain to give rise to a binding contract.

77     Even if I were wrong on this point, I had found above that even if a price range was originally discussed between the parties, the party did eventually reach an _oral_ agreement on the sale price of the shares at $467,165.00: see paragraph \[74\] above. The agreed price was then further confirmed in writing via the 30 January Letter. While the 30 January Letter was executed by the 2nd Defendant on behalf of 1st Defendant, it nevertheless suggested that the 2nd Defendant had assented to the valuation of the Shares at $467,165.00.

78     Admittedly, Wang Bin testified that the figure of $467,165.00 was only agreed at the 30 January meeting. This testimony must however be viewed against the backdrop that Wang Bin is not a legally trained person – see _ARS v ARTS_. He is a PRC national, unfamiliar with English, and with Singapore law and regulations. Undue emphasis must not be placed on his choice of words. The fact that Wang Bin said they only agreed on the $467,165.00 figure on 30 January did not necessarily mean that there was no verbal agreement on $467,165.00 before that. Given his background, he may have understood that parties would only be deemed to have agreed on something if it were finally reduced into _writing_.

## Conclusion

79     In conclusion, for the reasons summarized under paragraph \[74\] above, I found, _on a balance of probabilities_, that the Plaintiff had agreed to sell, and the 2nd Defendant had agreed to purchase, the Shares in or around November 2018 at a purchase price of $467,165.00.

80     Based on the foregoing, I therefore awarded judgement for Plaintiff against 2nd Defendant in the sum of $467,165.00 plus interest at 5.33% p.a. from date of writ to date of judgment, and costs.

81     The Plaintiff’s claim against the 1st Defendant was dismissed with costs.
