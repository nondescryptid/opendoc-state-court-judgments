Harassment – Protection Order

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/CJTA 1/2019.\]

4 December 2019

### District Judge Josephine Kang:

1       This is an Originating Summons (“OS”) for a Protection Order (“PO”) under s 12 of the Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”). The OS proceeded for trial. At the end of the trial, I dismissed the application. Dissatisfied, the Applicant applied for leave to appeal against my order of dismissal. Upon hearing parties, I granted leave to appeal. My full grounds of decision are set out below.

## Introduction

2       The Applicant is the managing director of a company known as WeR1 Consultants Pte Ltd (“WeR1”).

3       WeR1 is a financial communications company whose primary business involves raising the profile of listed and unlisted companies to (i) financial and business media and (2) the investment community[^1]. WeR1 also provides litigation public relations services[^2], which includes advising their clients on media perception, potential questions from the media and how best to answer these questions[^3].

4       The Applicant was 59 years old at the material time. He was the founder of WeR1, which was set up in year 2000[^4]. Prior to that, he had worked as a foreign correspondent with Reuters for nine years and subsequently, as an equity analyst for about five years. As the managing director of WeR1, he meets prospective clients, provides direction to junior staff, edits drafts and communications with clients, handles media queries, provides strategic review of presentation slides and media training for corporate leaders before they appear for interview or briefing[^5]. According to WeR1’s website, the Applicant was a ‘highly experienced communications expert who is regularly consulted by corporate leaders in the region for crisis communications and complex corporate buyouts’[^6].

5       The Respondent, who was 35 years old at the material time, was an ex-employee of WeR1. Prior to his employment with WeR1, he had studied and worked in the United States. He returned to Singapore in late 2017 and did ad hoc freelancing writing projects until he secured a job with WeR1[^7].

## Background

6       The Respondent started work with WeR1 on 18 May 2018. Shortly after he commenced employment, the Respondent had a run-in with two interns. This led to a meeting on 28 May 2018 between the Respondent, the Applicant, the HR manager and one Sarinderjit Kaur (“Shindy”), the Plaintiff’s wife and co-director.

7       After that meeting, the Respondent decided to resign with 2 weeks’ notice, as required under his employment contract. He notified Shindy of his intentions via whatsapp on 29 May 2018 and indicated that he would hand in his formal resignation letter the next day. Unfortunately, the exchange between parties escalated. Shindy informed the Respondent that WeR1 had accepted his resignation via whatsapp and instructed him to return the company’s entry and transport cards by 5pm that day. The Respondent complied[^8].

8       After his resignation, the Respondent sent the following emails:

> (a)     An email dated 30 May 2018 to the Applicant and his ex-colleagues at WeR1[^9].

> (b)     An email dated 31 May 2018 to the Applicant[^10].

9       On 31 May 2018, the Respondent lodged a claim with the Ministry of Manpower against WeR1 for salary in-lieu of notice.

10     On 4 June 2018, WeR1’s solicitors sent a letter of demand to the Respondent, who received the letter on 7 June 2018. This letter warned the Respondent to cease and desist from communicating with WeR1 or its staff, failing which legal proceedings would be commenced against him[^11].

11     On 7 June 2018, the Respondent posted adverse reviews of WeR1 on their Facebook page and on Google Reviews[^12]. Using his Google Plus account, he created a blog entitled “WeR1 Consultants” and posted a post entitled “A Cautionary Tale” on that blog[^13]. The blog post’s contents were largely similar to the contents of the Respondent’s adverse reviews. At about 2.18pm, the Respondent also sent an SMS with the following contents to the Applicant: _“Btw…check ur facebook page tonight_??![]([2019] SGDC 0276_Image/[2019] SGDC 0276_image1.png)_[^14]_”.

12     Shortly after the Respondent posted his review on WeR1’s Facebook page, the HR manager from WeR1 disabled its review tab[^15]. On 8 June 2018, the Applicant deleted WeR1’s Twitter page, deactivated his personal Facebook page and put his LinkedIn page on ‘private’ mode. The Applicant was also notified by his ex-employee, one Ms. Eunice Lua that the Respondent had tried to contact her through LinkedIn for the purposes of obtaining information to litigate against WeR1[^16].

13     On or around 9 June 2018, the Respondent deleted his adverse reviews on Google Reviews on his own accord[^17]. He also deactivated his Google Plus account at the same time. He assumed that he could remove his blog post by doing so[^18]. He then sent an email to the Applicant to inform him that he had removed the adverse reviews and that he wished to resolve the dispute as soon as possible[^19]. On the same day, the Applicant took steps to block further communications from the Respondent’s e-mail accounts[^20].

14     Between 9th June 2018 and 18th June 2018, there was no further communication originating from the Respondent. On 12th June 2018, the Applicant reported the Respondent’s blog to the blog administrators for harassment and/or bullying. On 18 June 2018, the Applicant commenced this action against the Respondent.

## The Applicant’s application & the proceedings

15     The Applicant alleged that the Respondent had contravened ss 3 and 4 of the POHA and sought a PO under s 12 of the Act on the following terms: that the Respondent be prohibited from doing the following things in relation to the Applicant:

> (a)     Using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior and/or making/publishing any threatening, abusive or insulting communication (including but not limited to any words, image, message, expression, symbol) causing harassment, alarm and/or distress to the Applicant;

> (b)     Using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior and/or making/publishing any threatening, abusive or insulting communication (including but not limited to any words, image, message, expression, symbol) which is heard, seen or otherwise perceived to cause harassment, alarm and/or distress to the Applicant.

16     The Applicant also sought an order to prohibit any persons from publishing or continuing to publish the reviews posted by the Respondent.

17     Upon commencing the action, the Applicant applied for and obtained an expedited protection order (“EPO”) against the Respondent. Thereafter, several rounds of pre-trial conferences (‘PTC’) were held for this case.

18     During the PTC dated 13 August 2018, the Respondent was informed that his blog post remained live even though he had deactivated his account. The Respondent accordingly informed the Court that (i) he had removed all the offending communications and (ii) if anything remained online, he was prepared to remove it later that day[^21]. He accordingly took down the blog post on that date[^22]. The Respondent failed to appease the Applicant, who took issue on two counts.

19     First, the Applicant was unhappy that the Respondent had failed to remove his review on WeR1’s Facebook account. After the PTC, the Applicant informed his colleague to enable WeR1’s Facebook review tab again, so that the Respondent could access and remove his review. However, as the Respondent failed to do so after two days, the Applicant instructed his colleague to hide the review tab again. During cross-examination, the Applicant conceded that the Respondent may not have been informed that WeR1’s review tab had been reactivated to facilitate his removal of his review[^23].

20     Secondly, even though the blog post was no longer visible, the Applicant was unhappy that google searches against the defunct blog continued to throw up the following caption “_Why WeR1 Consultants is the worst PR agency in town_”[^24]. The Respondent subsequently wrote to Google and blogger.com on 20 November 2018 and 4 December 2018 respectively, requesting them to remove the links[^25].

21     The parties failed to reach a compromise and the Respondent proceeded to file his affidavit. In his affidavit, the Respondent took the position that (i) his communications did not amount to any form of harassment (ii) the communications did not cause any harassment, alarm or distress to the Applicant (iii) there was no likelihood of a further contravention and (iv) it was neither just nor equitable for the Court to grant a PO in the circumstances.

## The Law

22     Section 12 POHA empowers the court to make a PO if the criteria set out in s 12(2) POHA is satisfied on a balance of probabilities:

> (a)     The respondent has contravened section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 in respect of the victim;

> (b)     The said contravention is likely to continue, or the respondent is likely to commit a contravention of section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 in respect of the victim; and

> (c)     It is just and equitable in all the circumstances.

23     In _Benber Dayao Yu v Jacter Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 92</span> at \[27\], Justice See Kee Oon applied the following test when deciding whether to grant a protection order:

> (a)     The first stage was to establish whether the respondent had contravened ss 3(1) and 4(1) POHA by examining the nature of the words or behavior in question.

> (b)     The second stage was to consider whether any defence can apply. At this point, the inquiry is into whether what has been found to be harassing conduct was nonetheless reasonable conduct in the circumstances.

Finally, the court considers whether it is fair and equitable in all the circumstances to grant the PO under s 12.

## The Analytical Framework

24     To determine if a PO was justified in this case, I applied the following analytical framework:

> a)     Whether s 12(2)(a) POHA was satisfied, i.e.:

>> (i)       Did the Respondent’s actions/communications offend ss 3 or 4 of the POHA?

>> (ii)       Was there a reasonable defence i.e. was the harassing conduct reasonable in the circumstances?

> (b)     Whether s 12(2)(b) POHA was satisfied i.e. was the contravention likely to continue or a further contravention imminent?

> (c)     Whether s 12(2)(c) POHA was satisfied i.e. was it just and equitable for a PO to be imposed.

## Issue (a)   Did the Respondent’s actions/communications offend s 3 or s 4 POHA?

25     In paragraph 22 of his supporting affidavit, the Applicant categorised the offending communication into four categories[^26]:

> (a)     Category I: Instant messages exchanged between the Respondent and (i) Shindy (ii) the Applicant (iii) Weina (WeR1’s intern) and (iv) May (WeR1’s HR manager) between 1 May 2018 and 29 May 2018;

> (b)     Category II: E-mail messages sent by the Respondent to (i) the Applicant and (ii) the employees and interns of WeR1;

> (c)     Category III: Online reviews posted by the Respondent on (i) WeR1’s Facebook page and (ii) Google; and

> (d)     Category IV: the Respondent’s blog post entitled “A Cautionary Tale” on http://wer1consultants.blogspot.com.

#### Category I: The Instant Messages

26     In his supporting affidavit, the Applicant exhibited a stack of instant messages[^27]. In my assessment, most of these communications were irrelevant, as they were neither sent to the Applicant nor contained any threatening, insulting or abusive comments about the Applicant.

27     Where the messages were sent directly to the Applicant, I did not find the contents to be threatening, insulting or abusive, with the exception of an SMS dated 7 June 2018. In that SMS, the Respondent had asked the Applicant to check his Facebook page that night (see paragraph 11 above). On that same day, the Respondent posted a series of online reviews and a blog containing adverse feedback on WeR1 and which also made specific references to the Applicant. In my judgment, the Applicant had sent this SMS with the intention of harassing the Applicant. I will return to this point later in my judgment.

#### Category II: The email messages

28     The Applicant took issue with three emails sent by the Respondent. I will deal with each in turn.

## \[a\]   Email dated 30 May 2018

29     The Respondent had sent this email to the Applicant and his seven ex-colleagues in WeR1[^28]. The Applicant took the position that the Respondent was trying to harass him and Shindy through his abusive email, and sought to vent his grievances before every employee of WeR1. The Respondent disagreed that the email contained any threatening, abusive or insulting communication. In his view, his action was entirely within reason and acceptable human behavior.

30     Most of the contents in this email did not specifically address the Applicant, except for paragraphs 21, 23 to 25, which I will examine in detail.

31     Paragraph 21 of the email stated as follows “_The bottom line is this, kk… I repeat: this place is too dysfunctional for me to stay. If you want to be so enraged by such a feedback – to the point of even being willing to break the law, then well, you go figure what is really wrong here’._ On the face of it, this paragraph seemed to suggest that the Respondent had accused the Applicant of breaking the law. However, I agreed with the Respondent that, read in the context of the entire email, the Respondent was referring to WeR1’s refusal to pay him his notice salary, which he believed he was legally entitled to receive[^29].

32     Paragraph 23 of the email stated this: “_but it’s the principle of it. If I cannot let you get away with this time with this, its for your own good. You need to learn._” During the hearing, the Applicant testified that he was deeply offended to be told by a much younger colleague, in front of the other interns, that he needed to learn a lesson[^30]. In my view, even though this was unpleasant, this paragraph did not contain any threatening, abusive or insulting contents.

33     Paragraph 24 was specifically directed to the Applicant. Part of its contents stated as follows “_now, I will not publicize this to your clients no matter what…_” I found that this was a veiled threat to ‘publicise’ the dispute to WeR1’s clients, which would affect the Applicant’s livelihood.

34     In paragraph 25, the Respondent wrote this ‘_KK… life can be very simple. I mean no ill intentions - - actually, what I am telling you to do now is even a matter of course – both legally and professionally. It is very clear .. or it should be, to any educated mind who is being very childish here_.” The Applicant was insulted by this comment, as the Respondent had accused him of being childish in front of interns who were 25 to 35 years his junior[^31]. I agreed that this was a mild insult.

## \[b\]   Email dated 31 May 2018

35     On 31 May 2018, the Applicant received another email from the Respondent[^32]. This Respondent had sent this email only to the Applicant using a Yahoo email account. In my view, this email contained several instances of threatening and insulting communication.

> (a)     In paragraph two of the email, the Respondent insulted the Applicant by suggesting that he was doing stupid things with ‘full prescience of the consequences’. In the same paragraph, he subsequently proclaimed that, armed with ‘official documentation’ from MOM, he could scan and paste the ‘government edict’ on the Applicant’s Jobstreet or Facebook page, and send it to all the Applicant’s clients – but he would not. Although the Respondent had qualified his statement by stating that he would not publicise the dispute to the Applicant’s clients, I found this to be a veiled threat, taking into account the fact that this was the second time the Respondent had specifically mentioned this possibility.

> (b)     In paragraph four, the Respondent once again suggested that he could, but would not launch an argument that he had been unlawfully dismissed on grounds of his disability (i.e. due to his autism disorder). Again, I found this to be a veiled threat.

> (c)     In paragraph five, the Respondent insulted the Applicant by suggesting that he was deceiving himself.

> (d)     In paragraph seven, the Respondent insulted the Applicant by stating that his arguments were effectively non-arguments, which ‘any idiot’ could say. He then went on to insult the Applicant by writing ‘_KK, seriously, there are some intelligent children I have seen who don’t even argue like that about anything._’

> (e)     In paragraph eight, the Respondent insulted the Applicant again by writing that pig-headedness was the crux of all the Applicant’s problems.

36     In my view, taken as a whole, the email dated 31 May 2018 contained threats to harm the Applicant’s livelihood and reputation. It also insulted the Applicant by suggesting that he was pig-headed and a self-deceiving person who made unintelligent arguments.

## \[c\]   Email dated 9 June 2018

37     The Applicant also took issue with the email dated 9 June 2018[^33]. In my view, this email was toned down and relatively conciliatory in nature. I did not agree with the Applicant that the contents of this email were threatening, abusive or insulting in any way.

#### Category III and IV: The online reviews and blogposts

38     The Applicant took issue with the series of reviews and blog post created by the Applicant on 7 June 2018[^34]:

> (a)     A review on WeR1’s Facebook account;

> (b)     A Google Review; and

> (c)     A blogpost on a Blog titled “A Cautionary Tale”.

39     In paragraph 45 of his affidavit, the Respondent admitted that he had submitted a similar review on Yelp but this not published[^35].

40     In my view, while most of the contents in these posts were generally directed against WeR1, the Respondent also made specific reference to the Applicant. In the reviews, the Respondent referred to the Applicant by his acronym, KK. In the blogpost, the Applicant specifically spelt out the Applicant’s full name.

41     I found that the posts contained insulting comments on the Applicant:

> (a)     In paragraph three of the blog post, the Respondent referred to WeR1 as ‘mafia-sque’ and in paragraph four, the Applicant’s name was spelt out in full and he was referred to as the ‘godfather’.

> (b)     In paragraph four, the Applicant was portrayed as a person who:

>> (i)       ‘_contradicted himself when it suited the whims of his mood’_,

>> (ii)       ‘_would go out of his way to tout his own horns_’.

>> (iii)       ‘_fancied himself as some sort of guru and purveyor of trade secrets’_ whom the interns should learn from.

42     According to the Respondent, he was upset with WeR1 for resorting to lawyer letters to ‘silence’ him and had created these posts to ventilate his frustration. In my view, however, his intentions were not as benign.

43     On 7 June 2018, the Respondent had specifically sent a message to the Applicant, notifying him to check WeR1’s Facebook that night. On the same day, these posts were created. In my view, the Respondent had intentionally created these posts which contained insulting comments on the Applicant to harass him. Further, he had deliberately brought these posts to the Applicant’s attention by notifying him through SMS.

44     Taken in totality, I found that the Respondent’s communication had descended into harassment, particularly when he resorted to posting the insulting comments online on multiple social media platforms.

#### Did the Respondent’s communication cause harassment, alarm or distress to the Applicant?

45     The Applicant’s evidence was that the Respondent’s communication had left him shaken. He asserted that the stress had caused him sleepless nights and heart palpitations. He was uncertain and distressed as to whether such incidents would recur in future. He felt like he was being put on the edge all the time and helpless. The Applicant felt that the Respondent was threatening his livelihood by threatening to publicise their dispute to his clients[^36].

46     I accepted that the Respondent’s communications, specifically the online posts, would have alarmed the Applicant to a certain extent. Before 7 June 2018, the Applicant had blocked the Respondent on various social media platforms. He had also disengaged himself from the Respondent. However, the Respondent persisted and continued to send the Applicant unwelcome communication through instant messages and other email accounts. Even when a letter of demand was sent to the Respondent through the Applicant’s solicitors, it did not deter him. Instead, the Respondent escalated the conflict to various social media platforms. The Applicant then received news from an ex-colleague, Ms. Eunice Lua, to notify him that the Respondent had reached out to her as well.

47     I found that the Respondent’s series of emails, instant messages and online reviews would have conveyed an impression that the Respondent was persistent in his attempts to harass and embarrass the Applicant. I also found that the Applicant had reasons to be alarmed when he came to know that the Respondent had contacted Ms. Eunice Lua. In the context of the Respondent’s previous veiled threats to publicise the matter to WeR1’s clients, this would have compounded the Applicant’s fear that the Respondent was indeed taking steps to escalate and broadcast the dispute to his business associates, which would affect his reputation and livelihood. I therefore accepted that the Applicant would have been harassed and alarmed by the Respondent’s behavior.

## Issue b:   Was the Respondent’s conduct reasonable?

48     The Respondent argued that his conduct was reasonable in the circumstances. He felt that he was a victim of grave injustice and he wanted to prevent other people from suffering the same fate. He was merely stating the truth when he said that WeR1 was the worst employer he had worked for[^37]. In his view, he was merely carrying out a ‘public service’ by advising prospective employees to steer clear away from WeR1[^38].

49     During the trial, the Respondent testified that ever since he resigned, WeR1 had threatened to sue him[^39]. His impression was that the Applicant was trying to browbeat him into withdrawing his employment claim[^40]. He admitted that he had posted the reviews and blog post to ventilate his frustrations when he received the letter of demand. However, on the same day, he realised that this was not appropriate and he proceeded to remove the posts[^41].

50     Whilst I found that certain aspects of the emails dated 30 and 31 May 2018 contained insulting comments on the Applicant, I would have been prepared to accept these as a largely harmless, emotional response to his employment dispute with WeR1 – if he had stopped at that point. Unfortunately, the Respondent went further than that.

51     The Respondent went beyond the boundaries of reasonable conduct when he published the dispute online on multiple social media platforms. By then, it was no longer the rant of a disgruntled employee. The Respondent had descended into tit-for-tat and he clearly wanted to strike back at WeR1 and specifically, the Applicant.

52     In the premises, I found that the Respondent’s actions had gone beyond the ambit of reasonable conduct. All things considered, I found that the Applicant had satisfied s 12(2)(a) of the POHA.

## Issue c:   Was the contravention continuing or a further contravention imminent?

53     In order to obtain a PO, s 12(2)(b) POHA requires the Applicant to show the contravention was likely to continue or that a further contravention was imminent. On a balance of probabilities, I found that the Applicant had failed to prove this point.

54     It was not disputed that after the email dated 9 June 2018, the Respondent had stopped all direct communications with the Applicant[^42]. The Facebook Review was hidden shortly after it was posted. The Respondent’s evidence was that he had removed the Google review within two days after posting it. This was not challenged by the Applicant[^43]. At the same time, he also deactivated the Google account which he had used to post his blog. Hence, for all intents and purposes, he had ceased his acts of harassment by 9 June 2018.

55     Although the Respondent’s remained live even after he deactivated his Google Plus account, he immediately took it down upon being notified of its continued existence online. I was prepared to accept that he was genuinely unaware that the blog post remained online even after he had deactivated his account. It was also not disputed that as at the date of the trial, the blog was no longer accessible online[^44].

56     The Applicant’s position, however, was that there was continuing harassment as there were still traces of the adverse reviews online:

> (a)     The Respondent’s adverse review on WeR1’s Facebook page; and

> (b)     A cached link to the blog page containing the adverse review.

57     The Respondent’s response was that (i) he could not access his review on WeR1’s Facebook page as the reviews tab had been deactivated and (ii) he had performed all reasonable steps to remove the cached link to his deactivated blog, upon being notified of its presence.

58     I accepted the Respondent’s explanation that he could not access the reviews tab on WeR1’s Facebook page. Even though the Applicant had previously instructed his office to reactivate the reviews tab to allow the Respondent to remove his adverse review, he had done so without informing the Respondent. I accepted the Respondent’s argument that there was no reason for the Respondent to have only removed the blog post but not the Facebook review[^45].

59     As for the cached link to the deactivated blog, it was not disputed that this was effectively a dead link[^46]. Whilst the cache itself did reveal a caption stating ‘_Why WeR1 consultants is the worst PR agency in town_’, this comment was not insulting, threatening or abusive vis-à-vis the Applicant. Hence, strictly speaking, the Respondent was not obliged to take any steps to remove this cached link from appearing on internet search results. However, he did so[^47]. This, in my view, suggested that the Respondent was trying his level best to resolve the matter and to appease the Applicant. Unfortunately, the Applicant was not appeased. He insisted that the Respondent could still do more to remove the cached link, even though he was not personally aware as to what else could have been done to effect that[^48].

60     Assessing the evidence in totality, I found that the Respondent was unlikely to continue or attempt to further contravene s 3 or s 4 POHA on a balance of probabilities for the following reasons:

> (a)     As early as 9 June 2018, the Respondent had taken steps to remove the adverse reviews on his own accord;

> (b)     His email dated 9 June 2018 was relatively conciliatory in nature, indicating his intention to resolve the matter amicably;

> (c)     There was no evidence that there had been any further offending communications made by the Respondent in respect of the Applicant since 9 June 2018;

> (d)     Upon being notified that the blog remained live, he immediately took down the blog on 13 August 2018;

> (e)     Upon being notified that a cached link to the blog post, accompanied by a caption, showed up on Google search results, the Respondent took active steps to mitigate the situation by:

>> (i)       requesting Google to remove the link on 20 November 2018; and

>> (ii)       emailing the web administrator at blogger.com to remove the link on 4 December 2018.

61     All things considered, the Respondent’s conduct post 9 June 2018 pointed towards an attempt to contain rather than to perpetuate the conflict. In the premises, I found that the harassment was unlikely to continue. I also found that a future contravention was unlikely.

## Issue d:   Would granting a PO be fair and equitable in the circumstances?

62     In the light of my finding that the contraventions were unlikely to continue and a further contravention unlikely, the Applicant’s application for a PO would fail. However, for completeness, I gave my findings on the remaining issue.

63     In assessing whether a PO is fair and equitable, the court takes into regard the following factors:

> (a)     The nature and seriousness of the harassing conduct;

> (b)     The purpose and motive behind the conduct in question;

> (c)     The impact of the conduct on the victim and the degree of adverse emotional or psychological harm suffered;

> (d)     The degree to which the harassing conduct had been made known to the public;

> (e)     Whether the victim had the means to mitigate or avoid the harassing conduct;

> (f)     Whether the person behind the conduct had made genuine efforts to ensure that the conduct would not be misconstrued or misunderstood; and

> (g)     The ordinary instances of daily living that may be expected to be tolerated by reasonable persons.

64     While I accepted that the Respondent’s communications and conduct had descended into harassment, the offending communications had stopped by 9 June 2018 and the remnants of any online posts/reviews removed by December 2018. Currently, only the Facebook review remained but any negative impact which may possibly arise from that review had been mitigated by the Applicant’s swift actions of hiding it from public view.

65     Even whilst I accepted that the fiasco had, to an extent, alarmed the Applicant, I did not think that it should cause any major emotional or psychological impact on him. One of the Applicant’s main concerns were that the Respondent would besmirch his name before his clients, thereby threatening his livelihood. As pointed out by the Respondent’s counsel, there was no objective evidence to show that this had happened[^49]. There was also no objective evidence to support the Applicant’s assertion of having prolonged stress-related physiological symptoms arising from this incident[^50].

66     In the premises, I held that the Applicant had not crossed the necessary threshold to obtain a PO.

## Decision

67     The requirements set out in s 12(2) POHA are conjunctive. As the Applicant had failed to cross the hurdle in s 12(2)(b), his application for a PO would fail. In any event, I took the view that it was not just and equitable for a PO to be issued in the context of this case.

68     In the premises, the OS was dismissed.

## Costs

69     Counsel for the Respondent submitted that costs should be fixed at $1,000 for the Respondent. Counsel for the Applicant submitted that there should be no order as to costs.

70     In my view, it was initially reasonable for the Applicant to have commenced action, given that there was harassment which appeared to be escalating in its scope. However, by 13 August 2018, it should have been clear to the Applicant that (i) the Respondent was prepared to take down all the offending communications, if told and (ii) the Respondent was unlikely to continue harassing him. In fact, the Respondent had eventually given up his employment claim as well[^51]. In the premises, there was really no necessity for the Applicant to have pushed on with this action. Hence, I would have been quite inclined to order costs to be paid by the Respondent up to the stage of the PTC, and for the subsequent costs to be borne by the Applicant. In this context, the Respondent’s costs submissions were eminently reasonable. I accordingly fixed costs at $1,000 for the Respondent.
