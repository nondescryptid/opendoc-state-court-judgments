Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Voluntarily causing hurt to police officer – Imprisonment

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9094/2021/01.\]

14 June 2021

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused. The Accused had pleaded guilty to three charges arising from an incident where he had voluntarily caused hurt towards two police officers and had used abusive words against one of them. He also admitted and consented to two charges of using criminal force on police officers to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing.

2       I sentenced the Accused as follows:

3       I ordered the sentences of imprisonment imposed on two charge to run concurrently giving a total sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment.

4       The Accused had applied for probation. Being dissatisfied with the sentence, he has filed a notice of appeal against sentence. The Accused has been released on bail pending the appeal. The sentence of fine has also been stayed pending the appeal.

5       I now set out the grounds of my decision.

## THE STATEMENT OF FACTS

6       The Accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution.

### Background Information

7       I set out briefly the facts contained therein.

> (i)     The accused persons are: Navinthiren Moses s/o Krishna (“the Accused”), a 23-year-old male Singapore citizen born on 23 January 1998; and

> (ii)     Yuvaraj Seva (“Yuvaraj”), a 21-year-old male Singapore citizen born on 1 February 2000.

8       The co-accused is M Dinesa (“Dinesa”), a 21-year-old male Singapore citizen born on 1 March 2000.

9       The first victim is Police Staff Sergeant Norimawati Binti Abdullah (“SSGT Norimawati”), a 30-year-old female. At the material time, SSGT Norimawati was a public servant attached to Nanyang Neighbourhood Police Centre.

10     The second victim is Police Staff Sergeant Muhammad Saiful Lizam Bin Mastor (“SSGT Saiful”), a 30-year-old male. At the material time, SSGT Saiful was a public servant attached to Nanyang Neighbourhood Police Centre.

11     The third victim is Police Sergeant (1) Muhammed Sharoalfian Bin Abdul Rahman (“SGT Sharoalfian”), a 23-year-old male. At the material time, SGT Sharoalfian was a public servant attached to Nanyang Neighbourhood Police Centre.

### First Information Report

12     On 24 January 2020, at or about 10.58pm, one Mohammed Dali Bin Ishak, a member of the public, called the police with text of message: “A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKE NOISE THERE. I CANNOT SLEEP”. The incident location given was the barbeque pit located in the vicinity of Blk 850, Jurong West Street 81, Singapore (“Incident Location”).

13     Besides this phone call, the Police received five other phone calls from annoyed members of the public.

### Facts Pertaining To The Charges

14     On 24 January 2020, a group of about 15 to 20 people, including the Accused, Yuvaraj and Dinesa, gathered at the Incident Location to celebrate the Accused’s birthday. The Accused and Yuvaraj had voluntarily consumed alcohol.

15     Later the same day, at or about 11.02pm, Police resources were despatched to the scene and the first officers to arrive at the Incident Location were SSGT Norimawati, Sergeant (2) Mohammed Syafil Mohammed Yusof (“SGT Syafil”) and Sergeant (2) Amalul Arifin Bin Rossli. Upon seeing the large group of suspects, who appeared drunk and rowdy, SSGT Norimawati requested for backup.

16     The said three police officers then walked towards the group of suspects and SGT Syafil asked them what was going on. Dinesa approached SGT Syafil and behaved aggressively. SGT Syafil questioned Dinesa on his aggressive behaviour to which Dinesa replied, “Why? I am just walking around what?”. Dinesa was then pulled away by other members of the group.

17     Subsequently, at or about 11.06pm, SSGT Saiful and SGT Sharoalfian arrived at the Incident Location to assist the said 3 police officers. SSGT Saiful then advised the group of suspects to lower their volume and asked them to furnish their particulars.

18     The Accused and Dinesa approached SSGT Saiful and SGT Syafil, and verbally challenged them about the law. SSGT Norimawati then joined SSGT Saiful and SGT Syafil and tried to calm the Accused down. The Accused refused to listen to SSGT Norimawati, slapped her left hand away and shouted “fuck you lah” to her in English. Upon hearing this, SSGT Saiful told the Accused to watch his language. The Accused then used both his hands to push SSGT Saiful on his shoulders.

19     SSGT Saiful then tried to calm the Accused down. However, the Accused refused to cooperate and, together with Dinesa, started shouting at SSGT Saiful. SGT Sharoalfian then joined SSGT Norimawati and SSGT Saiful to calm the Accused and Dinesa down.

20     At or about 11.15pm, suddenly, Yuvaraj, who was standing a distance away, ran aggressively towards SGT Sharoalfian and shouted “chee bye” at him in the Hokkien dialect, which means “cunt” in the English language. SSGT Saiful managed to prevent Yuvaraj from getting to SGT Sharoalfian and attempted to effect an arrest on Yuvaraj by pinning him down on the grass patch.

21     Yuvaraj put up a violent struggle during the arrest and punched SSGT Saiful once on his left cheek. A scuffle ensued. Three to four members from the group of suspects joined the scuffle and SSGT Saiful was hit on his head, back and shoulders. The Accused was one of the three to four members who joined the scuffle. Subsequently, the Accused punched SSGT Saiful on his back once.

22     SSGT Norimawati saw the Accused punching SSGT Saiful and she pulled the Accused away. Thereafter, the Accused punched SSGT Norimawati on her left cheek once. The Accused then walked away from SSGT Norimawati and she followed him. Subsequently, the Accused ran towards SSGT Saiful again. SSGT Norimawati then pulled the Accused away again and he punched SSGT Norimawati once on her right cheek.

23     Separately, SGT Sharoalfian intervened to assist SSGT Saiful. As SGT Sharoalfian was doing so, Dinesa pushed SGT Sharoalfian on his chest with both hands, causing SGT Sharoalfian to fall backwards onto the grass patch.

24     More Police officers subsequently arrived as backup, and the Accused, Yuvaraj and Dinesa, were placed under arrest. They were then escorted to Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters.

25     After their arrest, the Accused’s and Yuvaraj’s blood samples were taken and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

26     The Accused’s blood sample was found to contain 102mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood. Yuvaraj’s blood sample was found to contain 108mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood.

27     SSGT Norimawati sought medical treatment at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on 25 January 2020, at or about 1.34am. She was assessed and was diagnosed with a jaw contusion and was given three days of medical leave.

28     SSGT Saiful sought medical treatment at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on 25 January 2020, at or about 1.36am. He was assessed and was diagnosed with facial abrasions and upper back contusion. SSGT Saiful was given three days of medical leave.

29     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused did:

> (i)     use abusive words to SSGT Norimawati, a public servant in relation to the execution of her duty as such public servant, by uttering the words “fuck you lah” to her in English. The Accused has thereby committed an offence under s 6(1)(a) POHA punishable under s 6(3) POHA;

> (ii)     voluntarily cause hurt to SSGT Norimawati, a public servant in the execution of her duty as such public servant, by punching SSGT Norimawati once on her left cheek and once on her right cheek and thereby causing her bodily pain. The Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 332 of the Penal Code; and

> (iii)     voluntarily cause hurt to SSGT Saiful, a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, by punching SSGT Saiful on his back once and thereby causing him bodily pain. The Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 332 Penal Code.

30     Dinesa was sentenced on 21 October 2020 to 18 months’ probation for a charge under s 332 PC and a charge under s 6(1)(a) POHA punishable under s 6(3) POHA.

31     For completeness, I had sentenced Yuvaraj who was convicted together with the Accused, to 21 months’ probation.

## ANTECEDENTS

32     The Accused does not have any previous convictions.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

33     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 4 months and 1 week’s imprisonment based on the following breakdown:

> (i)     DAC 917545/20 : 3 months (concurrent);

> (ii)     DAC 917546/20 : at least 4 months (consecutive); and

> (iii)     MAC 906901/20: at least 1 week (consecutive)

34     The Prosecution relied on the observation of the High Court in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”) at \[59\] to submit that a custodial sentence of 2 to 9 months’ imprisonment would generally be imposed for cases involving causing hurt to police officers. The Prosecution submitted that this is not an exceptional case justifying such a departure in response to the Defence’s application for probation report to be called given that the Accused was already 22 years old at the time of the offence.

## MITIGATION

35     The Defence submitted that the Accused is a young offender and comes from a structured family. The Defence Counsel also submitted that the Accused was remorseful and had pleaded guilty. The Accused had also not committed any further offences for 1 year and 3 months since the incident to date.

36     The Defence also argued that the harm caused was low as the injuries sustained were superficial.

37     Finally, the Defence also asserted that the Accused knew that his cousin Yuvaraj was suffering from ‘absence epilepsy’ and was calling out “I cannot breathe” whilst being pinned down by the police and this could have triggered his response.

38     As for his future, the Defence highlighted that the Accused had a diploma for Aeronautical Engineering and has been shortlisted for a place in Singapore University of Social Studies. He therefore urged the Court to give him a chance and to call for a probation report. He also referred to two cases where probation has been given. I shall refer to the cases cited for comparison subsequently in this judgment.

## THE COURT’S DECISION ON SENTENCE

### The sentencing principles for offence of causing hurt to police officers

39     The Courts have consistently taken a stern view of any form of violence against law enforcement officers in the course of the discharge of their duties as such law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers such as the police must feel that they are adequately protected by the law whilst carrying out their important role of keeping law and order. As such, custodial sentences are the norm to ensure that public confidence is not undermined. The High Court in _Jeffrey Yeo_ has aptly pointed out that “incidents of attack, if left unchecked, could undermine public confidence in our police officers as authority figures in society and compromise their effectiveness as a symbol of law and order” (at \[49\]).

40     Accordingly, the principles of **_deterrence_** take precedence in such cases. The High Court _Jeffrey Yeo_ accepted that the sentencing norm for past cases has been 2-9 months of imprisonment. It then set out a sentencing framework for accused persons who plead guilty and do not have any relevant antecedents, as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.46%"> <col width="46.6%"> <col width="34.94%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Category</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Circumstances</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing Band</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or up to one year’s imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to three years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to seven years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

### Application of the sentencing framework

41     Given that the harm caused here, in terms of injuries sustained consisting of contusions and abrasions, is rather minor and that the Accused had used only his hand to punch, I found that the two charges under section 332 of the Penal Code would fall under category 1 with the sentencing range of fine to one year’s imprisonment.

42     Fines are clearly inappropriate as they should only be imposed in very exceptional circumstances. The example given in _Jeffrey Yeo_ is one of a very young offender giving a shove on a police officer which occurred away from the public view. In the present case, the Accused had done more than just shoving a police officer.

43     I will now highlight the aggravating features I had found in the case. Of the 2 charges, the more serious would be the one involving 2 punches to the cheek of SSGT Norimawati. It was aggravating that the punches were delivered on 2 separate occasions and they were delivered because SSGT Norimawati was attempting to stop him from hurting another police officer.

44     The punches were also delivered to the face, a vulnerable part of the body. Hard blows to the face have the potential to cause significant pain as well as even facial bone fractures. The Accused also had no qualms about punching a female officer.

45     It is also aggravating that the Accused was under self-induced intoxication. His blood alcohol reading was 102mg per 100 ml of blood. For comparison to understand the significance of this amount, it is almost 3 times the legal amount for drink driving. This would explain the Accused’s aggressive and defiant behaviour throughout the incident. He started with confronting the police officers verbally challenging them about the law. He then turned physically aggressive when he slapped SSGT Norimawati’s hand away and shouted, “fuck you lah”. He then joined Denisa in shouting at SSGT Saiful. He finally resorted to actual physical violence in attacking SSGT Saiful and SSGT Norimawati. His intoxicated clearly had induced a much more aggressive and violent behaviour in him. Such alcohol-fuel behaviour should be taken into account as an aggravating consideration as held in the case of _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span> at \[44\]. In any case, it is clearly not mitigating to say that the Accused’s was out of character and he would not have behaved in that manner had he not been so intoxicated.

46     I also took into account that the loutish and drunken behaviour had taken place in a HDB residential area at a barbeque pit and had disturbed the public peace with no fewer than 6 phone calls received by the police from annoyed members of the public. The gathering was also of a fairly large group of 15-20 people. The Accused and a few of his intoxicated friends in attacking the law enforcement officers in such public view and in front of this crowd of people had clearly shown blatant disregard and open defiance. Such behaviour must be strongly deterred lest it encourages such emboldened and brazen behaviour towards police officers.

47     Finally, I took into account two charges of using criminal force on police officers which had been consented by the Accused to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

48     Without considering the mitigating factors, I would therefore consider that the appropriate sentence would lie somewhere around the middle of the first sentencing band in _Jeffrey Yeo._ For the more aggravated offence against SSGT Norimawati, I would have imposed a sentence of 20 weeks’ imprisonment and a sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment in respect of the offence against SSGT Saiful.

### Is probation an appropriate option?

49     I now turn to the mitigating factors. I accept that the Accused had shown remorse by pleading guilty. I also note that he is relatively young, in that he was 22 years old at the time of the offences and that this was the first time he had fallen foul of the law.

50     The Defence submitted that probation had been granted in 2 cases reported in the news which appeared to be more aggravated. The first was that of a 17-year-old who had caused spinal cord injury and superficial bite marks on a police officer in the course of resisting arrest. He was given 2 years’ probation. The second case involved a 21-year old National Service Police officer who whilst off-duty had gone drinking with his friends. When they were checked by police, the offender had gotten into a scuffle with a police officer and whilst on the ground, had tried to choke the victim for about 5 seconds. The offender was given 18 months’ probation.

51     I find that little precedential value can be placed on such news reports. Even if the facts had been reported accurately, one does not know of what other material facts had been taken into account in the final sentence imposed.

52     It is also clear from the reported facts that for the first case, the offender was much younger, being 17 years old at the time of sentencing. Similarly, for the second case, the offender was 21 years old at the time of sentencing.

53     In the present case, the Accused was 22 years old at the time of the offending and 23 years old at the time of sentencing. He is to be treated as an adult. He was not suffering from any mental disorder or incapacity that would warrant a more rehabilitative approach to be taken.

54     I also found that the parity of sentencing principle does not apply in relation to the orders of probation meted out to Yuvaraj and Dinesa given that they were 20 years old at the time of the offending and hence different sentencing considerations were applied to their cases.

55     In the case of _PP v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 1412</span> (“_Terence Siow_”), the offender was similarly 23 years old at the time of sentencing and 22 years old at the time of the offence. He pleaded guilty to one charge of outraging the victim’s modesty by touching her buttocks over her shorts while on the public transport network with two other charges of touching the victim’s thigh taken into consideration. In the first instance, he was sentenced to 21 months’ probation.

56     The High Court held that deterrence was the operative sentencing consideration for that offence and rehabilitation would not be the predominant consideration for an adult offender unless there existed exceptional circumstances or the offender could demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform.

57     In assessing whether there was “an extremely strong propensity for reform”, the High Court applied a 3-limbed framework:

> (i)     Whether the offender had demonstrated a positive desire to change since the commission of the offences;

> (ii)     There were conditions in the offender’s life that were conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf; and

> (iii)     If after considering the first two limbs, the Court comes to a provisional view that the offender had demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, then to consider whether in the light of the risk factors presented, there were reasons to revisit the finding of such a high capacity for reform.

58     Applying this framework, I found that while the Accused had managed to steer clear of any other offence since the commission of the offences, he had not demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform.

59     Whilst he had taken steps to go for tertiary education and his family background did not see to pose any risk factors, there is nothing exceptionally strong about his propensity for reform such as to tilt the balance in his favour for rehabilitation to take centre stage.

60     In fact, he tried to downplay his reaction by alluding to the fact that he may have acted out of a sense of concern for his cousin Yuvaraj who was suffering from “absence epilepsy” when he was being pinned down. The Prosecution successfully rebutted this point by highlighting that the Accused had punched SSGT Norimawati when she was not involved in pinning Yuvaraj. I also noted that the Accused was already behaving in a belligerent manner even before Yuvaraj was being pinned down. He had already committed the criminal force offences of slapping SSGT Norimawati’s hand and shoving SSGT Saiful on his shoulders by that stage. This threw doubt on the genuineness of his remorse.

61     In addition, the Accused had not shown that he had taken any active steps to leave his errant ways behind. There is no mention of him attending any counselling with regard to his drinking.

62     Accordingly, I did not find it necessary to call for a probation report to assess the Accused’s suitability for probation. Nonetheless, I do accept that based on the mitigating factors highlighted and particularly his young age, there should be some downward adjustment to the initial sentences I have indicated at \[49\] above. I had accordingly calibrated the sentences downwards to 15 weeks and 10 weeks respectively.

63     As the two custodial sentences imposed were in respect of offences which were committed in one incident, I agree with Prosecution for both sentences to run concurrently giving a total sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment.

64     As for the offence of using abusive words, given that it was not prolonged abuse and this is the first offence for the Accused, a non-custodial sentence is sufficient and I sentenced the Accused to a fine of $2,000 for this offence with a default sentence of 1 week’s imprisonment.

## CONCLUSION

65     Whilst _Terrence Siow_ does provide an option for probation for an adult offender, it is clearly only under exceptional circumstances or there exists an extremely strong propensity for reform, that in balancing the need for rehabilitation and deterrence, rehabilitation is found to be the dominant consideration.

66     In the present case, I did not find it to be so. Deterrence remains the dominant sentencing principle and hence custodial sentences have been meted out.
