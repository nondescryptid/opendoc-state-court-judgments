Contract – Contractual terms

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 35/2022 and HC/DCA 36/2022.\]

18 November 2022

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for the return of a loan of US$100,000 together with contractual interest of 10% per annum. At the time of the trial, the loan of US$100,000 was not disputed, but the contractual interest was disputed.

2       The defendant has a counterclaim for the sum of US$41,750 allegedly misappropriated by the plaintiff, comprising US$31,705 transferred to Navitas Resources (UK) Ltd and US$10,000 transferred to NR Capital Pte Ltd.

3       I allowed the plaintiff’s claim for the loan of US$100,000, but not the claim for contractual interest. As for the defendant’s counterclaim, I allowed the claim for US$10,000, but not the claim for US$31,705.

4       Both the plaintiff and the defendant have appealed against my decision.

## Facts

5       The plaintiff and the defendant are British nationals.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) The plaintiff resides in the United Kingdom. The defendant resides in Singapore.

6       The defendant incorporated a Singapore company, Navitas Resources Pte Ltd (“Navitas Singapore”), in 2009, to provide management consultancy services and training in capital and commodities markets.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

7       The defendant subsequently incorporated another company in the United Kingdom in 2014, called Navitas Resources (UK) Ltd (“NRUK”). Thereafter, Navitas Singapore became a wholly owned subsidiary of NRUK. NRUK was also in the business of providing management consultancy services.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

8       The defendant developed a strategy to trade in the price movements of international commodity markets and had coded this strategy (“the Algorithm”).[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) The plaintiff and the defendant agreed to incorporate a company called Navitas Resources Capital Ltd (“NRCUK”) and invest money in NRCUK to prove the Algorithm.[^5]

9       The plaintiff and the defendant also incorporated a Singapore company called NR Capital Pte Ltd (“NRCSGP”), together with a friend of the plaintiff, John Charles Collis (“Collis”) and two other individuals.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

10     In March 2016, the defendant, Collis and the plaintiff agreed to invest the sums of US$100,000, US$50,000 and US$100,000 respectively in NRCUK.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

11     The plaintiff lent the defendant the sum of US$100,000, to enable the defendant to contribute to NRCUK’s capital. This was separate from the plaintiff’s own investment in NRCUK.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

12     The plaintiff’s claim is for the sum of US$100,000 together with interest of 10% per annum under a loan agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

13     The defendant does not dispute the loan of US$100,000, but denies that there was any agreement for interest.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

14     The plaintiff further claims that the loan with interest was repayable by 30 April 2018,[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) whereas the defendant claims that the loan was repayable by 30 April 2021.[^12] As the trial of this matter was heard in 2022, this issue is no longer material.

### Plaintiff’s interest claim

15     The plaintiff has produced a draft loan agreement. Under this draft loan agreement, there is a clause providing for interest of 10% per annum.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

16     The plaintiff claims that an agreement in line with this draft, was signed by the defendant and the signed copy was kept by Collis, who is a lawyer.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) The plaintiff claims that the defendant and the plaintiff met and signed the loan agreement at a meeting in the Oxford and Cambridge Club in the presence of Collis on 11 April 2016.[^15]

17     The plaintiff claims that he sent the draft loan agreement to the defendant “at his request at about 11:55 on 11 April 2016 after we met and executed the Loan Agreement.”[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

### Defendant’s position on plaintiff’s interest claim

18     The defendant does not dispute that there was a meeting at the Oxford and Cambridge Club, but denies signing the loan agreement produced by the plaintiff, with the clause providing for interest of 10% per annum.

19     The defendant’s position is that:

> (a)     The plaintiff sent him by email a draft of the loan agreement at the meeting on 11 April 2016, but the defendant rejected this, because it included compound interest and a very short repayment term.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> (b)     The plaintiff and the defendant subsequently agreed that the loan would be for a period of five years without any interest, in view of the profits that would be earned from the Algorithm. An agreement was signed on 13 or 15 April 2016 documenting this, which was kept by the plaintiff. A copy was not extended to the defendant.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

20     The account of Collis, who gave evidence on behalf of the defendant, was that he had given the plaintiff a draft of an old loan agreement that he had used in the past as a sample, with the parties’ names and the amount of the loan filled in.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) His position is that “We discussed a lot of matters” at the meeting on 11 April 2016, but when the plaintiff raised the loan with the defendant, he told them “that was their own business” and “promptly withdrew”.[^20]

21     Collis acknowledges witnessing the plaintiff and the defendant signing the loan agreement, but is unable to recall the date. His evidence is that “I cannot say what the content of their loan documents was as I deliberately confined myself to witnessing their signatures.”[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

22     Prior to the commencement of legal proceedings, the plaintiff’s solicitors in a letter dated 3 September 2019 to Collis, demanded that the signed loan agreement be returned to the plaintiff.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) Collis replied, denying that he was given the signed loan agreement.[^23]

## Issue relating to the plaintiff’s interest claim

23     The key issue relating to the plaintiff’s interest claim is whether the parties agreed to the interest of 10% per annum, as set out in the draft loan agreement that the plaintiff sent to the defendant.

24     The plaintiff’s position is that the draft loan agreement which he sent to the defendant on 11 April 2016, is in line with the document that was signed by the parties earlier that day which contains the clause for 10% interest per annum.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) The defendant’s position is that he rejected that draft which contained the clause for 10% interest per annum and that the loan agreement which he subsequently signed did not contain such a clause.[^25]

25     Neither party produced the signed loaned agreement. The plaintiff alleged that it was kept by Collis.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) The defendant alleged that it was kept by the plaintiff.[^27]

## Decision on the plaintiff’s interest claim

26     In _Chan Tam Hoi (alias Paul Chan) v Wang Jian and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 192</span> (“_Chan Tam Hoi_”), the General Division of the High Court (at \[67\]) set out “the first three guiding principles from the oft-cited framework in the High Court decision of _ARS v ART_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 78</span> (“_ARS v ART_”), where Quentin Loh J held as follows (at \[53\]):

> (a)     in ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement, the court will consider the relevant documentary evidence (such as written correspondence) and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time;

> (b)     where possible, the court should look first at the relevant documentary evidence; and

> (c)     the availability of relevant documentary evidence reduces the need to rely solely on the credibility of witnesses in order to ascertain if an oral agreement exists.”

27     The court in _Chan Tam Hoi_ (at \[71\]), further referred to the decision of Chan Seng Onn J in _Naughty G Pte Ltd v Fortune Marketing Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1208</span> (at \[57\]), where it was “held that the general guidelines set out in _ARS v ART_ in ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement are equally applicable to ascertaining the terms of such an agreement. Both involve a holistic view of the evidence to determine what (if anything) was agreed between the parties.”

28     I am of the view that the aforesaid guidelines in _ARS v ART_ are similarly applicable in the present case, where the signed loan agreement has not been produced. It is necessary for the court to ascertain from the relevant documentary evidence and the contemporaneous conduct of the parties, whether there is an agreement for 10% interest per annum as alleged by the plaintiff.

### Claim unsupported by documentary evidence and contemporaneous conduct

29     I am unable to accept the plaintiff’s claim for contractual interest of 10% per annum, in the light of the following documentary evidence and contemporaneous conduct of the plaintiff:

> (a)     The letter dated 3 September 2019 from the plaintiff’s solicitors to Collis demanding that the signed loan agreement be returned to the plaintiff, refers to “the recovery of a loan of US$100,000 made to \[the defendant\]”, but makes no mention of the purported interest of 10% per annum.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) This letter was sent before the plaintiff commenced the action herein on 21 October 2019.

> (b)     In a subsequent letter to Collis dated 4 October 2019,[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) the plaintiff’s solicitors refer to the loan agreement being “tailored by \[Collis\] to the subject matter of the transaction”, but makes no mention of the purported 10% per annum interest.

> (c)     Furthermore, the plaintiff never made any demand or notice for payment of the 10% interest on any of the dates that the interest purportedly accrued on 30 April 2017, 30 April 2018 and 30 April 2019.

30     If there was an agreement for 10% interest, one would expect it to be referred to in either one of the aforesaid letters or when the interest accrued. Instead, neither letter makes any mention of interest, nor was there any demand made when the interest accrued.

31     Furthermore, the plaintiff’s contention that the signed loan agreement was kept by Collis is unbelievable, in view of an email dated 11 March 2016 from Collis to the plaintiff and the defendant, stating that he was not acting as their solicitor. The relevant extract from that email is as follows:

> In light of our proposed venture as co-directors and co-shareholders, I shall not act as solicitor to either of you, or any company. … If you are happy to acknowledge that I am not advising either of you as a solicitor, nor as your solicitor, I am happy to draft documentation for consideration. For the sake of clarity and good order, I note that neither of you, nor the companies would be invoiced for my services as a solicitor, nor would you or I have the benefit of my firm’s professional indemnity insurance.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

32     In view of the aforesaid email, there is no reason for the plaintiff to have Collis keep the signed loan agreement, since Collis was not acting as the plaintiff’s solicitor in this transaction.

33     The plaintiff alleged that he sent the unsigned loan agreement to the defendant “at his request at about 11:55 on 11 April 2016 after we met and executed the Loan Agreement”.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) I find this allegation unbelievable, for the following reasons:

> (a)     If the loan agreement was already signed, it makes little sense for an unsigned copy to be sent, rather than the signed copy.

> (b)     The subject of the email attaching the unsigned loan agreement was “Fwd: draft for review”. One would have expected the plaintiff to indicate in the subject or the body of the email that the loan agreement was signed, if that was indeed the case. Neither was done.

34     The plaintiff also changed his position on the time of his aforesaid email. In his Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, the plaintiff pleaded that “At about 11:55 pm on 11 April 2016, at the request of the Defendant, the Plaintiff sent by email, a copy of the Agreement prepared by Collis to the Defendant which was signed earlier that day.”[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) In cross-examination, the plaintiff conceded “that was a mistake, … it was at 11:55am.”[^33]

35     The plaintiff’s position in his pleading on the timing of his email, was meant to buttress his allegation that the loan agreement that he sent to the defendant by that email, was a copy of that which the parties signed earlier that day. The plaintiff’s change in position on the timing, further diminishes the credibility of his evidence on this allegation.

36     The plaintiff has submitted that the defendant did not amend the draft that was sent to him.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) However, the defendant’s evidence is that he had rejected the draft.[^35] When the defendant was cross-examined on the defendant not responding to the email attaching the draft, the defendant explained that the email was sent to his mobile phone while he was sitting with the plaintiff.[^36] In further cross-examining the defendant, counsel for the plaintiff suggested that it was logical that the loan agreement must have been signed on 11 April 2016, before the money was transferred to the defendant on 12 April 2016.[^37] However, the defendant’s response was that this was not the plaintiff’s previous practice.[^38]

37     I find the defendant’s aforesaid explanation in cross-examination more credible than the plaintiff’s position, in view of:

> (a)     the plaintiff’s email to the defendant referring to the document as a draft rather than as a signed agreement,

> (b)     the plaintiff’s failure to raise the alleged 10% per annum interest when the interest purportedly accrued, and

> (c)     the plaintiff’s failure to raise this interest in his solicitor’s letters of 3 September and 4 October 2019 to Collis.

38     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I am unable to accept the plaintiff’s claim for 10% interest per annum.

## Counterclaim for alleged misappropriation of US$41,750

39     In relation to the defendant’s counterclaim, the defendant has pleaded the following:

> (a)     In September 2017, the plaintiff, the defendant and Collis decided to cease their investment venture in NRCUK and recover whatever investments they could on a pro-rated basis. It was agreed that the amount of US$170,000 would be divided between the three parties as follows:

>> (i)       The plaintiff US$85,500

>> (ii)       The defendant US$41,750

>> (iii)       Collis US$42,750.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

> (b)     The defendant has a counterclaim against the plaintiff for the aforesaid sum of US$41,750, which he claims was misappropriated by the plaintiff, of which:

>> (i)       US$31,705 was paid to NRUK, and

>> (ii)       US$10,000 was paid to NRCSGP.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

40     The defendant’s evidence is that the aforesaid payments to NRUK and NRCSGP, were made by the plaintiff from NRCUK’s bank account, without the defendant’s knowledge or authorisation.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41)

### Defendant agreed that US$31,705 be paid to NRUK

41     In an email from the defendant to the plaintiff dated 4 October 2017, the defendant states “I noted nrcuk account usd31,705 went to nruk as agreed.”[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42)

42     From the aforesaid email, it is clear that the defendant had agreed that US$31,705 would be paid to NRUK. Furthermore, the defendant in cross-examination, accepted that had had agreed to this.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43)

43     The defendant claimed that this agreement was in a conversation a week after the transfer had been made,[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) and that he had not agreed before the transfer took place.[^45] Nevertheless, even if this agreement was only after the transfer of the US$31,705 had been made, it is clear that the defendant had no issue with the transfer to NRUK, contrary to his pleaded allegation that the sum of US$31,705 had been misappropriated.

44     In cross-examination, the defendant claimed that “\[the plaintiff\] wanted to take back $41,000 which he lends to me and I was happy to give it back to him and offset, but I need the $10,000 myself. So he was going to take back 31,000”.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) However, this allegation that the defendant agreed to the transfer of the sum of US$31,705 to NRUK to offset and reduce the outstanding loan that was made to him, was not pleaded by the defendant.[^47]

45     Although the defendant has pleaded that he is “entitled to a set-off of the sum of US$41,750 being money payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendant for money had and received”,[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48) this is different from the defendant’s aforesaid allegation that he “was happy to give it back to \[the plaintiff\] and offset” the loan. The defendant’s pleading is on the basis that the sum allegedly misappropriated by the plaintiff, should be set off against the loan, whereas the defendant’s allegation in cross-examination is that the defendant intended to give back the sum to the plaintiff to reduce the outstanding loan.

46     Furthermore, the defendant’s allegation in cross-examination that he “was happy to give it back to \[the plaintiff\] and offset”, is inconsistent with his pleading that “the sum of US$41,750 was … misappropriated by the Plaintiff”.

47     In the light of the aforesaid inconsistent positions taken by the defendant, the defendant’s claim for the sum of US$31,705 is not credible at all. Accordingly, there is no basis for the defendant’s counterclaim for the aforesaid sum of U$31,705.

### US$10,000 paid to NRCSGP was to have been paid to the defendant

48     As for the US$10,000 paid to NRCSGP, the aforesaid email from the defendant to the plaintiff dated 4 October 2017 states “… usd10k was sent to nr capital referencing my name. I thought we had agreed usd10k would come back to me personally? Now that it went via nrc sgp I have to pay tax on it despite it being borrowed debt?”[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

49     It is further stated in the email that NRCSGP used the US$10,000 to pay for rental and other invoices, rather than paying the defendant. Although the email refers to the defendant drawing US$6,700,[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) it is also stated in that email that it “is equivalent to \[his\] usual gbp5k draw.”

50     In view of the aforesaid email from the defendant stating that “I thought we had agreed usd10k would come back to me personally?”, I accept that US$10,000 should have been paid by the plaintiff to the defendant instead of NRCSGP.

51     Although the plaintiff’s reply of 5 October 2017 states that the payment to NRCSGP was payment to the defendant’s director’s account,[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) the payments made from the US$10,000 by NRCSGP for rental, other invoices, and the defendant’s drawing, were for NRCSGP’s liabilities. The US$10,000 was not paid to the defendant personally from NRCUK, as agreed. The plaintiff’s contention that the defendant had full control over that NRCSGP account,[^52] misses the point, as any payment made by NRCSGP to the defendant from that account had to be for sums due from NRCSGP to the defendant.

52     The plaintiff also claimed in cross-examination that he did not have the defendant’s personal account details, so he made payment to NRCSGP.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) However, this allegation that the plaintiff did not have the defendant’s personal account details, is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s payment to the defendant’s personal account when he disbursed the loan to the defendant.[^54] The plaintiff has not given any explanation for this inconsistency.

53     The plaintiff has submitted that the sum of US$10,000 was not personally retained by the plaintiff and that in the circumstances, the defendant should not be making his counterclaim against the plaintiff.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55) I am unable to accept this argument, as it was the plaintiff who transferred this sum to NRCSGP, even though the plaintiff did not personally retain this sum.

54     In the premises, I accepted the defendant’s counterclaim for the sum of US$10,000.

## Conclusion

55     In conclusion, judgment was entered for the plaintiff’s claim in the sum of US$90,000, being the plaintiff’s claim for the loan of US$100,000, less the counterclaim allowed in the sum of US$10,000.

56     With respect to interest, as statutory interest was not pleaded, I only awarded interest conceded by the defendant at 5.33% per annum after 30 April 2021.

57     Costs were awarded in favour of the plaintiff.
