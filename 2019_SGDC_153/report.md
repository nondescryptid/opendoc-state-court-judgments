### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       This is a case where a promising head chef’s taste buds were compromised following a botched wisdom tooth extraction. What ought to have been a relatively uncomplicated procedure unfolded into a series of unfortunate events that upended the chef’s career as he knew it.

2       The case raises issues on the quality of evidence required to sustain a claim for loss of future earnings (“LFE”) as well as the relevant test to be applied to a claim for loss of earning capacity (“LEC”) where the plaintiff changes his occupation following the accident.

## Background facts

#### The parties

3       The plaintiff, Mr Pawel Gajewski (“the Plaintiff”), is a 32-year-old Australian citizen. He had worked as a professional chef since he was 19 years old in various Michelin-starred restaurants in the world such as Noma in Copenhagen, Guy Savoy in Paris and Le Atelier in Paris. At the material time of the accident in 2013, the Plaintiff was the head chef of the Tippling Club, a fine dining restaurant in Singapore, and was earning a monthly income of S$4,350.[^1]

4       The defendant, Dr Lee Tong Lynn (“the Defendant”), was at the material time a registered dentist at Fusion Dental, Nexus @ One North.

#### The accident and injury

5       On 23 April 2013, the Plaintiff underwent a wisdom tooth surgical extraction that was performed by the Defendant. The procedure turned out to be complicated as the Plaintiff’s tooth could not be extracted. The Defendant nonetheless persisted in trying to extract the tooth for about three hours. The Plaintiff was subsequently diagnosed to have sustained in the course of the procedure a serious injury to the right lingual nerve, resulting in severe impairment consistent with a Sunderland IV to V degree injury (“the Injury”).

6       The Injury resulted in the Plaintiff being unable to taste or discern texture or temperature in the right side of his tongue with the chances of recovery being either non-existent or at best poor.

#### Post-accident employment

7       In January 2014, the Plaintiff’s monthly salary as head chef with the Tippling Club increased from S$4,350 to S$6,200.[^2]

8       The Plaintiff then resigned from the Tippling Club in December 2015 and returned to Melbourne wherein he worked for about a year with Tipo 00 Pasta Bar from February 2016 to November 2016.

9       The Plaintiff then joined Tommy Collins by Atlantic Group, a catering company, and worked there from early 2017 to February 2018.

10     On February 2018, the Plaintiff opened a consultancy business in Australia under the name of Ruminate Concepts Pty Ltd (“Ruminate”) and is presently engaged with the same. Ruminate provides freelance consultancy services to clients intending to open restaurants.

## Procedural history

11     The Defendant did not contest the issue of liability and consent interlocutory judgment was accordingly recorded on 24 October 2016 with damages to be assessed. The assessment of damages hearing (“the AD Hearing”) was heard over two tranches on 23 January 2019 and 31 May 2019. Written submissions for the matter were tendered on 21 June 2019.

## Summary of parties’ position

12     The parties have agreed to a sum of S$30,000 for pain and suffering of the Injury and disability and S$2,066.00 for medical and transportation expenses, leaving only the issue of LFE and LEC for assessment.

13     The Plaintiff claims the sum of A$144,000 for LFE and the sum of S$75,000 for LEC.

14     The Defendant, on the other hand, submits that no award should be made for both LFE and LEC.

15     I address the claims in turn, starting first with the claim for LFE.

## Loss of future earnings (LFE)

#### Parties’ submissions

16     The Plaintiff argues that he had only left the Tippling Club “in order to avoid termination as he was blamed for the drop in the restaurant’s rankings due to his poor performance caused by his permanent disability”.[^3] The Plaintiff further submits that if not for the disability, it is likely that he could have continued working at the Tippling Club or moved on to work in other fine dining restaurants in the world.

17     To justify his claim for LFE, the Plaintiff highlights that his current business with Ruminate does not provide income security and also pays him considerably less salary than what he was earning in the Tippling Club. In connection with this, the Plaintiff tendered for the first time, by way of examination-in-chief during the first tranche of the AD Hearing, several receipts and invoices in respect of the jobs held by the Plaintiff after leaving the Tippling Club.[^4]

18     Overall, the Plaintiff submits a figure of A$750 for the multiplicand and 18 years for the multiplier, resulting in a total sum of A$144,000 for LFE.

19     The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff has failed to prove a real assessable loss of income because he has not shown what the earnings are of a head chef in Melbourne or Australia, and neither is there evidence of what a consultant earns per month or year. There is also no credible evidence on his earnings such as tax records in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to show a proper account of what the Plaintiff claimed he earned in those years.[^5]

#### Applicable legal principles

20     The law on the principles governing assessment of LFE is neatly summarised in the _Practitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) (“_Practitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages”)_ as follows (at pp 29–30):

> Loss of future earnings seeks to compensate the plaintiff for **_any reduction in his earnings_** as a result of the disability suffered.

> …

> The basic method of assessing loss of future earnings is encapsulated in the following formula: **Multiplicand x Multiplier**. The multiplicand is derived by **_taking the difference between the plaintiff’s annual pre-accident income and his annual post-accident income_** (if any), less any other necessary deductions, for example, income tax. The multiplier is assessed by estimating the number of years the plaintiff is probably likely to suffer this reduction in earnings as a result of the accident.

> By multiplying the multiplier with the multiplicand, which is essentially the plaintiff’s loss of income per year, the total sum for the loss of future earnings is derived. This whole sum is intended to represent the total loss of the plaintiff’s future earnings as a result of his accident.

> \[emphasis in original in bold; emphasis added in bold italics\]

21     I must emphasise here that the multiplicand is assessed as “the difference between the post-accident and pre-accident income or rate of income” (_Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> (“_Linda Shaw_”) at \[20\]). In a related vein, the Court of Appeal in _Teo Sing Keng and another v Sim Ban Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 340</span> held as follows (at \[38\], citing the dictum in _Ong Ah Long v Dr S Underwood_ <span class="citation">\[1983\] 2 MLJ 324</span> at 333):

> Now, the general principle is that an injured plaintiff is entitled to damages for the loss of earnings and profits which he has suffered by reason of his injuries up to the date of the trial and for the loss of the prospective earnings and profits of which he is likely to be deprived in the future. _There must be evidence on which the court can find that the plaintiff will suffer future loss of earnings, it cannot act on mere speculation. If there is no satisfactory evidence of future loss of earnings_ but the court is satisfied that the plaintiff has suffered a loss of earning capacity, it will award him damages for his loss of capacity as part of the general damages for disability and not as compensation for future loss of earnings. …. \[emphasis added\]

22     In a similar vein, the Court of Appeal held in _Linda Shaw_ that (at \[19\]; see also _Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 420</span> at \[15\]):

> …\[A\] plaintiff has the burden of proving his or her claim in damages… \[L\]oss of future earnings must be _‘real assessable loss proved by evidence’_… Therefore, if a plaintiff should fail to provide _sufficient evidence_ of loss of future earnings, his or her claim for loss of future earnings cannot succeed. \[emphasis added\]

23     At this point, it is helpful to refer to some of the cases to illustrate how this principle actually works in practice.

24     In _Linda Shaw_, the Court of Appeal was able to adequately assess the LFE because there was concrete evidence on the hourly rate earned by the plaintiff both before and after the accident. There was also evidence that the plaintiff was no longer able to work the same number of hours (at \[4\], \[6\] and \[27\]–\[28\]). In the words of the Court of Appeal in _Linda Shaw_ (at \[30\]):

> … The quantum awarded for loss of future earnings was calculated based on the _actual_ number of hours the Respondent had worked before the accident and the _actual_ rate that the Respondent was earning after the accident. In other words, the quantum awarded was calculated based on figures that were not plucked out of thin air. Cumulatively, the evidence was concrete enough for the AR and the Judge to utilise. \[emphasis in original\]

25     I turn now to the High Court decision in _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> (“_Tan Hun Boon_”). In this case, the plaintiff was hit by a bus and suffered multiple fractures on his left leg and left hip and he had to undergo above-knee amputation, resulting in severe phantom limb pain. At the time of the accident in June 2011, the plaintiff was working as a senior consultant, earning a gross monthly salary of S$7,000. Following the accident, he went on medical leave for six months and no pay leave for three months. In April 2012, he returned to work but only on part-time basis. Under this arrangement, he was working two days a week at a salary of S$2,920 a month. He eventually found that he could not cope with the workload and resigned thereafter. In 2013, he worked as a senior research associate at the Singapore Management University, working 2.5 days a week at a salary of S$4,000 a month. Following that, he undertook some freelance work and attended a five-month coaching course. In 2014, he started his own business in the name of Coachcraft Pte Ltd (“Coachcraft”) to provide freelance career coaching services.

26     Even though there was some evidence of the plaintiff’s income after the accident, Pang Khang Chau JC found that he was unable to assess the LFE in this case. He explained that the plaintiff’s post-accident income fluctuated greatly (_Tan Hun Boon_ at \[132\]) and that there was no evidence of Coachcraft’s expenses to determine Coachcraft’s average monthly profit (at \[133\]). More fundamentally, he reasoned that the case was not a suitable one where LFE should be awarded on account of various uncertainties in the assessment. One of the uncertainties highlighted was that (at \[136\]):

> …\[T\]he Plaintiff was a salaried employee before the accident but is now self-employed. Being self-employed gives the Plaintiff a certain level of flexibility not available to a salaried employee and carries the potential for earnings to be scaled up in ways not possible with salaried employees. This makes a reasonable comparison between the Plaintiff’s pre-accident and post-accident earnings for the long term more difficult than in a case where the plaintiff was self-employed both before and after the accident or where the plaintiff was a salaried employee both before and after the accident. …

27     A further source of uncertainty also arose from the fact that Coachcraft had been in existence for only 1.75 years at the time of trial. Despite that, the company’s average monthly revenue in 2016 had risen by 52% above its average monthly revenue in 2015 and it was not certain whether the revenue would remain stagnant or grow (see _Tan Hun Boon_ at \[136\]).

28     In light of these uncertainties, the High Court was not prepared to find that the figures on Coachcraft’s earnings provided a fair estimate of what the plaintiff’s LFE was likely to be (see _Tan Hun Boon_ at \[136\]). Instead, the High Court found that an award of LEC was more appropriate to account for the disadvantages faced by the Plaintiff as a result of his fatigue and difficulties concentrating at work (at \[138).

#### Application to the facts

29     Parallels can be drawn in the present case with the situation in _Tan Hun Boon_. The Plaintiff, not unlike the plaintiff in _Tan Hun Boon_, was a salaried employee pre-accident and is now self-employed as a consultant with Ruminate (see \[10\] above). The status of his earnings are also uncertain given that Ruminate is a new company with just over a year of existence and there is also no evidence of the profits made by Ruminate.

30     While the Plaintiff has adduced several receipts and invoices in respect of the jobs held by the Plaintiff after leaving the Tippling Club,[^6] his income levels post-accident fluctuated greatly. This is a fact that the Plaintiff candidly concedes.[^7]

31     Further, even though Ruminate has been operational for about a year as at the date of the AD Hearing, there is no evidence of any financial accounting statements of Ruminate. Neither is there any statements or records of the revenue generated and/or expenses incurred by Ruminate in the past year. All that has been tendered in evidence are two invoices for payments made to Ruminate. First, there is an invoice dated 20 May 2018 for payment of A$18,025 in connection with the Plaintiff’s efforts to open a restaurant in Boat Quay, Singapore.[^8] Second, there is an invoice dated 20 December 2018 for a sum of A$3,000 in relation to the Plaintiff’s work over four days with Ruminate.[^9] Besides these, I do not have before me the complete financial history of Ruminate. Given the incomplete and unsatisfactory state of the evidence, I am unable to accurately determine the profits made by Ruminate and consequently the post-accident earnings of the Plaintiff.

32     More fundamentally, a serious deficiency in the Plaintiff’s claim for LFE is the absence of objective evidence such as income tax statements to establish the Plaintiff’s post-accident income and consequently the basis of calculation for the multiplicand. The Plaintiff testified that he now pays less taxes than before the accident and that he has income tax documents to the effect.[^10] However, this was an uncorroborated assertion. Income tax statements or other official documents to show proof of the Plaintiff’s income post-accident could easily have been adduced in evidence. However, for unexplained reasons best known to himself, the Plaintiff had elected not to do so. In the circumstances, I do not have sufficient evidence before me to properly assess the future loss of earnings that the Plaintiff would suffer in this case.

33     Perhaps, cognisant of these evidential difficulties, the Plaintiff submits as follows:[^11]

> On average, from February 2018 to December 2018, the Plaintiff now earns a range of between A$1,012.60 (approximately S$982.10) per month post-injury – this translates to a loss of about S$5,217.90 in comparison to his pre-injury monthly income of S$6,200. _For the purposes of this action, the Plaintiff is prepared to adopt a multiplicand of A$750 (S$727.40) for his claim for loss of future earnings_. In other words, the multiplicand is very modest/conservative, and does not require the Court to make too many assumptions regarding the Plaintiff’s career trajectory, if not for the injury. \[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added\]

34     In my view, there is no adequate explanation for the Plaintiff’s choice of the LFE multiplicand. Such a “rough and ready” mode of assessment for the multiplicand is not the correct method for assessing LFE (as opposed to LEC – see \[40\] below). If this submission was accepted, it would go against the very caution noted by the Court of Appeal in _Linda Shaw_ that the figures for assessing LFE quantum should not be “plucked out of thin air” (see \[24\] above).

35     For these reasons, I decline to award LFE in the Plaintiff’s favour given the absence of concrete and objective evidence showing his post-accident income.

36     I turn now to deal with the Plaintiff’s claim for LEC.

## Loss of earning capacity (LEC)

#### Parties’ submissions

37     The Plaintiff submits that he should be entitled to an LEC of S$75,000 because his disability has rendered him unable to perform even the most basic of tasks expected of junior chefs. His disability would therefore put him at a great disadvantage of competing in the market for his pre-accident job.[^12]

38     The Defendant submits that no award for LEC should be made because the Plaintiff has failed to establish that there was a real and substantial risk of loss of employment given that there was no medical evidence that he would suffer from complete loss of taste and his main skills in restaurant management, apart from tasting, were still intact.[^13]

#### Basic legal principles

39     The Court of Appeal held in _Linda Shaw_ that an award for LEC can only be made where there is a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff could lose his present job at some time before the estimated end of his working life, _and_ that he will, because of his injuries, be at a risk or disadvantage in securing an equivalent job in the open employment market (at \[20\] and \[36\]).

40     As the assessment arises from the court’s perspective on the future, “precise calculation is impossible” (see _Wong Kim Lan v Christie Kolandasamy_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 234</span> (“_Wong Kim Lan_”) at \[11\]). The assessment is therefore “rather rough and ready” and is in essence “an exercise in speculation as often the court does not know the extent to which a plaintiff will be disadvantaged by his disabilities if he has to seek a new position” (_Clark Jonathan Michael v Lee Khee Chung_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 209</span> at \[91\]).

41     LEC can also be assessed “in the round” rather than using the multiplicand/multiplier approach (see _Chang Ah Lek and others v Lim Ah Koon_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 551</span> at \[28\]).

#### Application to the facts

42     Counsel for the Defendant, Mr Srinivasan Selvaraj, argues that an award for LEC should not be made here for two reasons. First, there is no risk of loss of the Plaintiff’s present business with Ruminate and in fact, he would still be able to earn a good living on account of his outstanding management skills. Second, the Plaintiff continued to work with the Tippling Club post-accident and he was also given a salary increase.[^14]

#### The applicable test for awarding LEC

43     Mr Selvaraj’s first submission merits closer consideration as it appears, on face value, to have some support in the Court of Appeal decision of _Linda Shaw_ (at \[36\]):

> … It is trite that an award for loss of earning capacity (in the context _where the plaintiff is currently employed_) can **_only_** be awarded _if there is a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff could lose his or her_ **_present job_** at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life and that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market. It is a _cumulative test_. … \[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

44     While it is true that the Court of Appeal used the language of “present” job, it is significant that the factual matrix in _Linda Shaw_ was of a plaintiff who had _not_, as at the date of assessment, changed her occupation following the accident (see _Linda Shaw_ at \[4\]–\[6\]). That is however not the situation before me.

45     Further, I am guided by the subsequent Court of Appeal’s holding in _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> (“_Lua Bee Kiang_”). In that case, the plaintiff was previously a carpenter but subsequently became employed as a cleaner after the accident. The counsel for the defendant in _Lua Bee Kiang_ made the argument (along the same lines of Mr Selvaraj’s argument) that the plaintiff ought not to be granted LEC because there was no evidence that the plaintiff would lose his present job as a cleaner. In direct response to the submission, it was expressly held by Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA that the relevant question is _not_ whether the plaintiff is “at risk of losing his current, post-accident employment, but whether he has been prevented from competing in the market for his _pre-accident job_” (_Lua Bee Kiang_ at \[50\]; \[emphasis in original\]). This is clearly sound as a matter of principle. There is no good reason to look at the risk of the plaintiff losing his present occupation if he had _changed_ his occupation post-accident. If the law is otherwise, this would disentitle a plaintiff from claiming for LEC if he had opted, following the accident, for a more secure job with little to no risk of unemployment. This would be despite the fact that the plaintiff is no longer able to compete in the market for his pre-accident job.

46     It therefore appears from the above that different tests apply depending on whether or not the plaintiff has _changed_ his occupation after the accident. If there is _no change_ in occupation, the cumulative test stated in _Linda Shaw_ (see \[43\] above) is the governing approach. If there is _any change_ in occupation, the sole requirement that has to be met is whether the plaintiff “has been prevented from competing in the market for his _pre-accident job_” (_Lua Bee Kiang_ at \[50\]).

47     With the above understanding, Mr Selvaraj’s second submission (see \[42\] above) can be easily addressed. As the relevant inquiry is whether the Plaintiff has been prevented from competing for his _pre-accident_ job as a head chef, it matters not that he continued employment with the Tippling Club for a brief period after the accident and/or that his salary had increased. What matters instead is the objective fact that he is no longer a chef and the determination whether, based on the evidence, he is able to compete as a head chef again in the future.

48     In fact, claims for LEC have been allowed in the past where the plaintiff had continued in the same job post-accident and earned an increment (see _Wong Kim Lan_ at \[15\]) and even where the plaintiff was able to secure _other_ higher paying jobs post-accident (see _Pang Tim Fook Paul v Ang Swee Koon and another_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 258</span> (“_Pang Tim_”)). The rationale for doing so was explained in _Pang Tim_ as follows (at \[41\]):

> Although the Plaintiff’s change of employment since the accident has _resulted in higher remuneration and a steady monthly income_, I am of the view that _he is not precluded from pursuing his claim for loss of earning capacity_. On this issue, I derived much guidance from the case of \[_Wong Kim Lan_\] … \[where\], the court stated,

>> ‘Counsel for the defendant submitted that I ought to draw an inference, from the fact that no post-accident accounts were tendered, that the plaintiff’s income had in fact increased since the accident… I was prepared to draw that inference as to her increase in income. _Such an inference does not disentitle the plaintiff to an award for loss of earning capacity, however_. Somewhat ironically, it could lead to an increased award as _the plaintiff’s opportunity cost in giving up the business_ at a later stage is augmented. We were not assessing past business loss, but a _prospective_ pecuniary loss. _The fact that the plaintiff is earning more does not detract from her diminution of earning capacity_. Should the injury force the plaintiff to give up her business, she would suffer loss in going into alternative employment outside her field of talent. It is this loss that we are assessing, not current loss to her business.’

> Hence, rather than suppressing the Plaintiff’s entitlement to an award for loss of earning capacity, his increased income may ironically, lead to an increased award, as the opportunity cost to the Plaintiff in the event that he loses his current employment, is enhanced.

> \[emphasis added\]

Simply put, increase in income post-accident and/or a stable post-accident employment do not operate as a bar to claiming LEC. This is because if the plaintiff loses his post-accident job for whatever reasons, his injury would place him at a disadvantage in competing for his pre-accident job. That is precisely what an award for LEC seeks to compensate, _ie_, damages for the debilitated ability of the plaintiff to compete in the market for the _pre-accident job_.

49     Before I turn to the facts, I highlight another relevant factor that has been noted in the case law. It has been said that one “crucial factor” in assessing LEC is “what the disability meant to the plaintiff’s chosen employment, with reference to the skill set necessary to sustain that employment” (_Wong Kim Lan_ at \[16\]). In _Wong Kim Lan_, the plaintiff was self-employed as a jewellery designer and heavily relied on the health of her back when selecting diamonds and designing jewellery. Valerie Thean DJ (as she then was) noted that while the plaintiff’s back disability “may not be important for someone in another line of work, for the plaintiff, at each step, her back posed a special challenge” (_Wong Kim Lan_ at \[16\]).

#### Whether an award for LEC is appropriate

50     From the above, it is clear that the pertinent question is therefore whether the Plaintiff has been prevented or disadvantaged as a result for the Injury from competing in the market for his pre-accident job as a head chef of a fine dining restaurant. On this basis, I find that an award for LEC is warranted in the present case for the following reasons.

51     First, I am persuaded by the medical evidence given by the expert witness for the Plaintiff, Dr Tan Ban Guan Andrew (“Dr Tan”) from the National Dental Centre Singapore. Even though Dr Tan declined to express a conclusive view on the impact of the Plaintiff’s Injury to his career choice as a chef, he was of the view that the Injury could cause the Plaintiff to effectively lose a proper and wholesome sense of taste:[^15]

> Q:My learned friend suggested that the tip of the tongue is still functional in this case. Based on the plaintiff’s patient history and his complaints, how did the injury affect this patient’s taste?

> A:Given the state of his nerves found in surgery, we expect that the taste would be absent in the right side of the tongue. We expect him to still have taste on the left side but **_the appreciation of taste and flavours depends on a global integration of both taste buds and sensation in both sides of the tongue_** and appreciation of taste in the flavours in the palate and nose. We have no way of ascertaining the true personal impact of loss of taste in half of his tongue except for what he explains. I can only say that his explanation of his symptoms and his loss of functionality is plausible.

> \[emphasis added\]

2       Given that there is injury to the right side of the Plaintiff’s tongue, this would hinder the Plaintiff’s ability to have a balanced sense of taste which would in turn affect his overall technical culinary skills. While the medical evidence may not be conclusive to suggest that it will be impossible for him to be a chef again, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that he would clearly not be as competent in this job as another chef who has fully functioning taste buds.

52     Second, his former colleagues’ recount of the Plaintiff’s behaviours in the months following the Injury is of especial importance. Both Ms Betty Chan Shock Lin (“Betty”) and Mr Tay Ming Wei Glen (“Glen”) described the Plaintiff to have been a very talented and accomplished chef[^16] and affirmed that the Plaintiff was not able to function at his previous ability and capacity at work following the Injury. For instance, Glen, who was the sous-chef to the Plaintiff when the latter was the head chef, recounted an occasion following the Injury where the Plaintiff approved a dish to be served even though it was “way too salty”.[^17] Glen further stated as follows:[^18]

> The next day, _I decided to test Paul \[ie, the Plaintiff\] and prepared two dishes- one extremely salty and the other unsalted- for him to taste._ **_Paul was unable to differentiate between the dishes_****.** I was horrified. It was obvious that something had gone horribly wrong during the wisdom tooth extraction and I feared that this would affect Paul’s performance at work. For a chef to lose even part of his sense of taste is devastating- the ability to taste is such an integral aspect of our job and is critical when we decide on what produce to buy, create new dishes which requires us to taste constantly to refine the dishes and ultimately, when we cook and serve food to our guests. Personally, I cannot imagine how to be a chef if my sense of taste was impaired.

> …Paul’s performance \[continued to go\] through the ground. _I had to taste everything for him everyday_ and he could only watch if the cooks were doing something wrong. **_He had lost his ability to function effectively as a chef_** and with that, his self-confidence took a beating. For a head chef who was used to having the final say and wanted nothing more than to lead the team, I could tell that Paul was struggling and getting increasingly disheartened.

> \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

53     As for Betty, she was the personal assistant to the Chief Executive Officer of the group that owned the Tippling Club and had worked closely with the Plaintiff from 2011 to 2015.[^19] Betty had averred that:[^20]

> As the PA to the CEO, I was also aware that there were other crucial aspects of his role as head chef that Paul \[_ie_, the Plaintiff\] struggled to perform after the injury he sustained as a result of the wisdom tooth procedure. In particular, Paul was required to ensure that the dishes that are served are consistent in terms of flavour and temperature and to develop new menus. It became apparent that _Paul was struggling with these roles and relied very heavily on sous chefs_. The requests from the CEO for Paul to create new menus for other restaurants also stopped, and the interaction between him the CEO became infrequent. \[emphasis added\]

54     From the above account, it is clear that the Plaintiff’s work as head chef with the Tippling Club was severely compromised as a result of the Injury. It therefore comes as no surprise that both Glen and Betty stated that the Plaintiff had little choice but to resign from the Tippling Club in December 2015.[^21]

55     Given that the Defendant consented to the admission of the affidavits filed by Betty and Glen and elected not to call them as witnesses for cross-examination during the AD Hearing, I am minded to accept their evidence of how the Plaintiff’s performance deteriorated at work following the Injury (see also Jeffery Pinsler, SC, _Evidence and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) at paras 20.096 and 20.101).

56     Overall, to accept the Defendant’s submission would be to disregard both the factual and expert evidence which together show that the Plaintiff has become handicapped in his sense of taste. The nature of the Plaintiff’s post-accident employment also strongly suggests that he could not sustain or compete for the role of head chef in the fine dining industry any longer and that his disability has created significant challenges for him to remain employable as a chef (see \[7\]–\[10\] above).

57     In short, the Plaintiff’s career trajectory in the traditional chef’s role has effectively been pulled from under his feet. He is unable to meaningfully continue in the career which he trained for since he was 19 years old and for which he had remarkable talent and skill. Although he has now embarked on a new path as a consultant with Ruminate, the realities and challenges of business management, which are relatively new to him, could place him at a risk of unemployment in the future whereupon he would be at a clear disadvantage for competing for the job of a chef, let alone as a head chef. It is this loss that I am assessing here.

#### Appropriate quantum for LEC

58     In assessing the quantum for LEC, it is helpful to refer to past precedents to “ensure that the amounts assessed are broadly consistent and in line with previous awards made for similarly-situated plaintiffs” (see _Practitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages_ at para 4-27). Having referred to these cases, the Plaintiff submits for a figure of S$75,000 to represent the LEC in this case.[^22] I find this figure to be in line with the precedents and, in my judgment, the sum of S$75,000 submitted for is, in fact, rather conservative in view of the past precedents. I will highlight three relevant cases here.

59     In _Karuppiah Nirmala v Singapore Bus Services Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 934</span> (“_Nirmala_”), the 42-year-old plaintiff found it difficult after an accident to cope with her job as an editor, which paid her S$4,300 a month (see _Nirmala_ at \[21\]). She thus resigned from the job and went back to her previous career in pre-school education on a part-time basis, earning S$2,500 a month. The AR awarded pre-trial loss of earnings and LFE based on S$1,500 a month. On appeal, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) upheld the pre-trial loss of earnings award but set aside the LFE award in favour of an LEC award given that the she was currently pursuing her vocation in which she had adequate training and experience, and was comparable to her editor’s work. In essence, it had not affected her ability to exploit those skills profitably. The editing path was new to the plaintiff and it was not possible to be certain that she would have continued in that line. The court awarded her S$70,000 for LEC (at \[33\]). In making the award, the court acknowledged that whilst her injuries meant that an editing career would be difficult to maintain, it had not affected her main skills or ability to exploit those skills profitably (at \[31\]). Notably, the Plaintiff’s pre-accident income was similar to that of the plaintiff in _Nirmala_ and he is also much younger than her. Further, unlike the plaintiff in _Nirmala_, the Plaintiff here has suffered the loss of a fundamental aspect of his professional expertise.

60     In _Low Swee Tong v Liew Machinery (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 10</span> (“_Low_”), the plaintiff met with an accident and suffered from haemarthrosis and osteoarthritis at the knee. He was then 20 years old and was earning about S$800 to S$900 per month as a vehicle mechanic (see _Low_ at \[17\]). While there was no evidence that the plaintiff had been incapacitated from working as a mechanic, the evidence was that the onset of osteoarthritis would necessarily interfere with his work (at \[43\]). A sum of S$55,000 was awarded for LEC in _Low_ (at \[44\]). Even though the plaintiff in _Low_ was younger than the Plaintiff, greater weight has to be given to the Plaintiff’s significantly higher pre-accident income of S$4,350.

61     Lastly, in the case of _Tan Hun Boon_ (the facts of this case have been summarised above at \[25\]), Pang JC awarded the plaintiff a sum of S$150,000 for LEC. Pang JC arrived at this figure based on the past precedents, the fact that the plaintiff was earning close to S$100,000 per year before the accident and the fact that he had a remaining working life of 28 years (the plaintiff was 34 years old at the time of accident and 39 years old at the time of trial) (see _Tan Hun Boon_ at \[140\]). Even though the Plaintiff’s pre-accident income was lower than the plaintiff in _Tan Hun Boon_, the Plaintiff’s income had risen close to that level of income few months after the accident (see \[7\] above). The Plaintiff is also seven years younger than the plaintiff in _Tan Hun Boon_.

62     For the aforesaid reasons and primarily on account of the Plaintiff’s submission on quantum, I award the Plaintiff S$75,000 for LEC.

## Conclusion

63     I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim for LFE but allow the claim for LEC for the sum of S$75,000.

64     As per the parties’ agreement, I also award the Plaintiff general damages for pain and suffering for the Injury in the sum of S$30,000 and special damages for medical and transportation expenses in the sum of S$2,066.60.

65     Parties have indicated that they would like to furnish written submissions on costs and interest in respect of the suit and related interlocutory applications. The submissions are to be filed and exchanged within a week and will be dealt with separately.
