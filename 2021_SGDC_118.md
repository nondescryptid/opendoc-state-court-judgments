\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 11/2021.\]

28 June 2021

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants is for the sum of $115,000, being annual maintenance payments provided for under the will of the plaintiffs’ father. The defendants have a counterclaim seeking three declarations. Two declarations relate to the annual maintenance payments, while the third declaration relate to payments for the plaintiffs’ education, medical expenses or benefit under the will.

2       I allowed the plaintiffs’ claim. The defendants’ counterclaims were dismissed, except for the third declaration which I allowed. The defendants have appealed against my decision. There is no appeal by the plaintiffs.

## Facts

3       The plaintiffs are the daughters of GDV (“the deceased”) and his former wife, GDQ (“the plaintiffs’ mother”).[^1] The deceased and the plaintiffs’ mother divorced in January 2015. The plaintiffs are all minors and are represented in this action by their mother.

4       The first defendant is the sister of the deceased. The second defendant married the deceased, after his divorce.[^2]

5       In 2016, the deceased was very ill with leukaemia.[^3] He instructed Legal Solutions LLC to draft his will. In November 2016, the deceased executed his will (“the Will”), which provides that the defendants are the executrixes and trustees of the Will.[^4] Less than a year thereafter, the deceased passed away.[^5]

6       Clause 4 of the Will provides for maintenance payments of $15,000 per year to be made to each of the four plaintiffs.[^6] The total amount to be paid to the four plaintiffs under clause 4 of the Will is $60,000 per year.

7       The provision for maintenance made by the deceased in clause 4 of the Will, follows an order of court dated 30 January 2015 in the divorce proceedings. This order of court provides that “The \[deceased\] shall pay \[the plaintiffs’ mother\] a sum of $5,000 as monthly maintenance for the \[plaintiffs\]” (“the Maintenance Order”).[^7] The annual maintenance to be paid for the four plaintiffs under the Maintenance Order amounts to $60,000 per year. The annual maintenance to be paid to the plaintiffs under clause 4 of the Will, ties in with the annual maintenance to be paid for the plaintiffs under the Maintenance Order.

8       The plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants is for the sum of $115,000, from the estate of the deceased, being maintenance payments to the plaintiffs under clause 4 of the Will, for 2017 and 2018, less the sum of $5,000 that was paid to the plaintiffs in September 2017.[^8]

9       The defendants’ position is that the maintenance payments under clause 4 of the Will are residuary legacies subject to clause 3 of the Will, and cannot be distributed until the debts of the estate have been paid.[^9] Clause 3 of the Will provides for the distribution of two properties, and for the balance of the estate to be distributed as follows:

> (a)     41% of the balance of the estate to be distributed to the second defendant, and

> (b)     59% of the balance of the estate to be distributed to the plaintiffs.[^10]

10     The relevant extracts of clauses 3 and 4 of the Will are as follows:

> 3.    Subject to the payment of my debts, loans, funeral and testamentary expenses, I GIVE all my real and personal property to my executrixes and Trustees upon trust to distribute the whole of my Estate … to the beneficiaries of my Estate in the following manner:

>> (i)    to give my 80% share of the property at \[Property 1\] to my spouse, \[the second defendant\] …

>> (ii)   to let my father, … reside at my property at \[Property 2\] for as long as he desires or deems fit, and thereafter should my father … no longer reside in the said property, the property shall be sold and the proceeds are to be divided into three (3) equal shares in the following manner:

>>> a)    One third (1/3) share to my sister, \[the first defendant\], …

>>> b)    One third (1/3) share to my spouse, \[the second defendant\] … and

>>> c)    The last one third (1/3) share to be divided equally between my daughters, \[the four plaintiffs\]

>> (iii)   to distribute the balance of my Estate in the following manner:

>>> a)    41% of the balance of my Estate to my spouse, \[the second defendant\];

>>> b)    10.5% of the balance of my Estate to my daughter \[the first plaintiff\];

>>> c)    13.5% of the balance of my Estate to my daughter \[the second plaintiff\];

>>> d)    16.5% of the balance of my Estate to my daughter \[the third plaintiff\]; and

>>> e)    18.5% of the balance of my Estate, to my daughter \[the fourth plaintiff\].

> 4.    In the event that any of my daughters, \[the four plaintiffs\] are at the date of my demise under the age of 24, my Trustees shall distribute S$15,000 per year to such daughter(s) for their maintenance until they attain the age of 24, and hold the said share(s) of my Estate on TRUST for my daughter or daughters (as the case may be) until such time that she attains the age of 24 whereupon it shall then be distributed to my daughter(s) in accordance with my Will provided always that my Trustees may use any such amounts or portion of the said share(s) for my daughter(s)' education, medical expenses or benefit, and the residue of my Estate shall accrue for the benefit of my daughter or daughters (as the case may be) when she turns 24 years of age in the share(s) stipulated at Clause 3 above.

11     The plaintiffs’ position is that the annual maintenance payments under clause 4 of the Will are pecuniary legacies which are not subject to clause 3 of the Will.[^11]

12     Essentially, the key difference between the parties’ respective positions is as follows:

> (a)     The plaintiffs’ position would mean that the annual maintenance payments would be paid to the plaintiffs under clause 4, in priority to the distribution of the estate under clause 3.

> (b)     In contrast, the defendants’ position would mean that the annual maintenance payments would be carved out from the plaintiffs’ share of the estate under clause 3.

13     The plaintiffs further take the position that the defendants have assented to the distribution of the annual maintenance for the period of two years for 2017 and 2018. This arises from correspondence between the defendants’ solicitors and the plaintiffs’ solicitors relating to an application to empower the plaintiffs’ mother to give good discharge for all payments to the plaintiffs under the Will.[^12] In particular, in a letter dated 15 February 2019 from the defendants’ solicitors to the plaintiffs’ solicitors, the defendants’ position was that “the \[defendants\] intend to pay the sum of S$115,000 for all 4 children for \[that two year period\].”[^13]

14     The defendants now take the position that the debts of the deceased have to be paid before any distribution. They claim that there are mortgages on the two properties[^14] and tax to be paid on the shares of an American company sold by the estate.[^15] They also claim that there are sums to be paid to the plaintiffs’ mother following the divorce proceedings.[^16] However, the defendants have not adduced evidence to show that the assets of the estate less the liabilities of the estate, is less than $115,000.

15     In addition to resisting the plaintiffs’ claim for the sum of $115,000, the defendants seek three declarations in their counterclaim. Two of these declarations relate to the annual maintenance payments as follows:

> (1)    A declaration that the payment of any and all of the Annual Maintenance shall be subject to the Estate’s payment of the Deceased’s debts and loans, as well as costs and expenses associated with the administration of the Estate as may be entitled to be deducted under law, from the estate fund;

> (2)    A declaration that the Annual Maintenance is to be drawn from each of the Plaintiffs’ respective legacies as set out in Clause 3 of the Will; … [^17]

16     The third declaration that the defendants seek, is that “the Plaintiffs’ educational and medical expenses are to be drawn from each of the Plaintiffs’ respective legacies as set out in Clause 3 of the Will.”[^18]

17     The parties agreed that the matter be heard as a documents only trial and that the parties would rely on the affidavits of evidence-chief filed, without the need for the deponents of the affidavits of evidence-in-chief to give oral evidence in court.

## Issues

18     The key issues arising from this case are:

> (a)     Whether the annual maintenance payments are pecuniary legacies or residuary legacies.

> (b)     Whether the defendants assented to the payment of the sum of $115,000 to the plaintiffs.

## Whether the maintenance payments are pecuniary or residuary legacies

19     In Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore: Probate, Administration and Succession (Lexis Nexis 2013) (“Halsbury”) at \[190.106\], legacies are divided into the following five categories:

> (a)     specific legacies,

> (b)     general legacies,

> (c)     demonstrative legacies,

> (d)     pecuniary legacies, and

> (e)     residuary legacies.

20     The last two of the aforesaid five categories are pertinent in this case. Halsbury describes pecuniary legacies as “legacies of sums of money” and residuary legacies as “what remain after the above \[first four categories of\] legacies have been disposed of.”

21     In construing a will, it is necessary to first look at the wording of the will itself. In _Foo Jee Seng v Foo Jhee Tuang_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 339</span> at \[17\], the Court of Appeal held:

>     It is clear that the overriding aim of the court in construing a will is to seek and give effect to the testamentary intention as expressed by the testator. This intention must predominantly be derived from the wording of the will itself, although the circumstances prevailing at the time the will was executed may be taken into account. …

### The wording of the Will

22     Clause 4 of the Will provides for the annual maintenance payments to the plaintiffs.[^19] The clause provides as follows:

>     In the event that any of my daughters, \[the four plaintiffs\] are at the date of my demise under the age of 24, my Trustees shall distribute S$15,000 per year to such daughter(s) for their maintenance until they attain the age of 24, and hold the said share(s) of my Estate on TRUST for my daughter or daughters (as the case may be) until such time that she attains the age of 24 whereupon it shall then be distributed to my daughter(s) in accordance with my Will provided always that _my Trustees may use any such amounts or portion of the said share(s) for my daughter(s)' education, medical expenses or benefit, and the residue of my Estate shall accrue for the benefit of my daughter or daughters (as the case may be) when she turns 24 years of age in the share(s) stipulated at Clause 3 above_. \[emphasis added\]

23     Clause 4 may be divided into the following three parts:

> (a)     the annual maintenance provision,

> (b)     the provision for the plaintiffs’ shares to be held on trust until they attain the age of 24, and

> (c)     the provision for the trustees to use the plaintiffs’ shares for their education, medical expenses or benefit.

24     For ease of reading, I set out the aforesaid three parts of clause 4 as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.74%"> <col width="75.26%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Extract from clause</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Annual maintenance provision</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">In the event that any of my daughters, [the four plaintiffs] are at the date of my demise under the age of 24, my Trustees shall distribute S$15,000 per year to such daughter(s) for their maintenance until they attain the age of 24,</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Provision for the plaintiffs’ shares to be held on trust until they attain the age of 24</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">and hold the said share(s) of my Estate on TRUST for my daughter or daughters (as the case may be) until such time that she attains the age of 24 whereupon it shall then be distributed to my daughter(s) in accordance with my Will</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Provision for education, medical expenses or benefit</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">provided always that <em>my Trustees may use any such amounts or portion of the said share(s) for my daughter(s)' education, medical expenses or benefit, and the residue of my Estate shall accrue for the benefit of my daughter or daughters (as the case may be) when she turns 24 years of age in the share(s) stipulated at Clause 3 above</em>. [emphasis added]</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

25     The defendants are seeking to rely on the last part of clause 4 which provides that “my Trustees may use any such amounts or portion of the said share(s) for my daughter(s)’ education, medical expenses or benefit, and the residue of my Estate shall accrue for the benefit of my daughter or daughters (as the case may be) when she turns 24 years of age in the share(s) stipulated at Clause 3 above”, to support their position that the maintenance payments of $15,000 per year set out at the start of clause 4, is a residuary legacy.

26     I disagree with the defendants’ interpretation for the following reasons:

> (a)     Although clause 4 of the Will refers to “residue of my Estate”,[^20] this clearly applies to the last part of the clause which deals with the plaintiffs’ shares in the estate being used for their “education, medical expenses or benefit”, rather than the first part of the clause which deals with the plaintiffs’ annual maintenance.

> (b)     Furthermore, the first part of the clause dealing with the annual maintenance does not refer to the annual maintenance being used from the said shares, unlike the last part which expressly provides that “my Trustees may use any such amounts or portion of the said share(s) for my daughter(s)’ education, medical expenses or benefit”.

27     In the premises, I find that the wording of the Will itself, points towards the annual maintenance payments under clause 4 of the Will being pecuniary legacies, which are not subject to clause 3 of the Will.

### Circumstances when the Will was executed

28     The defendants have sought to rely on an email dated 26 July 2016 to the deceased,[^21] wherein the solicitors for the deceased referred to a hypothetical sum of $100,000 that may be distributed to each plaintiff under clause 3. The relevant extract from this email is as follows:

>     For example, if your daughter at age 21 has $100,000 in total from your Estate, your executrixes may distribute S$15,0000 to her for her maintenance for that year, but should she require an additional S$20,0000 (e.g. she is enrolled in a foreign university with higher school fees), your executrixes will be able to use such monies from her share of S$100,000 from your Estate to pay for her _university fees_. \[emphasis added\]

29     The defendants’ interpretation of this email is that both the annual maintenance of $15,000 and the hypothetical sum of $20,000 for education are to be deducted from the aforesaid sum of $100,000.[^22] I disagree with this interpretation. The email states the defendants “will be able to use such monies from \[each plaintiff’s\] share of S$100,000 from \[the deceased’s\] Estate to pay for her university fees”, refers only to payment for education (in this case university fees) from the sum of $100,000, rather than education and maintenance to be paid from the sum of $100,000. In the premises, I am of the view that this email does not show that the annual maintenance of $15,000 is to be deducted from the plaintiffs’ residual legacy under clause 3.

30     I would further point out that it makes little sense for the $15,000 to be drawn from the hypothetical share of $100,000, in view of the ages of the plaintiffs. At the time of the affidavit of evidence-in-chief filed on behalf of the plaintiffs on 28 October 2020, the ages of the plaintiffs ranged from 10 to 17 years.[^23] At the time the deceased passed away in August 2017, [^24] their ages would have ranged from about 7 to 14 years. In the premises, as the aforesaid sum of $100,000 would be fully utilised for maintenance of $15,000 per year in less than 7 years, the sum of $100,000 would be fully depleted well before any of the plaintiffs attain the age of 24 years. This could not have been the intention of the deceased at the time he executed the Will in November 2016, less than a year before he passed away.

31     Furthermore, the annual maintenance payments under clause 4 of the Will reflect the total maintenance payments per year to be paid under the Maintenance Order. To ensure compliance with the Maintenance Order, it would be logical for the annual maintenance payments under Clause 4 of the Will, to be paid out in priority to the distribution under clause 3 of the Will.

32     Moreover, in an email dated 8 July 2016 from Legal Solutions LLC to the deceased, Legal Solutions LLC suggested that a monthly sum of $1,250 be paid to each plaintiff, from each plaintiff’s share of the estate. This monthly sum of $1,250 is equivalent to the annual maintenance of $15,000. The suggested clause for the first plaintiff provided for “11% of the _balance of my Estate_ to \[the first plaintiff\] to be paid out monthly in the sum of S$1,250 per month”[^25] (emphasis added). There were similar clauses suggested for each of the other plaintiffs. The express link between “balance of my estate” and the monthly maintenance payments in this suggested clause makes it clear that the maintenance payments are to be carved out from each plaintiff’s share of the estate, yet this proposed wording did not make it to the final will that was executed by the deceased. I am of the view that this wording would have been kept, if it was in fact the intention of the deceased to carve out the annual maintenance from each plaintiff’s share of the estate. The fact that this wording was not kept, is a further factor against the defendants’ interpretation of the Will.

33     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I agreed with the plaintiffs that the annual maintenance payments under clause 4 of the Will are pecuniary legacies and are not subject to clause 3 of the Will.

## Whether the defendants assented to the payment of $115,000 to the plaintiffs

34     The plaintiffs further take the position that the defendants have assented to the payment of the sum of $115,000 to the plaintiffs.

35     In _Seah Teong Kang v Seah Yong Chwan_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 792</span> at \[25\], the Court of Appeal held:

>     An _assent_ is an acknowledgment by a personal representative that an asset of the deceased is no longer required for the payment of the debts of the estate, funeral expenses or general pecuniary legacies … Where the facts disclose that there has been an assent, then its _effect_, in the context of a specific bequest under a will, is to turn the executor into a _trustee_ of the bequeathed asset because _equitable_ ownership _moves to the specific legatees upon the assent_ who, for their part, are turned into _beneficiaries_ … From that point onwards, the executor is precluded from dealing with the bequeathed asset as executor ... \[emphasis in original\]

36     In the light of the following correspondence exchanged between the plaintiffs’ solicitors and the defendants’ solicitors on an application to court for the plaintiffs’ mother to be empowered to give good discharge for payments to the plaintiffs under the Will, I am of the view that the defendants have assented to the payment of the aforesaid sum of $115,000 to the plaintiffs:

> (a)     In a letter dated 15 February 2019, the defendants’ solicitors stated “we write to confirm that the \[defendants\] intend to pay the sum of S$115,000 for all 4 children for the periods \[from 30August 2017 to 29 August 2018 and 30 August 2018 to 29 August 2019\].”[^26]

> (b)     The draft affidavit in support of the aforesaid application, which was sent to the defendants for their comments and consent, stated that each plaintiff is entitled to the sum of $28,750 for the aforesaid period, with a total of $115,000 to be paid to the four plaintiffs ($28,750 x 4).[^27] This part of the affidavit relating to the payment of $115,000 was not disputed by the defendants’ solicitors in their letter of 31 May 2019.[^28]

> (c)     In a letter dated 16 August 2019, the defendants’ solicitors stated “the maintenance payments to date may be paid out prior to the crystallisation of the Estate”.[^29] Although the defendants’ solicitors raised that “subsequent maintenance payment may only be paid out if estimates show that the Estate has sufficient funds to meet the payment of its debts/expenses”, this qualification only pertains to the subsequent maintenance payments, not the earlier maintenance payment of $115,000.

37     The aforesaid correspondence shows that the defendants had considered the debts of the estate and ascertained that the sum of $115,000 could be paid to the plaintiffs, without affecting their ability to pay the aforesaid debts. I further note that notwithstanding that the Grant of Probate was issued on 2 February 2018,[^30] the defendants have yet to adduce any evidence that the value of the assets of the estate less the value of the debts of the estate, is lower than the sum of $115,000.

38     The defendants have sought to rely on the old English cases of _Deeks v Strutt_ (1794) 5 TR 690 and _Holland v Clark_ (1842) 1 Y & CCC 151, where the court found that pecuniary legatees had no right of action against the executors.[^31] The plaintiffs have pointed out that these cases were so decided because of the differing jurisdiction of the courts of law and the courts of equity, whereas under section 3 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed), law and equity are to be administered concurrently.[^32] I agree with the plaintiffs that in view of section 3 of the Civil Law Act, the aforesaid cases relied upon by the defendants are not applicable.

39     Accordingly, I agree with the plaintiffs that the defendants have assented to the payment of the sum of $115,000 to the plaintiffs.

## Conclusion

40     In the premises, judgment was entered for the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the sum of $115,000 from the estate of the deceased.

41     In the light of my aforesaid findings, the declarations relating to the annual maintenance payments, which the defendants seek in prayers 1 and 2 of the defendants’ counterclaim, were dismissed.

42     As for prayer 3 of the defendants’ counterclaim for “A declaration that the Plaintiffs’ educational and medical expenses are to be drawn from each of the Plaintiffs’ respective legacies as set out in Clause 3 of the Will”, clause 4 of the Will expressly provides that the defendants “may use any such amounts or portion of the \[plaintiffs’\] share(s) for \[the plaintiffs’\] education, medical expenses or benefit”.[^33] In the premises, the declaration sought by the defendants in prayer 3 of their counterclaim was allowed.

43     As the plaintiffs succeeded in their claim and substantially succeeded in resisting the defendants’ counterclaim, I awarded costs in favour of the plaintiffs.

44     After I delivered my decision, counsel for the defendants asked whether a narrower order could be made under prayer 1 of the defendants’ counterclaim, confining the declaration to annual maintenance payments, subsequent to the first two years’ annual maintenance. I pointed out that this changed the scope of the declaration that the defendants were seeking.

45     Counsel for the plaintiffs stated that he would have to take his clients’ instructions on this narrower declaration. He stated his clients’ position that the subsequent annual maintenance should be carved out from the estate in priority to other beneficiaries, but may be subject to the debts of the estate. He further stated that the defendants should proceed with an application to amend, if the defendants wished to narrow prayer 1 of the counterclaim.

46     I directed parties to consider if they were able to agree on the proposed amendments to prayer 1. Parties were given liberty to apply but to date, no such application has been made.

47     In view of the aforesaid position taken by counsel for the plaintiffs that subsequent annual maintenance payments may be subject to the debts of the estate, the need for the narrower declaration proposed by the defendants may be hypothetical. It is long established that a court in Singapore will not answer hypothetical questions – see the recent Court of Appeal decision in _Republic of India v Vedanta Resources plc_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 50</span> at \[31\]. The defendants may wish to take this into consideration in deciding whether to pursue the narrower declaration which they raised after I had delivered my decision.
