Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases – Loss of amenities

26 October 2022

### District Judge Thian Yee Sze:

1       These are the brief reasons for my decision in Registrar’s Appeal No 74 of 2022, which I shall supplement, if needed.

## Background to the appeal

2       This is an appeal by the Defendant in respect of only one item – namely, loss of amenities – of the Deputy Registrar’s award in the assessment of damages arising out of a road traffic accident. The Defendant drove a car which knocked down the Deceased, Chan Cheong Sam, as she crossed a Senior Citizen Crossing Zone in Marine Terrace in the late morning of 4 January 2019. She was 80 years old at the time of the accident, and passed away on 9 October 2020, some 646 days after the accident. Interlocutory judgment was entered by consent on 8 June 2021 for the Plaintiff for 75% of the damages to be assessed.

3       In delivering his decision on 5 September 2022, the Deputy Registrar below made the following findings which have not been appealed against by either party:

> (a)     That the Deceased’s death was not caused by the accident (at Notes of Evidence (“NE”), 5 September 2022, 6/C – D. The claims that were contingent on the Deceased’s death such as the costs of bereavement and funeral expenses were thus disallowed.

> (b)     That the Plaintiff did not prove the claim for damages for pain and suffering (at NE, 5 September 2022, 8/B – 9/E. There was hence no award made for the heads of claim for pain and suffering – see the table of award at NE, 5 September 2022, 11/C – D.

> (c)     That it was undisputed that the Deceased was originally in a coma after the accident but her condition under the Glasgow Coma Scale later improved to E4VTM5 after she regained some semblance of consciousness (at NE, 5 September 2022, 8/E).

> (d)     That as of the date of the accident, the Deceased was reduced to a vegetative state and was expected to remain so for the rest of her life (at NE, 5 September 2022, 10/A).

4       The Defendant has appealed against the Deputy Registrar’s award of $100,000 for loss of amenities. While the Defendant accepts that the Deputy Registrar was correct in making an award for loss of amenities, his position is that the amount awarded was too high as it did not take into account the length of time the Deceased was deprived of those amenities. The Defendant also contended that the Deputy Registrar did not explain how he adjusted for “inflation compounded over 20 years”.

5       The Plaintiff has not appealed against the Deputy Registrar’s decision.

## The law governing claims for loss of amenities _vs_ pain and suffering

6       While they may sometimes be awarded as a lump sum under a single head of award, damages for pain and suffering and damages for loss of amenities compensate for different types of loss. Pain and suffering refers to both the physical pain, as well as the mental and emotional suffering arising from the injury: see the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Tan Kok Lam (next friend to Teng Eng) v Hong Choon Peng_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 1 SLR(R) 786</span> at \[30\]. On the other hand, loss of amenities refers to the loss of the ability to live a full life which, apart from his injury, the injured person could have done. Examples of loss of amenities for which the courts have allowed compensation include marriage prospects, sexual relations and the ability to pray (see, for example, _Rahman Lutfar v Scanpile Constructors Pte Ltd_ and anor <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 41</span>). It is hence clear that an award for “pain and suffering” and that for “loss of amenities” are meant to compensate for different aspects of the loss sustained by the claimant arising out of the injuries inflicted upon him by the tortfeasor.

7       The Court of Appeal in _Tan Kok Lam_ also made clear another distinction between these two heads of loss: that while no damages are allowed for pain and suffering which is not felt as the claimant is unconscious and hence not able to feel the pain or suffering, the claimant will still be entitled to damages for loss of amenities if there is such loss determined objectively, independently from an appreciation of that loss by the claimant. The court explained the reason for this distinction at \[28\]:

> We recognise and accept that for a claim for pain and suffering, unconsciousness on the part of the victim would negative that claim and thus render an award in respect of that claim inappropriate. A claim for pain necessarily suggests that the victim has consciousness, otherwise there is no question of him enduring any pain for which he should be compensated. However, the same cannot be said for loss of amenities. Whether or not there is loss of amenities is an objective fact. It cannot and should not depend on an appreciation of the loss by the victim. Perhaps the point can be better illustrated by a simple example, where in an accident the victim not only loses a leg, he also loses his mental faculty. Are we to say that because the victim cannot appreciate his present condition, no substantive award should be made even for the loss of the leg? We should think not. Has he not lost the ability to move about freely, even with the help of an artificial limb? And if a substantive award should be made for the loss of the leg, why should it be otherwise for the complete loss of the mental faculty? … we think there is no greater injury or loss, as far as a living person is concerned, than to be turned into a cabbage.

8       In _Tan Juay Mui (by his next friend Chew Chwee Kin) v Sher Kuan Hock and ors_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 496</span>, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) explained that what the Court of Appeal was saying in the above passage in _Tan Kok Lam_ was that “the greatest loss of amenities that a living person can suffer was to be put into a vegetative state and such loss must be properly compensated although the sufferer would not be entitled to a substantial award for pain and suffering due to his inability to feel the same.” (at \[30\]).

9       In essence, an award for pain and suffering depends upon the claimant’s personal awareness of pain and suffering, while an award for loss of amenities is awarded for the fact of deprivation – a substantial loss, whether the claimant is aware of it or not.

10     In his written and oral submissions before me, the Plaintiff’s counsel appeared to conflate the claims for pain and suffering with loss of amenities. He argued that the concepts of pain and suffering and loss of amenities were similar and were fused. As I have explained above, they compensate for different types of loss. The Plaintiff’s counsel also framed the issue on appeal in paragraph 10 of his written submissions as being “against the assessment of a global sum of $100,000 as the general damages for all the injuries sustained by the Plaintiff, as per paragraph 6” of his written submissions. All the heads of claim listed in paragraph 6i – vi related to those for pain and suffering, for which the Deputy Registrar made no award (see NE, 5 September 2022, 11/C - D). The award of $100,000 was for loss of amenities, not pain and suffering. I note that the Plaintiff has not appealed against the Deputy Registrar’s decision in respect of the claims for pain and suffering.

## My decision

11     Bearing in mind the principles laid down in _Tan Kok Lam_, I now turn to the facts and evidence in the case before me. In _Tan Kok Lam_, the life expectancy of the 67 year-old victim was reduced, and “while she might live beyond five years she will not live up to ten years” (at \[2\]). The Court of Appeal awarded $80,000 for loss of amenities. Similar to the plaintiff in _Tan Kok Lam_, the Deceased here was in a vegetative state, albeit for a shorter time, from the date of the accident to the date of her passing 646 days or 1 year and 10 months later.

12     While I agree with the Deputy Registrar’s reliance on the sum awarded in _Tan Kok Lam_ as a starting point in determining the sum to be awarded here given the analogous factual scenario involved, I do not agree with his reasoning for arriving at an award of $100,000. The Deputy Registrar considered that while the loss of amenities suffered by the Deceased was for a shorter period of time than that in _Tan Kok Lam_, where the victim was expected to live for at least five years, “a linear reduction would not be principled in accounting for the loss of amenities which comes from being reduced to a vegetative state”[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). The Deputy Registrar concluded that “(t)he fact remains that as of the date of the accident the Deceased was reduced to a vegetative state and was expected to remain so for the rest of her life.”[^2]

13     To my mind, by the very nature of the loss involved, compensation for loss of amenities would have to be proportional to the length of time that the claimant is deprived of the ability to live life to the fullest, and to enjoy the activities and experiences of living a full life. This would in turn mean that, all things being equal, the longer the life span of the claimant, the larger the amount of compensation. The learned authors of _Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (Third Edition, LexisNexis, 2017) explained that “(I)n assessing the appropriate award of damages for loss of amenities, an important consideration is how long the plaintiff will be deprived of those amenities. Generally, if the plaintiff has to suffer such a loss of amenity for the rest of his life, the courts will need to take into account the plaintiff’s age and his expectation of life.” (at page 71, paragraph 5-42). The authors also explained that in respect of estate claims “(t)he estate may also claim damages for the deceased’s loss of amenities of life up to the time of death. As with the damages for pain and suffering, awards are likely to be small if death follows quickly upon the injury. However, a period of unconsciousness from the time of injury to the time of death, while eliminating recovery for pain and suffering, does not prevent an award of damages for loss of amenities, _See Then Chin Hong & Anor v Thong Hua Sai & Anor_ (Suit No. 923/2012, AD 19/2014)” (at page 123, paragraph 9-23). The amount awarded should hence be proportional to one’s life span or life expectancy.

14     The Deceased was generally in good health. The Defendant does not dispute that she walked unaided, and was independent and generally active for her age. In my view, given that the Deceased was deprived of the amenities of life for about 1 year and 10 months, the amount of time that she was so deprived was about 36% of that experienced by the victim in _Tan Kok Lam_, on the basis that the latter’s life expectancy was at least 5 years. With an uplift given to adjust for the present value of money, an award of $40,000 in the circumstances for loss of amenities would be fair and appropriate.

## Conclusion

15     For the above reasons, the Defendant’s appeal in DC/RA 74 of 2022 is allowed to the extent that the Deputy Registrar’s award for loss of amenities is reduced from $100,000 to $40,000 on a 100% basis.

16     On the issue of costs, having regard to the fact that the Defendant has substantially succeeded in his appeal, as well as the fact that the damages awarded are less than the sum in the Defendant’s Offer to Settle (OTS) dated 30 November 2021, my orders on costs are as follows:

> (a)     Pursuant to Order 22A rule 9, the cost of the action up to the cost of the assessment before the Deputy Registrar is to be awarded as follows:

>> (i)       The Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff a sum of $10,000 from the date of the writ to 30 November 2021.

>> (ii)       The Plaintiff is to pay the Defendant a sum of $11,000 from 1 December 2021 to the date of the judgment before the Deputy Registrar.

> (b)     Pursuant to Order 22A rule 9, the cost of the appeal before me is fixed at $2,500 to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant forthwith.
