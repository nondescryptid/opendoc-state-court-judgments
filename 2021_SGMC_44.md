### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Gayathri Iyer, female, who was 51 years old at the end of trial, faced four maid abuse charges. The offences were alleged to have been committed at Block 132 Tanjong Rhu #XXX, Pebble Bay, Singapore 436919 (“the Pebble Bay unit”) against Thang Khaw Lam (“Lam”). Lam, a Myanmar national, was employed as a domestic worker in the accused’s household. The charges were as follows:-

> **MCN-901206-2019 (1st amended charge) (“the first charge”)**

> are charged that you, on or about 30 June 2017, at Block 132 Tanjong Rhu Road, #XXX, Singapore, being a member of the household of the employer of one Thang Khaw Lam, a domestic maid, did voluntarily cause hurt to the said Thang Khaw Lam, to wit, by slapping her on her face, thus causing her bodily pain, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **MCN-901207-2019 (2nd amended charge) (“the second charge”)**

> are charged that you, sometime in October 2017 at or about 10.30 pm, at Block 132 Tanjong Rhu Road, #XXX, Singapore, being a member of the household of the employer of one Thang Khaw Lam, a domestic maid, did voluntarily cause hurt to the said Thang Khaw Lam, to wit, by hitting her on her back with a black coloured frying pan, thus causing her bodily pain, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **MCN-901208-2019 (3rd amended charge) (“the third charge”)**

> are charged that you, sometime on 27 October 2017, at Block 132 Tanjong Rhu Road, #XXX, Singapore, being a member of the household of the employer of one Thang Khaw Lam, a domestic maid, did voluntarily cause hurt to the said Thang Khaw Lam, to wit, by hitting her on her shoulder area, thus causing her bodily pain, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **MCN-901209-2019 (4th amended charge) (“the fourth charge”)**

> are charged that you, on 7 December 2017 at or about 5.45 am, at Blk 132 Tanjong Road, #XXX, Singapore, being a member of the household of the employer of one Thang Khaw Lam, a domestic maid, did voluntarily cause hurt to the said Thang Khaw Lam, _to wit_, by slapping her on the left side of her face, causing her to suffer sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear due to labyrinthine concussion, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       At the end of trial, the accused was acquitted of the first and second charges (MCN-901206-2019 and MCN-901207-2019). The prosecution has appealed against the orders of acquittal.

3       The accused was convicted on the third and fourth charges (MCN-901208-2019 and MCN 901209-2019). She was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for the third charge, and consecutively, to five months’ imprisonment for the fourth charge, giving an aggregate sentence of seven months’ imprisonment. She has appealed against conviction and sentence.

4       I also ordered the accused to pay Lam compensation of $5,333.96, or in default to 30 days’ imprisonment. The defence did not object to the quantum of compensation and has not filed an appeal against this order.

5       The accused has been released on bail pending appeal. Payment on the compensation order has been stayed.

## Background facts

6       The accused (as she was referred to in the Statement of Agreed Facts) lived with her husband Sundararajan Suresh (“Suresh”) (DW3) and their twin children at the Pebble Bay unit. The children were, their son Iyer Narendran (“Narendran”) and daughter Iyer Niveditha (“Niveditha”) (DW2). At the material time, the accused was a homemaker. Suresh was employed by a multi-national company and travelled frequently on business. Narendran was a full-time national serviceman. He was posted to the Central Manpower Base (“CMPB”) and returned home every day. Niveditha was a first-year undergraduate at National University of Singapore (“NUS”). She stayed at the university hostel and generally returned home on weekends and holidays.[^1]

7       Lam worked for the family as a domestic worker from about 28 June 2017 to 12 December 2017, a period of about five and a half months. While Suresh was Lam’s official employer, she received most of her instructions from the accused. Lam was paid a salary of $550.00 per month.

8       At the Pebble Bay unit, the accused and Suresh occupied separate bedrooms, while the children had their own rooms. Lam occupied the utility room behind the kitchen and had her own toilet. She worked six days a week. She had a day off every Sunday, during which she went to Peninsular Plaza, where she attended a beauticians’ course (“the make-up class”). She also ate lunch and dinner there and did some shopping.

9       Sometime around August 2017, the accused and Niveditha had a big fight. Thereafter, the accused became unresponsive, apparently from the effects of alcohol and medication. An ambulance was called for. When she was discharged from hospital, she moved into a rented unit at 121 Meyer Road #XXX, The Makena, Singapore 437932 (“the Makena unit”), which Suresh rented from 10 August 2017 to 9 August 2018. The accused stated that she lived at the Makena from August 2017 to around October 2017. However, she returned to Pebble Bay during the day. When Niveditha came home, the accused would avoid her and go to the Makena unit. Lam was made to work at both the Pebble Bay and Makena units but was not paid any extra salary.[^2]

10     Lam left the Pebble Bay unit on 12 December 2017. The events leading up to that were not in dispute:-[^3]

> (a)     On 6 December 2017, Suresh went on an overseas business trip.

> (b)     On 7 December 2017, the accused went to India. She returned to Singapore on 21 December 2017.

> (c)     On 11 December 2017, Suresh returned to Singapore from his business trip.

> (d)     On 12 December 2017, after Suresh and the two children left the Pebble Bay unit, Lam also left.

11     According to Lam, she left the Pebble Bay unit at about 10.00 a.m. with her handphone and wallet. She sought refuge at the Centre for Domestic Employees (“CDE”) at Peninsular Plaza. The CDE officers brought her to Bedok North Neighbourhood Police Centre where she lodged the First Information Report (“FIR”) (Exhibit P2) at about 4.06 p.m. In her FIR, Lam alleged that she was beaten on several occasions and that she was not given adequate food. The officers took photographs of her injuries (Exhibit P23), but these were ultimately not relevant to the charges. Lam was also brought to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) for a medical examination.[^4]

12     On 12 December 2017, Suresh filed an online police report at 9.14 p.m. (Exhibit P3), when Lam was found missing. He reported that Niveditha informed him that Lam was stealing “petty things”. He stated that he confronted Lam and cautioned her. He also warned her that such behaviour would lead to termination of her contract. He guessed that Lam got scared and fled.

13     On 13 December 2017 at about 1.05 p.m., Lam returned to the Pebble Bay unit with Inspector Eunice Yeo Qi Qi (PW9) and other police officers. Lam retrieved the belongings she left behind. The police seized a frying pan with no handle (Exhibit P5), which was related to the second charge. Photographs of the scene (Exhibit P4) were also taken.

14     On 27 December 2017, the accused handed Lam’s passport and work permit to the then investigating officer ASP Mohamad Fahmi bin Mohamad Sani (PW7). In return, she was given an Acknowledgement Slip (Exhibit P40).

## The case for the prosecution

### Lam’s evidence

15     Lam alleged that she was repeatedly assaulted by the accused from her third day of work. The accused would hit her two to three times a day by slapping her face, ear and shoulder with her hand.[^5] The last assault occurred on 7 December 2017, just before the accused left for India.

16     Initially, Lam did not inform anyone of the abuse. However, after she befriended a person named Pan Yi at the make-up class, she told Pan Yi that the accused had hit her. Pan Yi gave her the handphone number of Ei Thandar Swe (“Ei Thandar”) (PW5), a volunteer at the CDE. Ei Thandar and Lam then exchanged messages. One Sunday, when she was at her make-up class, Ei Thandar came to see her. She showed Ei Thandar a bump on her head. She said that this injury was caused when the accused threw a high heel shoe at her in a fit of anger. After the meeting, they exchanged messages on the Viber platform. Sometimes she would message Ei Thandar immediately after she had been assaulted. She also told her cousin Thang Khaw Tee of the assaults.[^6]

17     Lam made several other allegations against the accused. Her evidence was to the effect that she was overworked and not given sufficient rest. She claimed that she got up at 4.30 a.m. every morning to start work. She only went to bed at 12.30 to 1.00 a.m.. As the accused did not allow her to use a mop, she had to kneel to mop the floor with a towel. She was made to clean the Makena unit almost every day but was not paid for her extra work. Lam alleged that she was not given sufficient food and was malnourished. The accused had locked her in the Pebble Bay unit and kept her passport and work permit.[^7]

18     When Suresh returned from India on 11 December 2017, she went to talk to him. She told him that the accused had beaten her almost every day. She informed him that she wanted to be repatriated or transferred. Suresh informed her to wait until the accused came home. As she feared that things could be worse once the accused returned, she told Suresh that she was going to leave and that she was not to be blamed for anything. She then sent a message to Ei Thandar to say that she would be leaving the Pebble Bay unit the next day.[^8]

### The evidence of Ei Thandar Swe

19     Ei Thandar was a volunteer at the CDE. Like Lam, she was from Myanmar. She testified that after she was alerted by one Thu Zar that Lam had an injury, she went to look for Lam at the make-up class. This was on a Sunday in June or July 2017. She saw a bump on Lam’s head which was “like a potato”. Lam claimed that her employer had hit her. Ei Thandar advised Lam to report the matter to the police, but Lam said that she did not want to do so. Lam wanted to continue working and thought that she should try harder. If she was transferred to another employer, she had to incur agency fees. The new employer might even be worse.[^9]

20     After this meeting, Lam messaged her on the Viber platform to inform her about what was happening. Lam also sent photographs and videos of her injuries. Lam told her that she was abused repeatedly by the accused. In an exchange of messages between 23 to 25 October 2017, Ei Thandar encouraged Lam to report the matter to the police or to the CDE.[^10] She told Lam that she would have to stay in a shelter and that CDE would find her a job. However, Lam was still reluctant to make any report against the accused. Ei Thandar became impatient with Lam and made a rude sexual reference.[^11]

21     On 23 October 2017, Ei Thandar informed Amey, a CDE officer that Lam was being beaten. She also provided Lam’s address and contact details so that CDE could contact Lam if necessary. In the evening of 11 December 2017, Ei Thandar sent a video and a photograph showing Lam’s injuries to Amey. Ei Thandar had originally received these from Lam.[^12]

22     Concurrently, on the evening of 11 December 2017, Ei Thandar engaged in an exchange with another CDE officer named Rebecca, using Facebook Messenger. She sent a video and a photograph showing the injuries suffered by Lam. She informed Rebecca that Lam had been beaten by her employer. Rebecca suggested that Lam could be asked to call the police, but Ei Thandar said that she would ask Lam to go to the CDE office the next day. Rebecca agreed to this.[^13]

### Medical evidence on Lam

23     After Lam made her police report, she was brought to CGH where she was attended to by Dr Edgar Azada Salandanan (“Dr Edgar”) (PW6), a Resident Physician at the A & E Department. He put up a medical report on Lam dated 12 January 2018 (Exhibit P13). Lam complained that she had been repeatedly assaulted by the accused. The last assault was on 7 December 2017 when she was slapped on both ears. Her main complaint was that she had pain and decreased hearing in her left ear because of the assault. She also claimed to have associated giddiness and tinnitus. Dr Edgar performed a hearing test on Lam. As he found her hearing to be impaired, he referred her to the ENT Department.

24     Lam was examined on 3 January 2018 by Dr Lee Tee Sin (“Dr Lee”) (PW2), the Deputy Chief and Consultant at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery, CGH. He put up a medical report on her dated 12 July 2018 (Exhibit P7) and provided an updated version on 13 February 2019 (Exhibit P8).

25     Lam complained of left ear pain, left hearing loss and tinnitus which had gotten better since the day she was assaulted. His physical examination on her showed that all was normal. An audiogram (“the first audiogram”) was done on 3 January 2018 to test Lam’s hearing. This showed that Lam had a mild to moderate left sensorineural hearing loss with normal hearing on the right.[^14]

26     A further audiogram (“the second audiogram”) was performed on Lam on 11 January 2018. Lam informed Dr Lee that she felt that her hearing was better. Based on the audiogram, Dr Lee noticed that her hearing had improved on the left side.[^15]

27     Dr Lee’s diagnosis was that it was likely that Lam suffered a post-traumatic left sensorineural hearing loss due to temporary threshold shift with complete and full recovery. It was his opinion that Lam suffered a labyrinthine concussion, which is a concussion to the labyrinthine system due to trauma.[^16]

## The case for the defence

### The accused’s evidence

28     The accused denied assaulting or ill-treating Lam. She testified that Lam had sufficient food. She would make a simple lunch for Lam and herself or buy lunch for Lam from a nearby food court. Lam could eat whatever the accused made for the family and re-heat leftovers in a microwave. Coke, sprite, milo and 3-in-1 coffee were available for her to drink. She could use the kettle or get hot water from the hot water tap. When the accused travelled, she gave Lam cash and ask her to eat up the vegetables in the fridge.[^17]

29     She gave Lam sufficient rest. On weekdays, Lam would go to bed between 10 to 11 p.m. and wake up between 5.30 to 5.45 a.m.. On Saturdays, she could wake up around two hours later. Lam was allowed to rest from around 12.30 to 4.00 p.m. each day. She was not confined and was free to come and go as she pleased. There was a spare access card for her to use. On Lam’s day off, no fixed time for her return was set, but she was advised to return before dark.[^18]

30     The accused claimed to have a good relationship with Lam. She would regularly “catch up with some talk” with Lam. On one occasion, they watched the Indian movie “Yellow Bird” together. On another occasion, she found Lam crying hysterically as she had sent money home to her mother who was cheated of it. She taught Lam a breathing technique to calm down. She advised Lam not to send money to her family and offered to help her open a bank account. She also encouraged Lam to take up useful courses. As Lam was attending a beauty course, she asked Lam to braid and decorate her hair and give her beauty tips. Lam even took a photograph of her on 29 October 2017 (Exhibit D3).[^19]

31     One day, the accused questioned Suresh over his will and asked him “how he can write like this.” Suresh did not like her questioning him and tore up his will. He threw it onto the floor and stormed off. The accused wanted evidence to show her children “how foolishly he has written”. Lam and she then taped the pieces together. Lam commented that men are always very rude and that they are never good to girls.[^20]

32     The accused was happy with Lam’s work. When her friends visited just before Diwali, they commented that her flat was “so neat like a museum”. She then called Lam over to receive the praise of her friends. The children however, complained that Lam stole their things, such as specially bought food and beauty products. The accused testified that she threatened to send Lam back to the agent on a couple of occasions, as Lam was stealing and lying but did not understand the seriousness. She felt that it was, “So embarrassing to even accuse somebody of stealing.”[^21]

## Evaluation of evidence

### General principles

33     The prosecution’s burden is to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In _Public Prosecution v GCK_ and another matter <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 2</span>, Sundaresh Menon, CJ (delivering the judgment of the court) stated at \[1\]:-

> There is but one true evidentiary standard in criminal law – proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This sacrosanct principle is easy to express, but defies simple definition. Difficulties often arise where the sole basis for a conviction is the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness.

34     The court held that where uncorroborated evidence forms the sole basis of conviction, the “unusually convincing” standard should be applied in assessing the evidence of the witness.[^22] In explaining the meaning of “unusually convincing” the Court stated at \[88\]-\[89\]:-

> 88.    The “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[38\]. In _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\], this court considered that “a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’” (citing _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\]). The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’s demeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the witness’s evidence.

> 89.    In our judgment, the “unusually convincing” standard is _necessarily_ applicable to the evidence of an eyewitness, just as it would apply to that of a complainant or an alleged victim, as long as the testimony of the witness in question is _uncorroborated_ and therefore forms the _sole_ basis for a conviction. This is because the basis for the “unusually convincing” standard has nothing to do with the _status_ of the witness concerned (namely, whether he or she is an alleged victim or an eyewitness), and instead has everything to do with “the ultimate rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt”: see _XP_ at \[31\]. In the absence of any other corroborative evidence, the testimony of a witness, whether an eyewitness or an alleged victim, becomes the keystone upon which the Prosecution’s entire case will rest. Such evidence can sustain a conviction only if it is “unusually convincing” and thereby capable of overcoming any concerns arising from the lack of corroboration and the fact that such evidence will typically be controverted by that of the accused person: see the decision of this court in _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> (“_AOF_”) at \[111\].

35     In the present case, the prosecution relied on the testimony of a single witness i.e. Lam. Having considered Lam’s testimony in totality, I did not find her evidence to be unusually convincing for the reasons which I will state below. It would have been unsafe to convict the accused on Lam’s uncorroborated testimony alone. In other words, for a conviction to be safely sustained, it was necessary for Lam’s testimony to be corroborated.

### Lam’s evidence was not unusually convincing

36     Apart from her claim that the accused had repeatedly beaten her, Lam made several other allegations. Objectively, some of these claims were true. For example, it was not in dispute that Lam was made to work at two places, which was in breach of the terms of her work permit. The accused had also retained Lam’s passport and work permit. However, Lam also alleged that she was not given food, and that she was starving and malnourished. She further claimed that the accused had locked her inside the Pebble Bay unit. I had concerns about the reliability of these claims.

#### Claim that Lam was not given food

37     Lam testified that the accused bought her a packet of rice with curry, vegetables and meat on her first day of work. Thereafter, she was not given food for the next two weeks. She spoke to Suresh about this, after which the accused bought her a pack containing five packets of instant noodles and a packet of food with some meat in it. She was told that the instant noodles would have to last her five weeks. On one occasion, Suresh bought her a pack of five packets of instant noodles and put it outside her room. She bought biscuits, instant noodles and 3-in-1 coffee with her own money on her day off.[^23]

38     Lam stated that she did not eat breakfast or lunch. Her first meal was at 3.00 to 4.00 p.m.. She used cold water to make her instant noodles. She did not have hot water as the accused hid the kettle. When she had coffee, she just poured the coffee powder into her mouth and drank water. Once every two weeks, the accused gave her roti prata. As at 7 December 2017, Lam thought that she was malnourished as she was not eating properly.[^24]

39     The accused claimed that Lam could eat or drink anything the family had. However, in contradiction to this, she also testified that on one occasion, she questioned and reprimanded Lam for stealing a lemon when she found lemon skin in the trash.[^25] A lemon would be a relatively low priced item, and it was incomprehensible that the accused would kick up such a fuss just because Lam took a lemon. Her assertion that Lam could eat or drink anything the family had was thus equivocal.

40     Whatever the case, the medical evidence suggested that Lam was not malnourished as she claimed. The medical records did not show that Lam was underweight or malnourished. When Dr Edgar was shown a photograph of Lam (Exhibit P23) which was taken on 12 December 2017, he did not think that Lam was malnourished. As documented in the clinical notes, Lam had declined the offer of biscuits and milo on 12 December 2017. Dr Edgar agreed in cross-examination that if Lam had not been given proper food for the last five months, she would not have turned down the offer of food.[^26] All these called into question Lam’s claim that she was malnourished due to the lack of food.

41     Lam further claimed that the accused hid the kettle to prevent her from using it. However, one of the photographs (Exhibit P4.5) which the police took on 13 December 2017, showed a kettle on the countertop of the kitchen. It also showed that the doors of the kitchen cabinets did not have any locks. It was therefore difficult to see how or where the accused could have hidden the kettle. Further, as Suresh testified, the kitchen also had a hot water supply and a microwave oven.[^27] Lam’s claim that she was deprived of the use of hot water was therefore disputable.

#### Claim that Lam was locked up

42     Lam claimed that she was locked up inside the Pebble Bay unit. She testified, “There were times I were left in the house with no food and no -- no keys.” She claimed that she could not leave the unit as she did not have the access card which was needed to open the door. To use the lift, she had to tap the access card on a card reader. She did not know if she could leave the unit without an access card as she never tried to do so.[^28]

43     The uncontroverted evidence of the accused, Suresh and Niveditha was that a spare access card was always available, and that a key to the front door was placed at the shoe rack outside the unit. This would have allowed Lam to leave and enter the Pebble Bay unit easily. It did not appear that Lam had any issue in leaving and entering the unit when she went to wash the two cars, or when she left and returned on her day off, even when the accused and Suresh were away. On 12 December 2017, Lam had no difficulty in leaving the Pebble Bay unit. She testified, “I can go out the back door from my room.”[^29] Her claim that she had been confined was thus suspect.

### The need for corroboration

44     It appeared that Lam was capable of embellishing her evidence when she claimed that she was starved and confined. Since these issues did not form the subject matter of the charges, there was no need for a definitive finding to be made on these peripheral issues or on others.

45     Even if Lam had embellished her evidence, this did not mean that her evidence should be rejected entirely. The court had to scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspects of her evidence may be accepted as true and which may be disregarded. As the then Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated in _Osman bin Ramli v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 203</span> at \[32\]:-

> 32    Thirdly, even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it does not automatically lead to a total rejection of his evidence. The court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded: _PP v Somwang Phatthanasaeng_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 414</span> at \[43\]; _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_ (\[31\] _supra_ at \[24\]); and _Loganatha Venkatesan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 904</span> at \[56\].

46     Further, since Lam’s evidence was not unusually convincing, it was incumbent on the prosecution to show that there was credible corroborative evidence to support her claims.

47     The prosecution had introduced various strands of evidence which were not related to the four charges. I placed no weight on these. For example, it tendered a series of photographs (Exhibit P38) taken by Lam on 27 September 2017 and 30 November 2017, which purportedly showed injuries the accused inflicted on her. Exhibit P38 did not corroborate Lam’s evidence as it did not relate to any of the charges. Similarly, I disregarded Ei Thandar’s evidence that she saw a lump the size of a potato on Lam’s head which Lam claimed was caused by the accused. This injury was not relevant in establishing whether the accused was guilty of the offences.

### The first charge

48     For the first charge, it was alleged that on or about 30 June 2017, the accused slapped Lam on her face, causing her bodily pain. This was Lam’s third day of work. The accused denied slapping Lam. To her, it was just a regular day and she could not specifically recall what happened.[^30]

#### Lam’s evidence on the first charge

49     Lam testified that on her third day of work, she was cleaning the living room in the afternoon. The accused did not like the way she cleaned and scolded her. When Lam replied, she made the mistake of using the word “mah” which she had picked up from her previous employment. The accused suddenly slapped her as she did not like Lam to use the word “mah”. Lam was shocked as she had never been slapped in that way, not even by her parents. From that day, the accused would hit her two to three times a day.[^31]

#### Lam’s evidence on the first charge was not corroborated

50     Lam’s allegation that the accused slapped her was not corroborated by any evidence. She did not take photographs of her alleged injuries, nor did she seek medical treatment. She did not even inform anyone that the accused had slapped her. Instead, the first time she raised this issue was in her police report of 12 December 2017.

51     As corroboration, the prosecution sought to rely on the accused’s statement to the police (Exhibit P42), where she admitted that she did not like Lam to use the word “mah”. She found Lam’s use of the word “mah” to be rude and thought that it was not the right way for Lam to speak to her. She also did not like Lam’s accompanying body language.[^32] However, the accused also specifically denied hitting Lam when she used the word “mah”. It could not be inferred from her admission that she would have inevitably slapped Lam. Her admission did not therefore serve as corroborative evidence.

#### Conviction on the first charge based solely on Lam’s uncorroborated evidence would be unsafe

52     As I have stated, it would have been unsafe to convict the accused based on Lam’s uncorroborated testimony alone. Due to the lack of corroborative evidence, I was not satisfied that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving the first charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was accordingly acquitted and discharged.

### The second charge

53     For the second charge, it was alleged that sometime in October 2017 at about 10.30 p.m., the accused hit Lam on her back with a black frying pan (Exhibit P5), causing Lam bodily pain. This was referred to as the “frying pan incident”. The accused denied assaulting Lam.

#### Lam’s evidence on the second charge

54     Lam testified that about three months after she started work, she was at the kitchen sink at around 10.30 p.m.. The accused scolded her for not cleaning the kitchen properly and for not being able to cook Indian dishes. She mistakenly told the accused, “I’m hungry, mah.” The accused became very angry and hit her on the back with a frying pan, which broke and fell to the floor. It was very painful, and Lam shivered. When she turned around to look at the accused, the accused threw the handle of the frying pan at her. The handle hit her arm and dropped to the floor. Lam then went to her room to cry and sent a message to Ei Thandar. Before doing so, she picked up the handle, washed it and put it on the kitchen top. She did not remember seeing the handle again.[^33]

#### The account of the defence on the broken frying pan

55     The accused testified that around the first week of December 2017, just before she travelled to India, the handle separated from the frying pan when she tried to use it. When she asked Lam about it, Lam said that Niveditha could have broken it. Lam assisted the accused to glue the handle to the pan with superglue. However, when the accused tried to use it half an hour later, the glue melted, and the pan came off the handle again. She then retained the pan but threw the handle away.[^34]

56     Niveditha testified that she broke the frying pan the week before 13 December 2017. As she did not put the pan onto the stove properly, it fell to the floor and broke. She testified that she had broken the pan in a similar way in October 2017 when the accused was travelling. She then put the pan and the handle separately back into the cupboard. She found out later that the pan had been repaired, but did not know who fixed it. She continued to use it between October and December 2017.[^35]

#### The photograph Exhibit P35.1 did not corroborate Lam’s allegations

57     The sole piece of corroborative evidence which the prosecution relied on for the second charge was the photograph Exhibit P35.1. This showed that Lam had an injury to her shoulder. However, it was doubtful that Exhibit P35.1 corroborated Lam’s evidence. When the prosecution adduced evidence on the second charge, Lam’s attention was not drawn to Exhibit P35.1. It was only when the prosecution adduced evidence in relation to the third charge that Lam claimed for the first time, that Exhibit P35.1 showed the injuries caused during the frying pan incident.

58     Lam also claimed that the frying pan incident occurred the night before she took Exhibit P35.1. As Exhibit P35.1 was taken on 27 October 2017, her evidence implied that the frying pan incident occurred in the evening of 26 October 2017. If this were so, it was most surprising that this date was not stipulated in the second charge from the very start. Further, when the prosecution amended the second charge at the close of its case, it continued to omit the precise date of the frying pan incident. Clearly, this showed a lack of conviction as regards Lam’s evidence.

59     It was therefore quite surprising that the prosecution sought to rely on Exhibit P35.1 as corroborative evidence in its closing submissions. The assertion (at \[64\]) that Lam’s account was corroborated by Exhibit P35.1 was disingenuous and opportunistic. It was never the prosecution’s case that Exhibit P35.1 showed the injuries caused during the frying pan incident. I therefore found that Exhibit P35.1 did not serve as corroborative evidence. Rather, Lam’s fresh claim in court on Exhibit P35.1 was materially inconsistent with the prosecution’s case.

#### Lam failed to state in her police statements that the accused threw the handle of the frying pan at her

60     The defence pointed out that while Lam testified that the accused also threw the handle of the frying pan at her, she failed to mention this in her statements to the police. In my view, this amounted to a material omission on Lam’s part, since the claims that the accused hit her with the frying pan and thereafter threw the handle at her were inextricably linked. This affected the veracity of her evidence on the second charge, and I could not find her evidence on this charge to be unusually convincing.

#### Inconsistencies in the defence case on the frying pan were not material

61     The prosecution highlighted various inconsistencies in the defence case. These related to how many times, when and how the handle of the frying pan broke.[^36] It was put to Lam that Niveditha broke the handle “a week prior to the 12th or 13th of December 2017”.[^37] The evidence of the accused and Niveditha was inconsistent with the case which was originally put.

62     The accused initially testified that the pan broke in December 2017, just before her trip. However, in cross-examination, she changed her story and claimed that the pan first broke in October 2017 when she was travelling. She also stated that when she tried to use it in November 2017, the handle came off the pan again. She then “threw the handle and retained the pan for future use”.[^38] By this account, it would have been impossible for Niveditha to have broken the handle in December 2017, since the accused threw the handle away in November 2017.

63     In her exchange of messages with Suresh on 13 December 2017 (Exhibit D6), Niveditha informed him that she broke the frying pan “last week” when she “wanted to cook chicken”. This implied that she first broke the frying pan in December 2017. In her statement to the police recorded on 3 February 2018 (Exhibit P50) she stated that the pan also broke when the accused was overseas. In court, Niveditha also claimed that she broke the frying pan twice.

64     While the accused and Niveditha were inconsistent in their evidence, this was ultimately not material. It was not the prosecution’s case that any lies told by the accused could corroborate Lam’s evidence.[^39] The inconsistencies could not therefore shore up any defects in the prosecution’s case or serve to corroborate Lam’s claim that the accused hit her with a frying pan.

#### Conviction on the second charge based solely on Lam’s uncorroborated evidence would be unsafe

65     In my assessment, a conviction on the second charge could not be sustained due to the lack of corroboration. I was not persuaded that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving the second charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was therefore acquitted and discharged.

### The third charge

66     For the third charge, it was alleged that the accused hit Lam on her shoulder area sometime on 27 October 2017, causing her bodily pain. The accused denied doing this. She stated that 27 October 2017 was like any other normal day and she could not remember what happened.[^40]

#### Lam’s evidence on the third charge

67     Lam testified that the accused hit her on her shoulder with her hand, leaving “fingerprints” on her shoulder. The trigger for the beating was Lam’s use of the word “mah” when she spoke to the accused. Lam took four photographs and two videos of her injured shoulder (Exhibit P35) at around 11.00 a.m., shortly after the accused hit her. After she took the photographs and videos, she sent them to Ei Thandar via Viber on the same day.[^41]

#### Lam’s account was corroborated by photographic evidence

68     Exhibits P35.2 to P35.4 as well as the two videos corroborated Lam’s claim that the accused assaulted her on 27 October 2017. She claimed that she took the photographs and videos (“the photographic evidence”) with her camera phone about 20 minutes after the assault to show the injuries inflicted on her. There was no reason to doubt that she did so.

69     The embedded data in the photographic evidence established that the photographs and videos were taken on 27 October 2017 between 11.03 and 11.21 a.m. (collectively “the timestamps”). There was undoubtedly a delay in producing the photographic evidence to the police. Lam only did so about three months after she lodged the first information report. However, in the overall context, this delay was not material since the defence did not challenge the authenticity of the photographic evidence or the timestamps.

70     On the evidence presented, no doubts were cast on the veracity of the photographic evidence or the timestamps embedded therein. There was no evidence to suggest that the images were altered or that the timestamps did not accurately reflect the date and times the photographs and videos were taken.

#### Lam was the person shown in the photographic evidence

71     The prosecution’s case was that while the photographic evidence did not show Lam’s face, she could be identified by the mole on her shoulder. The accused claimed, “That’s --- that’s a very vague coincidence that she \[Lam\] also has a mole and this photo also has a mole…”. The defence thus contended that since the person’s face was not captured, the images could possibly be of anybody and not necessarily of Lam.[^42]

72     I accepted Lam’s testimony that she was the person shown in the photographic evidence. While her face could not be seen, there was no doubt that she was the person shown therein. She could be identified by the mole on her shoulder, which is a distinctive feature. She even offered or attempted to show her mole when she testified.

#### The photographic evidence showed that Lam suffered injuries

73     Lam claimed that the photographic evidence showed the injuries caused by the accused. At first, the defence disputed that injuries were shown. Instead, it was put to Lam that the photographic evidence only showed discolouration, pigmentation or skin rash.[^43] It was surprising that the prosecution did not call any witnesses to support Lam’s claim. Without medical evidence, it may have been difficult to determine what was depicted.

74     Lam’s position was affirmed by the defence expert Dr Chan Kwai Onn (“Dr Chan”) (DW4), who reviewed the photographic evidence. In his report dated 2 April 2020 (Exhibit D21), Dr Chan stated that the images showed bruising over the top of the shoulder, extending slightly to the back, with a clear strip of unbruised skin in the middle. In his opinion, these bruises were likely to have been caused by blunt force trauma to the skin.[^44]

75     Dr Chan’s testimony was uncontroverted. It served to corroborate Lam’s claim that she suffered the injuries shown in the photographic evidence. Thus, by about 11.00 a.m. on 27 October 2017, Lam had sustained bruising on her shoulder in the manner described by Dr Chan. The live issue was how the injuries were caused.

#### Lam’s account of how the injuries were caused was credible and corroborated by the photographic evidence

76     Lam’s testimony that the accused assaulted her was credible and was not shaken in cross-examination. It was corroborated by objective photographic evidence which showed the extent of her injuries. Her claim that she took the photographic evidence to show the injuries inflicted was cogent and credible.

77     Lam had prior to that complained to Ei Thandar that the accused had assaulted her. Ei Thandar advised her to take photographs of her injuries if she was assaulted again. In taking the photographs and videos of her injuries, Lam was merely following the advice. I accepted that Lam sent P35.3 and a video to Ei Thandar to prove the assault occurred, since Ei Thandar was able to forward these to Thu Zar, Amey and Rebecca on 11 December 2017.

#### No conflict between Lam’s evidence and her statement to the police (Exhibit D23)

78     The defence asserted that Lam’s account of the assault was inconsistent. Her evidence in court was to the effect that the assault occurred about 20 minutes before 11.00 a.m., whereas she stated in her police statement (Exhibit D23) that the assault occurred at night.

79     I did not think that any conflict existed between Lam’s testimony and Exhibit D23. Lam explained that the accused had assaulted her twice that day, once in the morning, and once at night.[^45] Whether there was a separate assault at night was not in issue. The sole issue was whether the accused assaulted Lam in the morning. The timestamps objectively showed that Lam suffered injuries by around 11.00 a.m. on 27 October 2017. Since the photographic evidence showed that she was already injured in the morning, whatever may or may not have occurred that night was not material.

#### Various claims by the defence were devoid of merit

80     In challenging Lam’s evidence, the defence made several unsubstantiated claims. The accused first claimed that the photographic evidence did not show bruises but only pigmentation, rashes or insect bites.[^46] This claim was roundly discredited by its own expert witness Dr Chan, who said that these were bruises. The defence then claimed that the injuries could have been self-inflicted or accidentally caused, which were matters that were not even put to Lam. The claims by the defence were pure conjecture and devoid of any factual basis and did not serve to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s case.

81     By the accused’s account, things between Lam and her were generally fine at that time. There would therefore be no conceivable reason for Lam to self-inflict the injuries and then take photographs and videos of them. There would also be no reason to fail to inform the accused if she had accidentally hurt herself. It would be illogical to think that she took the photographic evidence to frame the accused. If she truly wanted to do so, it would be far more logical to produce the photographic evidence at the time the police report was made.

82     Lam’s account of why she took the photographs and videos was far more cogent and logical i.e. to capture images of the injuries the accused inflicted on her. I found that in all likelihood, it was the accused who caused the bruises shown in the photographic evidence.

### The fourth charge

83     For the fourth charge, it was alleged that on 7 December 2017 at about 5.45 a.m., the accused slapped Lam on the left side of her face causing her sensorineural hearing loss to the left ear due to labyrinthine concussion. The prosecution submitted that Lam’s claim that she was assaulted was corroborated by medical evidence which showed she suffered a hearing loss. The accused denied assaulting Lam.

#### Lam’s evidence on the fourth charge

84     Lam testified that on 7 December 2017, she was supposed to wake Narendran up at 5.45 a.m.. Although it was not yet time, the accused scolded her for not waking him up. The accused was in the kitchen while Lam was in the toilet. The accused asked Lam to “come out”. When Lam went to the kitchen, the accused slapped her three times on her left and right ears: once on the right side and twice on the left side. As a result, Lam could not hear properly. It was very painful, and her head ached. She also suffered from ringing in her ears, which she described as “woo, yii”.[^47]

85     Lam claimed that before that day, her hearing was perfect. However, after she was beaten by the accused, she could not hear anything the whole day. She also had a headache and felt dizzy and nauseous. Prior to that she did not experience any giddiness.[^48]

#### The accused’s evidence on the fourth charge

86     The accused left for India on 7 December 2017. Her flight was at 8.20 a.m.. She testified that she woke up at about 4.30 to 5.00 a.m. as she needed to do some last-minute packing. When she was ready, she called for an Uber taxi (“Uber”) to take her to the airport. Lam was awake and was going about her own routine. Once she got an Uber, she rushed to give Lam $50.00 and told her to manage with that money. She gave Lam some general instructions and then left with her considerable amount of luggage. At that time Narendran was in his room getting ready to go to camp. She denied hitting Lam.[^49]

#### Lam’s account was credible

87     In my view, Lam presented a credible account of what occurred. I accept that part of her duties was to wake Narendran up, that the accused was angry with her for not doing so, and that this led to the assault. I found the accused to be untruthful about what had occurred that morning. In particular, she sought to tailor her evidence as to the time she left for the airport.

#### Accused’s claim that it was not Lam’s duty to wake Narendran up was contradicted by Niveditha

88     Lam testified that the accused slapped her as she did not wake Narendran up. In her defence, the accused denied that this was part of Lam’s duties. She was adamant that Narendran would wake up on his own by using his mobile phone. However, the accused conceded that on the rare occasion, Lam would knock on his door if he did not wake up.[^50]

89     The defence failed to call Narendran to testify on this or what transpired that morning. However, the accused’s evidence was contradicted by Niveditha who testified that Lam would wake Narendran up in the morning, although she did not know if Lam did this every day as she was not at home.[^51]

#### The accused was untruthful when she claimed she left the Pebble Bay unit by about 5.35 a.m.

90     The accused initially testified that she left the Pebble Bay unit between 5.30 to 6.00 a.m. to catch her Uber. Based on the Uber receipt (Exhibit D18), the Uber arrived at about 5.47 a.m. and dropped the accused at the airport at 6.08 a.m.. Having seen Exhibit D18, the accused then claimed that she left the unit at about 5.25 to 5.35 a.m. as she had a lot of luggage. She wanted to wait for the taxi as she had previously been penalised in the amount of five dollars when she made the taxi wait.[^52]

91     The accused’s position was that she could not have slapped Lam at 5.45 a.m. (the time stated in the charge), since she had already left the Pebble Bay unit.[^53] She would have already “boarded the car” and was not at home when the offence was alleged to have been committed.[^54] In my view, the accused was untruthful and had tailored her evidence as to when she left the unit. It was put to Lam that the accused left at around 6.45 to 7.00 a.m.. The accused’s evidence was initially consistent with this. It was only after she saw the Uber receipt that she changed her evidence and claimed that she left the unit by about 5.35 a.m.. Her demeanour was poor throughout, and the notes of evidence record the fact that the accused laughed on many occasions when being cross-examined.

#### Lam’s claim that she was assaulted was corroborated by medical evidence

92     Lam’s claim that the accused assaulted her at the left side of her face and caused her to lose her hearing was corroborated by medical evidence. It was not in dispute that prior to this, Lam did not have any hearing issues.

93     When Lam was sent to CGH on 12 December 2017, Dr Edgar performed a Weber’s hearing test on her. This test involved placing a vibrating tuning fork on Lam’s forehead and asking her if she could hear better with her right or left ear or equally with both ears.[^55] He found that Lam had minimal hearing in the left ear. While this test was subjective and fairly rudimentary, there was nothing to suggest Dr Edgar’s conclusion was incorrect, since the first and second audiograms also yielded a similar result.

#### The first audiogram on 3 January 2018 showed Lam suffered a hearing loss

94     The first audiogram to test Lam’s hearing was performed on 3 January 2018. Dr Lee explained that the pure tone audiogram is a subjective test to assess the patient’s ability to hear. The patient would be placed in a soundproof room and asked to wear headphones. Sounds at different frequencies and loudness would then be introduced through the headphones, with one ear being tested at a time. If the patient heard a sound, he would press on a clicker. The results would then be plotted on a graph to determine if the patient had any hearing loss, and if so at what frequencies.[^56]

95     On 3 January 2018, Lam was tested by Joyce Lim (“Ms Lim”) (PW3) a trained audiologist who had worked in the field of audiology since 1976. I have no doubt that Ms Lim administered the test on Lam properly. Lam’s test result (Exhibit P12) showed that she had a high frequency hearing loss of mild to moderate severity. Dr Lee concluded that Lam had a left sensorineural hearing loss of mild to moderate severity.[^57]

96     Dr Chan, the expert who was called by the defence, agreed that the result of the first audiogram showed left sensorineural hearing loss.[^58] His main criticism was that audiograms are subjective hearing tests. This required the patient to be co-operative with the testing, failing which the test result could be misleading.[^59]

97     Dr Lee testified that there was no reason to suspect that Lam was malingering or that the test result was not accurate. If a patient was unreliable in testing, the audio technician would be able to pick this up and alert him of this. If, for example, the patient was clicking inconsistently as to whether he could hear a sound, the audio technician would highlight this. In Lam’s case, Dr Lee was not alerted to any unreliability on the first audiogram. Further, during consultation, he would also assess the patient to determine if the test result was consistent with his observation of the patient. Dr Lee found the thresholds in Lam’s test to be quite consistent and did not pick up any impossible findings.[^60]

98     In these circumstances, there was no reason to doubt that as at 3 January 2018, Lam had suffered a hearing loss in her left ear. This was consistent with the test Dr Edgar performed on her, and corroborated her claim that she suffered a hearing loss in her left ear as a result of the accused’s assault.

#### The second audiogram on 11 January 2018 showed that Lam’s hearing had improved

99     The second audiogram was performed on 11 January 2018 by Sabrina Tan (“Ms Tan”) (PW3) who had been working as an audiometric technician since 2003. I had no doubt that she conducted the test properly. Lam informed Dr Lee that she felt that her hearing was better. Dr Lee noticed that her hearing had improved but was not perfect. He wanted to monitor her to ensure a full recovery by repeating an audiogram in a month’s time.[^61] However, Lam defaulted on her appointment. In my view, as Lam’s hearing had improved, this was consistent with that of a patient who was recovering from a hearing loss.

#### Results of the third audiogram on 18 July 2018 and Auditory Brainstem Reflux test on 5 September 2018 were not relevant

100    The defence attempted to cast doubt on the results of the first and second audiograms on the basis that Lam was inconsistent in her responses in a third audiogram done on 18 July 2018 (“the third audiogram”). The third audiogram was about six months after the first and second audiograms. In my view, the result had no impact in determining the veracity of the first and second audiograms.

101    When Dr Lee saw Lam on 18 July 2018, she complained of left mastoid, left neck and left occipital pain. She also complained about vertigo for the first time. Clinical examination showed that everything was normal, except for tenderness when the left mastoid area was palpitated.

102    Lam claimed that her hearing was normal. However, the third audiogram indicated that she had a moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss. As the result was found to be unreliable and inconsistent, a further appointment was fixed for her to do an Auditory Brainstem Reflux test (“ABR”), which is an objective hearing test. Dr Chan, the defence expert, provided a clear explanation of how an ABR would be performed. He explained that the ABR is a test which measures brain activity once a sound is played to the patient’s ear. From reading the brain activity, it would objectively show whether the patient’s hearing was normal or abnormal.[^62] The ABR which was performed on Lam on 5 September 2018 showed a normal hearing threshold on both sides.[^63]

103    Although the result of the third audiogram was unreliable and inconsistent, it was highly unlikely that Lam was malingering or trying to create the impression that she had a hearing loss. Having told Dr Lee that her hearing was normal, it was unlikely that Lam would purposely post unreliable and inconsistent results during the audiogram. Dr Chan agreed that if patients wanted to malinger, “they would complain that they had a hearing loss”.[^64] Since Lam did not complain of any hearing loss, it was most unlikely that she had attempted to malinger during the third audiogram. The prosecution also pointed out that as Lam had tinnitus, this could have affected the result of the third audiogram.[^65]

104    Although the third audiogram was not reliable, I could not conclude that the results of the two earlier audiograms were also inaccurate. When Dr Chan testified that Lam could have exaggerated her symptoms, he was referring to the result of the third audiogram, the ABR as well as the clinical notes relating to these two tests.[^66] He was not referring to the results of the first and second audiograms. The three audiograms were done at different points of time and the result of each audiogram had to be considered on its own merits. Further, the defence could not specify how the ABR could negate the results of the first two audiograms.

105    The crucial question was whether there was any reason to think that the results of the first two audiograms were inaccurate. The personnel who conducted the audiograms were very experienced professionals who conducted the tests properly. Both Ms Lim and Ms Tan testified that when testing patients, they would only record a response if the patient gave at least two identical responses to a pure tone. They would also re-test certain points of the patient’s hearing. This was to ensure the reliability of the tests.[^67]

106    In my view, it was extremely unlikely that experienced professionals such as Ms Lim, Ms Tan or Dr Lee would be mistaken about the veracity of the first and second audiograms. Thus, I accepted that the results of the first and second audiograms were accurate, and that Lam had sustained a loss of hearing in her left ear. This supported her claim that she suffered a hearing loss when the accused hit her.

##### _Lam suffered a_ sensorineural hearing loss to the left ear due to labyrinthine concussion

107    The next issue was whether Lam’s sensorineural hearing loss was caused by labyrinthine concussion, as stated in the charge. Dr Lee explained that there are three types of hearing loss. The first is a sensorineural hearing loss due to a nerve problem. Secondly, there could be a conductive hearing loss due to issues with the bones in the inner ear or a hole in the eardrum. The third type of hearing loss is a combination of both types.[^68] In Dr Lee’s opinion, the hearing loss was sensorineural and that this was caused by a labyrinthine concussion. He testified that a labyrinthine concussion could be caused by a fall, an assault or a road traffic accident.

108    Dr Chan found it very surprising that Dr Lee testified that Lam had suffered labyrinthine concussion as the term did not appear in the clinical notes. This was easily explained. When giving evidence, Dr Lee wanted to be more specific on the cause of the sensorineural hearing loss. He thus added that it was his opinion that this was caused by labyrinthine concussion i.e. trauma to the labyrinth system.[^69]

109    Dr Chan stated that the “labyrinth” would refer to the inner ear. If a blunt impact or force was applied, the energy would cause a person to be stunned in the inner ear. Labyrinthine concussion would be a diagnosis of exclusion, which could be arrived at if no fractures were found via an MRI or CT scan. He did not think that Dr Chan’s diagnosis was accurate. In his opinion, a lower impact injury such as a slap on the ear was very unlikely to cause labyrinthine concussion. His view was that the force must be quite severe and the impact quite big for labyrinthine concussion to be caused. The patient would then suffer a hearing loss and be “very very dizzy for a long time”.[^70]

110    Although Dr Chan expressed doubts as to whether Lam had suffered labyrinthine concussion, Lam’s evidence was consistent with the symptoms described by him. Following the assault, Lam was dizzy and nauseous. She stated that she could not bend down to pick things up. When she did so, she could not stand up. She felt nauseous and “wanted” to fall down.[^71] Even when she was examined on 12 December 2017, Lam complained to Dr Edgar that she had giddiness. Many months later, at her routine domestic worker’s medical examination on 28 June 2018, she complained to Dr Koh Eng Hoe (PW11) of Assurance Medicare Clinic and Surgery that she felt giddy every day.[^72] Thereafter, arrangements were made for her to see Dr Lee again.

111    While Dr Chan contradicted Dr Lee’s opinion, he did not provide any alternative diagnosis as to the precise cause of Lam’s hearing loss. Having considered the evidence in totality, I accepted Dr Lee’s opinion that Lam had suffered labyrinthine concussion which caused her sensorineural hearing loss.

#### Inconsistency between Lam’s evidence and her statement to the police (Exhibit D9) was not material

112    The defence submitted that there was a material inconsistency between Lam’s evidence and her statement to the police which was recorded on 19 January 2018 (Exhibit D9). Lam testified that the accused hit her three times in her face i.e. once on the right side and twice on the left side. However, she stated in Exhibit D9 that the accused hit her once on her right shoulder, and that when she was holding her right shoulder, the accused slapped her once on the back of her ear.

113    Taking the evidence as a whole, I did not find the discrepancy to be material. Lam’s evidence that she was slapped on both ears was supported by Exhibit P33, where she informed Dr Edgar on 12 December 2017 that she was slapped on “both sides of the ear.” She also informed Dr Lee on 3 January 2018 that the accused slapped her on both ears. It was therefore unlikely that her claim in court that she was hit in both ears was fabricated. If anything, it appeared that her account in Exhibit D9 could have been inaccurate.

### Claim that Lam made false allegations as she was caught stealing had no merit

114    The defence contended that Lam ran off and fabricated false allegations against the accused because she was caught stealing nail polish. Niveditha testified that she found two bottles of her pink nail polish in Lam’s room on 9 December 2017 and took a photograph of them. On Sunday, 10 December 2017, she found a blue bottle of her nail polish in Lam’s room and took a photograph of it. She messaged Suresh to inform him that Lam had stolen her nail polish. She did not confront Lam as she had no authority to do so, but waited for Suresh to return from his business trip on 11 December 2017.[^73]

115    Suresh testified that he spoke to Lam and Niveditha a few minutes after he returned from his trip. At first Lam denied taking anything. She only admitted to taking the items when he showed her the photographs Niveditha sent him. He told Lam that it was not advisable for her to take petty things. He warned her of the seriousness of what she did, He also warned her that he could complain to the police if she continued to steal. Lam informed him that she wanted a transfer. In his view, “I’ve given her the warning, and then we will move on.” According to Suresh, it was a very polite conversation.[^74]

116    In my view, the suggestion that Lam ran away and concocted false allegations as she was afraid that she would be reported to the police or sent back to Myanmar had no merit. Long before she ran off, Lam had already complained to Ei Thandar that the accused was abusing her. Lam had even contemporaneously photographed the injuries she suffered on 27 October 2017. It was thus implausible that Lam’s allegations of abuse were fabricated as a response to being accused of stealing. Rather, Lam’s claim that she ran off as she had been abused by the accused was much more plausible. It was amply supported by medical evidence which showed that she suffered a hearing loss.

117    Even if she had stolen the nail polish, it did not make any sense for Lam to run away. By Suresh’s account, he had warned Lam not to steal. His message to her was that if she continued to do so, he would report her to the police. He considered the matter closed. There was therefore no danger that a police report would be made against Lam or that she would be sent home for what she had done, but only if she stole again. Moreover, by running away, it was quite certain that Suresh would have to make a report against her. There was thus no reason for Lam to run away or to concoct allegations against the accused.

### Lam’s delay in reporting should not be held against her

118    The defence submitted that Lam’s evidence was unbelievable since she delayed in seeking help and reporting the matter. It contended that Lam had many opportunities to report the alleged assaults. She had every Sunday off and could have lodged a police report. She could also have complained to the doctor when she went for her medical check-up at East Coast Family Clinic on 4 December 2017. The defence submitted that it was incredulous that Lam would wait five months to report the assaults, which she claimed occurred three times a day.[^75]

119    It was not accurate to say that Lam did not report the abuse. Lam had sought the help of Ei Thandar, a volunteer at CDE. The CDE is an organisation which assists domestic helpers with their problems, including maid abuse issues. The exchange of messages between Ei Thandar and Lam objectively showed that Ei Thandar had provided Lam with advice after Lam claimed that she was being abused. It was therefore not true that Lam made her first complaint only after she ran away on 12 December 2017.

120    The fact that Lam did not report the matter to the police or run away earlier should not count against her. It has been recognised that the failure of a domestic worker to attempt escape or seek help could equally indicate the extent of her vulnerability and fear. In _Ang Lilian v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 119</span> (_“Ang Lillian”_), See Kee Oon, J stated at \[41\]:-

> 41    I found the appellant’s contentions to be devoid of any merit. The fact that the victim had not attempted escape or sought help despite the abuse she allegedly suffered is neither here nor there. While an attempt to escape or seek help may be construed as conduct that can corroborate the existence of an abusive environment, a failure to attempt escape or to seek help could be equally indicative of the extent of the victim’s vulnerability and abject fear of her employer (to the extent that she does not dare to escape or seek help). In that regard, the difficulties which may be faced by domestic maids in reporting abuse were recognised by the Court of Appeal in _ADF_ (\[20\] _supra_) at \[61\]:

>> … \[m\]any domestic maids work within the confines of the employer’s home and have little contact with the rest of the society. Often, they are not well educated and cannot speak English or effectively communicate with the wider public. Further, not all cases of abuse come to light as some maids may be apprehensive about the consequences of seeking help in a foreign environment. Less educated maids may also not be aware of their rights and the severe view taken by the authorities here in relation to substantiated complaints. Lee Han Shih, ‘Silence on maid abuse must end’, Business Times (27 July 2002), observed:

>>> Many maids come from a background which carries with it a natural fear that the police are working for the rich, and are reluctant to seek their protection even when the opportunity presents itself …

> 42    In my judgment, even if the victim was aware of her legal rights, it must be recognised that the act of reporting an abusive employer would have required a degree of fortitude on the victim’s part. The victim should neither be faulted nor have her credibility undermined simply because her fear had prevented her from lodging a complaint or extricating herself from the appellant’s abuse.

121    To explain her delay in reporting the matter to the police and escaping the abuse, Lam offered several explanations. She did not make a report in the first few months as she had just started work and thought that there was a misunderstanding with the accused. She decided to try hard and hoped to get along with the accused. There were no witnesses and the accused always lied. She did not report the assaults to the agent as the agent told her not to contact them if there was any problem. She did not make a complaint to the doctor when she went for a medical check-up on 4 December 2017 as the accused was in the next room. The accused also told her that she could bribe the police and government officers and they would shut it up. Lam was further concerned that the case would be prolonged and that she would have to stay in Singapore without a job and money.[^76]

122    I was of the view that the explanation given by Lam was reasonable. As she had come to Singapore to work, it would be reasonable for her to want to work things out with her employer. It would also be reasonable for her to think that she would lose her job if she reported the accused and that she would have to remain in Singapore without a job. These were valid concerns and she had expressed them to Ei Thandar.[^77] Thus, I was not prepared to hold that Lam could be faulted or her credibility undermined just because she delayed reporting the matter to the police or did not run away earlier.

### Finding of guilt

123    For the reasons stated above, I found that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the offences stated in the third and fourth charges. No reasonable doubt existed in her favour. The accused was therefore found guilty and convicted of the third and fourth charges.

## Sentence

### Prescribed punishment

124    An offence under s 323 of the Penal Code is punishable with a term of imprisonment which may extend to 2 years or a fine which may extend to $5,000 or with both. By reason of s 73(2) thereof, the prescribed punishment would be enhanced to one and a half times when hurt is caused to a domestic maid.

### Antecedents

125    On 13 June 2008, the accused was convicted of an offence of theft punishable under s 379 of the Penal Code. She was sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000. This conviction was rendered spent on 2 August 2008. As this offence was not similar and as the conviction was rendered spent, no weight was placed on this antecedent in sentencing the accused.

### Consideration of sentence

#### General principles

126    In sentencing offenders for domestic maid abuse cases, the foremost need is for deterrence and retribution. In _ADF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGCA 57</span>, VK Rajah, JA stated at \[55\]:-

> 55.    In a case of domestic maid abuse, ordinarily, the principles of deterrence and retribution take precedence. A deterrent sentence signifies that there is a public interest to protect over and above the ordinary punishment of criminal behaviour. _The protection of domestic maids from abuse by their employers is always a matter of public interest, given their vulnerable status and the prevalence of such relationships in Singapore_. No employer or household member has the right to engage in abusive behaviour against a domestic maid. All maids should be treated fairly, with dignity and respect. Indeed, domestic maid abuse not only causes harm to the victim and calls for deep public indignation; it could also harm Singapore’s bilateral relations with other countries…

127    VK Rajah, JA further held at \[91\] that “… it was clear that a custodial sentence is almost invariably warranted in cases of domestic maid abuse where there has been any manner of physical abuse…”.

128    The prosecution submitted for a sentence of three months’ imprisonment for the third charge and for six months’ imprisonment for the fourth charge, with both sentences to run consecutively.[^78] The defence accepted that a custodial sentence should be imposed. It urged the court to sentence the accused to not more than three weeks’ imprisonment for the third charge and to not more than six weeks’ imprisonment for the fourth charge, with both sentences to run consecutively.[^79]

#### General aggravating factors

129    It was not in dispute that the accused made Lam work at both the Pebble Bay and the Makena units. This was in breach of the conditions of Lam’s work permit. Lam did not have any say in this matter. The accused did not even pay her any extra salary. There was therefore a degree of exploitation. Nor was it in dispute that when Lam ran away, she did not have her passport or work permit as the accused had retained it. This constituted oppressive conduct on the part of the accused, which was another aggravating factor.

130    The accused knew that she could not keep Lam’s work permit. She was adamant that Lam always had her work permit in her wallet.[^80] Her claim was objectively shown to be untrue. When confronted with Exhibit P40 (which was issued to her when she handed Lam’s passport and work permit to the police), she failed to provide a valid explanation as to why she retained Lam’s passport and work permit. She could only speculate that when Lam returned from her medical check-up on 4 December 2017, she may have put the work permit inside the passport when she handed her passport to the accused.[^81] This explanation was based on surmise and was totally unconvincing. In any event, the accused failed to provide any valid justification for retaining Lam’s passport.

#### Plea-in-mitigation

131    In the plea-in-mitigation, counsel informed the court that the accused had a Master of Commerce degree from the University of Madras. She had worked in various jobs over the years. She had renounced her Indian citizenship and taken on Singapore citizenship. She was involved in charitable work, including being a religious counsellor at the Changi Prison B3 Cluster from 2011 to 2014. She had co-operated with the authorities, had a lack of related antecedents, and had a low risk of re-offending.

#### Sentence for the third charge

132    With respect to the third charge, the harm caused was relatively low. However, the accused must have hit Lam quite hard, since she left visible marks on Lam’s shoulder, which were captured in Exhibit P35. The attack on Lam was gratuitous as the accused struck Lam just because Lam used the word “mah”. The accused displayed arrogance and testified that she felt “my English is very good”. She saw it fit to correct Lam when she used Singlish words like “mah” and “lah”.[^82] This showed a lack of tolerance on the part of the accused.

133    In favour of the defence, I found that the harm caused was pre-dominantly physical. There was no evidence to show that Lam suffered significant psychological harm. The sentencing framework in _Tay Wee Kiat & another v Public Prosecutor_ \[2018\] 4 SLR 42 (_“Tay Wee Kiat”_) which related to cases involving psychological harm, thus did not apply.

134    The sentencing precedents showed that stiff deterrent sentences of two to three months’ imprisonment would be meted out for maid abuse cases even when the injuries were not serious. In _Tay Wee Kiat_, the second appellant Chia (Tay’s wife) faced two charges, one for slapping the victim once in her face and another for punching the victim once on her forehead. She was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment per charge, which was upheld on appeal.

135    Even when the assault was less egregious, stiff sentences have been imposed for simple assaults. In _Public Prosecutor v Annie Loh Beem Hiang_ (MCN-902177-2018), the offender pleaded guilty to two charges of assaulting her domestic helper, with two charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. For the first proceeded charge, the offender hit the victim on her arm once with an open palm after the victim admitted to eating a slice of cheese. The offender was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for this charge.

136    In assessing sentence, I noted that there was a degree of exploitation and oppression on the accused’s part and that there were no mitigating factors. I was of the view that a sentence of two months’ imprisonment was the appropriate punishment.

#### Sentence for the fourth charge

137    In _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span>, the court classified a temporary or mild loss of a sensory function as moderate harm. For the fourth charge, Lam had a temporary loss of hearing which would fall under moderate harm. The accused had targeted Lam’s head, which is a vulnerable part. She would have hit Lam with considerable force, since Dr Chan testified that for a labyrinthine concussion to be caused, there needed to be a severe force and a big impact. These were further aggravating factors.

138    The sentencing precedents showed that for cases where domestic workers suffered a temporary loss of sensory function, sentences of around four and a half to five months’ imprisonment were imposed when the offenders pleaded guilty. For example, in _Public Prosecutor v Chan Yun Hui Jenny_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 64</span>, the offender pinched the victim’s ears with her fingernails, causing it to bleed. She also punched the victim’s eye multiple times until it was so swollen that the victim could not see with her left eye for 30 minutes. There were good mitigating factors in that case. The offender had shown remorse and had made voluntarily compensation. She also had a psychiatric condition which contributed to the offences.

139    Although the facts of the present case are less aggravated, there were no mitigating factors in favour of the accused. All considered, I sentenced the accused to five months’ imprisonment for the fourth charge.

#### Totality of sentence

140    As the offences were separate and distinct, I ordered the sentences to run consecutively. The total sentence is proportionate to offences committed and is just and reasonable.
