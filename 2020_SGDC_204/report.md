\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9778/2020/01.\]

4 September 2020

### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, 56 years old, pleaded guilty to three charges. He was convicted on:

> (a)      MAC 909818/2019 - for committing a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition, by failing to remain indoors at his place of residence for a cumulative period of 24 hours by breaching his curfew hours between 21 September 2019 at 10 pm and 24 September 2019 at 8.30 pm for a total of 58 hours 30 minutes, an offence punishable under section 50Y(1)(a), Prisons Act, Chapter 247, 2000 Rev Ed ((“Prisons Act”). He was liable to be punished with a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order (from 23 September 2019 to 28 January 2021), i.e. 494 days.

> (b)      DAC 902139/2020 - for failing to present himself for urine test at Bedok Police Division Headquarters as required under a supervision order, an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations, punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the said Regulations. At the material time, the Accused was also subject to a remission order and hence, he was liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order (from 23 September 2019 to 28 January 2021), i.e. 494 days.

> (c)      DAC 902140/2020 - for consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, diamorphine without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”) or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA. The Accused was liable to an enhanced penalty under section 33A(2) of the MDA; and was also subject to a remission order and hence, he was liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order (from 1 September 2019 to 28 January 2021), i.e. 516 days.

2       The Accused admitted to and consented to having three other charges under the MDA taken into consideration.

3       These sentences were imposed on the charges:

4       The Accused is dissatisfied with the sentence.

## Background Facts

5       Prior to the commission of these offences, on 26 August 2015, the Accused was convicted of three drug-related offences. These were offences for consumption of a specified drug and two counts of failing to report for urine test. He was sentenced to serve a term of five years and six months’ imprisonment.

6       Subsequently, the Accused was released from prison on 1 April 2019 and subjected to a remission order under s 50I of the Prisons Act, from 1 April 2019 to 28 January 2021 (both dates inclusive). The Accused was placed on the Mandatory After Scheme (“MAS”) and subjected to mandatory aftercare conditions (“MAS conditions”) under s 50V(3) of the Prisons Act. The current offences were committed whilst the Accused was subject to the remission order.

## Facts relating to MAC 909818/2019 (Offence under section 50Y(1)(a), Prisons Act)

7       One of the MAS conditions required the Accused to, amongst other things, reside in Selarang Halfway House and to remain indoors at the halfway house between 10 pm and 6 am every day of the week. The remission order also specified that a failure to remain indoors, when required to do so under the remission order or at the time and day specified by the halfway house for a cumulative period of 24 hours would constitute a serious breach of a MAS condition. The Accused had signed on the said remission order on 1 April 2019, acknowledging that the contents of the remission order had been fully explained to and understood by him.

8       On 21 September 2019, the Accused failed to return to the halfway house on expiry of his approved time-off at 10 pm. At about 10.41 pm, the staff from the halfway house called the Accused on his mobile phone, but the Accused did not answer. Text and Whatsapp messages were sent to the Accused but he did not respond. The Accused only responded at 4.35 pm on 22 September 2019, stating that he was having some problems, without elaborating further. On 22 September 2019 at about 5.02 pm, rescindment messages were sent to the Accused via text and WhatsApp messages, informing him that he had no more approved time-off from 11.59 pm on 22 September 2019 onwards.

9       As the Accused failed to remain indoors for a cumulative period of 24 hours, the complainant subsequently lodged a police report. On 24 September 2019 at about 8.30 pm, the Accused returned to the halfway house and was placed under arrest. The Accused had breached his curfew for a total of 58 hours and 30 minutes.

## Facts Relating to DAC 902139/2020 (Failure to report for urine test)

10     The Accused was placed under compulsory drug supervision from 1 April 2019 for a period 24 months. The Accused was required to present himself for a urine test at Bedok Police Division Headquarters every Monday and Thursday of each month, during the period of supervision, that is from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2021, from 9.30am to 10.00pm commencing on 4 April 2019. The Accused failed to present himself for urine test on 23 September 2019 at Bedok Police Division Headquarters without any valid reasons or medical certificates.

11     For breach of a basic condition of the remission order, the Accused was liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment of a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 494 Days (from 23 September 2019 to 28 January 2021) for that offence.

## Facts Relating to DAC 902140/2020 (Consumption of drug)

12     On 3 September 2019, after being arrested for drug-related offences whilst at the halfway house, at Bedok Police Divisional HQ, the Accused provided two bottles of his urine samples. The urine samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority for analysis. The HSA subsequently issued two certificates under s 16 of the MDA, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Monoacetylmorphine. Monoacetylmorphine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The presence of monoacetylmorphine in the urine was a result of the Accused’s consumption of diamorphine.The Accused admitted to consuming ‘panas’ (street name for diamorphine) since May 2019 while in the halfway house. The Accused last consumed ‘panas’ on 1 September 2019 before his arrest, in a public toilet around the vicinity of Bukit Merah Central.

13     Further, before the commission of the above offence, the Accused was on 26 August 2015 in District Court No. 3, vide DAC 928652/2015, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and punished under section 33A(1) of the said Act with 5 years’ imprisonment. Since the conviction and sentence had not been set aside to date, the Accused was liable to punishment under section 33A(2) of the MDA.

14     In addition, for breach of a basic condition of the remission order, the Accused was liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment of a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 516 days (from 1 September 2019 to 28 January 2021) for that offence.

## Mitigation

16     In a written mitigation, the Accused explained that the reason why he was absent from the halfway house was because he had to attend his mother’s death anniversary. He highlighted that he surrendered himself immediately after doing so. He pleaded for the sentences in the charges to run concurrently.

## Decision on Sentence

17     I do not think there can be any dissatisfaction with the main sentences imposed on the consumption of drug and failing to report for urine test charges.

18     I imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment for the consumption of drug offence (DAC 902140/2020). For the offence of failing to report for urine test (DAC 902139/2020), considering that this was the Accused’s fifth contravention of the supervision orders and fourth conviction, a term of eight months’ imprisonment on this current charge cannot be considered manifestly excessive. On his last conviction, the Accused was already sentenced to a term of six months’ imprisonment.

19     I now turn to the enhanced sentences imposed.

### Enhanced Sentences under section 50(T)(1)(a) of the Prisons Act

20     Section 50T(1)(a) of the Act provides as follows:

> (_1_)     _When a person commits an offence in breach of the basic condition of his remission order made under Division 2 or 3, the court may, in addition to imposing any sentence on the person for that offence, impose an enhanced sentence for that offence as follows:_

>> (_a_)     _Imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the commission of the offence._

21     Section 50T continues:

> (_3_)     _In deciding whether to impose any enhanced sentence under subsection (1) or (2) with respect to any offence, and if so the length of the enhanced sentence, the court shall consider —_

>> (_a_)     _the gravity of the offence;_

>> (_b_)     _whether the offence is of a similar nature to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced;_

>> (_c_)     _the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order; and_

>> (_d_)     _all other relevant circumstances._

#### Basic Principles

22     I began the consideration of the enhanced sentences for the breach of the basic condition of the remission order under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act in respect of the consumption and failing to report for urine test charges (referred to as “breaching offences”) with these starting basic principles. These principles were set out in the case of _PP v Mohamad Dom bin Matsaad_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 11</span> and later summarized in the case of _PP v Norfarah Binte Amir Hamzah_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 171</span>. At \[31\] of _Norfarah_, it was stated:

> (a)     The determination of the enhanced sentence is a distinct and separate sentencing exercise from the sentence to be passed for the (breaching) offence.

> (b)     There are two decisions to be made in the enhanced sentencing exercise – whether an enhanced sentence is warranted and the length of the enhanced sentence, if it is warranted.

> (c)     The enhanced sentence is not a “fresh” sentence in that the court is not called upon to generate a sentence from scratch. Instead, the court is tasked to decide how much of the remaining suspended sentence ought to be “clawed back” and served in prison.

> (d)     The factors for making the two decisions at (b) are stipulated in section 50T(3) of the Act. These are the gravity of the breaching offence, the similarity of the breaching offence to the remission offence(s) and how long the person had remained crime-free after release on remission. It is evident from these factors that the court has to be concerned with not only the breaching offence but also with the remission offences for which the person was placed on conditional remission.

> (e)     The enhanced sentence is to be imposed and calibrated with the objectives of the CRS \[Conditional Remission System\] in mind. As spelt out in section 50E(1) of the Act, the purposes of the remission of sentences are to encourage good conduct and industry by prisoners who are serving their sentences and to facilitate the rehabilitation of prisoners and their reintegration into society. Bearing in mind the objectives of the CRS, the imposition of the enhanced sentence must serve the purposes for which a person was placed on remission and it must safeguard the integrity and not undermine the effective functioning of the CRS.

23     I agree with the above principles.

24     In the case before me, I was satisfied that enhanced sentences under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act ought to be imposed in respect of both the breaching offences. The breaching offences were grave in nature and were identical to the charges for which the Accused had been placed on remission for.

#### Prosecution’s Sentencing Approach and Framework

25     In considering the appropriate enhanced sentence to be imposed under section 50T of the Prisons Act, I was in broad agreement with the Prosecution’s sentencing approach and framework

26     In their sentencing submissions, the Prosecution proposed a three-stage approach. In the first stage, the court is to consider the factors under section 50T(3)(a)-(c) of the Prisons Act. These are mainly offence-specific factors. Based on these factors, the court decides which sentencing band the case falls within, as well as the starting point within the band.

27     The second stage will be to calibrate the indicative starting point within the sentencing band. The Prosecution proposed the following framework:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="9.54%"> <col width="32.02%"> <col width="58.44%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Prosecution’s Sentencing Framework under section 50T of the Prisons Act</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing range (for claim trial cases)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Elaboration</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 day to 1/3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Based on the factors in the first stage, if the <em>overall severity of the case</em> may be considered “<em>low</em>”, the sentence may fall within this band.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Based on the above checklist, if the <em>overall severity of the case</em> may be considered “<em>moderate</em>”, the sentence may fall within this band.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to maximum</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Based on the above checklist, if the <em>overall severity of the case</em> may be considered “<em>high</em>”, the sentence may fall within this band.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

28     The third stage would be for the court to consider any relevant circumstances, including offender-specific factors.

29     Bearing in mind the basic principles as set out earlier and using the Prosecution’s sentencing approach and framework as a guide, I turned to consider the appropriate length of the enhanced sentence for each of the breaching offence.

#### Enhanced Sentence for breaching offence of failure to report for urine test (DAC 902139/2020)

30     Despite his arrest on 3September 2019 for drug-related activities and being placed on a supervision order, the Accused failed to present himself for a urine test mandated by the supervision order. The Accused’s failure to report for a urine test was committed on 23 September 2019, only about five months after he was released on the remission order. Moreover, the breaching offence was identical to the offence for which he was placed under the remission order.

31     I agreed with the Prosecution that the overall severity of the Accused’s case for this offence was “moderate” and would fall within Band 2 of the Prosecution’s framework. The indicative enhanced sentence would be between 165 days to 329 days’ imprisonment, the maximum number of days of imprisonment allowed under section 50T(1)(a) being 494 days.

32     Given the nature of the breaching offence where the intended imprisonment term for this Accused would be eight months’ imprisonment (and thus not extremely severe), I took the view that the appropriate enhanced sentence should be from low to middle range of Band 2 i.e. between 165 - 250 days’ imprisonment. I did not see a need to pin a specific number of days of imprisonment down at this stage.

33     I then turned to consider all other relevant circumstances. The most significant would be the Accused’s plea of guilt. Taking that into account, I accorded a 1/3 discount from the maximum number of days within the indicative range of sentence i.e. 250 days’ imprisonment, thus arriving at 166 days’ imprisonment as the enhanced sentence.

#### Enhanced Sentence for breaching offence of consumption of drug (DAC 902140/2020)

34     I took a similar approach in considering the enhanced sentence for the offence of drug consumption under DAC 902140/2020.

35     Shortly after being released on the remission order on 1 April 2019, the Accused returned to abusing drugs on 1 September 2019, where he consumed diamorphine. Once again, it had been barely five months since he was placed on the remission order for the exact same offence of consumption (and failing to report for urine test offences). Further, the current consumption offence was an extremely serious one which carried with it a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of seven years.

36     Agreeing with the Prosecution, I considered the severity of the Accused’s case for this offence to fall within the medium to high range of Band 3 of the Prosecution’s framework. The indicative range of enhanced sentence would be 430 to 516 days’ imprisonment, the maximum number of days of imprisonment allowed under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act being 516 days. However, I did not consider the Accused’s case to be the worst and deserving of the maximum number of 516 days’ imprisonment. An indicative sentence would be closer to 480 days’ imprisonment, about mid-point of the range.

37     Considering the Accused’s plea of guilt, I accorded a 1/3 discount from 480 days imprisonment, thus arriving at 320 days’ imprisonment as the enhanced sentence.

### Sentence under section 50(Y)(1)(a) Of the Prisons Act for Breach of Mandatory Aftercare Condition (MAC 909818/2019)

38     The relevant sections read:

> **_50Y._**—(1)     _A person who commits a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of his remission order shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to —_

>> (_a_)     _imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the offence;_

>> _……_

> (_2_)     _In deciding the punishment to be imposed for an offence under subsection (1), the court shall consider —_

>> (_a_)     _the gravity of the serious breach;_

>> (_b_)     _the length of time for which the person did not commit any breach of a mandatory aftercare condition after being released under the remission order;_

>> (_c_)     _whether the serious breach evidences a lack of commitment by the person to his rehabilitation and reintegration into society; and_

>> (_d_)     _all other relevant circumstances._

39     As stated in the case of _Norfarah_, one of the first things to bear in mind for the calibration of the sentence under section 50Y(1)(a) of the Prisons Act for an offence of a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition is that this is a distinct offence and not an “add-on” to the punishment for a breaching offence[^1], unlike that in section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act. However, the court is not called upon to generate a “fresh” sentence. Instead, the court is limited by the remaining period of the suspended sentence of the remission offence in the punishment it can mete out as a sentence under section 50Y(1)(a) of the Act[^2]. In this case, the Accused was liable to be punished with a sentence not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 494 days’ imprisonment.

#### Accused’s culpability

40     I agreed with the Prosecution that the factors in section 50Y(a)-(c) of the Prisons Act were essentially factors which go towards a consideration of the Accused’s culpability. I did not see the need to dissect the factors as Prosecution proposed in paragraph 8 of their sentencing skeletal submissions, preferring to approach it in a similar way as was done for section 50T.

41     In this case, the Accused committed a serious breach of his mandatory aftercare condition when he breached his curfew hours for 58 hours and 30 minutes. The breach was committed within six months of his release under the remission order. Considering that the Accused’s remission order was for a period of about 21 months (from 1 April 2019 to 28 Jan 2021), this breach was committed fairly early in the remission period. Having said that, the duration for which the Accused was absent from the halfway house was short and he did not commit any offences in the course of the breach. In respect of the motivation behind the breach of his curfew hours, it did not appear to be sinister; the Accused explained he had to attend his mother’s death anniversary. This was not disputed by the Prosecution.

42     Similar to the Prosecution, I assessed the Accused’s overall culpability in respect of this offence to be moderate. Using the Prosecution’s sentencing bands which they set out in paragraph 10 of their sentencing skeletal submissions, the framework, with slight modification, may be reflected as follows:-

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.18%"> <col width="40.34%"> <col width="39.48%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing Framework under section 50Y of the Prisons Act</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing range</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 day to 1/3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to maximum</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

43     To be more precise, I assessed the Accused’s culpability to be in Band 2, but in the lower range. The sentencing range would thus be between 165 – 247 days’ imprisonment in Band 2, with 494 days’ imprisonment being the maximum which may be imposed for this offence.

44     I further considered that the Accused had pleaded guilty to the charge and hence, factored in a 1/3 discount from 247 days, thus arriving at 164 days’ imprisonment. I was of the view that a further reduction in the sentence was justified since the Accused returned to the halfway house on his own accord (as opposed to being arrested), after attending to his mother’s death anniversary.

45     All considered, I was in final agreement with the Prosecution’s submission that a sentence of 100 days would be appropriate for this offence under section 50Y of the Prisons Act.

## Combined Sentence under 50T and 50Y

46     Under section 50T(5) and 50(Y)(5) of the Prisons Act, both the enhanced sentences under section 50T and the sentence under section 50(Y) of the Prisons Act must run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment imposed on the Accused. Therefore, as it stands now, the total sentence imposed under the Prisons Act would be: 166 days (failure to report for urine test) + 320 days (consumption charge) + 100 days (breach of mandatory aftercare condition) = 586 days’ imprisonment. The number of days would exceed the remaining duration of the remission order of 516 days’ imprisonment (based on the date of the earliest offence committed).

47     In this respect, I note the observations made in _Norfarah_ at \[60\], that whilst there is no specific provision in the Act directly prohibiting such a sentencing result, the outcome would not be in tandem with the spirit of the CRS and MAS. It was noted that “_the structure of the CRS and MAS, in replacing the previous unconditional remission, was not intended to subject the person, who has been granted conditional remission, to additional punishment longer than what the court had previously decided as sentences for the remission offences. The CRS and MAS were meant to help the prisoners rehabilitate and reintegrate into society and not lead to an extension of their sentences previously imposed.”_ I agreed with the observations made by the court in _Norfarah_.

48     In the circumstances, whilst allowing the sentence under section 50Y of the Prisons Act to remain at 100 days’ imprisonment, I accepted the Prosecution’s final calibration of the sentences under section 50T and adjusted them accordingly:-

> (a)     Failing to report for urine test (DAC 902139/20)

>> \- (from 166 days to) 135 days’ imprisonment;

> (b)     Consumption of drug (DAC 902140/2020)

>> – (from 320 days to) 278 days’ imprisonment

49     The total sentence imposed in respect of offences punishable under sections 50T(1)(a) and 50Y(1)(a) of the Prisons Act was 513 days’ imprisonment. This number of days was close to the remaining duration of the remission order (and maximum length of enhanced sentence that may be imposed) i.e. 516 days. Notwithstanding, I had no difficulty with the fact that the punishment imposed effectively “clawed back” the entire remission period that the Accused was released under. To begin with, the Accused was not entitled to an unconditional remission for the offences he had been last convicted of.

50     As stated by the court in _Public Prosecutor v Chandrasegaran s/o Raman_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 105</span> at \[25\]:

> _In short, once the accused breaches the terms of remission, whether by committing a further offence or by breaching the terms of the remission order, he should, unless the breach was de minimis or good cause was shown, serve out the remainder of his remission period as a term of imprisonment. Anything less would lead to the perverse outcome that a recalcitrant accused who abuses the privileges of the early release programme could emerge as a free man earlier than another who had been compliant. To my mind, there is a need for a proverbial Sword of Damocles to hang over the accused’s head, providing sufficient deterrence to incentivise compliance with the rehabilitative programme designed for his eventual reintegration into society._

51     Bearing in mind the purposes of the CRS must mean that an individual who commits offences when released under a remission order should not expect anything less than receiving the remainder of his remission order as a term of imprisonment. As mentioned before, the enhanced sentence imposed must safeguard the integrity and not undermine the effective functioning of the CRS.

## Aggregate Sentence

52     I ordered the sentences in all three charges to run consecutively, along with the enhanced sentences under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act. For ease of reference, I set them out below once more:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="19.5560887822436%"> <col width="31.4737052589482%"> <col width="28.5342931413717%"> <col width="20.4359128174365%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Charge</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Number</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Punishment Prescribed</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence Imposed</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 909818/2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious breach of mandatory aftercare condition under section 50(Y)(1)(a), Prisons Act</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Max:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">494 days imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">100 days’ imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consec)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 902139/2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Failure to present for urine test</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Min:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Not specified</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Max:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 years’ impt or fine of $10,000 or both</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 months’ imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consec)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Breach of basic condition of remission order under section 50(T)(1)(a), Prisons Act</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Max:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">494 days impt</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">135 days’ imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consec)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 902140/2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumption of diamorphine with enhanced penalty under section 33A(2), MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Min:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 years impt</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Max:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 years impt</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 years’ imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consec)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Breach of a basic condition of the remission order under section 50T(1)(a), Prisons Act</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Max:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">516 days impt</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">278 days’ imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consec)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence Imposed</p></td><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 years, 8 months and 100 days’ imprisonment, with an enhanced sentence of 413 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

53     Bearing in mind the totality principle, I took a last look at the sentence to ensure that it was not crushing or excessive. Upon doing so, I was satisfied that the aggregate sentence of about nine years’ imprisonment was a fair one.

54     The mandatory imprisonment term on the Accused’s consumption charge alone was already one of seven years’ imprisonment. Having already adjusted the enhanced sentences under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act downwards having regard to the remaining duration of the remission order, I was not minded to reduce any of the sentences further. General and specific deterrence were necessary in this case in respect of this Accused.

55     As stated in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Danny Eliezer Vaswani_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 181</span> at \[70\] and with which I agree:

> _“….it still remains necessary for the court to ensure that the deterrent effect in sentencing is not diminished by overly lenient sentencing. The primacy of deterrence as a fundamental principle in sentencing defaulters of the Conditional Remission and Mandatory Aftercare Schemes is quite evident as SMS Masagos in his address to Parliament:_

>> _“However, at the end of the day, even with the additional support and aftercare provided to the ex-offender, it is ultimately the responsibility of the individual not to re-offend. If he does, he will be dealt with swiftly and strictly by the law.””_

56     If I was minded to run any sentences concurrently, I effectively only had one option i.e. to run the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment on DAC 902139/2020 (failure to report for urine test charge) concurrently with the rest of the other sentences. However, I declined to do so.

57     Apart from the charges which the Accused pleaded guilty to, there were three other charges taken into consideration in sentencing: one for consumption of methamphetamine (an LT-2 charge punishable with minimum seven years’ imprisonment) and two other charges of failing to report for urine. All these offences were also committed when he was undergoing CRS. I was of the view that the Accused’s persistence in drug abuse and drug offending had to be dealt with decisively.

58     All considered, I was satisfied that the aggregate sentence of 7 years, 8 months and 100 days’ imprisonment, with an enhanced sentence of 413 days’ imprisonment was an appropriate sentence which commensurate with the Accused’s overall criminality and culpability.
