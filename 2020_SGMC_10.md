\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9319/2019/01.\]

9 March 2020

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## INTRODUCTION

1       Mr Parmathnal Chandrasegaran, now 46 years of age, and his young son lived in a flat on the seventh floor of Block 688D Woodlands Drive 75 (the “**Flat**”). He had a girlfriend, Ms Amrita, who lived with them at the material time.

2       On the evening of 21 August 2018, the defendant and Ms Amrita had an argument. She alleged that in the course of the argument, he intimidated her with a pair of scissors, threatened to pour boiling water on her, and subsequently assaulted her physically. She called the police, who promptly arrived and arrested the defendant.

3       The defendant was charged with two counts of criminal intimidation under s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”), and one charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code. He denied all the charges and the matter proceeded to trial.

4       At the end of the trial, I did not find the evidence of Ms Amrita to be convincing and, on 26 November 2019, acquitted the defendant on all the charges. The prosecution filed the present appeal against the acquittal on 9 December 2019.

5       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charges

6       The three charges against the defendant at the start of the trial were as follows:

MAC-903260-2019 (“2nd Charge”)

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 21 August 2018, at or about 6pm, at \[the Flat\], did commit criminal intimidation by threatening one Amrita Dubey D/O Hridai Narain Dubey with injury to her person, _to wit_, by resting a pair of scissors against her neck and saying “Don’t make me stab you in the neck with this scissors right now and keep your mouth shut’’, with intent to cause her alarm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

MAC-903259-2019 (“3rd Charge”)

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 21 August 2018, at or about 6pm, at \[the Flat\], did commit criminal intimidation by threatening one Amrita Dubey D/O Hridai Narain Dubey with injury to her person, _to wit_, by telling her “Don’t talk back to me or I will take this boiling water and throw at your face now’’, with intent to cause her alarm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

MAC-911291-2018 (“4th Charge”)

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 21 August 2018, at or about 6pm, outside \[the Flat\], did voluntarily cause hurt to one Amrita Dubey D/O Hridai Narain Dubey, _to wit_, by grabbing the victim by her arms and slamming her against the wall, and thereafter punching the victim on her lips and trying to drag her into the unit, causing her bruising on the arms, swollen lips and pain in the head, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

#### Prosecution’s case

#### (a)   Ms Amrita lived with the defendant at the Flat

7       The key witness for the prosecution was Amrita Dubey D/O Hridai Narain Dubey (PW3, “**Ms Amrita**”). She testified that she was dating the defendant, and she moved in to live with him at the Flat. During this time, she helped to care for his son. She would send the boy to school in the morning and fetch him from the school in the evening. She would also make the boy’s meals, shower him in the evening and put him to bed at night.[^1]

#### (b)   Threatened with a pair of scissors

8       She testified that on 21 August 2018 (a Tuesday), at about 5 pm, she was in the kitchen preparing dinner for the boy. The defendant returned home and asked her to fetch the boy from school. As she was busy preparing dinner, she asked him to fetch the boy instead, and said that he needed to spend more time with his son. The remarks angered him, and they got into a heated argument. The defendant took a pair of scissors (Exh P3) from the drying rack above the basin and pointed the scissors at the left side of her neck, and told her to “_shut up and not argue with him, or he will stab \[her\] in the neck with the scissors”_. She was frightened and pushed his hand away, and moved away from him. He then placed the scissors down on the kitchen countertop.[^2]

#### (c)   Threatened with boiling water

9       She testified that they continued arguing. At that time she was boiling sausages. The defendant, who was standing at the entrance of the kitchen, told her, “_Don’t irritate me or I’ll take the boiling water and throw it at your face”_, and he walked away. She was worried that he would carry out the threat, and she immediately turned off the stove and poured the boiling water out of the pot.[^3]

#### (d)   Assaulted outside the Flat

10     Ms Amrita testified that she then decided to step out of the Flat to smoke a cigarette and “cool off”. While she was seated on a chair outside the Flat, the defendant came out and asked her if she was going to fetch his son. She replied that since he was not going to do it, she would, and asked him to give her ten minutes. Her comment angered him, and another argument ensued. He threw a slipper at her, grabbed and pulled her by her hair, shoved (or pushed) her against a wall, and threw a punch at her. Her head and back hit against the wall, and she fell to the ground and hit her head. When he threw a punch at her, she managed to move away and the punch grazed her lips. After that, he grabbed her by her arm and tried to drag her back into the Flat. She clung onto the gate, struggled and managed to break free, and ran to the lift.[^4]

#### (e)   Ms Amrita called the police for assistance

11     Ms Amrita testified that as soon as she entered the lift, she used her handphone to call the police for assistance.[^5]

12     The first information report (Exh P4, “**FIR**”), which was created at about 6.39 pm, was tendered in evidence. The FIR contained the following message:

> I was abused by my boyfriend. He almost stab me with a scissor and whack me outside the house. Now he is inside the house. I am the void deck. (_sic_)

13     Ms Amrita testified that while she was at the void deck, the defendant also came down and followed her. She told the defendant to stay away from her, and she walked away. She also called the police a second time.[^6] The message recorded from this second phone call was also tendered in evidence (Exh P5):

> I called earlier. He is at the void deck now also. Can the officers call me upon arrival?

14     She testified that she waited at the void deck until the police arrived. She told the police officers about what had happened. A female police officer who attended to her took photographs of her injuries. The police officers also retrieved the scissors from the Flat for her to identify. The police arrested the defendant after that.[^7]

#### (f)   Ms Amrita’s injuries

15     Two photographs of Ms Amrita’s injuries were tendered in evidence (Exh P2). These photographs were taken by the female police officer who attended to her.

16     Ms Amrita testified that from the assault by the defendant, she suffered bruises and scratches on her right arm, and bruises on her lips. Photograph P2/1 showed the scratches and bruises on her right arm, while photograph P2/2 showed her swollen lips. The bruises and scratches on her right arm were caused when the defendant grabbed her by the arm and tried to pull her into the house. The bruising at her lips was caused when the defendant attempted to punch her.[^8]

#### Amendment of charges

17     At the close of the prosecution’s case, the prosecution applied to amend the charges. The amendments were made to align the particulars of the charges with the testimony given by Ms Amrita. The time of the offence on each charge was amended to “sometime on or before 6.39pm”, to align with the time of the FIR (above, at \[12\]). The particulars of the 2nd charge involving the pair of scissors were amended to “pointing” the pair of scissors, in line with Ms Amrita’s testimony (summarised at \[8\]). The amended charges read as follows (with the changes to the original charges shown in **_bold and italics_**):

MAC-903260-2019 (“2nd Charge”)

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 21 August 2018, **_sometime on or before 6.39pm_**, at \[the Flat\], did commit criminal intimidation by threatening one Amrita Dubey D/O Hridai Narain Dubey with injury to her person, _to wit_, by **_pointing_** a pair of scissors **_at_** her neck and saying “Don’t make me stab you in the neck with this scissors right now and keep your mouth shut’’, with intent to cause her alarm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

MAC-903259-2019 (“3rd Charge”)

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 21 August 2018, **_sometime on or before 6.39pm_**, at \[the Flat\], did commit criminal intimidation by threatening one Amrita Dubey D/O Hridai Narain Dubey with injury to her person, _to wit_, by telling her “Don’t talk back to me or I will take this boiling water and throw at your face now’’, with intent to cause her alarm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

MAC-911291-2018 (“4th Charge”)

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 21 August 2018, **_sometime on or before 6.39pm_**, outside \[the Flat\], did voluntarily cause hurt to one Amrita Dubey D/O Hridai Narain Dubey, _to wit_, by grabbing the victim by her arms and slamming her against the wall, and thereafter punching the victim on her lips and trying to drag her into the unit, causing her bruising on the arms, swollen lips and pain in the head, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

#### Defence

18     The defendant was called to enter his defence and he elected to testify. The crux of his defence was that, while he was irritated with Ms Amrita that evening and they had an argument, he did not intimidate or assault her.

19     The defendant testified that on 21 August 2018, he arrived home early from work. When he arrived home at some time before 5.10 pm, he saw Ms Amrita smoking and drinking beer. He shook his head, went to the kitchen to boil some water, and had a shower. After his shower he went to check his store of beer, and found that there were only four cans of beer left. He went to confront Ms Amrita about drinking his beer, and they had an argument.[^9]

20     The argument continued while they were in the kitchen. He was asking her to fetch his son. He had a pair of scissors in his hand as he was making 3-in-1 coffee. While holding the pair of scissors, he turned around in the course of their argument, pointed the scissors, and told Ms Amrita to go fetch his son from school. He did not pick up the scissors with the intention of pointing them at her.[^10]

21     He also noticed that she was boiling sausages. He was upset that she was cooking sausages for his son again. He thus went over to carry the pot to empty it into the sink. When she asked him what he was doing, he told her, “_You move, before the water fall on you. Stop it and get out, lah. You been giving my son everyday hotdog”_. He made the remark to ask her to move away for her safety while he drained the hot water.[^11]

22     The defendant further testified that after their argument in the kitchen, Ms Amrita left the Flat and went to fetch his son. She did not go outside to smoke, and there was no argument along the corridor. He did not grab her by the arms, slam her against the wall, drag her or punch her as alleged. The scratches on her arms arose from an incident that occurred on the prior Saturday, when she was drunk, and she slipped and fell while he was carrying her.[^12]

#### Issues before the court

23     It was not in dispute that sometime before 6.39 pm, the defendant and Ms Amrita were both in the Flat and they had an argument. What was in dispute was whether he had threatened her and physically assaulted her in the manner alleged by her. There were no independent eye witnesses to what transpired between them. The case therefore turned on whether Ms Amrita’s testimony was credible and _unusually convincing_ (_AOF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 26</span>, <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> at \[111\]) such as to prove the charges against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt despite the lack of corroboration.

#### Decision

#### (a)   Ms Amrita’s testimony was not convincing

24     Having considered the testimony of Ms Amrita in light of the entirety of the evidence, I found her account to be lacking in consistency and credibility, and unconvincing.

25     Ms Amrita testified that the defendant returned home at 5 pm on the day of the incident. The tenor of her evidence was that almost immediately after he returned home, he asked her to fetch his son from school, and they started quarrelling (summarised at \[8\], above), and they continued quarrelling until after he assaulted her outside the Flat and she managed to run to the lift (above, at \[9\]-\[11\]). She immediately called the police, and that call to the police was made at about 6.39 pm (above, at \[12\]). If what she said was true, it meant that her argument with the defendant, and the incidents alleged in the charges, all took place over a prolonged period of close to one hour and 40 minutes. This, in my judgement, was highly improbable. Indeed, by her own estimation, the entire incident occurred within less than an hour.[^13]

26     Next, when Ms Amrita called the police, she reported that the defendant “_almost stab_” her with a scissor (above, at \[12\]). This was a very serious allegation. At the start of the trial, however, the 2nd charge merely alleged that the defendant was _resting_ the pair of scissors against her neck (above, at \[6\]). This was, presumably, what she subsequently told the police in the course of investigations. In her testimony in court, however, she made no mention of the defendant almost stabbing her or resting the scissors against her neck. All she said was that the defendant _pointed_ the scissors at her neck (above, at \[8\]). The prosecution rightly amended the 2nd charge to reflect what she stated in court. It was readily apparent, however, that Ms Amrita’s testimony had changed materially over time. What she first told the police, that the defendant almost stabbed her, was no doubt a grossly exaggerated account of what in fact transpired.

27     Then, Ms Amrita also testified that while she was outside the Flat, the defendant grabbed and pulled her by the _hair_, shoved her against a wall, and threw a punch at her, but she managed to move away and the punch grazed her lips (above, at \[10\]); she suffered from bruises and scratches on her arm as well as bruising at her lips. A close examination of her testimony would show, however, that her account was materially inconsistent with the particulars in the 4th charge. The charge stated that the defendant caused hurt to her by grabbing her by her _arms_ (not her hair) and _slamming_ (not merely shoving) her against the wall, and then punching her _on her lips_ (not that the punch merely grazed her lips), causing her to suffer bruising on her arms, swollen lips and _pain in her head_. Her testimony plainly did not support the particulars alleged in the 4th charge.

28     If Ms Amrita had indeed been severely assaulted by the defendant in the manner described by her, she would likely have suffered rather serious and obvious injuries. However, the photographs tendered in evidence (Exh P2) did not show any serious injury. The police officer attending to Ms Amrita did not see the need to arrange for her to be conveyed to a hospital to be examined by a doctor.[^14] Ms Amrita herself did not seek medical help. There was no medical report of the injuries she allegedly suffered. This lack of corroborative medical evidence cast serious doubt on the truth of her testimony about the severe assault she allegedly suffered at the hands of the defendant.

29     The credibility of Ms Amrita’s testimony was also undermined by her evidence as to the time she made the first phone call to the police. She testified that she made the call to the police immediately after she entered the lift (above, at \[11\]). According to the detailed records of the police, that call was made sometime between 6.37 and 6.38 pm (Exh P7). It was not in dispute that she had gone to pick up the defendant’s son from school. According to the school’s records (Exh D2), she picked up the boy at about 6.39 pm. Given this short span of time between the phone call to the police and the time she picked up the child, it seemed unlikely that she made the phone call immediately after she entered the lift. She was either telling an untruth, or her recollection was deeply flawed.

30     Further, Ms Amrita’s subsequent conduct was inconsistent with her having been severely threatened and assaulted by the defendant. After the alleged incidents, Ms Amrita did not leave the Flat, but continued to live there with the defendant for about close to two months.[^15] This called into serious question whether she had felt as fearful and intimidated by the defendant’s conduct as she claimed.

#### (b)   Inconsistencies between defendant’s statement and testimony not material

31     The prosecution made reference to the statement given by the defendant to the police (Exh P6). It was submitted that his testimony in court differed from the account recorded in his statement.[^16]

32     For example, the following was recorded in the statement:

> _I got angry and pick up a pair of scissors_ which was on the kitchen top, and while holding the pair of red coloured scissors and the tip of the scissors was point up and while holding it, I told her to go and fetch my son and I told her one day she will have to pack up and leave the house. I wish to state that I have no intention to physically harm her with the pair of scissors, _I was just holding on to it to tell her to fetch my son and was planning to hang it back after that_.[^17]

(Emphasis added in prosecution’s submissions)

33     While this statement differed to some extent from the defendant’s testimony in court (summarised above, at \[20\]), where he said that he already had the pair of scissors in his hand, it was not a _material_ inconsistency. Even if he picked up the pair of scissors and gestured with it, it did not necessarily follow that he had an intent to cause alarm to Ms Amrita. Indeed, he had consistently denied such intent both in his statement and in his oral testimony.

34     Similarly, I did not find any of the other inconsistencies highlighted by the prosecution to be material, such as to undermine the credibility of the defendant’s testimony.

#### (c)   Verdict

35     In the final analysis, I found the uncorroborated testimony of Ms Amrita to be lacking in credibility. It was not convincing, let alone _unusually convincing_. The evidence at this trial was plainly insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had intimidated Ms Amrita and caused hurt to her as alleged in the charges. I could come to no other conclusion than to find the defendant not guilty of the charges, and he was thus granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on all the charges.
