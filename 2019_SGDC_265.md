Civil Procedure – Parties – Proceedings against estates – Appointment of person to represent estate of deceased defendant for purpose of proceedings – Whether representative’s consent required

5 December 2019

### Deputy Registrar Lim Wen Juin:

1       In this application Ergo Insurance Pte Ltd (“Ergo”) sought to set aside an order I had made appointing it as the person to represent the estate of Fang Wee Shyong, deceased (the “Deceased”), the intended first defendant in this action, for the purpose of the proceedings in this action. I had made the order pursuant to O 15 r 6A(4)(_b_) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5).

2       Ergo’s ground for setting aside the order was a simple one: that it had been made without its consent. Ergo’s application thus gave rise to the question of whether it is a prerequisite for appointing a person to represent a deceased’s estate under O 15 r 6A(4) that the person consent to the appointment. It also provoked consideration of the position of a plaintiff if consent is a prerequisite and no one is prepared to consent: given that an action commenced against a deceased person “cannot continue” if there is no person representing the estate of the deceased (see the High Court decision _Tan Chwee Chye and others v P V R M Kulandayan Chettiar_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 229</span> at \[17\]), might the plaintiff through no fault of his be left without a remedy against the deceased’s estate?

3       I understood from counsel that these matters appear not to have been discussed previously in local published judicial decisions. Nonetheless the UK authorities that counsel for Ergo Mr Mahendra Prasad Rai cited at the hearing before me persuaded me to grant Ergo’s application and set aside the order I had made. Given the lack of relevant Singapore authority I think it might be useful now to publish the reasons for my decision.

4       In this action the plaintiff claims damages for personal injuries sustained in a motor accident that occurred on 23 August 2014. The plaintiff was a passenger in a lorry (the “Lorry”) driven by the Deceased that collided into the rear of another lorry. The second defendant was the owner of the Lorry as well as the employer of both the plaintiff and the Deceased. Ergo was the issuer of the commercial vehicle insurance policy for the Lorry. The plaintiff’s case is that his injuries were caused by the negligence of the Deceased in the driving of the Lorry and that the second defendant is vicariously liable for the negligence of the Deceased. The accident did not cause the death of the Deceased: he passed away in a separate motor accident some months later on 16 December 2014.

5       Unaware that the Deceased had passed away the plaintiff filed the writ commencing this action against the Deceased (named as the first defendant) and the second defendant on 23 February 2017. The plaintiff served the writ on the second defendant on 12 March 2017. Thereafter solicitors appointed by First Capital Insurance Limited (“First Capital”) entered appearance on behalf of not only the second defendant but also the Deceased on 6 April 2017. First Capital’s involvement arose from the fact that it had issued a work injury compensation insurance policy of which the second defendant was an insured entity. With the record showing that both defendants had entered appearance the action underwent Court Dispute Resolution in the usual way.

6       The plaintiff’s solicitors eventually learnt of the demise of the Deceased by way of a letter from First Capital’s solicitors dated 31 May 2018. This prompted the plaintiff to file an application on 1 August 2018 seeking the appointment of the second defendant to represent the Deceased’s estate for the purpose of the proceedings in this action. At this time First Capital’s solicitors remained as solicitors on record for the Deceased, but on 12 November 2018 they applied to discharge themselves. The basis of their application was that First Capital had given them instructions to cease acting for the Deceased because First Capital had come to take the view that it was not liable to indemnify the Deceased under the work injury compensation insurance policy.

7       On 21 May 2019 I heard both the plaintiff’s appointment application and the discharge application of First Capital’s solicitors. At the time of that hearing I thought that the main difficulty in the way of the plaintiff’s application was this: given that the Deceased had passed away years before the plaintiff filed the writ, it seemed logically to follow that the writ could not have been served on the Deceased and so had lapsed as against the Deceased and by now become incapable of renewal. Although O 10 r 1(3) in the Rules of Court provides that the effect of the appearance entered on behalf of the Deceased by First Capital’s solicitors is that the writ is “deemed to have been duly served” on the Deceased, O 10 r 1(3) is expressly stated to be subject to O 12 r 6, which provides that the appearance entered on his behalf “shall not be treated as a waiver by him of any irregularity in the writ or service thereof”. In response counsel for the plaintiff Mr Joseph Chen contended that the conduct of First Capital’s solicitors in not only entering appearance on behalf of the Deceased but also participating in the Court Dispute Resolution process gave rise to an estoppel that prevents any representative of the estate of the Deceased from asserting that service of the writ on the Deceased was irregular or a nullity. I thought that this was at least an arguable point. I agreed with Mr Chen that the plaintiff could not reasonably be faulted for not having discovered earlier the fact that the Deceased had passed away. I therefore thought it right to appoint a personal representative for the Deceased’s estate given that the representative would then be at liberty to challenge the deemed service of the writ on the Deceased.

8       As to the question of the identity of the representative to be appointed, Mr Chen submitted that the second defendant would be suitable because he had been the employer of the Deceased. There was no indication that the second defendant had given consent to be appointed. Mr Chen explained that his enquiries had not revealed any other suitable representative: there had been no grant of probate or administration in respect of the Deceased’s estate, and he had not met success in his attempts to ascertain from First Capital’s solicitors the particulars of the family members of the Deceased. I took the view that it would not be appropriate to appoint the second defendant because as a co-defendant his interests might not necessarily be aligned with those of the estate of the Deceased. But at the same time it seemed to me that the plaintiff had taken reasonable steps to identify a suitable representative and was not to be blamed for the dearth of candidates. Hence I thought it fair and just to appoint a representative at once in order that the plaintiff’s action against the Deceased’s estate might not be stymied. My understanding was that Ergo would as the Lorry’s motor insurer be bound under s 9(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) to satisfy any judgment obtained by the plaintiff against the Deceased’s estate, and I considered that this meant that the interests of Ergo and the estate were in sufficient alignment that Ergo would be an apt representative. Mr Chen made it clear to me that Ergo had not given consent to be appointed as such even though he had asked, but I did not think this an obstacle to appointing Ergo and I ordered its appointment accordingly. I also allowed the discharge application of First Capital’s solicitors.

9       On 12 June 2019 Ergo applied to set aside the order of appointment I had made. I heard this application on 4 October 2019. Mr Rai cited three authorities from the UK. One was a decision of the English Court of Appeal, _Pratt v London Passenger Transport Board; Green v Vandekar_ \[1937\] 1 All ER 473 (“_Pratt_”). The other two emanated from the High Court of Justice of Northern Ireland, namely _Firth Finance and General Limited v McNarry_ \[1987\] NI 125 (“_Firth Finance_”), a decision of Murray J, and _Steven Turner and Carol Turner v Patrick Kearney_ \[2010\] NIMaster 10 (“_Turner_”), a decision of Master Bell. Mr Rai relied on _Pratt_ and _Firth Finance_ and sought to distinguish _Turner_.

10     I was satisfied on the basis of _Pratt_ and _Firth Finance_ that it is a well-established general proposition in the UK that the court may not appoint a person to represent the estate of a deceased person for the purpose of court proceedings unless the person to be appointed consents to the appointment. As a matter of principle consent is required because the appointed representative may need to incur expense in participating in the proceedings on behalf of the deceased’s estate (see the speech of Greer LJ in _Pratt_ at 476A–B, and see too _Firth Finance_ at 127D). I agreed that it would not be fair to impose the burdens and obligations of the appointment on a person who does not consent to taking them on, and so I was inclined to follow _Pratt_ and _Firth Finance_.

11     I did not think it mattered that in _Pratt_ the language of the relevant provision in the English Rules of the Supreme Court was different from that of O 15 r 6A(4) in our Rules of Court, which was the provision engaged in this case. The language of the English provision was instead closer to that of O 15 r 15(1) in our Rules of Court. Although in a technical sense O 15 r 6A(4) and O 15 r 15(1) cover different ground, in that the latter is concerned with deceased persons who are not already parties to the action either as plaintiff or as defendant but are “interested in the matter in question” (see the High Court decision _Wong Moy (administratrix of the estate of Theng Chee Khim, deceased) v Soo Ah Choy_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 822</span> at \[22\]) whereas the former is concerned with deceased persons who have been sued as defendant, I thought the principle was the same. In any event, in _Pratt_ one of the deceased persons for whom a representative was to be appointed was a defendant (at 476F–G) and it was held that consent was equally required from such a representative, meaning that it did not make a difference whether the deceased was or was not already a party to the action. Moreover, I thought that _Firth Finance_ was squarely on point because the relevant provision in the Rules of the Supreme Court applicable to Northern Ireland was in substance identical to O 15 r 6A(4). I was thus satisfied that if I followed _Pratt_ and _Firth Finance_ the personal representative’s consent would be required whether the appointment is to be made under O 15 r 6A(4) or O 15 r 15(1).

12     From the point of view of a plaintiff who has sued a deceased defendant it may seem unjust that he cannot have a person appointed as representative without that person’s consent. It is quite conceivable that all the intimates of the deceased with whom the plaintiff manages to establish contact might decline to represent the deceased’s estate. It might then seem that the plaintiff is stuck, for if there is no representative of the deceased’s estate then the plaintiff’s action cannot continue against the estate. This was the reason why I had seen fit in the first place to appoint Ergo to represent the Deceased’s estate notwithstanding the lack of consent from Ergo. But I was persuaded by the reasoning of Murray J in _Firth Finance_ that requiring the representative’s consent does not leave the plaintiff without recourse. The solution is that the plaintiff may “apply to have their own nominee appointed by the court as the representative defendant” (at 127D–E). I elaborate on this in the course of and after addressing _Turner_.

13     In _Turner_ Master Bell took the view that it would not be correct to follow _Pratt_ and _Firth Finance_ in certain circumstances, but I accepted Mr Rai’s argument that _Turner_ could be distinguished on the simple basis that Master Bell was bound to apply the UK Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights but the Singapore courts are not. What Master Bell held was that although the court “will be slow to appoint a personal representative who does not consent” the right to a fair trial conferred by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights required that the court appoint a non-consenting person as representative if not appointing that person would have “the effect of denying a plaintiff access to the courts”: at \[28\]. On the facts of _Turner_ the plaintiffs were “unable to gain the consent of a responsible, professional person to be appointed” to represent the estate of the deceased defendant, such that the only course available to them was to appoint a “puppet” as representative, and Master Bell held that the appointment of such a “puppet” who “would then deliberately agree to allow the action to be lost by default” would “make a mockery of what is supposed to be an adversarial litigation process and would not amount to a fair trial of the issues between the parties”: at \[29\]. Master Bell concluded that it was right in the circumstances not to follow _Pratt_ and _Firth Finance_ and to appoint the deceased’s widow to represent his estate for the purpose of accepting service of the writ even though she had not consented to the appointment.

14     It was not suggested that there is in Singapore a right equivalent or similar to the right to a fair trial set out in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Absent such a right, I did not think that it was objectionable in principle to permit a plaintiff to appoint a “puppet” to represent the estate of a deceased defendant. This does not mean of course that the plaintiff is given _carte blanche_ to appoint whomsoever he wishes. Ideally the representative should be someone closely connected to the deceased, for instance a spouse or family member or trusted friend. If there is no such person willing to consent then the next-best alternative will in all likelihood be a “responsible, professional person” (in the words of Master Bell in _Turner_). But if even such a professional person proves elusive I see no good reason to restrict the class of candidates to whom the plaintiff might have resort. If the plaintiff satisfies the court that he has taken all reasonable steps to bring in someone appropriate to represent the deceased defendant’s estate but has not been able to secure consent from anyone, in my opinion it would be wholly fair and just to appoint the plaintiff’s nominee, even a “puppet”, given that the blameless plaintiff would otherwise be left without a remedy. This is provided that the plaintiff has given notice of his proposed appointment to all persons who to his knowledge may have interests aligned with those of the deceased defendant’s estate, even if those persons may previously have intimated an unwillingness to represent the estate: as Murray J pointed out in _Firth Finance_ (at 128B), this is because the attitude of those persons “may change” when they learn that the plaintiff is proposing to appoint his own nominee. I did not understand Mr Rai to take any issue with these views.

15     Once the plaintiff has had his nominee appointed to represent the deceased’s estate, he may carry on the proceedings against the estate. I would think that in participating in the proceedings the plaintiff’s nominee owes some basic duty to the deceased’s estate – perhaps a duty not to act in bad faith – but I would imagine it very easy to fulfil this duty if indeed no one else has stepped forward to represent the estate despite having been given the opportunity to do so. Thus I should assume that the plaintiff would inevitably obtain judgment against the estate. If by that time no grant of probate or administration has been made the estate will be bound by the judgment in accordance with O 15 r 6A(8). The plaintiff may then enforce the judgment against the estate and any other appropriate parties. At the hearing before me Mr Chen expressed the concern that if the plaintiff obtained judgment against the Deceased’s estate and sought to enforce it against Ergo he might encounter resistance from Ergo. But I did not think that this was a real concern. I thought that unless there is some significant unreasonableness in the way that the plaintiff’s nominee or “puppet” conducts the litigation – I had in mind an extreme case of the nominee consenting to judgment for a disproportionately and unjustifiably high sum of damages – Ergo would by reason of its having made a choice at this time not to represent the Deceased’s estate be taken to have waived its right to object to the judgment, or it would be estopped from doing so, or it would be an abuse of process for it so to object, assuming of course that Ergo is the proper party against whom the judgment is to be enforced. Again I did not understand Mr Rai to suggest that these views were in any way erroneous.

16     It was suggested that the existence of an express reference to the Public Trustee’s consent in O 15 r 6A(6) in the Rules of Court implies that consent is not required for the appointment of all other persons. But I did not accept this argument. What O 15 r 6A(6) provides is that when the court appoints the Public Trustee to represent a deceased’s estate for the purpose of court proceedings the default position is that the appointment “shall be limited to \[the Public Trustee’s\] accepting service of the writ or originating summons”, and if the Public Trustee’s appointment is to extend to taking any further step in the proceedings the court must specifically direct so but only “with the consent of the Public Trustee”. I thought that it would be reading too much into this provision to hold that it follows by implication that the court may appoint any person other than the Public Trustee without that person’s consent. It seemed to me more likely that O 15 r 6A(6) was meant to dispel all doubt as to the position of the Public Trustee than that it was intended to draw a sweeping distinction between the Public Trustee and other persons on the broad subject of consent.

17     For the reasons above I was satisfied that setting aside the appointment of Ergo to represent the Deceased’s estate would not cause the plaintiff insuperable prejudice in proceeding against the estate in this action. I accepted the proposition of law in _Pratt_ and _Firth Finance_ that the court may not appoint a representative without his consent, and given that Ergo did not consent to be appointed to represent the Deceased’s estate I set aside the appointment.
