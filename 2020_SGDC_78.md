### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Chen Dongjun, a 29 year old male Chinese national, claimed trial to three charges of importing health products without a valid importer’s licence under s 13(1) of the Health Products Act, Cap 122D (“HPA”). He was represented by Mr Wee Hong Shern during the trial. At the end of the trial, I found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him accordingly. On 7 January 2020, I imposed jail terms for all three charges and sentenced him to a total of 13 weeks’ imprisonment. On the same day, the accused’s new counsel, Mr Raymond Tiah, informed the court that the accused is appealing against his sentence but not his conviction. The accused is presently on bail pending his appeal.

2       The sentences that I imposed in this case are set out in the table below.

## Findings at trial

5       Since the accused is not appealing against his conviction, I shall not go into the details regarding the trial except to briefly state why I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven all three charges against him beyond a reasonable doubt. In this regard, the Prosecution had tendered comprehensive written submissions for both the ancillary hearing and the main trial as to why the Prosecution’s case should be accepted. For the reasons as set out in the Prosecution’s submissions, I preferred the versions of events as recounted by the Prosecution witnesses, PW1 Investigation Officer Chew Hock Tat and PW2 Tan Mei Xian, a regulatory inspector in HSA. Both PW1 and 2 also corroborated each other’s evidence in the material aspects. Their evidence was further substantiated by documentary evidence. On the other hand, the accused’s evidence was internally and externally inconsistent hence I chose not to believe his defence.

6       The salient facts adduced from the trial were these. The accused disclosed in his confession in exhibit P9 which I ruled to be voluntary that several persons in the vicinity of New Cathay Hotel (located in Geylang) had approached him to buy sexual enhancement drugs. He was running out of money and realised that he could earn some money by selling these products. He also had a ready buyer. So he went online and found one China supplier who had stocks in Bangkok and could deliver the goods to the accused. The accused placed his orders and provided an address and his mobile number to the supplier. He also gave his friend Xu Aihang’s number to the supplier as a backup contact. The supplier provided the accused two parcel numbers but the accused was called up for investigations while waiting for his parcels to arrive. From the SOAF (see \[4\] above), the sexual enhancement drugs ordered by the accused arrived in two parcels on 2 Jan 2018 (subject of the first charge) and 9 Jan 2018 (subject of the second and third charges) respectively.

7       I should also mention that it has now come to my attention that s 52 of the HPA provides that where any health product or active ingredient is supplied in a package, any person who appears from any statement thereon or attached thereto to have imported or manufactured that health product or active ingredient, shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to have so imported or manufactured the health product or active ingredient. Since the accused’s name appeared as the consignee on both parcels, it could be argued that the presumption in s 52 of the HPA applied in this case. This provision was not referred to during the trial and there was no reliance on the presumption that it provides.  Therefore, there is no necessity to address this point.

## Antecedents

8       The accused was a first offender.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

9       The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of at least 15 weeks’ imprisonment. It relied on two unreported precedents namely _PP v Xu Aihang_ and _PP v Jin Hankai_ where the accused pleaded guilty to arrive at its indicative trial sentencing ranges and the proposed individual sentences. It also submitted that the first and third charges should run consecutively as tabulated below.

10     The Prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors:

> 1)     Offences involving the importation of parcels from overseas online sources were harder to detect unlike offenders who were caught red-handed with actual possession of prohibited items at Singapore’s checkpoints.

> 2)     The offences were profit-motivated as the imported health products were meant for illicit sale in Geylang and not for personal consumption.

> 3)     The accused made numerous false allegations when conducting his trial and “besmirched” the reputation of PW1, a recognised aggravating factor (see _Chang Yam Song v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 142</span> at \[44\] and \[45\]).

## Mitigation

11     The mitigation plea may be summarised as follows:

> 1)     The accused aged 29 was single. His family consisted of his mother and siblings who resided in China.

> 2)     He came to Singapore on 7 July 2017 to work in order to support his single mother who was failing in her health.

> 3)     He had borrowed money from his friends and family so that he could obtain the necessary documents such as a work permit to work in Singapore.

> 4)     The accused worked odd jobs and only earned $1000 a month and he lived a prudent life in Singapore so that he could remit most of his savings to his family in China.

> 5)     The accused was remorseful and wished to serve his sentence and return to China urgently to care for his mother.

> 6)     He had come to Singapore to make an honest living but faced dire financial circumstances after his work permit was revoked due to the investigations into his friend, Xu Aihang. He had committed the offences to support himself and to continue to remit his earnings to China to support his family.

> 7)     He had to fork out $250 per month for rental of a shared HDB room and split the balance between living expenses and funds to be remitted to support his ageing mother in China. As such he readily accepted his friend’s proposal to earn a little extra income by selling health supplements.

> 8)     Being a foreigner, the accused did not understand the gravity of the offences he had committed. He undertook not to re-offend.

> 9)     He implored for the mercy of the court and worried about his single mother’s ability to provide for herself during his incarceration.

> 10)     The Defence also urged the court to consider the one-transaction principle as stated by the Learned Chief Justice in _PPv Raveeen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> at \[39\] and order concurrent sentences when there was violation of only one single legal interest.

12     Insofar as the global and individual sentences were concerned, the Defence agreed with the range of trial sentences as submitted by the Prosecution at \[9\] above. It urged the court to impose the lower end of Prosecution’s proposed range of sentences and order the first and third charges to run consecutively thus making a global sentence of 13 weeks’ imprisonment as follows[^1]:

## Prescribed punishment

13     The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 13 of the HPA is a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.

## Legislative background and the regulatory regime of the HPA

14     It would be relevant to set out the legislative background behind the HPA. In a move to “_consolidate and streamline the existing medicines controls laws_”[^2], the HPA was enacted in 2007 as a single law to cover the regulation of different types of health products. It was to be implemented in phases and structured such that different categories of products would be regulated to different degree based on their risk profiles. For a start, the HPA only regulated medical devices. The plan was to eventually bring pharmaceutical medicines controlled under the Medicines Act, Cap 176 (“MA”) and the Poisons Act, Cap 234 (“PA”) under the HPA. When that happened, Parliament would repeal the MA, PA and Sale of Drugs Act[^3]. On 1 November 2016, pharmaceutical products were transferred from the MA and PA to the ambit of the HPA as “therapeutic products” with the passing of the _Health Products (Therapeutic Products) Regulations 2016_ (“HP(TP) Regulations”).

15     S 13(1) read with s 13(6)(a) of the HPA was based on a similar provision in s 5 read with s 16 of the PA. S 5 of the PA criminalises the unlicensed importation and sale of poisons. The punishment prescribed for breach of s 5 of the PA was originally a maximum fine of $1,000 or maximum jail term of six months’ imprisonment or both. In 1980, the maximum penalty was enhanced to a fine of $5,000 or two years’ imprisonment or both. In 1987, the maximum fine was further increased from $5,000 to $10,000 with no change to the jail term. The then Acting Minister for Health, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, noted during the second reading of the Poisons (Amendment) Bill that the existing penalties were “_inadequate for the gravity of the offences that are being committed_”[^4]. In 2007, during the second reading of the Health Products Bill, Parliament acknowledged that the penalties under the existing medicines laws were outdated thus it had “_updated the penalties where appropriate_”[^5] to serve as a deterrent[^6]. Consequently, the maximum fine under s 13(6)(a) of the HPA was prescribed at $50,000, five times that under the PA while the maximum jail term remained unchanged at two years’ imprisonment.

16     Aside from the relevant legislative developments mentioned above, it would also be important to note the three levels of access controls for therapeutic products or pharmaceutical drugs in Singapore as described in the following forensic classifications:

> 1)     Prescription Only Medicines (“POM”) which can only be obtained with a prescription from a medical professional.

> 2)     Pharmacy Only Medicines which can be obtained from a pharmacist at a retail pharmacy.

> 3)     General Sale List which can be freely obtained from any retailer.

17     POM has the most stringent access restrictions under the HPA because the product poses a danger to human health if used incorrectly or used without a doctor’s monitoring or follow up. Products containing the active ingredients Sidenafil (subject of the 1st and 3rd charges) and Tadalafil (subject of the 2nd charge) are meant for treatment of erectile dysfunction[^7] which can only be obtained by prescription.

## Sentencing considerations

### Deterrence as the primary sentencing consideration

## Legislative intent

18     As evident from the legislative background and enhancements made to the maximum prescribed punishment over the years, deterrence is clearly the primary sentencing consideration for offences under the HPA. A similar approach was taken by the High Court in _Tan Gek Young v PP and another appeal (“Tan Gek Young”) <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 203</span>. Tan Gek Young_ was a case involving the illicit sale of codeine cough preparations prosecuted under the old provision[^8] of s 6(1)(a)(i) read with s 16 of the PA and other offences under the PA and MA. The High Court, which heard the appeal against sentence, examined the legislative background of the PA and held at \[43\] that “_deterrence was indubitably the primary sentencing consideration for the offences under the Poisons Act_” for two reasons:

> 1)     In enhancing the prescribed maximum sentences for the offences under the PA, Parliament must have had deterrence in mind as the two enhancements in 1980 and 1987 were accompanied by statements by the respective Ministers about the need to deter illicit supply of poisons;

> 2)     The illicit supply of poisons fell into many of the circumstances identified in _PP v Law Aik Meng <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 33</span>_ where general deterrence would assume significance and relevance in sentencing.

19     It would be noted that the High Court had also opined in _Tan Gek Young_ at \[43\] that when Parliament increased the maximum fine the third time (in the HPA in 2007), it could have been due to the need for flexibility given the wider range of health products being regulated. The High Court went on to state that the appeal did not engage the HPA but as far as the PA was concerned, there could be no doubt that “_sentencing must be informed by deterrence_.” In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution[^9] that Parliament had revisited the inadequacies of the penalties in the PA during the second reading of the Health Products Bill in 2007 and had updated the penalties upwards for deterrent purposes[^10]:

> _The penalty provisions in this Bill have also been updated and this is certainly necessary. For example, the maximum court fine for the offence of providing false information in the process of applying for a licence under the Medicines Act is only $5,000. The maximum fine for a corresponding offence in the proposed Health Products Act has been adjusted to $20,000. This will serve as a deterrent and will certainly stress the seriousness with which such penalties are being viewed…_

### Circumstances warranted deterrence

20     In _Law Aik Meng_, the High Court identified several situations where a sentencing approach based on deterrence was required. It held at \[24\] and \[25\], amongst others, that general deterrence would assume significance and relevance in sentencing in the following circumstances:

> 1)     Offences affecting public safety, public health, public services, public or widely used facilities or public security;

> 2)     Offences affecting several victims; and

> 3)     Difficulty of detection.

21     I agreed with the Prosecution that a deterrent sentence was warranted in the present case because the offences fell within the circumstances set out at \[20\] above. The therapeutic products in question are medicine which could only be obtained by prescriptions. Unsupervised consumption of these illicit sexual enhancement tablets posed serious health risks to the public as it could result in death[^11]. These illegally imported tablets also came from dubious sources and they may contain undeclared potent ingredients or more active ingredients than necessary. The conditions under which they were manufactured and stored were also unknown. Thus, the offences presented many health risks to the public. The tablets were also intended for sale in the black market by peddlers in Geylang and they could potentially harm many victims. The offences were also difficult to detect as the accused had ordered them online and the offences only came to light when the parcels were intercepted by ICA[^12].

### Other aggravating factors

### Large quantities of illicit sexual enhancement tablets involved

22     The amounts of illicit sexual enhancement tablets involved in the three charges were substantial: 3524 (first charge), 1,240 (second charge) and 1,772 (third charge). The large quantities indicated that it was not a small scale illegal operation that the accused was running. The extent of potential harm to public health would also increase correspondingly to the numbers of the illegally imported tablets released in the black market. In my view, the vast amounts of illegally imported tablets was an aggravating factor.

### No remorse

23     The accused had shown no remorse. While he was entitled to claim trial to the offences, he had made several false allegations against PW1 Chew Hock Tat, the Investigation Officer such as asserting that PW1 had induced him into giving a false confession[^13]. By claiming trial, the accused was also not entitled to any discount in sentencing.

### Mitigating factors

24     I noted that the accused was a first offender. Aside from this, there was no real mitigating factor.

### Sentencing Precedents

25     I also had regard to the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution (the Defence did not tender any). It would be noted that the Defence agreed with the range of sentences as submitted by the Prosecution except that it urged the court to impose the sentences at the minimum end of the spectrum[^14].

26     The two precedents relied on by the Prosecution were _PP v Jin Hankai_ (“Jin”) and _PP v Xu Aihang_ (“Xu”). Although they were unreported cases, they were useful guides in assisting the court to arrive at the appropriate sentences. _Jin_ was a case involving unlicensed importation of sexual medicines dealt with under s 5 of the PA before the control of pharmaceutical products was transferred from the PA to the HPA through the HP(TP) Regulations. Jin was therefore a relevant precedent but bearing in mind that the maximum punishment under s 5 of the PA was a fine of $10,000 and/or 2 years’ jail term. _Xu_ was a more recent precedent as it was prosecuted under the new s 13 of the HPA, similar to the present case. According to the Prosecuting counsel, while there had been prosecutions under the HPA for supply of sexual enhancement medicines under s 15 of the HPA, _Xu_ was the only precedent involving unlicensed importation of sexual enhancement medicines under s 13 of the HPA. The Prosecution attributed the lack of precedents to the relatively recent enactment of the HP (TP) Regulations which came into effect on 1 Nov 2016.

### PP v Jin Hankai (“Jin”)

27     The accused in Jin was a 25 year old Chinese national. He faced a total of 17 charges under the PA, some of which were abetment charges. He pleaded guilty to seven proceeded charges with the remaining 10 charges taken into consideration. Two of the proceeded charges were respectively for unlicensed importation of 16,298 tablets and 7,113 tablets containing sildenafil under s 5 of the PA. The accused received respective sentences of 16 weeks’ imprisonment and 14 weeks’ imprisonment for these two offences. For completeness, his sentences are tabulated below with the relevant sentences highlighted for easy reference.

### PP v Xu Aihang (“Xu”)

28     The accused in _Xu_, a 27 year old Chinese national, faced a total of 55 charges, 38 charges under the HPA and 17 charges under the PA. He pleaded guilty to 17 proceeded charges and consented to have the remaining 38 charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. One of the proceeded charges was under s 13(1) of the HPA and there was also one proceeded charge under s 5 of the PA for unlicensed importation of sildenafil, an active ingredient similarly present in the sexual enhancement tablets which are the subject of the first and third charges in the current case. The accused was a first offender. For completeness, his sentences are tabulated below. It would be noted that he received a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment for unlicensed importation of 3995 tablets of Viagra under s 13 of the HPA (similar in quantity to 3524 tablets of Ranbaxy Caverta 100 in the first charge) and 15 weeks’ imprisonment for licensed importation of 9,496 capsules containing sildenafil under s 5 of the PA. These two sentences are highlighted in the table for easy reference.

31     As the present case involved three proceeded charges, pursuant to s 307(1) Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68, at least two of the imprisonment terms would be required to run consecutively. In _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> at \[81(d)\], the High Court held that in ordering consecutive sentences, the cumulative sentence should be longer than the longest individual sentence. I therefore had the options of ordering all three sentences to run consecutively or alternatively order the first charge to run consecutively with either the second or the third charge.

32     I did not order all three sentences to run consecutively as I was of view that having two sentences to run consecutively would act as sufficient deterrence given that the accused was a first offender. Besides, ordering more than two sentences to run consecutively is only done in “exceptional cases”[^15].

33     The offence in the first charge occurred on 2 Jan 2018 arising from one parcel while the offences in the second and third charges were committed a week later on 9 Jan 2018 arising from another parcel. I therefore decided to order the first charge to run consecutively with the third charge in order to reflect the overall culpability of the accused.

34     In my view, the aggregate sentence of 13 weeks’ imprisonment did not offend the totality principle and was in no way a crushing sentence. It was also in line with what the Defence had submitted for, that the first and third charges should run consecutively making a total of 13 weeks’ imprisonment[^16].

## Conclusion

35     For the reasons stated, the sentences I have imposed are appropriate and not manifestly excessive.

36     The Accused is currently on bail pending his appeal.
