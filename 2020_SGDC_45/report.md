\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9022/2020/01.\]

28 February 2020

### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

The accused, 19 years old, pleaded guilty to one count of house trespass with intention to commit theft (“house trespass offence”) of a safe containing cash of $1,000, with two others, which offence is punishable under section 451 read with section 34 of the Penal Code Cap 224 (“PC”).

2       He was previously sentenced to 15 months’ probation for one count of theft under section 379 PC for stealing $500 (“previous theft offence”). One other charge of theft of $60, under section 379 PC, was taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing.

3       As the accused had committed the above house trespass offence while he was on probation, a probation progress report dated 21 October 2019 (“Progress Report”), a supplementary progress report dated 3 January 2020 (“Supplementary Report”), as well as a reformative training suitability report (“RT Report”) were called, to assess the accused’s suitability for either probation or reformative training.

4       On 21 January 2020, in clear breach of the probation order, I sentenced the accused to undergo reformative training (“RT”) for the minimum period detention of 12 months at the Reformative Training Centre (“RTC”) for the current offence as well as for the previous offence of theft for which he was granted probation (see section 9(5) of the Probation of Offenders Act, Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed (“POA”)[^1]). The accused was given time to defer serving his sentence to 29 January 2020.

5       However, a Notice of Appeal against sentence was filed on 28 January 2020 by the defence (who had engaged another law firm), following which a stay of execution on the sentence of RT was granted on 29 January 2020. The accused is currently on bail pending the appeal.

6       I now give reasons for not imposing a second probation order for the accused’s current offence as well as the previous theft offences.

## Charge

7       The proceeded charge states as follows:

> **DAC 922132/2019**

> You, Wong Kang Jun, 19 years old, are charged that you, on 28th March 2019 sometime between 3.30 pm to 5.00 pm, at Blk 525 Hougang Ave 6 #XXX, Singapore, together with one Teo Jun Xiong and Ritesh Revanna, in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did commit house trespass in order to commit theft, to wit, Teo Jun Xiong and Ritesh Revanna both entered the said building which is used for the custody of property, in order to commit theft of one black safe, which contained a sum of money amounting to $1000/-, in the possession of XXX, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 451 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Summary of Facts

8       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts pertaining to the above charge, without qualification. The salient points are as follows:

> (a)     The victim is 19 years old and the accused persons’ schoolmate. The co-accused persons are Ritesh Revanna (“Ritesh”) and Teo Jun Xiong (“Jun Xiong”), both 18 years old at the material time. The complainant is the victim’s neighbour.

> (b)     On 28 March 2019, at about 5.09pm, the complainant called the police stating that she had seen two persons entering her neighbour’s unit.

> (c)     A week prior to the material time, the accused persons planned to go to the victim’s house to steal his safe box and to split the contents therein amongst themselves. The accused’s role was to distract the victim by inviting him for lunch at a shopping mall nearby while the co-accused persons would steal the safe box from the victim’s home. The accused knew from his previous visits to the victim’s home that the latter never locked or secured the unit door and the metal gate.

> (d)     On 28 March 2019 at about 2pm, the accused told the co-accused persons to be ready to make their way to the victim’s home to steal the safe box. At about 3pm on the same day, the accused went to the victim’s home and invited him out for lunch, which the victim accepted.

> (e)     While the accused was having lunch with the victim, the accused informed Ritesh through a phone message that he could go to the victim’s home. Sometime between 3.30 to 5.00pm, the co-accused persons entered the victim’s home to steal the safe box, which was found in a cupboard in the victim’s room. At the material time, the safe box contained cash amounting to $1,000. The co-accused persons proceeded to carry the safe out of the victim’s home.

> (f)     Due to the vigilance of the complainant, she spotted the co-accused persons leaving the victim’s home with the safe box. She confronted them and told them to return the safe to the victim’s home, which they complied. Further, they apologised and implored the complainant not to call the police. Subsequently, the victim returned home alone and was informed by the complainant that his friends attempted to steal his safe box and that the two of them were near the road. Thereafter, the complainant called the police.

## Antecedents

9       On 13 August 2018, the accused was sentenced to 15 months’ split probation (4 months’ intensive and 11 months’ supervised) for theft offences (see \[2\] above). The accused was further ordered to comply with the following additional conditions:

> a)     Time restrictions between 10pm to 6am;

> b)     To be placed on the electronic monitoring scheme for a period of 4 months;

> c)     To perform 150 hours of community service;

> d)     To attend the Theft Intervention Programme, if found suitable.

> Additionally, the accused’s parents were ordered to execute a bond of $5,000 to ensure the accused’s good behaviour.

## Chronology of events

10     Below is the chronology of events in relation to the previous theft offences committed by the accused in 2018 and 2017 (including the TIC charge) and the various reports that were called for thereafter (see Prosecution’s Skeletal Address on Sentence).

## Prosecution’s submissions

11     The prosecution submitted for a sentence of RT to be imposed for the following reasons (see Prosecution’s Skeletal Address on Sentence):

> a)      **The latest offence in question is serious :** the offence of house trespass with intent to commit theft carries mandatory imprisonment of up to 7 years as well as a discretionary fine; furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence are aggravating in that it was a group offence with elements of premeditation as well;

> b)      **The accused’s pattern of offending significantly displaces the focus on rehabilitation and where a greater emphasis on deterrence within an overarching emphasis on rehabilitation was necessary:** this was in view of the accused’s repeated offending where he was placed on a Guidance Programme (“GP”) in 2017 for a theft offence (TIC charge) but breached the programme requirements where the GP was extended for a further 3 months, which was subsequently breached by committing the theft offence in 2018 (resulting in the probation order being imposed). The accused’s offending behaviour escalated in severity for the current offence where the value of the stolen property involved has also increased. The accused’s role was to deliberately lure the victim away from his home so that the co-accused persons could execute the plan of stealing the safe box without fear of the victim returning and foiling their plans;

> c)      **There was a lack of genuine remorse**: in the RT report, the accused tried to minimise his responsibility by denying that he had committed past offences in school, despite these being corroborated by the probation report and even his mother, as well as minimising his role in the present offence by stating that he had only distracted the victim;

> d)      **Whether there is cause for assurance that the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail have been effectively addressed**: Whilst it is noted by the Probation Officer, Mr Li Zhihui (“PO”) in the Supplementary Report that the accused had made a concerted effort to improve his progress on probation since October 2019, it was submitted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that the risk factors have been addressed at their root:

>> i)       The risk factors identified in the Probation Report were the accused’s pro-criminal attitude and defiance towards authority; lack of discipline and poor frustration tolerance; inconsistent parenting styles and inadequate supervision in controlling the accused’s behaviour. These were evidently not addressed by the time the Progress Report was prepared given that the accused had re-offended on probation and the PO did not recommend probation to continue.

>> ii)       The improved behaviour as noted in the Supplementary Report was primarily based on the PO’s assessment within a limited period between October to December 2019 and does not account for other external factors such as the accused’s then-upcoming graduation from ITE which would arguably have been contingent on requirements such as improved attendance in school. It was further submitted that there was nothing in the Supplementary Report, which suggests that any of the risk factors have been adequately addressed.

>> iii)       The accused’s diagnosis of Pathological Gambling does not excuse or justify the accused’s offending behaviour. There was a high degree of planning and premeditation involved which showed that the accused had clearly applied his mind and knew the consequences of his offending conduct. Whilst the accused is currently receiving counselling from the National Addictions Management Service (“NAMS”) at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”), it was also noted that the accused had defaulted on his appointments from August to October 2019, thereby casting doubt on the degree of commitment that the accused genuinely has in overcoming his addiction to online sports gambling.

> e)     There is a **need for specific deterrence and prevention of crime**: In light of the above observations as well as the clear escalation in the accused’s offending conduct and pattern of reoffending in breach of existing obligations, there is a pressing need to give effect to the principle of specific deterrence. The accused’s risk of re-offending was assessed to be moderate, which does not appear to have changed even in the Supplementary Report, suggesting that the principle of deterrence should also be given effect to in the eventual sentence to be imposed. The accused has been given ample opportunity to turn over a new leaf and he should not be given credit for making progress now, when abiding by the stipulated conditions were the terms which were expected of him in the beginning (when probation was first imposed). There is thus a heightened need for deterrence – both general and specific --- for which RT would be the most appropriate sentence.

## Mitigation

12     The defence submitted for a second chance and for a second probation order to be imposed for the following reasons (see Written Mitigation dated 20 January 2020):

> a)     The accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to the current offence, thus saving resources for both the courts and the prosecution;

> b)     He had co-operated with the authorities and readily admitted to the above offence, thus evincing genuine remorse;

> c)     The accused had committed the current offence, out of ‘sheer desperation’, when he started gambling again in early 2019, under the influence of his friends, which resulted in him incurring a debt of almost $10,000. He deeply regrets his actions and has since ceased associating with these negative peers;

> d)     The accused’s parents are committed to give their unwavering support and to supervise the accused to ensure that he stays out of trouble;

> e)     There was no real loss incurred by the victim for the current offence;

> f)     The accused had demonstrated ‘good potential for reform’ in that he is willing to make changes to his life to ensure that he steers clear from trouble with the law; he has displayed a positive attitude by improving his attendance in school, resulting in him graduating from ITE with a Nitec certificate in December 2019; he has since completed community service under the first probation order and has been attending counselling sessions at the IMH for his gambling addiction;

> g)     Whilst the accused was initially found not to be suitable for probation (see Progress Report), the accused, has since after his remand in prisons, for purposes of assessing his suitability for RT, fully appreciated the consequences of his actions and ‘clearly demonstrated his capability for reform[^2]’ as seen above at (f);

> h) In light of the above, it was submitted that there is an ‘absence of risk factors’ such as negative peers and gambling issues, where he has since ceased gambling;

> i)     Given the strong familial support, coupled with the accused’s determination to continue to mend his ways, the accused’s continuation on probation will also allow him to enlist into National Service, which was due on 29 January 2020. A sentence of RT would be disruptive given the accused’s pending conscription (as it was then). In light of the accused’s progress in the last two months (namely from October to December 2019), it was submitted that there would thus be no necessity to require the accused to be in a more structured environment to instil the necessary discipline and self-restraint on him.

## Decision of the court

### Sentencing considerations in relation to a young offender

13     I am mindful of the competing sentencing considerations of deterrence and rehabilitation in determining the appropriate sentence for the accused, a young offender. That said, as a starting point, rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration when deciding on an appropriate sentence for a young offender aged 21 years and below (see _Maurice Mok_ at \[21\] and followed in _Leon Russel Francis_ at \[13\]).

14     However, in the present case, whilst the accused may be a young offender, he is, however, not a first offender, having committed the present offence while he was on probation. I accept that there is no bar for a young offender to be considered for a second probation order, as long as the facts of the case warrant it.

15     Probation places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation and which has as its primary object the swift integration of the offender back to society and provides support to assist him in avoiding the commission of further offences (see _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“_Boaz Koh”_) at \[35\]). Reformative training on the other hand offers the court a middle ground between sending the offender to prison and the desire to rehabilitate a young offender. In other words, reformative training allows the courts to sentence the offender to a rehabilitative programme under a structured environment while avoiding the danger of exposing the young offender to the potentially unsettling influence of an adult prison environment. It presupposes that the offender in question is amenable to rehabilitation within a closed and structured environment such as the RTC (see _Boaz Koh_ at \[38\]).

16     The following factors found at \[57\] in _Boaz Koh_ would be relevant for my deliberation as to whether the accused should be placed on a second sentence of probation (which the prosecution had relied on in their submission):

> (a)     Whether the latest offence in question is serious;

> (b)     Whether the offender’s pattern of offending, seen as a whole, significantly displaces the focus on rehabilitation or at least mandates that greater emphasis be placed on deterrence within an overarching emphasis on rehabilitation. To put it another way, the question is whether the youthful offender’s offending pattern justifies optimism or forebodes an “escalation” from the offender’s previous offences (_PP v Vigneshwaran s/o Ganesan_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 109</span> at \[23\]);

> (c)     Whether there is evidence of genuine remorse and a genuine commitment to repent and turn over a new leaf;

> (d)     Whether there is cause for assurance that the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail have been effectively addressed;

> (e)     Whether there are any countervailing considerations such as the public interest in prevention or deterrence that militate against a fresh order of probation (_PP v Zulkiflee Bin Mohd Iswadi_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 186</span>).

17     With the above sentencing considerations in mind, I now turn to the factual matrix of the present case.

## Whether a second probation order was an appropriate sentence on the facts of the case

18     In my judgement, given the accused’s young age, rehabilitation remained the main sentencing consideration. The current offence, whilst serious, as it carries with it a mandatory imprisonment of up to 7 years, did not however displace the importance of rehabilitation altogether. That said, I am of the view that there was also a ‘significantly heightened need for deterrence’ (see _Boaz Koh_ at \[59\]) for the following reasons:

> a)     The accused’s offending behaviour has escalated in severity, from simple theft[^3] offences committed prior to being placed on probation, to the current offence of trespass with intent to commit theft, where the punishment prescribed is a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 7 years. There was clearly premeditation in that, the accused and his co-accused persons had planned to steal from their schoolmate in a way that each of them had clearly defined roles in ensuring that the illegal enterprise was well executed. He has also been persistently involved in property related offences since 2014[^4] till 2019, and was even sentenced to probation for previous offences of theft committed in 2017 and 2018. He had in fact committed these past offences out of greed and when his gambling debts mounted in 2017 and 2018, he had committed the theft offences to pay off these debts[^5]. This similar pattern of behaviour continued when the accused committed the current offence[^6].

> b)     By virtue of the accused’s repeated offending (by committing the present offence while on probation) as noted above, as well as the fact that he had also re-offended by committing the theft offence in May 2018 while he was undergoing the Guidance Programme[^7] (“GP”), clearly shows the accused’s proclivity towards criminal activities. This ‘pro-criminal attitude’ has been consistent as seen in the Probation Report[^8] when social investigations was first conducted and in the RT Report[^9]. To my mind, it also evinces his ‘lack of consequential thinking and poor problem solving[^10]’, given his reasons for committing the repeated theft offences, which was essentially to settle his gambling debts. Despite having undergone diversionary programmes like the GP and those under the probation order, the accused does not appear to have internalised the lessons learnt[^11] which have resulted in the accused’s continued blatant disregard of the law. Further, the accused would have been aware of the perils of gambling after he was arrested for the previous theft offence, yet he was not forthcoming and had in fact, not informed the PO about his resuming gambling, until he was arrested again for the current offence.

> c)     Notwithstanding the progress made from October to December 2019, the accused’s progress as per the APCC Report during the period of review from August 2018 to August 2019 has been ‘inconsistent’. In fact, even after the commission of the present offence on 28 March 2019, the accused did not show any signs of improvements. He was issued a verbal warning on 23 May 2019 for ‘poor behaviour’ at a community service agency. Despite the warning, he continued to display a lackadaisical attitude and was in fact irregular in his attendance at the community service agency, resulting in his termination as he failed to inform the said agency of his failure to turn up. His reasons for failing to abide by his probation conditions were mere excuses and dismal to say the least, citing the need to report to the police and having to meet his lawyer regarding the current offence, all of which could have been avoided, had he not even committed the current offence in the first place! His school attendance was also irregular and was rated at 56% from July to September 2019[^12]. Further, since the PO’s referral to NAMS to attend counselling for his gambling addiction in April 2019, he had only attended four sessions and had in fact defaulted on his counselling sessions from August to October 2019. Even if it was accepted that the counsellor was not available during the period, it would only be sensible if alternative arrangements could have been made with the counsellor to attend counselling on a mutually convenient date. However, no such attempts were made. Additionally, the accused also cited attending court mentions as a reason for his failure to attend counselling, which to my mind, were again feeble excuses calculated to justify his lack of sincere commitment in wanting to curb an unhealthy habit, which was the root cause of his offending behaviour.

> d)     Whilst the accused’s parents are supportive of the accused towards his rehabilitation, they were however, ineffective in their supervision in ensuring that the accused abided by the conditions under the probation order. For example, they shared with the PO that the accused ‘possessed a poor attitude towards school’ and was ‘not receptive’ to their advice[^13]. Neither were they able to ensure that the accused performed his community service regularly or prevent him from being terminated from a particular community service agency. Their ineffectiveness would appear to be largely due to the distant relationship between him and his family members. The accused did not seek their advice when faced with problems and neither did he reveal much to them about his peers and activities. They were only aware of his gambling issues and the commission of the offences after his arrest. In fact, he would even ‘argue’ with his parents at times when he breached his time curfew. He would also not spend time with his family on weekends, preferring to spend time with his peers instead[^14].

> e)     I also found the accused lacking in genuine remorse where he minimised his role in the current offence, stating that he had only distracted the victim while the theft took place and ‘did not think he would be involved’. This was despite having committed similar offences previously[^15]. Furthermore, in his RT Report, he had even denied committing any theft offences when he was his secondary school as well as the offence committed in 2017 (TIC charge). This was despite having been represented by his counsel when the plea of guilt was taken previously (for which he was sentenced to probation) and the theft offences committed in secondary school as highlighted in the Probation Report were never disputed previously either. I therefore had serious doubts on whether the accused was truly contrite for committing the current offence as well as all the past theft offences.

## Whether signs of the accused’s reform justifies a second probation order

19     It must be noted that the accused was sentenced to 15-month probation order, which commenced on 13 August 2018 and expired on 12 November 2019. As seen above, the accused’s progress was inconsistent during a substantial period of the probation order and even as recent as 21 October 2019 (as it was then), when the Progress Report was presented, the PO did not recommend probation to continue. This would have been less than a month before the probation order expires on 12 November 2019. This would have given the accused ample opportunities to work on his conduct and fulfil his obligations under the probation order (even after committing the current offence) but he failed to do so. It appeared that only concerted efforts were made by the accused from October to December 2019, ‘to avoid what may potentially be a heavier sentence’ (see _Boaz Koh_ at \[67\]) as by this time, he faced the real prospect of being sentenced to RT given that probation was not recommended (as per the Progress Report). I therefore found the accused’s apparent improvements in his conduct of ‘questionable probative value’ and had concerns if such improvements were sustainable over time.

20     Whilst the courts are not precluded from considering a second probation order, for a young offender who has committed previous similar offences for which he was sentenced to probation, and had in fact, committed the second offence while on probation (see _PP v Pik June Hao Gary_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 181</span>, cited by defence counsel), I am of the view that each case has to be decided on its own specific facts and circumstances.

21     Whilst the accused has realised the error of his ways and is now prepared to make changes and not repeat his mistakes, I am confident that rehabilitation can still take place within a structured environment, which would only benefit the accused to instil some discipline to ensure that he is on the right path towards effective rehabilitation. Given the deep concerns highlighted above, I am of the view that deterrence – both general and specific – would be necessary to ensure that the accused as well as like-minded probationers take their probation orders seriously and not re-offend in future. I therefore determined that a sentence of reformative training at level 2 intensity of rehabiliatiton (as recommended in the RT Report), would thus be the most appropriate sentence as it strikes the balance between the twin goals of rehabilitation and deterrence.

_The accused was sentenced to undergo reformative training for a minimum of 12 months’ detention in a reformative training centre._
