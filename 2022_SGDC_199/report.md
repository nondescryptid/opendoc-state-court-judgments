### District Judge Brenda Chua:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Huang Xiaoyue, claimed trial to two charges:

> **DCN-900253-2021** **(“1st Charge”)**

> You…are charged that you, on 17 September 2019, at about 4 pm, at “Four Seasons Spa”, an establishment for massage located at 19 Tanglin Road, #B1-05 Tanglin Shopping Centre, Singapore, did carry on the business of providing massage services without having a licence issued under the Massage Establishments Act 2017 (Act 45 of 2017) (“MEA”), or an exemption under Section 32 of the MEA, and you have thereby contravened Section 5(1) of the MEA.

> And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were convicted on 17 September 2019, at or before 10.11 am, in District Court No. 35, _vide_ MCN-902502-2018, for an offence under Section 5(1) punishable under Section 5(4)(a) of the MEA, and sentenced to a fine of $7,000, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date, and you are thereby a repeat offender under Section 5(5)(a)(i) of the MEA, and have committed an offence punishable under Section 5(4)(b) of the MEA.

> **DCN-900252-2021** (“**2**nd**Charge**”)

> You…are charged that you, on 9 December 2019, at about 3.35 pm, at “Four Seasons Spa”, an establishment for massage located at 19 Tanglin Road, #B1-05 Tanglin Shopping Centre, Singapore, did carry on the business of providing massage services without having a licence issued under the Massage Establishments Act 2017 (Act 45 of 2017) (“MEA”), or an exemption under Section 32 of the MEA, and you have thereby contravened Section 5(1) of the MEA.

> And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were convicted on 17 September 2019, in District Court No. 35, _vide_ MCN-902502-2018, for an offence under Section 5(1) punishable under Section 5(4)(a) of the MEA, and sentenced to a fine of $7,000, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date, and you are thereby a repeat offender under Section 5(5)(a)(i) of the MEA, and have committed an offence punishable under Section 5(4)(b) of the MEA.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted the accused on the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge. I sentenced the accused to a total imprisonment term of 24 weeks.

3       The accused has appealed against the convictions and the sentences imposed. The sentences have been stayed pending appeal. I set out the reasons for my decision here.

## Facts

4       The Statement of Agreed Facts recorded the accused as a 26-year-old female Chinese national. The accused was the sole shareholder and director of SPA EMPIRE PRIVATE LIMITED, which operated Four Seasons Spa, a massage establishment located at 19 Tanglin Road, #B1-05 Tanglin Shopping Centre. It was undisputed that the accused was in the business of providing _massage services_ \[emphasis in italics\].

5       It was also undisputed that on 17 September 2019 and 9 December 2019, Four Seasons Spa did not have a licence issued under the Massage Establishments Act 2017 (No. 45 of 2017) (“the MEA”). Although Four Seasons Spa was an exempted massage establishment, _it had rooms that allowed massage services to be administered in private_ \[emphasis in italics\]. This was in contravention of Order 6(1)(c) of the Massage Establishments (Exemption) Order 2018 (“the exemption order”). Hence, Four Seasons Spa did not have an exemption under section 32 of the MEA.

## The prosecution’s case

6       The prosecution called the following witnesses:

7       In the Prosecution’s Opening Address, the prosecution submitted that the accused carried on the business of providing massage services without a licence issued under the MEA or an exemption under section 32 of the MEA. Specifically, Four Seasons Spa was operating on 17 September 2019 and 9 December 2019 when customers visited it and when police officers conducted checks.

8       The prosecution’s case was that the offences are strict liability offences and that no defence has been established because the accused did not exercise reasonable care in operating Four Seasons Spa.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

### The prosecution witnesses’ overall evidence with regard to the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge

9       It was undisputed by the parties in the Statement of Agreed Facts, and the prosecution demonstrated, that Four Seasons Spa breached the conditions of its MEA exemption by having rooms on the premises. Senior Staff Sergeant Chin Teng Jin (PW6) confirmed that on 17 September 2019, Four Seasons Spa had rooms with doors, which were not allowed under the conditions of its exempted massage establishment licence. Once the conditions of its licence were breached, Four Seasons Spa would be operating without a licence. Accordingly, Four Seasons Spa was no longer allowed to operate and the staff were told to lock the establishment on 17 September 2019.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Similarly, Senior Staff Sergeant Lim Chin Leng, Willie (PW7) (“SSS Lim”) testified that on 9 December 2019, Four Seasons Spa had rooms along its walkway.[^3]

10     The prosecution tendered photographs showing partitions and rooms with doors at Four Seasons Spa taken on 17 September 2019 (Exhibit P1.7) and 9 December 2019 (Exhibit P5.8).

### The prosecution witnesses’ evidence with regard to the 1st Charge

11     The prosecution also demonstrated that Four Seasons Spa was operating and providing massage services, even though it did not have the requisite licence or exemption to do so. Lin Zhenjia Harvard (PW2), who patronised Four Seasons Spa on 17 September 2019, testified that there was no doubt that Four Seasons Spa was operating as he saw people coming in and out of Four Seasons Spa and there were masseuses sitting around. He paid for a massage and was brought to a room.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) Ang Zhihao (PW4), who patronised Four Seasons Spa on 17 September 2019, testified that Four Seasons Spa was operating as there was a sign stating that it was open and that there was a receptionist at the establishment’s entrance.[^5]

12     Neo Peng Long (PW3), who also patronised Four Seasons Spa on 17 September 2019, testified that Four Seasons Spa was operating and sexual services were offered. He paid for a massage and was brought into a room where he was asked to change into shorts. Subsequently, a masseuse came and massaged his back while he was lying down on the bed. During the massage, the masseuse hinted of a hand job using a gesture of a hand stroke, and he rejected it. He testified that the masseuse pulled down his shorts and started stroking and massaging his groin area. In his view, the stroking of the groin was not part of the massage service that he paid for.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

### The prosecution witnesses’ evidence with regard to the 2nd Charge

13     SSS Lim testified that he interviewed male customers on 9 December 2019 who said that the masseuses offered sexual services to them which they rejected due to the price. This is consistent with the testimony of Chong Yean Zhang (PW9) who patronised Four Seasons Spa on 9 December 2019. He said that Four Seasons Spa was operating as the sign showed that it was open, there were people working inside and he asked how much they charged for a massage. He also testified that the masseuse offered him a blow job or hand job towards the end of the massage which he declined as it was too expensive, after which the masseuse walked away and the massage ended.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

## Submission of no case to answer

14     The defence did not make a submission of no case to answer. I was satisfied that the prosecution established a _prima facie_ case on the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge. The accused was therefore called to make her defence.

## The defence’s case

15     The defence called the following witnesses:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.3838143409699%"><col width="33.7399583457304%"><col width="30.9729247247843%"><col width="24.9033025885153%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/N</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Witness</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Role</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Marking</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Huang Xiaoyue</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DW1</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Senior Staff Sergeant Mohammad Khairunnizham bin Abdul Rahim</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Police officer at Four Seasons Spa on 17 September 2019 (1<sup>st</sup> Charge)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DW2</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

16     The defence’s case was that being the owner of Four Seasons Spa did not make the accused culpable for the alleged offences. The accused was the director of Four Seasons Spa, whilst daily operations were managed by the staff, including manning the cash register, keeping books and running the place. The accused would drop in as and when her tuition schedule permitted and oversee the business and ensure everything was in order.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

17     The defence highlighted that the accused instructed her staff not to operate Four Seasons Spa, and that she was unaware of the massage services and sexual services which occurred.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) The essence of the defence was that the accused had no intention to run foul of section 5(1) of the MEA as the acts of the employees at Four Seasons Spa were done without her knowledge and consent. She was not present on those days.[^10] The offence is one of strict liability, and the defence’s case is that the accused exercised reasonable care to ensure that her employees did not offer the massage services during the course of their employment.[^11]

### The defence witnesses’ overall evidence with regard to the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge

18     The accused testified that although she was the owner of Four Seasons Spa, she did not go to Four Seasons Spa daily. The accused admitted that she trusted Wu Wenying, a masseuse who worked at Four Seasons Spa, too much, and handed her a set of keys to Four Seasons Spa, while the accused held the other set of keys. Also, Wu Wenying was in charge of the record book which contained the number of customers and cash received for the day, although the accused would take charge of the record book at times. The accused testified that Wu Wenying might have secretly opened Four Seasons Spa without telling the accused about it.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

19     In addition, the accused testified that the onus was on her to comply with the licence conditions. She may have taken a brief look at the licence conditions but she could not remember the details.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) Notably, the accused admitted that she was “careless” in running Four Seasons Spa. Although she informed her staff not to operate Four Seasons Spa, she left it to her staff and it was – in the accused’s words – her “oversight” and “negligence”. The accused also admitted that she did not do sufficient checks.[^14]

### The defence witnesses’ evidence with regard to the 1st Charge

20     Senior Staff Sergeant Mohammad Khairunnizham bin Abdul Rahim (DW2) testified that on 17 September 2019[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15):

> (a)     Four Seasons Spa was open as it was not locked and there were customers and masseuses;

> (b)     Four Seasons Spa had an exempted massage establishment licence which meant that it must not have rooms or partitions. It breached the conditions of the licence by having rooms or partitions; and

> (c)     Four Seasons Spa was operating without a valid licence or an exemption under the MEA.

### The defence witnesses’ evidence with regard to the 2nd Charge

21     The accused testified that when she was in China at the material time, she did not take steps to ensure that Four Seasons Spa was not operating – she did not check, it could not be helped and no one helped her to check. Also, the accused did not know whether the spa was operating.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

## The court’s decision

### Finding on the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge

22     The massage establishment licence screening for SPA EMPIRE PRIVATE LIMITED dated 31 March 2022 showed that the licence was granted on 12 September 2018 for the establishment “4 SEASONS SPA”, the licensee’s name was “Huang Xiaoyue” and the licence type was “Exempted ME”.

23     Section 5(1) of the MEA states that “\[a\] person must not carry on the business of providing massage services in an establishment for massage unless the person is authorised to do so at those premises by a licence under this Act.” In addition, section 32 of the MEA states that “\[t\[he Minister may, by order in the _Gazette_, exempt any premises or class of premises from all or any of the provisions of this Act, either generally or in a particular case and subject to such conditions as the Minister may impose.”

24     In paragraph 3 of a Notification to Operate an Exempted Massage Establishment dated 13 September 2018 from the Singapore Police Force to the accused relating to an establishment named as “4 Seasons Spa”, the accused was “reminded to comply with all the exemption conditions under the Massage Establishments (Exemption) Order 2018” and “\[f\]ailure to comply with any of the exemption conditions may result in you being prosecuted for an offence of operating an unlicensed massage establishment under the Massage Establishments Act 2017”.

25     In this regard, Order 6(1)(c) of the exemption order states as follows:

> “**Premises at which massage is provided in full public view**

> **6.**\-(1)    Subject to sub-paragraph (1A), any premises is exempt from the provisions of the Act if all the following conditions are satisfied:

>> …

>> (c)    there are no rooms, partitions, cubicles, or other form of furniture in the premises that allow massage services to be administered in private;”

26     On the evidence given at the trial and the photographs tendered, I was satisfied that Four Seasons Spa did not meet the condition that “there are no rooms, partitions, cubicles, or other form of furniture in the premises that allow massage services to be administered in private”. Accordingly, Four Seasons Spa was not exempted from the MEA’s provisions.

27     In light of the consistent and strong evidence, I was satisfied that Four Seasons Spa operated and provided massage services on 17 September 2019 and 9 December 2019, which were the dates specified in the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge respectively. As Four Seasons Spa was not licensed to provide massage services on these dates, it contravened section 5(1) of the MEA.

28     Lastly, turning to the accused’s evidence, I noted the accused’s admission that she was careless in running Four Seasons Spa and that it was her oversight in leaving it to her staff to run Four Seasons Spa. I also noted the accused’s admission that she did not do sufficient checks on Four Seasons Spa to ensure that it was not operating. As such, I found that the accused did not exercise reasonable care.

29     I was therefore satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the accused guilty and convicted the accused of the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge.

## Sentencing

### The prosecution’s submission on sentence

30     The prosecution sought a global imprisonment term of 26 weeks, comprising an imprisonment term of 12 weeks for the 1st Charge and an imprisonment term of 14 weeks for the 2nd Charge. The prosecution proposed using Band 3 of the following sentencing framework[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17):

31     The prosecution submitted these reasons for the proposed global imprisonment term sought[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18):

> (a)     Vice activities were detected at Four Seasons Spa;

> (b)     The accused was traced for vice-related offences. The facts pertaining to her previous conviction involved “handjob” service offered at Four Seasons Spa (Exhibit A10-5);

> (c)     The accused’s sentence should be higher than the sentence imposed in _Public Prosecutor v Ong Han Seng & Choo Kon Ying_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 14</span> (“_Ong Han Seng_”) as the accused claimed trial. In _Ong Han Seng_, the repeat offender, Ong Han Seng (“_Ong_”), pleaded guilty and was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 10 weeks for a charge under section 5(1) punishable under section 5(4)(b) of the MEA; and

> (d)     Aggravating factors warranted an uplift in sentence. The accused knew that Four Seasons Spa was operating without a valid licence. There was a greater need for specific deterrence in respect of the 2nd Charge, given the accused’s recalcitrance after the police operation in respect of the 1st Charge. She continued to operate Four Seasons Spa “without a valid licence after that”[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19).

### Mitigation

32     The defence sought a high fine by seeking to distinguish _Ong Han Seng_ from the present case, and stated that the accused’s right to claim trial ought not to be factored against her[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20). The defence submitted these reasons:

> (a)     The accused’s only fault was that she was careless. She was not present at Four Seasons Spa on the two days. The accused left day-to-day spa operations to her employee, and her trust was “misplaced”. The accused was “paying a heavy price for not exercising reasonable care in overseeing the business”. Her lack of due diligence could also be attributed to the fact that the accused was “actively in conjunction” with Chinese nationals considering investing in a tuition centre[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21);

> (b)     Unlike a case where an offender was present daily at a massage establishment with sexual paraphernalia which clearly indicated that the management and staff worked hand in hand in providing sexual activity, the accused visited Four Seasons Spa “once a week or so” and no lubricating gel and condoms were found.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) It was clear that the acts were carried out “behind her back” and the provision of vice activity was “a private deal” between the masseuses and customers. The absence of sexual paraphernalia also indicated that Four Seasons Spa was not a front for vice activity[^23];

> (c)     The duration of the unlicensed business was in “two instance” and “negligible”. In addition, Four Seasons Spa was not located close to popular public amenities[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24); and

> (d)     The accused should be given a sentence similar to that in _Public Prosecutor v Zhang Chunhua_ where Zhang Chunhua (“Zhang”) was fined $8,000 in 2018 for an offence under section 5(1) punishable under section 5(4)(b) of the MEA. Zhang was a repeat offender who was previously convicted for a similar offence under the Massage Establishments Act (Chapter 173, 2013 Revised Edition).[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

### The court’s decision on sentence

### Sentences for the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge

33     In my decision on sentence, I referred to the MEA’s objectives. The following extracts from the Second Reading speech dated 6 November 2017 for the Massage Establishments Bill were instructive:

> “The Massage Establishments Act regulates massage establishments, by licensing the operators and imposing conditions on their activities. The aim is to prevent massage establishments from being used for vice activities, or causing law and order problems.

> MHA has reviewed the massage establishment regulatory regime to ensure that it remains effective in the changing landscape. Under the enhanced regime, we will take tougher action against unlicensed massage establishments.

> …The significantly higher fines and the inclusion of imprisonment as a punishment will be a stronger deterrent.

> …The enhanced penalties will ensure that unlicensed massage establishment operators face serious consequences upon conviction.

> …The Bill allows tougher action to be taken against unlicensed operators and errant licensees, who damage the image of the massage industry.”

34     With the proliferation of vice-related activities in unlicensed massage establishments in Singapore, it is in the public interest to take a strong stance against offenders, especially repeat offenders. Bearing in mind the MEA’s legislative objectives, there is a need for general deterrence in respect of such offences.

35     I did not consider the defence’s reliance on the 2018 unreported decision of _Public Prosecutor v Zhang Chunhua_ persuasive. Unreported “decisions often lack sufficient particulars to paint the entire factual landscape required to appreciate the precise sentences imposed. The lack of reasoned grounds also greatly diminishes the precedential value of these decisions”: _Abdul Aziz bin Mohamed Hanib v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 101</span> at \[173\]. I noted also that this unreported decision had different legislative particulars involving preceding legislation and the MEA.

36     I did not adopt the prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework. In this, I was guided by _Public Prosecutor v Sindok Trading Pte Ltd (now known as BSS Global Pte Ltd) and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 52</span> (at \[29\]) which stated that “benchmarks should generally be left to the appellate court”. Instead, I found the sentencing factors in _Ong Han Seng_ relevant_._ These were mentioned by both the prosecution and the defence. The facts pertaining to Ong in _Ong Han Seng_ were also similar to the present case, as the comparison below showed:

37     For offence-specific factors going towards harm, there were vice activities involving sexual services at Four Seasons Spa. For the 1st Charge, Neo Peng Long (PW3) testified that on 17 September 2019, the masseuse at Four Seasons Spa pulled down his shorts and started stroking and massaging his groin area. For the 2nd Charge, Chong Yean Zhang (PW9) testified that on 9 December 2019, the masseuse at Four Seasons Spa offered him a blow job or hand job towards the end of the massage.

38     The prosecution and the defence did not submit that disamenities were caused. While there are residential units near Four Seasons Spa, which is located at Tanglin Shopping Centre in the central shopping district at Orchard Road near hotels and commercial units, there was no evidence that the vice activities caused law and order problems.

39     As for the duration of operation in contravention of the MEA, the prosecution submitted that the accused continued to operate Four Seasons Spa without a valid licence after 17 September 2019, while the defence submitted that it was only for two days. The exact duration was not clearly determined, and I therefore used the shorter two-day duration. The prosecution did not object to this.

40     For offence-specific factors going towards culpability, vice activity was repeatedly detected at Four Seasons Spa. The accused took no remedial action after the first 2019 incident, which was 17 September 2019. On 9 December 2019, there was again violation of the same MEA provisions. The accused’s conduct was egregious, given the earlier round of police checks and enforcement. In addition, the accused committed the offence in the 1st Charge on the same day that she was convicted for her previous offence. This showed her disregard for the law. There was a need for specific deterrence.

41     The accused’s approach to running Four Seasons Spa was indifferent, supported by her admissions that she was careless and negligent, did not do sufficient checks and left the operation of Four Seasons Spa to her staff. Regarding the points on the accused’s weekly visits and the absence of sexual paraphernalia, it was the accused’s responsibility to comply with the MEA’s requirements. The accused’s weekly visits to Four Seasons Spa were ineffectual. Further, regardless of the presence or absence of sexual paraphernalia, it was established that vice activity was carried out at Four Seasons Spa.

42     No offender-specific mitigating factors were relevant here. On offender-specific aggravating factors, the accused was unrepentant and wanted to devolve her responsibility as the named licensee of Four Seasons Spa. In the accused’s words: “The only thing that I will admit to is that I have been too careless, and I have been too trusting.”[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) In addition to the accused’s lack of remorse, she had a relevant antecedent.

43     Having considered the facts of the case, the prosecution’s submission on sentence and the defence’s submission on mitigation, I found that the custodial threshold was crossed. I imposed an imprisonment term of 12 weeks for the 1st Charge and an imprisonment term of 12 weeks for the 2nd Charge. I did not view the sentences as excessive. I considered the one-transaction rule and the totality principle in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>. The offences were committed on separate occasions and were unrelated. I ordered the imprisonment terms imposed on the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge to run consecutively.

## Conclusion

44     The accused was therefore convicted on the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge. The accused was sentenced to a total imprisonment term of 24 weeks.

45     The accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
