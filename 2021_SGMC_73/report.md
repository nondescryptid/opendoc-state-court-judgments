## PROSECUTION’S CASE

2       To prove its case against the AP, the Prosecution called 3 witnesses and tendered a list of exhibits as follows:

![]([2021] SGMC 0073_Image/[2021] SGMC 0073_image1.png)

![]([2021] SGMC 0073_Image/[2021] SGMC 0073_image2.png)

## CLOSE OF THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

3       At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that there was some evidence not inherently incredible which satisfied each and every element of the 3 charges preferred against the AP. Accordingly, I administered the standard allocution to the AP who elected to give evidence in his own defence. I rejected the AP’s applications to issue process for compelling the attendance of the Commissioner of Police and the Prime Minister as witnesses on the AP’s alleged World Economic Forum (WEF) 2021 plot[^7] as I took the view that the applications were frivolous or vexatious as the evidence of the aforesaid 2 witnesses were irrelevant to the 3 charges preferred against the AP pursuant to section 230(1)(r) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

## WHETHER THE PROSECUTION HAS ESTABLISHED ITS CASE AGAINST THE AP

4       I accepted the prosecution submissions that there is overwhelming evidence in support of the 3 charges preferred against the AP, including the eyewitness testimony of PW2 and the video footage from her body-worn camera (“the BWC footage[^8]”) for the following reasons:

(a)     **S 16(2) POA charge in MAC-906299-2021**

5       The principles governing the offence under s 16(2) of the POA are well established[^9] and are as follows:

> (a)     The offence is one of strict liability;

> (b)     It has two elements: (i) The accused has taken part in a public assembly; and (ii) No permit has been granted in respect of that assembly.

6       As submitted by the prosecution, both the above elements were largely undisputed at trial by the AP, and are clearly made out. The AP had taken part in a “public assembly”[^10], by demonstrating opposition to the actions of various groups, including the US and Singapore governments, on 15 July 2021 at about 5.30 pm in front of the Embassy of the United States. This was clearly captured in the BWC footage. To do so, he used the placards which he had prepared in advance[^11]. He also publicised his plan to protest outside the US embassy that evening from 5 pm onwards by sending an email in advance to various authorities and media outlets on 15 July 2021 at 3.54 pm (“**the Email**”)[^12]. Taking the definitions of “public assembly” and “assembly”[^13], a demonstration against the actions of any person or any government by a single person in a public place is a “public assembly” for the purposes of the offence under s 16(2)(a) of the POA.

7       It was also undisputed that no permit had been granted for the protest[^14]. In fact, no application was made by the AP for a permit on this occasion unlike in a previous occasion in 2016 when he did make an application which was rejected.[^15]This highlights that the AP clearly knew that he had to obtain a permit in order to engage in a protest or public assembly and intentionally failed to do so.

## (b)    S 37 POA charge in MAC-907325-2021

8       As submitted by the prosecution, the s 37 POA charge is also made out as the AP had flatly refused to comply with a move on direction (MOD) which was given to him by PW2 after she notified him that he was committing an offence under s 16 of the POA and advised him to leave the area. These interactions are captured in the BWC footage and the transcript of the said footage.[^16] The legal provisions indicate that PW2 was legally entitled to give the MOD to the AP, although he took issue with her decision to do so as explained by the prosecution as follows:

> (a)     S 35(1)(d) read with s 36(1) of the POA provide that a MOD may be given to a person by a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant if that officer reasonably suspects that the person’s behaviour “show that he is just about to commit an offence or has just committed or is committing an offence”. In this case, PW2 was empowered to give the AP a MOD as he was committing an offence under s 16 of the POA at the material time, as she had informed him.

> (b)     S 36(2)(b) of the POA states that a MOD shall not be given “unless it is reasonably necessary in the interests of … public order”. Based on PW2’s testimony, it is evident that this condition was met based on the following considerations:

>> (i)       The AP’s actions in protesting loudly was causing a disturbance and disrupting public order at a public place, where other members of the public were present. As the BWC footage shows, a crowd of onlookers had already started to gather along Napier Road in the short time before the police officers arrived at the scene at about 5.30pm.

>> (ii)       The location of the protest was also a sensitive location where there were several foreign High Commissions and Embassies. The AP’s actions hence had greater potential to disrupt public order.

> (c)     The requirement in the MOD for the AP to leave the area demarcated in the annexed map for 24 hours was entirely reasonable[^17].

> (d)     The fact that the AP refused to physically accept the document is irrelevant[^18]. As the BWC footage shows, the AP was fully aware of the purpose and import of the MOD.

> (e)     The AP also had no reasonable excuse for his failure to comply with the requirements of the MOD. In fact, as the BWC footage shows, he was obstinate that he would not accept the MOD _even before_ PW2 gave it to him, showing a clear disregard for the authority of the law.

## (c)    S 20 MOA charge in MAC-907326-2021

9       As submitted by the prosecution, the s 20 MOA charge is evidenced by the BWC footage and transcript as well as PW2 ’s testimony. These prove that the AP had behaved in a disorderly manner by repeatedly shouting at the top of his voice despite being asked to calm down by police officers. He started shouting as he was being issued the MOD by PW2 at about 5.40pm on 15 July 2021, and kept shouting throughout his arrest and thereafter as he was escorted to the police car along the walkway along Napier Road. From the BWC footage, there can be no doubt that the AP’s actions in a public place were highly disruptive and amounted to disorderly behaviour.

## AP HAS NO DEFENCE

10     I agreed with the prosecution submissions that the AP proffered no defence to the 3 charges preferred against him during the trial. Instead, he made the following points which are legally irrelevant and without merit:

> (a)     The AP stated that the police officers should have arrived earlier after he sent the Email[^19] and prevented the protest before it started at about 5pm. This is legally irrelevant to the charges against him. In any event, it would not have been reasonable for the police to have reacted immediately to the Email, which contained multiple bizarre and delusional claims and was sent to a large number of organisations and individuals only about one hour before the AP ’s protest. The fact is that the responding officers, led by PW2, reacted promptly and arrived at the scene at about 5.30pm after the first information report13 was lodged at about 5.23pm by an unknown member of the public.

> (b)     The AP repeatedly asserted that PW2 should not have issued the move on direction (MOD) to him and should have arrested him “immediately” when he stated that he would not comply with any directions issued to him. This argument is misconceived as PW2 was fully entitled under the law to issue the MOD to the AP. Further, it was reasonable for PW2 to issue the MOD to the AP to provide him with an opportunity to leave the area so that the public order disruption caused by the AP’s actions could be resolved and de-escalated without an arrest, as PW2 had testified.

11     For all the above reasons, I am satisfied that the prosecution has proved its case in respect of the 3 charges preferred against the AP and I found him guilty and convicted him of the 3 charges.

## SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS

12     The aggravating factors in the present case are clear. There was no real dispute in facts for all the three charges preferred against the AP. He refused to give any mitigation for this court to consider and asked the court to impose the maximum sentences for all 3 proceeded charges. The AP had even threatened to continue with his public protests upon his release from prisons. His continued allegations and rantings of corruption of the entire legal system were his only defence which were merely bare assertions, not rooted in fact or proof of the same. With the evident lack of remorse, and the fact that he is a recalcitrant offender for similar offences (as explained below), the need for specific deterrence and prevention would plainly be the key sentencing considerations at play here. Given the nature of the offences committed, general deterrence would be relevant to ensure that like-minded persons who choose to cause great disturbance and disquiet in public places as well as to wilfully obstruct the lawful exercise of police powers, will be met with stiff sentences.

13     The AP’s long string of similar and related antecedents, all accrued since 2016 had been summarised by the prosecution in a table below (emphasis in bold mine):

![]([2021] SGMC 0073_Image/[2021] SGMC 0073_image3.png)

![]([2021] SGMC 0073_Image/[2021] SGMC 0073_image4.png)

14     I agree with the prosecution that from the AP’s aforesaid antecedents, specific deterrence is a dominant sentencing consideration in the present case as he has not been deterred despite receiving substantial terms of imprisonment for similar offences. This is the 8th occasion that the AP is being convicted of similar offences within a short span of less than five years. He has failed to learn from past punishments and the present offences had occurred soon after his last prison release, during the period of remission of his previous sentence. Prevention is also relevant as the AP is at a high risk of re-offending and escalating in his offending conduct, as testified by PW1 who had stated in his IMH report[^20] that it is likely that the AP will repeat his protesting behaviour if he continues to remain in Singapore, and as his mental state has deteriorated over the years, there is concern that he will escalate in his behaviour in time to come, but he has refused treatment for his delusional disorder which would have contributed to his persecutory beliefs.

15     As submitted by the prosecution, I agreed that a longer custodial term would help to promote the AP’s rehabilitation, which is a relevant consideration given his delusional disorder that contributed to his offending. From PW1’s testimony and the IMH report[^21], it is clear that the AP is not suitable for community rehabilitation due to his high risk of re-offending and non-compliance with any treatment. Therefore, a lengthy custodial sentence provides the best, and perhaps only, chance for the AP to break out of his cycle of repeated offending as it would allow him the opportunity to seek structured treatment in prison. As noted by the Court of Appeal in _PP v Kong Peng Yee_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 295</span> at \[79\], there are cases where rehabilitation and prevention may be “complementary and not conflicting principles”. This principle applies squarely to the present case. As pointed out by the prosecution, effective rehabilitation would still be contingent on the AP taking steps to acknowledge that he has a problem and needs help, and it is hoped that the AP will take the opportunity presented by a longer custodial term to see the prison psychiatrist for treatment while serving his sentence and seek referrals for treatment after serving his sentence.

16     An accused’s conduct at his trial can be regarded as an aggravating factor in circumstances where the accused [^22]:

> (a)     in trying to wriggle his way out of trouble, cast aspersions on a host of persons;

> (b)     blatantly besmirch the repute of prosecution witnesses behind the shield of privilege in judicial proceedings;

> (c)     put forward false stories and on the basis of such false stories contest the charges against him and spun an entire fairy tale in court; and

> (d)     has the audacity to accuse the trial judge of bias and displayed arrogance and disrespect for the trial judge.

17     In the present case, based on the aforesaid circumstances, the AP’s conduct at the trial is to be regarded as an aggravating factor for the following reasons:

> (a)     In trying to wriggle his way out of trouble, the AP had cast aspersions on a host of persons at his trial and blatantly besmirched the repute of prosecution witnesses behind the shield of privilege in judicial proceedings. He baselessly cast aspersions on the Prosecution witnesses, namely PW1 and PW2 by stating that they were lying and incompetent without any evidence. In particular, he repeatedly attacked the integrity and professionalism of PW1 without any basis. The AP also accused PW2 of failing to carry out her duty to prevent crime in not looking at his email sent to the Commissioner of Police on the time and venue of his protest and arriving at the venue before the time to stop his protest, and in wasting public resources in issuing to him a direction under s 36 of the POA when he had told her that he would not comply with the directions. He made 2 frivolous or vexatious applications to this Court to issue process for compelling the attendance of the Commissioner of Police and the Prime Minister as witnesses on his alleged WEF 2021 plot which I had refused.

> (b)     Before giving evidence in his own defence, the AP applied for the prosecution to obtain and release to him for his defence the documents[^23] relating to his email to the US embassy; A summary of WEF 2021 plot; How the AP discovered the WEF 2021 Plot; and his email to the Prime Minister and copied to AGC, police and other ministries and organisations. I allowed the aforesaid application, but later found the aforesaid documents to be totally irrelevant to the AP’s defence as they basically contained his false stories to contest the charges against him and to spun an entire fairy tale in court totally unconnected with the 3 charges faced by the AP at the trial.

> (c)     The AP has persistently stated at his trial that “Singapore’s legal system is totally corrupt” and challenged the court and the prosecution to charge him for contempt. He refused to answer questions put to him by the prosecution and challenged the DPP to answer his questions. He showed exceptional contempt for the proceedings by challenging the impartiality of this Court as well as the Singapore legal system in general. He also challenged the integrity of the DPP and alleged that the Prosecution was lying at various points, again, without any basis.

18     I agreed with the prosecution that the AP’s mental condition does not reduce the weight to be placed on his above conduct at the trial as an aggravating factor. As PW1 had testified, while the AP’s delusional disorder affected his capacity to perceive the irrational nature of his conspiratorial beliefs, it did not affect his capacity to judge the moral and legal rightness of his actions or his ability to exercise self-control. Hence, he is fully responsible for the aggravating and egregious manner in which he conducted himself at trial.

## INDIVIDUAL AND GLOBAL SENTENCES IMPOSED ON THE AP

19     The Prosecution sought the following sentences against the AP:

> (a)     The maximum fine of $5,000 for the s 16(2) POA charge in MAC-906299-2021;

> (b)     The maximum sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the s 37 POA charge in MAC-907325-2021, with the maximum enhancement of 4 days’ imprisonment under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act , and an appropriate custodial sentence for the s 20 MOA charge in MAC-907326-2021, and for both sentences to run concurrently.

20     Taking into account that the AP has 3 antecedents each of the s 37 POA charge and s 20 MOA charge with the last sentence of 20 weeks’ imprisonment and 5 months’ imprisonment on 27 February 2020 and 29 January 2021 respectively, plus 10 antecedents for the s 16(2) POA charge with the last sentence of a fine of $5,000 in default 15 weeks’ imprisonment on 29 January 2021, and in the light of the AP’s aggravating conduct at the trial and the above sentencing considerations on the need for specific and general deterrence, as well as for rehabilitation and prevention, I am of the view that it would be appropriate to impose on the AP the following sentences for each of the 3 proceeded charges:

> (a)     S 16(2) POA charge in MAC-906299-2021: a fine of $5,000 in default 5 months’ imprisonment.

> (b)     S 37 POA charge in MAC-907325-2021: 12 months’ imprisonment with the enhanced sentence of 4 days’ imprisonment under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act.

> (c)     S 20 MOA charge in MAC-907326-2021: 12 months’ imprisonment.

21     As the 3 offences were committed by the AP with proximities in time, place, continuity of action and in purpose or design, and they all form part of a single transaction under the one transaction rule[^24], and as a default term of imprisonment must run consecutively with any other term of imprisonment to which an offender may be sentenced under section 319(1)(b)(v) of the Criminal Procedure Code, I ordered the sentences of 12 months’ imprisonment each in MAC-907325-2021 and MAC-907326-2021 to run concurrently and the enhanced sentence of 4 days’ imprisonment under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act, as well as the default sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment in MAC-906299-2021 to run consecutively, if the AP is unable or refuses to pay the fine of $5,000.

22     Accordingly, I imposed on the AP a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment (backdated to the AP’s date of remand on 16 July 2021), the enhanced sentence of 4 days’ imprisonment and a fine of $5,000 in default 5 months’ imprisonment. In my view, the aforesaid global sentence is not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but entirely appropriate based on the facts and circumstances of the present case. It should be borne in mind that the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment each in MAC-907325-2021 and MAC-907326-2021 which are to run concurrently meant that the AP would effectively serve only 6 months each per charge and the AP had already been sentenced to 20 weeks’ imprisonment and 5 months’ imprisonment on 27 February 2020 and 29 January 2021 respectively for the same s 37 POA charge and s 20 MOA charge. As for the fine of $5,000 with a default sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment in MAC-906299-2021, the AP had already been sentenced to a fine of $5,000 with a default sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment on 29 January 2021.

[^22]: See _Kow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in Singapore, 2nd edition at \[20.214\] to \[20.242\]._ See also the following cases cited in the prosecution submissions:(a) In _Tuen Huan Rui Mary v PP <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 70</span>_, the High Court held, at \[46\], that “an accused person’s bad behaviour in court can be considered an aggravating factor”. In that case, the accused was found to have shown “an exceptional contempt for the proceedings at the trial bellow”. She badgered the Prosecution witness, challenged the impartiality of the judge and disrupted court proceedings. Her conduct was taken into account as an aggravating factor (at \[47\]– \[48\]).(b) It is also aggravating if the accused makes unfounded allegations against Prosecution witnesses without any basis. In _Lewis Christine v PP <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 131</span> at \[38\]_, the High Court held as follows: “While accused persons are free to prove their innocence, it must be made clear that this does not translate to a liberty to blatantly besmirch the repute of prosecution witnesses behind the shield of privilege in judicial proceedings”.
