10 May 2019

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

This is an appeal against my order that the sum of $50,000/- be forfeited to the State on 8 Apr 19. This sum was the subject-matter of a criminal case in DAC 48396//13 & Ors in relation to one Tan Hock Chye @ Dean (“Dean”), which was heard by me.

2       In this disposal inquiry, the State represented by DPP Jasmin Kaur was seeking for an order to forfeit the $50,000/- to the State. Contesting this application is the claimant Yeo Kong Meow represented by Mr Peter Fernando. Dean was also present. He was self-represented.

3       The State’s application was premised on the ground that the $50,000/- was part of the proceeds of the crime for which Dean was convicted and presently serving sentence. Both Dean and Yeo sought for the $50,000/- to be released to them.

## THE BACKGROUND FACTS

4       The background facts were adequately set out in the Public Prosecutor’s Application, and which was reproduced below -

1.    \[Dean\] (NRIC: XXX) was convicted on 49 counts of cheating on 28 July 2016 in the State Courts and was sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 60 months.

2.    The offences were for his cheating one Lim Chong Beng Ivan (“Ivan”), the managing Director of Worldgate Express Lines Pte Ltd (“Worldgate”), by deceiving him into believing that one Yeo Kong Meow (“Yeo”), of Splendid Service & Supply, wanted referral fees in return for recommending freight business from NTN Bearing Singapore Pte Ltd to Worldgate, and by such deception, dishonestly induced Ivan, to deliver a total sum of S$703,317.20 to the accused. …

3.    In the course of investigations, a search was conducted at Yeo’s residence (Block 122 Paya Lebar Way #XXX) on 15 March 2011. During the search, \[Yeo\] stated the following:

a.    He had closed and withdrawn S$50,000 from a UOB joint account which he had held with the accused.

b.    This S$50,000 belongs to the accused but the accused had told him to safeguard the money for him.

c.    \[Yeo\] then asked his son, Yeo Leng Chwee, to safekeep the same sum of S$50,000, consisting of 50 S$1,000/- notes at Yeo Leng Chwee’s residence (Block 97 Aljunied Crescent #XXX).

4.    In the course of the trial against the offender, \[Yeo\] was called as a Prosecution Witness (PW1). On 21 January 2016, during the trial for \[Dean\], Yeo stated under oath that he had never deposited money into the UOB joint account and that _all_ the money in the UOB joint account belongs to \[Dean\]. …

5.    During the course of investigations, \[Dean\] confirmed the following in his statement to the CPIB, which was admitted by consent into evidence at the trial and marked as **P171**: …

a.    He had deposited some of his proceeds of crime into two joint accounts with PW1 Yeo, _including_ the UOB joint account with Yeo.

b.    He had asked \[Yeo\] to withdraw money from the UOB joint account and to safeguard this for him.

## YEO’S SUBMISSION

5       The grounds for the claimants’ claim were as follows - Worldgate’s director, Ivan had entered into an agreement with Yeo following Yeo’s assistance in boosting Worldgate’s business with NTN Bearing Singapore Pte Ltd (“NTN”). The agreement was to pay commissions to Yeo for his assistance in recommending Worldgate to NTN. Pursuant to the agreement, a large sum of money was paid to Yeo; in total about $703,000/-.

6       Dean was an employee of Worldgate. He and Yeo were good friends. At the time, Dean was in severe financial debt. Following a discussion between them, Yeo agreed to give Dean a portion of the commissions that Worldgate paid to him. This was to help Dean with his debt problem. Dean would collect the cheques for the commissions from Worldgate. He would encash the cheques, and then gave the money to Yeo. Yeo would then give Dean a portion of the money. The $50,000/- was part of the commissions.

7       Mr Fernando argued that based on his reading of the Grounds of Decision (“GD”) for the criminal case against Dean, I did not make a finding that the commission agreement was a sham and/or unlawful. He pointed out that Dean’s conviction was based on the fact that he had not revealed to Ivan, his boss at Worldgate, that he was receiving part of Yeo’s commissions. That was the deception practised on Ivan by Dean. Therefore, as the agreement to pay commissions to Yeo was genuine and legitimate, Yeo was therefore entitled to the $50,000/-.

## DPP’S SUBMISSION

8       DPP Jasmin Kaur submitted Mr Fernando’s characterisation of the basis of Dean’s conviction was inaccurate. Dean was convicted because Dean had acted dishonestly by concealing from Ivan the fact that the commissions were never intended to be paid to Yeo. The agreement, which on the face of it appeared legitimate, was merely a tool used by Dean to siphon money from his company, Worldgate. As such, the $50,000/- were part of the proceeds of crime and therefore should rightly be forfeited to the State.

## COURT’S FINDINGS

9       Off the bat, by virtue of \[3\], \[4\] and \[5\] above, Yeo’s application would fail. The $50,000/- appeared to belong to Dean, not him. He was not the owner of the $50,000/-. He was merely a custodian of the monies. Dean was the owner of the monies at all times. The question to whom the monies should be released is dependent on the question whether the commission agreement was merely a sham or a genuine agreement.

10     Dean was convicted on 49 counts of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code. The Agreed Facts were that sometime in 2005, soon after Dean joined Worldgate, he had proposed to Ivan that the company pay commissions to Yeo for his help in boosting Worldgate’s business volume with NTN. Ivan accepted his proposal. A meeting was then arranged. The commission agreement was signed pursuant to this.

11     The prosecution’s case was that the commission agreement was a sham devised by Dean to siphon money from Worldgate for his own benefit. Yeo was complicit in the scam. The plan was to make it appear that the commissions were paid to Yeo, and in some instances, to nominees appointed by Yeo. In reality, all the commissions ended up in Dean’s pocket. For his complicity, Yeo was given token sums by Dean for his role in facilitating the scam.

12     Dean’s defence was that the commission agreement was legitimate. As the commissions were paid to Yeo, or his appointed nominees, under a legitimate agreement, they were Yeo’s to use as and how he pleased. However, Yeo had agreed to let him have all the commissions because he (Dean) was facing severe financial difficulties at the time. Yeo had done this altruistic act because they were good friends.

13     The claimants’ characterisation of my findings was grossly inaccurate. If what Mr Fernando said was true, that I had convicted Dean on the basis that he had not revealed to Ivan that he was receiving part of the commissions under a legitimate commission agreement, then the conviction was wrong in law. This was because under these circumstances, there was no offence of cheating. On a side note, Dean had appealed against his conviction and sentence. Both his appeal were dismissed.

14     The gravamen of cheating in the case was that Dean had hatched a plan to siphon money from Worldgate. The commission agreement was a sham devised by Dean to achieve this objective. Yeo was his willing accomplice. Dean persuaded Ivan into agreeing to pay commissions to Yeo for his help to obtain more business from NTN. As such, a commission agreement was signed between the parties. Both Dean and Yeo knew that the commissions were going into Dean’s pocket. Yeo was never intended to receive them. The deception was deceiving Ivan into believing that the commission agreement was a legitimate one when it was not, and in not disclosing to Ivan that the intention was that Dean would receive the commissions. These were the basis for the conviction.

15     I had rejected the defence that Yeo had agreed to give his commissions to Dean because of Dean’s dire financial predicament. Yeo’s evidence in court on this issue were patently inconsistent in material aspects with his statement to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”). The lies were blatant. He was unable to explain the inconsistencies away. His credit was impeached. I also allowed the prosecution’s application to admit Yeo’s CPIB statement (P174) as evidence of any fact stated therein, under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, Cap 97.

16     I had found Dean’s oral testimony on the same point “_… replete with a high degree of internal and external inconsistencies_” (\[54\] of GD). This finding was made after comparing his oral testimony against his two statements to CPIB (P171 and P172). As with Yeo, he was unable to explain the material inconsistencies. At \[58\] of my GD, I made the finding that “_… the defence case theory that Yeo had willingly gifted all his commission payments to \[Dean\] because \[Dean\] was facing financial difficulties was wholly unbelievable and did not raise any reasonable doubt in the Accused’s favour_”.

17     More pertinently. at \[68\] of my GD, I described the whole scheme as follows – “_The manner in which the whole scheme was devised and implemented involved surreptitious and meticulous planning. … The Accused cloaked his scheme to siphon money from Worldgate by duping Ivan into believing that it was a beneficial arrangement for the company ie to increase its business volume with NTN. This was instrumental in the deception_”. By this, I found that the commission agreement was used as a cloak to legitimise Dean’s actual motive behind the scheme, which was to siphon money from Worldgate.

18     The evidence showed that the $50,000/- were part of the commissions paid by Worldgate under the sham arrangement. Dean had, at \[32\] of P171, stated that he had deposited some of the commissions in the UOB joint-account. He had done so because “_… of \[his\] gambling habits as well as to use the accounts for investment purposes_”. Yeo had also unequivocally confirmed that all the monies in the UOB joint-account belonged to Dean (NE, 21 Jan 16, page 74, lines 21-25).

## THE ORDER

19     As such, I ordered that the $50,000/- be forfeited to the State. The forfeiture has been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.
