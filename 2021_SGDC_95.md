### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was charged with several sexual offences. At the time of the commission of the offences, the Accused was 33 years old. He was a teacher in a secondary school. He taught English and Literature.

2       The victim of the Accused’s sexual transgressions was a secondary four student in the same school. She was one of his students. At the time of the commission of the offences by the Accused, the victim was only 15 years old.

3       The Accused pleaded guilty to three charges (the “proceeded charges”). He admitted to another three charges and gave his consent for these charges to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing. In Table A below, I have set out the three proceeded charges and the sentences imposed. In Table B, I have set out the TIC charges.

## Statement of Facts

4       The Accused admitted, without qualification, to the following facts:

>      **Background facts leading up to the offences**

> 3.    In late 2016, the accused began to send text messages to the victim, and they started exchanging messages from there. In early 2017, the accused began communicating with the victim over ‘Snapchat’ (a social media app) and ‘Telegram’ (a messaging app). He also invited her to join the school debate team, which he was in charge of. The victim declined to join.

> 4.    On 17 February 2017 (Friday), while the victim was in school, she received a text message from the accused, asking her if she wanted a drink, and that he could get a Starbucks coffee for her. The victim agreed. In the late afternoon, the accused contacted the victim again to pass her the drink. They then met at the school canteen for the accused to pass her the drink. The accused then asked her if she had time to talk, and the victim agreed. They then sat down and had a chat at the canteen. In this time, the accused asked her, among other things, about her relationship with her ex-boyfriend. They spoke for about 30 minutes, after which the victim left for home.

> 5.    On 22 February 2017 (Wednesday), the accused sent a ‘Telegram’ text message in a chat group consisting of the accused, the victim, and a female classmate of the victim, asking if either of them were free and wanted to meet. The victim replied that she was free, while her classmate did not reply. The accused then told the victim that he would go to her void deck to meet her. Later at about 8.30 pm, the accused arrived at the void deck of the block where the victim resided. The victim met up with him there, where they chatted for about an hour.

>      **Facts relating to the offences**

> 6.    On 25 February 2017 (Saturday), sometime in the late afternoon, the victim received a text message from the accused, where the accused asked if she wanted to meet up with him and go for a ride. The victim agreed. The accused told her not to tell anyone about this.

> 7.    Sometime that evening, the accused drove to the victim’s block to meet her. When the victim arrived at the void deck, the accused complimented her looks. The accused then told her that he wanted to bring her to Block 374 Tampines Street 34 to play cards. He then drove the victim there, with the victim seated in the front passenger seat. She was wearing a long-sleeved button shirt and jeans.

> 8.    Upon arriving at the location, the accused parked at an open carpark in front of a playground. There, the accused suggested that they remain in the car as there was air-conditioning. The victim agreed and began using her mobile phone.

> 9.    At this time, the accused leaned toward the victim and started touching her thigh and neck, while at the same time, asking the victim if she trusted him. At a loss, the victim simply replied that she did. The accused then started to kiss the victim’s neck. He unbuttoned her shirt and reached his hand under her bra, and began to touch her breast. He then also kissed and sucked her breast. The victim did not respond or do anything.

> 10.    The accused then slid his hand into the victim’s jeans and underwear, and inserted his finger into her vagina. The victim felt uncomfortable and immediately grabbed hold of the accused’s wrist. The accused asked her if she liked it, and the victim said no. The accused then removed his hand. The accused then told the victim to imagine that he was her ex-boyfriend.

> 11.    The accused then continued to kiss the victim on her ear and neck. He asked her if she had ever seen a penis before, and asked if she wanted to see his penis. The accused then undid his pants and took out his penis. He took the victim’s hand and placed it on his penis. The victim did not know what to do and closed her eyes. The accused told her to masturbate him. The victim refused and pulled her hand away. The victim then told the accused that she was feeling uncomfortable.

> 12.    The accused then drove the car to the multi-storey carpark at that vicinity and parked at the second highest storey. There, he again leaned in to kiss the victim, but she pulled away from him.

> 13.    The accused then asked if she was hungry, and offered to go to MacDonalds to buy food. They then drove to a nearby MacDonalds, and the accused went to buy food while the victim waited in the car. After eating, the accused drove the victim to a location at Marina Bay area, and brought her to a waterside area where they spent some time.

> 14.    Thereafter, the accused drove the victim home. The accused told the victim not to tell anyone about the incident. Upon reaching home at about 10.30 pm, the victim blocked the accused on the various apps that they had used to communicate.

> 15.    The following Monday on 27 February 2017, in school, the victim shared with a few of her close friends about what happened to her. The school management staff eventually came to know of the incident. As the victim had been not coming to school after 27 February 2017, the school staff visited the victim’s home on 2 March 2017. The victim was brought to lodge a police report at Tampines NPC that afternoon.

## Conviction on the three proceeded charges

5       By kissing the victim’s neck, and touching, kissing and sucking her breast, the Accused has committed an indecent act with a young person. He has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 7(_a_) of the CYPA which is the subject of DAC-935184-2019.

6       By sexually penetrating with his finger the vagina of the victim, who was then under 16 years of age, the Accused has committed an offence under s 376A(1)(_b_) and punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC which is the subject of DAC 935185-2019.

7       By placing the victim’s hand on his penis and asking her to masturbate him, the Accused has committed an indecent act with a young person. He has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 7(_a_) of the CYPA which is the subject of DAC-935186-2019.

8       I found the Accused guilty and convicted him accordingly.

## Antecedent

9       The Accused does not have any criminal antecedent.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

10     The Prosecution sought a global imprisonment term of three years and 12 months.

### Digital penetration under s 376A(1)(b) punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC (“the Digital Penetration offence”)

11     The Prosecution relied on the Court of Appeal’s (“CA”) decision in _Public Prosecutor v BAB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 292</span> (“_BAB_”) in support of its submission on sentence for the Digital Penetration offence.

12     In _BAB_, the respondent had pleaded guilty to the following seven charges:

> (a)     Two charges under s 376A(1)(_b_) punishable under s 376A(3) of the PC for penetration of the victim’s vagina with a dildo while the victim was under 14 years of age;

> (b)     Two charges under s 376A(1)(_b_) punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC for penetration of the victim’s vagina with a dildo while the victim was under 16 years of age

> (c)     Two charges under s 376A(1)(_b_) punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC for digital penetration of the victim’s vagina while the victim was under 16 years of age; and

> (d)     One charge under s 7(_a_) of the CYPA for kissing the victim on the lips and licking her breasts and nipples while the victim was under 14 years of age.

13     In its decision, the CA held, _inter alia_, that for offences punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC, having regard to the gravity of the offence, the applicable sentencing range but not yet considering the elements of proportionality and the mitigating factors, where there was an element of abuse of trust, the appropriate starting point will be an imprisonment term of three years.

> (a)     In respect of the two charges at \[12(c)\] above_, i.e._ offences under s 376A(1)(_b_) punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC for digital penetration of the victim’s vagina while the victim was under 16 years of age, the CA imposed a sentence of three years’ imprisonment on each charge.

> (b)     In respect of the charge at \[12(d)\] above, _i.e._ one charge under s 7(_a_) of the CYPA for kissing the victim on the lips and licking her breasts and nipples while the victim was under 14 years of age, the CA imposed a sentence of one year’s imprisonment.

14     In the present case, I would have to decide on the appropriate sentences on the Accused for the same offences in \[12(c)\] and \[12(d)\] above.

15     The Prosecution submitted that there was a teacher-student relationship between the Accused and the victim. It was in this capacity that the Accused had the opportunity to interact with the victim. The SOF showed that there was a lead up to the commission of the offences. The Prosecution argued that the Accused had deliberately been trying to initiate contact with the victim when he had no business to do so. He was not her teacher at that time, but nonetheless the Accused initiated private contact with the victim on a few occasions. The Accused’s actions were premeditated. He had sought out the victim over time and engineered the opportunity to sexually exploit the victim. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s actions in the commission of the offences represented a grievous abuse of trust as a teacher. The sentencing guidelines enunciated in _BAB_ was thus applicable in the present case.

16     The Prosecution highlighted the psychological harm suffered by the victim. The victim had informed that the Accused’s actions had made her feel that she could not trust people that she had just met, and she felt that she should not go to school in order to avoid the Accused. She felt scared when she saw people waiting at the void deck and there were times where she would have flashbacks of the incident.

17     After considering these factors and after giving due weight to the Accused’s plea of guilt, the Prosecution applied _BAB’s_ sentencing guidelines and took the position that an imprisonment term of three years would be an appropriate sentence for the Digital Penetration offence.

### Offence of committing an indecent act on a young person under s 7(a) of the CYPA (“the CYPA offences”)

18     For the CYPA offences, the Prosecution relied on Chief Justice Menon’s decision from a Magistrate’s Appeal in _AQW v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 150</span> (“_AQW_”) for its sentencing position. In _AQW_, the offender had pleaded guilty to:

> (a)     One charge under s 376A(1)(_c_) punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC for performing fellatio on a minor who was a few weeks shy of his 15th birthday; and

> (b)     Two charges under s 7(_a_) of the CYPA for masturbating the said minor.

19     The District Judge sentenced the offender to 15 months’ imprisonment for the s 376(1)(_c_) PC offence and ten months’ imprisonment for each of the two offences under s 7(_a_) of the CYPA. The imprisonment terms for the s 376(1)(_c_) PC offence and one of the s 7(_a_) CYPA offences were ordered to run consecutively, making an aggregate sentence of 25 months’ imprisonment. The offender appealed against the sentence. Menon CJ allowed the appeal. The sentence for the s 376A(1)(_c_) PC offence was reduced to ten months’ imprisonment and the sentences for each of the s 7(_a_) CYPA offences were reduced to six months’ imprisonment. The two sentences for the s 7(_a_) CYPA offences were ordered to run consecutively for an aggregate sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment.

20     In _AQW_, Menon CJ held, _inter alia_, that for offences punishable under s 7 of the CYPA, a sentence of between six and eight months’ imprisonment would be appropriate where (a) the sexual act that took place between the offender and the minor involved touching of naked genitalia, regardless of whose genitalia it was, (b) the minor was 14 years old or above, and does not appear to be particularly vulnerable, (c) the offender did not coerce or pressure the minor into participating in the sexual act, and (d) there was no element of abuse of trust.

21     In the present case, the Prosecution argued that there was an element of abuse of trust. This is an aggravating factor, and this particular aggravating factor was absent in _AQW_. The Prosecution thus argued that the presence of the element of abuse of trust called out for an uplift of the imprisonment from the said sentencing benchmark. The Prosecution submitted for an uplift of four months’ imprisonment. In conclusion, the Prosecution sought a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for each count of the CYPA offences.

### Application of s 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”)

22     The Prosecution submitted that the sentence of three years’ imprisonment for the Digital Penetration offence should run consecutively with one count of the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for one of the two CYPA offences. The total sentence sought by the Prosecution would be three years and 12 months’ imprisonment.

## Defence’s mitigation plea and submissions on sentence

### Mitigation plea

23     In mitigation, the Defence argued that the Accused had co-operated with the Police at the investigation stage and had admitted to his wrong doings when he was questioned by the Police. The Defence further argued that the Accused’s admission to the commission of the offences and his plea of guilt was a clear sign of his remorse. As such, his remorse ought to be given weight as a mitigating factor and merit a reduction in the sentence. The Defence referred to excerpts from the following two case authorities in support of its argument:

> (a)      _PP v Siew Boon Loong_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 611</span> at \[21\]:

>> 21    … … To my mind, there is, however, an even greater public interest in encouraging a guilty person to come forward to disclose the facts of the offence that he has committed, and to confess that he is guilty of that offence. Thus put, giving significant weight to an early plea of guilt, or for that matter, any other indicators of remorse and repentance, is entirely consistent with the public interest.

> (b)      _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> at \[77\]:

>> 77    I summarise. A plea of guilt can be taken into consideration in mitigation when it is motivated by genuine remorse, contriteness or regret and/or a desire to facilitate the administration of justice. The mitigating effect should also be compatible with the sentencing purpose(s) and principles the sentencing judge is seeking to achieve and observe through the sentence. A late plea of guilt may sometimes also be accorded some weight depending on the continuum of relevant circumstances. This approach fortuitously also produces tangible and utilitarian benefits. By undertaking a holistic assessment of the totality of the accused’s conduct up to and including the plea of guilt, the remorse-based approach encourages accused persons to facilitate, at an early stage, the course of justice not only by short-circuiting the trial process but crucially also by helpfully participating in the investigations.

24     The Defence highlighted that the Accused’s plea of guilt has saved precious time and resources for the Court and the Prosecution. The victim was also saved from having to recount the details of her experience.

25     The Defence informed that the Accused has learnt a hard and bitter lesson and deeply regretted his actions. The Accused has realised that he had failed to draw boundaries with the victim and accepted that the manner he had conducted himself was extremely inappropriate and unacceptable. He has made changes in his life to ensure that he stays on a straight path and steers clear from trouble with the law. As a result of the present offences, the Accused resigned from the school and has withdrawn from the education service. He worked as a freelance writer for a magazine.

26     The Defence also informed that the Accused has no history of paedophilic or paraphilic (sexual deviant) tendencies. The Accused has strong familial support. The Defence submitted that the chances of the Accused re-offending in the future are low.

### Defence’s submission on sentence for the Digital Penetration offence

27     The Defence submitted that the sentencing adopted by the Prosecution for the Digital Penetration offence was too high and too harsh. The Defence relied on the sentence imposed in _AQW_ (see \[18\] above) in support of his submission.

28     The Defence also cited _PP v Yap Lee Kok_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 261</span> (“_Yap Lee Kok_”) in submitting for a low custodial sentence for the Digital Penetration offence. In _Yap Lee Kok_, the offender was a 57 years old male. The offender has a Facebook account but he used a different moniker. Through Facebook, the offender befriended the minor, who then 14 years old. This happened in the month of January 2019. In early February 2019, the offender met up with the minor at the ground floor lift lobby of a multi-storey carpark. The offender then brought the minor to his multi-purpose vehicle where he engaged in various sexual acts with the minor that included making the minor fellate him and having penile-vaginal intercourse with the minor. The offender was prosecuted for the sexual offences. He pleaded guilty to one count under s 376A(1)(_a_) punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC (for penetrating the mouth of the minor with his penis) and another count under s 376A(1)(_a_) punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC (for penetrating the vagina of the minor with his penis). The offender consented to have two other charges under s 376A(1)(_a_) of the PC and one other charge under s 292(1)(_a_) of the PC taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The District Judge sentenced the offender to 12 months’ imprisonment for the charge involving penetration of the minor’s mouth with the offender’s penis, and 18 months’ imprisonment for the other charge involving penetration of the minor’s vagina with the offender’s penis. The two sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently.

29     The Defence highlighted another case in which the offender, a teacher was jailed over sexual acts with a female student then 14 years of age. \[See Straits Times report published on 20 March 2020. This was attached as Annex C to Defence’s “Plea-in-Mitigation & Submissions on Sentence”.\] The offender was sentenced to 43 months’ imprisonment.

30     The Defence sought to distinguish the above case precedent on the facts. The offender and the minor had exchanged sexually charged text messages. The offender has showered the minor with gifts such as a watch and an iPhone before performing sexual acts on her. The offender had conspired with the minor to lie to her mother that she had to attend a remedial class when the offender had brought the minor to his flat for sex. The Defence submitted that the facts of this case precedent were far more serious than those in the Accused’s case. I interpreted the Defence’s argument to mean that the Accused should not receive an aggregate sentence higher than the above case precedent.

31     In conclusion, the Defence submitted for a sentence of ten months’ imprisonment for the Digital Penetration offence.

### Defence’s submissions on sentence for the CYPA offences

32     The Defence agreed with the Prosecution that _AQW_ is leading case authority on sentencing for the CYPA offences.

33     In addition to _AQW_, the Defence cited the following three cases:

> (a)      _PP v GCL_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 198</span>

>> The offender pleaded guilty to two charges under s 7(_a_) of the CYPA and one charge under s 7(_b_) of the CYPA. The offender consented to have three other charges under s 7(_a_) of the CYPA taken into consideration for purpose of sentencing. The offender was 32 years old and his victim was 15 years old. The offender was the victim’s school teacher. The offender had hugged the victim from behind, put the victim onto his lap and hugged her waist, kissed and licked her neck and ear area. The offender was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment per charge and a global sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment.

> (b)      _PP v GCE_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 189</span>

>> The offender was a 35 years old male teacher. He pleaded guilty to one charge under s 7(_a_) of the CYPA for kissing his victim, a female student 14 years of age, twice on her lips. The offender was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

> (c)     SC 905810-2019 [^1]

>> The offender was a secondary school teacher 34 years of age. The victim, 15 years of age, was his student. The offender and the victim often exchanged messages on Instagram. In September 2017, the offender met up with the victim at a void deck where he hugged and kissed her. They then went to a nearby bench where he again hugged and kissed her, and also touched her chest area. The next day, the offender messaged the victim asking the victim to be his girlfriend. The victim agreed on the condition that they would not do anything she was not comfortable with. Two days later, the offender kissed and hugged the victim again. He also tried to pressure the victim into having sex with him. The victim ended the relationship in mid-October 2017 but the offender persisted in messaging her and even proposed a “friends with benefits” arrangement, wanting to continue being intimate with her although they were no longer in a relationship. The offender was sentenced to 17 months’ imprisonment. (See Table below.)

34     The Defence submitted that in the Accused’s case an eight months’ imprisonment term would be an adequate punishment for each count of the proceeded CYPA charges.

### Other sentencing factors brought up by the Defence

35     The Defence urged the Court to consider the following:

> (a)     There was no violence or threats of violence;

> (b)     The Accused did not deceive the victim. He had not befriended the victim using different identities;

> (c)     The offences were committed on one day. There was no sexual exploitation over a prolonged period;

> (d)     There was no penetration using large or dangerous objects;

> (e)     The Accused is not a serial offender with multiple minors involved;

> (f)     There was no additional degradation or humiliation; and

> (g)     There was no act of repeated penetration.

36     The Defence finally argued that there was a delay in prosecution such that the Accused had been anxiously waiting for more than three years for the outcome of this case. This has taken a heavy toll on him and has caused him to suffer considerable mental anguish, anxiety and distress. The Defence relied on _Chan Kum Hong Randy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR 1019</span> at \[23\]:

> “_From the point of view of fairness to the offender, where there has been an inordinate delay in prosecution, the sentence should in appropriate cases reflect the fact that the matter has been held in abeyance for some time, possibly inflicting undue agony, suspense and uncertainty on the offender. …”_

### Summary of the Defence’s sentencing position

37     In summary, the Defence sought the following sentences:

> (a)     Ten months’ imprisonment for the Digital Penetration offence;

> (b)     Eight months’ imprisonment for each count of the CYPA offences; and

> (c)     The sentence for the Digital Penetration offence to run consecutively with one sentence for the CYPA offences with the sentence for the other CYPA offence to run concurrently. The Defence submitted that an aggregate sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment would be fair and just.

### Prosecution’s reply

38     The Prosecution did not agree with the Defence’s submissions. In short, the Prosecution pointed out that the Defence has completely failed to take into account the element of abuse of trust in its calibration of the appropriate sentences. In particular, in relation to the Digital Penetration offence, the Prosecution reiterated the decision of _BAB_ at \[65(a)\]:

>      _“For offences punishable under s 376A(2), where there is an element of abuse of trust, we consider that the starting point will be a term of imprisonment of three years, …”_

39     The Prosecution acknowledged that the Accused was charged about three years from the date of the commission of the offence. However, the Prosecution argued that this would not constitute the kind of inordinate delay for which the courts have recognised as warranting some reduction in sentence. The Prosecution argued that there was a second victim involved in the investigations against the Accused. Two out of the three TIC charges involved the second victim. Investigations took some time as the second victim needed to be traced and there were some issues getting the second victim to co-operate with the investigations.

## Court’s decision on sentence

### Applicable case precedents

40     It was an undisputed fact that there was a teacher-student relationship in this case. In the context of such a relationship, there is an element of trust. I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had abused this element of trust in the commission of the present offences by him.

41     This finding that there was an abuse of trust by the Accused is of utmost importance for two reasons. Firstly, it determined the correct case precedent that this court should consider when sentencing the Accused for the Digital Penetration offence. In this regard, the correct case precedent is that of _BAB_. Secondly, the starting indicative point of six to eight months’ imprisonment as set out in _AQW_ for the CYPA offences is meant for cases where there is no element of abuse of trust. Where the commission of the CYPA offence involved an element of abuse of trust, as was present in the Accused’s case, it is an aggravating factor that would warrant a higher starting indicative point.

42     I shall now proceed to state the grounds for the sentences I have passed.

### Sentence imposed for the Digital Penetration offence

43     For the Digital Penetration offence, the correct sentencing benchmark is that stated at \[65(a)\] of _BAB_ (reproduced in \[38\] above). For this reason alone, I rejected the Defence’s submissions (see \[27\] and \[28\] above).

44     Applying _BAB_ to the present case, I began with an indicative starting point of three years’ imprisonment. I then considered the sentencing factors raised by the Defence at \[35\]. However, this was only part of the overall assessment.

45     In view of the Prosecution’s acknowledgement that there was some delay in the charging of the Accused, I was prepared to give a little weight to the Defence’s submission for a reduction of the sentence.

46     As correctly pointed out by the Prosecution, there was a lead up to the commission of the offence. The SOF revealed that what started as a group meeting ended up as a meeting only between the Accused and the victim (see SOF at \[5\]). A pretext of a meeting to play cards (see SOF at \[7\]) turned to sitting inside the Accused’s car where he then seized the opportunity to sexually assault the victim. The Accused’s sexual transgression moved from touching of the thigh and neck to kissing of the neck (see SOF at \[9\]) before proceeding to unbuttoning the victim’s shirt. The Accused then procced to touch, kiss and suck the victim breast. In my judgement, he was emboldened. The SOF went on to state that the Accused then put his hand into the victim’s jeans and underwear and inserted his finger into her vagina. Even though the victim stopped him from proceeding further with the digital penetration, the Accused did not stop committing further sexual acts on the victim. The Accused persisted with another form of sexual offence, and this was by exposing his penis and placing the victim’s hand on his penis (see SOF at \[11\]). In my assessment, the Accused was unrelenting in his sexual assaults on the victim. He next drove the car to a multi-storey carpark and kissed the victim. The victim had to pull away from him (see SOF at \[12\]).

47     In my assessment, the sentencing factors raised by Defence and the weight given for the slight delay in charging the Accused are fairly balanced by the offence-specific factors in the lead up to, as well as, the commission of the Digital Penetration offence. I did not find any other significant sentencing factor that would warrant changing the indicative starting sentence of three years’ imprisonment.

48     I therefore finalised my assessment and imposed a sentence of three years’ imprisonment on the Accused for the Digital Penetration offence.

49     I pause here for a moment to state that during my assessment of the appropriate sentence for the Digital Penetration offence, I have studied the CA’s decision in _Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span> (_“Pram Nair”)_. In _Pram Nair_, the appellant was convicted by the High Court of two charges – one for rape under s 375(1)(_a_) of the PC and one for sexual assault by digital penetration under s 376(2)(_a_) of the PC. (Note: The appellant penetrated the victim’s vagina with his finger.) The High Court sentenced him to 12 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for each charge. The imprisonment terms were reduced to 11 years and 19 days for each offence to take into account the time that the appellant had spent in remand before being released on bail. With both sentences ordered to run concurrently, the appellant’s aggregate sentence was 11 years and 19 days’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The Appellant appealed against his sentence and the appeal was allowed in part.

50     In _Pram Nair_, the CA established a sentencing benchmark for the sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2) of the PC (_cf_ in our present case, the charge is under s 376A(1)(_b_) punishable under s 376A(2) of the PC.) The CA was conscious of the possible relevance of the proposed sentencing benchmark under s 376 to s 376A (see _Pram Nair_ at \[161\]). The CA then went on to state that “_in light of the sentencing benchmark set for a s 376 offence, the starting point of three years’ imprisonment for a s 376A(2) offence in BAB may now look rather lenient_.” (see _Pram Nair_ at \[163\]). After noting the differences in the prescribed punishment for s 376 and s 376A, the CA did not disturb the sentencing benchmark in _BAB_ and left the issue to be addressed on another occasion. I held the view that it would not be appropriate for a District Court to review the sentencing benchmark established in _BAB_.

### Sentence imposed for the CYPA offences

51     Following from \[41\] above, it is my assessment that the indicative starting point, after taking into account the element of abuse of trust, should be nine months’ imprisonment.

52     Three charges were taken into consideration in which two charges involved a second victim, who was below the age of 16 years at the time of the commission of the offences. To cover up his transgressions, the Accused told the victim not to tell any one of the incident (see SOF at \[14\]). In my assessment, this is an aggravating factor. Finally, I took into account the harm suffered by the victim for she had stopped going to school after 27 February 2019 (see SOF at \[15\]). In my deliberation, I found that a further three months uplift of the indicative starting point was warranted. As such, at this stage of my assessment, I was minded to impose a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment on each count of the two CYPA offences.

53     In _BAB_, the offender pleaded guilty, _inter alia_, to a single count of the CYPA offence. The sexual violation involved kissing the victim on the lips and licking her breasts and nipples while the victim was under 14 years of age. The offender was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment. I was therefore fortified in my assessment that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was an adequate punishment for each of the two proceeded CYPA offences. Accordingly, I finalised my assessment and imposed the said sentence for the CYPA offences

### Applicable sentencing principle

54     In my judgment, general deterrence is applicable to this case. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender. Deterrence is generally not displaced as an applicable sentencing consideration even where an offender demonstrates that he was labouring under familial and financial hardships during the commission of the offence: see _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”) at \[24\] – \[25\], \[27\] and \[29\].

55     I also held the view that specific deterrence in sentencing was applicable in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an accused to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition: _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[25\] – \[29\].

56     After taking another look at the sentences, I did not find any ground to make any other adjustments. I was also of the view that the sentences would be adequate for its deterrence value.

### Application of s 307 CPC

57     The Prosecution and the Defence were both in agreement that the sentence for the Digital Penetration offence should run consecutively with one count of the CYPA offences. The sentence for the other CYPA offences was to run concurrently. I found this to be correct in law and I so ordered.

58     In summary, the final sentences meted out are set out in Table A at \[3\] above.

## Conclusion

59     It is my judgment that an aggregate sentence of three years and 12 months imprisonment was on the whole proportionate to the Accused’s culpability and the harm caused.

60     The Accused was dissatisfied with the sentences imposed. He has filed an appeal against sentence. The Accused did not apply for bail pending appeal. He has commenced serving the sentence from 30 November 2020.
