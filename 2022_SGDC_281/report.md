### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was 14 years old (Date of Birth: 18 July 2004) when the offences were committed. She claimed trial to the following two charges:

> DAC 908930/2021

> _You, are charged that you, on the 26th day of June 2019, at or about 2.36am, at Blk 602 Woodlands Drive 42 Singapore 730602, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Station Inspector Ezzadin Kamaruddin, Police Officer, a public servant, with intent to deter him from discharging his duty, to wit, by kicking Station Inspector Ezzadin Kamaruddin on his leg, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

> DAC 908931/2021

> _are charged that you, on the 26th day of June 2019, at or about 2.36am, at Blk 602 Woodlands Drive 42 Singapore 730602, did use criminal force on one Station Inspector Ezzadin Kamaruddin, Police Officer, a public servant, with intent to deter him from discharging his duty, to wit, by pulling down Station Inspector Ezzadin Kamaruddin’s lanyard while it was still hung on his neck, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

2       13 other charges were stood down pending the outcome of the trial. At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty on both charges and convicted her accordingly.

3       At the point of sentencing, the Accused was 18 years old. In view of her age, I called for pre-sentence reports to assess her suitability for both reformative training and probation. The Accused was found unsuitable for probation but physically and mentally suitable for reformative training. I sentenced the Accused to reformative training with Level Two intensity of rehabilitation, as recommended in the report. This was a minimum of 12-months detention in a Reformative Training Centre.

4       The Accused’s appeal is in respect of the sentence only.

## Brief Facts of the Case

5       On 26 June 2019 at or about 12.53 a.m., a “999” call was made to the police with the following information: _“I have a girl here. I think she has ran away from home. She also said that she wants to commit suicide.”_[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) The location given was a fitness corner at Block 602 Woodlands Drive 42, Singapore 730602.

6       In response to the call, police officers, including PW1 Station Inspector Ezzadin Kamaruddin (“SI Ezzadin”), were despatched to Block 602 Woodlands Avenue 4. Thereat, they found the Accused sitting on a bench. The footage from the body-worn cameras (“BWC”) of SI Ezzadin as well as that of other uniformed police officers captured the interaction between the Accused and the police officers at the scene[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

7       In the course of the interaction, as the police officers’ efforts to persuade the Accused to go home failed and the Accused attempted to leave the scene, the Accused pulled SI Ezzadin’s lanyard while it was still around his neck and also kicked his leg. The Accused was then placed under arrest[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

8       SI Ezzadin was examined by Dr Chung Pin Soon at Woodlands Polyclinic on the same day and was found to have a contusion on his leg[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4).

9       On the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I thus found the Accused guilty on both the charges and convicted her accordingly.

## The Appropriate Sentence

10     It is well-established that for an offender of the Accused’s age, rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration. The overall facts and circumstances of the case did not displace the Court’s focus on rehabilitation as its objective in sentencing[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5). With that in mind, I called for both pre-sentence Probation as well as Reformative Training suitability reports.

### Accused Found Unsuitable for Probation

11     The Accused was not found suitable for probation. In a summary at page 2 of her report, the Probation Officer Ms Aswanee, highlighted several risk factors in relation to the Accused:

> (a)     The Accused’s involvement in the offences were contributed by her blatant disregard for the law and authorities, risk-taking tendencies and limited consequential thinking;

> (b)     Her tendency to resort to aggression when encountered with emotional triggers emphasize the Accused’s dysfunctional coping skills and the potential safety concerns to herself and others should she be in the community;

> (c)     The Accused’s lack of cooperation with professionals, multiple inconsistencies in her accounts during social investigations and tendency to not be forthcoming indicate her poor readiness to undergo rehabilitation in the community and unwillingness to accept responsibility for her actions;

> (d)     History of staying away from home and placements highlights her flight risk, if placed in an open institution;

> (e)     Her tendency to externalize blame and deny responsibility for the commission of all infringements reflect her pro-criminal attitude and offence-supportive thoughts;

> (f)     Persistent poor conduct despite the admission to Singapore Girls’ Home, coupled with limited responsiveness to prior interventions, highlight the Accused’s active rejection to help and lack of commitment to internalize learnings to address her risks and needs; and

> (g)     Strained familial ties, their limited inability to provide effective supervision and the absence of an alternate suitable caregiver would pose as challenges for the Accused to desist from offending.

12     In stark contrast, there were no strengths or protective factors found in the Accused’s case. The details supporting these findings were elaborately and clearly set out in the Probation Officer’s 29-page Probation report. Her thorough social investigation into the Accused’s circumstances led her to the conclusion that the Accused would not be suitable for probation.

13     There was no basis to disagree with the findings of the Probation Officer. One protective factor which is often critical for a young offender’s rehabilitation in the community was sorely lacking in the Accused’s case: familial support. Both the Accused’s father and mother shared that they have strained relationships with the Accused since 2015[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6). This was echoed by the Accused herself, who even expressed to the Probation Officer that she did not want her parents to be involved in her rehabilitation[^7].

14     In the absence of strong and supportive family relationships within the Accused’s immediate community, the Probation Officer had also considered the viability of engaging other adults who may be responsible for the Accused’s rehabilitation in the community, namely one Ms Vivian Khoo at River of Life (a hostel run by a church). However, even though Ms Khoo was willing to provide care for the Accused, she expressed concerns and a lack of confidence in managing the Accused’s flight risk and aggression[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8). When questioned by the Accused in court about this upon the presentation of her recommendations, Ms Aswanee similarly explained that Ms Khoo was not assessed to be a suitable alternate caregiver for the Accused due to misgivings which Ms Khoo had[^9].

15     As an alternative, the Probation Officer also explored a period of hostel residence for the Accused. However, given the Accused’s risk factors, behavioural and mental health (Accused had been diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)) concerns, she was of the view that the Accused would benefit from continued psychological and/or psychiatric interventions while in a closed and structured environment[^11].

16     Overall, the Probation Officer assessed that rehabilitation for the Accused in the community was not appropriate. In court, she reiterated her view that the Accused’s tendency to resort to aggression when encountered with emotional triggers emphasized her dysfunctional and coping skills which pose potential safety concerns to herself and others if placed in a community. The Accused had also demonstrated persistent poor conduct while in Singapore Girls’ Home. Her lack of responsiveness to prior interventions were indicative of her active rejection to help and commitment to internalise learnings. The Accused’s history of staying away from home and placements highlighted her flight risk, even if placed in an open institution[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12). Apart from flight risk and Accused’s aggression, there were multiple risk concerns in placing the Accused in the community, such as her blatant disregard for the law and authorities, risk-taking tendencies and belated consequential thinking. The Accused’s tendencies to externalise blame and deny responsibility for commission of all infringements also reflected her pro-criminal attitude and offence-supportive thoughts.[^13]. The Accused’s risk of re-offending was high, based on the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI)[^14].

17     Having perused the detailed report of the Probation Officer and having heard her testimony in court, I was satisfied that the Probation Officer had thoroughly considered the viability of probation for the Accused but was not able to recommend it.

### Reformative Training as the Appropriate Sentence

18     The Accused was found physically and mentally suitable for a term of reformative training. The Reformative Training report recognized that the Accused had multiple needs that required intervention, namely in the areas of her conflicted and strained family relationships, lack of pro-social companions, difficulty in education and employment, unconstructive use of leisure time, impulsivity, poor frustration tolerance and violent behaviours[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15). A level two intensity of rehabilitation was recommended.

19     As re-emphasized in _Public Prosecutor v Ong Jack Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 166</span>, at \[11\], “_the imposition of reformative training remains within the range of sentencing options for young offenders where the focus is on rehabilitation……..reformative training too is geared towards the rehabilitation of the offender and hence remains a viable option_”. At \[14\], the Court went on to state: “_the choice between reformative training and probation is governed primarily by whether there is in the circumstances a need for a degree of deterrence within an overarching focus and emphasis on rehabilitation_”.

20     In this case, I was satisfied that a term of reformative training would be the appropriate sentence for the Accused. The nature of the offences called for a degree of deterrence. The Accused was convicted under sections 332 and 353 of the Penal Code, for kicking the leg and pulling the lanyard of a uniformed police officer as he was in the course of discharging his duty. The sentencing and public interest considerations in respect of such offences have been fully contemplated in the cases of _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span>, _Ho Mei Xia Hannah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 978</span> et al.

21     The nature of the offences aside, the Accused had several behavioural and mental health issues (highlighted in both the Probation as well as Reformative Training suitability reports), which a period of rehabilitation in a Reformative Training Centre (“RTC”) would be better-placed to address. The Probation Officer had similarly opined that the Accused would benefit from continued rehabilitation, which includes continued psychological and psychiatric interventions in a “_closed and structured environment_”.

22     I was satisfied that the recommended term of a Level Two intensity of rehabilitation which carried with it a minimum of a 12-month detention in the RTC, would not be a disproportionate sentence. As the Court in _Public Prosecutor v Saiful Rizam bin Assim_ and other appeals <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 495</span> reminded at \[25\]: _“It must be borne in mind that reformative training is a special programme put in place for young offenders. Of course it has an element of punishment in it as the young offender is deprived of his liberty. Parliament had, in its wisdom, deemed it fit to impose a minimum period of 18 months in order to ensure that the programme would achieve its objective of rehabilitating the young offender. Thus when the principle of proportionality is being considered, the aim of the reformative programme must not be lost sight of.”_ The Court in _Saiful Rizam_ considered the fact that the minimum period of reformative training (18 months) [^16] was longer than what the District Judge intended to impose on offenders Saiful and Yunus (seven months imprisonment and 14 months imprisonment respectively) and added that that should not have stood as a bar to reformative training being ordered against them.

23     I was cognisant of the fact that the Accused was a first offender. Even though she had need of several social interventions in the course of her young life, which included a placement in Singapore Girls’ Home under a Family Guidance Order, she had not been convicted of any offence before. However, whilst I was mindful that a Level Two intensity of rehabilitation may be longer than the imprisonment term these offences might carry, that in itself should not be an impediment to a term of reformative training being imposed on the Accused. What was clear in my mind was that the Accused was in need of rehabilitation for that period of time, in a closed and structured environment.

24     Having regard to the Accused’s character and the circumstances of the offences, I was satisfied that a term of reformative training would be the most appropriate sentence for this young girl.

## Conclusion

25     After the Accused was sentenced to RTC, the Prosecution applied to withdraw the remaining 13 charges (all of which involved offences against public servants) against the Accused. Accordingly, I granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on all 13 charges.

26     The Accused is currently serving her term of RT.
