### Deputy Registrar Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1        _Auto Clean ‘N’ Shine Services (a firm) v Eastern Publishing Associates Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 427</span> (“_Auto Clean_”) is a landmark decision that brought much clarity on the court’s approach towards applications seeking leave to call additional witnesses out of time. The Court of Appeal in that case issued a salutary reminder that directions issued at the interlocutory stage are not immutable and that courts should be conscious of circumstances that may constraint parties from naming all their witnesses in the summons for directions. On the facts of that case, the court allowed the plaintiffs to call additional witnesses on the account that the proceedings were still at a relatively early stage and no prejudice would be caused to the defendants (at \[17\]-\[18\]).

2       Given what may have been perceived by many as a fairly low threshold, _Auto Clean_, despite its vintage, continues to be often cited by practitioners seeking to adduce further evidence after the expiry of court-imposed timelines. The present case is no exception. Citing _Auto Clean_, the Defendant sought to adduce further evidence at the doorstep of an assessment of damages hearing. The Plaintiff resisted the application, arguing the additional evidence exceeded the Defendant’s pleaded case, and allowing the application without requiring the Defendant to amend his pleadings would severely prejudice the Plaintiff. Further complicating matters was the fact that parties had previously entered consent interlocutory judgment, which the Plaintiff contended must be set aside before the Defendant could amend his pleadings. The Plaintiff contended that all of these are matters that distinguish this case from the facts in _Auto Clean_. After hearing parties, I found myself in broad agreement with the Plaintiff’s submissions, and dismissed the Defendant’s application with brief oral grounds. As this case raises some interesting issues yet examined by Singapore courts in a reported decision, I publish my analysis in this written grounds of decision.

## Background facts

3       This action concerns a motor accident that occurred on 10 July 2017 at around 11.20 pm. The Defendant’s vehicle collided into the Plaintiff’s vehicle while he was reversing into a parking lot. The Plaintiff’s vehicle was at that time parked within an adjacent lot. Due to the slow speed of the reversal, it is undisputed that the impact of the collision was minor. But the effects of the collision were far from minor, according to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff claimed that he suffered a neck sprain and chest contusion from the collision. The Plaintiff was a Grab driver who averred that he was catching some sleep in between his rides. Startled by the sudden impact of the collision, he jolted from his seat and hit his chest against the steering wheel. According to him, that was how the injuries came about.

4       The Plaintiff brought this action to recover damages on 29 November 2018. The Defendant initially contested liability, disputing causation was made out. In his pleaded case, he denied that the collision had caused any injuries. Eventually, parties agreed to enter interlocutory judgment by consent at 100% liability, with the issue of causation reserved to the assessment of damages. The consent interlocutory judgment dated 22 May 2019 (“Interlocutory Judgment”) reads:

> … Interlocutory Judgment be entered in favour of the Plaintiff at 100%, with the issue of causation and damages to be assessed by the Registrar and interest and costs to be reserved to the Registrar.

5       I pause to note that there seems to be a logical contradiction in the terms of the Interlocutory Judgment. It is not clear how is it possible that interlocutory judgment can be entered at “100%” without resolving the issue of causation. I say this because causation is a necessary element to establish liability for the tort of negligence. If the Registrar hearing the assessment of damages finds that the accident and/or the injuries were not fully attributable to the Defendant’s actions, the resulting ruling ought to be that the Defendant is not 100% liable. Be that as it may, neither party took issue with this nor did this contradiction appear to have any bearing on the issues before me. I need not be detained by this wrinkle and will move on.

6       After entering Interlocutory Judgment, directions were given for parties to file their respective affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) by 22 August 2019. The Plaintiff filed his on 30 August 2019. The Defendant chose not to file an AEIC. Eventually the matter was set down for assessment of damages. Parties then underwent neutral evaluation sessions conducted by the State Courts. As parties were unable to resolve matters amicably, an assessment of damages hearing was fixed on 20 April 2020. The hearing was re-fixed to 24 July 2020 due to the elevated physical distancing measures termed as the “Circuit Breaker” implemented by the Government to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

7       On 6 July 2020, the Defendant filed the present application seeking leave to admit a Singapore Accident Statement dated 8 July 2017 (the “Prior Accident Statement”). The Prior Accident Statement was prepared by Plaintiff in respect of another motor accident he was involved in two days prior to the present accident. The prior accident involved a different motorist who rear-ended into the Plaintiff’s vehicle. The Plaintiff declared no injuries to have been suffered in the Prior Accident Statement. Be that as it may, the Defendant sought to adduce this in evidence, averring in his supporting affidavit that this document is “material” on the “causation of the Plaintiff’s injuries”. No reasons were given for the alleged materiality. No explanation was also given for his failure to adduce this earlier.

8       The application was fixed together with the assessment of damages hearing before me on 24 July 2020. At the hearing, the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff suffered no prejudice since the Prior Accident Statement ought to have been within the Plaintiff’s knowledge and possession.

9       The Plaintiff took umbrage at the late stage at which the Defendant was seeking to adduce further evidence. Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Raj Singh Shegill (“Mr Shegill”) argued that the Defendant’s insurer was being dilatory. The accident happened about three years ago and the proceedings were commenced about two years ago, yet no steps were taken to adduce this piece of evidence earlier. He emphasised that the Prior Accident Statement was available at their disposal from the get-go, as it was easily retrievable from a central online database, but the Defendant’s insurer adduced it only at the doorstep of the assessment of damages hearing.[^1]

10     The Plaintiff raised two broad arguments to resist the application. First is that the Defendant’s insurer, despite being in flagrant breach of the procedural timelines, has not furnished any ground or material for the court to exercise discretion in its favour.[^2] The second is that the evidence sought to be adduced went beyond the Defendant’s pleaded case.[^3] In this regard, the Plaintiff highlighted that the Defendant’s pleaded case on causation was merely a bare denial, namely, that the accident did not cause any injuries. Now, in an about turn, the Defendant pointed to a prior accident as the cause of the alleged injuries. The prior accident had not been pleaded.

11     Ordinarily, the applicant’s recourse would have been to seek leave to amend its pleadings and align them to the fresh evidence. But the Defendant did not do so in this case. In any event, Mr Shegill was quick to point out that this option had been foreclosed by the entry of the Interlocutory Judgment.[^4] To amend his pleadings, he argued that the Defendant would first need to set aside the Interlocutory Judgment. Mr Shegill explained that the Interlocutory Judgment has to be set aside because, in light of the fresh allegation, the Plaintiff would have had to seriously consider joining the other motorist as a co-defendant and put the Defendant on notice of a _Sanderson_ or _Bullock_ order being made against them at the end of trial (see _Singapore Civil Procedure_ 2020, vol 1 (Hon Justice Chua Lee Ming ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th ed, 2020) (“_Singapore Civil Procedure_”) at para 15/4/17).

12     Mr Shegill also submitted that the further evidence cannot supplant the basic requirement that all material facts must be pleaded. Based on this single document, the Plaintiff did not know what was the case he had to meet and was left to speculate the precise allegations that the Defendant intended to raise during cross-examination.[^5] As a result, there was no opportunity for him to prepare rebuttal evidence. Mr Shegill argued that this invoked O 18 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”), a provision which specifies matters that must be specifically pleaded.

13     In response, counsel for the Defendant, Ms Leow Yu Jun (“Ms Leow”) took the position that the fresh evidence fell within the ambit of their pleaded case and thus no amendment was necessary, drawing my attention to this passage in para 9 of the Defence in which the Defendant put causation into issue:

> In the event the Defendant consents to Judgement on liability or there is a finding of liability against the Defendant at trial for the accident, the Defendant will nevertheless raise the issue of causation (therefore the accident could not have caused the Plaintiff to sustain injuries or injuries to such extent) at the assessment of damages. This right of the Defendant to raise causation is never waived at any stage of the proceeding.

14     Ms Leow further argued that since the Defendant denied the causal link between the accident and the injuries, with the issue of causation expressly reserved in the Interlocutory Judgment, the Defendant ought to be allowed to lead evidence on this at the assessment of damages hearing.[^6]

## Decision

15     It is hornbook law that pleadings demarcate the boundaries in which a legal battle is fought. This is a cardinal principle of procedural fair play that entails various consequences, two of which take prominence in the present application. First, evidence led at trial ought to be confined to the scope of the pleadings. Second, the court is not obliged to (and rarely does) give a judgment in excess of what has been pleaded. The overriding objective of these rules is to ensure nobody is taken by surprise at trial. The days of trial by ambush are long over. If a party wants to admit evidence on matters outside of the pleaded facts, the proper course is to first amend its pleadings. This is not a mere technical requirement; the amendment puts the other party on notice of the precise case it has to meet. If the pleaded case lacks clarity or precision, the other party is at liberty to seek further and better particulars. It is only when the pleaded case is sufficiently clear that the other party can properly investigate the allegations, seek discovery of relevant documents and assemble rebuttal evidence. These are all time-honoured principles that have been repeatedly endorsed by our courts (see for instance _Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd v Intraco Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 2 SLR(R) 382</span> at \[22\]-\[24\] and _V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 1422</span> at \[34\]-\[37\]).

16     Bearing these principles in mind, it is clear to me that the Defendant’s allegation that a third-party causative agent was responsible for the injuries is a material fact that must be specifically pleaded. As a starting point, I refer to O 18 r 8 of the Rules of Court which specifies matters that must be specifically pleaded. The provision reads:

> **Matters which must be specifically pleaded (O.18, r.8)**

> **8.**—(1)    A party must in any pleading subsequent to a statement of claim plead specifically any matter, for example, performance, release, any relevant statute of limitation, fraud or any fact showing illegality

>> (a)    which he alleges makes any claim or defence of the opposite party not maintainable;

>> (b)    which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise; or

>> (c)    which raises issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleading.

>> …

17     When the Defendant alleged that the injuries were caused by the prior accident, he was obviously seeking to defeat the Plaintiff’s claim fully or at least to the extent that the court finds the causative agent responsible for the injuries. Such an allegation amply seeks to make the claim “not maintainable”, thereby invoking O 18 r 8(1)(a) of the Rules of Court. This is consistent with the common law rule that a defendant seeking to “avoid” liability “must plead all material facts relied on as constituting an ‘avoidance’ of what he otherwise confesses or admits to” (Sir Jack Jacob and Iain S Goldrein, _Pleadings: Principles and Practice_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 1990) (“_Pleadings: Principles and Practice_”) at p 134, cited with approval in _SCT Technologies Pte Ltd v Western Copper Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 1471</span> (“_SCT Technologies_”) at \[23\]). In my view, O 18 r 8(1)(_a_) of the Rules of Court is a codification of this common law rule. A defendant seeking to avoid liability by pinning the blame on a third party should therefore plead the material facts of that allegation. This principle is borne out in _Sundram v Arujunan & Anor_ \[1994\] 3 MLJ 361 (“_Sundram v Arujunan_”) where the Supreme Court of Kuala Lumpur held that (at 370):

> If a defendant seeks to avoid liability by blaming a third party, the better practice is for him to plead it specifically instead of merely relying on a denial of negligence because the plaintiff might otherwise be taken by surprise.

18     The principle underlying the need to plead material facts relied upon to avoid liability is that they are prone to taking the claimant by surprise if raised only at trial. This common law principle is also expressly codified in O 18 r 8(1)(_b_) of the Rules of Court. In my view, the fresh allegation raised by the Defendant, if not specifically pleaded, might take the Plaintiff by surprise. For starters, the denial currently pleaded gives no clue as to why exactly the Defendant was disputing causation. Even if the Prior Accident Statement were admitted in evidence, the precise ambit of the Defendant’s case remains remarkably murky. If the Defendant were left to his own devices, he would be free to morph his case throughout the proceedings. The Defendant’s reliance on the Prior Accident Statement, without further explanation, lends itself to various interpretations. For instance, one could speculate it to take on one or more of the following variations:

> (a)     the Plaintiff had mistakenly attributed the injury to the present accident as opposed to the prior accident; or

> (b)     the Plaintiff had deliberately attributed the injury to the present accident even though he knew the real cause of the injury was the prior accident.

19     In either variation of its case, the Plaintiff would likely have to investigate the impact of the collision and obtain expert opinion on whether the prior accident was capable of inflicting the injury in the magnitude and nature complained of. The Plaintiff may also require an opinion as to whether it was medically possible for the injuries to surface two days after the prior accident. More significantly, the second variation contains an allegation of fraud, which according to O 18 r 12 of the Rules of Court, must be specifically pleaded (see also _The “Ohm Mariana” ex “Peony”_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 113</span> at \[48\]-\[51\]). It is therefore incumbent on the Defendant to plead and particularise his case, so that the Plaintiff would know the exact case he has to meet at trial.

20     The Defendant claimed that the denial currently pleaded sufficiently captures his latest averments. I respectfully disagree. It is one thing to say that the Defendant’s actions did not cause the alleged injuries, but quite another to say that the alleged injuries were caused by another incident. The former is a bare denial, whereas the latter is a positive allegation. The law draws a sharp dichotomy between bare denials and positive allegations. This dichotomy bears significant evidential implications. As the authors of the _Singapore Civil Procedure_ noted at para 18/13/4, if a defendant denies part of a claim, he is “not entitled to call evidence of fact contrary to the plaintiff’s contention without first setting out his positive case in his defence” (see also _Arul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 111</span> (“_Arul Chandran_”) at \[204\] and _Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 265</span> (“_Nagase_”) at \[177\]). This dovetails with the evidential rule that a party pleading a bare denial is not required to prove his case; the legal burden rests on the party making the positive allegation. This rule was elaborated by the Court of Appeal in _Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 63</span> as follows:

> 31 In civil trials, the pleadings are central in determining the occurrence of the burden of proof, because the pleadings state the material facts establishing the legal elements of a claim or a defence: Pinsler, _Evidence and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2010) at para 12.33; _Phipson on Evidence_ (Hodge M Malek gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 17th ed, 2009) (“_Phipson_”) at para 6-06. **The** **_legal_** **burden of proving a pleaded defence rests on the proponent of the defence, unless the defence is a bare denial of the claim**: _Currie v Dempsey_ \[1967\] 2 NSWR 532 at 539, followed by the Singapore High Court in _Wee Yue Chew v Su Sh-Hsyu_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 212</span> at \[3\]. This rule is consistent with the general principle underlying ss 103 and 105 of the Evidence Act, _viz_, that he who asserts must prove. …

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

21     It is trite law that he who asserts must prove. Assertions are born out of pleadings. As the Court of Appeal held in _SCT Technologies_ at \[17\], “it is in the pleadings that one finds the material facts that each party asserts to establish its claim or defence (as the case may be)”. Bare denials are inherently devoid of factual assertions. While a plea of denial (as opposed to non-admission) may imply that the defendant knows an allegation is untrue, the fact of the matter is that the defendant has chosen to stay silent on the factual premise of the denial and not assert his own version of the facts. Unlike in England where the defendant denying an allegation has to “state his reasons for doing so” and “state his own version” if he intends to put forward a “different version of events” (see rule 16.5 of the UK Civil Procedure Rules 1998), the current iteration of our Rules of Court imposes no such requirement. The effect of this is that defendants are allowed to plead bare denials. But defendants who make this tactical decision must also accept its consequences, which is that they would not be allowed lead evidence to disprove the claimant’s case. Only the claimant – who has pleaded a positive case – has the right to lead evidence at trial to prove his case. The proposition that a bare denial merely puts the burden of proof on the claimant has been endorsed in various authorities; see for instance: _Warner v Sampson_ \[1959\] 1 QB 297 (“_Warner v Sampson_”) at 311; _Pinson v Lloyd and National Provincial Foreign Bank_ <span class="citation">\[1941\] 2 KB 72</span> (“_Pinson_”) at 83; _Arul Chandran_ at \[204\]; and _Pleadings: Principles and Practice_ at p 121.

22     Many authorities simply accept this principle as trite without explaining its underlying rationale; but in my view this principle is eminently fair and accords with the objectives of pleadings. Without sufficient notice of the countervailing factual case that might be advanced at trial, the claimant cannot be expected to adequately understand and prepare to meet the defendant’s case (_Aven and others v Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd_ \[2020\] EWHC 523 at \[53\]). In these premises, it is plainly fair to disallow the defendant from leading evidence to disprove the claim. Allowing the evidence to be led – without the positive allegations being pleaded by way of an amendment – would be to condone a trial by ambush.

23     There are of course instances where a seemingly bare denial is actually “pregnant with an affirmative allegation” (_Warner v Sampson_ at 319), but this is not such a case for reasons which I will explain shortly. In _Arul Chandran_, Chan Seng Onn JC (as he then was) defined such a denial as one that implicitly contains an affirmative allegation of fact at \[204\]:

> A traverse by denial of a negative averment may simply remain as a mere denial with nothing to be implied and as a consequence, the defendant will not be allowed at the trial to call evidence and set up in his defence an affirmative case to the contrary, which has not been specifically pleaded. Essentially, the defendant by such a mere denial would be simply putting the plaintiff to strict proof. _But in certain cases, the double negative contains within itself an affirmative allegation. This is the ‘pregnant negative’, which clearly imports a positive assertion of fact, where particulars may be ordered, if not so given._ The third possibility is that the matter is left in doubt in which case the pleading may be struck out as being embarrassing unless made clearer by an amendment.

> \[emphasis added\]

24     The archetypical “pregnant negative” or “pregnant denial” is one where, as Chan JC observed, there is a “double negative” plea. _IRC v Jackson_ <span class="citation">\[1960\] 1 WLR 873</span> offers a good illustration of this. In that case, the claimant pleaded that the defendant failed to furnish information as to his sources of income “without reasonable excuse”. The defendant denied this. By the defendant’s denial, the English Court of Appeal found that the defendant had implicitly affirmed that he did have a reasonable excuse to not furnish information and as such ordered him to provide particulars of that plea. Referring to _IRC v Jackson_, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) expressed her views on what constitutes such a plea as follows (_Nagase_ at \[172\]):

> Sellers LJ in _IRC v Jackson_ seemed to be of the opinion, not directly expressed, that _there was really only one interpretation of the defendant’s denial_, and as such, it should be considered as an affirmative allegation. I think that the fundamental, though unstated, principle is clear – _the “pregnant negative” denial must make it obvious to the plaintiff what the defence is, rather than merely be seen to be putting the plaintiff to strict proof of his own claim_.

> \[emphasis added\]

25     In the present case, all that was pleaded was a bare denial on the causal link between the accident and the injuries. The Defence gave no indication as to the basis of the denial. Without factual material supporting the denial, the Plaintiff was left in the dark as to why the Defendant is denying the allegation. It is not obvious what the Defendant was truly alleging. But at the same time the law as it stands generally does not permit a claimant to seek particulars of a mere denial unless the denial is itself vague and embarrassing (_Singapore Civil Procedure_ at para 18/12/47; _Weinberger v Inglis_ \[1918\] 1 Ch 133; _Stapeley v Annetts_ \[1969\] 3 All ER 1541 at 1542; _Pinson_ at 83-84 and 86; and _Pleadings: Principles and Practice_ at p 130). As such, the bare denial in this instance signals to the Plaintiff that he has to prove his injuries by reference to its own pleaded case which was that the Defendant had collided into the Plaintiff’s vehicle. It would not be reasonable to expect the Plaintiff to speculate what evidence the Defendant might lead at trial to disprove his case, much less prepare for the eventuality that the Defendant would be leading evidence on the prior accident. In order to lead evidence on the third-party causative agent that the Defendant now asserts, the material facts supporting that assertion must first be pleaded. The Defence contained no material facts supporting the Defendant’s latest averment.

26     The Defendant also argued that the Prior Accident Statement goes towards evidence which need not be pleaded. With respect, this misses the point. Whether or not the Prior Accident Statement constitutes relevant evidence does not detract from the requirement to plead material facts. Evidence goes towards proving the material facts (see s 5 of the Evidence Act). The facts must first be pleaded, before evidence proving the same may be led. Facts that are not pleaded should not be allowed to be proved at trial (_Multi-Pak_ at \[24\]). The material facts surrounding the prior accident have not been pleaded.

27      _Davie v New Merton Board Mills Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1956\] 1 WLR 233</span> (“_Davie v New Merton Board_”) further illustrates the injustice that might be occasioned should the evidence be led without a prior amendment to the Defence. The defendant in this case was also barred from leading evidence on the involvement of a third party by reason of a bare denial in his pleadings. The plaintiff in that case was an employee of the defendants who was injured while using a draft and hammer when a splinter flew off from the draft and entered his left eye. The plaintiff sued the defendant for negligently supplying him with a safe draft. The defendants denied all the allegations in the pleaded defence. During the opening of the plaintiff’s case, the defendant indicated that they would be calling evidence to show that the draft was bought by them from a firm of reputable manufacturers and thus they were not negligent. Counsel for the defendants argued that they were not obliged to plead the involvement of a third party since the material allegations had been denied and the purchase of the draft was a matter that went towards evidence. Counsel for the plaintiff objected to the application on the basis that the defendants had taken the plaintiff by surprise. He explained that the plaintiff had no inkling who was supposed to have supplied the draft and further it would be unfair to the plaintiff to go on and perhaps lose the case, pay all the costs and then have to sue the manufacturers. The end result would be to burden him with two actions and two sets of costs, one of which he would have to pay himself. Hayer J agreed with the plaintiff and remarked that the defendants’ submission would leave the plaintiff in a “very unfortunate position” because supposing the defendants succeeded in that defence, he would have had “no opportunity of joining any other person”. Hayer J also accepted the plaintiff was taken by surprised as it was not clear from the bare denial what the defendant actually meant. In light of Hayer J’s ruling, the defendants sought leave to amend their pleadings.

28      _Davie v New Merton Board_ was cited with approval by G P Selvam J in _Gunapathy Muniandy v James Khoo and Others_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 165</span>, where he similarly disallowed the defendant from raising a positive case theory that was not pleaded:

> **A positive case must be pleaded**

> 13.1. It is necessary to begin this chapter with a point of law relating to procedure and evidence. Stated in a sentence : _When a defendant has an affirmative case of his own in answer to the plaintiff’s assertions he must specifically state it in the defence. He cannot content himself with a mere denial._ As Buckley LJ said succinctly "reasons of practice and justice and convenience require the party to tell his opponent what he is coming to prove". See In _Re Robinson’s Settlement, Gant v Hobbs_ \[1912\] 1 Ch 717 at p 728

> 13.2. It is a positive requirement that a defendant must state his positive case. _He is not permitted to insinuate his after thoughts into a bare denial. The purpose of a denial is to dispute and force the plaintiff to prove his case. A denial does not entitle the defendant to cast about and come up with justifications at the trials._ Such conduct cannot be condoned particularly when his new defence negatives a positive case framed before the close of pleadings. Should he do so he will crush his own credibility. See generally _Davie v New Merton Board Mills Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1956\] 1 WLR 233</span>.

> 13.3. The point arose in _Regina Fur Company Ltd v Bossom_ \[1958\] 2 Lloyds Law Rep 425. Lord Evershed MR at p 427 made the point with great flair and force:

>> A defendant – whether he is an underwriter or any other kind of defendant – is entitled to say , by way of defence, "I require this case to be strictly proved, and admit nothing". Where such is the defence, the onus remains throughout upon the plaintiffs to establish the case they are alleging. Where such is the form of the pleading, it is not only not obligatory upon the defendants but it is not even permissible for them to proceed to put forward some affirmative case which they have not pleaded or alleged; and it is not, therefore, right that they should, by cross-examination of the plaintiffs or otherwise, suggest such an affirmative case.

> \[emphasis added\]

29     On appeal, the Court of Appeal agreed that a new case theory raised at the trial should be disregarded because it was not pleaded in the defence (_Khoo James and another v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 1024</span> at \[95\]). The appeal was nevertheless allowed on other grounds.

30      _Davie v New Merton Board_ was also approvingly cited in _Sundram v Arujunan_. The claimant in that case was injured in a motor accident comprising two sets of collisions. The first collision was with a motorcycle. As a result of the first collision, the claimant, who was riding a motorcycle, fell onto the road. He was then ran over by a motor car driven by the defendants, resulting in the second collision. In the action against the defendants involved in the second collision, the motorcyclist in the first collision was not joined as a co-defendant or called as a witness. At trial, the defendants contended that the head injury was caused by the first collision. Rejecting this contention, the majority held that it was too late for the defendants to raise this argument, having pleaded a denial of causation as regards the head injury. The majority found that the late contention took the claimant by surprise (at 369-370).

31     Though not raised by the Defendant, I have also considered the possibility of directing the Defendant to particularise the allegations on affidavit instead of amending his pleadings. In my view, such an approach would unfairly prejudice the Plaintiff in the present case. The Plaintiff had consented to entering interlocutory judgment on the basis of the Defendant’s pleaded case as it stood then, namely, a bare denial on the issue of causation. For him to now claim that a different motorist was responsible for the injuries, like Hayer J in _Davie v New Merton Board_, I accepted Mr Shegill’s submission that the Plaintiff would have had to seriously consider joining the other motorist as a co-defendant. This would allow the Plaintiff to seek contribution against the other motorist to the extent that the court finds that the injuries were caused by him. But the Plaintiff is now precluded from joining the other motorist to this action, for as long as the Interlocutory Judgment stands. Mr Shegill also submitted that any claim for personal injuries against the other motorist, if pursued now, would necessarily have been time-barred, given that three years have passed since the accident (s 24A of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, Rev Ed 1996). All of these are reasons why it was inappropriate to admit the further evidence without the Defendant first amending his pleadings.

32     Ms Leow urged me to consider the fact that the Interlocutory Judgment expressly reserved causation as an issue to be determined at the assessment of damages. While this is undoubtedly correct and plain from the express terms of the Interlocutory Judgment, it unfortunately tells only half the story. The _context_ in which parties entered an interlocutory judgment is just as important if not more so (_Arunachalam Balasubramanian v Lion City Rentals Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 33</span>). Parties agreed to enter interlocutory judgment on the basis of the Defendant’s pleaded case on causation. With the Defendant pleading a bare denial, the Defendant is presumed to have implicitly agreed to litigate the issue without leading evidence at the assessment of damages hearing, leaving the Plaintiff to prove his case. It was on that premise that the Plaintiff entered consent interlocutory judgment. Put another way, there is no evidence that the Plaintiff would have agreed to enter consent interlocutory judgment had the Defendant pleaded the involvement of another causative agent. In fact, Mr Shegill suggested that the Plaintiff would have done otherwise. In these circumstances, admitting the fresh evidence at this stage risks unravelling that contractual bargain. The fresh allegation changes the complexion of the assessment of damages as laid down by the Interlocutory Judgment. The Plaintiff will be potentially deprived of his right to join the other motorist as a co-defendant to this action. This is a form of prejudice that cannot be compensated in costs.

33     As I have alluded at the start of this decision, the Defendant relied on _Auto Clean_ as authority for his application to adduce the fresh evidence. While the Court of Appeal did say that courts should grant leave to adduce fresh evidence even after the court timelines issued pursuant to a summons for directions had lapsed in order to ensure all relevant issues are ventilated at trial, this principle is not without limitations. At least two criteria can be gleaned from the decision:

> (a)     a party seeking to persuade the court to exercise its discretionary power “must provide adequate information” (at \[16\]); and

> (b)     the respondent should not be irreparably prejudiced by the delay. On the facts, the court allowed the application because the “proceedings are still at a relatively early stage and no prejudice would be caused … \[i\]n particular, the action had not even been set down for trial” (at \[18\]).

34     It was plain to me that neither of these criteria was satisfied in the present case. The Defendant furnished no material to move this court’s discretion. Further, unlike _Auto Clean_ where the evidence was sought to be adduced before the set down of trial, the present matter has already obtained consent interlocutory judgment, and the evidence was being adduced at the doorstep of the assessment of damages. The Defendant cited _Malayan Banking Bhd v United Arab Shipping Co (S.A.G.) and Another (Agrizala Co (Pte) Ltd, Third Party) and Another Suit_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 214</span> as an instance where the court allowed further evidence to be led at the assessment of damages. But it is significant that the court in that case did not take issue with the evidence exceeding the scope of the pleaded case. That the fresh evidence in this case traversed material facts which should have been pleaded but were not ultimately presented an insurmountable hurdle for the Defendant. Introducing the evidence without a prior amendment to the pleadings would prejudice the Plaintiff for the reasons stated in this decision.

## Conclusion

35     I said above that pleadings represent the boundary lines of a legal battleground. The Defendant’s application to adduce further evidence at this late juncture – without explanation and in breach of his pleaded case – was plainly an unjustified attempt to redraw the boundaries of the present battleground. For the reasons stated above, I dismissed the application. I ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff costs of the application fixed in the sum of $1,500 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed if not fixed. While parties were brief with their written submissions and had collectively tendered only five legal authorities, the hearing nevertheless lasted almost two hours and had consumed much of the half-day hearing slot allotted to the assessment of damages hearing.
