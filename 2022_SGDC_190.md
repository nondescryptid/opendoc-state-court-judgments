INSURANCE – accident insurance

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 21/2022.\]

23 August 2022

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       This suit arose out of an unfortunate accident involving a foreign construction worker by the name of Veeraiah Selvam (“the deceased”) who was killed soon after he and his co-workers had finished their road repair works for the day. The road repair site was located at the West Coast Highway.

2       After the trial, I found that the deceased was blameless for his own death which meant that there was no liability attributable to the deceased. I found that the defendant and the third parties were liable in that the defendant was to bear 80% liability with the third parties bearing 20% liability. However, the plaintiff did not claim liability against the defendant for liability attributable to the third parties. I decided that under section 18(2) of the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), the plaintiff could only claim 80% which meant that the plaintiff was awarded judgment for $93,503.20 (80% of $116,879) with the usual interest at 5.33% pa thereon plus costs and disbursements. I ordered that the third parties were to indemnify the defendant the sum of $18,700.64 (20% of $93,503.20) with the usual interest at 5.33% pa thereon. Costs and disbursements were awarded and apportioned accordingly between the defendant and third parties. Being dissatisfied, the third parties have since appealed against my decision. I shall now elaborate on the grounds of my decision.

## Facts

### The parties

3       On 22 December 2017, the deceased and his co-workers were deployed to conduct road repair works along West Coast Highway. After these works were completed, the deceased was in the midst of boarding the lorry YP 7479B to leave the worksite when the defendant’s lorry YP 8204X collided into a truck XD 1751D, a traffic mounted attenuator (“TMA truck”) such that the TMA truck moved forward to collide into the deceased thereby resulting in the death of the deceased.

4       The plaintiff was the work injury compensation insurer of Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) which were the main contractors for the road maintenance contract for SouthWest sector along West Coast Highway. LTA subcontracted the works to the first third party Double-Trans Pte Ltd (“Double-Trans”). Double-Trans subcontracted part of the works to the second third party Samco Civil Engineering Pte Ltd (“Samco”) who were the employers of the deceased. At the material time, the defendant was the authorised river of the defendant’s lorry YP 8204X.

5       Following the deceased’s death, his family made a claim under the Act against Samco. On 2 November 2018, the plaintiff paid the sum of $116,879 to the deceased’s family pursuant to Notice of Assessment in Case No. W-20171201261 dated 16 October 2018 as the Assistant Commissioner had assessed the compensation payable by Samco to be for this amount. The plaintiff made the payment of this amount as the Work Injury Compensation insurer of LTA because the policy covered all sub-contractors in any tier.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

6       The plaintiff’s pleaded case was that while the deceased was in the midst of boarding the lorry YP 7479B to leave the work site, the defendant’s lorry YP 8204X had collided into the TMA truck, causing the TMA truck to move forward to collide into the deceased. This resulted in the deceased’s demise. Hence, the accident was caused by the defendant driving his lorry negligently.

7       Having made the payment of $116,879 to the deceased’s family, the plaintiff commenced the present suit to claim this amount from the defendant as the plaintiff took the position that they were entitled to be indemnified under section 18(1)(b) and section 18(2) of the Act. In short, as the plaintiff blamed the defendant for causing the accident, it filed the Writ of Summons on 3 September 2019 against the defendant for the sum of $116,879.

### The defendant’s version

8       According to the defendant, he was driving his lorry along West Coast Highway when he noticed a TMA truck was in front on the same lane that he was travelling on. He did not realize that the TMA truck was stationary until his lorry was near the TMA truck. The defendant stepped on his brakes immediately but was unable to avoid a collision with the TMA truck.

9       The defendant contended that he did not see anyone diverting traffic along the road and there were no safety cones. The signal/hazard light/blinker light/arrow board on the TMA truck were not switched on. The safety barrier in the TMA truck was lifted up or was deactivated at the material time. Hence, he did not realize that the TMA truck was stationary. It was only after he emerged from his lorry after the accident that he realized that the TMA truck had surged forward after the collision and hit the deceased.

10     In \[8\] to \[12\] of the defence[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1), the defendant attributed the accident vicariously to the negligence of third parties and their two employees being Gnanasekaran Satheesh Kumar (“Satheesh”) who drove the TMA truck and the driver of the lorry YP 7479B in front of the TMA truck by the name of Chandrasekar Sureshkumar (“Sureshkumar”). Further and in the alternative, in \[13\] of the defence, the defendant also attributed blame to the deceased and the particulars of such alleged negligence were pleaded in \[13\] a to v. The defendant also included the third parties into the suit such that should the defendant be found liable, he was entitled to an indemnity from the third parties.

### The third parties’ version

11     At \[3\] of Double-Trans’ defence against the defendant’s claim against it, they acknowledged that they were the owners of both the TMA truck and YP 7479B. Double-Trans blamed the defendant entirely for causing the accident by his negligent driving, control and management of his lorry YP 8204X.

12     Further, the defendant was charged and convicted under section 304(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide to which he pleaded guilty on 31 March 2019. On this basis, Double-Trans denied liability for having to indemnify the defendant in the event that the plaintiff succeeded in its claim.

13     In Samco’s defence against the defendant’s claim against it, Samco also took the same position as Double-Trans. Both defences pleaded by Double-Trans and Samco were similar.

## Issues to be determined

14     The issues before the court were as follows:

> Issue 1- Did the deceased contribute to his own death?

> Issue 2- Was the defendant liable?

> Issue 3- Were the third parties liable for contributory negligence?

> Issue 4- What was the apportionment of liability between the defendant and the third parties?

## Decision of the court

16     The relevant provisions in the Act are reproduced below:

> **Remedies both against employer and third party**

> 18.-(1)    Where any injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer (referred to in this section as the third party) to pay damages in respect of-

>> (a)    the employee may take proceedings against the third party to recover damages and may claim against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act, but he shall not be entitled to recover both damages and compensation; and

>> (b)    if the employee has recovered compensation under this Act, the person by whom the compensation was paid, and any person who has been called upon to pay an indemnity under section 17(3), shall be entitled to be indemnified by the third party so liable to pay damages as aforesaid.

> (2)    Where any injury is caused to an employee by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment under circumstances which give a right to recover reduced damages in respect thereof from a third party by virtue of any wilful act or negligence of the employer or employee, any right conferred by subsection (1) on-

>> (a)    the person by whom any compensation under this Act was paid; and

>> (b)    any person who has been called upon to pay an indemnity under section 17(3),

> to be indemnified by the third party shall be limited to a right to be indemnified in respect of such part only of the total compensation paid or payable in such proportion as the court may determine as is appropriate to the degree to which the injury was attributable to the act, default or negligence of the third party.

## Issue 1- Did the deceased contribute to his own death?

17     I found that the deceased did not contribute to his own death. The evidence of the defendant in the witness stand during cross-examination was that the accident was not the fault of the deceased. Instead, he blamed the third parties for the accident and even conceded during cross-examination that he was partially at fault. My finding that the deceased did not contribute to his own death was justified given the defendant’s testimony in court.

18     Based on the facts of the case, I did not find that the deceased had contributed to his own death as he was merely climbing into the lorry after finishing his work and unfortunately, through no fault of his own, he was the last worker to climb into the lorry and before he could climb fully into the lorry, the accident occurred. I found that there was no sufficient evidence before the court to support the particulars of the deceased’s alleged negligence as pleaded in para 13 a to v of the defence. Therefore, I made the finding that no liability ought to be attributed to the deceased.

## Issue 2- Was the defendant liable?

19     I found that the defendant contributed to the accident as he had pleaded guilty to the criminal charge[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) preferred by the prosecution under section 304A(b) of the Penal Code for negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide for failure to keep a proper lookout ahead and collided into the rear of the TMA truck resulting in the latter surging forward and colliding into the deceased. In the Statement of Facts which he admitted to at the time of his conviction at \[10\][^3], the defendant admitted that he saw that the vehicles in front of him were all changing lanes. This was consistent with his evidence in court when he testified that he saw vehicles in front of him change lanes. It was also stated in the Statement of Facts that the defendant did not slow down and proceeded at normal speed. He also admitted at \[12\] of the Statement of Facts that there was no mechanical fault with his lorry, the weather was fine and the road surface was dry.

20     The defendant testified that he was aware that he was ferrying a heavy load in that he was ferrying 4 tonnes of meat at that time. As a professional driver, he would have known that since he was carrying a heavy load, he would require more time and distance to slow down or take evasive action. In \[10\] of his AEIC, he acknowledged that he was carrying a heavy load[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). He also testified in court as well as in \[7\] of his AEIC that he was travelling downslope. In the circumstances, the defendant ought to have slowed down his lorry and taken necessary evasive action when he saw vehicles in front of his lorry changing lanes as actions of these fellow motorists in front of him suggested that there was road obstruction ahead. Yet he did not take such evasive action but merely jammed his brakes when he saw the stationary TMA truck when he was about 3 car lengths away.

21     The defendant’s position was that his speed of his lorry was already “locked” by the LTA to prevent his lorry from travelling above 60km/h. I found that he was not speeding as this was not borne out in the criminal charge nor proven by the plaintiff or the third parties. However, I found that he was still liable for the accident for the reasons as mentioned earlier. As rightly pointed out by the plaintiff’s counsel in his closing submissions at \[46\] to \[52\], what is the reasonable speed of a vehicle is dependent on facts and circumstances of the road at that point in time as the vehicle driver’s duty to travel at a reasonable speed is linked to the duty to keep a proper lookout. The fact that the driver kept within his speed limit did not automatically mean that he was not negligent as established in _Goh Yang Hui (committee of the person and estate of Chua Jie Liang Samuel, mentally disordered) v Soon Teck Soon_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 67</span>.

## Issue 3- Were the third parties liable for contributory negligence?

22     It was undisputed that Sureshkumar has since returned to his home country, India as stated in \[15\] of Toh Kok Weng Benjamin’s AEIC[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5). He did not affirm an AEIC nor attended court to testify. Although his evidence would have been relevant and material, the court did not have benefit of his AEIC evidence and oral testimony as Sureshkumar’s evidence was not obtained.

23     On the last day of trial, a certificate was produced[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) to show that Satheesh had received training to operate the TMA truck. According to the administration manager of the third parties, this document was produced after Satheesh informed him that the defendant’s counsel had enquired about Satheesh’s training. I accepted that there was no deliberate concealment as such a certificate would have been favourable for the third parties to produce to refute allegations of negligence in allowing an untrained worker to work on site.

24     According to \[9\] of the Statement of Facts[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7), there was no one diverting traffic along the road, no safety cones, signal/ hazard lights /arrow board on the TMA truck were not switched on and the safety barrier had been lifted. In the defendant’s police report[^8], he also stated in this contemporaneous document that there was no one marshalling the road, no safety cones and safety barriers were lifted up.

25     As stated in \[11\] of Satheesh’s AEIC[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9), I found that the safety crash barrier of the TMA truck was lifted up at the time of the accident as Satheesh was given the understanding that all workers had boarded the lorry to be transported off site. However, the dispute was on whether the hazard lights and amber rotating lamps remained switched on.

26     I found that there was negligence on the part of the third parties as Satheesh had deactivated the safety crash barrier without ensuring that all workers were safely on board the lorry before such de-activation. As for the hazard lights and rotating lamps, there was conflicting evidence as to whether these were switched on. I was unable to determine with certainty whether these were indeed switched on. However, I agreed with the defendant’s position that even if these were switched on, they could have been concealed from sight of the motorists because the safety barrier when lifted up would block the view based on the picture of the TMA truck in the accident photos.

27     The defendant made the assertion that had the safety barrier remained activated, it would have absorbed the impact and the deceased would not have died. I was unable to determine with certainty whether in the event that the safety barrier weas not deactivated, it would have fully absorbed the impact of the defendant’s lorry hitting the truck such that the deceased would not have died. I was of the view that such determination would be possible if there was expert evidence available to make such a finding. Although I was unable to make such a definitive finding, the possibility that safety crash barrier if activated would have prevented the death of the deceased or at the very least lessened the impact of the collision existed. If the impact of the collision was lessened, there was a possibility that the deceased might not have died and instead, suffered some injuries.

28     The third parties submitted that the Code of Practice for Traffic Control at Work Zone exhibited (“Code of Practice”)[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) was merely a recommended course of practice and did not impose any strict legal obligation[^11]. The High Court decision of _Tan Bee Hock v FG Builders Pte Ltd (United Overseas Insurance Ltd, third party_) \[2016\] 2 SLR (R) 940 was cited. Although I accepted that the Code of Practice was not meant to impose strict legal obligations and did not impose statutory duties, non-compliance with this Code of Practice could and did result in devasting consequences such as death of a construction worker in this instance.

29     In the present suit, the Code of Practice provides guidance as to what safe and best practices are during road construction/road repair works. I found there were instances of non compliance of the Code by the third parties which I shall elaborate later. The third parties owed a duty to take reasonable care when conducting road repair works. Although non-compliance or breach of the Code was not a statutory breach, it was negligent of the third parties and their servants and agents not to comply with the Code which outlined the safe and best practices when conducting road repair works. Therefore, I disagreed with the third parties that no or little weight should be placed on their alleged breach.

30     The third parties were vicariously negligent as Sureshkumar had not complied with the Code of Practice which required a longitudinal buffer distance of 15 to 30 metres when the TMA truck was stationary and mobile respectively. Sureshkumar had maintained only a buffer of 4-5 metres. Out of ease and convenience of removing the cones, Sureshkumar had shortened the buffer distance which was against the Code of Practice.

31     I found that there were safety lapses such as deactivating the safety barrier before ensuring all workers were safely on board the lorry and reducing the buffer distance in violation of the Code of Practice. Therefore, I found the third parties vicariously liable for the acts of their employees. Toh Kok Weng Benjamin also testified during cross examination that MOM had imposed fines on the third party companies as a result of the accident. This suggested that the third parties were somewhat liable for the accident, possibly due to the safety lapses.

32     I took the position that it was a chain collision and there was no _novus actus interveniens_. The defendant had submitted that there was a _novus actus interveniens_ but as rightly pointed out by the third parties in their reply submissions, this defence by the defendant was not pleaded. [\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) In _Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric_ \[2007\] 3 SLR ( R) 782 (“ Sunny Metal”), the Court of Appeal held that to establish causation, there is a physical connection between the defendant’s wrong and the claimant’s damage and whether the defendant’s wrongful conduct constituted the “legal cause” of the damage.

33     I was of the view that the plaintiff had established causation as required under the Sunny Metal case. In the present suit, the defendant collided into the TMA truck which in turn collided into the deceased and thereby causing his death. There was no break in the chain of events. In my view, both the defendant and the third parties formed the chain of events that caused and resulted in the demise of the deceased.

## Issue 4- What was the apportionment of liability between the defendant and the third parties?

34     As stated earlier, I found both the defendant and third parties liable. The remaining question was of apportionment of liability between these parties.

35     In the third parties’ internal Workplace Safety & Health Committee Report[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13), there were 3 comments in part 4 of the report. The analysis was that it was the recklessness of the defendant driver, failure of the defendant failed to slow down and switch lanes and driving recklessly and hitting stationary vehicle from the back as the main causes of the accident. I saw no reason to disagree with the analysis that the main cause was attributable to the defendant. Also, in the _Motor Accident Guide_ (State Courts, 2014) for front to rear collision scenario, the rear vehicle which was driven by the defendant in the instant case, the defendant would bear the bulk of the liability up to 90% liability. However, as the third parties also breached safety practices, it would only be fair to adjust the apportionment of liability accordingly. I found that it would be fair to apportion liability as the defendant bearing 80% liability with the third parties bearing 20% liability.

36     As stated earlier, the plaintiff’s suit was against the defendant and since I found the defendant 80% liable, the defendant was to pay 80% of sum claimed which amounted to $93,503.20 (80% of $116,879) as provided under section 18(1) of the Act. Although section 18(1) of the Act confers a right on the person by whom compensation was paid which meant that the plaintiff was to seek indemnity from a person other than the employer also known as the third party which would be the defendant, section 18 (2) of the Act limits this right such that the plaintiff can only recover such part of the total compensation paid that is attributable to the act, default or negligence of the third party.

37     As with all third party proceedings where the defendant seeks indemnity against a third party, when the court finds the third party liable, the third party is liable to indemnify the defendant to the extent to which the court finds the third party liable for. On this basis, as I had also attributed 20 % liability against the third parties, I ordered that the third parties were to indemnify the defendant for 20% liability which amounted to $18,700.64 (20% of $93,503.20).

## Conclusion

38     For the above reasons, I granted partial judgment in favour of the plaintiff with apportionment of liability between the defendant and the third parties as outlined earlier. After hearing parties on their submissions relating to costs and disbursements, I fixed the costs and disbursements accordingly.
