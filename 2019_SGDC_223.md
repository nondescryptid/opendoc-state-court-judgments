Civil Procedure – Garnishee orders

31 October 2019

### District Judge Thian Yee Sze:

## Introduction

1       This appeal arose out of garnishee proceedings taken out by the Plaintiff (“EOM”), the judgment creditor in this action, for debts due or accruing due from the Garnishee (“Buildtech”) to the Defendant (“Axion”), the judgment debtor in this action, to be paid to the Plaintiff. The Provisional Garnishee Order (“PGO”) (previously known as the Garnishee Order _Nisi_) was obtained on 5 July 2017. The question before me was whether I should discharge the PGO following a series of events which took place after the PGO was granted or if I should uphold an earlier order by the Deputy Registrar for a trial to be held to determine if Buildtech owed any debt to Axion at the time the PGO was granted. Specifically, after the date of the PGO, Buildtech obtained a default judgment against Axion for a sum which was in excess of the amount it might have owed Axion, with the practical consequence that there was no longer any sum owed by them to Axion.

2       At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal before me, I allowed Buildtech’s appeal and discharged the PGO pursuant to Order 49, rule 5 of the Rules of Court. These are the grounds of my decision.

## Background

3       EOM commenced an action against Axion for sums owed for goods supplied and serviced rendered by EOM in relation to construction works. EOM obtained a judgment in default of Axion’s appearance in the action for $184,144.37 and interest on the judgment sum. EOM then sought to enforce the judgment through various enforcement proceedings, including commencing garnishee proceedings against other parties. Unfortunately, none of these efforts bore fruit and the PGOs were discharged as there were no monies owing from these other parties. There were also hearings held to examine the officers of Axion and documents obtained pursuant to an order obtained by EOM.

4       The one enforcement proceeding which EOM continued to pursue was that vis-à-vis Buildtech in DC/SUM 1860/2017. Pursuant to the PGO obtained on 5 July 2017, parties attended before the Deputy Registrar for the “show cause” hearing on 5 January 2018. Buildtech’s position as set out in their affidavit was that whatever sums Buildtech owed Axion for plumbing, sanitary and other works carried out and supplies provided in relation to a number of construction projects were more than offset by the sums Axion owed Buildtech in the form of back charges arising out of these projects. I should add that Buildtech had not commenced legal proceedings in respect of the back charges at this point in time. EOM disputed this, arguing that Axion did not agree to the back charges. In view of the factual disputes, the Deputy Registrar decided that the issue of Axion’s liablity for the back charges could not be summarily determined, and ordered that there be a trial to determine whether there was any debt due or accruing due from Buildtech to Axion at the time the PGO was served.

5       On 28 February 2018, a few weeks after the Deputy Registrar’s order, Buildtech brought an action in DC/DC 619/2018 to claim from Axion the back charges mentioned in paragraph 4 totalling $157,787.48. On 15 March 2018, after Axion failed to enter an appearance to challenge the claim, Buildtech obtained a judgment for that sum.

6       Seven months later, EOM filed an application (DC/SUM 3628/2018) for the trial ordered in January to be adjourned _sine die_ on the basis that Axion had filed a police report stating that the claim by Buildtech against it for which a default judgment had been obtained was a false one, and that the garnishee proceedings should be stayed until “such time the claim to (_sic_) is found to have been false by the authorities and Default Judgment to have been falsely entered”[^1]. Buildtech in turn filed an application (DC/SUM/4171/2018) for the garnishee proceedings for which a trial had been earlier ordered in DC/SUM 1860/2017 to be dismissed or struck out for want of prosecution or pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The key plank of Buildtech’s arguments was that the sum owed by Axion to them (and for which the default judgment had been obtained in DC/DC 619/2018) was larger than what was allegedly owed by Buildtech to Axion and hence operated as a set-off against the latter claim. They added that it had been more than one year since garnishee proceedings were initiated against them, and EOM should move forward towards a trial instead of seeking an adjournment for an indefinite period. The Deputy Registrar dismissed both applications. In this regard, the Deputy Registrar took the view that the fact of the default judgment represented “new facts which should have no potential material adverse effects on Plaintiff’s (EOM) case regarding whether there was a debt due or accruing due _at the time the PGO was served_ (_emphasis mine_)[^2].” The Deputy Registrar then gave fresh directions for the filing of affidavits and other consequential orders for the trial in DC/SUM 1860/2017 as the earlier timelines had lapsed. Buildtech appealed against the Deputy Registrar’s decision.

## The issue in the appeal

7       The appeal against the Deputy Registrar’s decision to dismiss Buildtech’s application and to give various directions for the continuation of the garnishee proceedings turned on whether the PGO should be discharged. If there was a discharge, those directions would no longer be necessary and would fall away.

8       As it was not made clear in its Notice of Appeal, the court sought clarification on the orders which Buildtech was seeking in this Registrar’s Appeal. Buildtech clarified in its written submissions dated 11 July 2019 that it was seeking a discharge of the PGO pursuant to either the inherent powers of the court or Order 49, rule 5 of the Rules of Court.

9       The starting point in the inquiry was whether there was “any debt due or accruing due to the judgment debtor from the garnishee” under Order 49, rule 1. If there was, the court may “order the garnishee to pay the judgment creditor” that amount or as much as was sufficient to satisfy the judgment or order of the judgment creditor. The procedure for the attachment of any debt so due is set out in Order 49, rule 1(2). To this end, the PGO was obtained on 5 July 2017, as I earlier mentioned.

10     Whether there is a debt due or accruing due under Order 49, r 1 is to be determined at the date the PGO was granted – see _CIC Video International v Forward International Singapore Pte Ltd and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 15</span> and section 49/1/4 of the Singapore Court Practice 2017. Any debt which is due after the that date would hence not be attachable.

11     In this case, while there was no allegation that the PGO was improperly obtained on the basis that there was no debt due or accruing due at the relevant point in time, Buildtech’s argument was that events which transpired after the obtaining and service of the PGO, and in fact, after the order for a trial on 5 January 2018, rendered it such that the court should discharge the PGO. The new facts which emerged after 5 January 2018 were the commencement of the action in DC/DC 619/2018 for the back charges due from Axion to Buildtech and the obtaining of a judgment in default of Axion’s appearance on 15 March 2018.

12     The issue before me was whether these events which transpired after 5 January 2018 justified the discharge of the PGO.

## The legal analysis

13     The court’s power to make a garnishee order, whether provisional or final, is a discretionary one. As the High Court made clear in _Commercial Bank of Kuwait SAK v Nair (Chase Manhattan Bank NA, garnishee)_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] SGHC 248</span> at \[18\]:

> It should be noted that this rule (ie Order 49, rule 1(1)) provides that the court “may” make a garnishee order. The court’s power to make a garnishee order, whether it is an order _nisi_ or an order absolute, is discretionary. A garnishee order is basically an equitable remedy, and it may be refused where the attachment of the debt would be inequitable or unfair.

14     In _Chase Manhattan Bank_, the High Court had to decide if it should exercise its discretion to make a garnishee order absolute in the circumstances of that case. In determining this, the court considered seven principles listed by the High Court in _Asia Commercial Finance Ltd v Udai_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] SGHC 116</span> at \[14\] when deciding whether to make a charge _nisi_ absolute, and which the court in _Chase Manhattan Bank_ accepted would likewise apply when exercising the court’s discretion in respect of garnishee orders.

15     The relevant principles laid down in _Asia Commercial Finance_ for the purposes of the appeal before me were as follows:

> (a)     The question whether a garnishee order _nisi_ should be made absolute is one for the discretion of the court.

> (b)     In exercising its discretion the court has both the right and the duty to take into account all the circumstances of any particular case, _whether such circumstances arose before or after the making of the order nisi_ (_emphasis mine_).

> (c)     The court should so exercise its discretion as to do equity, so far as possible, to all the various parties involved, that is to say the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor, and all other unsecured creditors.

16     I would add to the non-exhaustive list of principles another consideration: the impecuniosity or insolvency of the judgment debtor. This is because when the PGO is made absolute, this would result in the unsecured judgment creditor in that case being given a significant advantage over all the other unsecured creditors by having the debt due to him “secured” or satisfied through the garnishee order absolute.

## The decision on the exercise of discretion

17     Having regard the above principles, it was evident that the PGO should not continue to stand for the following reasons which, taken together, would warrant a discharge of the PGO.

18     First, the default judgment obtained by Buildtech against Axion, which had not been set aside and was for all intent and purposes a valid and binding one, was for a sum that extinguished what Buildtech allegedly owed Axion. According to the affidavit of one of the directors of EOM, Khor Tian Soon, dated 25 May 2017[^3] filed in support of EOM’s application for the PGO, the sum which Buildtech owed Axion was $112,402.21. In a later affidavit dated 13 December 2017 filed in support of EOM’s position in the garnishee proceedings[^4], Sng Yong Sheng, a director of Axion, stated that the sum which Buildtech owed Axion was $127,368.30, and that after deducting the sum of $11,810.88 which Axion accepted it owed Buildtech, the balance due to Axion was $115,557.42.

19     Second, Buildtech would have been prejudiced if it paid out to EOM the sum attached pursuant to the PGO given the fact that there was clear evidence that Axion was not in a financial position to fulfil the default judgment of $157,787.48 which Buildtech had obtained against Axion. The default judgment sum was larger than the sum which EOM claimed was owed by Buildtech to Axion. As counsel for EOM herself submitted at the hearing below before the Deputy Registrar:

> Axion is in no position to s/a JID. All directors are bankrupt. No one to give instructions to re setting aside. Directors don’t have money either.

> (Notes of Evidence dated 8 February 2019 at NE-6C).

20     This was similar to the situation in _United Integrated Services Pte Lt v Harmonious Coretrades Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 126</span> where the garnishee’s counterclaim against the judgment debtor was for a much higher amount than what was owed by the garnishee to the judgment debtor. In that context, Chan Seng Onn J held that when the garnishee had a corresponding counterclaim against an insolvent judgment debtor, “allowing the enforcement of the final garnishee order could have the effect of unduly favouring the judgment creditor at the expense of the garnishee should the judgment debtor later be subject to an insolvent winding up” (at \[46\]). As Chan J explained, this was because should it later be determined that the garnishee had a valid counterclaim against the judgment debtor, the judgment debtor may not be able to pay the counterclaim in full given its insolvency. The lack of equity between the positions of the judgment creditor and the garnishee would be very stark should the judgment debtor be wound up subsequently:

> If the judgment debtor then goes into an insolvent winding up, the garnishee would have to rank among unsecured creditors in the scheme of priorities, and may not have its counterclaim satisfied in full. Meanwhile, as the judgment creditor’s claim would have been satisfied in full by the garnishee order, the judgment creditor would not have to compete with other unsecured creditors. (at \[48\])

In the case before me, given Axion’s state of insolvency, should the PGO be made final, the advantage EOM would obtain over all other unsecured creditors, including Buildtech, would be have the effect of unduly favouring EOM at the expense of Buildtech, which not only had a counterclaim but had obtained a default judgment for the same.

21     Finally, in light of the fact that there was already a valid and enforceable default judgment for the back charges which was to form the subject matter of the trial between EOM and Buildtech, it would have been futile to expend further resources to determine this. In addition, even if EOM had succeeded in proving at the trial that Buildtech owed Axion monies for the provision of plumbing and related works and supplies, based on the calculations provided in the affidavits filed on behalf of EOM (see \[18\] above), this would have been extinguished by the default judgment sum granted in Buildtech’s favour. In this respect, the English case of _Hale v Victoria Plumbing Co Ltd and anor_ <span class="citation">\[1966\] 2 QB 746</span> was instructive. While that case was concerned essentially with whether there was a debt due or accruing due from the garnishee to the judgment debtor at the point in time when the garnishee order _nisi_ was made, it was pertinent to note that the Court of Appeal set aside the registrar’s order making the garnishee order final (i) solely on the basis of affidavit evidence on the debts owed by the judgment debtor to the garnishee and vice versa and (ii) even though no actions were filed in court to recover either of those alleged debts. In setting aside the registrar’s order, Dankwerts LJ opined thus:

> It seems to me to be contrary to justice and sense to order that a garnishee should pay out money which it appears probably will not be due from him at all – because no proceedings have been taken by the judgment debtor against the garnishee, any more than any proceedings have been taken by the garnishee against the judgment debtor. It seems contrary to justice that an order should be made for payment of moneys which on the face of it appear not likely to be due and which might perhaps be paid away irretrievably to a man or company who is in trouble.

22     That reasoning applied with equal force in the case before me, if not more. Here, proceedings had been taken by the garnishee, Buildtech, against the judgment debtor, Axion, for which a default judgment had been obtained and which was in excess of any debt it owed Axion. There was also ample evidence that Axion was a company in deep financial trouble and that any payment of money made by Buildtech to EOM pursuant to a garnishee order would “be paid away irretrievably”.

23     In summary, given (i) the fact that Buildtech had obtained a default judgment for a sum which was in excess of the amount it might have owed Axion, (ii) that there was clear evidence that Axion was insolvent and was not in a financial position to fulfil the default judgment which Buildtech had obtained against Axion, and (iii) the futility of expending further resources to determine if Buildtech owed Axion any money since whatever sum which could be proved to be owed through trial would be less than what Axion owed Buildtech by way of the default judgment, I ordered the discharge of the PGO.

24     In light of the reasons for coming to my decision, it was not necessary to deal with the other remaining arguments relating to issue estoppel or the issues of set-off and merger in respect of the default judgment obtained by Buildtech as they were not relevant to the determination of the matter. For the avoidance of doubt, my decision rested not on the fact that there was a set-off by virtue of the default judgment, which was the key plank of the Buildtech’s submissions, but upon a consideration of all the circumstances of the case enunciated in the foregoing paragraphs, including events which arose after the granting of the PGO.

25     Finally, I noted that the Deputy Registrar below did not have the benefit of the submissions on the legal principles and propositions set out in the case authorities placed before me. In the circumstances, I did not make an order as to the cost of the appeal.
