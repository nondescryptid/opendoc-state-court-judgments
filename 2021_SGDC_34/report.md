Criminal Law – Misuse of Drugs Act – Offence of drug consumption

3 March 2021

### District Judge Soh Tze Bian:

## INTRODUCTION & CHARGE

1       The accused person, Ali Muddin Khan (“AP”), claimed trial to one drug consumption charge (punishable with a minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment and up to a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment, or $20,000 fine, or both) as follows:

>     “….that you, on or before 24 July 2019, in Singapore, did consume a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, 2-\[1-(4-Fluorobutyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the butyl group, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(i) of the said Act,

>     and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 27 June 2012 in State Court No 18, vide DAC 34919/2011, convicted of an offence of consumption of a specified drug, to wit, methamphetamine, under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and punished under section 33A(1) of the said Act with five years’ and six months’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under section 33(4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case on the proceeded charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the AP guilty and convicted him on the charge and sentenced him to the prescribed minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment.

## CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

3       To prove its case against the AP, the Prosecution called 8 witnesses. PW1 to PW8 as follows:

4       As stated in the prosecution submissions, its case is as follows:

> (a)     On 24 July 2019 at about 10.34 am, the AP was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) at his residence, Block 123 Yishun Street 11 #XXX, Singapore 760123, on suspicion of having consumed controlled drugs[^1].

> (b)     Following his arrest, the AP was brought to Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters, where he provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “C-SL-19- 93051-1 ALI MUDDIN KHAN SXXX” and “C-SL-19-93051-2 ALIMUDDIN KHAN SXXX” respectively in his presence[^2].

> (c)     On 25 July 2019, the said urine samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis[^3]. The urine samples first underwent a screening test (Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry), then a confirmatory test (Liquid Chromatography Quadropule Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry).[^4]

> (d)     Following the analysis, HSA analysts, PW6 and PW7, issued two certificates[^5] under s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act ( MDA) : one certificate issued by PW6 dated 1 August 2019, and another issued by PW7 dated 6 August 2019. Both certificates stated that the AP ’s urine samples were analysed and found to contain 2-\[1-(4-Fluorobutyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3 dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the butyl group (“the Drug”). The Drug is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

> (e)     The AP was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume the Drug. He has thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(i) of the MDA.

> (f)     Moreover, prior to the commission of the said offence, the AP was on 27 June 2012 in State Court No 18, vide DAC 34919/2011, convicted of an offence of consumption of a specified drug (methamphetamine) under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, and punished under s 33A(1) of the MDA with five years’ and six months’ imprisonment[^6]. His conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date. He is thus liable to be punished with not less than three years’ imprisonment, under s 33(4) of the MDA.

## APPLICABLE LEGISLATIVE PRESUMPTIONS

5       Under s 16 of the MDA, a certificate signed by a HSA analyst relating to a controlled drug or controlled substance, shall be admitted in evidence, in any proceedings for an offence under the MDA, on its production by the prosecution without proof of signature and, until the contrary is proved, shall be proof of all matters contained therein.

6       Section 22 of the MDA provides that if any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted in accordance with the procedures as prescribed under the MDA and the regulations made thereunder, he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of s 8(b)(i) of the MDA.

## ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION

7       There were 2 issues for my determination:

> (i)     With the presumptive proof of the HSA certificates of the matters as stated therein under s 16 of the MDA and the evidence adduced by the prosecution, whether the presumption under s 22 of the MDA has been triggered with the s 8(b)(i) offence under the MDA been proven by the prosecution ?; and

> (ii)     If the presumption under s 22 of the MDA has been triggered and the MDA offence has been proven by the prosecution, whether the AP has rebutted this presumption on a balance of probabilities based on his testimony as well as other evidence adduced at the trial?

## CLOSE OF THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

8       At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that there was some evidence not inherently incredible which satisfied each and every element of the charge in DAC-927299-2019. Accordingly, I administered the standard allocution to the AP who elected to give evidence in his own defence to the aforesaid charge and he has no other witness.

## ASSESSMENT OF EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY BOTH PARTIES

#### Case for the Defence

9       Based on the AP’s cautioned statement[^7] and his testimony at the trial, his defence is a bare denial, coupled with totally unsubstantiated allegations that other unnamed persons had somehow contaminated his urine sample or “spiked” his tobacco or drink.

#### Credibility and testimony of PWs remained unshaken

10     Based on the totality of the evidence before me at the close of the defence, I found the defence cross-examination of all the prosecution witnesses (except PW2, PW4, PW6 and PW8 for whom there was no cross-examination by the defence) and the AP’s own testimony given in his own defence had failed to undermine the credibility and evidence of the prosecution witnesses which remained unshaken, and none of them was shown to have any motive or reason to frame or implicate the AP. I also rejected the AP’s claim that he did not take or consume any drug and the positive urine test result was due to either contamination of his urine sample, or his tobacco been spiked, by unnamed persons as the AP was not able to show any evidence in this regard.

#### Issue (i)

11     On issue (i), I am of the view that with the presumptive proof of the HSA certificates of the matters as stated therein under s 16 of the MDA, the statutory presumption under s 22 of the MDA has been triggered and the s 8(b)(i) offence under the MDA has been proven by the prosecution based on the prosecution evidence and submissions which I agreed as follows:

> (a)     The prosecution evidence established that the Drug was found in the AP’s urine. The testimony of the CNB officers (PW1, PW3 and PW4) showed that the AP’s urine was procured, collected and delivered to HSA in accordance with the procedures set out in s 31(4) of the MDA[^8] read with the First and Second Schedules[^9] to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 6, 1999 Ed). In particular:

>> (i)       The AP first washed his hands at the direction of the escorting officer, PW1.[^10]

>> (ii)       The AP then chose one prepacked red master bottle and two prepacked blue smaller bottles from a cabinet containing at least 10 master bottles and at least 20 smaller bottles.[^11]

>> (iii)       PW1 escorted the AP to the toilet and instructed him to open the master bottle. The AP then urinated into the master bottle. PW1 observed the AP urinating into the master bottle and ensured that nothing entered the master bottle apart from the AP’s urine.[^12]

>> (iv)       The AP provided more than 80ml of urine into the master bottle. As instructed by PW1, the AP then poured urine from the master bottle into each of the two smaller bottles (more than 30ml into each of the smaller bottles), with some urine remaining in the master bottle.[^13]

>> (v)       PW1 then temporarily sealed the two smaller bottles containing the AP’s urine with masking tape and placed them inside a clear plastic bag bearing the AP’s name and particulars. The plastic bag containing the bottles was passed to the AP and he held onto it.[^14]

>> (vi)       PW1 then used a dropper to siphon the remaining urine in the master bottle into a test tube for the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”). PW1 passed the test tube to PW3 who was the IUT operator. The master bottle was then discarded by the AP.[^15]

>> (vii)       After the IUT result had been generated, PW1 sealed the two smaller bottles in the AP ’s presence. After checking for leakage, PW1 sealed the bottles with labels printed with the AP ’s name and NRIC number. PW1 verified these particulars with the AP, who signed on the labels.[^16]

>> (viii)       The AP then deposited the two smaller bottles into two metal boxes which were locked at all times, by pushing each bottle through a hole in each metal box. After ensuring that the two smaller bottles had been properly deposited into the metal boxes, PW1 placed the metal boxes in a refrigerator, which he then locked with a key.[^17]

>> (ix)       PW4 delivered the AP ’s urine samples to the HSA on 25 July 2019. After she delivered them to the HSA, the HSA counter staff used a key to unlock the two metal boxes and took custody of the urine samples. The empty metal boxes were then relocked and returned to PW4.[^18]

> (b)     The AP expressed no complaints during the urine procurement process[^19] and did not challenge any part of this process during the trial.

> (c)     The AP’s urine samples were analysed by HSA analysts, PW6 and PW7, pursuant to s 31(4)(b) of the MDA. On 1 and 6 August 2019, they issued two certificates[^20] bearing Lab Nos. AT-1933-06535-002-11 and AT-1933-06535-001-11 pursuant to s 16 of the MDA, stating that the urine samples analysed were found to contain the Drug.

> (d)     At the trial, the HSA analysts, PW6 and PW7, explained that the Drug – which can also be known by the slightly shorter name “4-Fluoro-MDMB-BINACA ester hydrolysis metabolite or its isomers”[^21] – is one of many new psychoactive substances (“**NPS**”). NPS are compounds manufactured in a laboratory to mimic the effects of common controlled drugs such as cannabis and methamphetamine, for example by producing a feeling of relaxation or euphoria[^22]. The Drug in particular was a synthetic cannabinoid, meaning that it was intended to mimic the effects of cannabis.[^23]

> (e)     PW5 had also testified from his operational experience that NPS were manufactured in laboratories and synthetic in nature, and could be known by street names like “mushroom”, “mush” and “K2”. Such drugs would typically be consumed by smoking.[^24] This was supported by HSA analyst, PW7, who said that to her knowledge, consumers would usually spray a liquid form of the drug onto vegetable matter, then smoke it like they would smoke a cigarette.[^25]

> (f)     PW3, PW5, PW6 and PW7 had also explained at the trial that the IUT conducted at the CNB office was unable to detect the presence of NPS as it did not have the correct reagent, which explained why the IUT result was negative despite the presence of NPS in the AP’s urine.[^26]

> (g)     As for what could have caused the presence of the Drug in the AP’s urine, the HSA analysts, PW6 and PW7, explained that it could have resulted from consuming the parent drug 4-Fluoro-MDMB-BINACA – also a synthetic cannabinoid.[^27] They did not know of any other causes, besides consuming a synthetic cannabinoid, which could have given rise to the Drug in the AP’s urine.[^28] No medications prescribed in Singapore could have given rise to the Drug in the AP’s urine.[^29] The drugs which the AP had been prescribed by Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on 2 and 15 July 2019 – namely, diclofenac, famotidine, cephalexin, paracetamol, tramadol and metoclopramide[^30]– could not account for the presence of the Drug in his urine.

> (h)     The HSA certificates are presumptive proof of the matters they set out unless the defence is able to disprove them[^31]. The onus thus falls on the AP to prove that the matters contained in the certificates are inaccurate and/or should not be relied upon. The AP has not done so here. The HSA certificates therefore proved, as a fact, that the AP ’s urine contained the Drug.

> (i)     Given that the urine tests were conducted in accordance with s 31(4) of the MDA, the statutory presumption under s 22 of the MDA therefore applied to the present case. Both the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_ elements of the offence under s 8(b)(i) of the MDA have been established by the statutory presumption.[^32] The burden thus shifted to the AP to disprove on a balance of probabilities that: (i) the Drug was present in his urine samples; and (ii) he had knowingly consumed the Drug in contravention of s 8(b)(i) of the MDA.

#### Issue (ii)

12     Whether or not the presumption has been rebutted, is a question of fact[^33]. As regards issue (ii), I agreed with the prosecution that the AP’s defence was entirely unsubstantiated as he has failed to adduce any evidence to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities for the reasons as submitted by the prosecution as follows:

> (a)     The AP levelled numerous wild allegations against the CNB officers to explain the presence of the Drug in his urine, but made no serious attempt to substantiate any of these allegations. He said that _“\[m\]aybe I’ve been spiked”[^34]_ and _“Even the CNB …can do my thing also spiked or not”[^35]_, but did not say how this could have happened; did not identify any persons who might be responsible for such spiking; did not call any witnesses in his defence; and did not question _any_ of the prosecution witnesses on spiking. This was mere speculation. As the AP had testified, “_If CNB capable of doing anything, I don’t know. Maybe spiked, I don’t know. That one, you ask them.”[^36]_

> (b)     The AP alluded repeatedly to an _“Indian girl”_ with a _“tattoo”_ or _“lips”_, and said that “_don’t know what signal she gave, my urine become different”_, but he did not call any such person as a witness, or ask the other prosecution witnesses about her.[^37]

> (c)     The AP had also testified: “_I will drink, I will sit down with my friend anywhere, maybe my tobacco or what, all smoking the same. Spiked, I don’t know…”[^38]_ Although they are not very clear, his remarks seem to mean that his tobacco might have been “spiked” somehow. However, the defence did not call the said friend to give evidence. Nor did the AP give any explanation for why any of his friends would “spike” his tobacco without his knowledge. The allegation was totally unsubstantiated and entirely speculative.

> (d)     The AP had not alluded to “spiking” or contamination in his cautioned statement under s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), which was recorded on 26 September 2019 (some two months after he was first arrested).[^39] The cautioned statement simply contained a bare denial of the offence as he had merely stated: _“…I am an alcoholic drinker, very heavy drinker, but I do not know why my urine contains \[controlled\] drugs. I do not know why my urine is tested positive when I did not take any drugs. That is all.”_

> (e)     Similarly, the AP’s long statements – which were not admitted in evidence, though they were disclosed as part of the criminal case disclosure conference (CCDC) process – also did not suggest any reason for why drugs had been found in his urine.[^40] The AP agreed that he had never mentioned spiking in his statements to the CNB.[^41] He also had not asserted in his Case for the Defence that the CNB officers had spiked his urine.[^42] This goes to show that his claims of spiking were all either fabrications or afterthoughts.

> (f)     The AP also did not offer any reason why the CNB officers (or indeed anyone else) would want to frame him for drug consumption. As the prosecution witnesses from CNB had testified, they had only gotten to know him through this case, and had no prior acquaintance with him.[^43] The AP likewise confirmed in cross-examination that he did not personally know the prosecution witnesses who had testified at the trial.[^44]

> (g)     The AP had testified that he had “followed” the urine procurement procedure in full[^45], which would mean that there was no opportunity for anybody to contaminate or “spike” his urine. The two small bottles containing his urine samples were either in his custody or in his line of sight at all times, up to the point when they were deposited into the locked metal boxes, which were only unlocked at the HSA.[^46]

> (h)     The AP ’s bare allegations of contamination and spiking fall far short of rebutting the statutory presumptions in ss 16 and 22 of the MDA. Such allegations can be made easily and are practically impossible to disprove, since that would entail the prosecution having to prove a negative. That is why the AP bore the burden of substantiating them as required under ss 16 and 22 of the MDA. His failure to call any witnesses or tender any evidence in support of his claims revealed them to be either sheer fabrications or afterthoughts or both. Indeed, the AP’s testimony at other points showed that he was not a credible witness. He made the frivolous and preposterous claim that _“\[a\]ll the CNB nowadays”_ were _“Hong Kong gangster”_ and _“Indian gangster”_[^47]. He further insisted that PW1 had not been among his arresting officers[^48], even though this was contradicted by PW1, a fellow arresting officer, PW2[^49], and the arrest report[^50]. His bare denial of guilt must likewise be viewed with grave scepticism and must be rejected.

#### No merit in defence submissions

13     I see no merit in the defence submissions for the following reasons:

> (a)     In view of the legislative presumptions under ss 16 and 22 of the MDA, the burden is on the AP to rebut these presumptions on a balance of probabilities with evidence to be adduced at the trial.

> (b)     The defence had failed to adduce any evidence at the trial to rebut the aforesaid legislative presumptions , except to continue asserting the AP’s bare claim that he did not consume any illegal drugs at the material time, did not know why his urine sample tested positive, and that as he has been going out with his friends, he believed that his drink or his cigarette may have been spiked by someone which has caused his urine to test positive. As held by the High Court in _Cheng Siah Johnson v PP <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 839</span> at \[17\] and \[25\]_ , a bare denial or declaration of innocence would be inadequate to rebut the presumption and it was incumbent on the defence to furnish evidence to show that his drink or his cigarette was spiked. As submitted by the prosecution, the cases confirmed that for a spiking defence to succeed, something more than mere assertions from the accused is needed. Two cases cited as examples by the prosecution are as follows:

>> (i)       In _PP v Tan Chui Yun Joselyn <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 85</span>_, the accused had gone for a pre-scheduled police interview on 3 May 2002, and her urine was found to contain a controlled drug on that day. Her defence was two-fold. First, it was extremely unlikely that she would knowingly consume drugs, knowing full well that she was scheduled for an interview with a police officer whom she knew to be from an antidrug squad: at \[5\]. Second, her drink could have been spiked when she was at a pub called Madam Wong’s the night before, as she had accepted a drink from a man in a white shirt. Her account was corroborated by another witness who had seen a man in a white shirt offer the accused a drink: at \[6\] The High Court affirmed the principle in _Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_, but held that the accused had met the threshold to rebut the presumptions. The Defence “did not merely assert a suspicion that \[the accused’s\] drink had been spiked” but bolstered this with evidence: at \[16\] and \[20\].

>> (ii)       In _PP v Tan Loon Lui <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 216</span>_, the accused called a witness (“Lim”) who admitted to spiking the accused’s drink prior to the accused’s arrest. Lim said he had put the drugs into five jugs of beer, which he then used to pour the accused a drink. There was no evidence that Lim was lying or had been paid by the accused to take the “fall”. The High Court upheld the trial judge’s findings and found that there was “concrete evidence that the accused’s drink was spiked”: at \[22\].

> (c)     I agreed with the prosecution that unlike the above 2 cases, the AP in the present case has not given any evidence whatsoever to rebut the presumptions. Though the AP claimed that he may have consumed something spiked by one of his friends, he has not called any such friends or even described any occasion on which the spiking might have occurred. Nor has he suggested any motive for his friends to spike anything he consumed. This places him in the same category as other accused persons whose spiking defences have been rejected for lack of evidence.[^51] In this regard, I totally rejected the defence submission that the AP has satisfied the "balance of probabilities" test when the AP claimed that he does not know why he tested positive for NPS by HSA, and the only explanation would be that his urine sample has been tampered with, or his tobacco may have been spiked when he was smoking with some friends, which is not a far-fetched explanation or something unbelievable (other than the AP having video evidence of the spiking).

> (d)     The fact that the NPS is taken by smoking like cigarette, by rolling into cigarette and smoking it and that nobody knows what it smells or taste like did not and cannot support the AP’s defence that his drink or his cigarette may have been spiked, in the absence of any evidence adduced by the defence at the trial on how and why the AP’s drink or his cigarette may have been spiked, and by whom. In this regard, I accepted the prosecution submission that PW7 never said that the Drug has no taste as what PW7 had actually testified was there was little literature on the Drug “because it’s a novel substance”, so she was “not too sure what the smoke tastes like”. In other words, “no one has ever mentioned” whether the Drug has any taste, so she “wouldn’t be able to comment” one way or another[^52]. That is not the same as the defence asserting that the Drug has no taste. While it was open to the defence to call expert witnesses of their own to testify on the taste or smell of the Drug, the defence did not do so at the trial.

> (e)     The fact that the AP’s urine test result in the IUT machine at the CNB office was negative did not advance the defence in any way as PW3, PW5, PW6 and PW7 had explained at the trial that the IUT conducted at the CNB office was unable to detect the presence of NPS because it did not have the correct reagent for detection which explained why the IUT result was negative despite the presence of NPS in the AP’s urine.[^53] The IUT “Urine Test Result Slip” (in P2) was not used against the AP to establish the prosecution case which relied on the HSA certificates (in P4 and 5) pursuant to s 16 of the MDA.

> (f)     The fact that the NPS has a street name "mushroom", "mush" or "K2" and can be bought from the streets and easily be used to spike the cigarette of people who are unaware and have no way of detecting it, thereby making it dangerous to charge a person for consumption of NPS just because his urine tested positive without more corroborative evidence did not and cannot advance the AP’s defence. Contrary to the defence submissions, the MDA does not require the CNB to get more corroborative evidence to show the AP’s guilt. In this regard, I agreed with the prosecution submission that :

>> (i)       based on the legislative presumptions under ss 16 and 22 of the MDA, both the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_ elements of the offence under s 8(b)(i) of the MDA have been established by the statutory presumptions[^54] and the burden shifted to the AP to adduce evidence at the trial to disprove on a balance of probabilities that: (i) the Drug was present in his urine samples; and (ii) he had knowingly consumed the Drug in contravention of s 8(b)(i) of the MDA. The AP had failed to do so at the trial. As submitted by the prosecution, it would be dangerous to acquit anyone who relies on a spiking defence without substantiating that claim with evidence, because such defences are “extremely easy to make but … almost impossible to debunk” and that is why “a judge may be obliged to approach such a defence with greater caution and circumspection than usual in the absence of any other credible evidence”.[^55] In this regard, I rejected the defence submission that reliance by the prosecution solely on the evidence of the positive urine test result is dangerous to convict the AP and that the prosecution has not proven that the AP “knowingly” consumed the NPS in view of the legislative presumptions under ss 16 and 22 of the MDA.

>> (ii)       the defence assertion that “CNB is taking short-cut in their investigation instead of getting more corroborative evidence to show the guilt of the AP” is not only irrelevant to the question of the AP’s guilt or innocence, it is also untrue and unfair. Any investigative agency can only be expected to pursue evidential leads which are credible and relevant. The AP had not raised his spiking defence in his cautioned and long statements, nor did his Case for the Defence provide any verifiable particulars of any persons who might have been responsible for the spiking. Given that such matters would be within the AP’s own knowledge, the responsibility lay with him and him alone to adduce some evidence in support of his claims.

## CONCLUSION FOR THE TRIAL AND SENTENCE

14     For all the above reasons, I totally rejected the defence submissions and found that the AP had failed to rebut the legislative presumptions under ss 16 and 22 of the MDA and he is therefore not authorized under the MDA or Regulations to consume the Drug. I found that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the charge in DAC 927299/ 2019 which has been preferred against the AP under s 8(b)(i) of the MDA.

15     Accordingly, I found the AP guilty and convicted him of the aforesaid charge and I sentenced him to the prescribed minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment as submitted by both parties.
