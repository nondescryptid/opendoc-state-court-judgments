19 October 2020

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

1       The Accused, Mr Karuppiah Kaneshan, pleaded guilty to a charge for cheating, under section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). I sentenced the Accused to _12 months’ imprisonment_.

2       The Accused being dissatisfied with the _sentence_ has filed an appeal. He is currently on _bail pending appeal_.

## The Charge

3       The details of the charge which the Accused pleaded guilty to were as follows:

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on 2 July 2018, in Singapore, did cheat one Mohan Lawrence S/O Kesavan, _to wit_, by deceiving the said Mohan Lawrence S/O Kesavan into believing that you would invest the moneys he delivered to you in 7-Eleven and/or Singapore Pools outlets and that he would receive returns on the said investment, which facts you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Mohan Lawrence S/O Kesavan to deliver property to you, _to wit_, by transferring S$6,000 to your POSB Savings Account (Bank Account No. XXX), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Facts

4       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification:

> 1.    The accused is Karuppiah Kaneshan, NRIC No. SXXX, a 60-year-old male Singapore citizen born on 24 September 1959.

> 2.    The complainant and victim is Mohan Lawrence S/O Kesavan, a 58-year-old male.

> **FIRST INFORMATION REPORT (F/20180801/2052) PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE**

> 3.    On 1 August 2018, at or about 12.05pm, the victim lodged a Police report at Ang Mo Kio North Neighbourhood Police Centre stating that he had been cheated by the accused.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE (DAC-909415-2019)**

> 4.    The victim knew the accused’s father from the 1980s. The accused first approached the victim sometime in 2004 and asked the victim to invest in a coffeeshop business. The victim declined as he did not have sufficient capital to do so. Since then, the accused approached the victim on multiple occasions, offering the victim the opportunity to invest in various businesses. The victim declined on each of these occasions.

> 5.    On 2 July 2018, the victim finally agreed to meet the accused at Junction Nine, 18 Yishun Avenue 9, Singapore, and listen to the accused’s investment offer as the victim had some capital to spare. At the meeting, the accused invited the victim to invest in Singapore Pools and/or 7-Eleven outlets through the accused.

> 6.    The accused told the victim that he would receive good returns on his investment on a monthly basis, namely S$8,000 a month for an investment in a Singapore Pools outlet and approximately S$5,000 a month for an investment in a 7-Eleven outlet. These were facts which the accused knew to be false. The accused had no intention in investing the victim’s money in the said outlets. Instead, the accused intended to use the victim’s money for his personal expenses and to fund his gambling habit.

> 7.    As part of the deception, the accused brought his chequebook along to the meeting and told the victim to help him write a cheque for S$72,000 in favour of one “Tan”. The accused then signed the said cheque and told the victim that he would be investing S$72,000 in the said outlets once the victim transferred him the sum he was willing to invest.

> 8.    By such manner of deception, the victim was dishonestly induced into agreeing to invest S$6,000 in the said outlets through the accused and transferring the said S$6,000 from his POSB Savings Account (Bank Account No. XXX) into the accused’s POSB Savings Account (Bank Account No. XXX) later the same day.

> 9.    Subsequently on the same day, at or about 8pm, the accused requested for a further S$7,000 from the victim. The victim declined as he could not afford it. The accused then reduced the sum requested to S$5,000. The victim declined again.

> 10.    On or about 17 July 2018, the accused requested a further S$3,000 from the victim on the basis that they were GST charges for the total amount invested. The victim declined and became suspicious.

> 11.    On or about 18 July 2018, the victim informed the accused that he wanted to withdraw his investment of S$6,000. However, the victim did not receive an answer from the accused as to whether or not he could do so.

> 12.    On or about 19 July 2018, the victim again informed the accused that he wanted to withdraw his investment of S$6,000. However, the accused was evasive in relation to whether or not the victim could do so.

> 13.    On or about 23 July 2018, the accused told the victim that he would issue a cheque in favour of the victim on 27 July 2018, and that the victim would receive the sum he transferred to the accused by 31 July 2018.

> 14.    On 31 July 2018, the victim checked his POSB Savings Account and realised that the accused had not transferred him the sum of S$6,000. The victim therefore decided to lodge a Police report the next day.

> 15.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused did cheat the victim and thereby dishonestly induced the victim to transfer S$6,000 to the accused’s POSB Savings Account, and the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 16.    On 31 October 2018, the accused transferred S$1,500 into the victim’s POSB Savings Account. To-date, the accused has not made restitution of the remaining S$4,500.

> 17.    The accused admits to the abovementioned offence and stands charged accordingly.

## Sentence

### Prescribed punishment

6       Section 420 of the Penal Code stated[^1]:

> Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

7       The prosecution tendered skeletal sentencing submissions, supplemented by oral submissions in Court, and sought a sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment against the Accused.

8       The prosecution submitted that the primary sentencing considerations in this case were general and specific deterrence. The prosecution emphasised that the Accused’s antecedents for related offences underscored the need for specific deterrence in this instance.

9       The prosecution proceeded to highlight the aggravating factors present in this case. Firstly, the offence was premeditated. The Accused had approached the victim on multiple occasions with investment opportunities since 2004. He had also brought along a cheque book when he met with the victim, and issued a cheque for $72,000 to add to the deception. Secondly, there was a lack of remorse on the Accused’s part as evinced by him requesting the victim to transfer further sums of money on two subsequent occasions. The third aggravating factor was that the Accused was traced for cheating offences involving similar modus operandi – by proffering investment opportunities in non-existent investment schemes. In this connection, the prosecution pointed out that the Accused was sentenced to a total of 18 months’ imprisonment and 24 months’ imprisonment respectively for his 1987 and 2016 convictions for cheating.

10     Nonetheless, the prosecution noted that there were mitigating factors in favour of the Accused. First, the Accused had made partial restitution of $1500 to the victim, and second, he had pleaded guilty. The prosecution informed the Court that it had taken these mitigating factors into consideration in arriving at the sentencing position of at least 12 months’ imprisonment, by proposing a two-month uplift from the Accused’s previous sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment on one of the charges he pleaded guilty to in 2016. It was further submitted that the uplift was justified, as the modus operandi for that particular offence, as well as the amount cheated, were similar to those in the current case.[^2]

### Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

11     In mitigation, Counsel stated that the Accused would like to extend his sincere apologies to the victim. Counsel also highlighted that the sum involved was only $6000 of which $1500 had been returned. Unfortunately, the Accused was unable to make any further restitution in respect of the balance amount because he was jobless.

12     Counsel added that the Accused’s wife had passed away suddenly a year ago and it had taken a big toll on him. His son had since decided to sell the house where the Accused was residing, and the Accused was doing odd jobs to make ends meet. Counsel emphasised that the defence acknowledged the Accused’s antecedents but would ask the Court for a discount in view of his guilty plea and partial restitution. Thus, instead of an uplift of two months as proposed by the prosecution, Counsel urged the Court to consider imposing a sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment instead, as the amount involved was relatively low.

### Sentencing considerations

13     In calibrating sentence, I first considered the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Based on the facts admitted by the Accused, I agreed with the prosecution that the element of premeditation was present. The Accused had repeatedly approached the victim with opportunities for investment since 2004. As highlighted by the prosecution, when the victim finally agreed to meet with the Accused to discuss the latest investment offer, the Accused brought along a cheque book and put up a charade of investing $72,000 in the same business himself, to make the deception more convincing. In addition, after receiving $6000 from the victim, the Accused persistent with subsequent attempts to obtain further payments from the victim in relation to the same fictitious investment. In my view, this demonstrated the Accused’s greed and lack of remorse. It was fortunate that these attempts failed because the victim could not afford further payments.

14     In the Accused’s favour, I noted that he had made partial restitution to the victim soon after the latter reported the matter to the police, and before he was charged in Court for the offence. The Accused had also pleaded guilty as a sign of his remorse, albeit on the first day of trial.

15     Next, I turned to consider the Accused’s antecedents. In this regard, I was mindful that the Accused’s antecedent in 1987 was dated. As for the Accused’s conviction in 2016, I noted that he was sentenced to a global term of 24 months’ imprisonment after pleading guilty to 3 cheating charges. Further, according to the case disposition details submitted by the prosecution, the sentence took effect from 12 February 2016. Thus, the Accused had committed the present offence about a year after his release from prison.

16     In addition, having studied the statement of facts for the 2016 conviction, I agreed with the prosecution that the facts and circumstances relating to the charge in DAC 921154-2015, for which the Accused was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment, were largely similar to those in the present case, though the amount involved in the previous case ($15,000) was relatively higher. In committing that offence, the Accused had similarly persisted in asking the victim to invest in a business which the Accused knew was non-existent. To convince the victim, the Accused similarly told the victim that he would also invest $90,000 in the same venture, and that the victim would receive good returns every month. In both instances, the Accused had cheated the victims as he faced financial difficulties and wanted to use the money to fund his gambling habit.

17     In view of the above, I agreed with the prosecution that there was indeed a need for specific deterrence in this case. Further, I was of the view that the 11 months’ imprisonment term proposed by the defence, which represented a one-month uplift from the previous term of 10 months’ imprisonment, would not be sufficient for the purpose of deterrence, as the Accused had re-offended soon after.

### Sentence imposed

18     Hence, having carefully weighed all the facts and circumstances of this case, I sentenced the Accused to 12 months’ imprisonment. In my view, this would be proportionate to the Accused’s culpability and sufficient for the purpose of deterrence.

19     For completeness, I should add that I had initially granted the Accused’s application to defer the commencement of his sentence to 30 October 2020. As the Accused subsequently filed an appeal against sentence, I granted a stay on the execution of his sentence of imprisonment, and placed him on bail pending appeal.
