### District Judge Salina Ishak:

## Introduction

#### Background

1       The accused, Mr Tan Yan Chong, a 36 year-old Singapore citizen had faced 23 charges involving a range of offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008), the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) and the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, Rev Ed 2015). He was first charged in Court 26 on 7 April 2018. His matters were finally dealt with on 21 November 2019 when he pleaded guilty to seven charges namely:

> (a)     Three charges under s 8(a) punishable under s 33(1) Misuse of Drugs Act in **DAC 913294-2018**, **DAC 901121-2019** and **DAC 901127-2019**;

> (e)     One charge under s 6(3) Protection from Harassment Act in **MAC 912589-2018**.

2       He consented to the remaining 16 charges to be taken into considerations for sentencing. His global imprisonment term was 23 months’ imprisonment with effect from 2 August 2019. He is presently serving his sentence and his earliest date of release is 11 November 2020.

3       On 27 July 2020, some eight months’ after being sentenced for reasons best known to him, the accused filed a Criminal Motion No. 35 of 2020 seeking an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal. On 30 September 2020, upon the accused and the Prosecution consenting to the relief sought, leave was granted for the accused to file the Notice of Appeal for the present case within 14 days’ of 30 September 2020. A Notice of Appeal against his sentence was subsequently filed on 2 October 2020.

4       I now set out the seven proceeded charges against him.

8       Pursuant to s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012), I ordered the sentences for three charges, namely DAC-913294-2018, MAC-904243-2018 and DAC-915888-2018 to run consecutively. The sentences for the remaining four charges in DAC-901121-2019, DAC-901127-2019, DAC-913919-2018 and MAC-912589-2018 were ordered to run concurrently. His global sentence was 23 months’ imprisonment with effect from 2 August 2019, the date he was first produced in court after the warrant of arrest issued against him on 6 June 2019 for his absence in court was executed for the present charges.

9       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Summary of Facts

10     The accused is a 35-year-old male (D.O.B: 12/07/1984). His address is at Blk 188C, #XXX, Rivervale Drive, Singapore (“the Rivervale unit”). He was unemployed at the time of his arrest. At the time of his arrest he was residing at 10 Shelford Road #04-01, Singapore (“the Shelford unit”).

A. BACKGROUND FACTS PERTAING TO THE DRUG CHARGES

11     The accused was first arrested on 5 April 2018 at about 9.50am by police officers at the Shelford unit in relation to the house-breaking offence. He was brought to police lock-up initially but after informing the officers about possible drug exhibits, the accused, on the same day, at about 3.40pm, was escorted back to the Shelford unit by officers from the Central Narcotic Bureau (“CNB”). A search was conducted at the Shelford unit and the 67 drug-related exhibits as listed in paragraph 4 of the Statement of Facts were seized.

12     On 5 April 2018 at about 5.40pm, the accused was escorted to Blk 188C Rivervale Drive #XXX, Singapore (“the Rivervale Drive unit”) which is the official address of the accused. A search was conducted and four drug-related exhibits as listed in paragraph 5 of the Statement of Fact were seized. The accused was then brought to CNB office at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarter for further investigations.

#### i. Facts pertaining to the 1st charge: DAC-913294-2018

13     41 of the exhibits consisting of crystalline substances and the fragmented vegetable matter as listed at paragraph 7 of the Statement of Facts recovered from the Shelford unit were sealed in tamper-proof bags and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) on 10 April 2018 for analysis. The above exhibits were found to be thirty-one packets containing not less than 10.7 grams of crystalline substance, one packet containing not less than 0.41 gram of fragmented vegetable matter, seven containers containing not less than 1.79 grams of crystalline substance, one bottle containing not less than 0.3 gram of crystalline substance and one exhibit containing not less than 0.27 gram of crystalline substance. These exhibits were analysed and found to contain not less than 6.75 grams of methamphetamine.

14     Methamphetamine is a ‘Class A’ Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act. The accused is not authorised under the Misuse of Drugs Act or the Regulations made thereunder to have in his possession methamphetamine.

15     The accused admitted to ownership of the aforementioned seized drug exhibits upon questioning and knew that some of the exhibits contained methamphetamine (known to him as ‘ice’). They were intended for his own consumption or he would sell them if people wanted to purchase them from him. The accused had last purchased methamphetamine from one ‘Apple’. He had purchased methamphetamine from the latter a total of about 5 times.

16     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s 8(a), punishable under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

#### ii. Facts pertaining to the 2nd charge: DAC-913919-2018

17     Following his arrest on 5 April 2018, the accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed and marked in his presence. The urine samples were sent to the HSA on 6 April 2018 for analysis.

18     On 9 April 2018, the HSA subsequently issued two certificates under s 16 of the MDA. Analyst Chan Si Jia from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to one of the accused’s urine sample issued the certificate bearing lab no.: AT-1833-03325-001-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine. Analyst Ong Han Hui Jordan from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the accused’s other urine sample issued the certificate bearing lab no.: AT-1833-03325-002-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

19     Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The accused was not authorised under the Misuse of Drugs Act or the Regulations made thereunder to consume a methamphetamine. The accused admitted that three days prior to his arrest he had consumed methamphetamine by placing the methamphetamine in an improvised ‘bong’, heating the bottom of the ‘bong’and inhaling the smoke produced. By virtue of the foregoing the accused had committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

#### iii. Facts pertaining to the 16th charge: DAC-901121-2019

20     12 of the exhibits that consisted of various types of tablets as listed at paragraph 20 of the Statement of facts that were seized from the Shelford unit were sealed in tamper-proof bags and sent to the HSA on 10 April 2018 for analysis. The exhibits were found to be 37 tablets, 2 fragments of tablets, 3 containers containing granular/powdery substance and 1 packet containing granular/powdery. In total, they were found to contain not less than 4.55 grams of MDMA.

21     MDMA is a ‘Class A’ Controlled Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The accused is not authorised under the Misuse of Drugs Act or the Regulations made thereunder to possess MDMA. The accused admitted upon questioning that the aforementioned drug exhibits were in his possession and that he knew that they contained MDMA (known to him as ecstasy). The drugs were either intended for his own consumption or he would sell or gift them to others. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under the s 8(a) punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

#### iv. Facts pertaining to the 22nd charge: DAC-901127-2019

22     The two tablets that were seized from the Rivervale Drive unit marked as “TYC-P4” were sealed in a tamper-proof bag and sent to the HSA on 9 April 2018 for analysis. On 17 May 2018, Analyst Tang Shi Ying Angeline from the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the exhibit marked “TYC-P4”, issued a certificate bearing Lab. No. ID-1832-00737-069 under s 16 of the MDA, stating that the exhibit was found to be one brown tablet and brown granular/powdery substance weighing not less than 0.48 grams, which was analysed and found to contain ethylone and ketamine.

23     Ketamine is a ‘Class A’ Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to have in his possession ketamine. Upon questioning, the accused admitted to the possession of ketamine and was aware of its nature. The drugs were either intended for his own consumption or he would sell or gift them to others. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s 8(a) punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

B. BACKGROUND FACTS TO THE HOUSE BREAKING BY NIGHT AND MISCHIEF BY FIRE CHARGES

24     Wong Soon Yuh was the victim in relation to these two offences (“the victim”). The victim is the accused’s neighbour. The victim lives at 10 Shelford Road #XXX, Singapore. For no valid reason, the accused committed the following offences against the victim.

i. _Facts pertaining to the 4th charge: MAC-90443-2018_

25     On 5 April 2018 at about 6.23am, the victim called ‘999’ and reported that the accused had climbed onto his balcony and banged on his door. The accused had climbed onto the victim’s balcony from his own balcony at about 6.00am by climbing over the low wall that separates the accused’s unit from the victim’s unit.

26     The victim and his girlfriend were awoken by the noise created by the accused. After climbing onto the victim’s balcony, the accused was seen by the victim trying to pry open the glass doors of the victim’s home. The victim then opened the glass doors and questioned the accused as to what he was doing. The accused then claimed that the victim’s girlfriend had installed CCTVs in his home and was monitoring him. In fact, earlier on at about 3.00am, the accused had called ‘999’ to report that the victim’s girlfriend had installed CCTVs in his house and they had admitted to it. However at about 3.13am, the accused called ‘999’ again and told the police not to come to his house as he would like to talk it out with the victim first.

27     The accused’s actions were evidently done with the intent to annoy the victim. After this interaction, the accused climbed back into his unit by climbing over the low wall separating both units. The accused admitted upon questioning to having climbed over the low wall onto the victim’s balcony to confront the victim about the alleged CCTVs. By virtue of the foregoing the accused has committed an offence under s 446 punishable under s 456 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008).

#### ii. Facts pertaining to the 5th charge: DAC-91888-2018

28     On 28 April 2018 at about 5.59pm, one Yong Wei Wei, residing on the same floor as the victim and the accused, called ‘999’ and reported that the accused was trying to light the victim’s front door on fire. Yong Wei Wei had heard sounds coming from the corridor at about 3.00pm. When she looked through the peephole in her door she saw the accused squatting in front of the victim’s front door and using duct tape to seal the edges of the victim’s front door. She decided not to act on what she saw. However at about 6.00pm she saw the accused light a roll of paper on fire and brush it against the main door of the victim’s unit. She also saw the accused spray what she believed to be aerosol on the victim’s front door.

29     When the police officers attended to the scene, the accused was placed under arrest. The accused clearly intended to cause damage to the victim’s home through the use of fire. Further he did in fact cause damage to the victim’s front door as there were burn marks on the door. He has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 435 of the Penal Code. Some police officers stayed behind to await the victim’s return. When the victim returned home and opened the front door, the police discovered soil mixed with glass shards. They had evidently been shoved under the door.

C. BACKGROUND FACTS TO THE POHA CHARGE

30     The complainant is Sergeant Renganathan Gopalakrishnan (“the complainant”) and he works as a Singapore Prison Service Officer at Changi Prison Complex Cluster B located at 984 Upper Changi Road North, Singapore.

#### i. Facts pertaining to the 7th charge: MAC-912589-2018

31     On 19 April 2018, at about 1.45pm the complainant was escorting the accused for bail at Changi Prison and was thereby executing his duty as a public servant. They were around the Main Entrance of Cluster B of the Prison Complex when the incident occurred. The accused complained that the clothes provided by the Singapore Prison Service for bail inmates were transparent. When the complainant explained to the accused that the clothes were standard issue, the accused shouted “fuck you” at the complainant.

32     The complainant told the accused to be careful about the words he used. The accused then repeated “fuck you” to the complainant but softer. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, Rev Ed 2015).

## Antecedents

33     The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

#### Global sentence

34     In their written submissions on sentence, the Prosecution had sought a global sentence of 23 months’ imprisonment.

#### Individual sentences

35     In respect of DAC-913294-2018, the charge for possession of 6.75g of methamphetamine, it was submitted that a sentence of at least ten months’ imprisonment should be imposed. It was submitted that given the quantity of drugs (including the TIC charges), there was a considerable latent risk that the drugs would end up in the hands of others. This was especially in light of the fact that the accused stated that he would either sell or gift the drugs away if asked.

36     For the other drug possession charges, the Prosecution had sought the following sentences, namely for DAC-901121-2019 - the charge for possession of 4.55g of MDMA, a sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment and for DAC-901127-2019 - the charge for possession of 0.48g of ketamine, a sentence of at least six months’ imprisonment.

37     For DAC-913919-2018 - the charge for consumption of methamphetamine, it was submitted that a sentence of at least ten months’ imprisonment should be imposed. It was the Prosecution’s case that the range was from six to 18 months’ imprisonment for a first time offender ( See: _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span>_)_. It was submitted that the mandatory minimum sentence of one year was not applicable in this case because the offence was committed before 1 April 2019. It was further submitted that the sentence imposed should be in the mid-range because the accused appears to be an addict given the amount of drugs that were found in his house and his admission that they were mainly meant for his own consumption.

38     For MAC-904243-2018, the charge of house-breaking by night, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least nine months’ imprisonment. For the mischief by fire charge in DAC-915888-2018, it was submitted that a sentence of at least four months’ imprisonment should be imposed. For the remaining charge of threatening, abusing or insulting public servant or public service worker in MAC-912589-2018, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least one week’s imprisonment.

## Mitigation

39     In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused has sought for the lightest sentence possible given the fact that this was his first offence. He had highlighted that his medical status as having HIV was disclosed by a judge in open court. He further highlighted that his mother and half-sister had no prior knowledge of his HIV and Hepatitis B as it had been kept as a secret away from them.

40     The accused submitted that with regards to the various charges, he had been highly co-operative with the authorities, especially the CNB officers. For the ‘E’ division police officers, he highlighted that he had complained about them manhandling him when he was just sleeping on his sofa for the criminal trespass case that had been upgraded to house-breaking by night.

41     He further submitted that he had no legal representation and thus his mitigating factors may not be what the court was accustomed to. He highlighted that he had put in some effort to find out the sentencing tariffs in the State Court library. That was his sincere effort to understand the constraints and considerations such as the harm to the public. In his case, it was submitted that the harm to the public was only to himself. He had admitted to the CNB in his statement showing his sincerity and co-operation.

42     According to the accused, he had sought self-admission to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for his drug issues before being caught. This was a good mitigating factor. He submitted that the harm caused to the public was limited to a certain extent because there were no complementary crime that arose out of his crimes such as rape or having more syndicates as a result of his act. He also asked for his sentence to be backdated to the date of his arrest.

## Prosecution’s Reply

43     In response to the accused’s plea in mitigation, it was the Prosecution’s case that the fact that he was a first offender should not be given too much weight in view of the series of offences he had committed.

44     On the issue of whether there was any harm caused by his offences to the public at large, it was submitted that the accused had admitted in his Statement of Facts that he would either sell or give away the drugs if asked. It was fortunate that he did not have a trafficking charge against him.

45     The Prosecution highlighted that the accused was first charged in court on 7 April 2018 and was bailed out within less than a month. There had been a substantial break since then until the point of time when he was remanded again. It was submitted that it was not fit that the sentences be backdated to the date of his first remand.

## Sentence

#### Prescribed Penalties

46     The prescribed punishment for a first offence of drug possession under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act is a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or a fine of up to $20,000 or to both. As the drug consumption charge was committed on 5 April 2018 prior to the enhancement to the punishment which took effect on 1 April 2019, the prescribed punishment for a first offence of drug consumption under s 8(b) of the Act is similarly a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or a fine of up to $20,000 or to both. The prescribed punishment for a first offence of drug possession has since been enhanced to an imprisonment term of not less than one year and not more than 10 years and the offender shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $20,000.

47     The prescribed punishment for an offence of mischief by fire under s 435 of the Penal Code is an imprisonment term which may extend to seven years and the offender shall also be liable to fine.

48     The prescribed punishment for an offence of house-breaking by night under s 456 of the Penal Code committed prior to 1 January 2020 is a term of imprisonment which may extend to three years, and the offender shall also be liable to fine. This provision has since been repealed as part of the simplication of the Penal Code and to remove the unnecessary distinction between the offences of “lurking house-trespass” and “housebreaking”.

49     The prescribed punishment for an offence of using abusive words towards a public officer in relation to the execution of his duty as a public servant under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

50     In the present case, I was mindful that although he was a first offender, the accused had committed a series of serious offences _ie_ a total of 23 charges on four separate occasions, namely:

> (a)     5 April 2018 - 19 drug-related charges under ss 8(a), 8(b)(ii) and s 9 Misuse of Drugs Act as well as one charge of house-breaking by night under s 456 Penal Code;

> (b)     19 April 2018 - a charge of uttering abusive words towards a public servant in relation to the execution of his duties as he was being escorted for bail under s 6(3) Protection from Harassment Act;

> (c)     27 April 2018 - a charge of committing mischief under s 426 Penal Code while he was out on court bail; and

> (d)     28 April 2018 – a charge of committing mischief by fire intending to cause damage to any property under s 435 Penal Code while he was out on court bail.

51     In addition, I noted that the accused had also been remanded for three different periods namely:

> (a)     from 7 April 2018 to 19 April 2018 when he was first charged in court until the date he was first bailed out,

> (b)     7 May 2018 to 21 May 2018 when he was remanded in IMH for psychiatric examination and

> (c)     2 August 2019 until 21 November 2019 after he was arrested for being absent from court on 6 June 2019.

52     I next considered the appropriate individual sentences to be imposed for the seven proceeded charges.

## Individual Sentences

#### Drug Possession

53     In essence, the three proceeded unauthorised drug possession offences in DAC 913294-2018, DAC 901121-2019 and DAC 901127-2019 involved three different types of Class A controlled drugs, namely methamphetamine, ketamine and MDMA. In the present case, it was undisputed that the accused appeared to be an addict given the amount of drugs that were found in his house and his admission that they were mainly meant for his own consumption.

54     Nevertheless, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that given the quantity of drugs (including the 14 drug possession charges that were taken into consideration), there was a considerable latent risk that the drugs would end up in the hands of others especially as the accused himself had stated that he would either sell or gift the drugs away if asked. In my view, his level of culpability as well as the harm caused could not be considered as being in the low range but was more consistent with the twin factors of harm and culpability being in the medium range. Hence, I disagreed with the accused’s submission that the level of harm caused was limited as the harm caused was only to himself and that there were no complementary crime that arose out of his crimes.

55     The usual range of sentences for a first offence of unauthorised drug possession is between eight to 12 months’ imprisonment depending on the type and amounts of drugs involved. In addition, the other factors that would affect the sentence would be the variety of drugs involved (if any), the number of proceeded charges, the charges that were taken into consideration as well as any other mitigating or aggravating factors.

#### DAC 913294-2018

56     The first charge involved the unauthorised possession of thirty-one packets containing not less than 10.7 grams of crystalline substance, one packet containing not less than 0.41 grams of fragmented vegetable matter, seven containers containing not less than 1.79 grams of crystalline substance, one bottle containing not less than 0.3 grams of crystalline substance and one tube containing not less than 0.27 grams of crystalline substance which were analysed and found to contain not less than 6.75 grams of methamphetamine. It was clear that this was by no means an insignificant amount. It was also an aggravating factor that the drugs were not only meant for his own consumption but the accused would sell the said drugs if people wanted to purchase them from him. Under these circumstances, the starting point for such an offence would be at least 12 months’ imprisonment.

#### DAC 901121-2019

57     The 16th charge involved the unauthorised possession of 37 tablets, 2 fragments of tablets, 3 containers containing granular/powdery substance and one packet containing granular/powdery substance which were found to contain not less than 4.55 grams of MDMA. Once again, this was by no means an insignificant amount. It was also an aggravating factor that apart from intending to use the drugs for his own consumption, he would also sell or gift the said drugs to others. Based on such circumstances, the starting point for such an offence would be at least ten months’ imprisonment.

#### DAC 901127-2019

58     The 22nd charge involved the unauthorised possession of one brown tablet and brown granular/powdery substance weighing not less than 0.48 grams that was found to contain ketamine. The drugs were either intended for his own consumption or that he would gift them to others. In view of the small amount of drugs involved, the starting point would be at least eight months’ imprisonment which was lowest tariff for such an offence.

59     Nevertheless, as the accused was first offender who had pleaded guilty to the proceeded charges, he had co-operated with the CNB officers and had earlier been remanded for about 28 days as set out at \[51(a) and (b)\] above, this warranted a downward calibration of the individual sentences from the starting points as set out earlier. The Prosecution had sought an imprisonment term of ten months’ imprisonment for the charge in DAC 913294-2018, eight months’ imprisonment for DAC 901121-2019 and six months’ imprisonment for DAC 901127-2019_._ In my view, the proposed sentences were just and appropriate in the circumstances of the present case. Accordingly, I imposed the following sentences:

> (a)     DAC 913294-2018 – 10 months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     DAC 901121-2019 – 8 months’ imprisonment; and

> (c)     DAC 901127-2019 – 6 months’ imprisonment.

#### Drug Consumption

#### DAC 913919-2018

60     The second charge was for unauthorised drug consumption. The sentencing range for a first offender prior to the enhancement to the prescribed punishment is between six to 18 months’ imprisonment. The lower end of the tariff is meant for a casual or one-off abuser of drugs. In the present case, the accused had consumed a Class A controlled drug _ie_ methamphetamine and it was undisputed that he was an addict who had purchased the said drugs from one ‘Apple’. He had purchased the drugs from the latter on five occasions previously. It was an aggravating factor that he would also sell the said drug if people wanted to purchase them from him. Based on such circumstances, the starting point for such an offence would be at least 10 months’ imprisonment.

61     Nevertheless, as the accused was first offender who had pleaded guilty, he had co-operated with the CNB officers and had earlier been remanded for about 28 days as set out at \[51(a) and (b)\] above, this warranted a downward calibration of the sentence to eight months’ imprisonment as proposed by the Prosecution. As such in respect of DAC 913919-2018, I imposed a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment.

#### House-breaking by night

#### MAC 904243-2018

62     The fourth charge was a house-breaking by night offence that resulted in his first arrest by the police on 5 April 2018 and the subsequent discovery of the multiple drug-related offences due to his co-operation with the authorities.

63     I noted that on 5 April 2018 at about 6.00am, the accused had climbed over a low wall separating his unit from the neighbouring unit onto the victim’s balcony from his own balcony. He had done so to confront the victim’s girlfriend whom he believed had installed CCTVs in his home and was monitoring him. After doing so, he tried to pry open the glass doors of the victim’s home but was confronted by the victim. At 6.23am, the victim called the police and reported that the accused had climbed onto his balcony and banged on his door.

64     In determining the appropriate sentence, the factors to be considered include the type of the property broken into, the purpose of committing the offence _ie_ whether to annoy or to commit an offence, whether there was any actual or threatened harm, damage or fear caused to the occupants, the length of time involved and whether the offender was armed. An invasion of a private home is generally considered more serious compared to a commercial property. The usual tariff for such an offence is between nine to 12 months’ imprisonment.

65     In the present case, the accused had climbed over to the victim’s unit with the intention to annoy the victim and had even tried to pry the doors open. I was also mindful that based on the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) report dated 20 May 2018, at the material time the accused had psychotic symptoms which were persecutory in nature which had contributed to the commission of the offence. The fact that he was abusing methamphetamines could have also contributed to his psychotic symptoms. He was further assessed to be aware of the nature and quality of his actions. Based on these circumstances, the starting point for the offence ought to be in the mid-range of the sentencing tariff.

66     Nevertheless, as the accused was first offender who had pleaded guilty, he had co-operated with the CNB officers, he had earlier been remanded for about 28 days and the offence had taken place over a short period of time, this warranted a downward calibration of the sentence and I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions of at least nine months’ imprisonment. As such in respect of MAC 90443-2018, I imposed a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment.

#### Mischief by fire

#### DAC 915888-2018

67     The fifth charge was a mischief by fire charge which was committed on 28 April 2018 against the same victim in the fourth charge while the accused was on court bail. The accused had used duct tape to seal the edges of the victim’s front door. Subsequently, he used a lighted roll of paper and brushed it against the main door of the victim’s unit. The accused was also seen spraying what was believed to be aerosol on the victim’s door. He had intended to cause damage to the door as there were burn marks on the door.

68     In determining the appropriate sentence for the present charge, the relevant factors would include the extent of damage caused, whether there were endangerment to lives, the purpose of committing the offence _ie_ a revenge attack or in connection with an illegal activity such as unlicensed moneylending, secret society and whether there were any effort by the offender to put out the fire. Due to its serious nature, the present charge is punishable with a mandatory term of imprisonment.

69     In the present case, I was mindful of the fact that this was the third occasion the accused had targeted his neighbouring unit. Apart from the initial incident on 5 April 2018, on 27 April 2018 at about 2am at the corridor in front of the unit, the accused had committed mischief under s 426 Penal Code by pouring glue and causing damage to the door of the victim’s unit (TIC charge in MAC-912556-2018). There was clearly an escalation of his criminal acts against the same victim. He had also denied committing the present charge in his IMH report. It was only fortuitous that his actions on 28 April 2018 was witnessed by a resident from the same floor who had called the police and reported that the accused was trying to light the victim’s door on fire. It was also fortuitous that there were only burn marks on the door and the victim was not at home at the time of the offence. Based on these circumstances, the starting point for the offence ought to be six months’ imprisonment.

70     Nevertheless, in light of his plea of guilt, the minor damage caused and his prior earlier remand of 28 days, this warranted a downward calibrations of the sentence and I agreed with the proposed sentence of at least four months’ imprisonment. Accordingly in respect of DAC 915888-2018, I imposed a sentence of four months’ imprisonment.

#### Use of abusive words against a public servant

#### MAC 912589-2018

71     Finally, in respect of the seventh charge the accused had committed the offence of using abusive words on a public servant on 19 April 2018 at the Main Entrance of Cluster B of the Prisons Complex. The victim was escorting the accused for bail in the course of executing his duties as a public servant when the accused first uttered the abusive words. Despite being warned by the victim, the accused persisted in repeating the same abusive words to the victim.

72     The usual tariff for such an offence is a high fine and in some instances a short custodial sentence where the offence is persistent and committed against uniformed officers tasked with maintaining law and order such as police officers or prison officers. In the present case the accused had committed the offence as he was unhappy over the clothes provided by the Singapore Prison Service. The victim was simply carrying out his duties to escort the accused for his bail and had offered a reasonable explanation to the accused’s complaint. There was no reason for the accused to shout abusive words at the victim. Despite being warned by the victim to be careful about the words he used, the accused showed his defiance to authority by repeating the same abusive words albeit in a softer tone. In these circumstances I agreed with the Prosecution that a short custodial sentence of at least one week’s imprisonment was warranted. Accordingly I imposed a sentence of one week’s imprisonment in respect of MAC 912589-2018.

## Global sentence

73     After having decided on the individual sentences for the seven proceeded charges, the next step was to decide on the global sentence. Pursuant to s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012), I ordered the sentences of three charges, namely in DAC-913294-2018, DAC-915888-2018 and MAC-904243-2018 to run consecutively. The sentences for the remaining four charges in DAC-901121-2019, DAC-901127-2019, DAC-913919-2018 and MAC-912589-2018 were to run concurrently. His global sentence was twenty-three months’ imprisonment.

74     In determining the global sentence, I had carefully considered the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct. As highlighted earlier, the accused had series of serious offences _ie_ a total of 23 charges on four separate occasions and all within the month of April 2018. The Prosecution had proceeded on seven of the charges with the remaining 16 charges taken into consideration. Under such circumstances as a matter of general and specific deterrence, it would not be sufficient to order the minimum two sentences to run consecutively. Hence, I ordered the sentence for one of the drug possession charge involving the largest quantity of drugs _ie_ methamphetamine as well as the separate and distinct offences under s 465 Penal Code and s 435 Penal Code to run consecutively.

75     In my view, the individual sentences as well as the global sentence imposed could not be considered as manifestly excessive in light of the circumstances of the present case. It was fortunate that the Prosecution had not proceeded with any drug trafficking charge despite his admission that he would sell or gift the various drugs when asked. This would have attracted the minimum prescribed sentence of five years’ imprisonment with five strokes of the cane.

76     The accused is presently serving his sentence and his earliest date of release is 11 November 2020.
