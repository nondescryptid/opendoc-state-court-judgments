\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9084/2019/01.\]

27 July 2020

### District Judge Kenneth Yap:

The accused in this case was charged with disorderly behaviour in a public place and applying criminal force by spitting at a public servant who was a police officer. The incident took place when two patrolling police officers intervened to break up a scuffle between the accused and two of his drinking companions outside a club at the St James Power Station.

2       The accused faced the following two charges:

> (a)      **MAC 905129-2017** — Behaving in a disorderly manner by repeatedly shouting at the top of his voice, on 24 November 2016, between 2.35 a.m. and 2.40 a.m., outside St James Power Station located at Block 3 Sentosa Gateway, Singapore 098544, which is a public place, contrary to s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Cap 184 (“the s 20 MOA charge”); and

> (b)      **DAC 903414-2018** — Using criminal force on a public servant, namely, Police Sergeant Tan Yew Ann (“PW3 Sgt Tan”) of the Singapore Police Force, by spitting saliva at his face inside Police vehicle bearing registration number QX712B, which was parked at the vicinity of St James Power Station, Singapore, on 24 November 2016 at or before 2.41 a.m. This was an offence under s 353 of the Penal Code, Cap 224 (“the s 353 PC charge”).

3       The accused claimed trial. After hearing the evidence, I convicted the accused of both charges and imposed nine weeks’ imprisonment for the s 353 PC charge, as well as a fine of $1,000 for the s 20 MOA charge (in default of which there would be one weeks’ imprisonment). Dissatisfied with the outcome, the accused has filed an appeal against both conviction and sentence. He is released on bail pending appeal.

### The Agreed Facts

4       The parties agreed to the following background facts.

5       On the evening of 23 November 2016, the accused met up with one Toh Heng Soon (“Toh”), Willie Dai (“Willie”) and Willie’s girlfriend, Germaine Tan Jia Min (“Germaine”) at about 10 p.m. at a bar in Geylang for drinks. Thereafter, the four of them proceeded to the Hollywood Club at St James Power Station, which was located at 3 Sentosa Gateway, Singapore, to have more drinks.

6       At or about 1.00 a.m. on 24 November 2016, the four of them shared two bottles of liquor with mixers. Sometime before 2.30 a.m., the accused and Willie got into a dispute. Willie punched the accused once on his face, and both of them scuffled in the club. Bouncers of the club then intervened and Willie and the accused left the club, followed by Toh and Germaine.

7       Outside the club, a second scuffle ensued between the accused and Willie. Germaine was also involved in this scuffle. The accused ended up pinned on the ground with Willie and Germaine over him.

8       Police officers PW3 Sgt Tan and PW4 SSgt Rauf were performing night shift patrolling duties in their patrol cars at this time. At or about 2.35 a.m., they witnessed the accused and Willie scuffling. They alighted from their patrol cars to intervene and calm the situation down.

9       At about 2.40 a.m., PW4 SSgt Rauf and PW3 Sgt Tan arrested the accused for disorderly behaviour and placed him inside a police patrol car bearing vehicle registration number QX712B. A First Information Report (FIR) bearing Ref: D/20161124/0023 was lodged by PW4 SSgt Rauf at 2.44 a.m. on 24 November 2016 (Exhibit P2). The FIR stated in English “Place 01 subject under arrest for disorderlu (sic) behaviour @0240hrs.” The incident location was given as 3 Sentosa Gateway Saint James Power Station S(098544).

10     An NP299 Arrest Report of the accused (bearing Report No D/20161124/2009) was lodged by PW4 SSgt Rauf on 24 November 2016 at 3.32 a.m. (Exhibit P3).

11     The accused was subsequently seen at Singapore General Hospital Department of Emergency Medicine later that morning (of 24 November 2016) at 11.00 a.m. by Dr Adriel Tay. On 4 January 2017, Dr Tay produced a medical report, stating that: “the Accused was conscious, alert and hemodynamically stable. His Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15. His right eye was red, painful and he was tearing. He had difficulty opening the eye due to pain. No external wounds noted. Visual acuity was intact in both eyes.”[^1] The medical report further stated that he was diagnosed by Dr Edward Marquez of the Singapore National Eye Centre as having corneal abrasion of his right eye.

### The Prosecution’s Case

12     The prosecution led evidence from four witnesses in the course of the trial, namely:

> (a)     PW1 Inspector Thawit Chang (“IO Chang”), who was the investigating officer in charge of the case;

> (b)     PW2 Toh Heng Soon (“Toh”), one of the accused’s drinking companions who was present when the police arrived at the scene;

> (c)     PW3 Sgt Tan Yew Ann (“Sgt Tan”), one of the two arresting officers at the scene; and

> (d)     PW4 SSgt Muhammad Rauf bin Kasmani (“SSgt Rauf”), the other arresting officer at the scene.

13     The key exhibits admitted were:

> (a)     The First Information Report (admitted as Exhibit P2);

> (b)     Two video footages from the body-worn cameras (BWC) of Sgt Tan and SSgt Rauf respectively, contained in a CD-ROM (admitted as Exhibit P4);

> (c)     The Cautioned Statement of the Accused dated 6 June 2017 (admitted as Exhibit P5);

> (d)     The Statement of the Accused recorded on 15 February 2017 (admitted as Exhibit P6); and

> (e)     The Statement of the Accused recorded on 24 November 2016 (admitted as Exhibit P7).

#### The s 20 MOA charge

14     The prosecution’s case for the s 20 MOA charge centred on the footage from the body-worn camera (“BWC”) on PW3 Sgt Tan. In the footage, which lasted over six minutes, it was evident that the accused was shouting at the top of his voice, taunting Willie to come forward in Mandarin/Hokkien (by shouting “lai la”), and hurling Hokkien vulgarities such as “lan jiao” and “ka ni na” at various points between 2.34 a.m. and 2.40 a.m. of 24 November 2016. A full transcript of the six minutes of activity can be found in Annex A of the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions as well as Annex A of the Defence’s Closing Submissions.

15     The identities of the parties and the words uttered in P4 were clarified in the course of the testimonies of Toh, Sgt Tan, SSgt Rauf and the accused. For ease of reference, a (metaphorical) blow-by-blow account is provided below by describing the various sub-episodes in the video with the accompanying timestamps. Where relevant, the dialogue drawn from the transcripts provided by both parties is provided to better understand the context and flavour of what had transpired.

16     At 2:34:09 – 2:34:40, the first video in P4 commences with SSgt Rauf and Sgt Tan arriving at the scene. At this point, Willie had pinned the accused on the floor, while Toh and Germaine were trying to separate them. In the clip, SSgt Rauf is seen bending down, trying to separate Willie and the accused.

17     At 2:34:41 – 2:35:04, as Germaine was holding on to Willie, Sgt Tan is heard telling her to let him go. He pulled Germaine by the arm, and they started shouting at each other. Willie then got back on his feet, and joined Germaine in her argument with Sgt Tan. The following heated exchange took place between them and Sgt Tan during this time:

>   
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

Let go, let go la!

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

_Cheebye_, you so what!

 |
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

What!

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

He is a guy who beat me leh!

 |
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

Why?

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

He is the one who slap her leh!

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

You know or not, he slapped me first hor.

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

He slap her leh, so what.

 |
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

So what, I asked you to let go right!

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

So what, you police officer leh, so what, eh what’s your name ah.

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

Eh, you are the girlfriend, someone slap your girlfriend, you no girlfriend ah?

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Go.. go.. go.. go..

 |
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

Ask you go back, ask you go home, go, go.

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

You got girlfriend or not?

 |

  
  

18     At 2:35:05-23, the accused, who had been separated from Willie, could be heard shouting at Willie. Towards the end of this exchange, Germaine could be seen pulling Willie away from the accused’s direction.

>   
| 

Willie:

 | 

(in Hokkien) You _xia suay_ la, I go down with you, I have your message.

 |
| 

Germaine:

 |

 |
| 

Willie:

 |
| 

Germaine:

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

(in Mandarin) Come lah!

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

(in Mandarin) This is the last time I’ll be drinking with you.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Go back first, go back first

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

(in Mandarin and Hokkien) Don’t pull me!

 |

  
  

19     At 2:35:24 – 39, Willie and the accused continued their verbal exchange, which ended when Sgt Tan asked Toh to pull the accused away. As SSgt Rauf walked towards the accused’s direction, the accused lifted his hands up to indicate compliance.

>   
| 

Willie:

 | 

(in Mandarin) You very _xia suay_, Jerome, _chao chee bye_, got money so what?

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

He beat me first one hor.

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

(in Mandarin and Hokkien) I have money, I am a rich man, I have money, confirm you sit in jail sit until you are mad.

 |
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

(in Mandarin) You pull him in, you pull him in.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Ok, go, go, go.

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

Ok, sorry sorry sorry.

 |

  
  

20     At 02:35:40 – 48, SSgt Rauf pointed at the accused, and issued his first warning against the accused to pipe down or face arrest.

>   
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Ok, what are you trying to prove to me?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

No, no.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Control your friend, can, bring him away, bring him away before I initiate the arrest against both parties.

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

Ok, ok.

 |
| 

Toh:

 | 

Ok, ok.

 |

  
  

21     Over the next minute, at 02:35:48 – 02:36:50, SSgt Rauf walked away from the accused and went to Willie and Germaine, trying to get them to move in the other direction in order to diffuse the situation. As Germaine spoke to SSgt Rauf in a mixture of Malay and English, the accused could be heard in the background shouting at Willie.

>   
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

(in Mandarin) You, bring her home.

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

(in Mandarin) He came at me first, if not my boyfriend….

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

Bro, you police officer, Sir, I ask you something.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Both go one side first can?

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

(to Willie) No, wait, listen.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Move one side first, move one side first, move one side first.

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

Listen, he went off.

 |
| 

Willie:

 |

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Move one side first, I will talk.

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

(to Willie) You go there first.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Move one side first.

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

He slap you leh.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Can you please bring your boyfriend out here I need to talk to him first, possible? Is it ok?

 |
| 

Germaine:

 |

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

(in background) Oi, I want to, I want to call ambulance now, (loudly in Mandarin) _lai la_ (come la!)

 |
| 

Germaine:

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

No no… You… You… You go there first, you go talk to your boyfriend, you boyfriend really..

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

He is drunk, yes.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 |

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

(in Malay) Cannot.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

(unintelligible in Malay)

 |
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

(in Mandarin) You just go there first, you just go there first.

 |

  
  

22     From 02:36:50 – 02:37:24, SSgt Rauf turned his attention back towards the accused, who was sitting on the floor. However, the accused, while interacting with SSgt Rauf and Sgt Tan, was still shouting at Willie.

>   
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Brother brother…(\*unintelligible) All of you guys are patrons right?

 |
| 

Toh:

 | 

What is patron?

 |
| 

Sgt Tan:

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

Accused:

Ok la, that’s fine that’s fine, no la, that’s fine that’s fine.

(in Mandarin) Ok, steady, Willie, you go.

| 

SSgt Rauf:

You bring him to the corner.

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

(in Hokkien) Willie, you go. **You what, you want to come is it?** **_Lai la!_** **(Come la!)** \[_Emphasis added_\]

 |

  
  

23     From 02:37:25 to 02:38:07, SSgt Rauf turned his attention back towards Willie and Germaine, both of whom were trying to point out to him that the accused was the aggressor. In the background, the accused could be heard shouting loudly and taunting Willie three times.

>   
| 

Germaine:

 | 

Shh shh.. I don’t want to go in already.

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

Asking for sympathy ah.

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

I don’t want to go in anymore.

 |
| 

Willie:

 | 

No, I also don’t want to go in.

 |
| 

Germaine:

 |
| 

Rauf:

 | 

(to Willie) The more you are here ah …

 |
| 

Accused:

(shouting in background in Mandarin)

**Come la! (** **_Lai ah_** **!)**

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Never mind, you look at your girlfriend, look at your girlfriend and just move on.

 |
| 

Germaine:

 | 

Shh, shh.

 |
| 

Accused:

(shouting in background in Mandarin and Hokkien)

**Lai La! Lim peh ka li gong hor. (** **_Come lah. I told you already!)_**

 |
| 

 | 

\[_Emphasis added_\]

 |

  
  

24     From 02:38:08 to 02:38:37, SSgt Rauf turned his attention back to the accused in an attempt to stop him shouting at Willie, then turned to Willie to try and get him to calm down and back away. However, the accused continued to taunt and rile Willie twice.

>   
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Eh brother, don’t drama can or not? Don’t drama please \*inaudible\*

 |
| 

Willie:

 |

| 

Sgt Tan:

| 

Accused:

 |
| 

Willie:

 |
| 

Germaine:

(shouts in Hokkien) **You want to come, come ah! (****_ai lai ah, lai ah!_****)**

 |
| 

 | 

\[_Emphasis added_\]

 |

  
  

25     From 02:38:37 to 02:39:29, SSgt Rauf returned to the accused, who continued taunting Willie. SSgt Rauf then issued a second threat to arrest the accused if he did not calm down.

>   
| 

SSgt Rauf:

 | 

Eh brother, can steady or not?

Accused:

Sgt Tan:

You go away.

 |
| 

\[_Emphasis added_\]

 |

  
  

26     Despite these efforts and warnings, from 02:39:30 to 02:40:12, the accused continued to shout at Willie, which led to his eventual arrest and handcuffing by SSgt Rauf.

>   
| 

Accused:

 | 

(in Hokkien) **Eh, Willie, want to come ah, come lor!**

OK, sir, cuff, cuff me.

 |
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

You want us to get back up?

 |
| 

Willie:

 |

Accused:

(screaming in Mandarin and Hokkien) **Fuck your mother (****_kan ni na_****), come la, come la!**

(in Mandarin) Come!

Ok, I stand there.

 |
| 

Toh:

Accused:

 |
| 

Sgt Tan:

 | 

I asked you to go back right, you don’t want to go back what right.

 |
| 

SSgt Rauf:

Arresting one subject. \*inaudible\*

 |
|

\[_Emphasis added_\]

27     From 02:40:13 – 02:41:22, the accused repeatedly asked for his spectacles as he was arrested by SSgt Rauf and escorted by him to the police car. SSgt Rauf acknowledged that Toh would look for the accused’s spectacles, whereupon the accused agreed to get into the police car. The video then ends at 02:41:22.

28     At this point, it is an agreed fact that there was a break of 55 seconds between both video clips from the body-worn cameras where no footage existed.

29     What happens next forms the basis for the s 353 PC charge. The primary evidence for the offence derives from the testimony of PW3 Sgt Tan. In his evidence-in-chief, Sgt Tan described how he had placed the accused on the left back seat of the police vehicle, QX712B. He then went to the right side of the vehicle and entered through the back door to put the safety belt over the accused and buckle him up. Sgt Tan explained that it was his duty to ensure that the accused was safely secured before they could drive off. According to Sgt Tan, after he had buckled the accused up and was retreating back to his seat, but before he had sat down, he suddenly felt saliva on his face and hands. He was aware that it was saliva because it had a very strong alcoholic smell[^2]. He was certain that it was not accidental as there were specks of saliva on his spectacles, face and hand, and he had also heard a “_ptooey_” sound which was the sound of the spit. He described that at the point of spitting, his shoulders were facing front but his neck and shoulders were slightly turned to face the accused. After the spitting incident, Sgt Tan wiped himself clean before reaching out to PW4 SSgt Rauf to inform him of what had happened. Sgt Tan also testified that he had had felt humiliated after the accused had spat on him, but had to maintain his professionalism and remain calm throughout the rest of the incident.

30     This spitting incident was not captured on any of the BWC camera footage, as it had occurred during a 55-second gap between the end of PW3 Sgt Tan’s BWC footage (at 2:41:22) and the start of PW4 SSgt Rauf’s BWC footage (at 2:42:18). In SSgt Rauf’s footage, which was taken from outside of the police vehicle QX712B from the back left door, Sgt Tan was seen emerging from the right side of the vehicle and clearly saying “_He spit at me_” at 2:42:24. Following this, SSgt Rauf’s camera was then mounted within the vehicle, and continued to run while the accused remained in the car and was driven to the police station.

31     Three points of note arise from the long clip that follows. First, the accused was able to converse with Toh and the police officers while seated in the car, and throughout the journey to the police station. He can be heard, before the car moved off, denying any wrongdoing, complaining that his eye hurt, and asking to be released. Second, it was noteworthy that the accused displayed a measure of defiance and condescension during parts of the conversation. At 2:50:33 to 2:50:51, the following exchange took place between Sgt Tan and the accused:

Sgt Tan:

 |
| 

Accused:

Sgt Tan:

| 

Sgt Tan:

 |

  
  

32     At trial, it was never the accused’s case that the police had hit him on any occasion during the incident.

33     Later, the accused’s tone turned sarcastic towards Sgt Tan on two occasions. During the journey, at 2:53:20 to 2:54:48, the accused asked for and repeated Sgt Tan’s name while muttering derogatory terms in Hokkien under his breath.

34     The accused’s in-car soliloquy continued from 2:55:04 to 2:56:12, where he said:

35     The third observation I would make regarding this part of the incident is the behaviour of the accused when he arrived at the police station. Upon arrival, the accused was requested 2:59:21 to leave the vehicle by a police officer, but he claimed that “my leg hurts a lot”. When assistance was offered, the accused shouted out repeatedly in apparent pain and refused to let the police officers assist him out of the car. The stand-off continued for over two minutes as the police sought to persuade him to leave the vehicle voluntarily to no avail, as the accused continued shouting at the top of his voice and refusing to budge. Eventually, more officers arrived and attempted to push the accused out of the car at 3:04:02, during which time the accused was heard to be shouting and resisting while asking for an ambulance. It is not until 3:05:30 when the officers finally succeeded in removing him from the police vehicle. It is notable that the accused had been seen walking normally towards the vehicle when he was arrested, and no allegation was made or explanation given at trial as to why he felt his leg was so painful that he was unable to exit the vehicle. Neither was such injury recorded in the medical examination which took place later that morning.

36     Apart from the video footage tendered at trial, the prosecution also adduced two statements by the accused in a bid to persuade the court to impeach his credibility. The accused’s cautioned statement (Exhibit P5) in response to the s 353 charge, dated 6 June 2017, was admitted and its contents were confirmed by the accused. The relevant extract is as follows:

> I deny the charge. I did not spit at the police officer…. I not spit at any police officer during the course of my arrest. Also, while in the police car, I did not spit at any police officer. Each of the police who had arrested me had on them video recording devices. If I had indeed spit at the police officer, it would have been caught on the video recordings. I believe that the camera recordings captured no such act of me spitting at the police officers.

37     The prosecution then admitted the first statement recorded by IO Chang on 24 November 2016 under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act to impeach the accused’s credibility. In his first statement, recorded on the day of the incident at Clementi Police Division, the accused was able to recount the events preceding his arrest. When asked in the statement whether he had challenged and shouted at the arresting officers, the accused replied “I cannot remember”. When asked why he had refused to cooperate with the officers when advised to do so, he said “I was too drunk”. When asked whether he had spat at a police officer in the police vehicle, he stated “I cannot remember”. When asked why the accused had no recollection of the spitting incident in his first statement, but was sure that he had not done so in his cautioned statement, the accused explained it had been more than 36 hours since he had last slept when his first statement was recorded at 11 am on 24 November 2016, and that he was tired, hung over and not thinking straight at that point. He also explained that he did not know it was possible to amend his statement after it was recorded.

### The Defence’s Case

38     The accused took the stand in his own defence. He did not call any other witnesses. While he did not deny the conduct he had displayed in the footage, he explained that the shouting was directed towards Willie and Germaine and was explicable in the context of the alleged assault by them prior to the arrival of the police. With regard to the alleged spitting incident, the accused steadfastly maintained that he did not knowingly spit at Sgt Tan, and confirmed the contents of his cautioned statement.

39     The accused explained that when inside the Club, he had gotten into a dispute with Willie over his attempts to locate his lighter, which was of sentimental value to him. According to the accused, Willie got so frustrated with his queries about his lighter that he punched the accused on the face. Bouncers of the Club then intervened, and the pair left then club, followed by Toh and Germaine. Outside, a scuffle ensued between Willie and the accused, in which Germaine got involved. During this scuffle, the accused claimed that Willie had injured his right eye with a punch. The accused was lying on the floor with Willie and Germaine over him when the police arrived.

40     The accused pointed out that the first portion of footage retrieved from Sgt Tan’s BWC captures Willie and Germaine behaving aggressively and shouting at the police officers, and that, even in the presence of the police, they initially did not desist from wrestling with the accused. In the course of cross-examination, he also denied that he was challenging the police officers to arrest him, and it was argued by the defence that this was in any case irrelevant to the factual inquiry as the charge related to disorderly behaviour only.

41     While the accused did not deny his actions as captured in the BWC footage, it was argued by the defence that in relation to the s 20 MOA offence that (i) the threshold for disorderly behaviour had not been crossed as the accused was shouting at Willie and Germaine and not at the police officers or members of the public, and (ii) there was no evidence of the effect of the allegedly disorderly behaviour had on members of the public. In furtherance of this latter argument, the defence pointed out that no members of public had complained about the disorder conduct throughout the incident. Sgt Rauf had testified that there were about four patrons and some passers-by who were around the area, who only turned to look when either the accused or Willie were shouting. Sgt Rauf further characterised the human traffic as “intermediate”, and that while there were patrons moving from the clubs in the vicinity, it was not crowded at that time.

42     To substantiate his claims that he was injured in the scuffle prior to the arrival of the police officers, the accused adduced the medical report (Exhibit D1) of Dr Adriel Tay of the Singapore General Hospital, who examined the accused at 11:00 am on the day of the incident. The doctor noted that the accused was “conscious, alert and hemodynamically stable”. It was recorded that the accused’s right eye was red, painful, and that he was tearing and had difficulty opening the eye due to pain. Visual acuity was intact in both eyes, and no external wounds were noted. He was referred to an ophthalmologist on duty at the Singapore National Eye Centre, and was found to have corneal abrasion of his right eye. He was then discharged with antibiotic and lubricant eye drops, to be followed up with outpatient treatment.

43     In respect of the s 353 Penal Code charge, the accused denied spitting at Sgt Tan in the police vehicle, and it was submitted that any spittle that had landed on Sgt Tan’s face was unintentional. As mentioned earlier, the accused explained that he had not denied the spitting in the first statement taken by the police because he was sleep-deprived and hung over, although by the recording of the cautioned statement, he was certain in his recollection that no such intentional spitting had occurred.

44     It was further argued by the defence that Sgt Tan’s evidence contained internal inconsistencies, and that there were certain contradictions in the prosecution’s case.

45     First, it was argued that Sgt Tan’s account contradicted what was contained in the Case for the Prosecution, which stated that Sgt Tan was _in the process of_ buckling the accused’s seatbelt when the accused suddenly spat saliva at his face. However, Sgt Tan testified in court that the alleged spit occurred _after_ he had placed the seatbelt on the accused. The defence accordingly made an application under s 169(1)(c) of the CPC, asking the court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution.

46     Second, it was argued by the defence that Sgt Tan had presented contradicting versions of the events during his EIC and cross-examination. The first alleged inconsistency related to Sgt Tan’s position when he was allegedly spat at. In his evidence-in-chief, Sgt Tan had explained that the spit occurred as he was _retreating_ back to his seat after buckling the accused’s seat belt. According to Sgt Tan, “that point of time after buckle him up, I wanted to retreat back to my seat to have a seat, however I suddenly felt saliva on my face and hands.”[^3] However, it was pointed out by the defence that Sgt Tan had also appeared to state in his EIC that he was sitting when the spitting incident occurred. Sgt Tan had described that he was “sitting on the other side of the vehicle which is about an arm length. I don’t uh, it’s very import – it’s impossible for him to talk and the saliva to land so far also.”[^4] He then confirmed when questioned by the court that “we would, uh, sit like that and that I would turn and talk to Jerome.”[^5] When asked to clarify the apparent inconsistency, Sgt Tan explained, “I can defined seat in my own way. If I retreat back to the seat, it doesn’t mean I really have to sit down”[^6]. Sgt Tan further confirmed when questioned by the court that by the word “sitting” he had meant that he had not planted himself on the seat yet but was in the act of planting himself on the seat[^7]. The defence submitted that Sgt Tan had prevaricated in his evidence and that this explanation was not satisfactory.

47     In the alternative, it was submitted by the defence that even if the Sgt Tan had felt something land on him, he had been mistaken that the accused had intentionally applied criminal force by spitting on his face. At the time, the visibility was poor, and it Sgt Tan had not actually seen the alleged act as he was not looking directly at Sgt Tan at that time. It was suggested by the accused that it could have been other bodily fluids that landed on Sgt Tan while the accused was speaking, panting and sweating during the time he was seated at the back of the police vehicle. Even though Sgt Tan believed it was saliva because it had a strong alcoholic smell, it was suggested that this could be because the accused was reeking of alcohol. As regards Sgt Tan’s recollection that he had heard a “pooey” sound, it was pointed out that Sgt Tan had confirmed that the environment was noisy, and that the accused would have been panting while seated inside the police vehicle.

### My Decision

48     At the close of the trial, I found that the prosecution had proven the elements of both charges beyond reasonable doubt, and convicted the accused accordingly on both counts.

49     I turn first to explain my decision on the s 20 MOA charge. Two elements are necessary to establish this charge, namely that:

> (a)     The accused displayed disorderly behaviour; and

> (b)     The display occurred in a public place.

50     The evidence with respect to the s 20 MOA is largely uncontroverted. The video taken by Sgt Tan’s body-worn camera speaks for itself and its contents were accepted by the accused. I also found PW3 Sgt Tan and PW4 SSgt Rauf to be credible and consistent witnesses, and had no reason to doubt their characterisation of the events that night as they reviewed the video footage in excruciating detail. It was also clear to my mind that they had no ulterior motive to falsely implicate the accused. In fact, neither of them had the initial intent to arrest the parties. Indeed, SSgt Rauf had given the accused three warnings before finally arresting him to stop him from causing further public disturbance.

51     The one and only issue that is germane to the s 20 MOA charge is whether the accused’s conduct crossed the threshold for “disorderly behaviour” in a public place. While “disorderly behaviour” is not statutorily defined, the court in _PP v Wong Hong Ming & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGMC 3</span> made some general observations about what would constitute such behaviour (see \[90\]-\[92\]):

> (a)     First, there was no requirement that a breach of peace had to be committed. Less aggressive conduct was sufficient so long as it contravened the rules of good order and behaviour, or was such as to tend to disturb the peace or interfere with the comfort of others in the area.

> (b)     Second, what is disorderly behaviour is a matter of degree, and judgment of the conduct in question must depend on the relevant time, place and circumstances.

> (c)     Third, the conduct must, at the very least, create some sort of annoyance and disturbance to other members of public who were in that area so as to justify the intervention of the criminal law.

52     The gist of the defence in this case is that the accused’s vitriolic conduct was directed towards Willie and Germaine, rather than at the two police officers. It was also argued that the accused’s conduct had to be seen in the light of his being outnumbered and assaulted by Willie and Germaine before the arrival of the police officers, and his vigorous shouting and taunting was considered a reasonable reaction under the circumstances.

53     I accepted that in so far as the scuffle outside the Club was concerned, the accused was aggravated and aggrieved as he had been pinned to the floor and injured in his right eye as a result of the scuffle. Indeed, Sgt Tan had described how he saw Willie and Germaine on top of the accused, and had agreed that the accused was in a helpless position as he was pinned to the ground while lying on his back.

54     I fully agree with the defence that the expectation of what is proper behaviour depends very much on the context. In a situation where one is pinned to the ground and assaulted, bereft of the assistance of passers-by or the police, it would be entirely forgivable for that person to shout or raise a ruckus in protest. Under such circumstances, a spirited resistance by the disadvantaged party would not give cause for an offence.

55     I further noted that upon the arrival of the two police officers, Willie and Germaine did not desist immediately, and instead continued to contribute their fair share to the exchange of colourful words with the accused. It was not until the combined efforts of Toh and the two police officers led to the successful separation of the parties that they quietened down. The fact that Willie or Germaine were not similarly charged as the accused is of course a matter within the province of prosecutorial discretion, although I do venture to surmise that this was because their behaviour was far less aggravated, having calmed down once separated from the accused.

56     To my mind, the distinguishing factor in this case is that the accused continued in his belligerent behaviour despite being out of harm’s way and separated from his alleged aggressors. Indeed, Willie had from 02:36:16 essentially disengaged with the accused by walking away from the accused and crossing the road. There was therefore no justification for the accused to continue acting in such a belligerent manner.

57     The assessment of whether the threshold of disorderly behaviour has been crossed ultimately depends on societal expectations of behaviour in the particular context. Some illumination for how this test is to be applied can be gleaned from the case of _Mesler v Police_ \[1967\] NZLR 437 in the New Zealand Court of Appeal, where North J opined that “not only must the behaviour seriously offend against those values of orderly conduct which are recognised by right-thinking members of the public but it must at least be of a character which is likely to cause annoyance to others who are present.” In a similar vein, Turner J observed in that case that disorderly conduct “is conduct which, while sufficiently ill-mannered, or in bad taste, to meet with the disapproval of well-conducted and reasonable men and women, is also something more – it must in my opinion, tend to annoy or insult such persons as are faced with it – and sufficiently deeply or seriously to warrant the interference of the criminal law.”

58     Put another way, the s 20 MOA offence sets the standard for preservation of public peace and order, with the litmus test being what a right-minded person would conceive as reasonable behaviour, especially in the context where police officers were present. In _Wong Hong Ming_, the court observed that the mere act of ‘talking’ back to police officers, gesturing and laughing when they were standing at arms-length after exiting a taxi at a road block, was not sufficient conduct to warrant a conviction under s 20 of the MOA. The court noted in that case that no evidence had been led by the prosecution of any annoyance that had been caused to members of the public. It was regarded by the court that the accused persons in _Wong Hong Ming_ were merely trying to stand up for themselves and reason their way out of a difficult situation, especially as they regarded themselves as having been treated in a high-handed manner by the police.

59     The case was quite different in _Chee Soon Juan & Anor v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGDC 288</span>. The court in that case considered that the second accused, by shouting at the top of his voice and gesticulating with his hands at the main gate of the Istana in the midst of a crowded Labour Day event, had crossed the line and committed an offence under s 20 MOA. In convicting him of the s 20 MOA charge, the court noted that the second accused had been warned by the police to go away or be arrested, but had nevertheless continued to shout even after he was arrested and led away to the police van (at \[45\]).

60     No two fact situations are alike, and context is everything. The present case occurred on the side of a public road outside a concentration of pubs and bars at the St James Power Station. There was evidence by the police officers that there were onlookers observing the altercation. Indeed, the police officers were concerned that if the incident were not contained, there might be a risk of escalation with the involvement of other patrons nearby.

61     It is axiomatic that some leeway for rowdy and rambunctious behaviour is afforded in such entertainment districts. One expects a fair degree of boisterous and exuberant behaviour on the part of revellers, and a right-thinking member of public in such a place would shrug off behaviour that would otherwise have been frowned upon in a more placid venue, such as a public library or a shopping mall. But I do not think such good-natured latitude extends to shouting expletive-laden taunts that have the propensity to incite violence. Behaviour of this nature discolours the atmosphere of good cheer and clean fun that should be the defining hallmark of such establishments.

62     Further, I was of the view that the bar for acceptable behaviour should be raised with the arrival of the police, which should have had a sobering effect on all parties concerned. At this point, the accused, being under police protection, had no cause to continue his tirades against Willie and Germaine, especially in the face of multiple warnings by SSgt Rauf to keep quiet or face arrest. There was no suggestion that the accused was standing up for his rights as was the case in _Wong Hong Ming_. Instead, his actions were in complete disregard of the heightened standards of behaviour that should be expected once a uniformed police officer arrives at the scene. Any member of public passing by the scene would have been immeasurably appalled and disturbed to witness such lack of restraint and respect, in the face of multiple intervention and warnings given by the police. To countenance otherwise would be to accept a situation of absolute anarchy at night spots, and to render intolerable the efforts of police officers striving to preserve public order and protect the well-being of party goers at such locales.

63     For these reasons, I had no doubt the accused’s conduct that evening was a quintessential example of disorderly conduct under s 20 MOA, and I convicted him accordingly.

64     Turning to the s 353 offence, I would preface my grounds by highlighting the three essential elements that the prosecution must prove to establish such a charge, per the High Court decision in _Goh Ang Huat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 1</span>, i.e. that:

> (a)     The victim of the criminal force was a public servant,

> (b)     The accused had used criminal force upon such a public servant,

> (c)     The public servant was in the execution of his duty as such public servant.

65     There is no doubt in this case that Sgt Tan was a public servant and was acting in such capacity at the relevant time. The critical question before the court was whether the accused had intentionally or knowingly spat at Sgt Tan while in the back of the police car.

66     There is no dispute that the act of spitting at someone clearly falls within the definition of criminal force under the Penal Code, which specifies in s 350 that “whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person’s consent, in order to cause the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force illegally to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will illegally cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force us used, is said to use criminal force to that other.”

67     The accused’s account and that of Sgt Tan’s are however diametrically opposed on this matter. The accused denies the act, while Sgt Tan is certain that it happened. As the act of spitting was not caught by the body-worn cameras or observed by SSgt Rauf, the prosecution’s case turns entirely on the veracity of the testimony of Sgt Tan. While he did not actually see the accused spitting at him, he was adamant on the stand that this had happened because (i) he knew it was saliva because it smelt of alcohol, (ii) he heard a “ptooey” sound, and (iii) he was certain from what had landed on his face that it was spittle. He was also heard on the body-worn camera footage informing SSgt Rauf that the accused had spat at him.

68     The defence understandably spared no effort casting doubt on the reliability of Sgt Tan’s testimony in every manner possible. A considerable amount of ink was spilled on apparent inconsistencies between the Prosecution’s Case and Sgt Tan’s evidence in court relating to _when_ the spitting had allegedly occurred, the _distance_ between the accused and Sgt Tan when it allegedly occurred, and _whether_ Sgt Tan had cleaned it off before reporting the incident to SSgt Rauf.

69     I shall deal first with the critique over _when_ the alleged spitting had occurred. I note that the Case for the Prosecution (admitted as Exhibit D6) was framed broadly in that it described Sgt Tan as being “_in the process of_ buckling the accused’s seat belt for him when the accused suddenly spat saliva onto the victim’s face.” (emphasis added) Nevertheless, I was extremely hard-pressed to find that this broad description “differs from or is otherwise inconsistent with the Case for the Prosecution”, which is the threshold to be passed before an adverse inference can be drawn under s 169(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code. It would not be an overly generous interpretation to consider “in the process of” to refer to the entire act of reaching over to buckle the seat belt before returning to a seating position. It would to my mind be an unnecessary and somewhat uncharitable view to fault the Prosecution on such a disagreement on semantics. Indeed I do not see any prejudice caused even if the defence had chosen to read this description in the narrow manner as they had done.

70     In much of a similar vein, I considered that the apparent inconsistencies in Sgt Tan’s evidence, where he had described himself both as _sitting_ as well as _retreating back_ to his seat when the spitting occurred, were not material enough to consider an impeachment of his credibility. Sgt Tan had explained that what he had described as sitting could encompass the act of retreating back to the seat as well. I would attribute any apparent discrepancy to Sgt Tan’s weaker command of English[^8] and his inability to grasp the wordplay involved during cross-examination on this point. His evident frustration at reliving what he clearly felt was an extremely humiliating incident may also have contributed to a somewhat incoherent explanation to the defence’s repeated questions on this point. For these reasons, I was prepared to accept that when Sgt Tan described his act of sitting, he was actually referring to the act of retreating back from having leaned over to fix the seat belt over the accused.

71     The second point of contention raised by the defence was the inaccuracy of Sgt Tan’s initial description that the closest distance between his face and the accused’s face when the alleged spitting took place was about 60 cm. After some rather complex calculations involving a simulated demonstration in court, it was put to Sgt Tan that the closest distance was actually between 40-46 cm, a point to which he expressed agreement[^9]. When queried about this difference in position, Sgt Tan explained that he had meant “around 60 cm”, and that he could not be sure of the exact length, but that it was about “my arm’s length”[^10]. As I had noted to counsel in the somewhat lengthy exchange in court on this matter, the simulation designed by the defence was based on certain assumptions about the exact seating position of the accused on the leftmost seat, as well as the actual space available between the front and back rows of the car seats in the police vehicle on that day. Given these variables and the hectic pace of events that night, I am unable to nit-pick and find fault with the rough estimate made by Sgt Tan on the relative distance between the accused and himself at the time. What is most important is that, given the tight confines of the back of the police vehicle, it was neither impossible nor improbable that Sgt Tan was within spitting range of the accused.

72     The third and final point of contention raised against Sgt Tan’s testimony involved the timing of the events, specifically, why he said that he “immediately” told SSgt about the spit when he also testified that he had taken up to 20-30 seconds to clean it off first, and also how Sgt Tan could have gotten the accused seated, crossed over to the other side of the car, buckled him down, been spat on, and cleaned off the spittle within the 55 second gap between the body-worn camera footages. It was explained by Sgt Tan that when he said “immediately”, he meant that he did so immediately after he had cleaned the spittle from his face, which would seem to be the most natural and sensible reaction in my mind. I also declined to dwell at length on the mechanics of time and space within the 55 second gap between the BWC footages and the additional six seconds of footage in the second BWC recording before Sgt Tan is heard reporting the spitting to SSgt Rauf. I would confine myself to the observation that the sequence of events detailed by Sgt Tan was perfectly plausible within the space of 61 seconds, and it would not be profitable to split hairs any further on the exact timings.

73     In summary, I found the defence’s criticisms of Sgt Tan’s testimony to be unfounded. In no way did they detract from the critical observation that Sgt Tan did contemporaneously report the spitting incident to his senior, SSgt Rauf, moments after it had occurred. Sgt Tan was also unwavering in his conviction that he _was_ spat at intentionally. He explained that he had felt humiliated at the scene because he was certain the spitting was intentional. His response during cross-examination on this point bears repetition in full:

> I felt -- like I mentioned, the difference between someone spitting and someone accidentally spitting on you is totally different. If someone were to spit directly on the face, you would feel embarrassed. So, if – there’s countless of times you guys trying to ask me if it’s accidental spit, I keep saying that it’s not accidental because I felt humiliated. I know – first time in my life, I’ve --- I know how it’s being --- hot it is being spat at. [^11]

74     I found Sgt Tan to be a cogent witness who had no motive either on the night in question or on the stand to fabricate testimony against the accused. His frustration on the stand at having to relive what he described to be a humiliating incident was evident, as was his adamantly expressed view that he did not deserve to be spat on in the line of duty.

75     I would think the above puts beyond doubt the reliability of Sgt Tan’s testimony but I would be remiss if I did not add that the accused’s behaviour on the journey to and arriving at the police station adds to the overall impression of his utter disdain and disrespect for police authority. His strident and arrogant attitude, already evident during the initial episode for which was charged, was on full display during the sarcastic and condescending exchange he shared with Sgt Tan during the car journey. His exaggerated screaming over what was obviously a false claim of leg pain on arrival at the police station further confirms his obstructionist attitude towards police authority. While his actions subsequent to the incident are not directly relevant to the charges in question, they do the accused no favours. They serve to confirm the initial impression created during the incident that he was the kind of person who acted in complete contempt and defiance of police authority.

76     I would also add as a post script that as regards the prosecution’s submission that the accused had changed his position between his first statement (where he claimed to have had no recollection of spitting) and his cautioned statement and court testimony (where he claimed that no intentional spitting had occurred), I would decline to draw an adverse inference as requested. The accused had explained that he was tired and hung over at the time of recording of the first statement, and I was prepared to afford him the benefit of the doubt that he was indeed unable to recollect with any accuracy the incidents of the night before on the very morning after.

77     Taken as a whole, I do find that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the accused was guilty of the s 353 charge. Accordingly, at the close of the trial, I found that the prosecution had made out its case beyond reasonable doubt on both charges and convicted the accused accordingly.

### Antecedents

78     In 2016, the accused was convicted of the following charges and sentenced as follows:

> (a)     Assault or use of criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty under s 353 of the Penal Code (imprisonment term of two weeks)

> (b)     Voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code (imprisonment term of four weeks, to run consecutively with the sentence for s 353 charge)

> (c)     S 13D(1)(a) of the MOA for using indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour towards a public servant (fine of $1,000).

79     Three other charges, one from each of the above categories, were also taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

80     On 9 March 2017, the accused was convicted of driving a vehicle when the proportion of alcohol in his body exceeded the prescribed limit, pursuant to s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276), and was fined $2,300, as well as disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for 20 months.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

81     The prosecution sought a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment for the s 353 charge, and a high fine for the s 20 MOA charge (the maximum fine being $2,000 under the provision).

82     The learned prosecutor submitted that general and specific deterrence should constitute the primary sentencing consideration in this case. From the point of view of general deterrence, it was noted that police officers faced the risk of verbal and physical abuse in the discharge of their duties, and should be protected adequately by the law. Reference was made to the case of _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span>, where Tay Yong Kwang JA had noted \[at 50\] that:

> Police officers must therefore be assured of adequate protection and vindication by the law against behaviour that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties.

83     With regard to specific deterrence, it was pointed out that the accused had committed a similar s 353 offence in 2016, and was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.

84     The prosecution explained that an uplift to 12 weeks’ imprisonment was sought as spitting should be considered as an aggravating factor. Aside from being humiliating and degrading, and demonstrating utter disrespect and contempt to police authority, there was the added danger of the risk of transmission of disease through the passing of bodily fluids. It was therefore to be considered a more egregious form of criminal force than a push or slap.

85     The prosecution also tendered a table of precedents which showed that the range of sentences imposed in cases involving pleas of guilt for s 353 charges involved sentences ranging from six to 16 weeks. The learned prosecutor pointed out that this case merited a higher sentence as it involved conviction after trial. A summarised version of the table is provided for convenient reference:

### Mitigation Plea

86     Learned counsel for the defence submitted an oral mitigation plea, and urged the court to consider the following points:

> (a)     The offences occurred due to the culmination of events where an innocuous evening out ended in a scuffle between the accused and Willie and Germaine, with the accused being punched in the face and suffering a corneal abrasion.

> (b)     The accused should not be unduly punished by having a heavier sentence simply because he elected to claim trial.

87     In relation to the s 20 MOA charge, given the events that had transpired in the lead-up to the offence, the defence asked for no more than a fine between $600 to $800.

88     For the s 353 charge, the defence submitted that there were no aggravating factors in this case. There was no injury suffered by Sgt Tan, as a spit involved only minimum contact. It was also pointed out that the accused did not resist arrest in the commission of the offence, nor did he demonstrate any aggression towards the officers.

89     The defence sought to rely on the case of _PP v Steven Albert_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 246</span> (MA 9254/2017), where a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment was enhanced to four weeks’ imprisonment on appeal even though the facts were, in the view of the defence, far more serious than those in the present case. In _PP v Stephen Albert_, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 353 for spitting at a police officer and a second charge under s 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 254A). A further charge of spitting under s 353 was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. It was noted that there were two spitting occasions in this case, and that racial insults were made and vulgarities used. On this basis, the defence submitted that the sentence in the present case should be lower than that of _PP v Stephen Albert_, as it involved only one incident of spitting and did not demonstrate the same level of outright defiance.

90     In response to this argument, the learned prosecutor pointed out that the accused in _PP v Steven Albert_ was a 20 year old first-time offender, and for whom rehabilitation sentences were not appropriate as he was a foreigner. The prosecution also disagreed that the accused in the present case was any less defiant of authority, pointing out that he had shown disrespect to the police from the start of their intervention until after his arrival at the police station. It was also highlighted that the accused was a repeat offender, and his s 353 antecedent involved the punching of an officer.

### The Sentence

91     I did not think there was any doubt that the principles of general and specific deterrence would be the primary sentencing considerations that applied to this case.

92     The case for general deterrence is clear. While the case of _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ involved a charge of causing hurt to a public servant under s 332 of the Penal Code, the guidance provided by the High Court holds true even where the application of criminal force is concerned. The need for the law to protect and deter abuse directed at police officers was made amply apparent by Tay Yong Kwang JA (at \[49\]), and His Honour’s words are equally applicable to and bear repetition in the present case:

> Attacks against police officers can have several undesirable consequences at a societal level. First, the incidents of attack, if left unchecked, could undermine public confidence in our police officers as authority figures in society and compromise their effectiveness as a symbol of law and order. Second, with manpower constraints resulting in an already lean police-to-population ratio in Singapore, the continued abuse of police officers will have an adverse impact on the SPF’s recruitment efforts. In the long term, this will have repercussions for the operational effectiveness of the police and will affect the country adversely as a whole. Third, challenges to the authority of the police pose a real risk of defensive policing. It would be unfortunate and undesirable if our police officers feel the need too easily and too often to draw their weapons or to use force in reaction to any perceived danger. All these issues are compounded by the increasingly complex and uncertain security environment with which modern-day policing is presented in a densely populated country, where emergency situations could arise at any time with dire consequences for the public.

93     Having perused the table of sentencing precedents provided by the Prosecution, I was mindful that a starting point of at least six weeks’ imprisonment should apply even where a first-time offender pleaded guilty to a charge of using criminal force by spitting at a public servant who was a police officer. The act of spitting is targeted to degrade and humiliate the intended target, and is often the last act of defiance of a handcuffed arrestee. Unless the police resorted to gagging all inebriated arrestees, there was no effective remedy against this occupational risk. Further, the act is particularly egregious when directed at the face of a police officer, for when saliva comes into direct contact with the victim’s eyes of mouth, there is a real risk of transmission of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, should there be mucosal contact (through the conjunctiva or the mouth) with blood stained bodily fluid.

94     I was cognisant of the fact that the sentence for such first-timer offenders could be even higher than six weeks’ imprisonment where aggravated circumstances exist. For example, in _PP v Muhammad Idris Bin_ Osman (DAC 904954-2017), the offender was given eight weeks’ imprisonment for spitting _twice_ at police officers in the police car. In _Jailani Bin Syed Ibrahim_ (DAC 939072-2016), the sentence was 12 weeks’ imprisonment for an offender who spat at a police officer _within the police station_. Finally, in _Jeffridin Bin Ramli_ (DAC 919588-2017), the punishment was as high as 16 weeks’ imprisonment for a first-time offender as the accused who spat at the police officer was diagnosed with Hepatitis-C.

95     I did consider the relatively lower sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment in the case of _PP v Steven Albert_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 246</span> (unreported, MA 9254/2017) referred to by the defence. However, I agreed with the prosecution that this case presented as an outlier. It involved a 20-year old Indonesian national who had completed his studies in Singapore, and for whom the pre-sentence report had noted (at \[19\]) that probation was not a feasible option as the accused’s student pass had expired and there was no possibility of appointing a suitable guardian or bailor in Singapore. It was also noted by the district court that the accused had pleaded guilty, was genuinely remorseful and of a relatively young age at the time of the offence. The learned district judge in that case accordingly decided that “a short and sharp custodial sentence would suffice” (at \[33\]).

96     By contrast, the accused in the present case is a repeat offender. His previous conviction under s 353 revealed much the same circumstances as the present case. In his conviction in 2016, the accused had gotten into a fight near Clarke Quay with the passenger of a motor vehicle. When the police arrived and tried to arrest the accused, he punched the police officer on his left cheek. To (literally) add insult to injury, the accused later shouted abusive words at the same police officer in the police car, in language peppered with expletives and racist epithets. From the point of view of specific deterrence, it was painfully evident that the accused had not learnt his lesson from his earlier conviction. I needed little persuasion that a significant uplift was in order.

97     As pointed out earlier, the sentencing precedents reveal that first-time offenders who plead guilty are generally awarded six weeks’ imprisonment for the s 353 charge. I noted that as the accused had claimed trial, he would not be able to avail of the discount for an early plea of guilt. On that basis, he would have deserved eight weeks’ imprisonment. A further uplift should also be added in view of this being a repeat offence. However, I considered the prosecution’s request for 12 weeks’ imprisonment in total to be somewhat excessive and disproportionate to the actual wrongdoing, as it doubled what I viewed to be the starting point for the offence as applicable under the present circumstances. I was of the view that an uplift to nine weeks would be sufficient to send a strong deterrent message to the accused against repeating such conduct, and to defend police officers against those who would be inclined to abuse them in their line of duty.

98     As regards the offence under s 20 of the MOA, I note that both the prosecution and defence were in agreement that a fine would be sufficient. I viewed that a fine of $1,000 (in default of which the accused would serve one weeks’ imprisonment) would be appropriate under the circumstances. I also granted an immediate stay of execution and released the bail accused on bail of $15,000 pending appeal.

99     It remains for me to thank both the prosecution and defence for their detailed arguments in the cause of their respective principals. I stand in debt to their most able assistance.
