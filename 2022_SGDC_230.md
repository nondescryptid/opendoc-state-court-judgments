\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9168/2022/01.\]

29 September 2022

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused Mr Teo Kheng Leng, a 58 years-old male Singapore citizen, faced one charge under s 15 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed)(“RTA”) and one charge under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed)(“MVA”). The two charges are set out below:

1st Charge

> are charged that you, on 16 January 2021 at about 11:40 a.m. along Upper Thomson Road, did use a motorcar no. SKQ 2491H for which a motor vehicle licence issued under Part 1 of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 was not in force (expired on 13 November 2020) and you have thereby committed an offence under section 15 of the Road Traffic Act and punishable under section 15(a) of the said act.

2nd Charge

> are charged that you, on 16 January 2021 at about 11:40 a.m. along Upper Thomson Road, did use a motorcar no. SKQ 2491H without insurance coverage when there was not in force in relation to the use of the said vehicle such a policy of insurance in respect of third party risks as complies with the requirement of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act, Chapter 189 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 3(1) and punishable under Section 3(2) of the said Act.

2       On 29 August 2022, he pleaded guilty to both these charges and admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification. After carefully considering the accused’s plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and its reply, I sentenced the accused as follows:

> (a)     a fine of $500 in default two days’ imprisonment for the charge under s 15 of the RTA and

> (b)     a fine of $600 in default three days’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months with effect from date of conviction for the charge under s 3(1) of the MVA.

His total fine was $1,100 in default 5 days and a disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months with effect from date of conviction _ie_ from 29 August 2022. He had paid the fines in full on 29 August 2022.

3       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against the order of disqualification on 6 September 2022.

4       On 14 September 2022, pursuant to the Defence’s application I ordered a stay of the disqualification order. The Prosecution has no objections to the Defence’s application.

5       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

6       The complainant is Aidil Bin Ramlan, an officer attached to the Enforcement Division, Land Transport Authority (“LTA”).

7       On 16 January 2021 at about 11.40am along Upper Thomson Road, the complainant stopped the vehicle bearing registration number SKQ2491H (“vehicle”) for an inspection. The complainant found that the vehicle did not have a valid vehicle licence (“road tax”) and insurance coverage in force. The complainant then reported the matter to LTA Investigations Division.

8       The registered owner of the vehicle is one Express Tools Pte Ltd (“company”) (Business Registration Number: 199700494E) since 5 December 2017. The defendant was the driver of the vehicle on the offence date and time. He is also the director of the company.

9       The validity period of the vehicle licence for the vehicle was only for the period from 14 May 2020 to 13 November 2020. Therefore, there was no valid vehicle licence in force when it was used on 16 January 2021 by the defendant.

10     The policy of insurance for the vehicle was with China Taiping Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“insurance company”) for the period of 24 November 2019 to 23 November 2020. As such, there was no such policy of insurance or such security in respect of third-party risks that complied with the requirement of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act, Chapter 189 (the “MVA”) when the vehicle was used by the defendant on the date and time of offence.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

11     The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 15 of the RTA is a fine not exceeding $2,000.

12     The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (“MVA”) is fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. S 3(3) of the MVA provides that a person convicted of an offence under this section shall be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the RTA for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

## Antecedents

13     The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

14     The Prosecution sought a fine of between $500 for the charge under s 15 of the RTA and a fine of $600 as well as the mandatory 12 months’ disqualification order for all classes of vehicles for the offences under s 3(1) MVA.

## Mitigation

15     In his written plea in mitigation, the Defence submitted that the vehicle that the accused was driving was a company vehicle. All the road tax and insurance renewal were carried out by the company’s agent and staff who would be reminded by LTA reminders on when the company was to renew them. In addition, it was orally submitted that the accused had bought a second-hand car and the agent had done everything for him including the transfer.

16     It was the Defence’s position that the company’s ‘admin’ clerk was supposed to have received the reminders to renew the road tax and the insurance policy when they were due but she had not received any reminders and had also forgotten about it. According to the Defence, the agent would usually email out the renewal notice but for this case had omitted to do so. Furthermore, the reminder SMS messages for the renewal of road tax and insurance were sent to the wrong mobile number and not the mobile number of the accused but the number of the agent who had sold the vehicle to the company.

17     It was the Defence’s position that this was clear evidence that the accused had not received the SMS messages on the renewal of the road tax and insurance and he was unaware until he received the notice to attend court. Further on 23 October 2022, there was a fire at the accused’s office and both the accused and his staff were busy trying to renovate and refurbish his office. Hence, the issue of the renewal of the road tax and insurance had not crossed anybody’s mind. The accused has since renewed the road tax as well as the insurance of the vehicle and updated the contact particulars in the LTA system.

18     It was submitted by the Defence that these were sufficient reasons not to order any disqualification of the accused’s driving licence. If the court was inclined to order a disqualification order, it was further submitted that a disqualification order of less than 12 months should be imposed.

## Prosecution’s Reply

19     In response to the plea in mitigation, it was submitted that it is not the duty of the agent to inform and remind vehicle owners that the road tax and insurance are due. It was the Prosecution’s position that the special reasons must relate to the offence and the reasons provided were not offence-specific.

## My decision on sentence

### S 15 RTA

20     The usual sentence imposed for a first offender for an offence under s 15 of the RTA is a fine of between $500 to $700.

### S 3(1) of the MVA

21     The usual sentence for a first offender for an offence under s 3(1) of the MVA is a fine ranging from $600 to $800 and the mandatory disqualification for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order. In the present case, it was the Defence’s position that there were ‘sufficient reasons’ not to order any disqualification of the accused’s driving licence.

22     The meaning of “special reasons” was considered by the High Court in the cases of _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span> and _Prathib s/o M Balan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1066</span>. The High Court held that the phrase “special reasons” has a narrow meaning. Only reasons connected to the offence and not reasons related to the offender are to be considered.

23     In the present case, I noted that the registered owner of the vehicle is Express Tools Pte Ltd since 5 December 2017. The accused is not only the director of the said company but was the driver of the vehicle at the material time. As a director of the company as well as the driver of the vehicle, it is his responsibility to ensure that the correct particulars are maintained in the register of vehicles including the contact particulars provided to the Registrar of Vehicles pursuant to r 12 of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicle, Registration and Licensing) Rules.

24     In addition, as a user of the vehicle on any road, it was his duty to ensure that the vehicle had the requisite vehicle licence in force under s 15 of the RTA as well as the necessary motor insurance coverage under s 3(1) of the MVA. During his mitigation, the Defence had conceded that the accused was aware that the road tax must be renewed either every six months or every 12 months and insurance coverage was usually for a year. Based on the above, in my view, the accused had failed to show he had exercised reasonable diligence in ensuring this responsibility was complied with.

25     In the present case, the Defence had sought to conflate the renewal of the vehicle licence with the renewal of insurance coverage and sought to attribute the non-renewal of both to the fact that no LTA reminders for the renewal of road tax and insurance were received as the mobile number provided belonged to the agent who had sold the vehicle in 2017. The Defence had also sought to lay the blame on the company’s ‘admin clerk’ as well as the company’s agent on the basis that they had forgotten to do so or had omitted to remind the company do so.

26     It is a known fact that for the renewal of vehicle licences, the LTA sends SMS reminders in the form of a link to _One-Motoring_, which is an e-Services website maintained by the LTA. Upon accessing the site, the registered user of a vehicle would be able to view the Notice of Vehicle Licence Renewal which states that the road tax (vehicle licence) is expiring and the deadline for its renewal. Late fees are payable when a renewal is made after this deadline. As an added measure, LTA only allows the payment for a vehicle licence can only be made when there is insurance coverage for the road tax renewal period.

27     I did not accept Counsel’s argument that ‘the paperless road tax makes it extremely hard for drivers to monitor the currency of the road tax and insurance policy’. To the contrary, with the provision of such e-services, it is now much easier for to make electronic payments through the internet, mobile phone or kiosks using internet banking, credit card or debit cards. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the user of the vehicle to ensure that the vehicle licence is renewed either annually or biannually and the insurance coverage must cover the road tax renewal period.

28     Furthermore, when the reminder for the renewal of a motor insurance policy is sent by the insurance company or its agent, it is more as a form of service to a policyholder when it is not legally obliged to do so. In the present case, as a director of the company as well as the driver of the vehicle, he was responsible for ensuring that China Taiping Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd had the correct contact particulars when the car was purchased in December 2017. This would enable the insurer to contact the company including the accused as its director, on all matters relating to the insured motor vehicle including any reminders for the renewal of the insurance policy for the vehicle.

29     Accordingly, based on the facts and circumstances before me, I found that there were no special reasons present in the case for me not to make the disqualification order pursuant to s 3(3) of the MVA. There was also no basis for me to depart from the imposition of the mandatory 12 months’ disqualification alternatively sought by the Defence.

30     In the present case, the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to both proceeded charges. Taking these factors into consideration I imposed a fine of $500 in default two days**’** imprisonment in respect of the charge under s 15 of the RTA and a fine $600 in default three days’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months from the date of his conviction for the charge under s 3(1) of the MVA.
