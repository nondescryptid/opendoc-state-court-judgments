### District Judge Lim Tse Haw:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused person, Kumarasamy s/o Govindasamy (“the Accused”) claimed trial to one amended charge summarised as follows:

DAC 921644/2016

Between the 14 and 24 November 2014 at Singapore Food Industries Pte Ltd (“SFI”) located at No.234 Pandan Loop, Singapore, the Accused, whilst being employed as a servant of SFI in the capacity of a supervisor, and in such capacity being entrusted with property, _to wit_, S$29,119.04, did commit criminal breach of trust by dishonestly misappropriating the said property, which is an offence punishable under Section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved its case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused of the amended charge. I now set out below the full grounds for my decision.

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

#### (A)    Background Facts

3       It was not in dispute at the trial that at the material time of the offence, the Accused was employed by SFI as a supervisor. SFI is in the food industry and part of its business is in the delivery of pork (both fresh and frozen) to various purchasers. Drivers under the employ of SFI would undertake such delivery duties. As one of the two supervisors[^1] in charge of the food delivery section in SFI, the Accused was in charge of, _inter alia_, six drivers. The six drivers were Goh Bok San (“Bok San”)[^2], Sattimurthi a/l Muniandy (“Satti”)[^3], Suresh a/l Viran (“Suresh”)[^4], Lee Lee Siang (“Lee Siang”)[^5], Ng Boon Seng (“Boon Seng”)[^6] and Chong Fatt[^7].

4       After making their deliveries, they will hand over the cash collected, together with a copy of the invoice[^8] to either the Accused or the other supervisor, Tan Thiam Hock (“Tan”).[^9] When Tan was not around or on leave, they would hand over the same to the Accused, and vice versa. The supervisors were responsible in ensuring that the cash collected tallied with the invoice amount before depositing the cash and invoice into the company’s safe (“the Safe Box”).[^10] It was not in dispute that Tan was on leave from 14 to 21 November 2014.[^11]

#### (B)   Events leading to the Accused being investigated by SFI

5       The Finance Department of SFI would run a cash sales outstanding payment details report from their financial management system every Monday. They would sieve out all outstanding payments from cash sales and export it onto an excel spreadsheet. For the period from 14 to 24 November 2014, they noticed a shortfall of a total of $29,685.32 [^12] arising from a total of 95 invoices from the deliveries. After checking with all the relevant customers that they had paid for the pork delivered, the Finance Department decided to hold a meeting on 4 December 2014 with the transport supervisors, namely the Accused and Tan, in order to go through the outstanding cash collections as summarized in P4.

6       The Finance Manager of SFI, Ms Elaine Lim Hwee Chern (“Elaine”)[^13] testified that at the meeting on 4 December 2014, the Accused claimed that he did not have the invoices. The Finance Department then requested the Accused to search for the invoices. The next day, the senior warehouse manager of SFI, Ng Eng Boon (“Eng Boon”)[^14] handed over to her a total of 95 invoices. He informed her that these 95 invoices were handed over to the driver Suresh by the Accused. Eng Boon testified[^15] that he had actually arranged another meeting with the drivers and the Accused the next day on 5 December 2014 but the Accused did not turn up. Instead the Accused called Eng Boon on 5 December 2014 and asked him to go to Clementi Police Division to collect the invoices. Eng Boon asked the Accused to bring the invoices to the office but the Accused claimed that he was sick and hung up the phone. The Accused then called Eng Boon again later and told Eng Boon that he had already passed the invoices to Suresh. Suresh then passed a bag containing the invoices to Eng Boon. Later in the evening on the same day, the Accused called Eng Boon again and told him that the Accused’s daughter “will pay” and that he would be making a report to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”). The Accused kept saying that the drivers “played him out”. After confirming that none of the cash collected for these 95 invoices were received by SFI, Elaine decided to check with the six drivers and the supervisors on these outstanding amounts.

7       Another meeting was held on 9 December 2014. According to Elaine[^16], all the six drivers when through the invoices during the meeting and said that they collected the cash and handed the cash over to the Accused. The Accused also admitted at the meeting that he had received the cash. Elaine then told the Accused that he had to sign off on all the invoices that he had received the monies. Instead of signing, the Accused wrote the word “paid” on the invoices. When asked where the monies were, the Accused said he cannot remember where the full sum was but claimed to have lost some of them.

8       On 10 December 2014, Eng Boon filed a police report against the Accused on the missing cash.[^17] When asked about the difference in the figure in P4($29,685.32) and that in the police report ($29,785.13), Elaine explained that the difference of $99.81 was due to the fact that the police report had included the price of one item that was not delivered.[^18] Eng Boon also tendered the Accused’s work attendance record[^19], showing that the Accused had reported for work every day from 14 to 24 November 2014.

#### (C)   The Evidence of Tan and the Six Drivers

#### i.   The Evidence of Tan

9       Tan confirmed that either the Accused or he will receive the cash collections from the drivers. Tan said that if he was not around, the Accused would be the supervisor receiving the cash collections. He confirmed that he was on overseas leave from 14 to 21 November 2014 (a Friday). He was back in the office on 24 November (a Monday). Tan testified that he did not receive the cash and invoices in any of the 95 invoices as they were never in his possession.

10     During cross-examination by Mr Jayakumar, counsel for the Accused, it was put to Tan that some of the cash collections that he had received from the management of SFI after 24 November 2014 were related to the missing monies from the 95 invoices. Tan disagreed.

#### ii.   The Evidence of Satti

11     Only two invoices from Satti were involved in this matter, dated 17 and 20 November 2014 respectively.[^20] During this period, Tan was on leave and Satti said he handed the cash collections to the Accused. Satti said that during the meeting on 9 December 2014, the Accused also admitted to receiving the same. During cross-examination, it was put to Satti that he did not handover the cash to the Accused, but Satti disagreed.

#### iii.   The Evidence of Lee Siang

12     Similarly, only two invoices from Lee Siang were involved in this matter, dated 18 and 20 November 2014 respectively.[^21] Lee Siang said he handed the cash to the Accused because Tan was on leave. Lee Siang further said in cross-examination that whenever he handed the cash collections to the Accused, the Accused would count the monies. The Accused would collect any shortfall from him even if it was $1 short.[^22] This was not challenged by Mr Jayakumar during his cross-examination.

#### iv.   The Evidence of Suresh

13     Suresh had six invoices involved in this matter. Four were dated 16 November 2014 and two dated 23 November 2014.[^23] Suresh testified that as both 16 and 23 November 2014 were Sundays, he handed the cash to the Accused at the office at 9, Buroh Lane, as Tan did not work on Sundays and did not collect the cash at this office. Further, Suresh testified that before the meeting on 5 December 2014, it was the Accused who had called him up and asked him to go to a carpark at an NTUC FairPrice car park at Clementi. There, the Accused handed a big envelope over to him and told him to hand it over to Eng Boon. The Accused told him that he was not feeling well and was going home. Suresh said he did not open the envelope but handed it over to Eng Boon. It was only when Eng Boon opened the envelope that they realised there were invoices inside but without the money.[^24] In cross-examination, Mr Jayakumar put to Suresh, without much basis, that he did not do the deliveries for the invoices with the numbers ending 755 and 781 respectively. Suresh disagreed.[^25] The Defence did not challenge Suresh’s evidence that it was the Accused who had handed the invoices to him in an envelope.

#### v.   The Evidence of Boon Seng[^26]

14     Boon Seng had eight invoices[^27] involved in this matter. Five were dated from 18 to 21 November 2014 when Tan was on leave. Three were dated 22 to 23 November 2014. Boon Seng testified that he “usually” handed his cash collections to the Accused. If Accused was on his day off, he would hand the cash to Tan. If Tan was not also around, he would then hand the monies to another supervisor, Stephen.

15     In cross-examination, it was put to Boon Seng that he had used all the monies that he had collected for his invoices for his own personal purposes. Boon Seng denied this.[^28]

#### vi.   The Evidence of Bok San[^29]

16     Bok San testified that for his cash collections, he would hand them to the Accused if Tan was not around. However, if both Tan and the Accused were around, he would hand them to Tan. A total of 41 invoices from Bok San’s cash collections were involved in this matter.[^30] Out of these invoices, 25 were dated between 19 to 21 November 2014 when Tan was on leave. 16 were dated between 22 to 24 November 2014 when Tan was not on leave. Although Bok San said that all the cash collections in the 41 invoices in P2 were handed over to the Accused, he could not pin-point at anything on the invoices which showed that the Accused had acknowledged receipt of the monies from him.

17     Bok San gave evidence that during the meeting on 9 December 2014, he told the meeting that he had handed the cash collections in all the invoices in P2 to the Accused. The Accused then told the meeting that he would settle these cash collections with Bok San. It was only then that Bok San was allowed to leave the meeting. Bok San explained that his understanding then was that the Accused would repay all the cash collections on his behalf.[^31]

18     In cross-examination, Bok San said that he would usually complete his delivery duties and collection of the cash sales by 12 pm to 1 pm. For his cash collections from Monday to Saturday, he would hand the collections to the Accused at the SFI office at Pandan Loop. For Sunday and public holidays, he would hand them to the Accused at the SFI office at Jalan Buroh as the Accused had to return the empty trays to NTUC FairPrice. It was put to him by Mr Jayakumar, that the Accused would not be in the office to receive any cash from him as the Accused only returned to the office by about 5 pm-5.30 pm. Bok San disagreed. It was also put to him that for Sunday and public holiday, the cash collections would be handed over “to a staff other than the Accused” at the SFI office at Jalan Buroh. Bok San similarly disagreed. However, Bok San agreed with Mr Jayakumar that he could not say specifically _when_ he handed the cash collections to the Accused and _when_ he handed to Tan.[^32] Nevertheless, Bok San disagreed with Mr Jayakumar when it was put to him that the Accused did not tell him at the meeting that the Accused would settle all the outstanding cash collections pertaining to invoices handed in by Bok San referred to in P2.[^33]

#### vii.   The Evidence of Chong Fatt

19     A total of 36 invoices from Chong Fatt’s cash collections were initially involved in this matter.[^34] Subsequently, Chong Fatt clarified that the amount of $539.28 purportedly collected for the invoice no.12850821 was not handled by him as his name was not stated on the invoice. Also, he rarely made delivery to the location stated on that invoice (Woodlands). He further pointed out that there was an error in the amount printed in invoice no.12850142 ($374.50). He said the customer pointed out that the amount should be $347.50 (as handwritten by the customer on the invoice), namely, a difference of $27. This resulted in the Prosecution amending the amount stated in the charge from the original $ 29,685.32 to S$29,119.04.[^35]

20     Out of these 35 invoices, 32 were dated between 14 to 21 November 2014 when Tan was on leave. Only three were dated 22 November 2014 when Tan was not on leave. Chong Fatt testified that he handed all the cash collected in the 35 invoices to the Accused.

21     In cross examination, it was put to Chong Fatt that for the invoices dated 22 November 2014, he had handed the cash to Tan. Chong Fatt said that he cannot remember.

## THE DEFENCE’S CASE

#### The Accused’s Evidence

22     The Accused testified that he first started working for SFI as a delivery driver. He was promoted to be an assistant supervisor in 2007. In 2011, he was promoted to be a supervisor. On his work schedule, he said he will start making deliveries to NTUC FairPrice (“NTUC”) and some other customers at 5 a.m. daily. He would return to the office at about 10 a.m. At about 11.30 a.m., he would leave again to deliver lunch for SFI staff at the offices at 213, Pandan Loop and Buroh lane. At about 12 noon, he would make another delivery of goods and fresh pork to NTUC again. He would return to office at about 4.50 pm. He would then prepare the paperwork for delivery for the next day. He would do this until about 7.30 pm and he would leave for home. He worked seven days a week. However, on Saturdays, he would leave for home at 3.30 pm and on Sundays, at 9.30 a.m.

23     He said Tan was his superior. Tan would come into the office at about 7 a.m. and he would check the goods for delivery to the army camps. Tan would be done for the day by 9.30 a.m. He would leave for home at about 5.15 pm.

24     The Accused said he had 12 drivers under his supervision, including the six drivers who testified for the prosecution. The Accused also said that the drivers would hand over the cash they had collected from their deliveries to him if he was in the office. If he was not in the office, they would hand it over to Tan.[^36] The Accused said there was no requirement for him to acknowledge receipt of the cash when he received the same from the drivers.

25     He conceded that during the period from 14 to 21 November 2014 when Tan was on leave, he had received the cash collections from _some_ of the drivers. He mentioned drivers like “Ravi”, “Ah Lian”, “Ah Tee”[^37] and “Lim” and said that he cannot remember if there were others. He said he did not keep the monies he had collected and that he had banked them in immediately. He denied misappropriating these monies.[^38]

26     When asked by Mr Jayakumar to elaborate on what happened after Tan had gone on leave on 14 November 2014, the Accused said he told the drivers that as they could only see him in the morning, they were supposed to drop the cash collections in the cash box. He said all the drivers told him that they had done so. For the monies given to him in the morning, he would bank in the cash. However, the Accused added that sometimes when he was not around, some drivers would just “throw” the invoices with the cash into his drawer.[^39]

27     On the bag of invoices which he had handed to Suresh, the Accused said that on a Wednesday after he came back to the office after his leave on the preceding Tuesday, Tan told him that there were some invoices in a plastic bag left in one of the drawers placed at a corner of the office, an area which was accessible by everyone. The Accused then took the plastic bag and counted the invoices inside. The bag did not contain all the 95 invoices inside and the Accused told Tan he would take the invoices and check the next day. The Accused said he had pressures from work and was not feeling very well then. He visited a clinic. He then called Suresh for help and handed the invoices to him. He also called Eng Boon to tell him that he (the Accused) was not feeling well and would only go back to work the following day.[^40]

28     The Accused then claimed that during the meeting with the personnel from the Finance Department, he was shown invoices which were not among the invoices in the bag that he had handed over to Suresh. However, he cannot remember how many.[^41] He said he immediately pointed this out to Tan at the meeting. He claimed he told the meeting that he did not know what had happened to the missing monies. The Accused said he was told that he would be responsible for all the monies collected for the invoices and he must sign on them. The Accused said he refused to sign as there were some invoices which were without any cash when he received them. Elaine then told him that only if he signed then “something can be done about it”. So he signed as “there was nothing that could be done about it”.[^42] The Accused conceded that he had signed “paid” on all the invoices. He said he did this as he was left all alone because Tan, who knew “the entire story”, had refused to help him despite having told the Accused that he would help him.[^43]

#### (i)   Statement in D2

29     Mr Jayakumar then admitted a statement made by the Accused on 10 December 2014 in the presence of some witnesses from SFI as part of the defence’s exhibit.[^44] In the statement, the Accused explained that from the invoices he had received from the drivers, some came with cash, some without any cash, and some drivers would only pass him the cash four or five days later. He did not tally the cash with the individual invoice. After receiving the cash, he would put it one side. If he had the time to do it, he would deposit the cash into the Safe Box. If he did not, he would leave it in the drawer or on the table.

30     He said in D2 that he was responsible to count the monies he had received from the drivers. He would tally the cash received with the invoices. Those that tallied, he would deposit them into the Safe Box. Those that did not, he would put them one side. He said he did not match the cash specifically to the invoices. He did not know if there was any “shortage” in the monies collected. When he became aware of the shortages, he put the stack of invoices, without the cash, in his lorry.[^45]

31     When asked in D2 about the shortfall of about $29,000 between the cash collection and the sales invoices collected by him, the Accused said he cannot explain the shortfall but that he had lost two or three bundles of cash, which may have amounted to more than $20,000.[^46] He did not report the loss as he had wanted to pay back the money on his own.[^47] He also said that no one else knew about the shortfall.[^48] However, when he was asked about the loss of the two or three bundles of cash in his evidence in chief, the Accused clarified that he meant that the drivers may not have deposited the cash into the Safe Box. He then said that actually Eng Boon had brought the cash and gave it to Tan. However, Tan did not hand the cash to him. He said that the cash was for the invoices and could have tallied with the amounts stated in the invoices. However, Tan did not hand the cash to him although he had asked Tan for it. He further added that on a Saturday, one Saravanan gave him some money. If this money and the $20,000 which Eng Boon had handed over to Tan were to be added up, it would come up to the missing $29,000.[^49]

#### (ii)   Statement in D3

32     Mr Jayakumar also tendered a statement made by the Accused to the police on 9 March 2015[^50] as part of the defence’s case. In this statement, the Accused stated that he was supposed to tally the cash collected with the amount stated in the invoice. If they did not tally, he had to report to the management. If they tallied, he would scan the invoices, bundle the cash with the invoices in a plastic bag and deposit the bag into the Safe Box.[^51]

33     When asked about the police report in P6 made against him by Eng Boon on behalf of SFI on the missing cash, the Accused said that since the beginning of November 2014, he noticed that the cash collected by him from the drivers did not tally with the invoices. At that time, he assumed that some of the drivers had yet to pass him the cash. Thinking that the cash would be handed over to him later, he said he would then submit these invoices with the cash which tallied. Those that did not tally, he would just keep the invoices one side. However, as time went by, the shortfall became bigger and bigger.

34     When he was called up by Eng Boon in early December 2014 and questioned about the shortfall, the Accused said he told Eng Boon to give him some time to check. However, the following day, he told Eng Boon that he would go to the police station to hand over the invoices to the police. He also called up his human resource department and told them that some cash was missing. He also called up Suresh and told him that he (the Accused) would pass him some invoices to be handed over to Eng Boon.

35     At the meeting with the personnel from the Finance Department and the drivers, the Accused said that since all the drivers said that they had passed the cash relating to the invoices to him, he had “no choice to answer and just kept quite” (_sic)._ Elaine then told him to sign on all the invoices after she had written the word “paid” on the invoices. This was for him to acknowledge that the cash was paid to him. He just followed her instructions and signed on all the invoices._[^52]_

36     On why he did not report the shortfall in cash to the management when he discovered it in early November 2014, the Accused repeated his earlier statement that he thought the cash would be handed to him later, and he did not want to make it a “big matter.” He said he really thought he could resolve the issue by using the cash “collected at a later time to pay for the earlier invoices”.[^53]

37     When asked how he had lost the two or three bundles of cash, the Accused said sometimes he just “put the bundle of cash on the open table”. He admitted that it was his mistake to do so.[^54] When shown all the 95 invoices, the Accused confirmed that these were the invoices which he had handed over to SFI without the cash collected.[^55] The Accused, however, denied using the monies for his own purposes but could not explain why the shortfall was so much.[^56]

#### (iii)   Statement in D4

38     Mr Jayakumar further tendered the cautioned statement made by the Accused to the police under section 23(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Revised Edition 2012)(“CPC”) dated 31May 2016[^57] as part of the defence’s case. When informed by the police that he was being charged with an offence of criminal breach of trust as servant of cash amounting to $29,685.32 that was entrusted to him by SFI, the Accused had this to say:

_“I did not do it. Yong Tee[^58] have passed the money to the manager, Eng Boon.”_

39     In the Accused’s evidence in chief, Mr Jayakumar then spent a substantial amount of time eliciting evidence from the Accused, in remarkable details, on why payments were _not collected_ by the drivers for some[^59] of the 95 invoices in P3 during the period from 14 to 24 November 2014. However, no evidence was led from the Accused to explain why different versions were given by him in the above statements to account for the missing cash.

40     In cross-examination, the Accused generally took the position that he cannot remember many details when questions on the same were asked by the learned deputy public prosecutor (DPP), these included details in his own statements in D2 and D3 which were admitted into evidence as the Defence’s exhibits by Mr Jayakumar.[^60]

41     When asked about his cautioned statement in D4 wherein he had said that “Yong Tee” (or Boon Seng) had passed to the money to Eng Boon, the Accused added the dramatic detail that the money was “snatched” by Eng Boon from Boon Seng and handed over to Tan. He said that was why he had asked the police for help.[^61]

42     The Defence also called a former driver of SFI, one Saravanan s/o Jairam (“Saravanan”) as a defence witness[^62]. However, the evidence given by him was in relation to invoices which were passed to Tan by one “Ah Kao”, who went with Saravanan to make deliveries. According to Saravanan, these invoices had got nothing to do with the 94 invoices in P5. No evidence was led from Saravanan on whether he was the same “Saravanan” who had given the Accused some money as stated in \[31\] above.

## MY DECISION

#### The Issues to be Decided

43     It was not in dispute at the trial that at the material time of the offence, the Accused was employed by SFI as a supervisor. It was also not in dispute that one of the duties that he had in his capacity as a supervisor was to receive the cash payments collected by the drivers after delivery, together with the invoices (“the collections”). Hence, the two main issues that this court had to decide at the close of the case was whether:

i.     The Accused did receive, by way of entrustment, the cash totalling $29,119.04 from 14 to 24 November 2014 in his capacity as a supervisor from the six drivers who had testified at this trial; and

ii.     If he did, he had dishonestly misappropriated the cash.

#### (i)   Did the Accused Receive the Cash?

44     The Prosecution had established at the trial that the other supervisor who would also have had the duty to receive such collections, Tan, was on leave from 14 to 21 November 2014, leaving the Accused as the only other supervisor who was around to receive such collections from 14 to 21 November. The Accused himself had admitted at the trial, that in Tan’s absence, he was the supervisor who would have received the collections from the drivers.[^63]

45     While I have no reason to doubt the credibility of the six drivers, I note that they could only _generally_ claim, based on their memory, that they had handed the collections to the Accused, without being able to point to anything on the invoices which can support their claim. This is especially so for the period from 22 to 24 November 2014 when Tan was not on leave (hence both the Accused and Tan were in the office to receive the collections from the drivers). Further, the supervisors were not required to acknowledge on the invoices the receipt of the cash. Hence, on the drivers’ evidence alone that they had handed the collections to the Accused for the period from 14 to 24 November 2014, there would be insufficient evidence to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that this was indeed the case, especially for the period from 22 to 24 November 2014 when Tan was not on leave. However, in my judgment, this weakness in the Prosecution’s case, which resulted from the inadequacy in SFI’s accountability procedure in the receipt of monies, was sufficiently compensated by the following facts:

(a)     During the 9 December 2014 meeting, when the six drivers, Tan and the Accused were confronted with the missing cash in the 94 invoices, the Accused had admitted that he had received the cash in the 94 invoices and _acknowledge_d the receipt by writing the word “_Paid_” on the 94 invoices. In my view, if the Accused had not received the invoices and the cash, there was no reason for him to have acknowledged the same by writing the word “_Paid_” on all 94 invoices. I did not accept his explanation that he only signed on the invoices because, _inter alia_, Elaine had told him that only if he had signed on the invoices then “something can be done about it”, as highlighted in \[28\] above. This is because no further explanation was given by the Accused as to what this “something” was, which had convinced him to sign on the invoices despite not having received the collections;

(b)     The above conclusion was further strengthened by the fact that it was the Accused who had handed the bag containing the 94 invoices to Suresh to be handed over to Eng Boon. If he did not receive the collections from the drivers in the first place, how did he come to have possession of the 94 invoices subsequently? I also did not accept the Accused’s explanation in his evidence in chief on how he came to have possession of the 94 invoices as summarized in \[27\] above. This is because this version of the events was never raised in any of his statements tendered as part of the Defence’s case. This was also not put to Tan when Tan was on the witness stand. This clearly showed that this version was an afterthought by the Accused.

46     Having considered the Accused’s evidence carefully in totality, I did not find him to be a credible witness. I will further elaborate on my finding in the later part of this judgment.

47     Hence, I was satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the Accused did receive, by way of entrustment, the cash accompanying the 94 invoices from the six drivers in his capacity as a supervisor of SFI for the reasons stated in \[44\] to \[46\] above.

#### (ii)   Did the Accused Dishonestly Misappropriate the Cash?

48     The Defence’s case on what had happened to the case was, to put it mildly, confusing.

49     Mr Jayakumar had introduced, as _part of the Defence’s case_, various statements made by the Accused giving _contradicting explanations_ on what had happened to the cash he had collected from the drivers:

i.     In his statement made to SFI in D2, he said that he had lost “_2 or 3 bundles of cash. It may have amounted to over $20,000_”[^64];

ii.     In his statement to the police in D3, he explained that since the beginning of November 2014, he noticed that the cash collected by him from the drivers did not tally with the figures in the invoices. So he thought that some of the drivers did not pass the cash to him. He said he thought that the money will come “sooner or later”. So he just submitted the invoices where the cash collected did tally with the amount stated therein and kept those where it did not. However, the number of invoices not submitted just grew bigger and bigger, until he was confronted by the management on the shortfall.[^65];

iii.     In his cautioned statement in D4, he said that “_Yong Tee[^66] have passed the money to the manager, Eng Boon”._

50     In his evidence in chief, yet more contradicting versions were given. Essentially, they were as follows:

i.     For 45 out of the 94 invoices, no cash was collected by the drivers when they delivered the goods, for various reasons which were given by the Accused at the trial in remarkable details.[^67] Quite apart from the fact one wondered how the Accused was able to remember, some four to five years after the events, the details of the deliveries and the alleged non-payment for the invoices (when he was not even the driver who had delivered the goods), these positions were never put to the drivers when they were being cross-examined by Mr Jayakumar on the witness stand. The rule in _Brown v Dunn_ would have precluded the Defence from putting forth such a defence;

ii.     Then he said that whatever cash he had received from the drivers, he would have banked in the cash immediately. He also claimed that some drivers would just “throw” the invoices into his drawer whenever he was not around.[^68] This contradicted his statement in D2 where he had stated that he had lost “two or three bundles of cash” when he was asked to account for the missing cash by SFI’s Finance Department. This also contradicted his statement to the police in D3 where he had stated that he was keeping the invoices where the cash collected did not tally with amount stated in the invoices;

iii.     On the bag of invoices which he had handed to Suresh, the Accused alleged, for the _first time_, that it was Tan who had told him that there were some invoices in a plastic bag left in one of the drawers placed at a corner of the office which was accessible by everyone. He then took the plastic bag and counted the invoices inside. It _did not_ contain _all_ 95 invoices inside and the Accused told Tan that he would take the invoices back and check the next day. [^69] In other words, these invoices _were not handed to him by the drivers_ but were left in the drawer by the drivers. Similarly, this position was not put to Tan and the drivers by Mr Jayakumar when they were being cross-examined. Hence, the rule in _Brown v Dunn_ would have similarly precluded the Defence from putting forth such a case. As a result, the Accused had _no other explanation_ on how he came to be in possession of the 94 invoice other than because _he had received the same_ from the drivers. In my judgement, his oral evidence in court was merely a belated attempt by the Accused, while on the witness stand, to come up with an explanation on why he had all the 94 invoices when he did not receive the same from the drivers;

iv.     Finally, he made the preposterous allegation in cross-examination that the missing money was “snatched” by Eng Boon from Boon Seng and handed over to Tan.[^70]. Again, this position was not put to the witnesses by Mr Jayakumar when they were being cross-examined. Quite apart from the fact that the rule in _Brown v Dunn_ would have precluded the Defence from putting forth such a case, in my judgment, this belated assertion was so absurd that it is devoid of any credibility: if this was indeed the case, why the Accused did not mention this very important fact in any of his earlier statements to the police or SFI? The simple answer to this question is that it was a mere afterthought by the Accused to try to exculpate himself after having misappropriated the cash.

51     In fact, the above contradicting versions given by the Accused gave rise to more questions than answers. For example, if, as he had claimed in \[49\](i) above, that he had lost “_2 or 3 bundles of cash”_ (amounting to over $20,000), why he did not report this to the management of SFI as soon as possible? He did not lose just $20 or $30, in which case he may be able to reimburse SFI from his own pocket. Surely he was not thinking of reimbursing SFI the sum of more than $20,000?

52     On the version that he gave to the police in D3 as summarized in \[49\](ii) above, that he had noticed the cash collected by him from the drivers did not tally with the figures in the invoices, the question arose then would be why he did not confront the drivers on the reason(s) for the shortfall in the cash collected when compared to the amount stated in the invoices? Surely it would be a serious concern to him whenever there was such a discrepancy and that it was something he would want to look into or at least inform the management of SFI of such discrepancies? This is especially so as he was described by Lee Siang (as stated in \[12\] above) as someone who “would collect any shortfall … even if it was $1 short”. This showed that the Accused was quite a meticulous supervisor.

53     From the above various contradicting versions given by the Accused in his defence and the lack of explanations on the contradictions, these led me to one conclusion and one conclusion only: that the Accused was not a credible witness and had lied in his evidence and various statements out of realisation of guilt. Hence I had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that the Accused had dishonestly misappropriated the sum of $29,119.04 for his own use, which was why he was not able to come up with a consistent and credible explanation to account for the cash that he had collected from the six drivers.

54     In the circumstances, I found that the Prosecution had proven its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the Accused guilty and convicted him accordingly.

## ANTECEDENT

55     Apart from some traffic-related offences, the Accused did not have any other antecedent.

## SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE BY THE PROSECUTION

56     The Prosecution submitted for a custodial sentence of between 15 to 18 months to be imposed on the Accused. In support of its submissions, the Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents for the offence under section 408 of the Penal Code (“the Precedents”).

57     In particular, the Prosecution relied on the case of _Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam_ \[2017\] 4 SLR 1349[^71] to support its submissions. The brief facts of the case are follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="67.46%"> <col width="32.54%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Case &amp; Brief Facts</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The offender was employed as a customer service officer by the company.

A lower sentence was warranted due to the offender’s motivation for the offence.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

58     The Prosecution pointed out that in the Accused’s case, he was convicted after a full trial. No restitution was made and the Accused had impugned the integrity of prosecution’s witnesses. There was also a lack of any extenuating circumstances as to why the Accused had misappropriated the monies. The Accused’s conduct showed a complete lack of remorse. Hence, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence in the range of 15-18 months’ imprisonment.[^72]

## MITIGATION AND SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE BY THE DEFENCE

59     In mitigation, Mr Jayakumar pointed out that the Accused did not have any relevant criminal antecedent apart from the traffic antecedents. He added that had the Accused wanted to misappropriate the monies, he would have had a lot of opportunities to do so, being a long time employee of SFI. [^73] I thought this was rather unhelpful for the purposes of the Accused’s mitigation.

60     Mr Jayakumar did not make any submission on sentence.

## THE SENTENCE

61     In sentencing the Accused in the present case, apart from the case of _Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam_ as highlighted in \[57\] above, I have also considered the facts and sentences imposed in the following two cases cited in the Precedents in respect of which appeals were made to the High Court:

62     The High Court in _Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam_ held that the usual sentence for an offender who has pleaded guilty to a section 408 charge involving a sum of around **$30,000** would be in the region of **10 months’ imprisonment**, without any mitigating circumstances as to the reason for the commission of the offence.

63     Chan Sek Keong J in _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP_[^77] also held that,

_“(i)n an offence like criminal breach of trust, it was a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court.”_

64     In _Soong Hee Sin_, which was a prosecution under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code where the maximum imprisonment for section 408 offence was only seven years, as opposed to the present 15 years, the offender, who had pleaded guilty _and_ made a not insubstantial restitution of $5000, was sentenced to **9 months’ imprisonment** for misappropriating **$10,485.22**. This sum was slightly more than one-third of the sum misappropriated by the Accused in the present case[^78], who also did not make any restitution. Further, as the Accused in the present case was convicted after a full trial, unlike the offender in _Soong Hee Sin_ who had pleaded guilty, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that he would not be entitled to the usual sentencing discount of about one-third of the actual sentence. Hence, based on the sentence imposed in _Soong Hee Sin_, the appropriate sentence for the Accused would have been in the region of 25 months’ imprisonment. [^79]

65     In addition, the sum misappropriated by the Accused, **$29,119.04**, was close to that in _Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam._ However, he did not have any mitigating circumstances as to the reason for the commission of the offence, unlike the offender in _Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam_. Hence, the appropriate sentence for the Accused based on the sentence imposed in _Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam_ would be in the region of 15 months’ imprisonment.

66     In _Sukumaran s/o Thyagarajan_, the amount misappropriated ($29,489.40) was very close to that in the present case. The offender was also convicted after a full trial, like the Accused. However, I noted that he only benefited $537.30 from his offence. In the absence of any explanation from the Accused on what he did with the monies which he had misappropriated in the present case, I can only infer that he had benefitted from the full extent of the amount that he had misappropriated. Hence, in my judgment, a necessary uplift from the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment received by the offender in _Sukumaran s/o Thyagarajan_ would be appropriate.

67     In the circumstances, having considered the above sentencing precedents, I sentenced the Accused to **15 months’ imprisonment.** Further, as the Accused had not made any restitution, it was necessary to disgorge the illegal benefits that he had obtained as a result of his crime. Hence I deemed it fit to also impose a **fine of $29,000** on the Accused, in default two months’ imprisonment.

68     Being dissatisfied with the above judgement, the Accused has appealed against both conviction and sentence. He is currently out on bail pending this appeal. Both the sentences of imprisonment and fine have been stayed pending this appeal.
