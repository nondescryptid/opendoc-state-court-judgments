### Principal District Judge Victor Yeo Khee Eng:

## Introduction

The Accused, Shaun Koh Kim Guan, 23 years old, pleaded guilty to two charges comprising of one charge of voluntarily causing hurt by means of a dangerous weapon by stabbing the victim with a foldable knife, an offence punishable under s 324 of the Penal Code (PC) (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008); and one charge of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place, to wit, a knife, without lawful authority or lawful purpose under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosives Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (CESOWA) (Cap 65, Rev Ed 2013).

2       Upon his conviction, the Accused admitted to and consented to another charge of voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon to another victim under section s 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       The Accused was sentenced to 6 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment for the s 324 PC charge and 6 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the s 6(1) CESOWA charge. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively, making a total sentence of **12 months and 4 weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 22 March 2021 and 6 strokes of the cane**. The Accused being dissatisfied filed an appeal against his sentence. He is currently serving sentence.

4       These are the grounds for the sentences imposed.

## The Charges

5       The proceeded charges read as follows:

>      **DAC-902395-2020 (2nd Charge)**

>     are charged that you, on 25 July 2019 at or about 4:30 a.m., at Kramat Lane, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Jacob Eugene Lloyd (‘the victim’) by means of an instrument for stabbing, to wit, by stabbing the victim with a foldable knife, which comprises a 4cm long blade and 5.5 cm long handle, causing the victim to suffer 3 superficial cuts over the left side of his abdomen, 2 superficial lacerations measuring 4cm each over his mid-back and a superficial cut over his right ring finger, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 324 of Penal Code, Chapter 224;

>      **DAC-904421-2021 (3rd Charge)**

## Statement of Facts

6       The Statement of Facts (SOF) which the Accused admitted without qualification, are as follows:

> 1    The Accused is Shaun Koh Kim Guan (“Shaun”), Male, Singapore Citizen, 23 years old, NRIC: XXX (D.O.B.: 10 July 1998).

>      **FACTS LEADING TO THE 2nd CHARGE (DAC-902395-2020)**

>      Parties

> 2    The co-Accused persons are:

>> a.    Jacob Eugene Lloyd (“Jacob”), a 32-year-old male Singaporean; and

>> b.    Toh Wee Fong (“Toh”), Male, Singapore Citizen, 33 years old.

> 3    Jacob and Toh have been dealt with separately.

>      First Information Report

> 4    On 25 July 2019 at about 4.31am, the police received a ‘999’ call, informing, “I saw 1-2 guys quarrelling holding knife. They want to fight”. The incident location was given as 100 Orchard Road, Concorde Hotel, Singapore 238840.

>      Background facts

> 5    At the material time, the Accused Shaun was released from prison on a Reformative Training early release programme on 3 July 2019.

>      The offence

> 6    On 25 July 2019 at about 3am, Toh and Jacob were drinking with three other friends inside Club Peaches, located at 100 Orchard Road, Singapore. Shaun arrived at Club Peaches with one of his friends, and sat at the neighbouring table to Toh and Jacob.

> 7    Subsequently, Shaun got into a dispute with Toh over a staring incident. Both caused a commotion by shouting and challenging each other to a fight inside the club. Bouncers immediately escorted Shaun, Toh, Jacob, and their friends out of Club Peaches, to Kramat Lane.

> 8    While along Kramat Lane, at or about 4.28am, Shaun continued to argue with Toh and Jacob. Toh and Jacob fought with Shaun by exchanging punches for approximately one minute. Shaun then pulled out a black foldable knife with blade measuring 4cm from his pants. When Toh and Jacob charged towards Shaun, Shaun thrust his knife towards Toh and Jacob multiple times with the intention of causing hurt to them, and thereby stabbed Toh and Jacob, before running away.

> 9    Bouncers from Club Peaches and the neighbouring Club One Min chased after Shaun, while Shaun waved his knife towards the group of bouncers. The bouncers subsequently managed to pin him to the ground. The bouncers then called the Police.

> 10    Once the Police arrived, Shaun was arrested and the said knife was seized as a case exhibit. A photo of the said knife is annexed at Annex A. Shaun had brought this knife out with him while he went to drink alcohol as he was feeling unhappy, and thought something might happen as it was his first time going clubbing since he was released from prison.

> 11    Shaun, Toh, and Jacob were conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) on the same day.

>      Injuries

> 12    According to a medical report dated 2 September 2019 prepared by Dr Joyce Tie \[Annex B\], the following injuries were noted on Toh:

>> a.    an approximately 3cm transverse laceration over the ulnar border of the left hand; and

>> b.    contusion on dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve.

> 13    Toh was discharged the same day and given medical leave for 15 days (from 25 July 2019 to 8 August 2019, inclusive). His laceration required suturing.

> 14    According to a medical report dated 7 August 2019 prepared by Dr Lim Wei Kian \[Annex C\], the following injuries were noted on Jacob:

>> a.    three superficial cuts over the left side of the abdomen;

>> b.    two superficial lacerations measuring 4cm each over the mid-back; and

>> c.    a superficial cut over the right ring finger.

> 15    Jacob left the Emergency Department before his review to assess if he was medically fit for discharge.

> 16    According to a medical report dated 8 August 2019 prepared by Dr Sherryl Mercado De Sagun \[Annex D\], the following injuries were noted on Shaun:

>> a.    shoe print over right side of the face;

>> b.    swelling and abrasion over right side of the head;

>> c.    tenderness over the back of the head;

>> d.    swelling of both eyes;

>> e.    tenderness over the face and over both hands;

>> f.    laceration over the left ear; and

>> g.    tenderness over lower back area.

> 17    Shaun was given hospitalisation leave for five days (from 25 to 29 July 2019, inclusive).

>      Conclusion

> 18    By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused Shaun, did voluntarily cause hurt to Jacob by means of an instrument for stabbing, to wit, by stabbing Jacob with a foldable knife, causing Jacob to suffer 3 superficial cuts over the left side of his abdomen, 2 superficial lacerations measuring 4cm each over his mid-back and a superficial cut over his right ring finger, and he has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 324 of Penal Code, Chapter 224.

>      **FACTS RELATING TO THE 3RD CHARGE (DAC-904421-2021)**

>      Background facts

> 19    On 27 February 2020, Shaun was released from Reformative Training Centre. He was under supervision from 27 February 2020 to 27 February 2021, during which time he was required to abide by certain requirements, including a requirement of not breaking the law.

>      First information report

> 20    On 20 September 2020, at about 10.53pm, one Mr Ong made a 999 call stating, “there is a group of people who are about to fight.” The incident location given was Blk 800 Yishun Ring Road, Carpark, Singapore.

> 21    Shortly after, at about 11.10pm the same day, another 999 call was made by a different caller stating “I PICKED UP A GUY AT 806 YISHUN, HE’S BLEEDING. HE JUST TOLD SOMEONE TO PICK UP HIS KNIFE. I LEFT. HE’S IN JEANS, GREY SHIRT, LONG SLEEVE. HE RAN OFF TO THE MIDDLE AREA.” The incident location given was Blk 806 Yishun Ring Road, Singapore 760806.

>      The offence

> 22    On 20 September 2020, at or about 11pm, Shaun was captured on POLCAM footage carrying a knife at the void deck of Blk 806 Yishun Ring Road, Singapore, which is a public place. Police investigations reveal that he left a trail of blood at the said location.

> 23    He was subsequently heard instructing someone over the phone to throw the knife away. The said knife was not recovered.

> 24    Shaun was carrying the said knife without lawful authority or lawful purpose. By virtue of the foregoing, he has committed an offence punishable under Section 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosives Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 2013 Rev Ed).

7       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification and accordingly, he was convicted of the two proceeded charges. He further admitted to and consented to have one charge under s 324 PC to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. This charge involved the victim Toh.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

9       The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of **at least 14 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane**.

### 2nd Charge under s 324 Penal Code

10     In relation to the 2nd charge under s 324 PC, applying the sentence framework laid out in _Ng Soon Kim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span> at \[13\]-\[17\] (“**_Ng Soon Kim_**”), the Prosecution submitted that the present case would fall under Band 1 given that the harm caused was low eventually. The indicative sentencing range under the first step is a fine or a short custodial term.

11     The second step is to apply a suitable uplift based on the dangerous means used. In this case, the Accused had used a knife with a blade measuring 4cm long, an instrument for stabbing. The prosecution submitted that a substantial uplift to four (4) to five (5) months’ imprisonment is warranted.

12     The third step is to calibrate the sentencing position on account of other considerations. In this case, there is a TIC charge for the same offence in relation to another victim (Toh), whose injuries required suturing as a result of the Accused’s actions. The Accused is traced for an offence of Affray and he committed the offences while on release on supervision from Reformative Training Centre (“**RTC**”).

13     In light of the instrument used and the aggravating factors, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least seven (7) months’ imprisonment for this charge would be appropriate.

### 3rd Charge under 6(1) CESOWA

14     In relation to the 3rd Charge under s 6 of the CESOWA, the Prosecution submitted that according to the Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (3rd Ed) at page 424, “Generally, the cases indicate that the ‘entry point’ sentence is for a sentence of at least six (6) months’ imprisonment and the mandatory six (6) strokes of the cane.”

15     In the present case, the Accused committed the offence while released on supervision from RTC and an uplift to at least seven (7) months’ imprisonment and six (6) strokes of the cane is thus warranted.

### Global sentence

16     Applying the principles in _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“**_Raveen Balakrishnan_**”) the Prosecution urged the Court to run the sentences consecutively given that they arose out of separate transactions.

17     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the global sentence sought, i.e. **at least 14 months’ imprisonment and six (6) strokes of the cane** would be appropriate as it accurately reflects the Accused’s overall criminality. It is also not crushing considering that the Accused was previously sentenced to RTC and clearly has not learnt his lesson.

## Mitigation Plea

18     In the mitigation plea, the learned Defence Counsel urged the court to impose a global sentence of **not more than 11 months, (two) 2 weeks and (three) 3 days imprisonment and six (6) strokes of the cane**.

19     The learned Counsel highlighted the Accused’s background, and that he is remorseful and is eager to make amends and start his life afresh. He has reached out to the two victims of the s 324 PC charges through mutual friends and apologized to them and offered to compensate them. Both of them have accepted the Accused’s apology and have forgiven him. He plans to continue his higher education. His family and childhood friend remained supportive of him, and his former employer is willing to offer him a job after the Accused is released.

### 2nd Charge under s 324 Penal Code

20     In relation to the 2nd charge under s 324 PC, applying the three-step approach articulated in _Ng Soon Kim_, the learned Counsel submitted that an appropriate sentence is not more than 5 months and 3 days imprisonment. The learned Counsel submitted that the present case falls on the low end of Band 1 given that the harm caused in the present case consisted mainly of superficial lacerations and there was no record of the victim on hospitalisation or medical leave. The learned counsel submitted that an appropriate starting point would be not more than 3 days.

21     The learned Counsel did not object to the Prosecution’s suggested uplift of four (4) months imprisonment for the dangerous means used.

22     Given the mitigating factors present, namely, that there was an element of provocation, and that the Accused also sustained multiple injuries and was given five days of medical leave. He had acted on impulse and there was no premeditation to hurt the two victims, and the Accused had apologised to them and offered compensation and both have forgiven him, that he had pleaded guilty, the learned Counsel suggested an uplift of not more than one (1) month imprisonment.

### 3rd Charge under 6(1) CESOWA

23     In relation to the 3rd Charge under s 6 of the CESOWA, the learned Counsel agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that an uplift may be appropriate to take into account that the offence was committed while the Accused was under RTC supervision. However, the learned Counsel submitted that it be calibrated to not more than six (6) months and two (2) weeks’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane in view of his timely plea of guilt.

### Global sentence

24     The learned Defence Counsel accepted that it would be appropriate to run the two sentences consecutively given that the two offences were unrelated events.

25     Taking one ‘last look’, and applying the totality principle, and that the global sentence should not be “crushing and out of proportion to the offender’s past record and future prospects”, the learned Counsel urged the Court to consider that the Accused is still relatively young and is still in his formative years of his higher education and career, where a longer prison sentence may have a more deleterious impact on his lift.

26     Thus, the learned Counsel submitted that a global sentence of **not more than 11 months, 2 weeks and 3 days’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane** would be appropriate in the present case.

## Sentencing Considerations

### 2nd Charge under s 324 Penal Code

27     I begin with the sentence for the 2nd charge under s 324 of the PC. Both the Prosecution and Defence agreed that applying the 3-step approach laid down in _Ng Soon Kim_, which applied the sentencing framework of _Low Song Chye_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> for a s 323 PC offence, the harm caused would fall within Band 1, for which the indicative sentencing range would be fines or short custodial term of up to four (4) weeks.

28     The facts of the case revealed that the initial dispute started over a staring incident inside the club. When the Accused, the two victims and their friends were escorted out of the club by the club bouncers, the argument between the Accused and the two victims escalated into a fight. They traded punches in public for approximately one minute when the Accused pulled out the foldable knife and stabbed both of them multiple times before running away. The victim Jacob suffered multiple lacerations over his abdomen and mid-back and superficial cut over his right ring finger. The victim Toh suffered laceration over the ulnar border of the left hand which required suturing and he was given medical leave for 15 days.

29     I note that the victim Jacob left the Emergency Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital before his review to assess if he was medically fit for discharge. As such, I hesitate to accord too much weight to the learned Counsel’s submission that the victim was not hospitalised or given any medical leave for his injuries, and that the harm caused should be at the lower end of Band 1.

30     I did not think that the injuries inflicted on Jacob were any less serious than that suffered by Toh, and it was fortunate that the knife injuries inflicted were not more serious than the multiple lacerations and superficial cuts documented in the medical report. The cuts were also on the left side of abdomen and mid-back, areas which are relatively near to the vital organs. In my view, a short custodial sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment would be an appropriate indicative sentence had the charge been brought under s 323 of the PC.

31     The second step requires the court to consider a suitable uplift based on the dangerous means used to inflict the injuries. In this case, it was common ground that an uplift of at least four (4) months’ imprisonment would be appropriate considering that a knife is an instrument for stabbing or cutting, and which used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death. From the photograph, the foldable knife had a 4cm long blade with a sharp tip, and a 5.5cm long handle. As revealed in the Statement of Facts, the Accused had brought the knife out with him while he went to drink alcohol as he was feeling unhappy. He thought something might happen as it was his first time going clubbing since he was released on the RT early release programme. Regrettably, what started as a staring incident inside the club escalated into a fist fight in a public lane, and the Accused saw it fit to pull out the knife to stab the victims.

32     Finally, in the third-step, I considered the various aggravating factors highlighted by the Prosecution and the mitigating factors submitted by the learned Counsel. In the Accused’s favour are his timely plea of guilt, his relatively young age of 23 years old, and his prospects for rehabilitation as demonstrated by his remorse in his personal hand-written mitigation plea, his resolve to continue with his higher education, his positive working attitude and to do better in his life.

33     As submitted by his learned Counsel, the Accused had acted on impulse and the physical altercation with the two victims were not pre-mediated. While I note that the two victims have accepted the Accused’s apology and compensation offer, and have forgiven him, as rightly pointed out by the learned DPP, forgiveness is a private matter between the victim and the offender, and should not affect the sentence imposed on the offender by the courts, and which reflects the public interest in criminal punishment: _Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> at para 45. Two possible exceptions are (i) where the sentence imposed on the offender would aggravate the victim’s distress, and (ii) the victim’s forgiveness is relevant to a determination of the harm the victim has suffered as a result of the offence. However, neither of these exceptions are present in this case.

34     Against these factors, I considered the aggravating factors, namely, that the Accused had committed the two separate and serious offences whilst he was released on supervision from RTC and whilst on bail. In respect of the s 324 PC charges, the offences were committed barely a few weeks after he was released on supervision from RTC.

35     I further note that this is not his first brush with the law. He had been placed on Probation for other violent and public-order offences such as affray, and for causing intentional alarm. The Accused breached the Probation when he was convicted of consuming a specified drug and sentenced to RT. For the breach of Probation, the Accused was similarly sentenced to RT.

36     Hence, notwithstanding his relatively young age and his rehabilitative prospects, I am also of the view that the other sentencing principles of retribution and deterrence, both general and specific, are applicable and engaged in this case. There is a need to deter like-minded persons from committing such violent offences of causing hurt with a dangerous weapon. Quite clearly, the Accused was not responsive to the rehabilitation programmes accorded to him when he was placed on Probation for his previous offending behaviour. Instead, he progressed to more serious offences and was sent to RT and committed these offences while released on supervision from RT.

37     Finally, there is also an additional s 324 PC charge involving the victim Toh that was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. In my assessment, taking all these factors into account, an uplift of two (2) months’ imprisonment as submitted by the Prosecution would be appropriate.

38     Accordingly, for the 2nd charge under s 324 PC charge, I imposed a sentence of **six (6) months and two (2) weeks’ imprisonment**.

### 3rd Charge under 6(1) CESOWA

39     I next turn to the 3rd Charge under s 6 of the CESOWA. This offence took place in September 2020 after the Accused was released from the RTC and was placed under supervision from 27 February 2020 to 27 February 2021. One of the requirements was that the Accused must not break the law. He was also on bail for the s 324 PC charges, and one of the bail conditions was that the Accused must not commit any offences while released on bail.

40     However, on the 20 September 2020, the Accused was captured on POLCAM footage carrying a knife at the void deck of Blk 806 Yishun Ring Road, in a public place. He left a trail of blood and was subsequently heard instructing someone over the phone to throw the knife away. The knife which the Accused was carrying without any lawful authority or lawful purpose was not recovered.

41     Both the learned DPP and the learned Counsel submitted that the sentencing tariff for this offence is six (6) months’ imprisonment and the mandatory minimum sentence of six (6) strokes of the cane. While they agreed that an uplift may be appropriate to take into account the fact that the Accused committed this offence whilst under RT supervision, they differed on whether it should be an uplift of two (2) weeks or one (1) month imprisonment.

42     The Accused committed this offence while he was released on supervision from the RTC, and when he was on bail for the s 324 PC charges. This is clearly an aggravating factor as it showed his disregard for the law and the conditions imposed on him not to break the law. Nevertheless, considering his timely plea of guilt, I am inclined to agree with his learned Counsel that an uplift of 2 weeks’ imprisonment would suffice.

43     Accordingly, for the 3rd charge under s 6(1) CESOWA, I imposed the sentence suggested by the learned Counsel of **six (6) months and two (2) weeks’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane**.

### Global sentence

44     It is common ground between the learned DPP and the learned Counsel that it would be appropriate to run the two sentences consecutively given that the two offences were unrelated events and the Accused should be separately punished for each of these offences. This accords with the general principle laid down in _Praveen Balakrishnan_.

45     I next turn to consider the totality principle in order to ensure that the global sentence is proportionate to the overall criminality and not excessive. Taking one ‘last look’, a consecutive sentence would yield an aggregate sentence of **12 months and four (4) weeks’ imprisonment and six (6) strokes of the cane**.

46     In my view, it cannot be said that the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for a s 324 PC offence where the maximum imprisonment term is seven (7) years, neither is the aggregate sentence a ‘crushing’ sentence on the Accused and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects, considering that the Accused was previously ordered to undergo the RT regime.

## Conclusion

47     In summary, for the 2nd charge under s 324 PC, I imposed a sentence of **six (6) months and two (2) weeks’ imprisonment**. For the 3rd charge under s 6(1) CESOWA, I imposed a sentence of **six (6) months and two (2) weeks’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane**.

48     The sentences were ordered to run consecutively, making a global sentence of **12 months and four (4) weeks’ imprisonment and six (6) strokes of the cane**.

49     The sentences were backdated and ordered to commence with effect from 22 March 2021, the date that the Accused was converted to remand after he completed serving his RT regime.

50     The Accused being dissatisfied with the decision had lodged an appeal against his sentence. He is currently serving sentence.
