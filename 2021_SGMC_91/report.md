### District Judge Chee Min Ping:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Teo Hwa Keat (Zhang Huaji), a 48-year-old, claimed trial to two charges. The charges were respectively for:

> (a)     Voluntarily causing hurt to one Chan Kin Kan, by hitting his right hand and back several times on 22 May 2018, at about 2.43 am at Blk 446 Fajar Road, Fajar Shopping Centre, Singapore, under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) (“VCH Charge”); and

> (b)     Committing mischief on 22 May 2018, at about 2.43 am at Blk 446 Fajar Road, Fajar Shopping Centre, Singapore, by damaging the front rear view mirror, mobile data terminal, NETS machine and front left door glass in the Transcab taxi bearing license plate number SHB9720 under s 427 of the Penal Code (“Mischief Charge”).

2       Following a trial on the VCH Charge and the Mischief Charge, the accused was convicted on both charges as the court found that the two charges were proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution. Thereafter, the accused pleaded guilty to one stood down charge, which related to the accused being drunk and incapable of taking care of himself under s 14(1) of the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act 2015 (Act 5 of 2015) at the material date and time in the vicinity of the material location (“LCA Charge”).

3       The accused was then sentenced as follows:

4       Pending the appeal against conviction and sentence filed by the accused, the court granted a stay on the sentence. The accused is presently on bail pending appeal.

## The Charges

5       The VCH Charge reads as follows:

> You, … \[Teo Hwa Keat (Zhang Huaji)\] … are charged that you, on 22 May 2018, at about 2.43 am, at Block 446 Fajar Road, Fajar Shopping Centre, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to Chan Kin Kan, by hitting Chan Kin Kan’s right hand and back several times and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code…

6       The Mischief Charge reads as follows:

> You, … \[Teo Hwa Keat (Zhang Huaji)\] … are charged that you, on 22 May 2018, at about 2.43 am, at Block 446 Fajar Road, Fajar Shopping Centre, Singapore, did commit mischief, to wit, by damaging the front rear view mirror, mobile data terminal, NETS machine and front left door glass in the Transcab taxi bearing license plate no SHB9720R, causing damages amounting to $2,180.58, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 427 of the Penal Code…

## The prosecution’s case

7       The prosecution relied in the main on the oral testimony of the victim named in the VCH Charge, Mr Chan Kin Kan, PW1. According to PW1, on 22 May 2018, the accused’s friend hailed the taxi driven by PW1, a Transcab taxi bearing license plate SHB9720R (“taxi”) at about 2.20 am at the Golden Mile Complex,[^1] though under cross-examination, PW1 stated that the location of pick up was at Golden Mile Tower.[^2] The accused’s friend informed PW1 to drive to Bukit Panjang, without stating a specific destination within Bukit Panjang.[^3] The accused then boarded the taxi and sat at the left rear passenger seat of the taxi.[^4] During the journey to Bukit Panjang, PW1 noticed that the accused was drunk as he was not speaking clearly and smelt of alcohol.[^5]_En route_ to Bukit Panjang, PW1 asked the accused repeatedly where the accused wanted to go in Bukit Panjang, but the accused did not answer.[^6] PW1 continued driving towards Bukit Panjang, despite the lack of certainty as to the precise destination that the accused was headed. PW1 testified that the accused said “Let’s go to Fajar” only when the taxi was near Fajar in Bukit Panjang and so the accused drove and stopped at the spot opposite Fajar Road Shopping Centre.[^7]

8       PW1 informed the accused that the taxi fare amounted to $23.70. The accused thereafter produced an assortment of Renminbi and Hong Kong dollars and PW1 informed the accused that the amount was insufficient to cover the taxi fare.[^8] Thereafter, the accused took out an ATM card to pay for the fare but the transaction was not successful after the accused entered his Personal Identification Number (“PIN”).[^9] PW1 then returned the card to the accused by extending PW1’s left hand backwards.[^10] The accused tried to make payment using another card which looked like a debit card, but the subsequent transaction was also unsuccessful.[^11] PW1 asked if the accused had any other currency, and the accused handed over a “Hong Kong MRT card” called “Ba Da Tong” and informed PW1 that there was sufficient value to pay for the taxi fare within the card.[^12] PW1 took the card and asked the accused to get down from the taxi.[^13]

9       The accused remained in the taxi thereafter and did not alight. PW1 told the accused to get down because PW1 needed to go about his business.[^14] The accused hit the rear left passenger armrest “with strong force” and said “I want to play to you till the end”[^15], and “You tell the Police to come here”[^16]. PW1 observed that the accused appeared angry at the time.[^17] PW1 indicated that he will call the police, and then walked towards Fajar Shopping Centre at the pickup point, where PW1 called the police for assistance, some 20 to 25 metres away from the taxi.[^18]

10     At that point, the accused rushed towards PW1, appearing furious, and said “You really called the police?”[^19] PW1 did not respond, and thereafter the accused rushed to the driver’s seat, removed the mobile phone stand to the front right hand side near the windscreen, and rushed towards PW1 to attack the latter.[^20] The accused rushed towards PW1 and hit PW1 a total of four times on the back and the hand.[^21] PW1 elaborated that PW1 had raised his hand up to defend himself when the accused rushed at him to hit him, which was when he was hit twice on his right hand on knuckle of his right middle finger.[^22] PW1 was also hit twice on his back near his right shoulder blade.[^23]

11     PW1’s evidence is that the accused used a “very strong force”[^24], which resulted in PW1 trying to “defend” and “shield” himself from the blow, which he could not do, and was instead hit on his back by the accused.[^25] PW1 then informed the accused to await the arrival of the police, and moved away from the accused.[^26] PW1 stated that thereafter, the accused made two attempts to attack him but was unsuccessful as there were passers-by looking at them.[^27]

12     The accused then went to the driver’s seat of the taxi and sat in the seat, leaving the door half open.[^28] PW1 was unsure of what the accused did while he was seated at the driver’s seat as PW was standing at the opposite side of the road some 20 to 25 meters away and could not see what the accused was doing.[^29] PW1 could see that the accused was “meddling with stuff inside”.[^30] At that time, the accused appeared drunk and angry,[^31] and PW1 made repeated calls to the police while waiting for the police.[^32] Thereafter, the police arrived and arrested the accused, and it was then that PW1 returned to the taxi and saw that within the taxi, it “was a mess”, because “stuff dropped out”, “it was very messy” and “wires were off”.[^33] PW1 also noticed that the windscreen and front left passenger window were cracked.[^34] On the police’s instructions, PW1 drove the taxi to a nearby police station where he made a police report and photographs were taken of the taxi as well as the interior of the taxi.[^35]

13     PW3 Senior Staff Sergeant Choo Ngai Pang and PW4 Iskandar Fuad bin Jumat gave evidence that at the material time, they were the first responding officers who responded to PW1’s call at the scene. Upon arrival, PW3 noted that PW1 was in a panic, some distance from the taxi near Fajar Shopping Centre.[^36] PW3 observed that the accused was in the driver’s seat of the taxi, reeking of alcohol and had to steady himself by holding on to the taxi.[^37] The accused was seen to be rowdy and raised his voice, shouting vulgarities, though PW3 was unable to recall the precise vulgar language used.[^38] When PW3 attempted to calm the accused down, the accused got more agitated and in fact hit the trunk of the taxi.[^39] As the accused persisted in causing a commotion and agitated behaviour, PW3 placed the accused under arrest.[^40] The accused struggled and despite the effecting of arrest, the accused continued to shout and use vulgarities.[^41] PW3’s account was essentially corroborated by PW4, who also responded to the first information report of the incident and assisted in effecting the arrest of the accused.[^42]

14     The prosecution relied on photographs taken of the taxi at the police station that day by PW4[^43], showing that the windscreen had sustained cracks and that the mobile data terminal of the taxi, the rear view mirror and the NETs machine was detached and left on the front left passenger seat of the taxi. At the time that these photos were taken, the lighting was dim.[^44] According to PW1, prior to the incident and before the accused entered the driver’s seat, the windscreen and front passenger side window of the taxi were not cracked.[^45] The mobile data terminal, rear view mirror and in-car camera were also not detached, and throughout the duration of the incident, the accused was the only person who had entered the taxi.[^46]

15     The prosecution also relied on an accident report (P3) filed by Transcab’s staff PW6 Loong Ghien Yee on the same day, with photos taken on 22 May 2018 at about 9.00 or 10.00 am in the presence of PW1.[^47] While the damage to the windows was less visible in P3, PW1 explained that the cracks were present during photo taking, but could have been less apparent due to the reflection of the clouds on the glass in question.[^48] PW6 also gave evidence that 2 cracks were visible on the right of the front windscreen at the time of phototaking,[^49] and that the front passenger window was also cracked at the time of photographing the taxi.[^50] PW1 also gave evidence identifying the items that were damaged in the taxi as depicted in the photographs collectively bundled in P2 and in the photographs in P3. While PW1 appeared to have difficulty identifying the rear view mirror from the photographs tendered by the prosecution, he eventually identified the rear view mirror whilst under cross-examination.[^51] PW6 explained that he had moved the mobile data terminal, NETS machine and in car camera from the front passenger seat floor mat to the front passenger seat to facilitate photographing of the items.[^52]

16     PW1 gave evidence that the following day, his hands became red and swollen and had no strength. He went to see a doctor on the same day and obtained 4 days’ MC, from 22 to 25 May 2018.[^53] The medical report (P4) prepared by PW2, Dr Winston Lin Hengjin, was admitted in evidence, stating PW2’s assessment as the examining doctor who saw the accused on 22 May 2018 at 7.30 pm at Elissa Medical Clinic. PW2 noted a slight erythema and mild tenderness over the right third metacarpal head, _ie_, the third knuckle on his right hand, and some right upper back and shoulder tenderness.[^54] PW2 diagnosed PW1 as having suffered from a contusion of his right hand and right upper back contusion.[^55] According to PW2, the injuries sustained were not inconsistent with an assault using a mobile phone stand on the right middle knuckle and on the back.[^56]

17     PW5, Ms Jasmine Tan Siew Kim, the general manager at Trans-Cab Services Private Limited, gave evidence that the taxi was sent for repairs at Trans-Cab’s workshop, and the repair cost was stated in P8.[^57] PW5 clarified that the front rear view mirror had been mistakenly described as the front side mirror in P8.[^58] The costs of repair are as follows:

18     PW5 testified that for the three and a half days that the taxi was in the workshop for repairs, the loss of rental sustained was a total of $340.80, computed at $97.37 per day of lost rental over three and a half days.[^59] The income loss to PW1 was computed at $50 per day over three days, totalling $150 over three days.[^60] The in-car camera would not have been repaired by Trans-cab, since that is the property of the driver that would have been returned to the driver and not part of Trans-cab’s property.[^61]

## The defence’s case

19     The defence put the following case to PW1. The accused had specifically informed PW1 that his destination was 446 Bukit Panjang.[^62]It should be noted, however, that during the accused’s evidence-in-chief, he stated that he had specifically instructed PW1 to drive him to 440 Fajar Road when he boarded the taxi.[^63] The defence case is that the accused was sleeping in the backseat during the journey from the point of pick up to Bukit Panjang and throughout the journey there was no conversation.[^64] Upon arrival at Blk 446 Bukit Panjang, PW1 informed that the fare was $39.[^65] The accused paid $32, leaving $7 unpaid. The accused informed PW1 that he lived on the second level of his apartment block and can go and take $7 to pay PW1.[^66]

20     PW1 then said in a mixture of Mandarin and Hokkien words that meant “I see our face and I know you will run. You will evade paying taxi fare” in an insulting and accusatory tone.[^67] The accused also said in a mixture of Hokkien and Mandarin that ““Uncle, don’t say like that. I leave my wallet, handphone, IC, everything with you. I stay 2nd floor only. I get the money for you.”[^68] PW1 allegedly replied in a mixture of Hokkien and Mandarin that “Cannot. You want to run. I see a lot of customer”.[^69] The accused then offered 50 Hong Kong dollars as payment for the remainder fare of $7, which PW1 rejected.[^70] The accused then passed to PW1 a POSB ATM card, and after trying to process payment with the POSB ATM card, PW1 threw it at the accused and said “No money”.[^71] The accused further suggested that he will head to a nearby ATM to withdraw money.[^72] During the accused’s evidence-in-chief, he stated that PW1 refused such an offer.[^73] In addition, the accused testified that PW1 had said “Your card could not be used, I see your face, I know you would run away”.[^74] The accused testified that he had suggested that PW1 calls the police since “\[t\]his you don’t accept, that you also don’t accept, then what else could I do?”[^75] The accused testified that PW1 then called the police and the accused went to an ATM machine 50 metres away to withdraw money.[^76]

21     The accused also testified that at that time, the accused had reached forward to reach for the in-car camera as he wanted to extract the footage, and thereafter PW1 reached out to stop the accused resulting in “a bit of snatching here and there” and “knocking here and there”, after which the in-car camera fell out.[^77]In the case put by the defence to PW1, there was a “vigorous pushing and pulling” to obtain possession of the in-car camera.[^78] During this time, the accused was in the middle of the backseat.[^79] The defence’s position is that the accused injured his right hand in the course of this struggle[^80]and hit his back against the taxi or equipment in the taxi.[^81] The defence’s case is that there was no physical altercation between PW1 and the accused outside the taxi subsequently.[^82] The defence’s case is also that while the accused was rowdy at the time that the police arrived at the scene and effected his arrest, he never physically resisted arrest.[^83]

22     The defence’s position, accepted by PW2, is that the injuries sustained by PW1 as documented in P4, were not inconsistent with the defence’s case.[^84]

23     The accused did not dispute intentionally damaging the windscreen and accepted that the process of “snatching” the in-car camera “might have damaged” some of the items in the taxi,[^85] including the windscreen, wiper, left passenger window and side mirror[^86]. By the accused’s own evidence, he remained furious after PW1 alighted from the taxi after the in car camera had fallen off, to call the police, and so he “damaged some parts in the car”, and “hit his car”, including throwing his fists against the windscreen, and using the rear view mirror to hit the windscreen.[^87]

24     The accused provided further elaboration during cross-examination, that during the struggle with PW1 for the in-car camera, the rear view mirror may have fallen off:[^88]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Alright. So, perhaps, you can take us through chrono---chronologically how did you damage each of the items, the 4 items you mentioned, the windscreen, wiper, the left side mirror, and the front left passenger window?

 |
| 

A

 | 

For the left side mirror, it is during the snatching of the in-car camera that it dropped. As for the windscreen, I took the side mirror to knock against the windscreen. I also used my fist to hit the windscreen, now I can recall. As for the wiper, I grabbed the wiper and broke it. As for the front left passenger window---the front left passenger seat window, not the window but the left side mirror, I used my hand to damage it. It might not have been broken but according to what I can recall I damaged it. As for the window, I used my fist to knock against it.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Parties, if you need to ask follow on questions after mine you---you can do so. I’m concerned about the---the part where you said that when you were snatching for the in-car camera---I---I got down that the left side mirror pro---I---I didn’t---I didn’t manage to record down fully but my impression was that you had said that the left side mirror probably detached during the snatching of the in-car camera. So, I wanted to be sure what were the precise words to---used to describe that mirror?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I’m referring to the rear view mirror. That is in the middle, placed in the middle.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Alright.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

During the process of the snatching it detached, it broke off.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Any follow on questions from this clarification?

 |
| 

Wee:

 | 

No, Your Honour. Actually, I was grateful for that because that is one of the areas which---if I’m not wrong the NEs would reflect it, but I think in EIC he said rear view but later the clarification he said left side mirror. So, we can be sure now it’s the mirror in the car, the rear.

 |

  
  

25     Under cross-examination, the accused also admitted to hitting the windscreen and breaking the wiper, as well as the “passenger seat’s side mirror”.[^89]

## The court’s findings

### A   The central issue was whether PW1’s testimony was unusually convincing, given the absence of footages and eyewitness accounts of the commission of the offences,

26     As pronounced by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”), the prosecution bears the unshifting legal burden of proving the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. On the other hand, the “evidential burden” is the burden to adduce sufficient evidence to raise an issue for consideration of the trier of fact (_GCK_ at \[132\]). While the evidential burden of proving facts to make out offences beyond a reasonable doubt generally rests with the prosecution, the evidential burden in respect of certain facts may lie on the defence depending on the nature of the accused’s defence and fact in issue raised (_GCK_ at \[133\]). The evidential burden may shift to the opposing part once discharged by the proponent (_Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 984</span> (“_Nabill_”) at \[69\]. As recently clarified by the Court of Appeal in _Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 103</span> (“_Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway_”) at \[77\]:

> … The evidential burden is the burden to produce sufficient evidence to keep a question of fact alive. If one side has raised credible evidence and the other side fails to engage with that or rebut it, then that other side will have failed to discharge _its_ evidential burden.

> \[emphasis in original\]

27     It was also clarified in _Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway_ (at \[78\]), that:

> …. First, because this discussion \[Nabill at \[70\] – \[71\]\] concerned the duty to call a “material witness”, we emphasised that the Prosecution would not have to call a material witness if the Prosecution could discharge its evidential burden by recourse to other evidence (such as closed circuit television records). Second, and really by way of reiterating the initial point, which is the necessity for _the Defence_ to first raise sufficient evidence to put a defence properly in issue, we said there would be no question of the Prosecution having to discharge its evidential burden by calling a material witness “_if the accused person’s defence is patently and inherently incredible to begin with”_ … To put it simply, where this is the case, the accused person would not have raised sufficient evidence to put his defence properly in issue.

> \[emphasis in original\]

28     Hence, in _GCK_ at \[145\], the court held that where the overall legal burden was on the prosecution, the accused person’s evidential burden is to point to such evidence as is “capable of generating a _reasonable doubt”_ \[emphasis in original\]. As the Court of Appeal emphasised in _Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway_, the principles relating to the burden of proof stated at \[79\] – \[81\] were established law which were not changed in any way as a result of pronouncements made in _Nabill._ The “unusually convincing” standard is applicable to any eyewitness evidence, where the testimony is uncorroborated and forms the sole basis for a conviction: _GCK_ at \[89\].

29     In the present case, there was no objective evidence corroborating PW1’s account put forward by the prosecution relating to the accused’s _commission of the_ alleged assault particularised in the VCH Charge, and the Mischief Charge. The defence cross-examined the investigation officer, PW7 Assistant Superintendent of Police Mila Alyssa, regarding the reason for the non-availability of the in-car camera footage which should have been obtained to ascertain the true version of events.[^90]

30     PW7 stated that the in-car camera was not seized as it was damaged, and returned to the taxi company for evaluation of damages.[^91] According to PW7, she would have followed up immediately to obtain the in-car camera footage.[^92] PW7 also gave evidence that she had checked with Transcab’s representative to obtain the in-car camera footage, and was informed that no footage was available.[^93] However, PW7 was not informed that the in-car camera was not one of the items repaired by Transcab and had been returned to the driver.[^94]

31     PW7 recalled that in any event, a colleague assisted to call PW1 to check whether the camera footage was not available, though it was not apparent why footage was not available.[^95] A colleague’s assistance was necessary as PW1 spoke in Mandarin, a language that PW7 was not conversant in. PW7 also recounted checking with first responding officers, PW3 and PW4, on whether there were CCTV cameras around the region that would have captured the incident, and received confirmation that there were none.[^96] PW7 also stated that she did not follow up on calls made to the police regarding the incident to obtain eye witness accounts, as PW7 was confident that the accounts of PW1, the accused and taxi company were sufficient for the purpose of investigations.[^97]

32     Upon re-examination, PW7 clarified that the first responders (PW3 and PW4) at the scene had not in fact identified any eyewitnesses, because if they had done so, she would have requested that they record the eye witness particulars for subsequent follow up.[^98] To PW7’s knowledge, the first responders were instructed to ascertain whether there were cameras pointing at the location of the incident, and PW7 recalled that there were none.[^99] As far as the in-car camera footage was concerned, PW7 had made the necessary inquiries to check whether footages existed, and saw no reason to physically make a check on the in-car camera when she was informed that there were no footages.[^100]

33     Objective evidence of the altercation in the form of in-car camera footages and the CCTV footages would have shed light on the true sequence of events. There was evidence indicating that following checks performed by the police at the vicinity of the incident, it was ascertained that there were no CCTVs pointing at the incident location at the material time.

34     With respect to the in-car camera footage in particular, there was evidence that PW7 had enquired and was informed by PW1 and the taxi company that the in-car camera footage was unavailable. However, there was no evidence produced that shed light on the reason for the non-availability of the in-car camera footage. There was no evidence indicating whether enquiries were subsequently made on whether there was any storage media within the in-car camera, and whether the storage media within the in car camera footage was available for the footage to be examined on another device, even if the in-car camera had been damaged during the incident. The reason for this was not provided at the trial, and it was unclear whether, if retrieved at the material time, the storage media would have contained footage or sound recordings relevant to the issues in dispute.

35     However, it was also necessary to have regard to the fact that PW1’s account of the struggle within the taxi for the in-car camera was not raised in P11, a statement recorded from the accused shortly in the aftermath of the incident. There was also no evidence before this court that the accused’s account at trial of an altercation within the taxi was raised to the police before the trial. The defence’s case put to PW7 (which formed no part of the accused’s evidence-in-chief) is that the accused had purportedly made several requests for the in-car camera footage, and did not suggest that the accused had explained why he thought that the in-car camera footage might shed light on the true events.[^101]

36     Ultimately, in light of the absence of other objective evidence (including footages) it fell to the court to assess the veracity of PW1’s account by examining its internal consistency, and for external consistency with the other evidence placed before the court by the prosecution (_GCK_ at \[137\]). In particular, such other evidence comprised primarily the accounts of first responding officers PW3 and PW4 of the events transpiring after they responded to PW1’s call to the police, as well as documentary evidence of PW2’s assessment of injuries to PW1 in the aftermath of the incident, and documentation of the observations made by witnesses of the damage to the taxi. As the accused has given a differing account of events at the material time, and the location of the altercation resulting in the injuries and damage to items within the taxi, it was ultimately for the court to determine whether PW1’s account was unusually convincing such that it formed the basis of the accused’s conviction.

### B   PW1’s testimony was unusually convincing

#### (i)   PW1’s testimony was internally and externally consistent in material aspects

37     The account of PW1 was not only internally consistent and also externally consistent in relation to the material aspects of the prosecution’s case. During the trial, PW1 required interpretation in Mandarin, and at times also required repetition or clarification to enable him to properly understand the questions posed and to communicate and clarify his answers. On the overall, PW1 gave evidence in a straightforward manner that suggested a lack of embellishment or sophistry, both in relation to the events that had transpired after the accused boarded his taxi, upon arrival opposite Fajar Road Shopping Centre, and in relation to the events transpiring at the material time.

38     PW1 rendered a consistent and detailed account of how he came to sustain the injures to his right hand and back, including the manner in which the injuries were inflicted, _viz_, that he was hit twice on his right middle knuckle and on the right of his back, with the mobile phone stand which the accused had retrieved from the right side of the driver’s seat from the windscreen and the location of the injuries (see above at \[9\] – \[11\]) with a strong force. The fact that the accused had sustained injury on his right hand and back was corroborated by PW2’s observation and diagnosis when PW2 performed a medical examination on PW1, as documented in P4 (see above at \[16\]).

39     As for the damage to the taxi, PW1 was candid that he did not personally witness, how the passenger window and the interior of the taxi was damaged by the accused because PW1 stood some 20 to 25 metres away to avoid the accused after the accused attacked him. PW1 was also clear that prior to the accused entering the driver’s seat, the items in question were intact, but that there had been damage to the bottom portion of the taxi as depicted in P2-22 from a past incident that had nothing to do with the accused.[^102]

40     PW1’s account of the accused’s demeanour after the assault was corroborated by the first responding officers PW3 and PW4, in that they had arrived at the scene to see that the accused was in the driver’s seat of the taxi, rowdy and appearing drunk. PW3’s and PW4’s observations upon arrival at the scene were consistent with PW1’s description of the accused’s demeanour, and corroborates PW1’s description of the state that the taxi was in after the accused had stepped out and the arrest was effected (see above at \[13\]).

41     In the defence’s closing submissions, counsel for the accused raised several alleged inconsistencies or logical fallacies in PW1’s evidence which, according to the defence, cast doubt on PW1’s credibility and reliability as a witness. These alleged inconsistencies or logical difficulties are listed as follows and will be analysed in turn:

> (a)     PW1 gave inconsistent accounts relating to whether it was the accused’s friend who hailed his taxi and whether it was the accused who specified a location upon boarding the taxi.[^103]

> (b)     While PW1 stated in evidence-in-chief that he was in a rush to send the accused to Bukit Panjang and stopped asking the accused repeatedly where his specific destination was,[^104] PW1 disputed that he had said so under cross-examination.[^105] PW1 also failed to explain why he did not simply ask the accused’s friend for the specific location within Bukit Panjang if the accused appeared drunk. The defence submitted that PW1 had deceitfully given the impression that he had asked the accused’s friend for the destination by suggesting that the accused’s friend was unable to answer.[^106]

> (c)     While PW1 initially stated that the accused took out his ATM to make payment, PW1 changed his evidence under cross examination to say that he had been the one who suggested that the accused makes payment by NETs.[^107]

> (d)     PW1 assumed that the accused entered the wrong PIN number, when the transaction could have been unsuccessful due to insufficient funds. PW1 also assumed that subsequently, the debit card handed over by the accused to PW1 had expired when the transaction failed. The defence submitted that PW1’s assumptions undermine the cogency of his evidence as it is not clear which portions of his evidence contained objective truth and which portions were assumptions.[^108]

> (e)     PW1 was not forthright about how he made his request to the accused to get out of his car, after the various payment modes attempted had all failed, and that the first sign of aggression had emanated from PW1.[^109]

> (f)     While PW1 stated in his evidence-in-chief that the money given by the accused would be insufficient to pay the fare, he later on stated inconsistently under cross-examination that he did not know what the value of stored funds in the “Ba Da Tong” card was.[^110]

> (g)     PW1 was unable to cogently explain how the presence of passers-by prevented the accused from further assaulting PW1 after the initial alleged assault or how he managed to see the accused’s expression from 20 to 25 meters away after the accused had entered the driver’s seat.[^111]

> (h)     PW1 had changed his version on the number of attempted and actual physical altercations there were, and whether it was during the second alteration that the accused was hit on the back which suggests that PW1’s account in relation to the assaults was a lie.[^112]

> (i)     While PW1 stated that he was given no instructions to go anywhere by the police, he later stated that he had driven the taxi to the police station on instructions of the police.[^113]

> (j)     PW1 claimed that the accused had damaged the windscreen despite testifying in EIC that he had not seen the accused do so. PW1 claimed illogically to be able to see the accused’s angry expression although PW1 also maintains that he was unable to see what the accused was doing in the taxi from 20 to 25 meters away.[^114]

> (k)     PW1 has demonstrated a tendency to offer illogical explanations when confronted with his mistake in identifying the windscreen and the rear view mirror, which renders his credibility suspect.[^115]

42     In my view, some of the alleged inconsistencies were contrived to cast doubt on the veracity of PW1’s evidence. For instance, in relation to \[41(a)\] above, PW1 had clearly clarified his evidence that it was the accused’s friend who hailed the taxi, and PW1 had clearly given an inconsistent account.[^116]

> Q    Okay. Now, you testified that it was my client’s friend who hailed your taxi, correct?

> A    Yes. I need to explain further. Because then, when the accused came up, he said that the location was Golden Mile Tower---not Golden Mile Complex but Golden Mile Tower.

> Q    Sorry, you are saying that the accused told you this?

> A    No. I recall now at Golden Mile Tower---at Golden---Golden Mile Tower, the accused’s friend hailed my cab.

> Q    Okay. Correct. So, the accused’s friend hailed your cab, correct?

> A    Yes.

43     However, read in the context of PW1’s entire testimony, PW1’s account was internally consistent in material aspects. The defence’s submissions relating to PW1’s credibility will be elaborated upon below at \[44\] – \[63\].

#### (ii)   PW1’s decision to drive towards Bukit Panjang and to check with the accused on the precise destination en route was not illogical or inconsistent.

44     With reference to \[41(b)\] above, PW1 had stated in his evidence-in-chief that he was in a rush to head to Bukit Panjang, a statement which he later denied stating under cross-examination.[^117] PW1 was not asked to explain the contradiction in re-examination. However, it was not clear from the defence’s submissions how it was relevant that PW1 had felt any time pressure to move off from the pick up location after the accused boarded the taxi, and drive towards Bukit Panjang. In my view, even if PW1 felt any time pressure to drive off after the accused boarded his taxi, it did not mean that, therefore, PW1 was more or less inclined to be in an argument over the fare to be paid for the trip, or any altercation thereafter.

45     Read in the context of PW1’s examination-in-chief, the essential point emphasised by PW1 is that he had decided to move off after the accused boarded his taxi and the accused’s friend had conveyed that the destination was in Bukit Panjang.[^118] He had also explained that he would ultimately rely on the passenger for the specific address, as it would tend to be the case that PW1 would require to check with his passenger for the precise destination. This explanation was a statement of his personal experience and approach, and did not undermine the credibility of his account that he had, in the course of the journey to Bukit Panjang, repeatedly asked the accused where he wanted to go, and received no specific directions from the accused, save for the accused’s indication that he wanted to go to Fajar when the taxi was near Fajar in Bukit Panjang.[^119]

#### (iii)   PW1’s account of the events upon arrival in the vicinity of Fajar Road Shopping Centre was consistent and cogent.

46     Similarly, the purported inconsistencies or logical fallacies raised by defence in \[41(c)\], \[41(d)\], and \[41(f)\] above pertaining to the sequence of suggested modes of payment for the taxi did not appear material or go to show that PW1 was not an unreliable or untruthful witness.

47     On the contrary, PW1 had recounted the sequence of evidence consistently in his evidence, _viz_, that the accused had first attempted to pay using Hong Kong currency and Renminbi, which was insufficient. The accused then made unsuccessful attempts to pay by NETS followed by a debit card because the respective transactions were declined, and finally handed over of a “Ba Da Tong” card. With reference specifically to \[41(f)\] above, it was hardly surprising that PW1 should state that he did not know for a fact the stored value in the “Ba Da Tong” card was sufficient to cover the taxi fare, since all he had was the accused’s assurance that the amount was sufficient, at the material time.

#### (iv)   PW1’s account of how the accused inflicted the four blows upon PW1’s right hand and back was consistent

48     The alleged inconsistencies or “logical fallacies” in \[41(g)\] and \[41(h)\] above related to the VCH Charge. PW1 had consistently maintained that he had sustained a total of four blows from the accused who had rushed at him with a mobile phone stand which the accused took from the right side of the taxi windscreen. PW1 was consistent during his evidence-in-chief and under cross-examination that he was first hit twice on the hand and twice on the back, after he tried unsuccessfully to block the blows using his hands after the accused rushed at him with a mobile phone stand obtained from the taxi.[^120] The fact that PW1 clarified that the four blows were inflicted, after the accused rushed at him not once but twice, did not suggest that PW1 was untruthful or that his testimony was unreliable[^121].

49     To begin with, PW1’s account under evidence-in-chief was that the accused had rushed at him more than once. According to PW1, the accused first rushed at him after he alighted from the taxi to call the police:[^122]

> Q    Okay. So, Mr. Chan, having spoken about what took place in the taxi that day, let’s get back to what happened after you alighted from the taxi as you mentioned, to call the police. Alright. So, that day, you mentioned that you alighted the taxi to call the police.

> A    Yes.

> Q    Alright. And when you did so, how did the accused respond?

> A    So, when I took the phone out---when I took the phone out to call the police, and I was out of the car, _he then got out from the car and he rushed towards me._

> \[emphasis added\]

50     Thereafter, the accused asked PW1 if he really did call the police, following which PW1 did not engage the accused further. The accused then entered the driver’s seat of the taxi to retrieve the mobile phone stand. Read in context, PW1’s evidence is that the accused once again rushed at him, and he was hit a total of four times. The questions posed to PW1 in evidence-in-chief and PW1’s answers reveal that the focus was on the total number of times PW1 was hit and on the parts of PW1’s body attacked:[^123]

>   
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Alright. And after the accused took the mobile phone stand from the taxi, where did he go next?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_He rushed towards me_ **_again._**

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_And what did he do when he rushed towards you?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_He wanted to---he wanted to attack me---to hit me._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Did he hit you that day?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Yes, he did._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Did he hit you with anything?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_He used the mobile phone stand and towards my direction, he hit me._

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, just to confirm, you said, “He used the mobile phone holder towards my direction and he hit me”?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Towards---towards my head and hit.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, before we proceed, did he hit you with the mobile phone holder?

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

DPP, I think, according to record, the translation or rather the interpretation was “mobile phone stand”. I’m not sure---

 |
| 

Chua:

 | 

Oh,---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

if anything---

 |
| 

Chua:

 | 

mobile phone---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

turns on.

 |
| 

Chua:

 | 

yes, apologies, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. So, I rephrase my question. Did he hit you with the mobile phone stand?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_How many times did he hit you with the mobile phone stand?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_4 times._

 |
| 

\[emphasis added; emphasis in bold added\]

 |

  
  

51     In response to questions on the location where PW1 was hit by the mobile phone stand, PW1’s answer in his evidence-in-chief was consistent not only in relation to the precise body parts that had sustained the assaults, but also as to the number strikes from the accused:[^124]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Maybe we can---maybe I will just interrupt. Apologies. Now, Mr. Chan, we’ll do this step by step, alright. So, I noticed earlier you were pointing towards various parts of your body. So, we start from the right hand first. Alright. So, can you point to the Court which part of your right hand you were hit at by the mobile phone ho---mobile phone stand?

 |
| 

A

 | 

The back of my right hand when I was defending. It was very painful.

 |
| 

Chua:

 | 

Alright. Your Honour, just to put on record, the witness is pointing to the right hand where his 3rd knuckle is. If Madam Interpreter can confirm given that she’s seated beside him as well.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, near to the---to the middle knuckle.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

A

 | 

It was very painful that time.

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Alright. And how many times did he hit your right hand at where you had pointed near the middle knuckle?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_2 times. And 2 times on my back._

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, we move on to talk about your back. Can you point for the Court which part of your back you were hit at with the mobile phone holder---

 |
| 

Chua:

 | 

mobile phone stand, apologies, Your Honour.

 |
| 

A

 | 

It was on the right-hand side, my---yah, my back. The right-hand side of my back.

 |
| 

Chua:

 | 

Just to put on record, Your Honour, the witness had pointed to his, I believe shoulder blade. Maybe, Madam Interpreter can confirm that.

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

\[emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

52     There were also questions in evidence-in-chief that focussed on how he sustained injury to his back, which lead to PW1’s testimony relating to the “2 attempts to attack me”, and exactly how many and which attempts were “unsuccessful”:[^125]

>   
| 

_Chua:_

 | 

_Yes. “How did your right back get hit?”_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Because I was trying to defend. He---he uses a very strong force. I couldn’t---I was unable to protect myself from that blow, so I used my back. So, I tried to---I tried to defend myself against that blow, but I---I couldn’t shield from that blow, so my back was hit instead._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Alright. So, when the accused hit you that day, how did you respond?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_I---I immediately said that with, “Wait for the police to come, do not be reckless.”_

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Did you move away at that time?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, I moved away. I---I told him, “Wait for the police to come.”

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Alright. And after that---after you told him to wait for the police to come and moved away, did the accused continue to hit you?

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_There---there were 2 times when he attempted to attack me._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Was he successful in doing so?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Because at that point in time, there were passers-by, it was unsuccessful._

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Can you explain what is the relation between the fact that there were passers-by and the fact the he was unsuccessful in attacking you again?

 |
| 

A

 | 

When he was charging towards me, I moved away from him. So, there were passers-by looking at us.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Alright. And after these 2 attempts by the accused to attack you as you mentioned and the fact that he was unsuccessful because you moved away, did he continue to hit you or attack you any further?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Subsequently, he ran back to the driver’s seat.

 |
| 

\[emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

PW1’s statement that “\[t\]here were 2 times when he attempted to attack me”, did not clearly communicate whether he meant that there were a total of two attempts to attack him (including the infliction of the four blows that were the subject of the VCH Charge), or whether he meant _further_ attempts to attack him, after he had sustained the four blows by the accused using the mobile phone stand.

53     PW1 had, during his evidence-in-chief, sought to provide an explanation of the background relating the accused accused’s assault in evidence-in-chief, but was directed to focus on describing the manner of assault:

> Q    Alright. So, before we proceed, you said that he hit your right hand, correct?

> A    I wish to add on.

> Q    Alright, please proceed.

> A    Before I was hit, there was a Malay guy. It was a Malay old man. He wanted to help me settle. He even wanted to hit the Malay man.

> Q    Now, Mr. Chan, I’ll focus today on he---how he hit you, alright. Alright. So, you said he hit you on the right hand. Can you point for the Court which part of your right hand did he hit you at with the mobile phone stand?

> A    When---when I was trying to defend myself, it was at this part.

54     During the accused’s cross-examination, it became clear that counsel for the accused had understood that PW1’s evidence was that there were a total of two attempts to attack PW1, in which one attempt was successful and the second was not,[^126] while the prosecution’s understanding was that PW1 had stated that there were two attempts to assault PW1 _after_ he was hit four times with the mobile phone stand.[^127] It was in the light of these opposing interpretations of PW1’s testimony that PW1 provided clarification as to the sequence of events, and doing so in my view did not undermine PW1’s overall credibility.

55     In this context, PW1’s evidence relating to the number of times that he had perceived that the accused rushed towards PW1 was clarified as follows:[^128]

> Q    Okay. Well, can you describe to me in a little bit more detail how the---how my client had hit you? So, you said he hit you twice on the right hand, correct?

> A    Like that, raised his hand from above in a downward motion, he hit.

> Wee:  Your Honour, to describe and put on record, the witness is raising his right-hand in a upward fashion towards his ear and striking down like in a hammer motion.

> Q    So, he did this twice, is it? So, the manner---

> A    Yes.

> Q    4 times? So, how he hit you 4 times is in the exact same manner, hammer fashion?

> A    So, the---the accused raised his hand from an upward---from---hitting me from an upward position and I used my hand to defend---to block the blow.

> Q    Okay. Were you successful in blocking the blow?

> A    My right hand was hit.

> Q    Okay. 2 times, correct?

> A    Yes.

> _Q_      _So, consecutively 2 times straight, right? First time on the right hand, second time on the right hand, correct?_

> _A_      _Yes, my right hand was hit twice. My back was hit twice._

> Q    Okay. So, on your right hand, the hits were at the same area, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. So, what happened after you were hit twice on the right hand? What did you do?

> A    I felt painful.

> Q    Okay.

> A    Very painful.

> Q    And the client---my client was not showing any signs of calming down, correct?

> A    Then he was very agitated.

> Q    Correct. So, after hitting you twice and you---and you blocked with your right hand twice, what did you do?

> A    I shouted to stop him. To say, “Wait for the police to come.”

> Q    And what did you respond?

> A    So, I avoided him and he returned to my driver’s seat.

> Q    Okay. No, Witness, you missed out a very important part. The part of you being hit on your back, correct?

> **_A_**      **_It should be the second time when he rushed towards me again. I think it was---there was at least 2 times when he rushed towards me._**

> Q    You think? Can you be sure or are you leaving it to you think?

> A    I’m sure.

> \[emphasis in bold italics added\]

56     Upon PW1’s clarification, his evidence was that the accused had rushed at PW1 twice in order to hit him, but the consistent evidence from PW1 was that he was hit a total of four times. PW1 clarified that the accused had made one subsequent attempt to further assault him thereafter which was unsuccessful, which the accused did not follow through with due to greater number of passers-by at the scene by that time:

> Q    Witness, can I ask you, how many times did the---my client try to attack you in total?

> A    At least 2 times.

> Q    2 times---at least 2 times? Can you be sure or are you leaving it to it’s at least 2 times?

> A    More than 2 times.

> Q    “More than 2 times”, okay. How many times then?

> A    3 times, probably.

> Q    “Probably”. Can you be sure that it’s 3 times?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. Okay. So, you said that the 2 times---the following 2 times were unsuccessful, correct?

> A    The last time---the last attempt was unsuccessful.

> Q    “The last attempt was unsuccessful.”

> A    Mmm. \[as spoken by the Witness\]

> Q    So, to be clear now, you’re saying the 1st attempt, he hit you twice on the hand, correct? Correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. The second time---was the second time successful?

> A    The second time was toward hitting my back.

> Q    Okay. So, a successful, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. And this was 2 times on the back?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. And then there was a third time, correct? And this one was not successful?

> A    Yes, the third attempt was unsuccessful.

> Q    And you said it’s because there were passerbys, correct?

> A    Yes,---

> Q    And you also---

> A    passersby.

> Q    said that you moved away from him, correct?

> A    I was all the way at the opposite side. I was in front of the shopping centre.

> …

> Q    So, why not just run away from him? It was unsuccessful in the third time. Why not---why---why didn’t you do it the first and second time?

> A    If I---if I ran away, how am I supposed to wait for the police to come?

> Q    But you run away in the third time, correct?

> A    It’s not run away. I was at the same spot. I just moved aside a few steps. I just moved a few steps aside.

> Q    Okay. Why couldn’t you have done that as well, move aside so as to avoid an attack?

> A    I did move aside. When---when he attacked me, I tried to avoid his blow, but I could not avoid it.

> Q    So, now you’re saying in all 3 times, you also tried to dodge his attacks, is that it?

> A    Yes, when he has actions, I would have actions to avoid him.

> **_Q_**      **_Why did you not say this in your Evidence-in-Chief?_**

> **_A_**      **_Because you asked me now and I tried to get you to understand._**

> \[emphasis in bold italics added\]

57     The clarification provided at \[55\] – \[56\] above did not, in my view, suggest that PW1 was being economical with the truth or prevaricating. This is especially since PW1 had been otherwise consistent pertaining to the manner in which the four blows were inflicted by the accused on PW1 at the material time.

#### (v)   PW1 had consistently maintained that the accused was the only person in the driver’s seat at the material time shortly before items in the interior of the taxi were found damaged

58     In relation to \[41(j)\] above, PW1 had been consistent that he had not seen how the accused inflicted damage on the taxi, but that the accused was the only person in the driver’s seat after he was assaulted. Counsel for the accused suggested that PW1 had given an internally consistent account when PW1 claimed to have seen the accused hit the windscreen when PW1 had not. However, if his cross-examination responses were read in its entire context, it can be understood that in fact, PW1 had been consistently stating that he discovered the damages to the taxi after the event because he was standing some distance away from the taxi while the accused was in the driver’s seat. During his evidence-in-chief, PW1 stated:[^129]

**_Perhaps, I can just reiterate my question. I don’t believe the witness had heard the question properly._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So after, Mr. Chan, after this incident with the passenger that day, you said that you went back to your taxi and you noticed your taxi was in a mess. At that point did you notice this crack to the windscreen?

 |
| 

**_A_**

 | 

**_I only---I notice---I notice that it was very messy inside the taxi and I also notice that there was a crack on the screen._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, before you alighted from the taxi to call the police, was there a crack on the windscreen?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No. There was no such thing. It was---it was original.

 |
| 

\[emphasis in bold italics added\]

59     In fact, PW1 was clear that it was a conjecture on his part that it might have been the accused who damaged the front windscreen, and how that was done. PW1’s position was in fact clarified in the course of cross-examination, that PW1 was in fact making a conjecture and did not claim to have witnessed the accused damage the windscreen from 20 to 25 minutes away. PW1’s account that it could only have been the accused who had damaged the windscreen which was, prior to the altercation, intact, was in fact corroborated by the accused’s own admissions that he had damaged the windscreen, in P11, and in court (see \[23\] above):

>   
| 

Q

 | 

And did you see my client actually hitting or damaging this---the window screen and the passenger door? Did you explicitly see him hitting these two?

 |
| 

A

 | 

From a far distance, I could see that.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, this one you saw? You saw him damaging these 2---2 areas? Okay.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, very clearly.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Then, why when I said earlier, “Did you notice him damaging any of your---of the---of the taxi?” Why did you say that you didn’t manage to see---see him doing it?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I saw it. From a far distance, there’s only him inside---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Who else could that be?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

**_Witness, you must understand the question here._** On one hand, you’re saying that he is the only person in the car which you observe. He’s the only person you saw in the car and therefore the damages must be done by him. But your second---your---your second version is that you explicitly saw him hitting the windscreen and the door the---and the---and the window of the passenger door. So, which is it? Are you saying that he is the only one in there therefore the damages must have happened or did you actually see him hitting the windscreen and the window of the passenger door? Which is it, Witness?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Even though from a distance 20 to 25 metres away, but from this distance I could see.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, you saw him hitting the windscreen and the passenger door window---front passenger door window?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

**_Q_**

 | 

**_Alright. Please describe to the Court how did he do this?_**

 |
| 

**_A_**

 | 

**_Then you have to ask him._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No. I’m asking you, Witness. You said that you saw him did the front win---window screen.

 |
| 

Chua:

 | 

I don’t think there’s a need to shout, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

and the passenger door.

 |
| 

Wee:

 | 

I’m trying to \[inaudible\] of Cross-Examination.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And the front passenger door. So, don’t ask me to ask my client. You said you saw this happening. So, answer the question, Witness. How did this happen?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It happened on that day.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

I am not asking you when it happened. I’m asking you how it happened. How did he do this? How did he hit the windscreen and the front passenger window door?

 |
| 

A

 | 

For the windscreen, it need a certain kind of force to break it.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Witness, listen to the question.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I---I guess. I guess that the accused **_might have used the mobile stand charger_**\---the mobile stand, sorry, or the rear-view mirror. He might have used the mobile phone stand or the rear-view mirror to hit the windscreen. Only objects like this would have created a force enough to break the windscreen.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. So, I repeat. **_You guessed that one of these items were used and that caused of crack in the windscreen, correct?_** Witness, correct? Witness, it’s very difficult to record evidence if there are two talking at the same time. Alright? So, please just confirm with me what you said just now that you guessed one of the items such as the mobile phone stand or the rear-view mirror was used to hit and that’s what caused the cracks. Correct? That’s your answer. Okay.

 |
| 

**_A_**

 | 

**_Yes._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay.

#### (vi)   PW1’s testimony in court suggested that clarification of answers and repetition of questions was required in some instances

60     In relation to \[41(a)\] above, the defence submits that the following is an instance of inconsistency since PW1 had also stated that the accused’s friend had hailed his taxi and instructed PW1 to drive to Bukit Panjang after the accused had boarded the taxi:[^130]

> Q    Okay. Now, you testified that it was my client’s friend who hailed your taxi, correct?

> A    Yes. I need to explain further. Because then, when the accused came up, he said that the location was Golden Mile Tower---not Golden Mile Complex but Golden Mile Tower.

> Q    Sorry, you are saying that the accused told you this?

> A    No. I recall now at Golden Mile Tower---at Golden---Golden Mile Tower, the accused’s friend hailed my cab.

> Q    Okay. Correct. So, the accused’s friend hailed your cab, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. And then you said that it is the accused’s friend who told you where to go, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And he told you Bukit Panjang, correct?

> A    Yes.

61     With respect, I am unable to see how the excerpted exchange was anything but an instance of PW1 clarifying what he meant to communicate, that the accused’s friend had hailed his taxi at Golden Mile Tower rather than Golden Mile Complex. This was evidently not an instance of PW1 changing his account regarding the identity of the person who hailed his taxi at the material time, and issued instructions to drive to Bukit Panjang.

62     \[41(i)\] related to an apparent inconsistency in PW1’s evidence relating to whether the police had requested that he drove the taxi to a nearby police station after the incident, and after PW3 and PW4 had attended at the scene. \[41(i)\] was raised by counsel as an instance of internal inconsistency in PW1’s evidence. As mentioned above at \[37\], PW1’s evidence in certain respects demonstrated that PW1 tended to require clarifications and repetition at times in order to clearly understand the questions posed and to provide an answer addressing the question posed. PW1’s account that following the police’s arrival and arrest of the accused, he was requested to drive to a nearby police station and to make a police statement was in fact corroborated by PW3 and not an instance of internal or external inconsistency.[^131]

63     \[41(k)\] related to the difficulty that PW1 seemed to have identifying the damaged rear view mirror in the taxi in its post-incident state, from viewing photographs. According to the defence’s submission, PW1 had inexplicably, during evidence-in-chief, initially misidentified the rear view mirror depicted in photographs as a camera, resulting in a number of questions posed both in evidence-in-chief and cross-examination to clarify his evidence.[^132] The difficulty displayed by PW1 in identifying the rear view mirror indicated his lack of familiarity with the rear view mirror in its post-destruction state, which would not be unexpected because it was PW1’s evidence that he had only seen a messy taxi with a number of damaged items, including the rear view mirror, after the accused was required to step out of the driver’s seat of the taxi by PW3 in the aftermath of the incident. In addition, this was also another instance of PW1’s display that he was a straightforward witness, but at times required repetition and clarification in order to understand and address the questions posed. Pursuant to clarification from counsel for the defence, PW1 acknowledged his prior error in identifying the rear view mirror and accurately identified the rear view mirror from the photographs.[^133] This in and of itself did not undermine his credibility or reliability as a witness on material issues.

### C   The accused’s account of events lacked credibility and did not raise a reasonable doubt

64     The assessment of whether PW1’s account was unusually convincing must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence which necessarily includes the defence’s case (_GCK_ at \[143\] and \[148\]). The evaluative task at this stage is comparative in nature, and the court should consider weaknesses in the case mounted by the defence as part of the assessment of the totality of the evidence (_GCK_ at \[144\]).

#### (i)   The accused’s account of an altercation within the taxi for the in-car camera was not mentioned in his statement to the police, P11

65     The accused’s account of the exchange between him and PW1 in the taxi and after the taxi stopped opposite Fajar Shopping Centre that prompted him to have an altercation with PW1 in order to snatch the in-car camera was inconsistent with the contents of P11, a statement which the accused gave to the police on 22 May 2018 at 10.07 am. P11 was admitted without any objection as to admissibility after the accused had the opportunity to consult counsel regarding the admissibility of P11. In P11, the accused stated that:

> … From my memory, I do not think that there was any dispute or incident happened along the way. I have fell asleep along the way.

> 4    I could not recall the time that I have reached the destination. Upon reaching, I believe that the taxi driver has woken me up. From my memory recollection, I did try to pay the taxi fare with cash but it was insufficient. I then used my POSB ATM to make the payment by NETs but the transaction was unable to go through due to insufficient fund. I told the taxi driver not to panic and I will go to my sister’s place to retrieve cash. I suggested to either place by wallet with my identification document or my handphone with him as a form of insurance that I will return after retrieving the cash. However, the taxi driver refused to accept. I roughly could recall that I cash short about $7 or $8 for the fare.

> 5    At that moment, I got off from the taxi with the intention to go to my sister’s place to retrieve cash for payment and the taxi driver refused to let me leave. I believed that he worried that I would evaded from paying the taxi fare. _I could not recall what the taxi driver has actually said that triggered my anger. Due to that, I started to scold him and also used vulgarities against him._ I also said that I would call for police to come over as we cannot come to any agreement.

> \[emphasis added\]

66     During the accused’s evidence-in-chief (outlined above at \[19\] – \[21\]), he gave a different account of the sequence of transactions made and offered in payment of the taxi fare. The accused stated that upon arrival opposite Fajar Shopping Centre, he realised that he only had $32 in cash which would be insufficient to make payment for the taxi fare which amounted to $39. Thus, the accused first offered to go and retrieve money from 440 Fajar Road, and then offered to leave his wallet, phone and NRIC in the taxi while he retrieved money, which was met with an accusation from PW1 that “I see your face and I know you will run…” The accused’s account in court was that he subsequently offered to pay the fare with Hong Kong dollars, but the offer was refused. The accused then passed to PW1 a POSB ATM card but after one to two minutes, was met with a response that “Your card could not be used, I see your face, I know that you would run away.”[^134]

67     The accused also did not mention in P11 that he subsequently suggested proceeding to a nearby ATM to withdraw money, or that the offer was refused by PW1. Contrary to the accused’s account in court that PW1’s repeated rejections of his suggested payment modes resulted in frustration on his part, resulting in his decision to make a grab for the in-car camera, the version in P11 was that the accused could not remember what triggered his anger. The accused also made no mention that he had offered to make payment in Hong Kong dollars in P11. His account that he had to go to his sister’s place in his statement to retrieve money, was also materially different from his account in evidence-in-chief that he had to retrieve money from his own home at level 2 of Blk 440.[^135]

68     During cross-examination, the accused was given the opportunity to explain why the accused’s recollection of events in court differed from his account in P11, some years after the incident. The accused’s explanation was that there were inaccuracies in his statement, and that he had mentioned his version of the dispute with PW1 but the same was not recorded by the recording officer,[^136] was squarely disputed by PW8, Station Inspector Nye Boon Chun, who recorded the accused’s statement, in rebuttal.[^137] These included the sequence of offered payments to PW1 for the fare as stated by the accused in court.[^138]

69     The accused was also cross-examined regarding why he had requested to proceed to Fajar Road when his residential address at the time was in Jurong West. The accused initially explained that as he stayed in China for long periods of time for work, when he returned to Singapore, he would stay at his sister’s residence at Fajar Road as he did at the material time.[^139] The accused’s explanation for why he had referred during the trial to the second floor unit at Blk 440 Fajar Road as his own residence rather than his sister’s residence, was due to the fact that he had since become the owner of the unit that his sister resided in at the material time.[^140] When it was suggested that the accused’s sister’s address was in actual fact Blk 124 Pending Road at the material time, the accused then promptly stated that Blk 440 Fajar Road was the residence of the younger sister of his ex-wife[^141] and proceeded to raise issue, somewhat irrelevantly to the question posed, with the lack of CCTV footage to verify his account.[^142]. When the accused was required to explain why he had stated he was going to his sister’s place rather than his ex-wife’s sister’s residence in P11, the accused then provided a somewhat contrived explanation, for the very first time, “\[f\]or 20 over years, I address her as younger sister”.[^143] There was not an iota of evidence adduced by the defence to substantiate the belated assertion that the sister of the accused’s ex-wife resided at Blk 440 Fajar Road, and that the accused was indeed residing with her at the material time.

70     The prosecution suggested that the accused’s credibility in P11 was also in question, and that he had never suggested to PW1 that he could go to his sister’s place to retrieve money, or that he would leave his personal belongings in the vehicle while he went to retrieve money.[^144] P11 was admitted in evidence at the instance of the prosecution for the purpose of cross-examination of the accused. P11’s probative value chiefly related to the veracity of the accused’s account in court, particularly due to the multitude of discrepancies between P11, an account given by the accused with greater contemporaneity with the events at the material time, and the accused’s version in court. In my view, it was possible that the accused was just as inclined to be economical with the truth in P11 as he was in court, in view of the various discrepancies between the two accounts.

71     I turn now to address the accused’s evidence in court that PW8 had inaccurately recorded his statement, P11. If it was indeed true that the accused had given a detailed account of all the various modes of payment offered, including an offer to withdraw cash from a nearby ATM, it would be puzzling that PW8 would selectively record that the accused had handed over a POSB card, and when informed that payment was not successful, that the accused made an offer to go to the accused’s “sister’s” place to retrieve money, and not any of the other suggestions for payment of the taxi fare. In fact, the accused’s account that PW1 had rejected all the offered payment modes and accused him as being the type of passenger who would run away ought to have been mentioned in P11, if such an account was truthful, and in the absence of any suggestion that PW8 might have reason to be selective in recording the accused’s account.[^145]

#### (ii)   The accused’s evidence differed in certain respects from the case put by counsel for the defence on his behalf to the prosecution witnesses

72     As the trial proceeded, aspects of the accused’s evidence stood in contrast to the case put to PW1 by counsel for the defence, which suggested that the accused’s defence evolved as he contrived explanations in the course of the trial.

73     First, defence counsel put to PW1 that the address which the accused instructed PW1 to drive to was Blk 446, Fajar Road rather than 440 Fajar Road, a discrepancy which the accused did not account for under questioning.[^146] Under re-examination, the accused was given ample opportunity to explain the discrepancy, and even then he failed to maintain a consistent account, relating to the destination stated:[^147]

> Q    Okay. Okay. My last question. This actually goes all the way back to the very start. Also, likewise, my put question, I stated that you had told the taxi driver to go specifically to Block 446. But in your EIC, it was 440 and you are very certain, this is 440. So, just giving you a chance now if you want to explain.

> A    The thing that I said is 440. Probably, it was a misunderstanding because of the---the person who has heard it wrongly. _I told my lawyer, it’s 440_. Maybe, someone may have misheard. Then, the taxi stopped by the roadside_. It’s the easiest to state 446 because 446 is the address just at the roadside._ If I did not tell him to drive me to 440, ho---how would he be able to search under such difficult circumstances and be able to locate and be---just downstairs?

> \[emphasis added\]

74     Secondly, counsel for the accused put to PW1 that PW1 had spoken in a mixture of Mandarin and Hokkien (_cf_ \[19\] above), in particular, the statement that “I see your face and I know you will run. I see a lot of customers like you.”[^148] During his evidence in chief and re-examination, PW1 maintained that he did not know how to speak in Hokkien.[^149] When the accused was under cross-examination, the accused’s testimony differed from the case put by his counsel, as he stated that PW1 had spoken in Mandarin and that it was the accused who spoke in a mixture of Mandarin and Hokkien.[^150]

75     During the accused’s cross-examination, the prosecution put to the accused that the accused had changed his evidence on the language used by PW1 since his evidence differed from the case put by counsel to PW1.[^151] Read in context, the accused’s response under cross-examination could be regarded as deliberately evasive, although the responses could also possibly suggest that he had misunderstood the prosecution’s suggestions. This is because the accused’s answers were to the effect that there were communication issues during the recording of his statement and that all Singaporeans speak in a mixture of languages including Hokkien, but the accused did not explain why his account of the language used by PW1 differed under the accused’s cross-examination from the case put to PW1 by counsel for the accused.[^152] When given the opportunity to clarify his evidence in re-examination, the accused curiously switched his account, to state that PW1 had spoken in a mixture of Mandarin and Hokkien:[^153]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Okay. Now, there is also this issue about the language---language that the taxi driver had used to scold you, alright? Because in my put question, I had stated that it was in a mix of Hokkien and Mandarin. But---

 |
| 

Wee:

 | 

Sorry, Ma’am.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But in your EIC, you had stated that it was only in Mandarin. So, now during Re-Examination, I’m giving you a chance if you want to try to explain this position.

 |
| 

A

 | 

When I spoke to him, it was a mix of Chinese and Hokkien. Sometimes in English because “uncle”, this word is English. When he replied, it’s in Chinese_. That’s---so, he mixed in some English and Hokkien because Singaporeans speak like this in a rojak kind of language._ Don’t tell me that he doesn’t even know one word in Hokkien, I---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

A

 | 

wouldn’t---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So,---

 |
| 

A

 | 

believe.

 |
| 

Wee:

 | 

Sorry, Ma’am.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. So, that’s your final answer? Okay. So, am I right to say that the---you said, with a mix or add in, so the majority of the language that he had replied you in is Mandarin, correct? Okay.

 |
| 

A

 | 

The majority is in Chinese.

 |
| 

\[emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

76     While the accused’s explanation under cross-examination for the change in position relating to the language used by PW1 could possibly have been attributed to a misunderstanding of the questions posed by the prosecution, the accused’s answers under re-examination suggested that he had very clearly understood counsel’s questions. The accused had chosen to adopt a different position when given the opportunity to explain. As such, I accepted the prosecution’s submission that the accused was changing his evidence as an afterthought.

#### (iii)   The accused’s account of PW1’s reactions to the accused’s suggestions for payment of the fare is illogical

77     The evolving nature of the accused’s evidence can also be seen from other aspects of his evidence in court. It emerged for the very first time under the accused’s cross-examination, that he had not in fact said to PW1 that “I will play with you to until the end”, but had in fact said that he would _pay_ PW1 until the end, or that he had said he wanted to pay PW1 completely.[^154] This alleged statement was never put to PW1 by the defence as part of his case. PW1 was never confronted with the accused’s version of the words used on PW1, so that PW1 may agree or disagree with the accused’s account.

78     The accused’s belated claim appeared to have been made to buttress the accused’s defence that he had felt compelled to make a grab for the in-car camera footage as “evidence” that all his attempts to pay PW1 were either unsuccessful or unreasonably refused. The accused’s account also appeared to have been an afterthought designed to downplay his aggression towards PW1, and at odds with the undisputed fact that PW1 had seen the need to not only step out of the taxi to phone the police, but also to stand some 20 to 25 meters away from the taxi. The accused’s allegation that PW1 had sought to prevent the accused from leaving the taxi after PW1 rejected all the modes of payment proposed by the accused was also most curious given the distance that PW1 kept from the taxi and that the accused had in fact managed to enter the driver’s seat of the taxi.

79     The accused’s account would also make little sense in light of PW1’s contemporaneous reaction as evidenced in the first information report, P1, which recorded the text of message “Passenger causing me a lot of problem (Commotion)”, from PW1’s phone call to the police. The text recorded would also appear to contradict the accused’s account that all he sought to do was suggest that a police report be made to seek assistance to resolve the issues relating to payment of the taxi fare with PW1.

80     On the other hand, the accused’s account of PW1’s responses to him during the exchange in the taxi relating to the payment of the taxi fare appeared illogical. For instance, the accused claimed that he had assured PW1 when the latter said “I look at the face, I knew that you are those kind of customers who were run away”, by volunteering to leave his handphone, wallet and NRIC in the taxi.[^155] It seemed quite improbable that despite such an offer, PW1’s response would be to conclude that the accused wanted to run away, since the offer to leave the accused’s personal items was made presumably to assure PW1 of precisely the opposite.

#### (iv)   The accused’s account of the snatching of the in-car camera footage was lacking in details and raised belatedly

81     The accused’s account of snatching the “CCTV” which he later clarified referred to the in-car camera, _ie_, that there was “a period of snatching back and forth”[^156] and that “there must have been some kind of knocking physically”[^157] was also rather lacking in details or description which made it difficult to understand how it might have been possible for the damage to the interior of the taxi and injuries to PW1. Under cross-examination, the accused was specifically asked to provide details of the “back and forth”, and the elaboration provided remained bereft of details:[^158]

> Q    So, when you said that there was snatching back and forth of the camera, correct, and there was some knocking which the---

> A    Okay. So, that was what happened after the pra---previous payment---unsucc---unsuccessful payment transaction, so that was after that. I started to become a bit angry and I wanted to snatch the in-car camera. So, when---one-hand, I was snatching. The other hand, I knocked over it.

> Q    So, which hand were you snatching the in-car camera with that day?

> A    Right hand.

> Q    And you said, “The other hand, I knocked over it.” So, this other hand firstly is your left hand?

> A    Sorry, I wish to rectify that.

> Interpreter:    Now, the witness is saying, “While my right hand was trying to snatch the in-car camera, the driver used his---one of his hands to knock off---knock away my hand to prevent me from snatching the in-car camera.”

> Q    Alright. And when the driver was---used his hand to knock on your hand, this is the right hand, correct, that he knocked?

> A    I’m not too sure whether it’s right hand or left hand but I used my right hand to snatch.

> Q    Alright. So, after this you trying to snatch the camera with your right hand and the taxi driver knocking your hand to prevent you from snatching it, you mentioned that there was some back and forth, correct? You mentioned earlier.

> A    Yes.

> _Q_      _Can you describe this back and forth for us? What happened? What---who---who did what?_

> _A_      _When he knocked away my hand I used a greater force using both of my hands to try and snatch the in-car camera. And he also wanted to snatch back. After about 10 over seconds the in-car camera dropped. I don’t know it dropped to which location._

> \[emphasis added\]

82     Even by the accused’s own account in court, it is difficult to understand how the back and forth of snatching as described, could have resulted in the extent of damage depicted in the photographs to the mobile data terminal, rear view mirror and the NETS machine.[^159] This version of events would also in no way explain the damage to the front passenger window of the taxi. More importantly, this account would fail to explain how the mobile phone stand, which was to the right of the driver’s seat, attached to the front windscreen, had been detached from the windscreen. This is because according to the accused, he had inserted himself between the driver’s seat and front, so as to grab the in-car camera footage, and in doing so struggled with PW1.[^160]

83     The court also accepted the prosecution’s closing submissions, that if was indeed true that the “struggle” for the in-car camera lasted for about 10 seconds as the accused had stated,[^161] the extensive damage to the interior of the taxi, including to the NETS machine, the mobile data terminal and also the rear view mirror would appear to be a rather unlikely result. It would be rather bizarre for the wires to be in the state as depicted in P2-14 and P2-18.[^162] When provided the opportunity to explain, the accused’s explanation lacked consistency, as the accused first suggested that PW1 might have inflicted the damage on his own, before proffering the possibility of damage in the course of a struggle:[^163]

> Q    I put it to you, Mr. Teo, that as the mobile data terminal and NETS machine are at the dashboard and far away from the in-car camera at the top of the taxi, there is no reason for you to damage the NETS machine and mobile data terminal if you’re just grabbing the in-car camera. Agree or disagree?

> A    Probably it might be damaged by the taxi hims---taxi driver himself.

> Q    So, you are saying, Mr. Teo, that the taxi driver had---may have damaged the mobile data terminal and NETS machine. That’s what you’re telling us, can I confirm?

> A    There’s a possibility. _Because I---I did not look at what’s happening to the car after that. You said that it’s far away, so probably it might have been done by him._

> Q    Mr. Teo, I put it to you that the taxi driver, Mr. Chan, had no reason to damage the mobile data terminal and NETS machine in his own taxi. Agree or disagree?

> A     _I don’t know. Maybe he wanted to take revenge._

> Q    I put it to you, Mr. Teo, that this allegation that the taxi driver had damaged the mobile data terminal and NETS machine of his own taxi is an afterthought. Agree or disagree?

> A    I said I don’t know. It is not something that I added after that. I just said there’s a possibility. You meant to say that---that---there’s a distance. _I already admitted that it’s damaged by me, and now you still asking. In the course of the struggle, I said I might have damaged._

> Q    I put it to you, Mr. Teo, that if you were trying to grab---I retra---I rephrase that put. I put it to you, Mr. Teo, that if as you claim there was a struggle in trying to grab the in-car camera at the top of the taxi, there is no reason for the MDT and the NETS machine at the dashboard to be damaged. Agree or disagree?

> A    In the course of the struggle and the snatching, there’s the possibility of damaging items.

> \[emphasis added\]

84     As far as the injuries to PW1 went, PW2 testified that the injuries sustained by PW1 were not inconsistent with the account of a back and forth snatching. That said, I note that in the questions put to PW2, little information was provided to PW2 in relation to the relative position of items within the taxi, and also the sequence of events. More importantly, if PW1’s interactions with the accused were perceived to be rude and upsetting, prompting a need to seize the in-car camera as evidence of PW1’s conduct, it should be rather surprising that the accused made no mention of this at all in P11.[^164] When required to explain why he did not mention the crucial aspects of his interaction with PW1 in the taxi in P11, the accused stated that he had been drunk and so he could not remember everything that was said. When the prosecution pressed the accused on why he was then able to remember at the trial more than two years after the incident, the accused then stated that he had in fact informed the statement recorder who did not record the upsetting “Looking at your face, you would want to run” utterance by PW1 in his statement, which PW8 contradicted.

85     The accused’s assertion that he had mentioned the snatching of the in-car camera to the recording officer,[^165] and the exchange between PW1 and the accused that upset him,[^166] though this account was firmly contradicted by the recorder, PW8, in rebuttal.[^167] It was only under re-examination that the accused first raised that he had mentioned in P11 that there was no fight, only because PW8 told him that the snatching of the in-car camera did not constitute a fight, an allegation denied by PW8.[^168] On the contrary, PW8’s account[^169] made ample sense in the context of P11, as the accused had in fact mentioned that he had sustained injuries on his hands in P11, and the accused had also in fact admitted to injuring his own hands in the course of trying to damage the taxi:

> Q    Alright. I’ll now direct your attention to question 1 on page 2. There you ask the accused, “Are you able to recall that was there any fight took place?” And the accused answered, “I’m sure there was no fight took place during the incident.” Can you tell us, what led you to ask this question from the accused that day when you recorded his statement?

> _A_      _Your Honour, during the interview with the accused person, I notice there’s some bruises on his hand, that led me to put this question to him._

> Q    Was there any discussion of any struggle by yourself or the accused when you were asking this particular question?

> A    No, Your Honour.

> \[emphasis added\]

86     The prosecution also confronted the accused on why he would be found in the driver’s seat, if it was indeed true that he was at the backseat during the “back and forth” that he described. The accused only stated under cross-examination (and not before), that he had entered the driver’s seat in search of the in car camera.[^170] If his account was truthful, one would expect that he would have located the in-car camera at the scene and informed the police,[^171] instead of querying whether the footage was available subsequently. The stated intention of the accused also did not appear consistent with the observed demeanour of the accused as seen by the first responding officers PW3 and PW4, specifically, that he appeared to be drunk and rowdy at the time that they arrived at the scene.

### D   Conclusion in relation to the VCH Charge and the Mischief Charge

87     In the light of the evidence, the court found that the prosecution had proven both the VCH Charge and the Mischief Charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted the accused on both charges. Essentially, PW1’s account was unusually convincing given its consistency internally and externally in material aspects, and the evidence put forward by the accused was found to lack the requisite credibility so as to raise a reasonable doubt.

88     Following the pronouncement of the accused’s conviction on the two charges, he pleaded guilty to the LCA Charge, _viz_, of being drunk at incapable of taking care of himself at the material date and time, in the vicinity of Fajar Road Shopping Centre under s 14(1) of the Liquor Control Act, on which he was convicted. The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification.

## Decision on sentence

89     In relation to the sentence for the VCH Charge, the prosecution submitted that there were various aggravating factors, including that the victim, PW1, was a public transport worker and that assaults on public transport workers merited deterrence. The prosecution submitted that assaults of public transport workers merited a benchmark imprisonment term of 4 weeks’ imprisonment as established in the case of _Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span> (“_Wong Hoi Len_”). Given that the accused did not exhibit remorse, was voluntarily intoxicated, and had inflicted violence gratuitously using an implement, _ie_, the mobile phone stand, the prosecution submitted that an uplift of one to two weeks’ imprisonment was warranted. The prosecution also highlighted that there were also no mitigating factors such as restitution made in relation to the VCH Charge, though it was accepted that the accused had borne the full cost of making repairs to the taxi. That said, the uplift sought was limited to two weeks’ imprisonment as the harm caused was not serious. In relation to the Mischief Charge, the prosecution submitted that an imprisonment term of one week was appropriate.

90     The prosecution highlighted the accused’s antecedent in 2001 for rioting and in 2012 for drink driving, but did not urge the court to place weight on the rioting antecedent given that the prosecution recognised that the antecedent was dated.

91     The defence also submitted that the accused was remorseful for his actions and had paid the repair cost for the taxi at an early juncture. Counsel for the accused urged the court to consider that Covid-19 measures have affected the accused’s work, and that a term of imprisonment may result in the loss of his job and livelihood.

92     Having considered the respective submissions on sentence, the court imposed five weeks’ imprisonment for the VCH Charge and 1 week’s imprisonment for the Mischief Charge, to run consecutively given the differing legally protected interests invaded (bodily integrity and property) respectively. I agreed that the assault of a public transport worker should be met with a strong message of deterrence. In addition, I agreed in particular with the prosecution’s submission that the use of an implement, in this case, the mobile phone stand which the accused pulled out from the taxi, was an aggravating factor. This is because the use of an implement in an assault was with a view to inflicting hurt of a degree that would tend to be more significant than if an implement was not used at all. The culpability of the accused was therefore increased by virtue of the use of an implement, hence justifying the uplift by one week’s imprisonment, above the benchmark sentence in _Wong Hoi Len._ For the reasons I have given, in my view, five weeks’ imprisonment was an appropriate sentence on the facts.

93     In relation to the Mischief Charge, the court took into account the extensive damage to the taxi, which resulted in the taxi being out of operation for a number of days, which impacted upon PW1’s livelihood as a taxi driver. The prosecution urged the court to consider _PP v Chiang Kok Wee_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 36</span> (“_Chiang Kok Wee_”), where damage was inflicted by the offender to a car by kicking and punching the victim’s car door, causing it damage in excess of $500 ($6883.63). In _Chiang Kok Wee_, the damage was inflicted in the backdrop of “road rage”, that is to say that the offence was committed in the course of a road use dispute. The offender in _Chiang Kok Wee_ was sentenced to a fine of two weeks’ imprisonment. The offender was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $4,000, for an offence under s 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed), for using abusive words with intent to cause alarm to another person.

94     As the prosecution reasonably recognised that the damage caused to the vehicle in _Chiang Kok Wee_ was more extensive than in the present case, the prosecution submitted that one week’s imprisonment would be appropriate. I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the damage inflicted on the taxi was the key factor in sentencing, and the damage was not insignificant in this case. I also took into account that the accused’s culpability was on the overall, moderate. The accused’s acts of inflicting damage on the taxi were in my view, protracted and deliberate, as part of a sustained reaction to the situation that the accused regarded frustrating, _ie_, the dispute with PW1 over the payment of the taxi fare. This can be seen from the number of damaged items, including the front left passenger window, NETS machine, mobile data terminal and the rear view mirror. That said, in my view, it was correct for the prosecution to have refrained from a submission that the court should also consider aggravating voluntarily intoxication and that the offence was committed against a public transport worker in sentencing for the Mischief Charge, because to do so would amount to counting of the same aggravating factors twice over.

95     As for the LCA Charge, in my view, two days’ imprisonment was appropriate in view of the relative gravity of the offence, ordered to run concurrently with the imprisonment terms for the VCH Charge and the Mischief Charge, in view of the totality of the offending. In totality, the accused’s offending essentially took the form of infliction of bodily hurt and property damage arising out of the use of public transport operated by PW1. As I had already taken into account the accused’s voluntary intoxication in calibrating the individual sentence for the VCH Charge, it would be appropriate to run the sentence for the LCA Charge concurrently with the remaining imprisonment terms. Taking a step back and one last look at the overall sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment, it was my view that the overall sentence was appropriate in light of the accused’s overall criminality.

## Conclusion

96     In light of the foregoing, the accused was convicted on a total of three charges, and sentenced in the aggregate to six weeks’ imprisonment. In view of the prosecution’s position that the available documentation insufficiently indicated the cost of medical treatment arising out of the offence committed, no order of compensation was made. In view of the accused’s appeal against conviction and sentence, bail pending appeal was granted. The accused is presently on bail.
