### District Judge Sarah Tan:

## Introduction

1       The Accused is Lu Shun, male, Chinese national, 36 years old at the time of the offence. He faced a single charge, MAC-902845-2019, in respect of an offence under Section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”). He was unrepresented.

2       He claimed trial. I convicted him on the said charge. The Accused was sentenced to 12 days’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licenses for a period of 20 months with effect from the date of release.

3       The Accused filed an appeal against the conviction and the sentence. A stay on the execution of the sentence has been granted and the Accused is out on bail pending the appeal in the sum of $15,000.

## Charge and Sentence

5       The Accused was sentenced to 12 days’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licenses for a period of 20 months with effect from the date of release.

## Prosecution’s Case for the Trial

6       On 30 November 2018, at about 4.10 pm, Mr Samynathan Balakrishnan (the “Victim”) was riding along the Kranji Expressway towards the direction of Bukit Timah Expressway, on his motorcycle bearing registration number FBD361M (the “Victim’s Motorcycle”).

7       A motor van bearing registration number GBH4291J (the “Accused’s Van”), driven by the Accused, collided with the Victim’s Motorcycle.

8       It was the Prosecution’s case that the collision occurred, and the Victim’s injuries resulted, because of the Accused’s negligence: the Accused was filtering into the slip road of Sungei Tengah Road and had failed to keep a proper lookout when doing so.

9       The Prosecution called a total of 6 witnesses. They were:

> (a)     PW1: the Victim himself;

> (b)     PW2: Mr Pubalan s/o Subramaniam (“Mr Pubalan”), a fellow motorist at the scene at material time;

> (c)     PW3: Station Inspector Thabagesh Jeyathesh (“SI Thabagesh”);

> (d)     PW4: Senior Staff Sergeant Rafael Tan Soon Peng (“SSS Rafael”);

> (e)     PW5: Corporal Rio Agus Bin Salim (“Corporal Rio”); and

> (f)     PW6: Station Inspector Norashikin Daud (“SI Norashikin”)

10     SSS Rafael testified that he arrived at the site after the accident and the road conditions and weather conditions that day were fine, and the traffic volume was moderate.

11     The Victim testified that the Accused had made a left turn somewhere in the middle of the chevron marking, without slowing down or switching on the left signal light. [^1]

12     Mr Pubalan largely corroborated the Victim’s evidence. He testified that the Victim’s Motorcycle was in front of him in the same lane, and the Accused’s Van, which was initially nowhere near them, [^2] had cut in straight in front of him from his right, while he was before the start of the chevron marking and the Victim was already halfway in the chevron. [^3]

13     The Victim was flung upon impact and sustained various fractures. Therefore, the Accused had caused grievous hurt to the Victim by doing an act so negligently as to endanger human life.

## Accused’s Case for the Trial

14     The Accused conducted his own defence. He did not dispute that he was filtering left to the slip road. The gist of the Defence was that he had done so in good time before the chevron marking. He braked and slowed down, and had kept a lookout by checking his left side and rear-view mirror. He had also switched on his left signal light. The Accused contended that it was the Victim who was trying to overtake him and drove straight into him. The Accused did not dispute that there was a collision and the Victim suffered the injuries stated in the medical reports. [^4]

## Issued to be determined

15     The issues to be determined were as follows:

> (a)     Whether the Accused failed to keep a proper lookout when filtering into the slip road?

> (b)     Whether the Victim suffered grievous hurt?

> (c)     Whether the Accused committed an act so negligently as to endanger human life?

## Findings for the Trial

16     My findings for the Trial are set out below.

### Issue 1: Whether the Accused failed to keep a proper lookout when filtering into the slip road?

17     I examined the circumstances of the accident.

#### The scene and conditions

18     At the time of the accident, SSS Rafael was a Staff Sergeant attached to the Traffic Police and patrolled the streets, conducted traffic enforcement and attended to traffic incidents. In his seven years with the Traffic Police, he had attended to thousands of road traffic accidents.

19     On 30 November 2018 at about 4.10 pm, SSS Rafael was dispatched by the control centre as the first responding officer to the accident. He testified that it was a hot and sunny day and the road surface was dry. Traffic volume was moderate, and visibility was clear.

20     SSS Raphael described the accident scene as a four-lane expressway, with a slip road to the left into Sungei Tengah Road. When he arrived, the Accused’s Van was on the Chevron marking and the Victim’s Motorcycle was on the left road shoulder. He prepared the “First Police Officer’s Accident Report”. [^5]

21     His evidence was not challenged by the Accused.

22     During this trial, parties adopted the naming convention of referring to the slip road as Lane 1, and the next lanes from the left to right as Lanes 2 to 5.

#### The filtering to the left by the Accused: The evidence of the Victim

23     The Victim testified that he has been a holder of a Class 2 and Class 3 driving licence for more than 30 years. He testified that in the afternoon of 30 November 2018, he was riding the Victim’s Motorcycle, on his way home, travelling at about 70 to 80 kilometres per hour.

24     The Victim testified that the other vehicle, the Accused’s Van, was “trying to make a turn” [^6]. This left turn was made somewhere in the middle of the chevron marking, past the start of the chevron marking. [^7]

25     He testified during cross-examination that the left signal light and brake lights of the Accused’s Van were not turned on. [^8]

#### The filtering to the left by the Accused: The evidence of the Accused

26     The Accused did not deny that he was turning left. He testified that he was in Lane 2 and was filtering left Lane 1:

> “…when I was driving at the start of the chevron marking, about 100 metres---150 metres, I turned on my signal light, the left signal light, and then I started to decelerate. I stepped on my brakes. I did not immediately---I did not immediately make a turn. I take a look at my left and my right, and then I…At first glance, I did not see anything, and then I stretched my head out a little, I looked at the---I look at the left side and behind, I don’t see anything. I was travelling at around 60, I wasn’t speeding. And then I looked twice, there was no one. I was already at the chevron marking---the start of the chevron marking. So, from there, I made a left turn, and then the \[Victim’s Motorcycle\] collided onto my vehicle…And then I was on the right side, in the middle of the chevron marking, I stopped there.” [^9]

27     Thus, the Accused’s position was that he had done the filtering in good time and with the necessary preparation and caution. It was the Victim who ploughed straight into him.

28     I found that the Victim’s version was corroborated by the evidence of Mr Pubalan.

#### The filtering to the left by the Accused: The evidence of Mr Pubalan

29     Mr Pubalan testified that 30 November 2018 at about 4 pm, he was driving his tow truck along Kranji Expressway, heading to Marina Bay Sands. He described that he was on Lane 2 at material time, and the Victim, on the Victim’s Motorcycle, was ahead of him. [^10]

30     Mr Pubalan then testified that the Accused’s Van then cut across in front of him, hitting the Victim. [^11]

31     I noted from Mr Pubalan’s earlier evidence that the Accused’s Van had not been in the same lane as the Victim and Mr Pubalan. Mr Pubalan, like the Victim, could not quite pinpoint where the Accused’s Van came from before the collision, [^12] although he believed that the Accused’s Van came from Lane 4. [^13]

32     What Mr Pubalan was clear about was that the Victim’s motorcycle was in front of him, and that “\[the Accused’s Van\] was not near---anywhere near \[them\]”, [^14] and that the Accused’s Van had cut in straight in front of him from his right, while he was at Lane 2 before the start of the chevron marking and the Victim was in the same Lane 2 and already halfway in the chevron. [^15]

33     He estimated that he was travelling at about 50 to 55 kilometres per hour, as he was towing a vehicle, while the Victim would be travelling at about 60 kilometres per hour. His evidence was that the Accused’s Van was speeding and had come in front of him and knocked the Victim very quickly. [^16] Unfortunately, Mr Pubalan’s in-car camera footage was not available as his jam brake at the time of the incident had caused the mounting to come out. [^17]

34     Mr Pubalan candidly admitted that he could not remember if the Accused’s Van’s signal lights were turned on.

35     The Accused did not challenge Mr Pubalan’s evidence in cross-examination. The Accused merely asked Mr Pubalan if the “X” Mr Pubalan had marked on exhibit P4 was his evidence as to where the Accused had collided into the Victim’s Motorcycle, to which the Mr Pubalan answered in the affirmative. The Accused did not challenge him further, to contest Mr Pubalan’s assertion that the Accused had tried to make his left turn after the start of the chevron marking, after the tip.

#### The filtering to the left by the Accused: The evidence of Corporal Rio and the Vehicle Damage Reports

36     At material time, Corporal Rio was an auxiliary police officer attached to LTA Traffic Marshal. He was activated to attend to the accident and handled the on-scene investigation. He did the sketch plan [^18] and the Vehicle Damage Reports of the Victim’s Motorcycle and the Accused’s Van. [^19]

37     Corporal Rio testified that, looking at the three documents he prepared, namely, the sketch plan and the two Vehicle Damage Reports [^20], his assessment was that the accident was caused by the Accused’s Van doing a last-minute exit from the expressway, via the slip road on the left side headed towards Sungei Tengah. [^21] However, given that the Accused’s Van had been shifted by the time he arrived [^22], Corporal Rio admitted that he could not tell where the point of collision was. [^23]

38     I was prepared to accept that the Vehicle Damage Reports indicated a collision between the Victim’s Motorcycle heading straight, and the Accused’s Van turning left. However, the Vehicle Damage Reports did not quite shed light on whether the Victim’s account of events or the Accused’s account of events (in particular, as to the timing of the Accused’s left turn) was to be preferred.

#### The alleged over-taking by the Victim

39     The Accused had asserted that he executed his turn at the start of the chevron marking:

> “… I was already at the chevron marking---the start of the chevron marking. So, from there, I made a left turn, and then the \[Victim’s Motorcycle\] collided onto my vehicle…And then I was on the right side, in the middle of the chevron marking, I stopped there.” [^24]

40     However, he had also testified that the Victim had tried to overtake him on the chevron marking:

> “A:    … I kept confirming with the witness, he said that he did not see me step on the brakes or turn on the signal light, which meant that he overtook me on the chevron marking.” [^25]

> “A:    …And what’s more important was that he was on my left side, on the chevron marking, he tried to overturn---overtake me…” [^26]

41     It was very telling that by the Accused’s own evidence, the Victim was allegedly overtaking the Accused on his left “on the chevron marking”. If the Victim was in the position to overtake the Accused on his left “on the chevron marking”, then by this Accused’s evidence, the irresistible inference would be that:

> (a)     the Accused’s Van had not completed its filtering to the slip road by the start of the chevron marking, and/or

> (b)     the Accused’s Van was doing its filtering to the slip road by cutting across the chevron marking.

42     Even the Accused’s own evidence would not be discordant with the version put forth by the Victim and Mr Pubalan, that the Accused tried to change lanes last minute, after the start of the chevron marking.

#### The nature of the Accused’s work as a delivery man and his delivery that day

43     In cross-examination, the Accused admitted that he was a delivery man and at material time he was driving on Kranji Expressway towards Bukit Timah Expressway, heading to Choa Chu Kang. It was a route that he was not familiar with, and he relied on GPS instructions to take the Brickland exit towards Sungei Tengah to get to his destination on time. Indeed, the Accused indicated that if he missed the Brickland exit, he would have to change to another route, but he was not sure of the alternative route. [^27] This pointed again to his unfamiliarity with the route.

44     The Accused admitted that he needed to take the exit before he missed it, and he was focused on not missing his exit. [^28]

#### The failure to keep a proper lookout

45     During cross-examination, the Accused testified that while he was making the turn, his vision was not obscured in any way. [^29] However, he did not see the Victim’s Motorcycle because “the left corner of \[the Accused’s Van\] has a blind spot…Because the 2 sides of \[the Accused’s Van\], the windows, they are all sealed, so \[he was\] not able to see anything”. [^30]

46     At first, he asserted that he had checked the blind spot but did not see the Victim’s motorcycle. [^31]. However, he subsequently admitted that because the windows of his van were sealed, he could not have checked his blind spot. [^32] The Accused testified that:

> “the left---the---the windows at the side are sealed, so I have to rely on the side mirror. So, I can only look at the rear depend---relying on this side mirror”. [^33]

47     He added that he checked the mirror in the middle of the Accused’s Van.

48     However, it was clear from the evidence that the Accused had not checked his blind spot, because his view was blocked by the covering over the windows:

> “A:    There is a mirror in the middle---in the ca---in the middle of the car, then you can see, you can check, but there wasn’t nothing---but there was nothing, and then I looked at the left side mirror, and I could not see anything. Because in the van there is---there is a blind spot at the rear left side. Unless I turn my vehicle to the left and to the right, then I will be able to see.

> Q:    Okay, so there is a blind spot at the rear left side of your vehicle that you couldn’t check?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And because you couldn’t check, you didn’t check?

> A:    It’s not that I did not check, but I was not able to see.

> Q:    So, essentially, what you are saying is that, you didn’t check your blind spot because you couldn’t check your blind spot before you made the turn?

> A:    Correct.

> …

> Q:    …So, if you could check your blind spot, you would have seen the motorcycle?

> A:    Correct.

> Q:    And you failed to check your blind spot because you couldn’t check your blind spot?

> A:    Also correct.” [^34]

49     The Accused conceded, once again, in his Submissions that “\[he\] did not see PW1 as he was at my blind spot”. [^35]

50     Rule 88 of the Highway Code requires drivers, in executing a turn, to do the following:

> “88.  Well before you change directions, overtake or stop –

>> (a)    Look into your mirror (if you are a motor-cyclist to the side or behind);

>> (b)    Make sure that it is safe; and

>> (c)    Give a clear signal to indicate that you intend to do so.”

51     It was clear from the Accused’s evidence that:

> (a)     the Accused’s Van had a blind spot;

> (b)     the Accused could not check the blind spot as his windows were covered up;

> (c)     the Accused did nothing further to check his blind spot, to ensure that it was safe before turning; and

> (d)     the Accused failed to check his blind spot and to ensure it was safe before turning, falling below the requisite objective standard of the reasonable person.

52     The totality of the evidence painted a picture of the Accused facing unfamiliarity and time constraints in making deliveries, conscious of getting to his destination on time by taking the most efficient route. In his rush to get off the expressway as guided by his GPS and make it for the Brickland exit, he had made a last-minute attempt to get onto the Lane 1 slip road. He did not check his blind spot. He did nothing further to address the blind spot and to ensure it was safe before turning. The Accused had thus failed to keep a proper lookout when filtering.

### Issue 2: Whether the Victim suffered grievous hurt?

53     It was not disputed that there was indeed a collision between the Accused’s Van and the Victim’s Motorcycle. The Victim ultimately landed on the road.

54     After the accident, the Victim was examined by Dr Daniel Lee.

55     SI Norashikin had applied for the Victim’s medical reports when she was still the investigation officer for the case. At the outset of the trial, the following medical reports were interpreted to the Accused, and he confirmed that he had no objections to the admission of these medical reports, and did not wish to question the doctors:

> (a)     Medical report dated 4 April 2019, prepared by Dr Lock Jing Zhan [^36];

> (b)     Medical report dated 16 April 2019 prepared by Dr Jonathan Low Chee Chung [^37]; and

> (c)     Medical reports dated 5 August 2019 and 13 February 2020 prepared by Dr Daniel Lee [^38].

56     These medical reports were admitted through SI Thabagesh.

57     The Accused’s questions to SI Thabagesh centred largely on why it took so long (some six months) after the Victim was discharged on 7 December 2018, to get the medical reports. SI Thabagesh replied that he was not able to answer as the preparation and endorsement of the medical reports were done by the hospital.

58     The Victim was diagnosed to have sustained posterior fractures to his right 4th to 6th ribs, anterior fractures to his right 6th to 7th ribs, and fractures to his bilateral anterior skull/orbital roof, right lateral maxillary wall, and nasal bone. He was warded from 30 November 2018 to 7 December 2018. [^39] There were no permanent injuries. [^40]

59     The Accused alleged that the Victim had not secured his helmet properly and it had come off in the aftermath of the collision. [^41] However, this was not put to the Victim and the other witnesses.

60     “Grievous hurt” is defined at Section 320 of the Penal Code, and includes “fracture or dislocation of a bone”.

61     As such, I found that the Victim did indeed suffer grievous hurt.

62     It was not necessary for the Victim to have suffered any amputation, which misunderstanding the Accused appeared to labour under.

### Issue 3: Whether the Accused committed an act so negligently as to endanger human life?

63     In **_Tang Ling Lee v PP_**[^42], See J opined that “\[a\] key ingredient of a Section 338(b) offence is that the negligent act must have endangered human life or personal safety. The fact that grievous bodily injury has been caused is itself indicative that the harm occasioned to the victim is not slight or minor”. [^43]

64     At this juncture, I would state that In the Accused’s submissions, he touched on various points:

> (a)     His attempts for AGC to drop the charge against him; and

> (b)     Allegedly not being given the charge sheet.

65     I was satisfied that as the Accused made the decision to claim trial, he would have known what he had been charged with at that time to come to that decision. After all, he asserted in his submissions that he “attend\[ed\] \[four\] court hearings and \[eight\] PTC sessions” and would be familiar with his own case.

66     In any event, even if the charge were amended prior to the outset of the trial, the charge as it stood at the outset of the trial was read to the Accused and plea was taken, and he confirmed that he wished to claim trial to the same.

67     Based on the evidence adduced in the course of this trial, I am satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had indeed caused grievous hurt to the Victim by doing an act so negligently as to endanger human life.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed penalties

68     The prescribed punishment for an offence under Section 338(b) of the Penal Code would be imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or a fine which may extend to $5,000, or both.

69     Section 42 of the Road Traffic Act states as follows:

> “42(1)    A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.”

### Antecedents

70     The Accused did not have any criminal record.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

71     The Prosecution sought a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment and 2 years’ disqualification.

72     The Prosecution relied on the case of **_Tang Ling Lee v PP_**[^44], where Justice See had set out a sentencing framework as follows:

> (a)     Category 1: lesser harm, lower culpability; applicable presumptive sentencing range was a fine.

> (b)     Category 2: greater harm and lower culpability or vice versa; applicable presumptive sentencing range was one to two weeks’ imprisonment.

> (c)     Category 3: greater harm and higher culpability; applicable presumptive sentencing range was more than two weeks’ imprisonment. [^45]

73     Justice See also elaborated on the 2-step approach:

> (a)     Identify the sentencing band within which the offence in question fell, and ask whether the particular case fell within the applicable presumptive sentencing range, having regard to the twin considerations of harm and culpability, in order to derive the starting point sentence; and

> (b)     Make further adjustments to take into account the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors. [^46]

74     In the final analysis, the appropriate sentence to be imposed would be the product of a fact-sensitive exercise of discretion, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. An appropriate period of disqualification should also be ordered. [^47]

75     The Prosecution submitted that the present case fell under Category 2. Culpability was high because the Accused had persisted in making the left turn despite having knowledge that there was a blind spot that he could not check while on the expressway. His left turn was also executed in the middle of the chevron marking in a last-minute attempt to exit the expressway.

76     The Prosecution submitted that harm was moderate: the Victim suffered multiple fractures, was hospitalised for about a week and had to undergo procedures.

77     The Prosecution then highlighted the aggravating factors. The Prosecution pointed out that the Accused had claimed trial, and displayed a blatant lack of remorse as evidenced in his written submissions, where many spurious allegations were made against entities such as the Traffic Police, the Prosecution and prosecution witnesses. The Prosecution also submitted that it was disingenuous of the Accused to cast blame on the Victim by alleging that he committed the offence of dangerous driving.

78     The Prosecution accepted that the Accused’s clean record would be a mitigating factor.

79     The Prosecution also highlighted the following cases:

> (a)     Case of **_PP v Ong Heng Chua [^48]_**:

>> Ong Heng Chua had pleaded guilty. His sentence was enhanced to a 1-week imprisonment and 18 months’ disqualification on appeal.

>> When entering a car park, Ong Heng Chua did not follow the directional sign and allowed his vehicle to encroach into the opposite side of the road against the flow of traffic.

>> He collided into the victim and her motorcycle.

>> The victim suffered three fractures and a laceration on her thigh, and was warded for 13 days and discharged with 32 days’ hospitalisation leave.

>> Ong Heng Hua had 16 related offences for which he was given composition fines and demerit points, last offence was 10 months before the subject offence.

> (b)     Case of **_PP v Lim Yeok Wah_**[^49]:

>> Lim Yeok Wah faced two charges under Section 338(b) Penal Code. He had pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment and three years’ disqualification and six weeks’ imprisonment and three years’ disqualification, leading to a global sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment and three years’ disqualification.

>> The victims were on a bicycle travelling beside the left road kerb.

>> Lim Yeok Wah was a public transport worker driving a motor bus when he failed to keep a proper lookout and collided into the rear of the bicycle.

>> Lim Yeok Wah was found to be in Category 3 given the high culpability (he was going straight and had a clear and prolonged view of the victims; it took him a few seconds to even realise he had hit the victims) and high harm (victims both suffered traumatic brain injury, fractures and internal injuries. Male victim has significant cognitive impairment which is likely to be permanent. Female victim is permanently disabled.).

### Mitigation and Accused’s Submissions on Sentence

80     The Accused did not say anything in Mitigation nor make any submissions on sentence.

### Decision on Sentence

81     Having considered the facts of the case, I assessed the Accused’s culpability to be high.

82     The accident took place on an expressway. Unlike the accident location of the carpark in **_PP v Ong Heng Chua_**, expressways have a higher speed limit and vehicles are generally fast moving. At the time of the accident, the traffic volume was moderate, which meant there was a not insignificant number of other road users at that time.

83     Yet, the Accused executed his left turn after the start of the chevron marking in a last-minute attempt to exit the expressway.

84     Like the accused in **_PP v Lim Yeok Wah_**, the Accused plied the road for his livelihood. He was cavalier about the fact that the covered windows obscured his view of the blind spot, and lackadaisically did nothing further to address the blind spot and to check that it was safe before making the turn.

85     Without keeping a proper lookout, the Accused simply persisted in making the left turn.

86     I assessed the harm occasioned to be moderate.

87     I accepted that the injuries suffered by the Victim were not as severe, extensive and permanent as those suffered by the victims in **_PP v Lim Yeok Wah._** However, given the multiple fractures at various parts of the body and the duration of hospitalisation and treatment required, harm could not be characterised as slight.

88     I thus identified Category 2 as the appropriate sentencing band, towards the higher end of the band.

89     To the Accused’s credit, he had no antecedents.

90     The Accused claimed trial. The mitigating weight to be accorded to a timeous plea of guilt would not be applicable in this case.

91     I noted that in his submissions, the Accused faulted, inter alia, SSS Rafael (“lackadaisical work attitude”), Corporal Rio (“he could have done more”) and SI Norashikin (“she thought she had nailed it, but I would say that it was extremely short-sighted on her part”). He also cast aspersions on the Prosecution, insinuating that they may have knowingly allowed false testimony or suppressed material facts in this case, when they are state employees, and that “doubt should be cast on the intellect of the Prosecution team”. [^50] These are all serious allegations to make, but the Accused did not further substantiate these allegations.

92     The sentence to be meted to the Accused must serve the purpose of deterrence:

> (a)     Specific deterrence: to discourage the Accused from being negligent in the course of plying the roads; and

> (b)     General deterrence: to remind road users to exercise due care and caution when on the roads.

93     Indeed, the disqualification order was necessary for the protection of society, to prevent future harm that the Accused might cause to the public, and deterrence, because such orders deprived the Accused of the freedom to drive. [^51]

94     The sentence of meted out to the Accused, of 12 days’ imprisonment and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 20 months with effect from the date of release, was not discordant with the precedent cases cited.

95     The Accused’s sentence was nowhere as harsh as that in **_PP v Lim Yeok Wah_**, and rightly so, as I acknowledged that greater culpability and harm was demonstrated in **_PP v Lim Yeok Wah_**, with Lim Yeok Wah being a public transport worker who collided into the victims despite being on a relatively straight road and he could have seen them, and the more serious injuries sustained by those victims.

96     The Accused’s sentence was also not discordant with that in **_PP v Ong Heng Chua_**. While I found the injuries in both the cases to be of similar gravity, I noted that although Ong Heng Chua had a bad driving history, he had pleaded guilty. On the other hand, the Accused, although without antecedents, had claimed trial and demonstrated little, if not no, remorse. I also found the circumstances surrounding the Accused’s execution of the left turn on the slip road of the expressway to be more culpable than that of Ong Heng Chua’s manoeuvre at the car park.

97     In particular, I noted also that Justice See had found that the 18-months disqualification order in **_PP v Ong Heng Chua_** was “very much on the low side”. [^52] Given that the disqualification period for Ong Heng Chua would well have been higher, the 20-months disqualification meted out to the Accused would not be manifestly excessive.

## Conclusion

98     I sentenced the Accused to 12 days’ imprisonment and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 20 months with effect from the date of release.

99     Given the imprisonment spectrum is of two years and the facts of the case, 12 days’ imprisonment would not be manifestly excessive. The sentence meted out to the Accused is also not discordant with the post-**_Tang Ling Lee_** precedents cited.

100    The Accused, dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence (including the disqualification order) has filed an appeal.

101    The Accused is presently out on bail pending appeal.
