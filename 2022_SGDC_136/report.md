### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused, aged 61 years, pleaded guilty to three charges as follows: consumption of a specified drug, methamphetamine, an offence under s 8(b)(ii) p/u s 33A(2) (‘LT2 charge’) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008) (‘the MDA’) and s 50T Prisons Act (Cap 247, Rev Ed 2000), possession of a scheduled weapon under s 7(1)(a) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, Rev Ed 2013) (‘CESOWA’) p/u s 50T Prisons Act and using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) punishable under s 50T Prisons Act. Three charges were taken into consideration – criminal intimidation under s 506 Penal Code p/u s 50T Prisons Act, mischief under s 426 Penal Code p/u s 50T Prisons Act and one count of disorderly behaviour under s 20 Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, Rev Ed 1997) p/u s 50T Prisons Act.

2       He was sentenced to seven years’ and three months’ imprisonment with an enhanced sentence of 368 days’ imprisonment on the LT2 charge, three months’ imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 110 days’ imprisonment on the s 353 charge and six months’ imprisonment with an enhanced sentence of 268 days’ imprisonment on the CESOWA charge. The sentences on the LT2 and the s 353 charges were ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence was therefore seven years’ and six months imprisonment’ with an enhanced sentence of 746 days’ imprisonment.

## Summary of Facts

### Section 353 charge

3       The victim is a Special Constabulary Sergeant who was carrying out duties as a police officer.

4       On 15 October 2021, the accused was admitted to the Accident & Emergency Department of Sengkang General Hospital. The police were activated as the accused was holding on to a metal rod in a handicap toilet. The victim was amongst the officers who attended. He was equipped with a tactical shield for protection. The victim’s colleague asked the accused to put down the metal rod. He refused to do so. He instead picked up a dustbin, which was in the toilet, and threw it at the victim. This was done to deter the victim from discharging his duty. The victim managed to block the dustbin with his tactical shield. However, it landed on his foot. The accused was subsequently arrested by the police officers.

5       The accused was from 27 March 2021 to 20 October 2023, subject to a remission order made under the Prisons Act. As he committed this offence during the period of the order, he is liable to a maximum enhanced sentence of 736 days.

### The LT2 consumption charge

6       Following his arrest, the accused was required to provide a specimen of his urine. He complied. The specimens were analysed by analysts from the Health Sciences Authority and found to contain methamphetamine, which is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA.

7       The accused was from 27 March 2021 to 20 October 2023, subject to a remission order made under the Prisons Act. As he committed the offence whilst subject to the order, he is also liable to a maximum enhanced sentence of 736 days.

### Possession of scheduled weapon

8       On 30 July 2021 at about 11.15am, the complainant was manning the cashier counter at his shop when the accused entered to purchase beer. He threw the money on the cashier’s table when he was going to make payment. The complainant told the accused off for being rude. A dispute ensued. The accused left the shop and returned shortly. He told the complainant that he wanted to talk to him outside the shop. While outside the shop, he took out a butterfly knife from his bag and held it in his hand. Subsequently, someone intervened and brought the accused away.

9       The accused was from 30 July 2021 to 20 October 2023, subject to a remission order made under the Prisons Act. As he committed the offence during the remission order, he is liable to a maximum enhanced sentence of 813 days.

## Mitigation

10     The accused only stated that he committed the s 353 offence on the day he was sacked from his employment.

## Sentence

### LT2 consumption

11     The offence carries a minimum term of seven years and a maximum term of 13 years imprisonment. The accused is not liable to the prescribed mandatory caning of between six to 12 strokes.

12     The accused has the following drug related antecedents. In May 1991, he was fined $1,000 for consumption of a controlled drug. In September 1994, he was sentenced to a total imprisonment term of four months’ for failing to report for urine tests. In January 1996, he was admitted to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (‘DRC’) for 14 months’. He was released in March 1997. In June 1997, he was again admitted to a DRC. For this second admission, the duration was 18 months’. In September 1999, he was sentenced to five and a half years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for a LT1 offence and an additional aggregate term of six months’ imprisonment for three charges of failing to report for urine tests. His total sentence was six years’ imprisonment and three strokes. In March 2009, he was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for a LT2 offence. He was also convicted of charges under the Films Act for which he received an additional three months’ imprisonment. In March 2016, he was sentenced to seven years and nine months’ imprisonment for a second LT2 offence. He received a concurrent term of one year’s imprisonment term for drug possession. A drug utensils charge was TICed. On 27 March 2021, he was released on remission order under 50I of the Prisons Act with his remaining sentence from 27 March 2021 to 20 October 2023 being suspended.

13     This was the accused’s third LT2 offence. He reoffended less than seven months after his release. The mandatory minimum sentence was inappropriate in principle due to his antecedents. Whilst, in principle a sentence higher than the previous sentence was appropriate to give effect to specific deterrence in view of his recalcitrance, the uplift was adjusted to avoid an overall crushing sentence. Accordingly, only a small uplift was factored to give a sentence of seven years and three months’ imprisonment.

14     I turn to the s 50T enhanced sentence. In _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span> (‘_Abdul Mutalib’_), the High Court summarised the sentencing framework as follows at \[87\]:

> (a)    First, the court should consider the gravity of the fresh or s 50Y offence committed by the offender while on remission, the offender’s rehabilitative prospects and “all other relevant circumstances”:

>> (i)    The gravity of the fresh or s 50Y offence committed by the offender: This will ordinarily be a significant factor in the sentencing court’s consideration. In general, the more severe the fresh or s 50Y offence committed by the offender and the greater the harm caused, the longer the enhanced sentence under s 50T or the sentence under s 50Y (as the case may be) will be. In relation to enhanced sentences under s 50T specifically, the underlying sentence imposed for the fresh offence committed by the offender will be a _significant limiting factor_ in relation to any enhanced sentence that may be imposed.

>> (ii)   The offender’s rehabilitative prospects: In assessing the offender’s rehabilitative prospects, the court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including the statutory factors under ss 50T(3) and 50Y(2) of similarity between the original offence and the fresh offence, the timing of the fresh or s 50Y offence relative to the date of the offender’s release from prison on remission and any evidence of a lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration on the offender’s part.

>> (iii)   “\[A\]ll other relevant circumstances”: This is a residual catch-all category which informs the court’s overall sentencing analysis, although care should be taken to avoid double-counting any factors.

15     Here, the fresh LT2 offence is of moderate to high gravity. It is identical to the original offence. There was a lapse of close to seven months between the commencement of his remission order and this offence. His string of drug-related antecedents which started in 1991 relating to drug consumption, failure to attend urine tests and drug possession weigh against him. In these circumstances, the accused’s prospects of rehabilitation cannot be viewed as promising.

16     Next, based on the factors at \[14\], I had to determine which sentencing band the case falls under (see para 87(b) of _Abdul Mutalib_). Taking all the circumstances together, the overall severity of the accused’s fresh LT-2 drug consumption offence fell at the cusp of Band 3, i.e. ‘high severity’. The prosecution urged me to impose an enhanced sentence of 368 days of the remaining remission period of 736 days. This represented a calibration which was about the mid-point of Band 2, i.e. moderate severity. Having regard to the fact that the aggregate sentence must not offend any considerations of totality or proportionality, I accepted the prosecution’s submission. The accused was thus sentenced to an enhanced sentence of 368 days’, seven years’ and three months’ imprisonment on the LT2 charge.

### Use of criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty

17     Section 353 Penal Code prescribes an imprisonment term which may extend to four years or with fine or with both.

18     The presumptive sentencing ranges which apply to first-time offenders who claim trial as set out in _Aw Soy Tee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 5 SLR 453</span> at \[30\] are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="13.6427285457091%"><col width="40.9081816363273%"><col width="45.4490898179636%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Category</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Circumstances</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing band</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or up to three months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability Or Lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to eighteen months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eighteen months to four years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

19     As regards harm, the victim was not injured. With respect to culpability, the entire circumstances must be looked at. The offence occurred on hospital premises. The accused did not state why he went to the A&E but explained his behaviour to be the result of him being terminated from his employment on the same day. The accused’s refusal to put down the rod amount to defiance. He continued his defiant behaviour and threw the dustbin at the victim. In these circumstances, his culpability was high. Accordingly, the offence fell within category 2 of ‘lesser harm and higher culpability’. The accused has an antecedent for culpable homicide not amounting to murder in 1985 where he received six years’ imprisonment. The prosecution submitted that the appropriate range would be three to five months’ imprisonment. I agreed with this sentencing range, and imposed a sentence at the start of the range of three months’ imprisonment, which took into account his plea of guilt and the totality principle.

20     I turn to the s 50T enhanced sentence. I considered the gravity of the offence to be moderate. There is no similarity between this fresh offence and his original offence. I accepted the prosecution’s submission to place this offence within band 1 (i.e. low severity) of the sentencing framework and to impose an enhanced sentence of 110 days, which is around 15 per cent of the remaining remission period of 736 days as at 15 October 2021. This was slightly above the underlying sentence, which was calibrated downwards due to the totality principle, but within the sentencing range.

### Possession of a scheduled weapon

21     The offence under s 7(1)(a) of the CESOWA carries mandatory imprisonment not exceeding five years. The accused is not liable to the mandatory caning of six strokes.

22     The prosecution cited sentencing statistics from the Sentencing Information Repository (‘SIR’) which showed the median sentence as six months’ imprisonment. The 75th percentile sentence is eight months’ imprisonment. Here, the scheduled weapon is a butterfly knife. It is a type of folding pocketknife which was described as a knife with a blade which opens when hand pressure is applied to its handle. I noted the accused had brandished the knife which was the subject of the TIC charge. I was of the view that the median sentence was appropriate and imposed a sentence of six months’ imprisonment.

23     As for the s 50T enhanced sentence, I considered this fresh offence to be of moderate gravity. There is no similarity between this fresh offence and his original offence. This offence was committed within two months of his release. His commitment to rehabilitation can only be described to be low. I accepted that the enhanced sentence should be adjusted to fall within the high end of Band 1 and imposed a sentence of 268 days of the remaining remission period of 813 days as at 30 July 2021. The enhanced sentence is within the sentencing range of the underlying offence.

## Consecutive sentences

24     The sentence on the LT2 charge and the sentence on the s 353 charge were ordered to run consecutively. As the individual sentences were calibrated downward to guard against the imposition of a crushing aggregate sentence and the shorter imprisonment term on the s 353 charge was ordered to run consecutively, no further downward calibration was therefore warranted. The total s 50T sentence was therefore 746 days’ imprisonment (out of the maximum 813 days which the accused was liable to) and seven years’ and six months’ imprisonment.
