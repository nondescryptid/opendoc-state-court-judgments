Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Forms of punishment – Offender pleaded guilty to providing false information – Newton hearing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9018/2020/01-02.\]

1 June 2020

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“PC”), which is reproduced below:

> “You…Chua Wen Hao… are charged that you, on 12 September 2017, at or about 11.00 pm, at Hotel 81 Violet at No. 97 Lavender Street (“the Hotel”), Singapore, did give false information to a public servant, namely, one Investigation Officer Sunny Foo Shanyi (“IO Foo”) of the Singapore Police Force, to wit, you told IO Foo that you did not know the identity of the male subject who had entered Room 301 of the Hotel at about 9.25pm and had not allowed him to enter the room, which information you knew to be false, knowing it to be likely that you would thereby cause IO Foo to use his lawful power to investigate into the identity of the said male subject, which such public servant ought not to do if the true state of facts respecting which such information was given were known by him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (‘SOF’)[^1] without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly.

3       The Prosecution then gave its sentencing position followed by the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation. Arising from the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation, a Newton hearing was held. I shall deal with the Newton hearing in more detail in these grounds.

4       At the conclusion of the Newton hearing, the case returned to the sentencing stage. After hearing both parties’ submissions, I sentenced the Accused to a Short Detention Order for a period of 10 days.

5       Both the Prosecution and the Defence, being dissatisfied with the sentence, have separately filed an appeal against the sentence. The Defence applied for and was granted a stay on the execution of the Short Detention Order. The Accused is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

6       In these Grounds of Decision, I shall first set out the SOF. I will then deal with the evidence adduced at the Newton hearing before providing my reasons behind my decision to impose a Short Detention Order for a period of 10 days.

## Statement of Facts

7       The portions of the SOF which are pertinent to the commission of the offence by the Accused are reproduced in full below:

> THE INVOLVED PARTIES

> The complainant is Oh Shao Qi, a 26-year-old male Singapore Citizen. At the material time, he worked as a manager for Hotel 81 Violet located at No. 97 Lavender Street, Singapore 338722 (“the Hotel”).

> 2.    The witness is Suhailah Binte Mohamed Yusof, a 36-year-old female Singapore Citizen. At the material time, she worked as a front desk staff for the Hotel.

> 3.    The victim is Sunny Foo Shanyi, a 47-year-old male Singapore Citizen. At the material time, he was a Police Officer of the Singapore Police Force holding the rank of Station Inspector, attached to the Investigation Branch of Central Division.

> 4.    The accused person is Chua Wen Hao, a 28-year-old male.

> 5.    The co-accused person is Lau Sheng Shiun, a 33-year-old male. He is a friend and colleague of the accused.

> FIRST INFORMATION REPORT

> 6.    On 12th September 2017 at about 10.07 pm, the complainant called ‘999’ and reported the following message: “One guest burnt our linen towel because he was unhappy with us. He actually tried to sneak another friend into a 2 room hotel room. Now he left already. Please come down now.” The incident location was given to be the Hotel.

> FACTS RELATING TO THE CHARGE

> 7.    Investigations revealed that on the afternoon of 12th September 2017, both accused persons met up and went to W KTV, located at Foch Road. There, they had a few drinks and met a Vietnamese girl. The 3 of them then decided to head to the Hotel. The accused and the Vietnamese girl checked-in at the front desk of the Hotel at 9.19pm. They were given the keys to Room 301 and they entered the room at 9.23pm.

> 8.    A minute later, at 9.24pm, the co-accused entered the Hotel and entered Room 301. The witness noticed from CCTV footages that the co-accused had entered Room 301, in breach of the Hotel’s policy to disallow more than 2 persons per room. The witness tried then to call the Room 301 but did not manage to get through. She then went up to the Room 301 and knocked on the door. The accused answered the door and the witness told him that the room could only accommodate 2 people. The accused denied having the co-accused in the room and closed the door. A few minutes later, the co-accused came out of the room and asked the witness if he could book a room for 3 people. However, his request was rejected. Angered at this, the co-accused left the Hotel through the back door and smoked near the back of the Hotel, where the Hotel towels were kept in a crate. At 9.49pm, he lit the Hotel towels on fire and left the scene. A passer-by informed Hotel staff of the fire, and the complainant thus dialled for police assistance.

> 9.    In response to the ‘999’ call, the victim Investigation Officer Sunny Foo Shanyi (“IO Foo”), proceeded to the Hotel with 2 officers. IO Foo gathered that the co-accused, who had set fire to the Hotel towels, had previously entered Room 301 where the accused was. IO Foo thus located the accused and asked him whether he knew the male subject who had earlier entered Room 301 at about 9:25pm. IO Foo informed the accused that the male subject had set fire to Hotel towels, and showed the accused a screenshot of the Hotel CCTV showing the co-accused. The accused replied that he did not know the male subject. IO Foo then informed the accused that he would be recording a statement from him, told the accused to speak the truth, and warned the accused that providing false information was an offence. The accused acknowledged this.

> 10.    IO Foo thus commenced recording a statement from the accused under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) at about 11pm (Annex A[^2] to SOF). In the statement, the accused maintained that he did not know the identity of the male subject who had entered Room 301 of the Hotel at about 9.25pm and had not allowed him to enter. The accused also said that he had earlier gone to W KTV alone.

> 11.    The accused intentionally told the false information to IO Foo. The accused knew that in giving this false information, he would thereby cause IO Foo to use his lawful power to investigate into the identity of the male subject, which IO Foo ought not to do if the true state of facts respecting which such information was given by the accused were known by him.

> 12.    As a result of the false information given by the accused, IO Foo commenced investigations into the identity of the male subject. Police officers conducted ground enquiries at the Hotel and viewed CCTV footages. Police officers also made enquiries at W KTV and reviewed CCTV footages from W KTV. A total of 21.9 man hours between 5 officers were spent attempting to establish the identity of the male subject. Through reviewing CCTV footages from W KTV, officers realized that the accused and co-accused had in fact arrived at W KTV together, and left within 3 minutes of each other. Officers then established the co-accused’s identity though the credit card and phone details used to pay for the KTV room charges.

> 13.    The Police then made arrangements to interview the accused on 20 September 2017. On that day, a further s 22 CPC statement was recorded from the accused (Annex B[^3]), wherein the accused recanted the false information he told IO Foo on 12 September 2017. The accused revealed the identity of the co-accused, which the police had already established by then.

> \[_Note: Hereinafter, Annex A shall be referred to as the First Statement and Annex B shall be referred to as the Second Statement.\]_

## Newton Hearing

8       During the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation, Counsel for the Accused raised a point in relation to paragraph 9 of the SOF. Paragraph 9 of the SOF states that when IO Sunny Foo (“IO Foo”) arrived at the hotel, he informed the Accused that the male subject had set fire to the hotel towels and showed the Accused a screenshot of the hotel CCTV showing the male subject.

9       Counsel informed the Court that the Accused could neither confirm nor deny paragraph 9 of the SOF as the Accused’s position was essentially that he was quite drunk.[^4] The Accused admitted he knew that IO Foo was asking about the identity of the male subject, but had falsely denied knowing the person.[^5] With regard to the portion about setting fire to the hotel towels, the Accused’s position was that he had only put the connection together when he saw the fire engine as he was leaving the scene. The Defence alleged that when IO Foo was questioning the Accused, this was not operating on the mind of the Accused.[^6]

10     The Court clarified that if the Accused did not accept paragraph 9 of the SOF, the Court would have to reject the plea of guilt.[^7] In response, Counsel explained that the Accused accepted paragraph 9 in the sense that he was not in a position to deny, as he was essentially drunk that day.[^8] The Prosecution submitted that paragraph 9 contained a material fact which was IO Foo had informed the Accused that the male subject had set fire to the hotel towels[^9], which, as the Court has observed, then led to the Accused giving a false statement.

11     The dispute in relation to paragraph 9 of the SOF goes towards the culpability of the Accused. The extent of an offender’s culpability would affect the appropriate punishment a court should impose. In the circumstances, the Court held that a Newton hearing was required in order to establish the facts surrounding paragraph 9 of the SOF.[^10]

12     The Prosecution called only IO Foo as its witness for the Newton hearing, while the Defence called the Accused as its only witness. The Defence also relied on an earlier version of a statement of fact[^11] (which was prepared by one Lee Hui Min) for the Newton hearing.[^12]

### PW1 Sunny Foo (IO Foo)

13     IO Foo testified that he had responded to the incident on 12 September 2017 with two of his colleagues. At the scene of the incident, IO Foo was briefed on the case that someone had set fire to the hotel towels.[^13] As part of the preliminary investigation, he gathered that the person who had set fire to the hotel towels came out from a room where two other persons were inside.[^14]

14     Subsequently, at the lobby of the hotel, IO Foo spoke to the Accused. The Accused was in that room where the person who had set fire to the towels had come out.[^15] IO Foo spoke to the Accused to get the particulars of the person who had set fire to the towels. He informed the Accused that this particular person had set fire and it was a serious offence, and not to cover up that person if he knows the person.[^16] IO Foo also showed the Accused a screenshot obtained from the CCTV footage of the person who had set fire to the towels for the Accused to identify whether that was his friend.[^17] Despite IO Foo telling him that the person had entered his room and advised him to tell the truth otherwise he may get into trouble for hiding the identity of the person, the Accused’s response was that he does not recognise the person.[^18] IO Foo testified that he was very sure he had told the Accused that the person in red shirt[^19] had set fire because it was in his best interest to find the person as soon as possible.[^20]

15     IO Foo eventually recorded a statement from the Accused. This was the First Statement.[^21] Before the commencement of the recording of the First Statement, IO Foo administered a similar caution to the Accused that if he were to provide false information, he would be subsequently be investigated for providing a police officer with false information.[^22] IO Foo told the Court that during the recording of the statement, the Accused was attentive and did not appear as though he did not understand what was being discussed.[^23] Even though the Accused appeared a bit drunk, there was no difficulties in communications, and there was no need to ask for any clarifications from the Accused.[^24]

### DW1 Chua Wen Hao

16     The Accused testified that he knew a person by the name of Lau Sheng Shiun from the Navy. Lau Sheng Shiun was known to the Accused as Shank Lau (“Shank”). For a period, Shank was the Accused’s direct supervisor. At the time of the Newton Hearing, Shank was no longer his supervising officer although they still work together at Tuas Naval Base.[^25]

17     The Accused testified that on the afternoon of 12 September 2017, both he and Shank had gone drinking at W KTV.[^26] Each of them drank about five jars of beer.[^27] Towards the end of the KTV session, a Vietnamese woman joined them for drinks.[^28]

18     After the KTV session, they walked for about 5 to 10 minutes to arrive at the hotel. At that point, the Accused did not know where Shank had gone. However, there was an understanding that Shank would return to continue drinking with the Accused.[^29] When the Accused and the Vietnamese woman arrived at the hotel, the Accused checked into a room with the Vietnamese woman. The Accused sent a message to Shank informing him of the room number. Subsequently, Shank arrived at the room.[^30]

19     Not long after Shank arrived, the telephone rang, and the receptionist said that the hotel disallowed three persons to be inside a room. The Accused then told Shank about this. Not long after, a hotel staff knocked on the room door, and once again told the Accused that the hotel did not allow three persons to be inside the room. The Accused told Shank about it, and Shank left.[^31]

20     Around 5 to 10 minutes after Shank left, a police officer came and knocked on the room door. The police officer asked the Accused whether he saw any suspicious person, and the Accused answered “No”. The Accused thought it was “strange” as he did not do anything wrong and he did not know what was going on. He decided to go home as he had to sail the next morning. The Accused proceeded to finish the beer and left the room.[^32]

21     The Accused was stopped from leaving the hotel.[^33] According to the Accused, he did not know why he was not allowed to leave. Instead, he was told to wait for the investigating officer to arrive. He was frightened, and called his superior, his Encik, one ME3 Robin Lee. After a while, the investigating officer arrived and the Accused was told to sit at the lobby and wait. The Accused waited for about 20 minutes, and was not allowed to go anywhere, not even to the toilet.[^34] The Accused recalled that at that point in time, the uniformed police officer was there, as well as two investigating officers and the hotel staff. There was no fireman at the hotel then. The firemen came later.[^35]

22     After IO Foo and two other police officers have arrived at the hotel, the Accused called his Encik again. His Encik spoke to IO Foo. The Accused next remembered that he was asked to go to the reception counter and was shown a photograph from the TV of a person who looked like his friend, Shank.[^36] According to the Accused, IO Foo only asked if he knew the person and the Accused answered “No”.[^37] He could not remember what else the IO Foo had asked him.[^38] Specifically, he could not remember whether IO Foo had told him that the man in the screenshot had set fire to the hotel towels. The Accused stated that he was not in a position to dispute nor disagree.[^39] The Accused admitted that at the very least, he knew that his friend had done something wrong to warrant police investigations.[^40] After that, the firemen came. One of the firemen asked for his identity card. Subsequently, he was allowed to leave the hotel.[^41]

### Prosecution’s Submissions on the Newton hearing

23     The Prosecution, in its oral submission, argued that there was sufficient evidence to find that IO Foo had told the Accused of what Shank had done before recording a statement from the Accused. IO Foo had testified that it was in his best interest to do so as he needed to impress upon the Accused that a serious offence has been committed so that the Accused would not hide the identity of the perpetrator.[^42]

24     The Prosecution also argued that it was not believable for the Accused to have been in a drunken state such that he may not have registered what IO Foo had said. The Prosecution pointed out that the Accused had the presence of mind to have given a detailed narrative of the events that day to IO Foo, including erasing the presence of Shank from the narrative. According to the Prosecution, the Accused was not so drunk as to be incapable of registering what IO Foo had told him.[^43]

25     The Prosecution further argued that paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Second Statement[^44] showed that the flow of events as narrated would only make sense if the Accused had been told by IO Foo at the hotel that he was looking for a person who had set fire to the hotel’s towels.[^45] Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Second Statement are reproduced below:

> 5.    When Shank came up, I opened the door for him to come in. A few minutes later, a hotel staff knocked the door and told me that the hotel does not allow 3 persons to a room. I then told Shank and he left about 5 minutes later. I then stayed in the room with the Vietnamese girl until the police came knocking on my door looking for my friend. I was later informed that my friend had set some towels on fire at the hotel.

> 6.    I contacted Shank and told him what had happened. I asked him if he had set fire and he told me he did not. We did not talk further. Shank also did not tell me not to tell the police anything or ask me what I had told the police.”

26     Lastly, the Prosecution submitted that in the alternative, even if it could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt that IO Foo had mentioned the specific offence of committing mischief by fire to the Accused, there was at the very least a suggestion made to the Accused by IO Foo that the friend had done something wrong to warrant police investigations.[^46]

### Defence’s Submissions on the Newton Hearing

27     The Defence tendered written submissions.[^47] At the outset, the Defence pointed out and reiterated that the sole issue was in relation to the mental state of the Accused at the point in time when IO Foo asked him for the identity of the perpetrator.[^48]

28     The Defence submitted that IO Foo’s evidence was to be treated with suspect. The fact of whether IO Foo had informed the Accused about the towels being set on fire by Shank was not recorded down in any statement, field diary or written document. In other words, IO Foo’s testimony was based solely on his memory.[^49] The Defence’s submission was that the reliability of IO Foo’s memory should be scrutinized carefully because there were various facts, which he was unable to recall.[^50] For instance, when IO Foo first came to Court he could not remember the Accused’s name. In addition, IO Foo could not remember whether there was a CCTV, which captured the setting of the fire. Neither could he remember whether he had spoken to the Accused’s Encik on the phone.[^51] The Defence also referred the Court to Exhibit D2. Exhibit D2 was an unused earlier version of a statement of facts for this case. The Defence highlighted that the fact of IO Foo informing the Accused about the towels being set on fire by Shank has been omitted from Exhibit D2. According to the Defence, IO Foo could not remember if he was contacted to verify this in 2019 when the new SOF was drafted.[^52]

29     In relation to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Second Statement, Counsel argued that the Accused understood the statement to mean that he was only informed subsequently on 20 September 2017 that his friend had set fire to the hotel towels when he was at the police station to give his statement.[^53]

30     The Defence submitted that the Accused had always maintained the position that he was not aware that the person in the CCTV had set fire to the towels, and this fact was not operating on his mind at the material time.[^54] The Defence further submitted that the Accused had also candidly admitted during cross-examination that he was not in a position to dispute whether IO Foo had indeed informed him that his friend had set fire to the hotel towels because he was drunk.[^55] In summing up, the Defence argued that the Accused was a credible and reliable witness, as he was consistent in his testimony throughout cross-examination and honest in admitting that he was drunk.[^56]

### Court’s Finding

31     Having reviewed the evidence and considered the submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence, I found that on 12 September 2017, IO Foo had informed the Accused that the male subject in question had set fire to the hotel’s towels and that this conduct constituted a serious offence.[^57] This could be clearly gleaned from paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Second Statement. The Accused admitted that the events stated in paragraph 6 of the Second Statement took place on the day of the incident _i.e._ 12 September 2017, when he was in a taxi.[^58] In that regard, it was clear and sensible that the preceding paragraph, _i.e._ paragraph 5, would have logically referred to what had transpired on that day.

32     I also found that on the day of the incident, at the hotel, the Accused could function in an ordinary manner much alike any other person even though he has had consumed alcoholic drinks. He was able to appreciate his surroundings. He was able to comprehend the questions posed by IO Foo. Based on the account given in his First Statement, the Accused was able to provide a reasonably coherent account of the chain of events. However, it was an account in which the Accused had intentionally and deliberately left out the involvement and identity of Shank. The Accused also had the presence of mind to remember that he has a sailing exercise the next day, and therefore needed to extricate himself from the situation so that he could sail with his vessel. Moreover, to extricate himself, he called his Encik for help.

33     When viewed in light of his overall conduct and interactions on 12 September 2017, I found that the Accused’s mental capacity was not diminished in any significant manner even though he had consumed alcoholic drinks that night. The Accused knew what was asked of him by IO Foo, but had chosen to reply in the negative as to the identity Shank whom IO Foo was trying to ascertain. On the totality of the evidence, I did not find the Accused’s testimony to be credible.

34     In contrast, the testimony of IO Foo was simple and straightforward. IO Foo could remember clearly telling the Accused that his friend had set fire to the hotel towels because he had wanted to convey the seriousness of the offence to the Accused. Given the passage of time, I did not find the enumerated lapses in memory by IO Foo to be material. Furthermore, the Second Statement corroborated IO Foo’s account. I found IO Foo to be a credible witness and I accepted his evidence.

35     I shall now proceed to deal with the issue of sentence.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

36     The Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of at least two weeks. The Prosecution relied on the High Court’s decision in _Koh Yong Chiah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 447</span> (“_Koh Yong Chiah_”) which has set out a sentencing guideline for an offence of giving a false statement under s 182 PC.

37     In terms of the harm caused by the Accused, the Prosecution submitted that there was appreciable harm resulting from the false information as a total of 21.9 man-hours amongst five officers had been unnecessarily spent trying to establish the identity of co-accused. The Accused’s provision of the false information led the Police on a wild goose chase. The harm caused was not _de minimis_.[^59] The potential harm involved was also high, as it was entirely fortuitous that the officers ascertained the identity of the male subject after 21.9 hours and they did not have to spend more time trying to trace his identity, which would have frustrated the progress of other genuine investigations and unnecessarily diverted public resources from more deserving cases.[^60] Given that the predicate offence is one of mischief by fire, the Prosecution submitted that this was an aggravating factor to be considered.[^61]

38     In terms of the culpability of the Accused, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused had actual knowledge that the statement he had given was false as opposed to merely having reason to believe it was false. Not only did the Accused give the false statement orally when interviewed by IO Foo, the Accused maintained the falsehood in the First Statement. The Accused recanted the false information 8 days after the incident. Further, he had owned up only after the Police have arranged to interview him on 20 September.[^62]

39     The Prosecution argued that the present case is similar to the case of _PP v Poh Chee Hwee_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 241</span> where the offender pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 182 PC for giving false information that he was the driver of a motor van in order to help his brother avoid prosecution for driving while under disqualification.[^63] The predicate offence was a serious offence, and the offence of giving false information was premeditated. The offender in that case did not derive benefit, and no innocent party was implicated. The offender’s brother was ultimately brought to justice. The offender, who has no similar antecedents, was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment which sentence was was upheld on appeal.

40     On balance, the Prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold in the present case was clearly crossed,[^64] and a sentence of at least two weeks’ imprisonment was fair and appropriate.[^65]

## Mitigation Plea

41     Following the findings made by the Court at the conclusion of the Newton hearing, the Defence submitted a new Mitigation Plea.[^66] In the new Mitigation Plea, the Defence submitted that in light of the Accused’s low culpability and low level of harm, a fine would be sufficient and appropriate.[^67] The Defence highlighted several key points regarding the surrounding circumstances, some of which are summarised below:[^68]

> (a)     After Shank left the room, the Accused heard knocking on the door. He opened it to find a policeman standing outside. The policeman asked the Accused if he had seen a suspicious looking man, or if such a man had tried to enter his room. Shocked and scared upon being questioned by the policeman, the Accused replied no to both questions. Shortly after, the Accused decided to leave the hotel was but stopped by the same policeman.

> (b)     Around 5 minutes later, IO Foo arrived. IO Foo asked the Accused the same questions that were asked earlier by the policeman. IO Foo showed the Accused a screenshot of the hotel’s CCTV footage which contained an image of Shank. In the spur of the moment, and afraid to change his position, the Accused once again replied that he did not know the man shown in the CCTV footage.

> (c)     The Accused’s motivation for stating that he did not know Shank was not because he was trying to shield Shank from prosecution. Rather, the Accused was afraid that admitting that he knew Shank would make it difficult for him to work with Shank in future, as Shank was his superior.

> (d)     The Accused subsequently went on overseas deployments with the Navy from 13 September 2017 to 15 September 2017, and then from 18 September 2017 to 19 September 2017. On 20 September 2017, the Accused proceeded to the Police Cantonment Complex to provide the Police with a detailed statement, where he informed the police officer that the male subject shown in the CCTV footage of the hotel was his friend, Shank.

> (e)     While the Accused was in Singapore on 16 and 17 September 2017, he was catching up on lost sleep during the weekend. He was also unpacking and re-packing for his next deployment. It did not occur to him that there was an urgency to contact the investigating officer as soon as possible, or that any delay would be held against him.

42     The Defence raised several factors for the Court’s consideration and these are summarised below:

> (a)     The Accused had pleaded guilty timeously. He undertook not to repeat his mistakes and promised not to re-offend.[^69]

> (b)     The Accused had acted impulsively due to his state of inebriation, shock and fear. The Accused was afraid that Shank, who held the rank of a Captain and was his superior in the Navy, would think that he had gone to the Police to report him. Foolishly, he thought that it was best to distance himself from what could be seen as ratting out his superior.[^70]

> (c)     The Accused did not receive any personal gain either directly or indirectly from denying knowing who Shank was. There was also no harm caused to any innocent party from his false statement as the Accused did not give IO Foo a false identity in an attempt to lead the Police astray.[^71]

> (d)     The Accused was also fully cooperative with the Police, having recanted his statement eight days later on 20 September 2017.[^72]

> (e)     During the period of eight days, the Accused was on two overseas deployments, and spent the two days back in Singapore on 16 and 17 September 2017 resting and re-packing for his next deployment on 18 September 2017. The Accused had wanted to make a call, but he would have to utilise the secure line on the vessel to call Singapore during his off-duty hours. However, at that time, the Accused did not realise the gravity of the matter would have warranted that mode of communication. He also did not know how to contact the Investigation Officer as he was not given any contact information. The Accused thought it was fine for him to complete his deployments and then report to the police station when the Investigation Officer next contacted him for any clarifications.[^73]

> (f)     The Accused has no antecedents, and has always been a law-abiding citizen. He has a positive work history and has been a Navy Regular since joining eight years ago. He was consistently recognised for his exceptional performance and good character. During his Basic Military Training in 2012, he was awarded the Best Recruit Award. The Accused’s superior, Mr Jonathan Ng, provided a testimonial attesting to the Accused’s good character, strong work ethic and performance.[^74]

43     In arguing for the imposition of a fine as an appropriate sentence, the Defence cited the case of _PP v Vilashini d/o Nallan Rajanderan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 142</span> (“_Vilashini_”). In _Vilashini_, the offender pleaded guilty to a charge of drink driving under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act and another charge of giving false information to a public servant under s 182 of the Penal Code. Three other charges, one of which was another s 182 PC charge, were taken into consideration. The offender had lost control of her motor car after having consumed alcohol, and subsequently caused chain collisions involving seven vehicles (including the one driven by the offender). Thereafter, she lied to the Police that she had not driven the motor car. The offender recanted the false information the next day. The District Judge held that misleading investigative authorities for a day or two may not have the potential to bring about sufficient harm to justify a custodial term as the starting point, and imposed a fine of $4,000 for the proceeded s 182 PC charge.

44     In _PP v Yeo Fang Yi_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGMC 9</span> (“_Yeo Fang Yi_”), the offender pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 182 PC for providing false information to the Police that she was the driver of a vehicle to shield her friend from a drink-driving offence. Another charge under s 182 PC was taken into consideration. The District Judge imposed a sentence of one week’s imprisonment. In _Yeo Fang Yi_, the District Judge held that drink-driving was a serious offence and that the offender had perpetuated her falsehood for at least three years. The Defence sought to distinguish _Yeo Fang Yi_ by submitting that the present case was less aggravating as the Accused did not give false information to shield Shank but to distance himself from police involvement. The Accused also eventually came clean with the police after his overseas deployments.

## Sentence

45     The case of _Koh Yong Chiah_ provides a helpful starting point when determining the appropriate sentence for a s 182 PC offence. The offence covers an extensive array of misinformation: _Koh Yong Chiah_ at \[46\]. While it was difficult to categorise these offences based on any particular set of principal factual elements, the High Court gave some broad guidance as to the type of cases that would generally attract a custodial sentence. To summarise, whether the custodial threshold is crossed would be determined based on the degree of harm caused or likely to be caused. If appreciable harm may be caused by the s 182 PC offence, the court should impose a custodial term as a starting point: _Koh Yong Chiah_ at \[50\].

46     I agreed with the Prosecution that a custodial sentence was warranted in this case. Firstly, actual harm was caused. The false information provided by the Accused led to unnecessary investigative efforts being channelled to find out the identity of the perpetrator when the perpetrator was undoubtedly known to the Accused. The wastage of investigative resources could have frustrated the progress of other genuine investigations and unnecessarily diverted public resources away from deserving cases. Secondly, the Court noted that there were several culpability-increasing factors. For example, the Accused knew that he was giving a false statement right from the start, and in fact went to great lengths to provide an untruthful account in the First Statement to the Police in order to protect Shank’s identity and thereby shielding Shank from investigation, despite being warned that providing false information was an offence. Thirdly, there was no prompt recanting of the false information. In between two overseas deployment, the Accused was in Singapore on 16th and 17th September 2017 where he could have gone to the Police to confess to the false statement he has given. However, he did not do so. The Accused had only owned up after being contacted by the Police to attend an interview on 20 September 2017 and after his Navy superiors had advised him to tell the truth.

47     I shall now examine the cases cited by the Defence. In my judgment, the cases cited by the Defence did not support the position that a fine was an appropriate sentence in the present case. I was not persuaded by the Defence’s argument that the facts in the present case were less aggravating than the facts in _Yeo Fang Yi._ In _Vilashini_, the offender recanted her statement promptly the next day. In the present case, there was no similar urgency displayed by the Accused which had resulted in investigative resources being utilised unnecessarily.

48     In my judgment, a custodial sentence was warranted for this case. However, a custodial punishment need not necessarily take the form of a sentence of an imprisonment term. The CPC provides flexibility to the Courts to impose community-based sentences (“CBS”) in appropriate cases, and one of such sentencing options is the Short Detention Order (“SDO”).

49     An SDO is essentially a short imprisonment term. It is primarily a punitive measure inherently capable of serving as a form of deterrence: _PP v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1163</span> (“_Teo Chang Heng_”) at \[15\]. As compared to longer prison stays, an SDO is considered to be less disruptive and stigmatising: _Singapore Parliamentary Debates_, _Official Report_ (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 426. However, an SDO should not be perceived as a soft option, as the offender will be incarcerated pursuant to the SDO and will be deprived of his liberty: _Teo Chang Heng_ at \[15\].

50     Preliminarily, I did not find the Accused’s age of 29 to be a bar to imposing an SDO. In _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span>, See Kee Oon J held at \[40\] that offenders over the age of 21 should not be _ipso facto_ denied the opportunity to be considered for CBS. In every case, the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender in question must be carefully scrutinised and evaluated to determine the appropriateness of CBS.

51     I found the Accused to be suitable for SDO for the following reasons. Firstly, the Accused has no previous antecedents. Secondly, there did not appear to be at any risk of reoffending. Thirdly, I accepted the testimonial of the Accused’s good character and conduct given on his behalf by Mr Jonathan Ng. Fourthly, the Accused had in all likelihood acted out character in providing the false information to the Police. In my assessment, the Accused had committed the offence out of a misguided sense of loyalty towards Shank, his superior. Fifthly, the Accused has a stable educational and job prospects which would merit protection from disruption due to a sentence of imprisonment, and further bolstered the point above that he is unlikely to reoffend. Lastly, in terms of punishment, a SDO will result in the Accused spending time behind bars. It is a signal that what he did was serious and deserving of a custodial sentence: See _Teo Chang Heng_ at \[17\]. A SDO would not be manifestly inadequate as this was not a case which would have warranted a much lengthier term of more than two weeks’ imprisonment: see also _Teo Chang Heng_ at \[17\].

52     I was mindful that this case went through a Newton hearing. However, this in itself does not mean that the usual sentencing discount given for a plea of guilt should be taken away entirely. A small sentencing discount was still warranted in this case.

53     For all of the above reasons, taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the offence and the offender, a sentence of 10 days’ Short Detention Order was a fair and appropriate sentence which struck the balance between imposing a deterrent sentence and meaningfully reintegrating the Accused back into society.
