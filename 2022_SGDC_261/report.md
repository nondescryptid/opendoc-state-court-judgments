Criminal Law – Sentencing – Road Traffic Act – Drink Driving – Repeat Offender – Sentencing Considerations

3 November 2022

### District Judge Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz (delivering the judgment of the court _ex tempore_):

## Introduction

1       I have convicted the Accused of drink-driving. Having considered the parties’ submissions on sentence, my decision is briefly as follows.

## The Accused is a Repeat Offender

2       The Accused is not a first offender. In February 2005, he was convicted under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”) and fined $2,200 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than 15 months.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

3       As a repeat offender, the Accused is liable to be punished with a fine of not less than $5000 and not more than $20,000 and mandatory imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) In addition, s 67(2) prescribes that a repeat offender be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than five years, unless there are special reasons not to make such an order.

## The Parties’ Submissions on Sentence

4       The Prosecution seeks a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $8000 with a disqualification order of six years.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) In support of his sentencing position, DPP Teh cites the revised sentencing framework in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 224</span> (_“Rafael Voltaire”_).

5       The DPP also relies on _PP v Vijayan Mahadevan_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 22</span> where the offender, who had a blood alcohol level of approximately 76 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath, had been sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $10,000 and a disqualification order of 7 years. The DPP further highlighted the following aggravating factors in this case:[^4]

> a.     the significant distance travelled by the Accused whilst under the influence of alcohol;

> b.     the potential harm posed to other road users by virtue of the Accused having driven a heavy vehicle; and

> c.     the Accused’s conduct at trial.

6       Save for asking the Court to grant him an adjournment to update his employer of the outcome of these proceedings, the Accused did not proffer anything in mitigation when invited to do so.

## Sentencing Considerations

7       The applicable sentencing framework was set out in _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (_“Edwin Suse”_) and revised in _Rafael Voltaire_ (at \[31\])_._ In calibrating the sentence here, I consider it instructive to have regard to the following factors:

> a.     the extent to which the concentration of alcohol in the Accused’s breath exceeded the prescribed limit;

> b.     the Accused’s driving history;

> c.     where repeat offenders are concerned, the period between the previous drink-driving conviction and the commission of the present offence, as this serves as a useful indicator of the efficacy of the earlier sentence in deterring re-offending. The more recent the previous conviction, the greater the need for deterrence to feature in the sentence imposed;

> d.     the actual or potential danger posed by the Accused’s conduct in committing the offence;[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) and

> e.     the Accused’s conduct at trial.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

## The Sentence Imposed

8       Having regard to the factors distilled above, I would make the following observations vis-à-vis harm and culpability in the present case.

9       First, while the Accused’s breath alcohol level is not extremely high (placing him within Band 1 of the _Rafael Voltaire_ framework), it cannot be described as being marginally above the prescribed legal limit. I pause to highlight however, that I am not persuaded by the Prosecution’s reliance on the sentence imposed in _Vijayan Mahadevan_ as the blood alcohol level there was twice the prescribed limit and thus placed the offender squarely in the third band of the _Rafael Voltaire_ framework.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

10     Second, I agree with DPP Teh’s submission that there is aggravation accruing from the Accused’s wilful decision to drive a heavy vehicle for a significant distance (from Jalan Buroh to the vicinity of his residence along Fernvale Road) in blatant disregard of the prohibition against driving under the influence of drink. I cannot discount the potential harm posed by the Accused’s conduct.

11     Third, while there is a period of about 15 years’ between the Accused’s previous conviction and the commission of the present offence, I am mindful that he has committed four relatively serious speeding offences between his drink-driving offences:[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

12     However, while these antecedents reflect some disregard for road safety, I am conscious of the fact that they are not directly relevant to the present offence. I therefore do not place excessive weight on the Accused’s driving history.

13     Fourth, while the mere fact that an offender claims trial is not an aggravating factor, the Accused’s conduct at trial in this case betrays an absence of contrition. Despite the strength of the Prosecution’s evidence, the Accused persisted in strained attempts to explain away his multiple admissions of guilt (in Exhibits P2, P4 and P5) by casting grave and baseless allegations against the various police officers who had interacted with him in the course of investigations, accusing them of having suppressed information that he had given them. In all, 10 witnesses (not including the Accused) testified and five days were expended on a trial.

14     Finally, I am mindful that mitigating factors are wholly absent on the facts before me.

15     Drawing the threads together and giving due weight to each of the factors outlined above, I impose a sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment with a fine of $6000 (in default 20 days’ imprisonment). The Accused is also disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than 5 years from the date of his release from prison.
