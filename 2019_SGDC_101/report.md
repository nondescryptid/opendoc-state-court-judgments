### District Judge Marvin Bay:

This are my grounds setting out the basis for the conviction of Mr Muhammad Shahidin Bin Sahurdin.

### The charge

2       Mr Shahidin has claimed trial to the following charge[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) of an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

… that (he), on 2 August 2016 at about 6.15 p.m., at Blk 402, Hougang Avenue 10, Singapore 530402, together with one Muhammad Zulkifli Bin Syed Ali, **_in furtherance of the common intention_** of both of you, did traffic in a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act…, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, one (01) packet containing not less than 0.50 gram of crystalline substance which was pulverized and homogenized into a powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.33 gram of methamphetamine…

3       Plainly stated, Mr Shahidin is charged with having on 2 August 2016 at about 6.15 p.m., at Blk 402, Hougang Avenue 10, together with one Muhammad Zulkifli Bin Syed Ali, acting on their common intention to traffic in methamphetamine, by having in possession, for the purpose of trafficking, one packet which was found, upon analysis to contain not less than 0.33 gram of methamphetamine, better known in its street name of ‘**_Ice_**’. Mr Shahidin had initially faced a joint trial with Mr Zulkifli, but the latter had fled prior to the first day of trial[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). Mr Shahidin, the remaining accused person, had confirmed his intent to claim trial, and the trial had thus proceeded against the charge he faced. Mr Zulkifli was subsequently arrested, and produced in Court 26 on 30 December 2017.

4       The offence of trafficking in 0.33g of methamphetamine is punishable with a minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.

5       The Prosecution’s case was that Mr Shahidin had acted in concert with Mr Zulkifli to supply drugs to a certain Mr Mohamad Fadli Bin Abubakar (PW4), and had been on the way with Mr Zulkifli to deliver the packet of _Ice_ to Mr Fadli, when he was arrested in the evening of 2 August 2016. This delivery was made in a situation where, apparently unbeknownst to Mr Shahidin, Mr Fadli had himself been earlier arrested, and had been co-opted by CNB to bring in his drug supplier. It was a major point of the defence case that the packet of _Ice_ had been found on the person of Mr Zulkifli, and not the accused; Mr Shahidin.

### Agreed facts

6       The areas of dispute in this case have been greatly reduced by the prosecution and defence stipulating certain agreed facts, and formalising this agreement by a document setting out an agreed statement of facts[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). Per this document, the salient settled facts[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) are as follows:

3.    On 2 August 2016, at or about 5.45 p.m., acting on information received, ASP Lim Peng Chye ("ASP Lim") led a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau …to the vicinity of Blk 402 to look out for Shahidin. Sgt Ibrahim was tasked to observe unit #XXX of Blk 402 Hougang Ave 10 ("the unit").

4    At or about 6.15 p.m., Sgt Ibrahim informed the other CNB officers over radio that he has just seen two male subjects leave the unit. ASP Lim then instructed the rest of the CNB officers to proceed to the ground floor lift landing of Blk 402 to arrest the said two male subjects.

5    A short while later, Shahidin and Zulkifli came out of one of the lifts and were placed under arrest at the ground floor lift lobby. Both Shahidin and Zulkifli were then brought to the void deck of Blk 402, where each of them were searched.

6.    Cpl Laila conducted the search on Shahidin. Nothing incriminating was found on Shahidin, Sgt Zakaria conducted the search on Zulkifli. Sgt Zakaria recovered the following items from a red plastic bag that Zulkifli was carrying [\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5):

(a)    One Bluetooth headset box[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6), containing one red plastic bag[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) (later marked as) containing one green "Pall Mall" cigarette box[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) containing one packet of crystalline substance.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

…

7 …    Later on the same day, at the CNB office of Tanglin Police Division Headquarters, Sgt Sam Toh seized Shahidiri's personal items, which includes one blue Samsung phone[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)…

…

9 …    (The) packet containing not less than 0.50 gram of crystalline substance which was pulverised and homogenised into a powdery substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.33 gram of methamphetamine.

14.    (The DNA Profiling Laboratory) report states that Shahidin's DNA was found on the interior of … (the) Bluetooth headset box) as well as the exterior of (the)… green "Pall Mall" cigarette box.

15    Investigations revealed that Shahidin's blue Samsung phone marked as "SHAH-I" corresponded to the number XXX.

### Evidence of PW1; W/SSG Nurfarhanah Osman, and PW2; SSG Eugene Tong Kecheng

7       The stipulation on the above set of agreed facts, along with Mr Shahidin’s counsel’s indication that he would not be contesting the voluntariness of his long statement[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11), has made it unnecessary to set out the evidence of the first two prosecution witnesses PW1 W/SSG Nurfarhanah Osman and PW2 SSG Eugene Tong Kecheng in any great detail, as they had been largely involved in undisputed procedural aspects as the arrest of the accused, and the recording of statements P-9[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) and P10, respectively from Mr Shahidin.

8       W/SSG Nurfarhanah had been part of the arresting party, and indicated that she had been briefed to proceed to Block 402 Hougang Avenue 10 ‘**_to look out for a suspected trafficker by the name of Din’_**.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) The team was told that ‘Din’s’ full name was Mohammad Shahidin Bin Sahurdin[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14). At the scene, W/SSG Nurfarhanah had received information that there were two suspects leaving a unit at level 7. The officers deployed around the void deck of Block 402 Hougang Avenue 10 had waited for the two suspects to emerge from the lift before effecting arrest. Both were searched by CNB officers at different sites, and one of the officer recovered a packet of drug in a cigarette box. PW1 learnt that the person found with the drugs was Mr Zulkifli, and not the accused; Mr Shahidin. W/SSG Nurfahanah had recorded a contemporaneous statement from Mr Shahidin, with the salient portions set out[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15).

Q1:Who is this? (_Mr Fadli’s image shown to accused_)

A1:He is Amad, he is my friend’s brother and I known him since 2004.

Q2:What is the purpose of him coming to Hougang Avenue 10 Blk 402?

A2:Amad came down to **_see me_**.

Q3:Why did Amad want to see you?

A3:He want to take “barang” from my friend “Beng” (_Beng was ascertained to be Mr Zulkifli_).

Q4:What “barang”

A4“Barang” refers to 0.5g of “Ice”. Amad wanted 0.5 g of Ice from “Beng”.

Q5:What is this (Mr Shahidin is shown seized items)

A5:This is the “Ice” that I helped Amad order from “Beng”.

Q6;What is it for?

A6:It is for Amad.

Q7:How much does Amad give to you?

A7: **_I quoted him_** 0.5g at $70-80.

Q8:Who did you order the packet of “Ice” from?

A8:I ordered it from “Beng” for Amad.

Q9:How many times have you helped Amad order “Ice” through “Beng”?

A9:I **_helped Amad two times to order “Ice” from “Beng”._**

Q10:What do you get in return for helping Amad to order “Ice’?

A10:“**_Beng” would pay me with a pack of cigarettes_**.

\[_Emphasis added_\]

### Evidence of PW3; CNB FORT officer Koh Kok Sim

9       Forensics Specialist Koh Soon Sim from the CNB Forensics Response Team (FORT) gave evidence that he had undertaken a data extraction exercise of Mr Shahidin’s Samsung mobile device, and had produced a report which was admitted into the proceedings[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) Mr Koh indicated that the mobile phone forensic processing system had extracted information relating to calls, and _WhatsApp_ messages that Mr Shahidin’s Sumsung phone had logged on 2 of August 2016. Among the calls made had been _WhatsApp_ calls to a phone number XXX, to an individual listed in the call records as **_Amad (Jenggo_**), which was the number of a certain Mohamad Fadli Bin Abubakar (PW4).

10     The FORT report of calls and messages logged in Mr Shahidin’s Samsung, while incomplete as a result of limitations in the data extraction process[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17), were nevertheless, in these proceedings, an essential means to **_counter-check_** against another set of records documenting calls and messages between Mr Fadli, and the person using Mr Shahidin’s mobile device, after Mr Fadli’s arrest and co-option to work with a CNB officer; Sgt Norjansher Shah Bin Misnan (PW5) to bring in his drug supplier.

### Evidence of PW4; Mohamad Fadli Bin Abubakar

11     The prosecution’s principal witness at trial was Mohamad Fadli Bin Abubakar. Mr Fadli testified that Mr Shahidin, who was known to Mr Fadli as “Din”, was his **_only_** _Ice_ supplier. It is pertinent to note that Fadli was less than keen to undertake the role of being a prosecution witness in these proceedings, and only attended after a warrant having been taken against him[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18). Once on the stand however, Mr Fadli was forthright in giving a candid account of his relationship and dealings with Mr Shahidin. Mr Fadli informed the court that he had bought _Ice_ from Mr Shahidin on at least two previous occasions. On 2 August 2016, Mr Fadli had made his final order of _Ice_ with Mr Shahidin, upon instructions by CNB officers, after his earlier arrest. In this follow-up operation, Mr Shahidin and Mr Zulkifli had been arrested.

### Background history and prior dealings between Mr Fadli and Mr Shahidin

12     Mr Fadli, who was the principal factual witness in the prosecution’s case, indicated that he had known Mr Shahidin (or ‘Din’) and that the two men had been acquainted since childhood, having previously played soccer together as they lived near each other.

13     After he was made aware by friends that Mr Shahidin was selling _Ice_, Mr Fadli had, in July 2016, begun buying _Ice_ from Mr Shahidin. Mr Fadli revealed that Mr Shahidin’s mobile phone number had been in the contact list of his phone as “_Din Bomb”_.

14     Mr Fadli’s evidence in the manner of his dealings with Mr Shahidin, whom he habitually referred to in court under the moniker ‘_Din_’, is especially cogent. A salient portion of his testimony is therefore reproduced below[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19):

### Fadli’s claim to not personally know Zulkifli

15     As a significant point in the prosecution’s case, Mr Fadli identified Mr Shahidin as his sole supplier of drugs, and **_did not even know_** Mr Zulkifli, the acknowledged supplier of the drugs that Mr Fadli had been implicated from, nor had he never communicated with any person who identified by that name. Indeed, Mr Shahidin had never told him to contact any other person in the process of Mr Fadli’s procurement of _Ice._

16     Mr Fadli did, however, recall collecting his drug purchase from a dark complexioned man[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) in a prior transaction (which was the second of two such transactions before Mr Fadli’s arrest), who **_could_** have been Mr Zulkifli. Mr Shahidin had not introduced this individual, and Mr Fadli had never communicated with this person then or subsequently. Salient parts of his testimony in this aspect is as follows[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21):

Q **_Now, Mr Fadli…do you know anyone called Muhammad Zulkifli Bin Syed Ali?_**

A **_I don’t know._**

Q **_Have you every communicated with anyone with this name?_**

A **_No._**

QAnd have you ever bought Ice from anyone with this name?

ANo. Maybe, the person that the second I meet, right, it may be him that’s him or---I don’t know who’s that person.

QBut you don’t know for sure that this is---

AYah, I don’t know.

Q **_And, earlier, you said that you have never communicated directly with the person who met you that time._**

A **_Yah._**

QYou confirm that?

AYes.

17     After his co-option on 2 August 2016, Mr Fadli had been instructed by CNB officers to contact the person he bought drugs from, after his own arrest. Mr Fadli in his court testimony confirmed that the record of communications prepared by Sgt Norjansher, who had been beside Mr Fadli during his communications with Mr Shahidin) to be an accurate reflection of several calls and _WhatApp_ messages that he had stated to be with Mr Shahidin in the afternoon of 2 August 2016. This aspect of the evidence will be set out, and discussed later in these grounds.

### How Mr Fadli’s testimony, and arising circumstantial evidence, fit into the prosecution’s case theory

18     To allow a better appreciation of the significance of Mr Fadli’s testimony in respect of these interactions, it would be apposite to briefly state Mr Shahidin’s position in defending against the proceeded possession for purpose of trafficking charge. Mr Shahidin did **_not_** deny that Mr Fadli had contacted him to buy _Ice_ on 2 August 2016. His position at trial was that he (Mr Shahidin) had **_merely directed_** Mr Fadli to Mr Zulkifli, who was the actual drug supplier, and that he had no further involvement in Mr Fadli’s order for methamphetamine from that point.

19     The prosecution sought to show that Mr Fadli’s account of his interactions with Din was entirely consistent with their case that while Mr Shahidin did not control his own store of drugs, he nevertheless fulfilled a **_middleman_** role between Mr Fadli and Mr Zulkifli[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22). The prosecution’s case was therefore that while Mr Fadli never dealt directly with Mr Zulkifli (since the Ice sold to him (Mr Fadli) actually came from Mr Zulkifli), this was because the buyer and supplier had been brought together by Mr Shahidin assuming a merchant role. This middleman was **_not uncompensated_** as Mr Zulkifli would, according to recorded statements[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23), reward Mr Shahidin with a tangible, if somewhat meagre, recompense such as a packet of cigarettes, for taking Mr Fadli’s orders of _Ice_, and (in this instance at least) co-ordinating the delivery.

20     The prosecution’s case[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24), bolstered by PW$’s testimony and the call and message records, was essentially that after receiving the call from Mr Fadli, Mr Shahidin would check with Mr Zulkifli to see if he had the amount of _Ice_ that Mr Fadli had asked for. Mr Shahidin had then **_continued to liaise_** with Mr Fadli via his mobile phone number XXX, to arrange for the collection of the order.

21     The prosecution had averred to a close co-operative relationship between the two in pursuance of this transaction with Mr Fadli. The prosecution’s case was that in the afternoon preceding the time of the rendezvous with Mr Fadli, Mr Shahidin had assisted Mr Zulkifli in packing the packet of _Ice_ in Mr Shahidin’s room, as this was facilitated by scavenging plastic bags and boxes from Mr Shahidin’s **_own_** residence to use as packaging. Mr Shahidin and Mr Zulkifli then proceeded downstairs to the void deck via lift to meet Mr Fadli. At some point, Mr Zulkifli had been the one holding on to the red plastic bag containing Mr Fadli’s order of Ice. Upon reaching the ground floor, the two men had been arrested by CNB officers.

### Accused’s section 22 Criminal Procedure Code Statement

22     Mr Shahidin’s statement was admitted as part of the prosecution’s case[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) after he had confirmed that it had been voluntarily provided. A close reading shows Mr Shahidin’s role to be considerably greater than his characterisation at trial of being a generally disinterested party who merely referred Mr Fadli to Mr Zulkifli to purchase his drug supply. The salient parts of the statement are set out.

2.    On 02 August 2016 (Tuesday), at around 1815hrs, I was arrested together with friend[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26), (Mr Muhammad Zulkifi Bin Syed Ali, NRIC No: XXX) by a party of officers who identified themselves as CNB officers inside the lift at the ground floor lobby at Blk 402, Hougang Ave 10, # XXX. The party of CNB officers arrested us when we are about to walk out from the lift. We were immediately handcuffed by the CNB officers inside the lift. The party of CNB officers escorted us out from the lift and a body search was conducted on me. Nothing incriminating was seized from me. A body search was also conducted on (Mr Zulkifli) by CNB officers. I overheard that a packet of "Ice" was seized by CNB officers.

3.    After the body search was conducted on me, the same party of CNB officers escorted me to my unit at level seven and conducted house search inside the room that my family is renting. Nothing incriminating was seized from the room search…

7.    On 02 August 2016 (Tuesday), at around 1200hrs, I met up with (Mr Zulkifli) at the vicinity of Serangoon North. We took bus to Fahrenheit clinic located at 218 Bedok Street 1. At around 1500hrs, (Mr Zulkifli) companied me to consult doctor. At around 1500hrs plus, I received a call from (Mr Fadli)[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)**_I know_** (Mr Fadli) **_since year 2004 through_** (Mr Fadli’s) **_older brother. He asked me if my side have "Ice" or not._** (Mr Fadli) **_requested for 0.5 gram of "Ice". I told him that I will check and update him again later. After the call conversation, I checked with_** (Mr Zulkifli) **_if he had supply for 0.5 gram of "Ice", I called back (_**Mr Fadli) **_using my hand phone to inform him that I had supply for 0.5 gram of "Ice" which was from_** (Mr Zulkifli). (Mr Fadli) informed me to meet at serangoon Blk 101 at 7pm. After the consultation of doctor, I together with (Mr Zulkifli) went back to my residential at Hougang to play computer games.

8.    At around 1700hrs plus, (Mr Fadli) messaged me and informed that he will be heading down to "7-11" located at Blk 401 Hougang to get 0.5gram of "Ice" from (Mr Zulkifli). I informed (Mr Zulkifli) that (Mr Fadli) is on the way down to collect the 0.5 gram of "Ice". Inside my room, I witnessed (Mr Zulkifli) packing one packet of "Ice”… I witnessed (Mr Zulkifli) taking a packet of "Ice" into an empty packet of green colour "PALL MALL" cigarette box[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28). I did not noticed (_sic_) where he took out the packet of "Ice" from. This empty packet of green colour "PALL MALL" cigarette box belonged to me. I am a smoker and only smoke green colour "PALL MALL" cigarettes. My house has many empty packets of "PALL MALL" cigarettes boxes. After placing the packet of "Ice" into the "PALL MALL" cigarette box, he placed the cigarette box into a red colour plastic bag[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29). He then placed the red colour plastic bag into an empty Bluetooth headset box[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30). After that, he placed this empty Bluetooth headset box into a red colour plastic bag. The two red colour plastic bags[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31), and also the empty Bluetooth headset box. I confirmed that the packet of "Ice"[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) does not belonged(sic) to me. I do not have any knowledge of this packet of "Ice", I only know is from (Mr Zulkifli). I confirmed never touch this packet of "Ice" before. This packet of "Ice" belonged to (Mr Zulkifli).

9.    After (Mr Zulkifli) finished packing the packet of "Ice", we took lift and went down together to meet (Mr Fadli), (Mr Zulkifli) was holding on to the red colour plastic bag containing one packet of "Ice". Once we landed at the ground floor, both of us were arrested by CNB officers.

10.    This is the second time that I helping (Mr Fadli) to order from (Mr Zulkifli), The first time that I help (Mr Fadli) to order through (Mr Zulkifli) was earlier last month. I am unable to recall the actual date. (Mr Fadli) contacted me through phone to place the order on the first occasion. That is the first time I arranged both of them meet up. I relay the messages to both of them to meet up at Serangoon North Blk 101. The reason why I think this time (02 August 2016) he contacted me and placed order through me is because he was unable to get through (Mr Zulkifli) himself. (Mr Fadli) knew that most of the time me and (Mr Zulkifli) will be together as we are working in the company as store-man. Prior to the meet up with (Mr Fadli), (Mr Zulkifli) agreed to buy for me one (01) packet of cigarette. (Mr Fadli) is the only person that I introduced (Mr Zulkifli) to, (Mr Fadli) already knew the price for the packet of 0.5 gram of "Ice" as both (Mr Zulkifli) and (Mr Fadli) transacted before. The price for the packet of 0.5 gram of "Ice" should be roughly _S$70_ to _S$80._ The first time, (Mr Zulkifli) sold to (Mr Fadli) for 0.5 gram of "Ice" for the price of around _$70_ to _$80._ I not sure how many times both of them meet each other after I introduce to both of them.

11.    I have no knowledge of where (Mr Zulkifli) got his supply of "Ice" from. That all. \[_Emphasis added_\]

### Fadli’s account of the operation on 2 August 2016 to lure out his supplier

23     Mr Fadli had been arrested with drug paraphernalia earlier at Toa Payoh that day as he was heading home to his after dropping his children off to school[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33). He had admitted to consuming drugs, and Mr Shahidin’s number had been listed in his seized mobile phone, under the appellation _‘Din Bomb’_. Mr Fadli had been using his phone at the time of his arrest[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34), which had aroused interest in the mobile device among the arresting officers. He had then been asked to co-operate in an operation against his supplier by way of a staged purchase of a quantity of methamphetamine. Mr Fadli could not remember the name of the officer he was required to work with in this enterprise, but recalled that he was heavy-set, bearded, and had Malay features, which were attributes consistent with the appearance of PW5 Sgt Norjansher Shah Misnan[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35).

### Evidence of CNB Sgt Norjansher

24     Mr Muhammad Norjansher Shah Bin Misnan, a six-year veteran of the Central Narcotics Bureau, had recorded Fadli’s statement at the Tanglin CNB premises, after his arrest. The recording session commenced after Mr Fadli’s urine test results were known. Both men were seated during the process, and Mr Fadli had reportedly been forthright in disclosing his drug activities. He had stated when he had last smoked _Ice_ and where he obtained the _Ice_ from[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36), which prompted Sgt Norjansher to formulate a plan lure out Mr Fadli’s supplier[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37):

QSo where did Mr Fadli say he got the Ice from?

AHe said he got the Ice from his friend, known to him as Din.

…

QSo did you give any instructions to Mr Fadli after he told you that?

AYes.

QWhat instructions did you give him?

AI asked him if it was possible to lure Din.

### Modus operandi for luring ‘Din’ with a staged purchase

25     In the process of luring out ‘Din’, Sgt Norjansher learnt that Mr Fadli’s usual order[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) from Din was $30 worth of Ice. He thus instructed him to call ‘Din’ to order $30 of Ice. Mr Fadli had made the call, and spoke on Malay. Din responded to the call, and started a chain of communications by call and _WhatsApp_ text. During these calls, the mobile phone was not placed on speaker mode, and Sgt Norjansher did not hear the voice of the person Mr Fadli was speaking to, nor the content of the message from that person. Sgt Norjansher had waited for Mr Fadli put down the phone, before inquiring on that aspect of the conversation, and recording this on a piece of paper[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39).

### The transcript of exchanges between Fadli and ‘Din’

26     Sgt Norjansher produced a table which detailed no fewer than 38 separate call and text transactions between Mr Fadli on his mobile phone, and the individual using Mr Shahidin’s mobile phone (XXX) between 2.39 pm and 7.08 pm on 2 August 2016. It is beyond dispute that Mr Shahidin and Mr Zulkifli were arrested shortly after the penultimate message at 6.13 pm (at serial number 36). The final message by Mr Fadli at 7.08 pm, was sent post-arrest, where he, being reportedly held at the CNB branch in Tanglin, appears seemingly unaware of ground events at the scene of arrest in Hougang.

27     The text messages were primarily in Malay, with frequent abbreviated usages, with serial number 7 of a single word response in English of _‘Roger’_ being a standout from this pattern of communication. **_‘Din’_** was established to be the nickname Mr Fadli used for the accused; Mr Shahidin. While Mr Shahidin would later claim that he was not using his phone, it is notable that Mr Fadli addresses **_‘Din’_** at serial number 10, and there is no subsequent rebuttal or clarification in the stream of test messages that Mr Fadli was texting and speaking to anyone other than **_‘Din’_**.

28     Sgt Norjansher indicated that entries 1, 2, 13 and 30 involved mobile phone calls, while the remaining 34 entries were WhatsApp messages. Starting from serial number 3, which was sent from ‘Din’ to Mr Fadli, Mr Fadli would show Sgt Norjansher each successive message on the screen of his mobile phone. Sgt Norajnsher would use his own mobile phone and take a photo[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) of the conversation from Fadli’s phone, and transcribe these messages. With a view to luring ‘Din’ for apprehension, Sgt Norjansher would tell Mr Fadli exactly what to reply to Din, giving him a level of discretion in composing his message rather than forcing him to follow an exact word-for-word script. In transcribing, Sgt Norjansher would type out the Malay conversation first, and then translate[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42) the messages to English at the bottom of the Malay sentence using a bracket to distinguish between the two texts. Sgt Norjansher professed to be fluent in the Malay language as Malay had been his mother tongue, and a language that he had continued to use conversationally, Sgt Norjansher’s formal education in that language had extended to his GCE O-levels[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43). To facilitate the operation, starting at serial number 29, Sgt Norjansher told Mr Fadli that he had to buy time at this juncture. After learning from Mr Fadli that there was a 7-Eleven store in the vicinity, he had caused Mr Fadli to send a message to ‘Din’ that “I am stopping at the back. I am going to buy chocolate for my son at 7-Eleven.”

### Incongruity with FORT report

29     Sgt Norjansher was asked by DPP Teong to clarify the entry in serial number 2 which Sgt Norjansher had documented to be a call **_by_** ‘Din’ **_to_** Mr Fadli. This had differed from an extraction report from the CNB’s Forensic Response Team of Mr Shahidin’s phone which appeared to show that the call had been made at 3.45 pm by Mr Fadli (who was listed in Mr Shahidin’s phone as _Amad (Jenggo_)) **_to_** ‘Din’. A previous witness; PW3 Forensic Expert Koh Soon Kim had in his FORT report documented the call received from ‘_Amad (Jenggo)’_ (Mr Fadli’s phone) on the 2 August 2016 at 1545 with the annotation “_Recorded a call on the 2nd of August 2016 at 1545 hours_.”[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) On whether ‘Din’ had called Mr Fadli or vice versa in that instance, Sgt Norjansher was candid in conceding that he ‘_could not recall who called who at that point of time_’ but could remember substance of the conversation, which was to set the rendezvous point for ‘Din’ to pass Mr Fadli the Ice.

### The Defence Case, accused as sole witness and not calling evidence of Zulkifli

30     Mr Shahidin, who elected to give evidence on his own behalf, was the sole defence witness. Mr Zulkifli, who had fled at the beginning of trial, had been apprehended[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45) by the time the prosecution closed its case. Mr Zulklifli was offered as a defence witness, but Mr Shahidin had eschewed calling Mr Zulkifli to bolster his case. This was after counsel had been given the opportunity to interview Mr Zulkifli, who had been held in remand after his arrest.

31     Given this election by defence counsel, the inevitable impression would be that Mr Zulkifli would not have been inclined to say anything which would be favourable to Mr Shahidin’s defence. Otherwise, if one operated on the premise that Mr Zulkifli supported Mr Shahidin’s account, Mr Zulkifli might would have been a key pillar to prop Mr Shahidin’s contention that there had been no common intention between the two to traffic the packet of _Ice_ to Mr Fadli with Mr Zulkifli.

32     Mr Shahidin did concede that Mr Fadli had ordered Ice from him more than once; but claimed that he had simply directed Mr Fadli to Mr Zulkifli, by giving Mr Zulkifli’s number to Mr Fadli whenever Mr Fadli contacted him to buy _Ice_. The _modus operandi_ described by Mr Shahidin, would have Mr Zulkifli and Mr Fadli communicate directly, after his provision of the number, and he had no further involvement with Mr Fadli’s orders of _Ice_ beyond this initial go-between contact. Mr Shahidin categorically denied any intent to meet Mr Fadli to hand drugs to him.

### Accused’s testimony at trial

33     Mr Shahidin repeated the account in his statement that he had known Mr Fadli through his association with Mr Fadli’s elder brother, who was a childhood friend. He had played soccer with Mr Fadli’s brother as both had lived in close proximity. Mr Shahidin denied being particularly close to Mr Fadli stating [\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46):

QAre you in talking terms with Fadli?

AUh, no. I don’t really know him, ah.

### Events on 2 August 2016

34     On 2 August 2016, Mr Shahidin had met Mr. Zulkifli in Bedok, where Mr Zulkifli had accompanied him for a medical consultation at a certain Fahrenheit Clinic. After meeting Mr. Zulkifli at this clinic, Mr Shahidin had received a call from Mr Fadli. Mr Shahdin’s evidence was that Mr Fadli had asked to purchase drugs, and Mr Shahidin had simply passed the phone to Mr Zulkifli to make arrangements, and leaving the two to sort out the pertinent details of the order and rendezvous. He states[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47):

QYou received a call from Fadli?

AYah.

QOkay. What was the purpose of this call?

AHe want to find this thing, ah.

QFind what?

AThe drug, ah. He was asking, ah, at---

QSo he was asking you. What was your reply to that?

AI passed to the---my phone---passed---I passed to Zulkifli.

QAnd why did you pass it to Zulkifli?

AYour Honour, he actually---actually they know each other, but he doesn’t have the Zulkifli contact number.

QOh, I see. So from then until your arrest, did you communicate with---

AOnly on the first time when I answer the call, lah, just to pass my phone to Mr. Zulkifli.

QAfter that, you did not speak to---

ANo.

QMr. Fadli?

ANo.

QNow from there, where did you go to?

AI went back to my house.

QSo from Bedok, went back to Hougang.

35     After receiving his medical certificate, Mr Shahidin had returned to his apartment in Hougang, and been engrossed in computer games until he had been distracted by Mr Zulkifli, who had asked for a cigarette box or other suitable receptacle. After Mr Shahidin had provided him with a Pall Mall cigarette box, Mr Zulkifli ‘packed the thing’[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48).

36     Mr Shahidin indicated that there was nothing remarkable about the Pall Mall cigarette box, as it was one of about a hundred empty cigarette boxes that had accumulated un-discarded in his apartment after he had smoked the contents. Mr Shahidin conceded to being aware that Mr Zulkifli was involved in the supply of illicit drugs, but professed not to know the nature or scale of his activities[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49).

37     Summing up the above, the gist of Mr Shahidin’s own account of the sequence of events on 2 August 2016 is a concession that Mr Fadli had called him on his mobile phone to order _Ice_. Dissociating himself from any active facilitation, he states however, that Mr Fadli had only called him because he **_could not get through_** to Mr Zulkifli, as Mr Zulkifli tended to change his number frequently. As Mr Shahidin was in Mr Zulkifli’s presence at that point in time, he had simply passed his mobile phone for Mr Fadli to speak directly to Mr Zulkifli.

38     Mr Shahidin’s case was that aside from the first time he answered Mr Fadli’s call, he did not communicate or speak to Mr Fadli at all. In relation to _WhatsApp_ messages, his case was that **_Mr Zulkifli_** was the one who used his mobile phone to exchange messages with Mr Fadli in the afternoon of 2 August 2016[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50). Mr Zulkifli had then, on his own accord, processed the order by packing the sachet of _Ice_ using the boxes and plastic bags from the house.

39     It is, in my view noteworthy that the crucial point of Mr Zulkifli taking over all practical aspects of the interactions, runs starkly against Mr Fadli’s account in Court. From the record, it appears that the notion of Mr Fadli speaking or messaging someone else[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) other than Mr Shahidin was never put to him[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52). Counsel’s ‘put’ question was rather that ‘_no calls received by you from the accused’s handphone’[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53)_. Neither Mr Shahidin’s statements to the CNB P9 or P10 raised this aspect of Mr Zulkifli handling the direct communications with Mr Fadli.

### Difference in testimony on whether Shahidin received payment

40     Rather surprisingly, Mr Shahidin’s court testimony differed from his original account from the statements recorded by the CNB officers in respect of whether he had received payments from Mr Zulkifli. Where he was referred to question 10 of the contemporaneous statement P9, Mr Shahidin was asked what he would get in return for helping (Mr Zulkifli) to order ice, he stated unequivocally that he did not receive any payment at all[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54):

A **_He give me nothing, ah_**.

QHe give you nothing.

A **_Yah, the thing is I’m not really like, helping him doing something. I just pass the number to him._**

Q **_So that’s---what you’re saying is there’s no payment by way of a packet of cigarette._**

A **_Yah, no._**

QFor helping ‘Ahmad’.

ANo.

QAnd then why did you say this in the statement?

AI cannot remember, eh.

QHmm?

AI cannot remember.

QWhy you can’t remember? _\[Emphasis added\]_

41     Mr Shahidin gives a surprisingly flippant answer that he could not remember why he had alluded to the in-kind payment of a packet of cigarettes. He attributed his memory lapse to his being on medication expressing himself that ‘**_I not sure, maybe I on medication or what. Because I go doctor, mah.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)’_**

### Assessment of the quality of evidence given by PW4 Fadli

42     In court, Mr Fadli appeared to be forthright in his testimony. Mr Fadli did not appear to bear any ill-will against Mr Shahidin, stating that he did not harbour any grudges against him, nor had any reason to implicate Mr Shahidin[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56). Mr Fadli indeed couched his dealings with Mr Shahidin in rather euphemistic terms. Mr Fadli seemed reluctant to describe Mr Shahidin as a “seller” of _Ice_, but framed his dealings with Mr Shahidin to say rather diplomatically that Mr Shahidin _helped_ him to get _Ice_, although Mr Fadli would make a payment to him for this supply. Mr Fadli stated explicitly that Mr Shahidin had indicated affirmatively that “he can get for him” when he asked him whether he was selling _Ice_. Mr Fadli was also circumspect in clarifying that Mr Shahidin was not the “supplier” who maintained his own store, but that he had to get the _Ice_ from another individual who was not known to him. Mr Fadli was also a witness who condescended to details, mentioning an instance of having collected his order of Ice from someone apart from Mr Shahidin on a previous occasion. He therefore seemed to be a creditworthy witness, who would be unlikely to fudge or gloss over significant details in his evidence.

43     It is also noteworthy that Mr Fadli had **_identified_** Mr Shahidin to be the supplier of his methamphetamine from the point of his arrest, and it was this disclosure which had precipitated the sting-type operation to arrest Mr Shahidin by having him call Mr Shahidin for a fresh supply.

44     It is also significant, in my view that Mr Fadli’s evidence is entirely congruent with **_extrinsic evidence_** presented at in the course of the prosecution’s case. The body of extrinsic evidence which corroborated Mr Fadli’s account included the record of communications prepared by Sgt Norjansher from a contemporaneous record of the communications between Mr Fadli and the person believed to be Mr Shahidin on 2 August 2016. Mr Fadli had proceeded in the sting operation without any pause or giving any indication that he was speaking and messaging to Mr Shahidin, a person he had known from his youth. It would have been unlikely, in my view, for a person experiencing the stress and tension of a recent arrest to fail to flag to his CNB controllers that he talking to Mr Zulkifli on 2 August 2016, rather than the person targeted for the operation, namely Mr Shahidin.

45     Sgt Norjansher’s evidence also corroborates Mr Fadli’s evidence, in recalling that Mr Fadli had stated that he had obtained _Ice_ from his friend known to him as “Din” shortly after his arrest.

46     Another component which has featured a Forensic Response Team (FORT) report which showed calls and some of the _WhatsApp_ messages exchanged between Mr Fadli and the person on Mr Shahidin’s mobile phone on 2 August 2016. Although not all of the messages detailed in the record of communications were found in the FORT report. PW3 Koh Soon Sim has explained that the forensic software could not uncover all messages due to technical limitations. There was also no means to physically examine or catalogue the stored messages on Mr Shahidin’s phone, as the extant Whatsapp application had been rendered obsolete, and no updating could be undertaken, as the data would be contaminated.

### Analysis of Mr Shahidin’s account

47     Conversely. Mr Shahidin’s account of Mr Zulkifli using his (Mr Shahidin’s) mobile phone to liaise with Mr Fadli on 2 August 2016 is problematic. There does not seem to be any dispute from any account that Mr Zulkifli **_had_** his own mobile phone with him at that time. Mr Shahidin’s account was that Mr Zulkifli had simply appropriated his (Mr Shahidin’s) phone to talk to Mr Fadli, while Mr Shahidin was inside the clinic. He had left to speak to Mr Fadli, while Mr Shahidin remained in the clinic, and thus did not follow their conversation. After the conversation, Mr Zulkifli had held on to the phone, until Mr Shahidin had asked for phone back. Mr Zulkifli had regained possession of the hand phone after they had returned, taking it in Mr Shahidin’s room without asking Mr Shahidin’s permission to send messages to Mr Fadli. Mr Shahidin had never asked Mr Zulkifli why he had to use Mr Shahidin’s phone. Mr Shahidin’s evidence is as follows:

QOkay. So ‘Beng’[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) held on to your phone the whole afternoon and you didn’t ask him why he needed your phone?

ANo.

QDid you ask him what he need to use your phone for?

ANo.

…

QSo you assumed that ‘Beng’ was using your phone to communicate with Fadli?

AYes.

QAnd you only got your phone back before you went downstairs with ‘Beng’?

AYes.

48     Mr Shahidn’s evidence was that Mr Zulkifli had left the phone on the bed, and that he had retrieved it just before going down for the rendezvous with Mr Fadli,

### Whether Shahidin had simply handed Fadli’s call to Zulklifli

49     Mr Shahidin had seemed keen to disavow himself from all dealings with Mr Fadli’s order after the initial call. There is, however, no cogent explanation why he had not simply informed Mr Zulkifli that Mr Fadli wished to place an order of _Ice_, and then leave this to Mr Zulkifli to follow through with Mr Fadli via his own means. Even if Mr Zulkifli did not have Mr Fadli’s number, Mr Shahidin could have easily provided this to him as Mr Fadli had been saved in his mobile phone contact list as “_Amad Jenggo_”

50     Mr Shahidin’s account was that Mr Fadli had specifically asked him for Mr Zulkifli’s phone number when he called him on 2 August 2016. He states as follows to DPP Theong’s cross-examination[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58):

QOkay. Now when Fadli called you asking for Ice on the 2nd of August, he didn’t ask to speak to ‘Beng[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59)’, right?

AHe ask me for ‘Beng’ number and then he ask me for Ice.

QBut then you just passed the phone to ‘Beng’ directly, right?

ABecause he is beside me.

Q **_At the time ‘Beng’ had his own phone, right?_**

A **_Uh, yes._**

QAnd at the time you already had the number he was using at the time, right?

AYes.

QSo you could have just given ‘Beng’s’ new number to Fadli, like what you said you did the first time around, right?

AThe first time I was not with him.

51     Notwithstanding Mr Zulkifli’s alleged habit of changing phone numbers frequently[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60), Mr Shahidin already had Mr Zulkifli’s extant number at that point in time. Nothing should therefore have stopped Mr Shahidin from **_giving_** Mr Zulkifli’s number to Mr Fadli, which was his purported _modus operandi_ in a previous occasion[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61) when Mr Fadli called him to place an order for _Ice_. In Mr Shahidin’s own words ‘… **_the second time is I passed my phone to_** (Zulkifli), **_the first time I give_** (Zulkifli’s) **_number to_** (Fadli)’

52     There hence does not seem to be a rational basis for Mr Shahidin to have yielded his mobile phone to Mr Zulkifli for the whole afternoon, when he could have given Mr Fadli Mr Zulkifli’s current number to facilitate direct communications. Mr Shahidin’s cryptic explanation that he did not give Mr Zulkifli’s number on 2 August 2016 is **_that ‘I assume..that he doesn’t want to give his number_**, **_ah_**’ does not serve as a coherent explanation, because there is nothing to indicate that Mr Zulkifli had objected to Mr Shahidin giving his number to Mr Fadli previously[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62).

53     Ultimately, I agree with the prosecution’s submission that Mr Shahidin’s defence appears somewhat **_internally_** inconsistent[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63) in the sense of his (Mr Shahidin) never mentioning that Mr Zulkifli was using his mobile phone on 2 August 2016 in either of his statements P9 or P10. Mr Shahidin’s variant of the events then had him play a central co-ordinating role,[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64) including the revelation that _he_ was the one who had called Mr Fadli back using his mobile phone to inform him that he could get the _Ice_ that ordered[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65), and his account has Mr Fadli messaging _him_ (rather than Mr Zulkifli) at the point when he was **_‘on the way down’_** to collect his order.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66) Another telling detail was the message from Mr Fadli at 5.33 am stating[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67)**_‘Din, is it possible if I meet at your place’._** Mr Shahidin is referred to by his nickname but if Mr Zulkifli had indeed been using the phone, it is surprising that he never seeks to correct Mr Fadli.

54     Defence counsel’s decision not to call Mr Zulkifli to take the stand was certainly a missed opportunity to clarify the rather significant controversies over who had possession of the mobile phone, and the nature and extent of that person’s communications with Mr Fadli. As mentioned before, Mr Zulkifli had been arrested by the time that defence was called, and counsel had been afforded an opportunity to interview him.

### Analysis of evidence

55     The prosecution has proceeded with a single charge under section 5(1)(_a_) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed); which provides as follows:

**Trafficking in controlled drugs**

**5.– (1**)    Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore — (_a_) to traffic in a controlled drug…

(2)    For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.

In the context of this case, section 2 of the MDA, which defines the act of trafficking to encompass **_delivery_**, would apply.

56     Salient areas of this aspect of trafficking under s 5(1)(_a_) read with s 5(2) of the MDA have been reiterated in the recent decision of the High Court in **_Public Prosecutor v Ranjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh and another_** at \[34\] which elucidated on principles set by the Court of Appeal in **_Muhammad Ridzuan Bin Md Ali v PP and other matters_**

In **_Ranjit Singh_**, Hoo Sheau Peng J states

34    In respect of a charge of trafficking under s 5(1) read with s 5(2) of the MDA (as faced by Farid), the elements to be established are (a) **_possession of the drugs_**; (b) **_knowledge of the nature of the drugs_**; and (c) **_proof that possession of the drugs was for the purpose of trafficking_** which was not authorised: _Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v PP_ (“_Muhammad Ridzuan_”) at \[59\]. \[_Emphasis added_\]

57     In this case Mr Shahidin had been jointly charged with Mr Zulkifli for trafficking in furtherance of a common intention, as provided under s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (**PC**) which implicates any criminal act done by several persons, in furtherance of a common intention of all, with criminal liable for that act in the same manner as if the act had been done by him alone.

### Defence submissions

58     Defence counsel; Mr Jayakumar Naidu, sought to undermine the prosecution’s case by pointing out that there had been a paucity of **_physical_** evidence implicating Mr Shahidin with a direct role in the crime. Counsel pointed out that ‘nothing incriminating’[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) had been found on Mr Shahidin’s person at the time of arrest, or in his apartment, which was searched in the wake of the arrest. Mr Jayakumar emphasized that search had not uncovered any _‘sachet or weighing scale which are synonymous with the trafficking trade’_.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69) The fact that the Bluetooth and Pall Mall cigarette boxed containing Mr Shahidin’s DNA would not necessarily implicate his client, as the items had been sourced from Mr Shahidin’s room, and the DNA could have been the result of DNA transfer from prior handling by him, before they had been selected to pack the drugs. Significantly, in this regard, the _sachet_ of crystalline substance, which was later determined to be methamphetamine, did not contain any DNA from Mr Shahidin. He reiterated the defence was simply Mr Shahidin merely ‘helping’ Mr Fadli to order _Ice_ from Mr Zulkifli on 2 August 2016. And that Mr Shahidin had never alluded to personally dealing with narcotic substances[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70).

59     Given the situation above, it was incumbent on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Shahidin and Mr Zulkifli had the common intention to traffick the quantity of methamphetamine to Mr Fadli. Mr Jayakumar also noted that the presumption under s17[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) of the MDA did not apply given the quantity was too low to trigger the presumption. The learned DPP countered that her case was instead premised on her reliance on the presumption under s18(4)[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72) of the MDA.

### Elements of common intention

60     The elements of common intention were referenced in the **_Ridzuan_** where the Court of Appeal stated at \[34\]:

34    The applicable law in so far as s 34 PC is concerned has been set out in the decision of (_Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan_ v PP ). **_Three elements_** must be present before constructive liability can be imposed pursuant to s 34 PC, namely: (a) **_the criminal act element_** (“a criminal act”); (b) **_the common intention element_** (“in furtherance of the common intention of all”) and (c) **_the participation element_** (“a criminal act … done by several persons”)…

61     The concept of constructive responsibility is expounded on by the Court of Appeal in **_Ridzuan_** as follows:

27    …The purpose of s 34 PC is to impute _constructive_ liability on a secondary offender in relation to an offence arising from a criminal act committed by the actual doer in furtherance of the common intention shared by the actual doer and the secondary offender …

62     Hence, in a case of trafficking in furtherance of a common intention, should all the elements of trafficking be made out against the ‘actual doer’, and, it is proven beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of s 34 of the Penal Code are fulfilled, constructive liability for trafficking would be imposed on the secondary offender. The elements for trafficking need not be additionally made out against the secondary offender (_per_ \[29\] of **_Ridzuan_**). In this context, Mr Zulkifli would be the ‘primary’ offender, being in direct physical possession of the methamphetamine, while Mr Shahidin has been charged in a factual matrix where he is accused of being the ‘secondary’ offender.

63     Of the three elements, the **_criminal act_** element, which collectively references the acts done by the primary offender (the ‘actual doer’) and secondary offender amounting to the charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking (_Ridzuan_ at \[35\]), which extends to acts done from receiving Mr Fadli’s order to Mr Zulkifli being found with the packet of _Ice_ while apparently on his way to meet Mr Fadli, would be clearly fulfilled. It was also clear from Mr Shahidin’s own evidence that both he and Mr Zulkifli were aware that the Pall Mall packet contained the methamphetamine intended for delivery to Mr Fadli for the fulfilment of his order.

64     On the remaining issues, the next issue to be addressed would be the question of Mr Shahidin, the secondary offender, sharing a **_common intention_** with Mr Zulkifli to possess the _Ice_ for the purpose of trafficking to Mr Fadli. Notably the _Ice_ had been packed in Mr Shahidin’s apartment, using Mr Shahidin’s cigarette box.

65     The circumstances, in my judgment, strongly point to Mr Shahidin having known of and consented to Zulkifli’s possession of the packet of Ice, when the two proceeded to meet Fadli. Despite Mr Shahidin’s protestations to the contrary, I am convinced that the communications in P20 did not involve Mr Zulkifli at all as a correspondent, and that the agreement and arrangements for the transaction in respect of the packet of _Ice_ was principally between Mr Shahidin and Mr Fadli.

66     On the consideration of the aspect of common intention, while it is common ground that the _Ice_ came from Mr Zulkifli, Mr Shahidin, from the accumulated evidence, acted as the prime mover in making arrangements for the transaction (by taking Mr Fadli’s order) and the liaison work to facilitate the delivery. It is also significant that Mr Shahidin had _accompanied_ Zulkifli in making the delivery. This is congruent too with Mr Fadli’s evidence that Mr Shahidin had never **_introduced_** Mr Zulkifli to him. It would have therefore been difficult to imagine Mr Fadli being agreeable, much less comfortable to transacting illicit drugs with a practical stranger, even if he had seen a person conforming to Mr Zulkifli’s appearance with Mr Shahidin before. As the amount of drugs had been an extremely small quantity in a sachet, there would have been no need for **_both_** men to hold the drugs. Practicably, only one would do so, and the person was, of course, Mr Zulkifli. He was accordingly the person found with this drugs when the CNB officers executed their arrest at the void deck. Mr Shaidin’s complicity can also be seen in his allowing Mr Zulkifli pack the Ice sachet with multiple layers of packaging from bags and boxes found in his room[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73).

67     It is plain therefore that Mr Shahidin accepted that the transportation of the quantity of _Ice_ was a clandestine operation which required the Ice to be concealed as much as possible from possible detection. From his own account, he allowed the utilisation of resources from his own premises. Within this factual matrix, the intent to convey the drugs to Mr Fadli would be construed be a mutual one.

68     In relation to the third element of participation, **_Ridzuan’s_** case elaborates at \[36\]:

36    Turning to (the participation element), it was emphasised by this court in L_ee Chez Kee v PP_ (“_Lee Chez Kee_”) that participation, not presence, is the key ingredient in imposing liability under s 34 PC and that this is a question of fact to be decided in each case (see _Lee Chez Kee_ at \[146\]). **_The secondary offender satisfies this requirement of participation if he participates in the specific criminal act committed by the actual doer which gives rise to the offence charged or if he participates in some other criminal act that is done in furtherance of the common intention of all the offenders_**, _ie_, he participated in any of the diverse acts which altogether formed the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in the offence charged and that offence was commonly intended by all the offenders…

69     I am satisfied that the element of Mr Shahidin’s **_participation_** in the transaction with Mr Fadli is 2 August 2016 is amply fulfilled from the evidence. Mr Shahidin had received the order and directly quoted the selling price[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74), and liaised with Mr Fadli in respect of the collection time and place. From his account, Mr Zulkifli had taken steps to ‘process’ the order by taking the methamphetamine from his source, and then use the materials from Mr Shahidin’s apartment for the multiple layers of wrapping.

70     The interception by CNB had occurred when the two men had been on their way to meet Mr Fadli, with Mr Shahidin being the **_only one_** of the two men recognised by the former. Given the involvement of Mr Shahidin at multiple critical steps the transaction, Mr Shahidin was a key participant. Even if it may be argued that the person in actual possession of the _Ice_ (ie Mr Zulkifli) would be the one who would be more likely to personally execute the exchange, it was Shahidin who, by his own admission, was in physical possession of his **_mobile phone_** at the time the two left the premises, and thus be in a continued position to co-ordinate the transaction between Mr Fadli and a man he could barely recognise beyond his dark complexion. Considering the number of frenetic messages for timing and directions in the latter part of the transcript P20[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75), it was likely that **_further_** co-ordination would have been required after the duo reached the ground floor, before the transaction could take place, and it was, in my view, far more likely that the person **_holding_** the mobile phone (ie Mr Shahidin himself) to have assumed the continued responsibility to facilitate a successful meet-up and exchange.

### Whether the transcript of calls and messages between Fadli and the accused was reliable

71     Counsel had sought to cast doubt on both accuracy and veracity of the transcript at P20. His submission included the fact that Mr Fadli’s conversation with Mr Shahidin had not been on speaker phone, and thus Sgt Norjahsher did not **_hear_** the actual conversation[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) between the two men. In my view, however, it would have been unrealistic to have the conversation on speakerphone, as doing so would have run the risk of transmitting background noise from Tanglin CNB office, or even Sgt Norjansher’s verbal cues while giving instructions, and possibly arousing Mr Shahidin’s suspicion that he was the subject of a sting operation. On the accuracy of the transcript, Sgt Norjansher gave his account that he had taken screenshots[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77) of the WhatsApp messages, and made written annotations[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78) before he executed the finalised typed transcript of the record of communications some six hours after the communications took place.

72     From this account, it would be clear that Sgt Norjansher had referred from a contemporaneous handwritten record of the conversation, and not merely from his memory, with the attendant risks of fallible recall. Given this, I do not find any basis to doubt the exactness in the transcription of the actual messages. It would, of course, have been ideal if Sgt Norjansher had been prescient enough to have retained his handwritten ‘working papers’ as well as the **_screen-shots_** of Mr Fadli’s mobile phone to resolve all controversies on accuracy, but I accept that he might not have anticipated the defence’s challenge. Without any advance knowledge of a challenge of this nature, it would not be reasonable to expect Sgt Norjansher to keep the images in his phone for the not insignificant duration between 2 August 2016 and 11 April 2018, when he gave his evidence.

73     Defence counsel has highlighted the fact that the FORT report of SHAH-1 did not contain a complete documentation of messages and calls. The FORT officer, Mr Koh Soon Sim, has conceded that forensic software had technical limitations, which inhibited its ability to retrieve messages from Shahidin’s phone, and that only successfully extracted messages were retrieved. Mr Koh could not work any further on Shahidin’s phone, despite the device being in police/CNB hands, as the extant WhatsApp edition had expired, and any attempt to update the application would risk the contamination of the phone’s data, degrading its forensic value.

74     In evaluating the evidence, I accept that there are indeed errors and inconsistencies, the faults appear to be clerical in nature, as I would accept that the entry in the FORT report is more likely to be correct, regarding the call on 2 August 2016 at 3.45 pm, and that it was Mr Fadli who had called Mr Shahidin, and not _vice versa_ as indicated in P20. These minor inroads into the accuracy of the record of communications do very little to stem the far more pervasive impression that the messages are largely correctly recorded. This has been verified by Mr Fadli in his testimony[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79), after he was taken through the contents of P20. Almost all the translations, including vernacular usages and abbreviations have also been certified **_correct_** by PW7, professional interpreter Mohammad Farhan Bin Sani at both a literal and contextual level[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80) Given that P-20 is at least partially supported by forensic analysis of its counterpart device (Mr Shahidin’s phone _vide_ FORT report SHAH-1), attested to in authenticity by PW4; Mr Fadli and PW5; Sgt Norjansher, and assessed to be a faithfully translation by PW7, I would find P20 to be, after excluding the qualifications above, a document of high **_probative value_** of the phone and text interactions that are set out, with the context and contents strongly indicating the communications to be between Mr Fadli and Mr Shahidin.

75     For completeness in assessing the factual matrix of this case, I should highlight that also seems to be a difference between the various parties in their respective accounts of the _price_ of the drugs ordered. Sgt Norjansher had indicated his instructions to Mr Fadli to order $30 of methamphetamine in the first entry of P20[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81), which he understood to be Mr Fadli’s ‘usual order’. In his court testimony, Mr Fadli was rather vague about how much he paid for the drugs in his last two transactions. He had indicated that he had paid ‘_Thirty…less than 50, if I’m not mistaken’[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82)_ during his first transaction for some 0.2 to 0.3 grammes of _Ice_, and that the agreed price was ‘_around $50’[\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83)_ for the purchase on 2 August 2016. To be fair, Mr Fadli gave his evidence on 24 November 2017, almost 16 months from the day that he and Mr Shahidin had been arrested. Mr Shahidin’s account[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84), on the other hand, was that he had quoted a sum of $70-80 for 0.5 grammes of _Ice._ The amount actually seized from Mr Zulkifli was 0.50 grammes of crystalline substance that contained not less than 0.33 gram of methamphetamine. From the documented evidence, the difference might well be from a miscommunication during Mr Fadli’s initial call at 2.59 pm. This is because the price or quantity of the _Ice_ to be transacted is never mentioned again in the next 37 entries of the transcript. It may thus be inferred that both parties were oblivious to the metaphorical **_crossed lines_** between Mr Fadli’s actual order and Mr Shahidin’s impression of his order.

### Whether s 18(4) of the Misuse of Drugs Acts would apply here

76     Section 18 (4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act provides that where one of two or more persons with the **_knowledge_** and **_consent_** of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them. Section 18 (4) is a deeming provision imputing joint possession of the drug found in the possession of one of the individuals, where the stipulated conditions of knowledge and consent of his suspected confederates are met. Of the two conditions, it is quite patent from even his own account, that Mr Shahidin was aware that Mr Zulkifli was carrying the _Ice_ sachet concealed in layers of wrapper and boxes, when the pair were intercepted by CNB officers, and thus must be attributed to have had the requisite knowledge.

### Considering ‘Consent’

77     The other condition of **_consent_** requires a more considered delving into the principles elucidated by case law as well, and applied to the factual matrix of this case. In **_Ridzuan_**, the Court of Appeal had at \[64\] cited a formulation by then Judicial Commissioner Kan Ting Chiu in the case of **_Public Prosecutor v Lim Ah Poh_** , where Kan JC in using foreign authorities to assist in determining what constituted consent, had concluded (at \[71\]) that **_‘\[a\]cquiescence or condonation is not enough. There must be some dealing between the parties in relation to the drug, such as an agreement to buy it or help in concealing it’_****.**

78     The Court of Appeal in **_Ridzuan_** had also referenced the use of Kan JC’s formulation by the Court of Appeal in the case of in **_Hartej Sidhu v Public Prosecutor_** . **_Hatej_** has striking parallels to this case, as can be seen from the facts set out below.

79     The two accused persons, Mr Hartej and Mr Sarjit agreed to transact drugs with a certain Michael, who was actually an undercover CNB officer. After some discussions, which were predominantly conducted by Mr Sarjit, Michael placed an order for drugs to be supplied. Although Michael had arranged to deal with both accused persons. It was Mr Hartej who ultimately brought the bag of drugs to Michael by himself, and was arrested. Some ten minutes later, Mr Sarjit was also arrested while walking towards the coffee shop rendezvous. Mr Sarjit mounted a defence that the narcotics were not in his possession as they had not been found on him.

80     Delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Yong Pung How CJ held: at \[39\]

…Although the drugs were in the possession of the first appellant[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85), the second appellant[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86) clearly knew and consented to it in that there was an agreement between the appellants to deal with the drugs. **_By the same token, common intention to traffic in drugs was manifest from the circumstances. The appellants acted in concert pursuant to a prearranged plan to sell the drugs_**. \[_Emphasis added_\]

81     The circumstances in play for **_Hartej’s_** case to infer ‘consent’ would have included the major role undertaken by Mr Sarjit in his **_prior negotiations_** with Michael for the sale of the drugs. By the same token, the train of evidence here shows Mr Shahidin’s collective actions to extend far beyond mere ‘acquiescence or condonation’. Indeed, Mr Shahidin appeared to be the prime mover in **_essential middleman_** arrangements and negotiations starting from his receipt of Mr Fadli’s order, arranging for Mr Zulkifli to draw from his supply, directly quoting the selling price, co-ordinating with Mr Fadli in respect of the collection time and place, and completing the circle by actually accompanying the person in physical possession; Mr Zulkifli. The sheer extent of Mr Shahidin’s expended efforts to prosecute the sale of the sachet of methamphetamine are all too evident by the fact that his mobile phone had (according to P20) logged no fewer than 37 calls and messages with Mr Fadli’s phone, prior to interception and arrest by CNB officers.

82     Given this, I am of the view that the presumption of joint possession of the sachet of _Ice_ with Zulkifli provided by s 18(4) of the MDA. s 18(4) ought to apply to Mr Shahidin in this instance, as the element of consent has been patently fulfilled.

83     Defence counsel has raised a final point that the charge against Mr Shahidin was not made out as the packet of Ice had not yet been handed over to Mr Fadli or any officer from the Central Narcotics Bureau at the time of arrest. In this regard, I would agree with the prosecution’s response[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87) that Mr Shahidin’s charge is not of trafficking _simpliciter_ under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, but rather possession for the purpose of trafficking, _vide_ a joint enterprise with Mr Zulkifli to supply a quantity of methamphetamine to the client who had made an implicated purchase; Mr Fadli. Hence, the charge does not impose a requirement for the prosecution to prove that an act of trafficking has taken place, by the delivery of the packet, but rather **_‘(a)ll that needs to be shown is that the possession of the packet of Ice was for the purpose of trafficking i.e. that it was intended to be trafficked’_**.[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88)

84     In this case, with my finding that Mr Shahidin was the co-respondent for the calls and messages in D20, and my acceptance of Mr Fadli’s testimony as true, there is ample evidence of Mr Shahidin’s participation in the 2 August 2016 transaction with Mr Fadli. The evidence shows that Mr Shahidin did play a major role in the liaison work in the trafficking of the packet of _Ice_ to Mr Fadli, even if the packet of _Ice_ had come from an inventory maintained by Mr Zulkifli. As the learned DPP aptly pointed out, Mr Shahidin was inextricably involved in every step of Mr Fadli’s order – he took the order, communicated it to Mr Zulkifli, provided the materials to pack the packet of Ice and accompanied Mr Zulkifli to deliver it. The symbiotic relationship between Mr Shahidin’s suite of services to facilitate Mr Zulkifli’s drug supply is clear from the testimonial and circumstantial evidence. Their collaboration in this context is the virtual quintessence of common intention.

85     Mr Shahidin’s reticence in giving contact details of Mr Zulkifli to Mr Fadli to facilitate direct dealings between the two is also consistent with the behaviour of a middleman, who would be naturally keen to protect his own interest in maintaining the _status quo_ as the conduit of transactions between supplier and client.

86     Accordingly, I am of the view that the proceeded charge has been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and convict Mr Shahidin of this charge.

### Sentence imposed

87     Mr Shahidin has not appealed against the sentence imposed. I would nevertheless state, for the purpose of completeness, the reason for the sentence given. In sentencing, I noted that Mr Shahidin did have somewhat dated drug antecedents, having been sentenced served a term of 12 months’ detention at an SAF Detention Barrack on 15 Aug 2008. On 10 February 2010, he had been placed under a supervision order. Counsel had pleaded for leniency, and asked for the imposition of the minimum sentence in consideration of the small quantity involved. I noted that Counsel had a valid point in relation to the small value of the transaction for the methamphetamine supplied, and for which Mr Shahidin received a paltry reward of no more than a packet of cigarettes from Mr Zulkifli for his ‘middleman’ role in the transaction[\[note: 89\]](#Ftn_89).

88     In her sentencing recommendations, DPP Theong had leant on the side of moderation in indicating that she would have no objections to the minimum sentence despite the protracted proceedings.

89     I was in agreement with the prosecution’s position. While there would be no basis here for any notional **_discount_** granted for those who had entered timeous pleas of guilt, the law is clear that a person who has claimed trial should not be **_‘punished’_** with a heavier sentence upon conviction. This being particularly so where the mandatory minimum term would be a sufficiently severe deterrence on both general and specific aspects. I accordingly imposed the term of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane.
