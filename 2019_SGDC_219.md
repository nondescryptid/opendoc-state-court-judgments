\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9170/2019/01.\]

18 October 2019

### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Charges and Sentence

This is an appeal brought by the Accused, a 56 year-old Singaporean, against his conviction and sentence.

2       The Accused claimed trial to a single charge under Section 193 of the Penal Code. The charge reads:

> You, are charged that you, on or about 9 May 2015, at JusEquity Law Corporation, No. 137 Telok Ayer Street #05-01/02/03, Singapore, did intentionally give false evidence for the purpose of being used in a judicial proceeding, to wit, MC Suit No. 21415 of 2014, by affirming an Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”) which stated that “_XB6023A was repaired by Lian Hong Seng Motor Works in accordance with the recommendation by ST Appraisal Services”_ and that _“the said motor vehicle was repaired in accordance to the survey report”_ in reference to a Truck Mounted Attenuator (“TMA”), which statements you knew to be false, and which AEIC was subsequently filed in the State Courts of Singapore in connection with MC Suit No. 21415 of 2014, with the said statements being false because Lian Hong Seng Motor Works had purchased a replacement TMA rather than repaired it in accordance with the said survey report, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 193 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

3       At the end of the trial, I convicted the Accused and sentenced him to 6 months imprisonment.

## Undisputed Facts of the Case

4       The Accused was charged for giving false evidence under section 193 of the Penal Code. The false evidence comprised of two statements (as italicized in the charge above) contained in an affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) filed in MC Suit 21415/2014.

5       The undisputed facts were:

> 5.1     The accused is Tok Ching Sim, a 55-year-old Singaporean male and the owner of Lian Hong Seng Motor Works ("LHS").

> 5.2     On 25 November 2013, a truck with licence number XB6023A ("XB6023A") was stationary on the third lane of the Tampines Expressway in the direction of Changi. XB6023A was equipped with a truck-mounted attenuator ("TMA") which was mounted on the back of the vehicle. Both XB6023A and the TMA were owned by Ley Choon Constructions & Engineering Pte Ltd ("LCCE").

> 5.3     Subsequently, a vehicle with licence number SGQ5135P ("SGQ5135P") collided into the TMA from behind ("the accident"). The TMA was damaged as a result. The only damage arising from this accident was damage to the TMA.

> 5.4     LCCE sent XB6023A and the TMA to the Accused’s workshop LHS, for repair.

> 5.5     Pursuant to the accident, LCCE executed a Warrant to Act authorising JusEquity Law Corporation to act as LCCE's advocates and solicitors in respect of LCCE' s claim arising from the accident. The Warrant to Act also authorised JusEquity Law Corporation to take instructions from LHS.

> 5.6     On 27 November 2013, LHS engaged ST Appraisal Services to appraise XB6023A and the TMA.

> 5.7     The same day, T Thiyagarajan ("TT Rajan"), a motor vehicle appraiser of ST Appraisal Services, conducted an inspection of XB6023A and the TMA. He prepared a survey report for XB6023A dated 1 August 2014. TT Rajan's report noted that "_the repairer submitted a repair estimate of S$50,820.00_" and that "_we adjusted the costs claimed for the items listed. As such, the cost for the repair is S$47,000.00 which we consider to be appropriate_".

> 5.8     On 16 August 2014, LHS issued an invoice dated 16 August 2014 with an invoice amount of $47,000 to LCCE. The description stated in this invoice was "COST OF REPAIR AS PER ST APPRAISAL SERVICES SURVEYOR REPORT".

> 5.9     On 21 August 2014, JusEquity Law Corporation issued a letter of demand to the driver and insurers of SGQ5135P. The insurers for SGQ5135P were EQ Insurance Company,

> 5.10     On 17 November 2014, a Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim in MC Suit No. 21415 of 2014 was filed in the State Courts of Singapore, where LCCE was the plaintiff and one Tan Kim Liang (driver of SGQ5135P) was the defendant.

6       On 9 May 2015, the Accused affirmed the AEIC (Exhibit P1). This was filed in MC Suit 21415 of /2014 and served on the defendant. In the AEIC, the Accused stated, inter alia, that “_XB6023A was repaired by Lian Hong Motor Works in accordance with the recommendation by ST Appraisal Services_” and that “_the said motor vehicle was repaired in accordance to the survey report_” (“the statements” - which form the subject matter of the charge).

7       On 17 May 2017, the Accused affirmed a supplementary affidavit (Exhibit P4). In this supplementary affidavit, he stated that he had purchased a replacement TMA from Tomoda Auto Parts for $38,000 on 28 November 2013. An invoice from Tomoda Auto parts dated 28 November 2013 was exhibited in the supplementary affidavit. The Accused added (at paragraph 4) that he had “_inadvertently_” stated that the TMA was repaired when it was “_actually replaced_”. This supplementary affidavit was subsequently filed in MC 21415/2014 and served on the defendant in the suit.

8       From the outset, there was no dispute that the only damage to XB 6023A was to the TMA and any reference to XB6023A would invariably refer to the TMA.

## Prosecution’s Evidence

9       Apart from the undisputed facts above, PW4 TT Rajan, the independent motor surveyor from ST Appraisal Services testified after he conducted a physical inspection of the TMA on 27 November 2013, he conversed with “Selena” (who was the Accused’s wife), over the phone regarding the repairs. Selena provided him a repairer’s estimate of the cost of repairing the various parts of the TMA. The estimated costs were for the labour as well as the parts. It was “_one price for each_” and PW4 TT Rajan had informed Selena to “_replace individual items to a new one_”. He informed the court that after negotiation with Selena regarding the “_parts discount and then the labour”_, he adjusted the prices down. PW4 TT Rajan confirmed that the adjusted prices were “_part by part_”[^1]. There was no discussion about buying a replacement TMA as a whole item and he testified that it was never brought to his attention that LHS had bought the replacement TMA as a whole item[^2]. The survey report was only put up on 1 August 2014, about 8 months after the physical inspection.

10     PW1 Neo Kim In Charlie, Head of Claims in EQ Insurance Singapore (insurers for SGQ5135P) at the material time, testified that he filed a police report (Exhibit P5) on 19 September 2017, highlighting some concerns for police investigation[^3]:

> a)     The civil suit was to claim a sum of $47,000 for repairs of a TMA when there was no repair;

> b)     The civil suit also had a claim for 8 days for loss of use when the TMA was allegedly to be repaired, when again there was no repair;

> c)     The actual purchase of a new TMA was $38,000 but the claim remains $47,000.

11     In court, PW1 Charlie Neo testified that he found the claim for the cost of repair of $47,000 “_ridiculous_” since as a claims handler, he was aware that a new TMA would cost less than $40,000. The claim looked “_suspicious_” to him[^4]. Hence, PW1 Charlie Neo requested Toplis and Harding Singapore Private Limited (“Toplis”) to conduct a re-inspection of the TMA.

12     PW2 Victor Fong Whye Phoy, a professional loss adjuster in Toplis, put up two reports for EQ Insurance. The first report was dated 27 March 2015 (Exhibit P2) and was put up based only on coloured photographs of the damaged TMA and the repair estimates because he had been informed that the “_rectified TMA_” was not available for inspection[^5]. In court, consistent with his first report, PW2 Victor Fong confirmed that his assessment of the appropriate course of action for the damaged TMA was for it to be replaced since it would be cheaper to do so [^6].

13     Subsequently, upon further instructions from EQ Insurance (who could not agree to the quantum on the repair of cost with JusEquity[^7]), PW2 Victor Fong did a re-inspection of the TMA. On 8 September 2016, he managed to conduct a physical inspection of the TMA. It was only then that he was informed that the damaged TMA had been replaced with a new TMA. He further noted that the cartridges of the replacement TMA bore the serial number plates of the damaged TMA[^8]. To him, that was slightly puzzling because if a new TMA was bought, it would be better to use the new cartridge serial number (rather than reuse the old cartridge number) since that would affect how depreciation was determined[^9]. Upon re-inspection, a second report dated 11 October 2016 was put up by PW2 Victor Fong (Exhibit P3).

14     From the foregoing, a brief chronology of the key events in this case may be set out in the table as follows:

## Ingredients of the charge

15     There was no dispute that the statements contained in the AEIC constituted evidence were given and made for the purpose of being used in a judicial proceeding.

16     The key issues were whether:

> a)     the statements in the AEIC were false;

> b)     the Accused knew that the statements were false and had intentionally given such false evidence.

## Were the statements in the Accused’s AEIC false?

17     I find that the statements in the AEIC were false.

18     The statements in the AEIC were: “_XB6023A was repaired by Lian Hong Seng Motor Works in accordance with the recommendation by ST Appraisal Services_” and that “_the said motor vehicle was repaired in accordance to the survey report”._ The statements, similar in meaning, aver that XB6023A had been repaired in accordance with the recommendation by ST Appraisal Services in the survey report.

##### ST Appraisal Services survey report recommended a repair on a part-by-part basis

19     Page 3 of the survey report referred to a table for a detailed account of costs estimates, which appeared in this manner[^10]:

20     From the above table, we see an itemised list of parts, corresponding with the “_Repairer’s Estimate_” (the Accused’s estimated cost) and the “_Adjusted Prices_” (the surveyor’s adjusted cost), of each individual part. Based on the adjusted prices negotiated by PW4 TT Rajan, a total cost of $47,000 for the repair of the TMA was arrived at.

21     It was apparent on the face of ST Appraisal Services report that the repair of the TMA was recommended to be done on a part-by-part basis. That means that parts of the TMA were to be individually repaired or replaced[^11]. I accept that it was not expressly stated or prescribed in the survey report that the repair was to be carried out on a part-by-part basis. Notwithstanding, a perusal of the survey report would lead to the inexorable conclusion that the repair to the TMA was on a part-by-part basis. In court, PW4 TT Rajan himself confirmed that both the repairer’s estimate and his adjusted prices were on a part-by-part basis[^12]. It was also the Accused’s understanding that the surveyor had _“estimated the cost of restoring the vehicle to its pre-accident condition on a part-by-part basis for the replacement of individual parts and arrived at a recommended repair sum of $47,000_”[^13].

22     Based on an objective reading of the survey report which was consistent with the surveyor’s direct testimony in court and even the Accused’s own understanding, there was no confusion that any rectification to the TMA was recommended to be done on a per-part basis. The repairer’s own cost estimates were given on a per-part basis. There was nothing in the survey report which suggested that the TMA was to be replaced as a whole or any costs estimated or adjusted for such replacement. The fact that “_you still gets (sic) a complete TMA one way or the other_” - in the words of DW2 Heng Thong How Adrian[^14] - misses the point altogether because the manner in which a complete TMA was obtained at the end of the day, is crucial in this case.

23     As the facts show and Accused himself affirmed in a supplementary affidavit where he exhibited a purchase invoice dated 28 November 2013 therein: XB6023A (referring to the TMA) was not repaired on a part-by-part basis but completely replaced with the purchase of a new TMA costing $38,000. Hence, it must follow that the Accused’s statements in the affidavit which said that the “_XB6023A was repaired ….in accordance with the recommendation by ST Appraisal Services”_ and that the _“said motor vehicle was repaired in accordance with the survey report”_ must be false.

24     In the Accused’s own words when asked what he meant by the words in his AEIC, he stated in his police statement: “_I had meant in my AEIC that the TMA parts had been replaced by my workshop (Liam Hong Seng Motor Works) on a part-by-part basis as what was recommended by ST Appraisal Services_”[^15]. There was no confusion what the Accused meant when he made those statements. Even though the Accused used the term “_replace_” in explaining what he meant by his AEIC statements, it was clear that he was not referring to replacing the TMA as a complete whole.

##### “ _Repair_ ” and “ _Replace_ ”

25     There is no ambiguity surrounding the words “_repair_” and “_replace”_ in the context of this case. Whilst the dictionary meaning of the word “_repair_” may not be entirely inconsistent with the word “_replace_”, as the Defence had submitted, in the context of the facts of this case, a clear distinction between what has been repaired (on a part-by-part basis) and what has been replaced can and may be drawn. The Accused himself understood the difference since he subsequently filed a supplementary affidavit to clarify that he had “_inadvertently_” stated that the TMA was repaired, when it was actually replaced[^16]. The Accused, having been in the business of “_repair mudguard, paint and car repair_” for more than 32 years, clearly understood the difference between “_repair_” and “_replace_”[^17].

26     For the Defence to submit that “_the replacement of the whole necessarily involves a part-by-part replacement_”[^18] misleads one in the consideration of the issue, even if it is linguistically and technically not incorrect. The fixation on the terms may also be a red herring in this case. In any case, the fact remains that the Accused neither replaced nor repaired the TMA on a part-by part basis, but had chosen to purchase an entirely new TMA as replacement.

27     I re-emphasize that the nature of rectification to the damaged TMA is the crux in this case. If what the Accused had done in this case was to purchase the various parts of a TMA (as listed in the table in the surveyor’s report) and fixed them onto the original TMA in place of the damaged items for a total sum of $47,000, that may be in accordance with the recommendation of the survey report. However, the Accused did not do that. What the Accused did was to replace the damaged TMA, not on a part-by-part basis but by the purchase of an entirely new TMA at a much cheaper cost of $38,000. This was certainly not in accordance with the recommendation in the survey report. I find the statements in the AEIC undoubtedly false.

28     The statements in the AEIC were so patently false in view of the discovery by Toplis and the disclosure in the supplementary affidavit of the Accused that PW1 Charlie Neo lodged a police report thereafter.

## Did Accused know that the statements were false and had given them intentionally?

29     I find that the Accused knew that the statements were false.

30     The Accused’s police statements (a total of three statements admitted without challenge) made it clear that the Accused knew that the statements were false since it did not represent the true state of affairs. In the police statement recorded on 27 September 2017 (Exhibit P6), he stated:

> a)    “_I had stated that the said motor vehicle was repaired according to the survey report for a repair cost of $47,000 even though the price of the TMA that I had purchased was $38,000_.”[^19] ;

> b)    “_I know that it was wrong of me that I used the surveyor report that states the cost of repair is $45,000 to be submitted for claiming for insurance even though I did not follow the recommendations stated. I just wanted to maintain my business and felt if I were to state that the cost price of $38,000 and the cost of labour or any miscellaneous costs is $2,000, I might not earn money and might lose money_”[^20];

> c)     _“I would like to state that I did not know that it was illegal for me to submit documents or make declarations that are not really the truth. I told that these AEICs are for the sake of settlement. It was all for the sake of making a living_.”[^21]

31     The Accused knew that what he had stated was false but had done so for the sake of his business.

32     In the Accused’s further police statement recorded on 10 October 2017 (Exhibit P7), he maintained that by his AEIC statements, he had meant a replacement on a part-by-part basis[^22]. In his next answer, the Accused unequivocally confirmed that he was highly aware of the difference between what he had stated in his AEIC statements and what he actually did with the TMA:

> Q8 _Can I clarify with you if there is a difference when you mentioned that you had made replacements for the TMA based on a part-by-part basis as compared to purchasing a new TMA?_

> A8 _Yes. There is a difference as there is cost assigned to each individual part replaced for replacement performed for the TMA based on a part-by-part basis and if the new TMA is purchased, there is no cost assigned to each individual part for the TMA but there will be a total cost for purchase[^23]._

33     In his cautioned statement (Exhibit P9) the Accused stated: “_I bought the TMA from Malaysia instead of following the surveyor report……._” The Accused not only clearly knew the difference between what he had stated in the AEIC and what he actually did with the TMA, he knew the statements were false.

34     The Accused saw the need to file a supplementary affidavit, claiming “_inadvertence_” and seeking to explain what he actually did was to replace the TMA, not repair it. The motivations of DW2 Adrian Heng in drafting the supplementary affidavit do not exculpate the Accused. It is well-accepted that a lawyer acts on his client’s instructions. How a lawyer drafts an affidavit is dependent on what information his client (in this case, the Accused), chooses to furnish him. The Accused himself agreed with that[^24]. He affirmed the contents to be true and correct after the affidavit had been interpreted to him in a language he was competent in (on both occasions) and signed off at the end. The affidavit, though drafted by DW2 Adrian Heng, is the Accused’s affidavit.

35     I also find that the Accused did intentionally give such false statements. This was apparent from the admissions he made in his police statements.

36     The AEIC was drafted based on the Accused’s instructions. In his police statement Exhibit P6, the Accused stated that on 9 May 2015 when he went down to the lawyer’s office, he informed the Commissioner of Oaths Mr Chwee Han Sin that he had repaired the vehicle in accordance to the survey report. He admitted that he did not show his lawyers the invoice from Tomoda Auto Parts that was issued to him even though he had the receipt in his possession since early December 2013. The Accused felt that it was not necessary for his lawyer or the insurance company to know the process on how he had repaired or replaced the parts of the vehicle[^25]. The Accused intentionally chose not to reveal the fact that he had bought a new TMA to replace the damaged TMA at the time when he made the first AEIC.

37     The Accused had personal knowledge of what had been done with and/or to the damaged TMA. This was clearly not a case whereby the Accused was not directly involved in the work relating to the damaged TMA and had relied on information conveyed to him by, for example, Selena or his workers, such that he had casually made the statements in the AEIC without verification. It was not a case whereby he was seeking to clarify the situation subsequently in the supplementary affidavit because he had obtained more information about what was done to the TMA. The Accused himself was responsible for purchasing the replacement TMA from one “_Ah Hua_”[^26]. By selectively choosing the materials and information he wanted to reveal to his lawyers, which included concealing facts known to him personally, the Accused caused the AEIC to be drafted in the way as we see it in Exhibit P1. He went on to affirm the accuracy of the contents of the AEIC. The Accused intentionally made those false statements.

38     Other admissions in his police statement Exhibit P6 reveal the Accused’s state of mind:-

> a)     Answer to Q5:

>> “_I had stated that the said motor vehicle was repaired according to the survey report for a repair cost of $47,000 even though the price of the TMA that I had purchased was $38,000. This is because I feel that if I did not state/affirm (interviewee states in Malay word “sompah”) on AEIC that the repair cost is $47,000.00 (in which the cost of purchase is $45,000.00/-) – After the insurance companies requested for a deduction percentage I will get lesser profits if I were to state that true cost of purchase is $38,000.00/- and labour cost is $2,000.00/-. Insurance will not pay accordingly_”;

> b)     Answer to Q7:

>> _“I had used the surveyor report as the cost price of replacement the individual parts was inflated by $7,000.00/- to about $45,000.00/- after deduction for the labour costs, $2,000.00/-. I feel that if I were to honestly state that the cost price of replacement is actually $38,000.00/- and if I were state labour costs (Money that I will earn) is $2,000.00/-, I will end up claiming for lesser insurance monies from the insurance companies and might stand to lose money.”;_

> c)     Answer to Q8:

>> “_I feel that it was not necessary for the law firm or insurance company to know the actual cost price of the purchase and hence decided to omit it and instead submitted the surveyor report which showed an inflated cost price_”;

> d)     Answer to Q13:

>> _“No. The business and the idea of inflating the cost price of purchase for the TMA by using the surveyor report was my idea so that I can earn/claim for more insurance monies”._

39     The Accused was aware that the statements were false and had made the false statements because he was motivated by fear. He was afraid that if he were to claim the exact cost of the replacement TMA at $38,000, he may end up, not only not being able to earn any money from this job assignment, he might even lose money if he takes into account his labour charges.

40     In answer to Q16 in P6, he stated:

> _“I know that it was wrong of me that I used the surveyor report that states that the cost of purchase is $45,000.00/- to be submitted for claiming for insurance even though I did not follow the recommendations stated. I just wanted to maintain my business and felt if I were to state that the cost price of $38,000 and the cost of labour or any miscellaneous costs is $2,000.00/-, I might not earn money and might lose money_”.

41     The guilty mind of the Accused is further manifested in his subsequent police statement recorded on 10 October 2017 (Exhibit P7) when he was asked why the replacement TMA cartridge bore the serial numbers of the damaged TMA. The Accused explained:

> a)     Answer to Q2:

>> _I just want the owner (Ley Choon) to see that the replaced TMA is the same as old TMA and that everything will appear to be the same as what it was before the accident. The reason why I replaced the serial numbers is show to others that the TMA is the same as the old one and there is no reason for them to know that the TMA had been purchased it from Malaysia_”;

> b)     Answer to Q3:

>> _“Like I mentioned, there is no need for them to know that the TMA is bought from M’sia. I do not need to let them know on where I had purchased the TMA and what is the actual cost of purchasing the TMA, I just need to give them a working TMA after replacement, I do not want them to know how much I had spent for the actual costs of replacement_”.

42     In court, the Accused offered a different reason as to why he re-used the serial numbers on the cartridges of the damaged TMA on the new TMA[^27]. As with the Prosecution, I find that the Accused’s explanation for re-using the old serial numbers were an afterthought. None of it was stated in the police statements when the Accused was asked and he had chosen to elaborate in detail, as set out above. From his conduct in re-using the old serial numbers and his admissions in the police statement, one could conclude that the Accused wanted to convey the impression that the damaged TMA had been repaired on a part-by-part basis in accordance with the survey report, when in truth, he had bought an entirely new TMA as replacement for the damaged one. The replacement TMA would have borne different serial numbers on its cartridges, thus giving away the fact that they were new.

43     In a handwritten portion of P7 at the end of the statement, the candid admission by the Accused perhaps aptly sums up his motivations behind making the false statements. He states: _“For survival and for business, I decided to inflate the claims as I am scared that the insurance companies will cut down the claim amount. Please be lenient on me. The insurance companies will negotiate and cut down my costs and claims”._

44     These admissions in his police statements demonstrate that it was not “_inadvertence_” which caused the Accused to make the statements in his AEIC. At the point of making the AEIC, he had deliberately chosen not to disclose the purchase invoice of the replacement TMA which he had in his possession to his lawyers. When it was subsequently uncovered by Toplis that a replacement TMA had been purchased instead of the TMA having been repaired on a part-by-part basis, the Accused filed the supplementary affidavit to salvage the situation, this time making frank disclosure by annexing the purchase invoice dated 28 November 2013 to the supplementary affidavit. The chronology of events set out in paragraph 14 speak for itself.

45     I find that the Accused did know that the statements he had made in the AEIC were false and he had intentionally stated them in order to inflate the claims against third-party insurers. The Accused’s protest that what he did for his claim was “_business practice_”[^28] and “_it was all for the sake of making a living_”[^29] did not absolve him from liability in intentionally making false statements in his AEIC.

##### Accused’s police statements

46     The contents of the Accused’s three police statements may be relied on for the truth.

47     The police statements were voluntarily given. The Investigating Officer, also the recording officer for the statements, PW5 Insp Lie Dai Cheng described the recording process and testified that at no time did the Accused express any difficulties or confusion with the recording process. PW5 Insp Lie informed the Court that his mother tongue was Chinese and being able to appreciate the different Chinese terms for “_repair_” and “_replace_”[^30], he expressed it in the statement accordingly. The Accused sought to explain that he was confused when his statements were recorded[^31]; however, these assertions were neither substantiated nor put to PW5 Insp Lie when he was on the stand.

48     PW5 Insp Lie confirmed that he read over the statements to the Accused in Mandarin after he had recorded each one of them. The Accused was offered the opportunity to make any corrections or additions at the conclusion of each recording and as can be seen in the statements, he did take up PW5’s offer to do so when necessary[^32]. When offered the opportunity to add or amend any facts previously given in earlier police statements recorded, prior to the commencement of the recording of a subsequent police statement, the Accused maintained each time he did not wish to change anything[^33].

49     Despite Accused’s attempt to minimise the incriminating nature of his statements[^34], I did not have any difficulty placing weight on the Accused’s three police statements to find that the Accused did know the statements in the AEIC were false and had intentionally made them.

## Charges proved beyond a reasonable doubt

50     Having considered the totality of the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the Accused guilty and convicted him accordingly.

## The Appropriate Sentence

51     The punishment prescribed for an offence under section 193 of the Penal Code for intentionally giving false evidence in any stage of judicial proceeding is a maximum imprisonment term of 7 years; the offender is also liable to a fine.

52     The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents which showed imprisonment terms ranging from 1 month to 2 years imposed for offences under section 193 of the Penal Code. The Prosecution confirmed that there was a dearth of recently reported judgments for offences under this section[^35] with the last such reported case in 2006.

53     In the case of _Koh Pee Huat v PP_ \[1996\] 2 SLR(R) at paragraph 74, Yong Pung How CJ, as he then was, recognised that the “_normal tariff_” was 6 months’ imprisonment. Subsequent cases of _Tan Mui Teck v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 162</span> and _Ong Geok Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 120</span> confirmed the normal tariff for an offence under section 193 of the Penal Code to be 6 months imprisonment. That said, I was mindful a tariff _“is not cast in stone….. It provides the focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases, with different degrees of criminal culpability, can be accurately determined_”[^36].

54     In _Koh Pee Huat_, CJ Yung imposed a nominal punishment of 1 month on appeal. However, he was careful to emphasize at \[75\], that _“an offence under section 193 of the Penal Code for fabricating false evidence used in any stage of judicial proceeding is a very serious one, carrying mandatory imprisonment term that can extend to seven years. It is obvious that the consequences of perjury can be very severe and it was, as I have stated earlier, only because of the exceptional circumstances in this case that a nominal sentence was passed”._ In the case of _Koh Pee Huat_, what was exceptional about the circumstances was that the although the statement in the affidavit was false, it was tendered for the purpose of proving a fact which was actually true and could not have led to any unjust consequences[^37].

55     I did not find anything exceptional in the circumstances of the case before me. The Accused had made false statements in an AEIC in an attempt to inflate his claim against insurers so that he could ensure he made a profit from the job assignment in respect of the TMA. This was particularly serious as inflated claims have the potential to increase premiums paid by vehicle owners/drivers[^38]. In Singapore where it is mandatory for every vehicle to be covered by insurance, such conduct, even if accepted as a “_business practice_”[^39] in the motor vehicle industry because _“the insurance companies will negotiate and cut \[his\] costs and claims_”[^40], cannot be condoned. What Accused did, by making false statements in his AEIC to inflate his claim against insurers, was wrong and he was wholly culpable. Deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration.

56     Notwithstanding the gravity of what the Accused had done and the fact that he had claimed trial (for which a discount in sentencing would not be available to him), I took into account the fact that he was a first offender. I also noted that the Accused eventually filed a supplementary affidavit, owning up to the truth of what he had done with the TMA; there was no evidence of loss occasioned to the insurers or gain to the Accused, by his giving of the false statements.

57     In _Tan Mui Teck v PP_, _Leonard Lawrence Maria Soosay v PP_ MA 185/2001, _Hou Ah Hui v PP_ MA 355/2000[^41], the tariff sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment was imposed in each of these cases. In _Tan Mui Teck_, the false evidence related to the offender stating in his AEIC that the employees were not entitled to CPF contributions because they were consultants. In addition, he attached false documents to support his assertion. In _Leonard Lawrence_, the offender fabricated false evidence in the form of a letter confirming that one Alwi had made full restitution to his employer, as mitigation for the said Alwi. In _Hou Ah Hui_, the offender was convicted after trial for instigating a private investigator to insert a false account of having observed her husband’s extra-marital affair. The Accused’s act of giving false statements in his AEIC to support an inflated claim is broadly similar to these precedent cases in which the tariff sentence of 6 months was imposed.

58     Bearing in mind the totality of circumstances in this present case, including the mitigating factors, I was of the view that 6 months’ imprisonment was an appropriate sentence for the Accused in this case.
