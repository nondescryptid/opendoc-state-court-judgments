### Deputy Registrar Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       This action arose from a motor accident which resulted in property damage to the Plaintiff’s lorry. Interlocutory Judgment was entered in default of appearance. Parties appeared before me to assess damages.

2       The Plaintiff seeks to recover the repair bill in the sum of $55,105. The Defendant argued that the lorry, by the time of the accident, was worth only about $8,000, making the repair patently uneconomical. The central question to be addressed is whether the Plaintiff should have, in view of the prevailing market value of the lorry, scrapped the damaged lorry and acquired a replacement lorry instead. I begin my analysis by examining the market value of the lorry.

## Market value and replacement cost

3       In support of the Defendant’s case, the Defendant relies on the expert evidence of Mr Melvin Lum, an automotive appraiser and loss adjustor in the employ of KOAYS Accident Reconstruction Pte Ltd. Mr Lum assessed the market value of the lorry at the time of the accident to be $8,246. When the accident occurred on 5 March 2014, the lorry, registered in 1996, was already close to 18 years old, and had only about two years left in its Certificate of Entitlement (“COE”). It is common ground that the lorry would have to be scrapped upon the expiration of its COE. Mr Lum observed that the lorry was in poor condition, evident from corrosion on its body panels and visible tears on its upholstery. It was in his view near the tail-end of its operational lifespan. To value the lorry, Mr Lum adopted what is called a “linear depreciation method”. Based on this approach, the value of the lorry is derived by multiplying the annual depreciation value by the number of years left in use. To calculate its annual depreciation value, Mr Lum referred to comparative models listed for sale on the open market, the closest being a lorry registered in January 2010, with its (renewed) COE valid till August 2029. Based on its listed price, that lorry had an annual depreciation of $4,260. Taking into consideration the subject lorry being much older as well as its poor physical condition, Mr Lum opined that its market value should be $8,246. The Plaintiff’s attempts to discredit Mr Lum’s assessment during cross-examination were largely unsuccessful. The Plaintiff also did not lead any evidence to contradict Mr Lum’s assessment. In my view, even buffering for some discount that may be applied to the listed price of the comparative lorry, there is no evidence to suggest that the estimated market value of $8,246 was unreasonable.

4       The Plaintiff argued that the sale listings relied on by Mr Lum, dated between late 2019 to early 2020, were not contemporaneous and thus unreliable. While I agree that the market value of the damaged lorry should be assessed at the time of the accident, the Plaintiff’s contention ignores the fact the sale listings tendered by the Defendant were the only relevant evidence before the court. In the absence of countervailing evidence, the assessment should be made based on the sale listings, along with Mr Lum’s testimony. Mr Lum further explained during cross-examination that while the prices may vary overtime, such variations are unlikely to be significant for the particular make and model of the subject lorry. Against this, there was no evidence to suggest that the market prices for the make and model of the lorry had plummeted between 2014 and 2020.

5       As opposed to its market value, the Plaintiff tried to value the lorry based on the loss of rental revenue. In this regard, he argued that the lorry could have been rented out for $150 a day, which would have fetched aggregate rental revenues as much as $113,550 for the rest of its lifespan (757 days multiplied by $150 per day), and even hypothesising a 70% rent-out rate at a discounted rental rate of $135 per day, the Plaintiff argued that the lorry could still have earned $71,536.50. With respect, this valuation is evidentially and conceptually flawed. First of all, the Plaintiff’s evidence is that he was in the business of transporting goods, not providing lorry rentals, and he further revealed during cross-examination that he had in fact transferred the subject lorry to his brother in April 2014, a month after the accident. The Plaintiff’s valuation rests on a hypothetical that is at odds with reality. The loss of revenue claim is therefore a non-starter. In any event, no evidence was led to prove that the Plaintiff would have garnered enough demand to rent out the lorry for 70% of the time in the span of two years. No evidence was also led on the expenses required to operate a lorry rental business which would include the costs of obtaining the necessary permits, insurance coverage, parking fees, marketing expenses, manpower and administrative costs, amongst others. This would no doubt reduce the net profit available, assuming there is even any left.

6       I therefore agree with Mr Lum that the subject lorry should be valued at $8,246. On a balance of probabilities, this is how much it would have cost to purchase a replacement lorry of the similar make, model and age from the open market at the time of the accident. In the present case, it is undisputed that the Plaintiff would also be entitled to a COE rebate of $2,066 upon scrapping the damaged lorry at the time of the accident. This amount should be deducted from the market value to avoid overcompensating the Plaintiff. After deducting the COE rebate, the replacement cost comes up to $6,181, which is the amount that the Plaintiff would have to fork out to acquire a replacement lorry from the open market.

## Damages should assessed based on the replacement cost

7       The Defendant’s case is that the more economical course of action would have been to replace rather than repair the lorry. I agree that the Plaintiff had no good reason to repair the lorry for $55,105 when he could have replaced it for $6,181. What transpired was that he agreed to give the repairer full discretion to carry out the repairs and full authority to commence legal proceedings in the Plaintiff’s name to recover the repair costs, on the understanding that the Plaintiff would not be made out-of-pocket for the same. This probably explains why he did not consider the cheaper alternative.

8       A chattel is generally only economical to repair up to its market value. One of the leading authorities that illustrates this legal principle is the case of _Darbishire v Warran_ \[1963\] 1 WLR 1068 (“_Darbishire v Warran_”) which involved similar facts. In that case, the plaintiff bought a used motor car for £330. The car was seriously damaged in a collision caused by the defendant. The plaintiff sued for the repair costs of £180. The defendant pointed out that a replacement vehicle would have cost only £85, and sought to limit the damages that amount. The English Court of Appeal refused to award the repair costs in full. Harman LJ explained the applicable legal principles as follows (at 1071 and 1072):

> The principle is that of restitutio in integrum, that is to say, to put the plaintiff in the same position as though the damage had not happened. It has come to be settled that in general the measure of damage is the cost of repairing the damaged article; but there is an exception if it can be proved that the cost of repairs greatly exceeds the value in the market of the damaged article. This arise out of the plaintiff’s duty to minimise his damages. Were it otherwise it would be more profitable to destroy the plaintiff’s article than to damage it. …

> … The true question was whether the plaintiff acted reasonably as between himself and the defendant and in view of his duty to mitigate the damages. …

9       Applying these principles, Harman LJ went on to find that the vehicle in question was not irreplaceable and since the cost of repairs greatly exceeded its value, it should be treated as a constructive total loss with the measure of damages being its value (at 1073).

10     In a concurring judgment, Pearson LJ explained that the duty to mitigate damages does not mean that the plaintiff is bound to adopt the “cheaper method” of restoring his original position. The plaintiff is fully entitled to be “as extravagant as he pleases but not at the expense of the defendant” (at 1075).

11     I pause to discuss some criticisms subsequently levelled against _Darbishire v Warran_ in _Coles and others v Hetherton and others_ \[2013\] 1 All ER (Comm) 453. In that case, the claimant’s insurers managed to repair the negligently damaged vehicles at a cost lower than what the policyholders would have had to pay in the open market. The defendants argued that the actual costs of repair incurred should form the measure of damages and that the claimant’s insurers ought to have mitigated their damages. Cooke J disagreed with this argument and found in favour of the claimant’s insurers. In arriving at this conclusion, Cooke J disagreed with the holding in _Darbishire v Warran_’s that the measure of damages is the cost of repair. In his view, the _direct_ loss suffered is actually the diminution in the market value of the car, and the reasonable cost of repair is merely _evidence_ of that diminution (at \[32\] and \[38\]). He elaborated as follows:

> \[38\]  There is nothing unusual in a court assessing the diminution in value of an asset by whatever evidence is available although, as a matter of ordinary course, in a small claim, the production of a repair invoice is frequently the best way of doing that since the cost of repair is the prima facie measure of that loss. Where only part of an item is repaired or where the work does not restore the asset to its pre-accident value or the claimant does not repair at all or merely effects temporary repairs, the diminution in value must be assessed by reference to other materials. Nor can it be said that there is a rule of law that where repairs are effected, the cost of repair has to be taken subject to mitigation arguments. None of the authorities suggest such a rule and indeed such a rule would run counter to the principles that have been set out from the time of the decision in _The Endeavour_ through until _Burdis v Livsey_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] QB 36</span>. The recovery for damage done to a chattel is not dependent upon repairs being done or costs of repair being paid by the claimant since the compensation is for loss in value, not the cost of the repair as such.

> \[39\]  The decision in _Jones v Stroud DC_ \[1988\] 1 All ER 5, <span class="citation">\[1986\] 1 WLR 1141</span> demonstrates the fallacy in the defendants’ position. There was no evidence before the court that the claimant was liable to the company, in which he had an interest, to pay for the costs of repairs done to rectify the damage to his house. He failed to disclose any documents that showed any payment by him or any liability to make such payment. The court had therefore to proceed on the basis that he had incurred no expense at all. Although no argument seems to have been raised about mitigation as such, the Court of Appeal held that the claimant was entitled to recover on the basis of expert evidence relating to an estimate for the cost of repair that had been obtained from a third party contractor who had been asked to quote but did not do the work. Repairs had been done, but the actual cost to the claimant had to be taken as nil. He nonetheless made a substantial recovery on the basis of the court’s assessment as to the reasonable costs of repairs. Mitigation did not feature in the argument because, in the context, that was rightly considered an irrelevant consideration where the damage had already been suffered in the shape of the diminution in value of the house.

> \[40\]  The decision in _Darbishire v Warran_ \[1963\] 3 All ER 310, <span class="citation">\[1963\] 1 WLR 1067</span>, in relation to mitigation, must be seen as an aberration. The same result would have been arrived at more readily by an application of the test of diminution in value. If the cost of repair exceeds the value of the damaged chattel, it is self-evident that the value of the asset in its damaged condition is nil or scrap value. The diminution in value is assessed by reference to its market value at the time of the damage which represents the total loss of the claimant.

> \[41\]   _Burdis v Livsey_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] QB 36</span> also exemplifies the point. The judgment of the court, given by Aldous LJ held that, in accordance with _Jones v Stroud DC_, the claimant could recover though she had paid nothing for the cost of repairs and was not liable to pay such cost because the credit repair agreement, under which the finance company paid the cost of repair, was unenforceable against her. That agreement was held to be collateral to the tort and had to be left out of account in assessing her loss. It could not be said that the agreement flowed from any act of mitigation on her part because there was no relevant causal connection. The reason she entered into that agreement was the failure of the defendant’s insurers to settle the claim and the fact that payment for the repairs was made by someone else was irrelevant in the context of assessing damages (‘repair costs are merely the measure of a direct loss, suffered when the tort was committed, and are not to be regarded as falling within the category of potential future losses claimable as special damage’: see \[95\]).

12     Of course, Cooke J, sitting in the English High Court, could not expressly overrule the law laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Darbishire v Warran_. He decided to disregard that decision in his analysis on the basis that it stood as an “aberration” from the well-established legal principles. The matter was eventually put to rest when his decision went on appeal, where the English Court of Appeal affirmed his decision and endorsed his critique in _Coles and others v Hetherton and others_ \[2014\] 3 All ER 377 (“_Coles_”). The English Court of Appeal in _Coles_ also agreed with Cooke J that the court was wrong to have applied the principle of mitigation in its analysis. The traditional approach of assessing a damaged chattel by reference to the diminution in its value would have been sufficient to dispose of the matter and would have led the court to the same conclusion. Aikens LJ, who delivered the judgment of the court, issued the following remarks:

> \[31\]  Both Harman and Pearson LJJ \[in _Darbishire v Warran_\] made some remarks suggesting that the claimant was under a duty to mitigate his loss and that he failed to do so in this case and that was the reason why he could not recover the full cost of the repairs. Pennycuik J made similar comments. In our view these statements suggesting that the principle of mitigation of loss was relevant to the question of what damages could be recovered for the physical damage to the car were, with respect, misplaced. They lose sight of the fact that the cost of repairs is only evidence of the amount of the loss recoverable, viz the amount of the diminution in value of the chattel. As Cooke J pointed out at \[35\] of his judgment, the court in _Darbishire v Warran_ was apparently not referred to the long line of Admiralty cases which established the law, such as _The Endeavour_ (1890) 6 Asp MLC 511, _The Glenfinlas_ \[1918\] P 363n, \[1918–19\] All ER Rep 365n, _The Kingsway_ \[1918\] P 344, \[1918–19\] All ER Rep 360 and _The London Corp_ \[1935\] P 70, \[1935\] All ER Rep 393. The principles established in those cases have since been authoritatively reaffirmed by Lord Hobhouse in the House of Lords in _Dimond v Lovell_ \[2000\] 2 All ER 897, <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 AC 384</span> and by this court in both _Jones v Stroud DC_ \[1988\] 1 All ER 5, \[1986\] 1 WLR 114132 and _Burdis v Livsey_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] QB 36</span>, \[2002\] 3 WLR 76233. Thus we agree with the statement of Cooke J that the remarks on mitigation in _Darbishire v Warran_ must be seen as an ‘aberration’. But the actual decision in that case, based on Harman LJ’s analysis, was correct.

> \[32\]  In summary, if a claimant, whose damaged chattel is capable of economic repair, chooses to repair it at a cost which is not reasonable, then the reason why he cannot recover that unreasonable cost as damages will be because that cost does not represent the diminution in value of the chattel. What is the diminution in value of a chattel or the ‘reasonable cost of repair’ will always be a question of fact for the trial judge to determine if it is in dispute.

13     According to the appeal tracker on LexisNexis, the Supreme Court later on refused permission to appeal against the decision. As things stand, _Coles_ is the final word on this issue insofar as English law is concerned.

14     In Singapore, no reported decision has considered the qualification made by _Coles_ to _Darbishire v Warran_. Thus far, the lone authority that has expressly endorsed and applied the principle in _Darbishire v Warran is Masterfox Connections Pte Ltd v N & I Transportation and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGMC 5</span> (“_Masterfox_”), a case that was decided before _Coles_. _Masterfox_ also involved a claimant who sued to recover a repair bill in excess of the market value of the damaged chattel. A sum of $24,000 was spent on repairing a vehicle that was worth only $11,000 with a net market value of $3,700 after accounting for the salvage/scrap value of $7,300. Applying the principle in _Darbishire v Warran_, the court found that the claimant had unreasonably proceeded with the repair. Interestingly, in addition to the net market value of $3,700, the court went a step further and awarded the outstanding balance of a loan taken on the vehicle in the sum of $10,560, on the basis that it was an “expense incurred in order to mitigate the loss” because the claimant was unable to scrap the vehicle without paying off such balance. In the present case there is no evidence of any outstanding loan on the subject lorry for me to consider. I would however observe in parenthesis that the additional award made in _Masterfox_ puts the claimant in a better position than he was before the accident. In effect, the court had relieved the claimant of the burden of paying the outstanding loan – which he would have had to bear without the accident. But since this issue does not concern us in the present case, it is not necessary for me to dwell on this any further. For present purposes, _Masterfox_ stands for the proposition that a claimant cannot wilfully rack up a repair bill without regard for the cost of acquiring a replacement chattel.

15     Another local authority relied upon by the Defendant is the High Court decision of _Yip Holdings Pte Ltd v Asia Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 131</span> (“_Yip Holdings_”), which was again decided before _Coles_. _Yip Holdings_ concerned the assessment of damages of a crane that was considered beyond economic repair, in that the cost of repair far exceeded the market value of the crane. The crane was found to be in deplorable condition and near scrap value (at \[31\]). Though _Darbishire v Warran_ and _Masterfox_ were not discussed in the judgment, the High Court arrived at the same conclusion as the court in _Coles_ did that the measure of damages for a chattel is the diminution in its value; for a chattel in constructive total loss, the _prima facie_ measure would be its market value plus other consequential losses. No reference was made to the principle of mitigation. It is apposite to reproduce the relevant principles pronounced by the court:

> 12    … As Andrew Burrows in _Remedies for Torts and Breach of Contract_ (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2004) observed (at 232):

>> Whether for torts or breach of contract, the general compensatory aims dictate that the claimant should be put into as good a position as if its property had not been damaged.

> 13    In the context of the present case, how this general compensatory principle is to be applied will depend on whether the chattel was damaged or destroyed. In the case of damage to property, the amount by which the value of the chattel is diminished is usually equated with the cost of repair. Alternatively, if the damaged chattel is owned for use, the measure of damages would be the cost of replacement of a similar chattel and loss of use. However, where the chattel has been destroyed or is a constructive total loss in the sense that it would be uneconomic to repair, the _prima facie_ measure of damages is the value of the chattel at the time and place of destruction, plus any other consequential losses (see _Owners of Dredger Liesbosch v Owners of Steamship Edison_ <span class="citation">\[1933\] AC 449</span> at 464 _per_ Lord Wright and _Butterworth’s Common Law Series, The Law of Damages_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2010) (“_Butterworth’s Law of Damages_”) ch 14 paras 14.01 and 14.02).

16     In my judgment, I am inclined to take the view that _Darbishire v Warran_ was correctly decided save for the qualification made in _Coles_, which is that the direct loss for damaged chattels should be the diminution in its value, and as such the court should not have relied on the principles of mitigation in its analysis. As far as the present facts are concerned, the relevant legal principles may be briefly expressed as follows. The normal measure of damages for chattels is the value by which the damaged chattel has diminished. _Prima facie_, the cost of repair required to restore the damaged chattel to its original condition as if the damage had not been done may evidence the diminution in value, assuming the chattel could be economically repaired. If the chattel is not capable of economic repair, the chattel would be treated as a constructive total loss and accordingly the diminution in value would generally be assessed by reference to its market value at the time of damage, assuming the chattel could be replaced in the open market. This approach broadly aligns with the principles pronounced by the High Court in _Yip Holdings_.

17     The Plaintiff did not take issue with the legal principle that a claimant is generally entitled to recover damages for a chattel only up to its market value at the time of the damage. He cited the case of _Aerospace Publishing Ltd v Thames Water Utilities Ltd_ \[2007\] Bus LR 726 which deals with chattels that cannot be readily replaced, but that decision clearly does not concern us since it is undisputed that the subject lorry was readily replaceable in the open market. To exonerate himself of the exorbitant repair bill, he sought to distinguish _Darbishire v Warran_ on the ground that the plaintiff in that case proceeded with the repair against the advice of his insurers and repairers, whereas the Plaintiff himself received no such advice from his surveyor and repairer. I am unable to agree. It seems to me that the predicament complained of was entirely self-inflicted. The Plaintiff received no contrary advice precisely because he was content with giving the repairer free reign to conduct the repairs and to recover whatever repair costs it deems fit from the Defendant. In my view, a reasonable man in the Plaintiff’s shoes would not have given the repairer unfettered discretion to conduct and charge for the repairs. He would have enquired the repair cost and compared that against the cost of a replacement lorry. Upon realising that the repair would cost far more than it would to acquire a replacement lorry, a reasonable man would have realised that it was not economical to repair the lorry. A reasonable man would not have unreasonably enlarged the restoration cost at the expense of the defendant. He would have instead acquired a replacement lorry from the open market. It is clear from the evidence that the Plaintiff did none of these things.

18     A separate but related argument raised by the Plaintiff is that, unlike the claimant in _Darbishire v Warran_, the Plaintiff had no knowledge that the lorry was a constructive total loss at the time of repair. He further argued that the claimant must possess _actual knowledge_ of constructive total loss at the time of repair before he can be expected to replace the damaged vehicle. The first proposition is factually misconceived. Any perceived lack of knowledge was a result of the Plaintiff’s own doing. He could have asked for a cost estimate for the repairs but conveniently decided not to do so. He also, by his own admission, knew that the lorry had to be scrapped in about two years and was depreciating annually somewhere between $3,000 to $8,000, which meant that he knew its residual value was somewhere between $6,000 to $16,000. A reasonable man in these circumstances would have checked how much the repair would cost. Had he done so, it would have been apparent that the lorry was a constructive total loss. The second proposition – made without authority – is not endorsed by any of the cases discussed above. While the claimant in _Darbishire v Warran_ was apprised of the market value and the repair costs, such subjective knowledge did not feature as relevant consideration in the court’s analysis. The analysis focussed squarely on the market value of the vehicle, assessed _objectively_ at the time of the accident.

19     The objective measure of assessing the claimant’s conduct is also evident from legal principles enunciated in _Masterfox_ as follows:

> 15.    It is trite law that, the normal measure of damages is the amount by which the value of the goods damaged has been diminished. In the case of goods or property, the cost of repairs has been established as prima facie, the correct measure of the claimant’s loss – see McGregor Damages 17 edition (2003) at paragraph 32-003. This is no more than the expression of the principle that the loss to be measured is based on restoring the Plaintiff to as near as possible to his original position before the Defendants’ negligence had cause the damage to the property, the vehicle in this case.

> 16.    As mentioned, in such cases, the normal measure of loss is of course the general principle. To this general principle the law has however added a qualification. That qualification relates to this. As it has been noted the cost of repair is appropriate as a measure of loss only if in the circumstances, it is reasonable for the claimant to repair. It would be different if it was cheaper to buy a replacement on the market and sell the damaged property for what it will fetch – see McGregor, supra at paragraph 32-004.

20     In the course of its analysis, the court in _Masterfox_ similarly did not consider the claimant’s subjective knowledge of the replacement cost to be relevant.

21     Above all, the subjective test advocated by the Plaintiff provides claimants with a convenient excuse to unreasonably rack up the repair bill without regard for the amount that truly represents the diminution in value of the chattel. Rather than proactively finding out the economic repair value, claimants are far better off feigning ignorance. The end result of that proposition runs contrary to the underlying policy of the decisions in _Darbishire v Warran, Masterfox, Coles_ and _Yip Holdings_, which is to dissuade claimants from repairing chattels found in constructive total loss. Regardless of the differences in their legal approach, the common thread that runs through all these cases is that chattels found in total constructive loss should generally be replaced and not repaired.

22     Another prevalent theme of the Plaintiff’s case is its criticism of the Defendant’s conduct. The Plaintiff blamed the Defendant for not raising the issue of constructive total loss prior to the commencement of the repair works despite having allegedly conducted a pre-repair inspection. A dispute arose as to whether the pre-repair inspection did take place. The Defendant took the position that the Plaintiff had not duly proven the allegation. In my judgment, even assuming that the Defendant has conducted a pre-repair inspection, the Plaintiff – in order to make good its case – still has to cross the additional hurdle of establishing that the Defendant has a _legal duty_ to advise the Plaintiff of its claim. Beyond that, the Plaintiff also has to establish that the failure to discharge that supposed duty extinguishes the Defendant’s right to defend the action. These appear to be rather extraordinary propositions which I would have expected the Plaintiff to substantiate with legal authority or analogous precedents. None was however cited by the Plaintiff.

23     I note parenthetically that the Pre-action Protocol for Non-Injury Motor Accident Cases found in Appendix C to the State Courts Practice Directions provides at paragraph 2.10 that “once the pre-repair survey has been conducted, the claimant and the insurer shall negotiate and, as far as possible, come to an agreement on the cost of repairing the claimant’s vehicle”. One may argue that this provision imposes a duty on the defendant’s insurer to inform the claimant of its views on the cost of repair. While the Plaintiff did not attempt to rely on this provision in his submissions, I foresee formidable difficulties if he had tried to do so.

24     First of all, with the current version of the said protocol taking effect in 2016, it is not clear whether the same provision appeared in the iteration of the protocol that was in force at the time of the accident in 2014. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the same provision did appear in the previous iteration of the said protocol, and also assuming that the Defendant was in breach that provision, it does not necessarily follow that such breach would have the legal effect of depriving the Defendant’s right to defend the action. To do so is to erroneously elevate the provision to become a rule of law. It is trite that practice directions do not carry the force of law and cannot override statutory or common law. This was definitively decided in _South East Enterprises (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hean Nerng Holdings Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 864</span> where the High Court ruled that practice directions are not binding law (at \[61\]). In that case, it was found that the bailiff was under no binding legal duty to comply with the practice directions (at \[62\]). In doing so, the court followed _Odex Pte Ltd v Pacific Internet Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 18</span> which held that the practice directions did not purport to create additional rights and did not have the force of law (at \[29\]).

25     In any event, nothing in the said protocol prescribes that a breach of its provisions would have the effect of depriving defendants of the right to defend the action. A breach of the protocol is often cited as a factor that is relevant to the court’s exercise of its powers to issue interlocutory directions and its discretion to impose costs. This is evident from paragraph 1.1 of the protocol which reads:

> 1.1    The object of this protocol is to prescribe reasonable conduct for non-injury motor accident claims. It prescribes a framework for pre-writ negotiation and exchange of information. In exercising its discretion and powers, the court will have regard to compliance with this protocol or lack thereof; see, for example, Order 25, Rules 1, 1A and 8, Order 34A, Rule 1, Order 59, Rule 5, and Order 59 Appendix 2, of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5).

26     The reference to the court’s “powers” obviously refers to those that the court already has under general law. It does not purport to confer upon the court fresh “powers”, in the legal sense of the word. The pre-action protocol serves to guide and inform parties and the court of the relevant factors that may go towards to the exercise of the court’s discretion in dispensing the existing powers it already has. For instance, amongst the provisions expressly cited in the paragraph, Orders 25 and 34A of the Rules of Court gives the court the powers to make orders and give directions for the purposes of convening a trial. A breach of the pre-action protocol may therefore be taken into account when the court issues interlocutory directions for instance. Order 59 r 5(d), another provision expressly cited in the paragraph, expressly provides that the court, in exercising its discretion as to costs, shall take into account “the extent to which parties have followed any relevant pre-action protocol or practice direction for the time being issued by the Registrar”. There is nothing in the said protocol that gives the court the power to deprive the defendant of his right to defend an action by reason of non-compliance with the said protocol.

27     It is one thing to penalise a defendant for his failure to comply with the protocol by imposing an adverse cost order, but quite another to deprive him of his right to defend the action. For the latter to take effect, there should be express legislative provisions to unequivocally override the common law position on a defendant’s right to defend an action. In the absence of that, I would have to assess damages in accordance with the general legal principles.

28     Next, the Plaintiff argues that the Defendant failed to put its case of the lorry being in constructive total loss to the _repairer and surveyor_. This, he argued, violated the cardinal rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 which requires witnesses be given an opportunity to address and explain allegations made to contradict or undermine their evidence. I find no merit in this argument for several reasons. First, the Plaintiff omits to mention that the Defendant did put its case to the Plaintiff himself, and that is what matters. The onus is on the Plaintiff, as the claimant in this action, to assess whether it was economically viable to repair the lorry. The Plaintiff was cross-examined on the lorry being uneconomical to repair. It was put to him that he took no steps to find a suitable replacement, despite knowing that the annual depreciation of the lorry was between $3,000 to $8,000 a year and that the lorry would be decommissioned in two years. He conceded during cross-examination that he proceeded with the repair without regard for how much it would cost. He further revealed that the thought of finding a replacement at a lower cost did not cross his mind. In any event, the evidence given by the repairer and surveyor did not even touch on the issue of whether the lorry was in constructive total loss. The repairer’s evidence was confined to the methodology of the repair without anything being said about the subject lorry being economical to repair. It is obvious that he was not called to give his opinion on the issue of constructive total loss. The same can be said for the surveyor, who gave evidence on the estimated cost of repair. Again, he gave no opinion on whether the subject lorry was economical to repair. In fact, the Defendant actually offered him an opportunity to comment on Mr Lum’s report during cross-examination, to which he said he had not been shown a copy. Since neither the repairer nor the surveyor gave evidence on the issue of constructive total loss, there was nothing in their evidence that the Defendant had to give them an opportunity to address or explain insofar as this issue is concerned. Accordingly, the Defendant could not be said to have fallen foul of the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ when it decided not to cross-examine the repairer and surveyor on this issue.

29     The final plank of the Plaintiff’s case is that the duty to mitigate was not specifically pleaded and particularised. He relied on _Yip Holdings_ for the proposition that mitigation of damages must be properly pleaded (_Yip Holdings_ at \[23\]). The purpose of this is to inform the aggrieved party of the allegations of unreasonable action or inaction that he has to meet at trial. Where no pleadings are filed by the defendant, a defendant should give written notice to the plaintiff before the assessment of damages hearing (_Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> at \[100\]). Even assuming the principle of mitigation is irrelevant to the analysis, the Defendant could not deny that it had failed to plead the issue of constructive total loss. As this issue was raised only in the Plaintiff’s written reply submissions, I called for a hearing to seek clarification. At the hearing, counsel for the Defendant, Ms Foo Yuk Lan (“Ms Foo”), took the view that the Plaintiff was fully aware of that constructive total loss was a live issue. She explained that the Plaintiff would have been put on notice as early as 11 months before the hearing, when Mr Melvin Lum first canvassed this as an issue in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief filed then. The same issue was reiterated in the Defendant’s Opening Statement filed shortly before the first hearing. To put beyond doubt that the Plaintiff would have had adequate notice of this issue, Ms Foo points out that even the Plaintiff himself had acknowledged, in his Opening Statement, that the primary issue to be determined is whether the lorry was a constructive total loss. In any event, she emphasised that the Plaintiff, after being cross-examined extensively on this issue at the first hearing, had ample opportunity to lead further evidence in between the several tranches of this hearing convened across the next 10 months. In reply, counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Paul Yap (“Mr Yap”), promptly (and in my view rightly) conceded this point, confirming on record that he would no longer be pursuing this procedural objection. In these circumstances, I give no weight to the Defendant’s failure to plead the issue of mitigation or constructive total loss.

30     In sum, I find that the cost of repairing the lorry ($55,105) had far exceeded its replacement cost ($6,181). The Plaintiff gave no good reason for unreasonably repairing the lorry for such an exorbitant sum. Since the lorry was a constructive total loss, the Plaintiff’s damages should be confined to its replacement cost.

## Pre-judgment interest

31     Whether the Plaintiff was entitled to recover pre-judgment interest on the damages awarded emerged as the other bone of contention in the parties’ written submissions. The Defendant submits that the court should not award interest on the damages awarded because the Plaintiff was not kept out of his money, in view of the arrangement he had made with the repairer. To recap, the arrangement allowed the repairer to perform repairs as he deemed fit without requiring the Plaintiff to pay for the repair cost, on the understanding that the repairer would be able to claim the repair costs against the Defendant in the name of the Plaintiff. This arrangement also led the repairer to procure a 15-day rental of a replacement lorry for the Plaintiff’s use when the subject lorry was undergoing repair. It was undisputed that the Plaintiff did not and would not have to pay for the repair costs and the rental fee, regardless of the outcome of this action. All such costs and fees were borne by the repairer.

32      _Giles v Thompson_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 WLR 908</span> (“_Giles_”) was cited in support of the Defendant’s case. In that case, the claimants sustained injuries and damage to their motor cars in accidents made responsible by the defendants. The claimants entered into agreements with car hire companies specialising in hiring cars to persons whose cars were damaged by third parties for the duration that their cars were undergoing repair. The agreements provided that the companies would have the right to pursue actions against the defendants in the name of the plaintiffs for the companies’ hire charges, and this the companies did in that case. One of the issues was whether a claimant who obtains an award for damages in respect of the hire charges could also obtain an award for pre-judgment interest on the damages awarded. The House of Lords refused to grant pre-judgment interest on the ground that she had not been deprived of any money of her own until her claim against the defendant had been concluded. Lord Mustill, delivering the leading judgment of the House of Lords, explained:

> … \[T\]he power to award interest is discretionary, and … the exercise of this power should correspond with reality. In the present case, although the motorist incurred a genuine liability for the hire charges day by day, it was not a liability capable of immediate enforcement by the hire company. In both practical and equal terms the financial position of the motorist was wholly unaffected by the defendant’s failure to make immediate payment, since the terms of the contract meant that until judgment was given she was not obliged to pay the hiring charges and also that as soon as the claim was “concluded” and the period of credit came to an end the damages provided the necessary funds. In reality she was not “kept out of” any money of her own whilst the claim was being assessed and litigated.

33     There is certainly much force in Lord Mustill’s illuminating analysis. What Lord Mustill was essentially saying is that the claimant, having been fully indemnified of the hire charges by the company until she obtains judgment, was not “out of pocket” for the damages suffered as she would had the company not provided that indemnity. It was the company who had lost the use of its money while the litigation was underway. But the company was not entitled to recover pre-judgment interest against the defendant because the action was not brought in its name. In my view, this analysis comports with the underlying purpose of awarding pre-judgment interest which is to compensate _claimants_ for the cost of being kept out of use of _their_ money (see _Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd v Bank of India_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1308</span> (“_GRIPT_”) at \[137\]). The rule necessarily presupposes that the claimant could have put the money into use. If what transpires is that the claimant would not have been able to put the money into use for himself even if he were paid promptly, the compensatory justification naturally falls away.

34     The present facts are broadly similar to the situation in _Giles v Thompson_. Having been indemnified of the losses by the repairer, the Plaintiff did not have to fork out any money of his own to repair or restore the subject lorry. Had the Plaintiff received payment of the damages shortly after the accident, he would have had to transfer it to the repairer in accordance with their agreement. It was not possible for him to spend it on repairing or restoring the subject lorry, since the repairs were fully funded by the repairer and the subject lorry had been restored to its pre-accident condition. In reality, it was the _repairer_ who lost the opportunity to use _his_ money pending the resolution of this action. But the repairer is not a party to this action, and hence it is not entitled to recover pre-judgment interest against the Defendant. In practical terms, the Plaintiff suffered no loss of opportunity to use the money.

35      _Harbutt’s “Plasticine” Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1970\] 1 QB 447</span> (“_Wayne Tank_”) is another case where the court exercised its discretion against awarding pre-judgment interest for the portion of the claimant’s losses that were indemnified by a third party. The claimant’s factory in this case was completely gutted by fire. After receiving some monies from their insurance company, the claimant went on to build a new factory. Through investigations the claimant later on realised that the fire was caused by the defendant. The claimant sued the defendant for negligence and succeeded in obtaining judgment on the cost of rebuilding the factory. On the issue of pre-judgment interest, the court had to consider whether interest should be awarded on the sums which the claimants had received from the insurance company. The English Court of Appeal held that the reality of the claimant not having lost the use of money to the extent that its damages were indemnified could not be ignored. Lord Denning pithily reasoned as follows (at 468):

> The plaintiffs received considerable sums from their insurance company soon after the fire: £50,000 within eight weeks, and so forth. Are those to be taken into account in awarding interest? The plaintiffs say that the court should ignore the fact that they were insured, or have received insurance moneys, and should give them full interest as if they had paid the cost of replacement out of their own pocket or borrowed money for the purpose. I think this goes too far. In assessing damages, we ignore, of course, the fact that the plaintiffs are insured. But, in awarding interest, it is different. An award of interest is discretionary. It seems to me that the basis of an award of interest is that the defendant has kept the plaintiff out of his money; and the defendant has had the use of it himself. So he ought to compensate the plaintiff accordingly.

> This reasoning does not apply when the plaintiff has not been kept out of his money but has in fact been indemnified by an insurance company. I do not think the plaintiff should recover interest for himself on the money when he has not been kept out of it. The receipt from the insurance company should go in relief of the defendants. The wind should be tempered to the shorn lamb. The judge did relieve the defendants somewhat, but he did not do it very scientifically. I would prefer to ask him to reassess it. He should take the date when the defendants ought in all the circumstances to have paid the sum awarded (such as the letter before action or the writ) and make them pay interest from that date, but he should take into account the fact that the plaintiffs had already received substantial sums from the insurance company: and award interest on the balance only. That would be, I expect, a great deal less than the £26,385 which he did award.

36     The Plaintiff does not seriously disagree with the contention that, in reality, it was the repairer who suffered the loss of opportunity to use his money. Two broad arguments were raised to persuade this court that pre-judgment interest should nevertheless be awarded:

> (a)     first, the court should take into account the fact that the Defendant’s insurers enjoyed the use of the money while this litigation was underway; and

> (b)     second, the Plaintiff and the repairer have been kept out of their rightful compensation for over six years since the accident occurred. The Defendant’s insurers, who have taken a long time to resolve the case, should be penalised by way of pre-judgment interest. He added that if insurers are allowed to drag out proceedings without penalty, there would be almost no incentive for early settlement.

37     The second submission can be readily disposed of and I propose to address that first. The oft-cited rationale for awarding pre-judgment interest is _compensatory_ in nature. It serves to compensate claimants for losing the time value of money that they would have otherwise benefitted from had the debt or damages been paid promptly when they fell due (see for instance _GRIPT_ at \[137\] and _Lee Soon Beng v Wee Tiam Sing_ <span class="citation">\[1985–1986\] SLR(R) 799</span> at \[7\]). The Plaintiff cited no authority that says pre-judgment interest is meant to serve as a _penalty_. The spectre of being slapped with pre-judgment interest may have the effect of disincentivising defendants from stretching out litigation, but to say that it is designed to punish defendants for a long drawn litigation – without regard for whether the delay is attributable to their conduct – is a different matter altogether. The latter assertion is unsupported by logic and authority. As regards the concern that insurers may drag out proceedings, the imposition of adverse costs orders and peremptory orders serve as the usual deterrent and punishment. The assumption that insurers can drag out proceedings “without penalty” is therefore incorrect. In any event, it is perhaps more significant that the Plaintiff is not even asserting that the Defendant had engaged in dilatory conduct. All he is saying is that the matter has taken a long time to resolve. But that delay may be partly attributed to the Plaintiff, who commenced the present action more than 3½ years after the accident. The Plaintiff also adduced no evidence to show that the Defendant had delayed the proceedings. The present facts therefore does not justify awarding pre-judgment interest for the rationale cited, _viz_. to punish the Defendant, even if that rationale could be said to be legitimate.

38     The Plaintiff’s first submission is less straightforward. It proceeds on the footing that the award of pre-judgment interest is intended to be restitutionary, namely to prevent the unjust enrichment of the defendant, as opposed to being compensatory, in the sense that it puts the claimant in the position he would have been had the damages been paid when they fell due. But he tendered no authority to that effect. Against this, the English Court of Appeal expressly refused to characterise pre-judgment interest as a restitutionary remedy. In _Sempra Metals Ltd (formerly Metallgesellschaft Ltd) v Inland Revenue Commissioners_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] QB 37</span> (“_Sempra Metals (CA)_”) at \[46\], Chadwick LJ observed in the English Court of Appeal that:

> 46    … \[T\]he ostensible object of an award of interest under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 is to compensate the claimant for the loss of the use of money. An award under that section is not made in order to prevent the unjust enrichment of the defendant – although it may have that effect. …

39     To provide some context to this passage, s 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (presently called the Senior Courts Act 1981) (“UK SCA”) is the relevant provision that gives English courts the power to grant pre-judgment interest. As explained in _GRIPT_ at \[137\], courts traditionally had no power to award interest under common law for the late payment of debt or damages until legislative reform culminated in the codification of that power in the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 (“UK 1934 Act”) which gave the court a general discretion to award pre-judgment interest on debts and damages. The modern equivalent of that provision is s 35A of the UK SCA. In Singapore, the power is similarly codified statutorily in s 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed). The two provisions are _in pari materia_ and similarly worded.

40     Chadwick LJ’s comments were however _dicta_. Whether interest on a restitutionary basis could be awarded under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 was not the issue that the court was asked to determine. The claimant in that case claimed interest as a principal sum on the basis of unjust enrichment as a freestanding cause of action, as opposed to interest under s 35 of the UK SCA that may be awarded at the end of legal proceedings, because the claimant had effectively been repaid of the monies that were wrongly paid to the defendant prior to the onset of legal proceedings. When the matter reached the House of Lords, the majority held that it had the jurisdiction at common law or in equity to award interest on the monies on the ground of unjust enrichment (_Sempra Metals Ltd (formerly Metallgesellschaft Ltd) v Inland Revenue Commissioners and another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 AC 561</span> (“_Sempra Metals (HL)_”). The majority took the view that the cause of action lay in the opportunity to use the money obtained by the defendant, quantified by reference to the cost of borrowing the amount in question for the relevant period. The minority took the view that the cause of action was contingent upon the proof of actual benefit acquired by the defendant. Both the majority and minority however left open the precise relationship between interest awardable under s 35A of the UK SCA and interest awardable at common law or in equity. It was not necessary for the court to take a firm position on s 35A of the UK SCA ostensibly because that provision was “not an exhaustive code” and did not “displace any jurisdiction the courts themselves have to award interest” (at \[98\] _per_ Lord Nicholls; see also \[114\]).

41     The majority ruling in _Sempra Metals (HL)_ did not sit well with a different coram. A decade or so later, the UK Supreme Court unanimously decided to depart from that ruling in _Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners_ \[2019\] AC 929 (“_Prudential_”), holding that the majority was wrong to have awarded interest on the ground of unjust enrichment. The court in _Prudential_ held that the opportunity to use the money did not constitute a “transfer of value”, which in its view was a requisite element to the cause of action, and the majority in _Sempra Metals (HL)_ was wrong to have held that the requirement was met (at \[70\] and \[73\]-\[75\]). The decision in _Prudential_ has however also attracted academic criticisms of its own (see for instance Andrew Burrows, _In Defence of Unjust Enrichment_, The Cambridge Law Journal, Vol. 78, Issue 3 (November 2019)), and in my view may not represent the final position on what may be regarded as a controversial topic in an evolving area of English jurisprudence.

42     Locally, this appears to be the first time this issue has arisen for consideration in a reported decision. Insofar as statutory interest under s 12 of the Civil Law Act is concerned, I am not inclined to dismiss the notion that the court has the power to award pre-judgment interest on a restitutionary basis in appropriate circumstances. In my view, guidance can be sought from the seminal statement on pre-judgment interest made by Lord Herschell in _London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co v South Eastern Railway_ <span class="citation">\[1893\] AC 429</span> at 437 more than a century ago where he alluded to the restitutionary rationale in the following terms:

> … I think that when money is owing from one party to another and that other is driven to have recourse to legal proceedings in order to recover the amount due to him, _the party who is wrongfully withholding the money from the other ought not in justice to benefit by having that money in his possession and enjoying the use of it_, when the money ought to be in the possession of the other party who is entitled to its use. Therefore, if I could see my way to do so, I should certainly be disposed to give the appellants, or anybody in a similar position, interest upon the amount withheld from the time of action brought at all events.

> \[emphasis added\]

43     As the House of Lords in that case took the view that common law at that time did not provide a general power to award pre-judgment interest, Lord Herschell’s observations were not law but merely, as Lord Denning later on observed, the legal principles that “he thought should be applied”. Eventually those statements laid the building blocks for law reform, with the Law Revision Committee reproducing them in the report that led to the UK 1934 Act and expressly stating that the purpose of the proposed statute was to “effect the reform which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Herschell, thought that justice required” (see _Jefford v Gee_ <span class="citation">\[1970\] 2 QB 130</span> at 143-144). Lord Denning concluded that the UK 1934 Act may be regarded to have given statutory effect to Lord Herschell’s statement. Though Lord Denning did not go as far as to construe Lord Herschell’s statement as an endorsement of the restitutionary rationale, in my view an argument can be made that both compensatory and restitutionary objectives were encapsulated in his statement (see Law Reform Committee, Singapore Academy of Law, _Report of the Law Reform Committee on Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest_ (August 2005) (“_Law Reform Report_”) at para 2). I also note that the authors of the _Law Reform Report_ sought to rationalise the relevant principles this way:

> \[04\]  In general, a party may be entitled to interest on the compensatory or restitutionary principle. Generally, where there is a statutory discretionary power to award to consider \[_sic_\], both compensatory and restitutionary principles have relevant bearings on the judicial discretion involved in the decision of whether and how much interest is to be awarded. _Which principle is the more significant in the circumstances may depend on whether the basis of the underlying claim is seen to be compensatory or restitutionary._

> \[emphasis added\]

44     That said, it is not necessary for me to express a definitive view on this issue in the present case. I say this because even assuming that the court can award restitutionary pre-judgment interest where the circumstances justifies, I am not persuaded that this is one such case. Insofar as the present facts are concerned, the decisions in _Giles_ and _Wayne Tank_ militate against the application of the restitutionary rationale. Both courts decided against awarding pre-judgment interest for the reasons mentioned above even though the defendants presumably would have had the benefit of using the money that was eventually awarded as damages while the litigation was underway. The present facts cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the two cases. I also note that the underlying claim in the present case, like _Giles_ and _Wayne Tank_, is not made on the basis of unjust enrichment, which may be another factor weighing against pre-judgment interest being awarded on a restitutionary basis.

45     Beyond that, even assuming the Defendant had the benefit of using the money, the Plaintiff has not established that such benefits were obtained _at the expense of_ the Plaintiff. A claimant suing for unjust enrichment must prove that the defendant received the benefits at his expense, and the Singapore Court of Appeal has held that this requires the Plaintiff to prove that that he had “lost a benefit to which she is _legally entitled or which forms part of her assets_ and which is reflected in the recipient’s gain” (_Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 801</span> at \[128\]; see also the High Court’s holding in _Anuva Technologies Pte Ltd v Advanced Sierra Electrotech Private Limited_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 244</span> at \[91\]). For the reasons stated at \[34\] above, I find it hard to accept that the Plaintiff had suffered any loss of use of the money now awarded as damages. In these circumstances, I am not prepared to exercise my discretion in favour of awarding pre-judgment interest.

## Conclusion

46     In conclusion, the Plaintiff’s damages are assessed at $6,181, being the cost of acquiring a replacement lorry from the open market. The Defendant also conceded that it is liable to compensate the Plaintiff for the loss of use of the subject lorry after the accident in the sum of $3,000 (comprising 15 days of renting a replacement lorry at $200 per day). The amount claimed by the Plaintiff ($3,210) includes a 7% GST paid to the rental company. Since the Defendant did not challenge this amount in its reply submissions, I assess the damages for the loss of use claim at $3,210. I award no pre-judgment interest on the damages awarded.

47     I will hear parties on the issue of costs and consequential directions.
