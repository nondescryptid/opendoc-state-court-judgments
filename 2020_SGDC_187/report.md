Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases

14 August 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Lim Wen Juin:

1       This is an assessment of damages in a motor accident case. The plaintiff sustained personal injuries in a collision between the motorcycle he was riding and the defendant’s car that took place on 12 August 2014. Pursuant to a consent interlocutory judgment dated 11 July 2017 the defendant is to pay 100% of the damages assessed to be due to the plaintiff.

## The medical evidence and the plaintiff’s injuries

2       At the outset I give some account of the proceedings before me because it has a bearing on the treatment of the medical reports that are relied on as expert evidence. The examination of the plaintiff took place over half a day on 16 January 2020. The completion of the plaintiff’s examination at that hearing brought the giving of factual evidence to a close because neither the plaintiff nor the defendant had any other witnesses of fact to call. This left only the expert evidence from the medical doctors. Counsel for the defendant Ms Renuka d/o Karuppan Chettiar informed me at the end of that hearing that the defendant might be prepared to dispense with examination of all the doctors. The following week Ms Renuka wrote to court to confirm that the defendant did not need any of the doctors to attend court for cross-examination. Thus I considered parties to have closed their cases and gave directions for written submissions.

3       On 10 February 2020 the plaintiff filed a notice of change of solicitor – he had been represented by Ms Manickam Kasturibai (of East Asia Law Corporation) but from that point on Mr Goh E Pei acted for him. At a case conference on 20 February 2020 Mr Goh told me that the plaintiff was seeking leave to call two of the doctors for examination in court so that they might clarify the medical reports they had authored. Ms Renuka objected to this on the basis that it was an attempt by the plaintiff to bring in more evidence by the back door after parties had closed their cases. I agreed with Ms Renuka. Given that the doctors were the plaintiff’s expert witnesses and not joint experts, I thought that the plaintiff would not have been entitled to adduce evidence from them prior to cross-examination. This meant that the effect of the defendant choosing not to cross-examine the doctors was that no further evidence could be called from them and the plaintiff’s case had closed. While I was not prepared at that point to grant the plaintiff the leave sought I did not think I could prevent him from putting in a formal application to re-open his case, and so I directed that any such application be filed by 19 March 2020, failing which written submissions should be filed and exchanged by 24 April 2020. The plaintiff did not file an application to re-open his case. Following a few extensions of time parties filed their written submissions, the plaintiff doing so on 21 July 2020 and the defendant on 24 July 2020. Reply submissions were then made orally at a hearing conducted by way of video conferencing on 11 August 2020.

4       In relation to the expert evidence the result of this procedural history is two-fold. First, the defendant is taken to have accepted the correctness of the contents of the medical reports, and second, the medical reports constitute the entirety of the expert evidence before me.

5       It appears from the medical reports that the main injury that the plaintiff sustained as a result of the accident was a “severe comminuted fracture of his left femur”: see the medical report of Dr Poon Kein Boon dated 28 March 2015. The same medical report also mentions that the plaintiff sustained an “acute comminuted left intertrochanteric fracture with subtrochanteric extension”, but I understand this to be a more precise and detailed description of the left femur fracture and not a reference to an additional distinct injury. It is not disputed that this left femur fracture led to (a) shortening of the plaintiff’s left leg such that it is now 2 cm shorter than his right leg, (b) muscle wasting in his left thigh, and (c) chronic or “persistent pain secondary to nerve injuries” and “complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)” of his “left foot and ankle”: see the medical report of A/Prof Yoong Chee Seng dated 28 September 2017.

6       In addition to this main injury the plaintiff also sustained an abrasion on his left knee measuring 1 cm by 2 cm and scarring on his left knee and left thigh. It seems that the scarring was a consequence of the abrasion as well as the surgery that he underwent for the left femur fracture.

## General damages for pain and suffering

### Severe comminuted fracture of left femur

7       Although the plaintiff’s position in written submissions was that he had sustained a hip fracture as well as a femur fracture, I understood Mr Goh to accept at the hearing for reply submissions that there had in fact been a single fracture around the junction of the hip and the femur. Nonetheless Mr Goh maintained his written submission of $120,000 as general damages for pain and suffering caused by the femur fracture. Parties agree that the chronic pain and CRPS that resulted from the fracture should be the subject of a separate award.

8       There is no doubt that the fracture that the plaintiff sustained was a serious one that resulted in significant physical damage and pain and suffering. It was a comminuted fracture, meaning that the bone broke into multiple pieces – as Dr Poon put it in his report dated 28 March 2015, there were “\[m\]ultiple displaced fractured fragments”. It necessitated surgery: the day after the accident the plaintiff had to undergo a “left femur open reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary nail”. And although the fracture has healed it has had substantial long-term effects, in that it has shortened the plaintiff’s left leg by 2 cm and so made it necessary for him to wear a raised insole to correct his gait, and it has also caused muscle wasting in his left thigh.

9       But I agree with Ms Renuka’s contention that an award of $120,000 would be wholly excessive given the sums awarded for comparable injuries in the precedents and given also the ranges set out in the _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“_Guidelines_”). Turning first to the _Guidelines_, the range suggested for an “\[a\]bove-knee amputation of one leg” is $42,000 to $80,000 (at p 48). I would think that even the most severe leg fracture is generally not as serious as losing the leg entirely, hence I do not think it appropriate to venture beyond the upper limit of that range. The plaintiff’s femur fracture seems to me to belong under the heading “Severe leg injuries”, specifically either to the category of “Moderate injuries which include open and/or compound fractures” and that contemplates in the more serious cases longer-term effects including “muscle wasting” and “restricted movement”, for which the suggested range of awards is $15,000 to $25,000, or to the category of “Serious and/or multiple fractures leading to restricted mobility, deformity and/or shortening of limbs” with likely “significant disabilities on a long-term basis that will significantly affect his chances of finding employment and his social life as well”, for which the recommended range is $30,000 to $40,000 (both at p 49). The defendant submits that the fracture might even belong to a category for which the range of $10,000 to $15,000 is suggested, namely that of fractures under the heading “Moderate to minor leg injuries” where there are “some residual disabilities such as a defective gait, limp, sensory loss, discomfort or exacerbation of a pre-existing disability”, such residual disabilities being “unlikely to resolve even in the long run”. But I think it would be generally inapt to describe a comminuted fracture as the plaintiff’s was as merely a “\[m\]oderate to minor” one.

10     As for the precedents, parties refer to the following cases:

> (a)      _Nursarina bte Salim v Noorhakem bin Kamil_ (DC Suit No 158 of 2003) (“_Nursarina_”), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (LexisNexis, 3rd ed, 2017) (“_Practitioners’ Library_”) at p 828, in which $27,000 was awarded for a “Garden’s grade 4 fracture of neck of left femur” requiring treatment that included “\[o\]pen reduction and internal fixation” and possibly also bone grafting;

> (b)      _Chiam Kim Loke v Lee Wing Hoong and another_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 37</span> (“_Chiam_”), in which $35,000 was awarded for a “severe open comminuted fracture of the right femur involving the condyle” that resulted in shortening of the leg by 6 cm (later reduced to 1.5 cm to 2 cm), caused the plaintiff to have difficulty walking, running and squatting, and gave rise to a “substantial” risk of osteoarthritis (at \[3\]);

> (c)      _Loh Chia Mei v Koh Kok Han_ (High Court Suit 564 of 2007) (“_Loh Chia Mei_”), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library_ at p 821, in which $25,000 was awarded for an open fracture “of the shaft of left femur (Grade 2)” leading to a shortening of the leg by 1.5 cm, and for which bone grafting was required due to non-union, and $22,000 was awarded for an “\[u\]ndisplaced fracture of left neck femur”;

> (d)      _Loh Chee Wang v Ong Leong Chye_ (DC Suit No 4300 of 2003) (“_Loh Chee Wang_”), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library_ at p 831, in which $22,000 was awarded for a fracture “of neck of left femur” that resulted in shortening in the leg by 1.5 cm, an inability to squat, a “\[l\]imping gait with pain in left hip”, and wasting of the quadriceps and calf muscles in the left leg;

> (e)      _Hamzah Bin Moideen v Sahril Bin Zakariah_ (High Court Suit No 362 of 2008) (“_Hamzah_”), summarised in _Practitioners’ Library_ at pp 825–826, in which $22,000 was awarded for a fracture “of the neck at the right femur with severe pain in right hip (including osteoarthritis)”.

11     Relying on _Loh Chee Wang_ and _Hamzah_, Ms Renuka submits that the award for the plaintiff’s femur fracture should not exceed $25,000. She argues that the plaintiff’s injury was less serious than the femur fractures in _Nursarina_, _Chiam_ and _Loh Chia Mei_: in _Nursarina_ more extensive treatment was required in the form of bone grafting; in _Loh Chia Mei_ the injury was an open fracture in contrast to the closed fracture sustained by the plaintiff in this case, the difference being that an open fracture involves a break in the skin and necessarily entails more significant damage to the flesh and tissue around the broken bone; and in _Chiam_ the injury was likewise an open fracture and that led to more pronounced shortening of the injured leg than in this case.

12     I am in broad agreement with Ms Renuka’s submissions, except that I think that the age of the precedents ought to be taken into account. The assessments of damages in _Nursarina_, _Chiam_ and _Loh Chee Wang_ took place in 2004, and those in _Loh Chia Mei_ and _Hamzah_ took place in 2009. More than a decade has since elapsed. I do not think it can be disputed that any given numerical amount of money loses value over time by reason of inflation. The same sums awarded in those precedents would be substantially less valuable today, meaning that in order to achieve today a degree of compensation similar to that thought appropriate for comparable pain and suffering in a precedent from years ago, I ought to award a higher sum than was awarded in that precedent. Hence, while Ms Renuka is correct to say that the precedents point towards an award for pain and suffering in the region of $25,000, I consider that this refers to $25,000 a decade or so ago and some form of uplift is warranted given that $25,000 is worth less today than it was then. Using a broad brush I add 10% to 15% and take the round figure in between and so assess general damages for pain and suffering caused by the femur fracture at $28,000. I am satisfied that this is not out of line with the ranges set out in the _Guidelines_.

### Chronic pain and CRPS

13     As to the chronic pain and CRPS to which the femur fracture gave rise, both parties refer to the part of the _Guidelines_ under the heading “Chronic Pain Syndrome” but take different positions on the precise classification of the plaintiff’s condition under that heading. In submitting that the award should be $50,000 the plaintiff effectively argues that his chronic pain and CRPS goes beyond even the “Severe” category for which the suggested range is $20,000 to $35,000, whereas the defendant contends that it should instead be placed within the “Moderate” category for which the suggested range is $10,000 to $20,000 and submits that the award should not exceed $15,000.

14     On the basis of A/Prof Yoong’s medical report dated 28 September 2017 there is no doubt that as at late May 2015, more than nine months after the accident, the plaintiff was complaining of “severe persistent pain (average pain score 7/10) and numbness over the left lower limb, especially the left foot and ankle”. The plaintiff described the pain as “constant, squeezing and sharp, and worsened with movements”, and reported that it had had “significant effect” on “walking, sleep and enjoyment of life”. The plaintiff told A/Prof Yoong that he “had to continue with the strong analgesics” notwithstanding the side effects including “medication-induced lethargy”. The plaintiff returned for several follow-up medical consultations at the Changi General Hospital Pain Clinic, the last of which occurred on 27 July 2017, and A/Prof Yoong records that at these consultations the plaintiff consistently said that the pain in his left lower limb was “persistent, but manageable with the medications”. The plaintiff reported “lethargy and bloatedness” which A/Prof Yoong considered was “possibly secondary to the oral pain medications”, but despite those effects and A/Prof Yoong’s advice to “taper off the opoid medications” the plaintiff insisted on continuing to take medication at “relatively low doses” because that had “provided significant relief of pain and improved physical function”. At the final consultation of 27 July 2017, the plaintiff told A/Prof Yoong that his pain was “under control” and that he “could participate in daily physical activities”.

15     I have no reason to think that the plaintiff’s account of his pain was untrue in any way. To the contrary, the fact that he continued regularly to take painkillers in spite of their side effects, and to undergo physiotherapy, leads me to find that the accident caused him to suffer “persistent” pain in his lower left leg that was “severe” enough to reduce significantly the overall quality of his life for a duration of nine months to a year, followed by approximately two years of pain that remained “persistent” but was sufficiently diminished in intensity that it was “manageable” with painkillers. I find also that since then the pain has become bearable enough that it does not substantially interfere with the plaintiff’s ability to lead his life normally but only because he continues to take medication to reduce the pain – the medical invoices and receipts produced in evidence show that up to the time he swore his affidavit of evidence-in-chief in August 2018 he was purchasing painkillers on a regular basis. I think these findings are corroborated by the fact that when the plaintiff saw a psychiatrist “for the first and only time” on 2 November 2017 he was “deemed to suffer from Chronic Adjustment Disorder due to the persistent pain symptoms” caused by the accident “as well as his disappointment at being unable to work efficiently in his job” by reason of the side effects of the pain medication including “mental slowness”: see the medical report of Dr Abishek Mathew Abraham dated 8 November 2017. In this connection Mr Goh explained at the hearing for reply submissions that the plaintiff was not claiming damages for the “Chronic Adjustment Disorder” as a distinct item of psychiatric injury but submitted that it should be given some weight in my assessment of damages for his chronic pain and CRPS. I agree that this is the correct approach to take given that there is little evidence before me on the “Chronic Adjustment Disorder”.

16     The _Guidelines_ defines “Chronic Pain Syndrome” as pain that lasts beyond the “expected time for recovery of the injured tissue/muscle/bone”, which is “normally taken as three months”. Thus it seems to me that as a starting point the “Mild” category is appropriate for pain of perceptible but manageable intensity that lasts for not more than several months and interferes only minimally with general enjoyment of life. On the premise that the highest end of the range recommended for the “Severe” category would be reserved for cases of severe and constant pain that persists for years, even decades, and hinders the injured person’s ability to lead a normal life, I consider that the “Moderate” category is apt for perceptible but manageable pain that lasts for years or pain of severe intensity that ceases to be felt within the space of several months. Given that the plaintiff’s condition combined severe pain for about a year with manageable pain for about two years after that, and has in addition driven him to consume medication that has unpleasant side effects, I have little hesitation in holding that the plaintiff’s chronic pain and CRPS belongs to the “Severe” category, albeit not at the most serious end of the spectrum. Working within the range of $20,000 to $35,000 I assess damages for this item of injury at $24,000. This yields an aggregate award of $52,000 for a serious femur fracture resulting in significant complications and after-effects, which I think is reasonable overall in view of the suggested range of $42,000 to $80,000 for amputation of a single leg above the knee.

### Abrasions and scarring

17     For the abrasions and scarring sustained by the plaintiff, he submits an award of $12,000 while the defendant submits $3,500, being $500 for the single abrasion on the plaintiff’s left knee and $3,000 for the scarring. I think that the plaintiff’s submission is much too high. One of the justifications advanced by the plaintiff for his proposed award was that the scars “affect the mobility of the legs”, but I do not see in the medical reports any prognosis of that sort. Hence I take the view that the scars have not compromised the plaintiff’s physical functions and that their effects are purely cosmetic in nature.

18     On the basis of Dr Poon’s medical report dated 28 March 2015 I accept that as at 11 March 2015, about seven months after the accident, there were “multiple irregular huge scars over his left knee” as well as “multiple scars on his left thigh which measured 7cm, 3cm and 4cm”. Although the _Guidelines_ sets out a range of $5,000 to $15,000 for the category “Multiple scars”, I do not think that I am thereby compelled to award a minimum of $5,000 just because the plaintiff has more than one scar. To begin with the _Guidelines_ recommends a range of $1,500 to $3,000 for a single scar. To say that no less than $5,000 should be awarded so long as there is more than a single scar is effectively to say that in a case where an injured person has two scars the range for one scar is $1,500 to $3,000 but for the other scar it is at least $2,000 to $3,500. That would be quite anomalous and so I do not think it is the correct position. Moreover, it is apparent from the endnotes to the _Guidelines_ that the sum of $5,000 is based on the High Court precedent _Ang Kuang Hoe v Chia Chor Yew_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 229</span>, and in that case the injured person had “a large number of scars” that included at least one keloid scar of substantial size measuring 18 cm by 1.2 cm: at \[10\]. It therefore appears to me that I am free to award a sum under $5,000 where there are multiple scars but none of them are keloid scars and not one of them is as large as the scar expressly mentioned in that precedent.

19     In this case, there is no suggestion in the medical reports or elsewhere that any of the plaintiff’s scars are keloid scars or are raised above the level of the surrounding skin. Also, while there is no doubt that the scars were present as at 11 March 2015, it is not clear whether there has been any change since – it is conceivably a possibility that the scars have over time blended in with the surrounding skin to a greater extent – and I consider that it is the plaintiff’s burden to prove that the scars continue to affect his appearance in a significant way. The plaintiff’s scars are located on a part of the body that is not particularly conspicuous, and will not be visible at all if clothing is worn that goes below the knee. The _Guidelines_ states that a higher award is warranted where the “injured person is a young female”, but that feature is obviously absent in this case because the plaintiff is male and was 46 years old at the time of the accident. In the circumstances I think it right to go below the minimum amount of $5,000 recommended in the _Guidelines_. An award of $3,500 seems to me adequate to compensate the plaintiff for the relatively limited effects of the scars on his appearance. For the single knee abrasion I agree with Ms Renuka that $500 is sufficient and so damages for pain and suffering caused by the plaintiff’s abrasions and scarring are assessed at a total of $4,000.

## Loss of earnings

### Pre-trial loss of earnings

20     It is not disputed that at the time of the accident the plaintiff was several days away from starting his new job at DBS Bank Ltd (“DBS”). That much is clear from the letter of appointment from DBS, which stated that the plaintiff would start work on 18 August 2014. This letter also stated that DBS would pay the plaintiff a base salary of $11,450 a month and a transport allowance of $950 a month. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he was not able to start work at DBS until November 2014 because of his injuries. He argues that as a consequence he suffered pre-trial loss of earnings in the form of remuneration from DBS that he would otherwise have started receiving from 18 August 2014. He said that although he cannot recall the exact date in November 2014 on which he started work it would have been around the middle of the month and perhaps even near the end of it. But he is content to advance his claim for pre-trial loss of earnings as if he had started work in early November 2014, in that he is seeking a sum equivalent to two and a half months of remuneration from DBS. The plaintiff submits that his monthly loss was $13,420 being the base salary plus transport allowance plus the employer’s CPF contribution of $1,020. He thus submits that damages for pre-trial loss of earnings should be assessed at $33,550.

21     The defendant submits instead a sum of $4,432.26. I do not understand the defendant to dispute that the plaintiff started work at DBS in November 2014 given that his CPF statements show that it was only in that month that he started receiving remuneration from DBS. But the defendant points out that according to the medical certificates that the plaintiff has produced in evidence he was given medical leave up to 12 October 2014 only. Hence the defendant contends that any lost income from 13 October 2014 onwards cannot be blamed on the accident. In addition, the defendant relies on the undisputed fact that in August and September 2014 the plaintiff received payments from Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (“BTM”), which was his last employer before DBS. There is no documentary evidence as to the nature of those payments, and so Ms Renuka contends that the plaintiff has not discharged his burden of proving that he in fact suffered loss of earnings in those months in which he was paid by BTM. The defendant thus submits that the accident caused the plaintiff to lose income only for the 12 days between 1 and 12 October 2014. The defendant also submits that the monthly rate of lost income should not include the transport allowance because the plaintiff would not have incurred any transport expenses when he was not working. The defendant’s submission of $4,432.26 was obtained by dividing the plaintiff’s base salary of $11,450 by the 31 days in October 2014 and multiplying by 12 days.

22     Considering first the duration of the period in which the plaintiff lost income, I agree with the plaintiff that it should be two and a half months and not 12 days as the defendant submitted. Although it is evident that the plaintiff received some payment from his former employer BTM in August and September 2014, I think that he lost earnings in those months nonetheless because if he had started work at DBS on 18 August 2014 as he would have done but for the accident it seems to me more likely than not that he would have received remuneration from DBS in addition to the payment that he in fact received from BTM. In cross-examination the plaintiff explained that the August payment comprised the remnants of his remuneration from BTM while the September payment represented “leave encashment”, that is, compensation from BTM for leave to which he was entitled but did not use during his employment. Ms Renuka quite reasonably argued that the plaintiff can and should have produced documentary proof of the nature of these payments, but the plaintiff’s explanation strikes me as plausible and not to be rejected outright.

23     Looking at the matter sensibly and holistically, I have only to ascertain which of two possibilities is more probable: either BTM would not have made the payments if not for the accident, in which event those payments would count as benefits attributable to the accident and so reduce or negate the loss of income from DBS, or BTM would have made those payments anyway even if the plaintiff had not met with the accident and started work at DBS on 18 August 2014 as planned. Given that the accident occurred less than a week before the plaintiff was supposed to start work at DBS it seems highly unlikely that at the time of the accident the plaintiff remained employed by BTM, and I cannot see any reason why it would voluntarily pay an ex-employee who has been injured in an accident. It thus seems inherently more probable that the plaintiff had become entitled in the course of his employment with BTM to the payments that were then made to him in August and September 2014, meaning that he would have received them anyway even if he had started work at DBS on 18 August 2014. Therefore those payments do not diminish in any way the loss of earnings that he suffered in not starting work at DBS on that date.

24     As for the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff was given medical leave up to 12 October 2014 only and he should thus have started work at DBS on 13 October 2014, meaning that in not doing so he failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate his losses, I am inclined once more to take a more sensible and holistic view of the matter, and on that view it seems very probable given the severe nature of the plaintiff’s injuries that he had not recovered fully by 12 October 2014, which was about two months after the accident. In a medical memorandum dated 17 August 2014 Dr Lim Wen Siang Kevin said that given the severity of the fracture “a long period of recovery post operation” was expected and the plaintiff “will need to be on crutches for at least 3 months, and may take around 6 months to walk normally”. There is also evidence that the recovery period went beyond 12 October 2014 in the fact that on 20 October 2014 the plaintiff “underwent Electromyogram investigation of his left foot” that “reported complex regional pain syndrome”, as Dr Poon recorded in his medical report dated 28 March 2015. I therefore think it more likely than not that the plaintiff was unable to start work at DBS before early November 2014 because he continued to be affected by the injuries caused by the accident. That being so, the plaintiff is entitled to damages for loss of earnings from 13 October to early November 2014, and accordingly he is entitled to damages for loss of earnings for two and a half months from 18 August 2014.

25     Turning then to the monthly rate of lost income, I have no doubt that if the plaintiff had started work at DBS on 18 August 2014 he would have received not only his base salary but also his transport allowance. The starting point then is that the amount of earnings he lost per month includes both those components. That said, it is likely true that in not working from 18 August to November 2014 the plaintiff avoided incurring transport expenses he would otherwise have incurred, and I think a fair way of taking this into account is to set it off against the employer’s CPF contribution that the plaintiff is claiming. As to that I accept that the plaintiff in fact lost the benefit of the employer’s CPF contribution and should in principle receive compensation for this, but I must bear in mind that he would otherwise not have access to the funds in his CPF account until he reaches retirement age more than a decade from now, hence any award in this regard should be significantly discounted from the $1,020 that is the employer’s monthly CPF contribution in order to reflect the benefit of receiving the money as cash now and being able to use it at once. Using a broad brush I do not think the current cash equivalent of the lost CPF contributions should differ by too much from the transport expenses that the plaintiff did not have to incur, and so I set them off entirely one against the other.

26     For these reasons I think that the plaintiff lost two and a half months of income from DBS at a monthly rate of $12,400 being the aggregate of the base salary of $11,450 and the transport allowance of $950. Damages for pre-trial loss of earnings are therefore assessed at $31,000.

### Loss of earning capacity

27     The plaintiff submits that he is entitled to $100,000 for loss of earning capacity (“LEC”). He is not claiming loss of future earnings. The defendant is prepared to accept that there should be an award for LEC but submits that it should not exceed $20,000.

28     It is not disputed that having started work at DBS in November 2014 in the position of “Vice President in Risk Management Group” the plaintiff left DBS in August 2015. According to him he started work at CIMB Bank Berhard (“CIMB”) on 10 October 2015, drawing a salary of $13,500 a month in the position of “Director, Governance & Risk Analytics”, and left CIMB about two years later in September 2017, and thereafter he started work at RHB Bank Berhard (“RHB”) on 24 May 2018, drawing in the position of “Senior Technology Risk Manager” a monthly salary of $12,000, and has been working there since. I understand the defendant to accept this narrative with some minor and ultimately insignificant differences.

29     On the face of the plaintiff’s employment history his injuries from the accident did not prevent him from keeping his job at DBS for about ten months and then securing a higher-paying role at CIMB that he then maintained for a respectable period of two years, and thereafter finding employment at RHB that paid roughly as much as he had received at DBS. In the absence of detailed job descriptions in the evidence I infer from the titles of his positions in his various employers that the nature of his work for DBS, CIMB and RHB shared broadly similar characteristics of executive-level responsibility in banking risk management. I think I can safely assume that the work was desk-bound and not manual in nature. The initial appearance is thus that the injuries did not substantially affect the plaintiff’s ability to work at his pre-accident capacity.

30     The plaintiff however paints a different picture in his evidence. His chief complaint is that the medications he has been taking to cope with the chronic pain have dulled his mental faculties. At DBS he was in the earlier stages of the recovery process and he says that he “was constantly in pain and was also sedated” and so he “could not concentrate and perform \[his\] duties” and his “mind was totally overwhelmed by the ‘kicks’ of the drugs”. He claims that he left DBS because he was “afraid” that he would be “blacklisted” by reason of his poor job performance, the consequence of such blacklisting according to him being that he “will never be accepted in this profession ever again”. The plaintiff says that at CIMB he would while at work similarly feel “like a ‘zombie’ and in a state of ‘high’, unable to concentrate, sedated and unable to relate to the situation or environment”, and the reason he left CIMB was that he “could not continue in the position due to the effects of the drugs”.

31     To a large extent it is not necessary for me to make firm findings as to whether the plaintiff’s injuries hindered his work at DBS and CIMB and caused him to leave their employment. This is because he is not claiming pre-trial loss of earnings beyond what has been discussed above – indeed he could not possibly make such a claim given that he drew his full pay at DBS once he started work there and even enjoyed an increase in income by joining CIMB. In assessing LEC my concern is not so much the plaintiff’s historical work performance as it is his ability to work from this point in time on. But having said that the issue of whether the plaintiff’s injuries affected his ability to work at DBS and CIMB may shed light on the question of whether they are likely to continue to affect him in the future.

32     The plaintiff points to the fact that at his consultation with the psychiatrist on 2 November 2017 he reported being “unable to work efficiently in his job” because the pain medications had deprived him of the “sharpness” that he needed for his work and caused him to experience “‘mental slowness’ that reduced his competency in fulfilling his job obligations”: see Dr Abishek’s medical report dated 8 November 2017. I am prepared to find that the plaintiff’s mental acuity was diminished to a degree by the medication he had to consume to cope with his chronic pain. In truth I do not think that is disputed given that the defendant is not opposed to some award for LEC. But I agree with the defendant’s contention that there is insufficient evidence for me to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the plaintiff’s mental acuity was diminished to so great an extent that he had to resign from DBS and CIMB because he could no longer carry out his job functions there. The plaintiff has not produced any performance appraisals from his employers. He has not produced his resignation letters or any correspondence with his employers relating to his work performance. He saw A/Prof Yoong on several occasions at regular intervals throughout his employment with DBS and CIMB, and during those sessions they discussed the chronic pain the plaintiff was experiencing, yet there is no record in A/Prof Yoong’s commendably detailed and thorough medical report dated 28 September 2017 of the plaintiff complaining that his ability to work had been substantially reduced even though he did complain generally of “lethargy and drowsiness” and had at his first consultation with A/Prof Yoong taken care to identify “walking, sleep and enjoyment of life” as specific “activities” that had been affected significantly by the pain. I think it is fair to say that it is not uncommon for people to leave their jobs within a year or two of starting for any number of reasons, hence if the plaintiff wishes to establish that he left DBS and CIMB because of his injuries from the accident I consider that it is incumbent on him to produce more evidence than he has done.

33     The upshot is that I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s injuries have necessitated the consumption of pain medication that has compromised his mental functions and thus his ability to work, but by a mild rather than serious or severe degree. I am also satisfied, on the basis of A/Prof Yoong’s statements that “the plan has always been, and will continue to be a reduction or stopping of these medications” and that as at March 2018 he has “managed to taper the oxycodone dose” (in his clarification dated 22 March 2018), that it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will take less medication in the future and consequently will have his mental acuity affected less than it was when he was working at DBS and CIMB.

34     On these findings the plaintiff’s submission of $100,000 for LEC strikes me as rather too high. The plaintiff referred to a number of precedents in which sums from $60,000 to $180,000 were awarded for LEC, namely _Chew Poh Kwan Margaret v Toh Hong Guan and another_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 280</span> ($60,000), _Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 178</span> ($100,000) and _Nirumalan V Kanapathi Pillay v Teo Eng Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 601</span> ($180,000), but I do not find these precedents useful given that they involved altogether different circumstances including different injuries and occupations. The plaintiff is at present 52 years old and so he might ordinarily be expected to work for another 15 years or so. Balancing on one hand the plaintiff’s mildly compromised mental function that is likely to improve over time, and on the other hand his relatively high income and the not insubstantial duration of his expected future working life, I assess damages for LEC at $25,000. This is about 2.5% of the plaintiff’s income of $12,000 per month for seven years which seems to me reasonable all things considered.

## Medical and transport expenses

### Incurred expenses

35     There is not much difference in parties’ positions in relation to the incurred medical expenses: the plaintiff submits $13,362.01 while the defendant submits $13,079.56. The difference of $282.45 consists of the cost of multiple consultations with a urologist between 27 July 2015 and 17 September 2015 and the cost of consultations with an eye specialist on 17 December 2014 and 17 October 2015. Although I accept the plaintiff’s evidence that he went for these consultations because of referrals from the doctors who were treating him for his injuries from the accident, to allow the plaintiff to recover the cost of the consultations I need to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that they concerned medical problems that were caused by the accident. I am unable to make such a finding in the absence of any explanation or elaboration in the medical reports. Hence I subtract the items disputed by the defendant and assess damages for incurred medical expenses at $13,079.56.

36     As for incurred transport expenses, the plaintiff claims $2,175 whereas the defendant submits $102.08. The defendant argues that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the cost of transport by taxi to and from his medical appointments only but the plaintiff is effectively seeking reimbursement of the cost of all the taxi rides he took between the date of the accident and 3 March 2015. These taxi rides include trips that the plaintiff took to and from his church, the supermarket and his office. He says that he had to take taxis instead of cheaper forms of public transport because of his injuries. While that is not an unreasonable explanation I agree with the defendant’s submission in principle because only the trips to and from the medical appointments can be considered truly necessary travel. It seems to me from the evidence that the total cost of those trips was $162.62 and not $102.08. In any event I prefer to round up and assess damages for incurred transport expenses at $200.

### Future expenses

37     In his medical report dated 8 August 2015 Dr Poon said that as a result of the injuries from the accident the plaintiff “would require regular medical reviews for the rest of his natural life” and the cost of these reviews “may be approximately SGD1000 per annum (for consultation and medication)”. It is not disputed that in addition to consultation and medication the plaintiff will need at regular intervals to incur expense to change the raised insole that he uses to correct his gait. Dr Low Boon Yong opined in a medical report dated 12 January 2018 that it was “reasonable that the cost of the insole could be about $200 a year”. The plaintiff submits that he will incur these medical expenses of $1,200 annually for 28 more years given his present age and the statistical average life expectancy of men in Singapore. Thus the plaintiff submits that he is entitled to future medical expenses in the sum of $33,600. He further submits that he will need to incur $150 a year for transport to and from his future medical appointments, which over 28 years comes up to an award of $4,200 for future transport expenses.

38     The defendant accepts a starting point of $1,000 per annum for consultation and medication but argues that this should decrease over time given A/Prof Yoong’s statement that the longer-term plan for the plaintiff is to reduce or even eliminate the pain medication that he is now taking. The defendant also contends that $200 a year for the insole is an overestimate. In cross-examination the plaintiff acknowledged that the change of insole is required once every two years and not every year, and there is documentary evidence that in 2015 and 2017 the cost of the new insoles was $197 and $322.50 respectively. The defendant submits that the cost of changing the insole is more accurately $130 a year. Taking into account the likely eventual reduction of the cost of consultation and medication, the defendant submits that the plaintiff’s total future medical expenses including the insole change and transport to and from his medical appointments should not exceed $1,000 a year.

39     The defendant has no serious quarrel with the proposition that the plaintiff has about 28 years left of expected lifespan. But I agree with the defendant’s submission that it is well-established that the multiplier for future losses is not simply the number of expected years remaining. Instead there must be a discount to take into account the vicissitudes of life and the benefit of receiving now a lump sum representing expense that has not in fact been incurred yet. The defendant submits a multiplier of 13 years and I consider that to be reasonable.

40     Moving to the multiplicand, as for the cost of the insole change it is clear that historically the average cost was about $130 a year but it seems likely that the cost is increasing over time. I am thus inclined to adopt the figure of $200 a year that Dr Low said was reasonable. As to the cost of consultation and medication, I agree with the defendant that this should decrease over time. Roughly speaking I think that the amount of reduction of expense in this regard should not be too far away from the cost of future transport to and from the plaintiff’s medical appointments, and so I take $1,000 a year as the cost of consultation and medication and transport. Thus the total multiplicand is $1,200. I multiply this by the multiplier of 13 years and round up and so assess damages for future medical and transport expenses at $16,000.

## Concluding summary

41     Total damages are assessed at $141,279.56, broken down in the following way:

> (a)     $56,000 as general damages for pain and suffering, comprising the following components –

>> (i)       $28,000 for the comminuted femur fracture,

>> (ii)       $24,000 for chronic pain and CRPS, and
