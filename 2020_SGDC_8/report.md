\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9165/2019/01.\]

14 January 2020

### 2 Principal District Judge Victor Yeo Khee Eng:

1       This judgment arose from an appeal against conviction. The accused, Mr Ariff Bin Abdul Rahman, claimed trial to a charge of consuming a specified drug, namely, morphine, without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The offence under section 8(b)(ii) and punishable under section 33A(2) of the MDA, is commonly referred to as a “LT-2” charge.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the accused guilty of the said offence. Subsequently, the accused pleaded guilty to another charge of possession of drug utensils under section 9 and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA (DAC 911285-2018). The accused consented to have another similar charge of possession of drug utensils (DAC 911284-2018) taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

3       The accused was sentenced to seven (7) years’ and three (3) months’ imprisonment and six (6) strokes of the cane for the LT2 charge. For the possession of drug utensils charge under section 9 MDA offence, I sentenced the accused to four (4) months’ imprisonment. I further ordered the sentences to run consecutively, making a global sentence of **seven (7) years’ and seven (7) months’ imprisonment and six (6) strokes of the cane**. The sentences were also order to commence with effect from 20 March 2018.

4       The accused being dissatisfied with the decision has filed an appeal against conviction only. He is currently serving the sentence.

5       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## THE TRIAL

#### The Proceeded Charge (DAC 911283-2018)

6       The charge against the accused read as follows:

> “You ... are charged that you, on or before 23 November 2016, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, **morphine**, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA,

> and further

> that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 30 July 2009 in District Court No. 5, vide DAC/41228/09, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, buprenorphine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and punished under section 33A(1) of the MDA with 5 years’ 6 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you are thereby liable to be punished under Section 33A(2) of the MDA

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

#### Arrest of the Accused

7       The facts of the case are largely not in dispute. The accused was arrested on 23 November 2016 at about 7.45 pm at Blk 476A Pasir Ris Drive 6, Singapore on suspicion of having committed drug-related offences.

8       On arrest, four syringes, two lighters and a spoon were seized from the accused. The accused admitted ownership and possession of these items, which formed the subject of the possession of drug utensils charge in DAC 911284-2018. According to the arresting officer, SSGT Cheok Cheong (PW3), in his experience as a CNB officer, such utensils were typically used as drug utensils.

#### Procurement of urine specimens and Analysis by HSA analysts

9       The accused was subsequently brought to Bedok Police Division HQ, where he provided his urine samples. The IUT result slip (exhibit P5) showed that the accused’s urine sample was tested positive for opiates and benzodiazepines.

10     The urine samples were subsequently sent to Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for analysis. Upon analysis by Scientific Officers Chang Hian Twan (PW1) and Bellene Chung (PW2), the urine samples were found to contain morphine. Morphine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

11     The relevant certificates prepared by the two HSA analysts under section 16 of the MDA were admitted in evidence (exhibits P1 and P2 respectively). The presence of morphine is consistent with the consumption of diamorphine and heroin. More significantly, medications such as Anarex, Diclofenac, Famotidine and Dhasedyl DM would not give rise to morphine in the urine. The significance of these medications would be dealt with below.

#### Presumption of consumption under section 22 MDA

12     Given that the accused’s urine specimen were found to be tested positive for morphine, by virtue of section 22 of the MDA, the accused is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed morphine in contravention of section 8(b) of the MDA.

13     Section 22 provides as follows:

> Presumption relating to urine test

> 22.    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), _he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug_ in contravention of section 8(b).

#### The Accused’s Statements (exhibits P6, P7 and P8)

14     In addition to the presumption under section 22 MDA, the prosecution also relied on the statements recorded from the accused. In this respect, during the course of the trial, the prosecution successfully applied for the statements recorded from the accused to be admitted as evidence.

#### Statement recorded by SGT Muhammad Sufyan Bin Mohamed Khairolzaman (PW6)

15     The first statement (exhibit P6), consisting of 3 pages and 10 paragraphs, was recorded from SGT Muhammad Sufyan Bin Mohamed Khairolzaman (‘SGT Sufyan’) on 24 November 2016 at about 2.53pm at the CNB Bedok Police Division HQ. The accused did not allege that the statement was recorded under any specific threat, inducement or promise. However, he alleged that the amendments to his statement were fabricated by the recorder, who forged his signature against the amended portions of the statements.

16     SGT Sufyan denied fabricating the accused’s statements and forging the accused’s signature. He explained that he recorded what the accused had told him. He further explained that in relation to one particular amendment at paragraph 8, the word “Anarax” was amended to “Benzodiazepines” when he realised the typographical error. The amendment was made in the presence of the accused but the accused refused to countersign against the amendment and SGT Sufyan recorded this in the statement.

17     I agreed with the prosecution that there was no reason for SGT Sufyan to fabricate the accused’s statement or forged his signature, and I was satisfied that SGT Sufyan had recorded what the accused had told him. At paragraph 7, the accused stated as follows:

> 7    Pertaining to my urine tested positive for Opiates, I admit the last time I inject ‘Panas’ (Panas is referred to as Heroin) was about 3 weeks ago. I put a small amount of ‘Panas’ on the spoon and mix it with water. I then use a lighter to heat it spoon. I then put ‘Panas’ into the syringe and I injected it into my left arm. I did not feel anything after injecting. I bought ‘Panas’ from ‘Botak’ for about $20 per straw at Geylang Lorong 12. I do not know him personally and I do not have his contact number. ‘Botak’ is a small and skinny guy. I usually inject ‘Panas’ once a month and I do not remember when was the last time I relapse. _I think I relapsed around early this year. I do not remember why I relapsed._

18     At paragraph 8, pertaining to his urine being tested positive for ‘Benzodiazepines’, the accused stated that he thought it was because he had consumed ‘Anarax’. He got the ‘Anarax’ from Tampines Polyclinic yesterday (23 November 2016) because of his fever. The accused denied taking any Erimin-5 tablets or Epam tablets.

19     When asked about the items seized from him, the accused stated at paragraph 9 that the items were meant for his own consumption. The syringes were used to inject ‘Panas’, and the lighters and spoon were used to heat ‘Panas’ before injecting. The razor blade was not meant for drug use but it was used to cut cigarettes.

20     Further, at paragraph 10 of his statement, the accused stated that he did not take any other controlled drugs beside ‘Panas. He regretted his actions. If he had known better, he would not have injected ‘Panas’.

#### The Ancillary Hearing for the Admissibility of Statements recorded by SI Yeung Yew Ming (PW8)

21     Station Inspector Yeung Yew Ming (‘SI Yeung’) recorded a further statement (exhibit P7) from the accused on 1 December 2016 at about 9.00pm at the Police Cantonment Complex, Lock-up Interview Room, followed by a cautioned statement (exhibit P8).

22     The accused challenged the admissibility of these two statements recorded on 1 December 2016 by SI Yeung. The accused alleged that the statements were given involuntarily as SI Yeung had deceived him by making a secret promise to the accused that he would recommend the accused to be sent to DRC if the accused gave a positive statement. The accused further alleged that parts of the statement were fabrications by SI Yeung.

23     SI Yeung gave evidence that he recorded a further statement from the accused to clarify the statement previously recorded by SGT Sufyan. Before the statement recording, SI Yeung interviewed the accused and showed him the HSA urine reports. The accused chose to speak in English and the previous statement was read back to the accused. The accused did not have any complaint regarding the previous statement. However, the accused wished to make some amendments to the previous statement.

24     After SI Yeung recorded the further statement, it was read back to the accused. The accused affirmed the statement to be true and correct. The accused appended his signature and wrote his full name and NRIC number below the further statement. The accused was invited to make any amendment, addition or deletion to the statement but he declined.

25     SI Yeung testified that the further statement was given by the accused voluntarily. There was no threat, inducement or promise made to the accused before or during the recording of the statement. In particular, SI Yeung maintained that he did not promise the accused that he would be recommended DRC if the accused gave a positive statement.

26     Thereafter, SI Yeung proceeded to serve the Charge and the Notice of Warning under section 23 of the CPC to the accused. The accused acknowledged this and after recording the cautioned statement, it was read back to the accused, who confirmed the statement. The accused did not wish to make any corrections and signed below the statement, and wrote his NRIC number.

27     SI Yeung testified that the statement was given voluntarily and he did not make any inducement, threat or promise to the accused either before or during the course of the recording of the cautioned statement.

#### The Accused’s Evidence for the Ancillary Hearing

28     The accused testified that SI Yeung realised that the previous statement recorded by SGT Sufyan was a blunder and hence recorded the further statement in order to repair the mistake. The accused also alleged that SI Yeung also took the opportunity to fabricate further allegations against him.

29     The accused gave evidence that SI Yeung promised him that he would speak to his superiors and recommend the accused to be sent to DRC if he admitted to the charge. They even shook hands as a promise of secrecy and the accused trusted SI Yeung and signed the statements, which SI Yeung fabricated. However, SI Yeung had misled and deceived him after recording his further statement.

30     At the end of the ancillary hearing, I was satisfied that the further statement and cautioned statement recorded by SI Yeung from the accused were given voluntarily by the accused without any threat, inducement or promise. I found the accused’s allegations to be vague and unbelievable. On the one hand, the accused claimed that he was promised DRC while being addicted to codeine. On the other hand, the accused claimed that SI Yeung fabricated the further statement to repair the blunder made by SGT Sufyan when recording the previous statement.

31     The accused was aware that he was facing an LT2 charge and clearly knew that he would not be eligible for DRC. As clarified by SI Yeung during his evidence, he did not have the authority to decide whether the accused could be sent to DRC and it is not the practice of CNB to promise accused persons’ admission to DRC when recording statements. In my view, there is no reason for SI Yeung to make a false promise of DRC to the accused, neither is there any reason for the accused to believe or rely on such a promise even if they were so made. Accordingly, I admitted the accused’s further statement and cautioned statement in evidence.

#### The Statements recorded by SI Yeung Yew Ming (Exhibits P7 & P8)

32     The further statement recorded by SI Yeung consisted of one page and six paragraphs (i.e. continuing at paragraphs 11 to 16). Therein, the accused confirmed his earlier statement recorded by SGT Sufyan and wished to make some amendments to his previous statement.

33     At paragraph 12 of the further statement, the accused admitted that the last occasion that he had consumed ‘Panas’ was one day prior to his arrest. At paragraph 13, the accused stated as follows:

> 13    On 22/11/2016 at about 4 plus in the afternoon, I smoked ‘Panas’ alone inside the toilet of Elias Mall alone by sing ‘chasing the dragon’ method. I poured some ‘Panas’ onto an aluminium foil and used a lighter to burn the underside of it. I then rolled up a rough paper to use it as a ‘barrel’ to suck the fumes from burning the ‘Panas’. I took about 7 to 8 puffs of it and the session lasted for about 10 minutes. After spoking ‘Panas’, I felt ‘high’. I relapsed to smoke ‘Panas’ since February 2016 this year and the reason is because I am stress with life as I got no place to stay.

34     From the further statement, the accused admitted that on the afternoon of 22 November 2016 at about 4 plus, he had smoked heroin inside the toilet of Elias Mall using ‘chasing the dragon’ method. The accused explained that due to stress, he had relapsed to consuming heroin since February 2016.

35     I further noted that the accused again maintained that other than ‘Panas’, he did not abuse any other controlled drugs. However, he admitted to consuming his niece’s cough syrup, namely Dhasedyl, and medications prescribed to him by a doctor from Tampines Polyclinic on 23 November 2016. In this regard, he took medications like Anarex, Diclofenac and Famotidine prescribed from Tampines Polyclinic for his backache and for pain relief. All these medications were taken before he had provided his urine sample.

36     In his cautioned statement (exhibit P8) when the charge was read to him, the accused stated that he had nothing to say.

## THE DEFENCE

#### The Accused’s Evidence

37     The accused elected to give evidence when he was called upon to enter his defence.

38     His defence is a relatively straightforward one. Essentially, the accused denied having consumed heroin. His defence was that he became a codeine addict in 2015, and that his urine sample was tested positive for morphine because of the consumption of codeine. He had purchased cough mixture which costs about $15 to $18 from Tampines and Pasir Ris Polyclinic, as well as from street peddlers. He was introduced to codeine tablets from a friend in early 2016 as it was cheaper and one tablet cost $2. By the time of his arrest, he could consume 5 or 6 tablets in a single shot.

39     The accused testified that whenever he had codeine withdrawal and his codeine tablets or cough mixture were running out, he would consume whatever medication and cough mixture within his reach and regardless of whose prescription it belonged.

40     In his evidence, the accused testified that on the date of his arrest, he had consumed codeine tablets together with his childhood friend Muhammad Nizam (‘Nizam’) at the staircase of Blk 476A, Pasir Ris. This was administered by crushing and dissolving the tablets in water and injecting the solution into his thighs. When they heard footsteps coming up the staircase, the accused quickly grabbed the utensils they were using and stuffed them into his pouch. Nizam left the scene but the accused was arrested and brought to the Bedok Police Division.

41     In respect of his statement recorded by SGT Sufyan, the accused gave evidence that he was suffering from codeine withdrawal at the time of the recording of the statement. The accused signed the statement so that he could be allowed to return to his cell and rest. He claimed that as a typical codeine addict, he would ignore what people said or do to them. He repeated his allegations that SGT Sufyan had fabricated the incriminating portion of the statements, and had forged his signature.

42     As for the further statement recorded by SI Yeung, the accused maintained that it was a false confession as SI Yeung had made a “promised of secrecy” to assure the accused that he would be released on bail and that he would recommend the accused to be sent to DRC.

43     The accused also called his friend Muhammad Nizam (‘Nizam’) as a defence witness to corroborate his testimony that he was a codeine addict and that on the date of his arrest, both of them had consume codeine tablets at Blk 476A Pasir Ris.

44     It transpired that both the accused and Nizam shared a cell during the period of their remand and Nizam had seen the accused bundle of documents for the trial.

#### Evidence of Muhammad Nizam Bin Mohamad Kassim (DW2)

45     Muhammad Nizam (‘Nizam’) gave evidence he knew the accused from his childhood days as they stayed in the same neighbourhood. Around January or February 2019, he met the accused in prison and learnt that the accused was charged with a drug consumption charge.

46     Nizam testified that he would meet up with the accused to take codeine tablets and cough mixture at Geylang about 2 to 3 times a week. They would crush the codeine tablets into powdery form, mix it with water and heat it with a spoon. After it became a liquid form, it would be siphoned into the syringe and administered through the veins.

47     Nizam further testified that on the material day in question when the accused was arrested, the accused called him that morning to say that he had some withdrawal symptoms. He asked Nizam if he had codeine tablets or cough mixture to spare him. As Nizam had spare codeine tablets, he asked the accused to meet him at Pasir Ris, Blk 476.

48     At the staircase, Nizam, who had brought along the utensils and the codeine tablets then prepared the codeine solution, and injected himself first and after that injected for the accused.

49     After that, they heard footsteps and he quickly left the scene with his codeine tablets but left behind the utensils used to administer the codeine tablets. He did not know that the accused was arrested and he came to learn that the accused was arrested only when he chanced upon the accused in remand. This was sometime in January or February 2019 and it was a chance meeting.

50     When questioned by the learned DPP whether he and the accused shared the same cell between 10 December 2018 and 15 March 2019, the witness claimed that he could not remember. He explained that it was when he read the accused’s bundle of documents and his statement that he remembered the exact details of the meeting, including the block number. He maintained that he did not discuss much about the case with the accused and offered to be the accused’s witness.

## FINDINGS

#### Presumption of consumption has not been rebutted

51     At the end of the trial, the main issue before the court was whether the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption under section 22 of the MDA that he consumed morphine in contravention of section 8(b) of the MDA. To do so, the accused must prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not have the _mens rea_ and/or commit the _actus reus_ of drug consumption.

52     Having carefully considered all the evidence, including the testimony of the accused, I found that the accused has failed to rebut the presumption under s 22 MDA that he had consumed morphine.

53     As rightly submitted by the prosecution, it is trite law that a vague and uncorroborated allegation that an accused person had consumed medication is insufficient. In absence of any other credible evidence, such commonly used defence should be approached with greater caution and circumspection.

54     In assessing the evidence of the prosecution and the defence, this court has had the benefit of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and their credibility.

55     With regards to the accused’s statement recorded by SGT Sufyan, I found that SGT Sufyan was a reliable and forthright witness and he has no reason to either fabricate the incriminating portions of the accused’s statement and to falsify his signature as alleged by the accused. SGT Sufyan did not know the accused prior to 23 November 2016. Other than the sealing of the accused’s urine specimen and recording this statement from the accused, he played no other role.

56     Moreover, SGT Sufyan testified that the accused had signed on the amendments except in paragraph 8 when the word “Anarax” was amended to “Benzodiazepines”. The amendment was made in the accused’s presence but the accused refused to countersign on the amendment at paragraph 8.

57     In my view, if the accused’s allegation that the officer had forged his signature were to be believed, then it would not make sense for the recording officer not to have also forged the signature in respect of the amendment as well. Instead, the officer made the effort to write down that the accused had refused to sign against the amendment.

#### The Accused had voluntarily confessed in his statement

58     I also could not accept the accused’s submission that the incriminating portions of this statement were fabricated by SGT Sufyan just because some parts accordingly to the accused were contradictory and did not make sense. In my view, it only served to reinforce my assessment that the recording officer did not fabricate the accused’s statement but had merely recorded what the accused had told him.

59     In the accused’s submission, he tried to explain that the reason why he did not challenge the incriminating portions of paragraphs 9 and 10 of his statement was that he is not a lawyer, and that he was unrepresented at the trial and due to ignorance, he did not challenge paragraphs 9 and 10.

60     Having had the benefit of observing the accused conduct his own defence, and how he had extensively cross-examined the witnesses, including the CNB officers, I did not accept his explanation that it was an innocent mistake on his part. In my view, if it were the defence case that SGT Sufyan had also fabricated paragraphs 9 and 10, the accused would surely have challenged those paragraphs as well.

61     The inference to be drawn from the accused’s failure to challenge these paragraphs is that they contained the truth, that is, the syringes, lighters and spoon were used for his consumption of ‘Panas’, and that he regretted his actions for taking ‘Panas’. In his attempt to dissociate himself from the incriminating portions of his statements, the accused has no qualms in making false allegations in court against SGT Sufyan.

62     Thus, I agreed with the prosecution that full weight should be given to the accused’s incriminating admissions in exhibit P6 that the accused had relapsed and consumed ‘Panas’.

63     As for the statement recorded by SI Yeung, I did not accept the accused’s allegation that the officer had practised deception on the accused and manipulated the accused into fabricating a false statement to incriminate himself.

64     I found that to be illogical and unbelievable. Quite clearly, as evident in the statement, some of the details contained in the statement could only have come from the accused himself. For example, SI Yeung would not have known that the accused smoked ‘Panas’ inside the toilet of Elias Mall at about 4 plus in the afternoon unless the accused volunteered this information to him.

65     I found it unbelievable that the accused would incriminate himself based on an unsubstantiated promise allegedly made by the recording officer. In short, I found SI Yeung to be a credible and reliable witness. In my view, there was no reason for both SI Yeung and SGT Sufyan to falsely implicate the accused.

66     As for the accused’s defence, I note that the accused had failed to raise the consumption of codeine as his defence in all his statements to the two recording officers during the course of the investigation. Neither did the accused mention the existence of his friend and material witness, Nizam.

67     Furthermore, when one examined the contents of the cautioned statement (exhibit P8), the accused stated that he had nothing to say.

68     In my view, this was fatal to the accused’s defence that he was a codeine addict and that he had consumed codeine together with Nizam at Blk 476A Pasir Ris on the date of his arrest. At no point in time during the investigations did he mention the existence of Nizam or his consumption of codeine defence in his statements to the officers. One would have reasonably expected the accused to reveal this in his defence to the IO.

69     Instead, I found it rather incredible that the accused, who was facing a very serious LT2 drug consumption charge, would choose not to mention this defence or a witness as material as Nizam, but would instead choose to falsely implicate himself in his statements.

70     In this respect, I agreed with the prosecution that Nizam was not a credible witness at all. He was evasive during the cross-examination and I found his evidence to be contradictory and unreliable. Nizam clearly had ample opportunity to collude with the accused to fabricate their versions of events on 23 November 2016 given that they occupied the same cell.

71     I found it incredible that Nizam was able to recall the events which took place more than 2 years ago with such clarity when he had no contact with the accused until they met in remand. Unlike the CNB officers who have no reason to falsely implicate the accused, Nizam who himself was facing a drug consumption charge, clearly has every reason to help his childhood friend.

72     In the final analysis, I concluded that the accused’s defence that he had consumed codeine was clearly an afterthought and could not be believed. In my view, this was clearly a desperate attempt on the part of the accused to deny the LT2 drug consumption charge.

#### Verdict

73     For the above reasons, I found that the accused has failed to rebut the presumption under section 22 of the MDA. I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted him of the charge.

## SENTENCE

74     The accused did not appeal against the sentence imposed on him. However, for completeness, I would provide the reasons for the sentence imposed.

76     Additionally, the accused was admitted into a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) on 6 March 1996 for a period of 6 months for an offence of consumption of a controlled drug. He was placed on drug supervision on 30 May 1997, 14 May 2001 and 25 June 2013 for drug consumption.

77     The prescribed punishment for the LT2 charge is a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The maximum punishment is 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

78     In respect of the possession of the drug utensils charge which the accused pleaded guilty to, the prescribed punishment is 3 years imprisonment or fine of $10,000 or both.

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

79     The prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 7 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment and the mandatory 6 strokes of the cane for the LT2 charge. The prosecution submitted that the accused was heavily traced for drug-related offences. He had also not pleaded guilty and instead elected to claim trial. As such, an uplift of at least 6 months’ from the mandatory minimum of 7 years’ imprisonment would be warranted.

80     As for the possession of drug utensils charge, the prosecution sought a sentence of at least 3 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution further submitted that the sentences should be ordered to run consecutively as they arose on different arrest and on different occasions.

81     Hence, the prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 7 years’ and 9 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

#### Mitigation plea

82     The accused had very little to offer for his mitigation. He maintained his innocence for the LT2 drug consumption charge. However, he admitted that he was in possession of the drug utensils charge and pleaded guilty to the said charge, and consented to have the remaining charge of possession of drug utensils taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

#### Sentencing considerations

83     In deciding on the sentence to impose, I noted that the accused’s last conviction for the LT1 drug consumption charge was in July 2009. On that occasion, the accused did not receive the mandatory minimum imprisonment sentence but was sentenced to 5 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the case.

84     While the 3 years’ imprisonment term for the enhanced possession charge was ordered to run concurrently with the LT1 charge, I noted that the accused also received a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for a theft conviction which sentence was ordered to run consequently with the LT1 offence. In other words, the global sentence was 5 years’ and 12 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

85     Suffice for me to note, for offences relating to the abuse of controlled drugs, the predominant sentencing objective must be one of deterrence, both general and specific. Having regard to the accused’s drug antecedents, the accused’s lack of remorse, and the unfounded allegations he made against the CNB officers during the trial, I agreed with the prosecution that an uplift from the mandatory minimum imprisonment would be appropriate to achieve the objective of a specific deterrence.

#### Sentence imposed

86     Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to 7 years’ and 3 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

87     For the possession of the drug utensils charge, I sentenced the accused to 4 months’ imprisonment. I also agreed with the prosecution that it would be appropriate to order that the sentences to run consecutively considering that they related to different arrests and on different occasions.

88     Thus, the total sentence imposed was 7 years’ and 7 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. I further ordered that the sentence be backdated to 20 March 2018, the date of his remand.

89     The accused being dissatisfied with the decision has appealed against his conviction.

90     At the time of writing the Grounds of Decision, the accused is serving sentence.
