### District Judge Loo Ngan Chor:

## Introduction:

1       These are the grounds of the decision which I make in this case, which is to dismiss both the claim and the counter-claim.

2       The plaintiff and the defendant are in the building construction trade. Specifically, their specialty is in “the plumbing and sanitary works industry.” [^1]

3       This dispute involves a claim by the plaintiff for damages for breach of contract by the defendant. The defendant denies any breach and counter-claims for an unpaid amount of work that it says it had done.

4       The unfortunate cause of the dispute is that the parties’ agreement was entirely oral. This has led to a difference of positions concerning, amongst others, what the defendant was to be paid, the claim and payment procedures and whether the defendant’s works included excavation.

5       The trial before me took place over several tranches, with the plaintiff calling four witnesses and the defendant calling three.[^2]

6       The plaintiff obtained a sub-contract for sanitary works for 114 units of houses under construction around 5th April 2013.[^3] It had been incorporated on 13th July 1999. The job site is described as being located at Jalan Ulu Seletar/Sembawang Road (Yishun planning area). According to the plaintiff’s account, “As the sanitary works required at the job site is rather extensive, the plaintiff had to sub-contract some of the works to third party contractors.”

7       The defendant was one such sub-contractor, whose Mr Subbiah Mugilarasan (“Mr Mugil”) (a director of the defendant) was contacted by the plaintiff’s Mr Ang Hwee Bin (“Mr Ang”) (a director of the plaintiff).[^4] (Mr Mugil identified someone called Mr Galvin Low of the plaintiff as the person with whom he agreed to do the works, but nothing turns on this.[^5]) The defendant was incorporated on 19th January 2012.

8       The defendant’s job was to construct underground sanitary piping works (“sanitary works”) for each of 19 units of housing under development, which included works for each unit that the plaintiff has described as the installation/laying of a manhole, inspection chambers, benching, pipes, chamber covers and channelling. In addition, for two show room units, the defendant was to supply labour to install plumbing/piping works for the first floors of the units.

## Issues in the first tranche:

9       At the outset, the trial was marked by several issues. Pleading-related issues continued to infect the trial even though some amendments were made after the first tranche. That was not all in that the parties’ headlong rush into the sanitary works without regard to the formalities remaining uncorrected was to come back to haunt the presentation of their respective positions at trial. To the issues of pleading, I now advert.

10     When I first saw parties during the first tranche of the trial, I heard their respective opening statements.[^6] The plaintiff claimed that the defendant breached the contract because the defendant failed to (a) carry out excavation works which, the plaintiff says, were “integral” to the underground work to be done by the defendant, (b) complete the work at the 19 units by 7th May 2014 and “renunciated the agreement” by abandoning works in January 2014. That was fair enough. But, as it then stood, the plaintiff’s initial claim for _damages_ totalled $249,495.75 which comprised the _sums it allegedly incurred_ owing to the alleged defendant’s lapses, as follows:

> 1)     The plaintiff’s having to deploy its own manpower at the 19 units so that it could not be deployed elsewhere resulting in “loss of income” of about $120,355.31 (including GST).

> 2)     A sum of $26,800.90 paid to MV Construction and Engineering Pte Ltd (“MVC”) for manpower supplied for the period between 10th February 2014 and 31st May 2014.

> 3)     A sum of $14,889.05 paid to JAI Construction Pte Ltd (“JAI”) for the period between March and May 2014.

> 4)     A sum of $14,053.38 paid to V-Tech Plumbing Services (“V-Tech”).

> 5)     Back-charges of $69,866.72 imposed by the plaintiff’s main contractor for excavation works between August 2013 and February 2014.

> 6)     Rectification of a choked pipe installed by the defendant, costing $3351.[^7]

11     In the course of the learned plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Alwyn Goh’s, submissions, I pointed out that the plaintiff’s claim appeared to have overlooked the _restitutio in integrum_ principle of damages whereby an innocent party could only recover the difference between his entire outlay occasioned by a breach and what might have been the outlay if the other party had carried out the contract properly.[^8]

Court:

 | 

In Latin we called it Restitutio ad (_sic_) integrum, you know?

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

Ah.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Which means to put the innocent party---

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

back into the position he would have been in if the contract had been satisfactorily completed.

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

In this particular instance, we should be looking at a loss of profits. Now, when you don’t have a price and the rate agreed in---in the contract with the Defendant, on what basis does a---you see, in the usual way, right---

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

the contract, if the Defendant have done properly, would have cost me $X.

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Now, because of his breaching the contract has cost me $9---no, sorry, $Y.

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Y being larger than X.

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Therefore, my damages are Y minus X.

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

How is this Y minus X?

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

I understand, Your Honour’s---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

This---

| 

Goh:

position.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

is just a number, you know?

 |
| 

Goh:

 | 

Mmm.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

It is just Y, you know. Your client is claiming $Y, you know. When he should be claiming Y minus X. But your client has a basic problem. He doesn’t have the number X.

 |

  
  

12     When the learned defendant’s counsel, Mr Selvaraj, delivered his opening, I was troubled enough by the orality of the evidence when useful objective documents might be expected to be available, to say so. Here follows the extract:[^9]

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

I’m not talking about that. I am talking about how---says that---this is the Plaintiff’s allegation, the Plaintiff say you didn’t do the work.

 |
| 

Selvaraj:

 | 

Then you have to look at the e-mails, Your Honour, it said---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Only the e-mails, is it?

 |
| 

Selvaraj:

 | 

e-mails, Sir.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Only the expedient evidence.

 |
| 

Selvaraj:

 | 

That’s the only thing, you see. If you were to look, the Defendant---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Is it within my province or how that it strike you to say how did the main---the main con, the actual main con certify the work?

 |
| 

Selvaraj:

 | 

That evidence has not been supplied by the Plaintiffs.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

I know that---you could have applied for a specific discovery of those documents. Should I be asking to look at those documents? I have got the power under Section 167, I think, to call for those documents.

 |
| 

Selvaraj:

 | 

Yes, Sir.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Then instead of quarrelling about this, about that, because this is \[inaudible\] here on the ground, the Plaintiff’s side or---or the---the Defendant’s side. You know, you don’t see the document very much---

 |
| 

Selvaraj:

 | 

Yah---yah---yah.

 |
| 

Selvaraj:

 | 

It’s very loose, Your Honour.

13     Neither party took up my offer (under s167 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97)) to order further discovery of progress claims of the plaintiff pursuant to the main contract or of the plaintiff’s main contractor’s payment certificates, which, with suitable redactions to keep private the plaintiff’s own rates, might have shown how much work had been completed at the units in question.

14     Following the plaintiff’s second amendment of its Statement of Claim, which I allowed in the interval before the second tranche, the plaintiff pleaded that the defendant was hired to do sanitary works on 19 units of housing and to supply labour for two showroom units “on the following express and/or implied terms”. No attempt was made to distinguish between any supposed express or implied terms, and no particulars was offered for why any term should be implied. It contains a new amendment which avers that “as regards payment due to the defendant, parties _agreed_ to the following: (a) for the excavation costs for each of the \[19 units\] to be pegged to the _market rate_, which was approximately $900; (b) [^10]for the costs for the works at each of the \[19 units\] to be pegged to the **_market rate_**, which was approximately $5400…” (italics added)

15     The amendment went on to speak to damages: “after taking into account the contract price and the payments that have been made to the defendant …, the plaintiff had suffered loss and/or damage amounting to $146,863.94...”

16     In the defendant’s Defence and Counter-claim (Amendment No. 1), which preceded the plaintiff’s said second amendment, the defendant admitted that its works were for the 19 housing units and the supply of labour to two showroom units.[^11] In answer to the plaintiff’s claim that it had to employ named contractors to complete the defendant’s erstwhile sanitary works for certain named housing units, the defendant went on to say that “The Defendant has completed the installation of inspection chamber covers and benching for plot nos. 373, 374, 378, 379, 380, 434, 435, 436 whilst another contractor worked on plots 375, 376, 377, 381, 384, 385 and 386” and that “The Defendant has completed the alleged installation works for of (sic) IC for plots 434, 435, 436 and 437 whilst another contractor worked on plots 384, 385 and 386.”[^12] In further and better particulars, the defendant stated the name of the other contractor to be “Qanta and that our client (_sic_) does not have the full name of the company.”[^13]

17     In response to the plaintiff’s said second amendment, the defendant made consequential amendments to its Defence and Counter-claim (Amendment No. 1). It denied (on one, a more generous, interpretation) that there was a market rate pegged to the amounts alleged by the plaintiff, when it stated that “Save that there was an agreement that the defendant was to issue progress claims upon the completion of each phase of the defendant’s successful completion of the work, paragraph’s 5(6) and (7) of the ASOC is denied and the plaintiff is put to strict proof thereof.”[^14]

18     In the next paragraph of its pleading, the defendant first denied the plaintiff’s averment [^15]that the plaintiff “had liberty” to reject progress claims which were incorrect as to the work done or the “price charged”, and went on to say in the same sentence that the denial applied “save that the parties had _agreed_ that the prices will be at the _prevailing market rate_…”[^16] (italics added)

19     The defendant’s counter-claim for works done amounts to $149,621.15.

20     In the plaintiff’s Reply and Defence to the Counter-claim (Amendment No. 1), the plaintiff says:[^17]

> “… Paragraph 9 of the D&CC is denied and the plaintiff repeats paragraph 5(6) of the SOC. The plaintiff also repeats paragraph 10 of the D&CC where the defendant had expressly admitted that parties had agreed that the prices will be at the prevailing market rate…”

21     In their respective closing submissions, Mr Goh and Mr Selvaraj have reminded me that parties are agreed that the “market rate” applies (implying that each side’s assertion was the market rate).

22     For his part, Mr Goh states:[^18]

> “Given that parties are in agreement that the price for the terms of engagement was based on the prevailing market rate, the plaintiff submits that the court only has to determine what the prevailing market rate is in assessing damages.”

This statement appears to have overlooked the plaintiff’s now-amended claim that parties agreed what the market rate was.

23     Mr Selvaraj states: [^19]

> “Your Honour we wish to state at the outset that there is no dispute that parties had agreed that the defendants would charge the plaintiff the market rate.”

24     As pleadings now stand, the plaintiff says that parties orally agreed to the market rate for works for each housing unit being $5400 for the underground sanitary works and $900 for the excavation works. On the other hand, the defendant says that parties only agreed that the defendant would be paid an unspecified market rate for the sanitary works and that the excavation was not part of the defendant’s works.

## Brief aspects of the trial:

25     MVC and JAI were not amongst the plaintiff’s witnesses.

26     The plaintiff called only one of its said sub-contractors to give evidence, namely Mr Lau Wee Juin, a project manager of V-Tech.[^20] Mr Lau says that V-Tech was sub-contracted by the plaintiff to work on 83 units in the kind of underground sanitary formworks and construction which parties’ dispute was about. He says that V-Tech charged the plaintiff $6300 for sanitary works on each unit, which worked out to $900 for excavation and $5400 for the balance of the works, which he “confirm\[ed\]” was “the _prevailing market rate_” (his emphasis) for each unit.[^21] Mr Lau also supported the plaintiff’s claim that excavation is a necessary antecedent to, and thus part of, the sanitary works.

27     In cross-examination, Mr Lau said that after he visited the job site, he gave the plaintiff a (written) quotation which the plaintiff approved, following which the plaintiff issued V-Tech a letter of award.[^22] Neither the quotation nor the letter of award was put in evidence.

28     Mr Ang’s AEIC says that the defendant was expected to charge according to the prevailing market rate. In certifying the defendant’s progress claims, the plaintiff would check that “prices” charged were “in accordance with (_sic_) _prevailing market rate_” (his emphasis). In regard to rate, and the defendant’s progress claim no. 1, Mr Ang says that “the unit price for the work required” claimed by the defendant for the five relevant units was “excessive and/or not at the prevailing market rate”. As for labour supplied by the defendant for the two showroom units, Mr Ang’s point, made in regard to the defendant’s progress claim no. 2, was that “the hourly rate of a skilled worker was adjusted to that of the prevailing market rate which was $11.50 instead of $12.50” as claimed by the defendant.[^23]

29     Owing to the fact that the parties had exchanged AEICs before they made their respective second amendments to the pleadings, it is important to note that Mr Ang’s AEIC did _not_ say that he and Mr Mugil agreed to the lately pleaded market rate. Mr Mugil’s AEIC did not even mention a market rate, let alone that parties agreed to apply an unspecified market rate.

30     The defendant denies that excavation was part of its sanitary works or that parties agreed on any completion date. It stopped work in April 2014 owing to the plaintiff’s failing to pay its “invoices”, by which it referred to its uncertified progress claims, to cut loss.[^24] The defendant maintained that its “invoices” were for work it had actually done, saying in its opening statement that “The invoices were issued each time a phase was completed and verified by the plaintiff’s engineers.” [^25]

31     The defendant did not explain what it meant by phases. Its 12 progress claims state that it had done installations of pipes, manholes and installation chambers for which it stated what the charges were by reference to those works, which I understand to be what the defendant meant by phases. The defendant claimed sums pegged to what it felt were the values of the so-called phases of work. On the other hand, the plaintiff’s concern appeared to be over what it would cost to complete all of the sanitary works for each housing unit. Even though the dispute included a disagreement about how much work the defendant had done in relation to its job overall of completing the sanitary works for each housing unit, the defendant did not guide me on how its so-called phases fitted together into the sanitary works for each housing unit. Mr Mugil could not say what these phased charges would have added up to for each housing unit (at \[72\] below).

## Factual matrix and some findings:

32     Both parties have referred to _ART_ v _ARS and anr_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 78</span>. With respect, this was a pain-staking decision by Quentin Loh J who had this to say at \[53\]:

> 53    I distil the following guiding principles on the proper approach for determining the existence of an oral agreement as set out in the cases cited above:

>> (a)    in ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement, the court will consider the relevant documentary evidence (such as written correspondence) and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time;

>> (b)    where possible, the court should look first at the relevant documentary evidence;

>> (c)    the availability of relevant documentary evidence reduces the need to rely solely on the credibility of witnesses in order to ascertain if an oral agreement exists;

>> (d)    oral testimony may be less reliable as it is based on the witness’ recollection and it may be affected by subsequent events (such as the dispute between the parties);

>> (e)    credible oral testimony may clarify the existing documentary evidence;

>> (f)    where the witness is not legally trained, the court should not place undue emphasis on the choice of words; and

>> (g)    if there is little or no documentary evidence, the court will nevertheless examine the precise factual matrix to ascertain if there is an oral agreement concluded between the parties.

33     I agree that _ARS_ is a somewhat useful decision for the case before me given the largely oral character of the dispute, eg, the excavation question.

34     Before I state my principal findings concerning this case, I shall first set out briefly the factual matrix within which the fiasco unfolded. Owing to the numerous issues raised, I find it convenient to also state my findings in respect of aspects of the factual matrix within this heading.

35     It was not disputed that the defendant commenced the sanitary works in August 2013. It appears that the defendant was able to do this without the need for it to do any excavation. Neither did excavation appear to cause any differences between parties.

36     The plaintiff says that it also sub-contracted plumbing and sanitary works to the defendant at another project at Kaki Bukit Road 3, which works overlapped in time those in question before me, an undisputed fact on which the plaintiff placed much reliance. It did this to show that the defendant knew of the need to make progress claims by reference to percentages of work completed relative to the sanitary works as a whole, to receive the plaintiff’s payment certificates and then to invoice the plaintiff based on the certificates.

37     The plaintiff’s complaint is that the defendant’s progress claims for the 19 units uniformly claimed 100% for work done, which is wrong because work is expected to progress in stages, hence progress claims. The defendant’s rebuttal is that it billed in phases, so that when a “phase” was completed, it was justified in claiming 100% completion. I note that progress claim nos. 7[^26] and 9[^27] include claims pegged to 80% (of the defendant’s so-called phases).

38     For the Kaki Bukit project, the defendant had provided a written quotation “on May 21, 2013”[^28] and the plaintiff had issued a letter of award dated 1st June 2013. According to this letter of award, there were plumbing and sanitary works at 66 and 72 units located in two “blocks”. The defendant’s work was priced on a unitary basis and gave a total of $276,000.

39     In this regard, since the defendant did make progress claims, 12 in all, of which the plaintiff certified three, the plaintiff’s many references to the Kaki Bukit project which was subjected to a written contract unlike here, are over-done and of questionable utility.

40     In my humble opinion, the allegedly errant progress claims were more likely an example of the pitfalls of not having a written contract for works that in their nature are constituted by numerous parts and take time. Absent a written contract detailing the sanitary works and its components, I could understand why the defendant claimed by so-called phases. Without such a written point of reference, I do not see how the defendant could have meaningfully issued progress claims based on a phase of the work being a percentage of the total underground sanitary works for a unit.

41     The defendant issued 12 progress claims serially numbered as follows: on 1) 19th September 2013 for $24,292.75, 2)\* 8th October 2013 for $4251.50, 3) 10th October 2013 for $4631.75, 4)\* 5th November 2013 for $7042.50, 5) 8th November 2013 for $30,395, 6) 27th November 2013 for $40,288.25, 7) 10th January 2014 for $62,307.40, 8)\* 4th January 2014 for $2114.40, 9) 15th February 2014 for $19,115.25, 10)\* 15th February 2014 (again) for $588, 11)\* 8th March 2014 for $1169 and 12)\* 8th April 2014 for $168.[^29]

42     As correctly pointed out by the plaintiff, progress claim nos. 2, 4, 8, 10-12 were for supply of labour to the showroom units (asterisked in the foregoing paragraph). I note that progress claim nos. 10-12 were for supply of labour from January through March 2014. Although these claims were supported by periodic time sheets naming the worker(s), and the plaintiff’s supervisor (“Mani”), there is no indorsement by anyone from the plaintiff. As has been noted, the plaintiff says that the defendant pulled out in January 2014, with the defendant’s Mr Mugil admitting this in cross-examination[^30], the defendant’s stand is that it pulled out completely in April 2014.

43     In my view, both last-mentioned statements of the parties are true in that the plaintiff was referring to sanitary works at the 19 units from which the defendant withdrew in January 2014 whereas the defendant was referring to when he stopped supplying even labour at the two showroom units in April 2014, as Mr Mugil stated in re-examination.[^31]

44     It is to be noted that in the defendant’s AEICs, it did not again mention its pleaded allegation (at \[16\] above) that another contractor undertook some of its works. Neither was it belaboured by the plaintiff. So nothing turns on this.

45     The plaintiff certified progress claim no. 1 on 23rd October 2013 in the amount of $12,000. After deducting $1200 as a 10% retention, and deducting zero previous certification, and nothing for GST as the defendant was presumably not GST-registered, this left an amount of $10,800.[^32] The defendant rendered its invoice on 24th October 2013 for $10,800,[^33] which sum the plaintiff paid. In the text of the invoice, the defendant stated “Partial Bill Claim No. 01…”

46     The plaintiff certified progress claim no. 2 on 28th October 2013 (calling it claim no. 1) in the amount of $4053.50. Deducting nothing for retention or GST, the amount payable to the defendant was $4053.50.[^34] On 31st October 2013, the defendant rendered its invoice for $4053.50,[^35] which sum the plaintiff paid.

47     The plaintiff’s next, the third and last certification during the time of the defendant’s involvement was on 15th November 2013 for progress claim no. 5 (calling it claim no. 3). It certified $47,027.65, deducted 10% retention of $4702.77 and a “previous certified amount” of $14,968.58 (_queare_, _sic_, $10,800 + $4053.50 = $14,853.50), leaving an amount payable of $27,356.31.[^36] On 3rd December 2013, the defendant invoiced the amount of $27,356.31 as a “partial bill claim no. 3”.[^37]

48     The defendant made a point, in supposed explication of its claim for balances unpaid on the three certified progress claims, that its invoices stating “partial bill claim” showed that it saw that the plaintiff’s certifications as being incomplete relative to the defendant’s progress claims. In my view, this was neither here nor there based on the parties’ cases, because the plaintiff certified what it viewed to be what was due and, if the defendant wished now to be paid the balance, it has to prove that its works were more than what was certified.

49     I should add in connection with the fact that the plaintiff’s not having certified the other nine progress claims, including claim nos. 3 and 4 which preceded the plaintiff’s third certification, was not because the plaintiff did not receive the progress claims. The plaintiff’s case was that these claims did not reflect either the amount of work in fact done or reasonable prices.

50     Mr Selvaraj makes the point that given that progress claim no. 5 was paid in full, “… the rates claimed by the defendant in each of the progress claims were the market rate as agreed by the parties.”[^38] This was an extrapolation. Having gone through the progress claims and the three certifications, I am not able to say that the progress claims for the 19 units, other than progress claim no. 5, relate to the same items of work as in progress claim no. 5. The text descriptions across the progress claims, ie what the defendant has called phases of work and the rates, would not strike the uninitiated as referring to identical types of work. This (further and) important, point was not put to the plaintiff’s witnesses. With respect, I do not agree.

51     On the other hand, in my view, the plaintiff’s third certification (at \[47\] above) was a tacit rejection of progress claim no. 3 which purported to be for work done on the 19 units and progress claim no. 4 for labour supply for the showroom units (at \[41\]-\[42\] above). My view takes into account what I say in the next paragraph.

52     The defendant referred to Mr Mugil’s SMS chasers to make two points. Since the plaintiff still failed to pay the defendant in spite of his SMSes, it was “then decided to stop all work”. Also, the defendant says that the plaintiff’s replies “at no time intimated to the defendant that its progress claims were disputed.”[^39] In particular, I do note an SMS on 30th December 2013 at 1307 hours says: Hi Sir, we didn’t receive the last month – spring side certificate and some day work claim ie) manpower claim 03&04, pls can you arrange for me to issue the certificate ASAP. Tks – Mugil” A supposed reply, which is curiously undated, says “Ok will settle to u sori for the delay”. [^40] Even if the last was a reply intended for the defendant’s chaser of 30th December 2013, the informality of this communication has to defer to the effect of the plaintiff’s payment certificate no. 3 (for the defendant’s progress claim no. 5) and the plaintiff’s not having certified any further payments.

53     The defendant stopped further sanitary works in January 2014. It is unnecessary for me to make a finding on the alleged breaches of the completion date for either the excavation or the sanitary works because the plaintiff makes no claim for any consequence arising out of either date.

54     I now refer to a number of documents of each party that came into existence past April 2014 when the defendant finally ceased any kind of involvement at the job site.

55     When on 4th June 2014 at 7.32am the plaintiff replied to a supposed progress claim summary emailed by the defendant a day before, stating “Should you wish to claim for the work done, please give us a justificable (_sic_) figure for each individual unit. Otherwise we continue to dispute the amount.”[^41] , the defendant replied with a 3-page revised “progress claim summary” dated 6th June 2014[^42] . In the accompanying email, at 1722 hours, the defendant stated: “**As per your previous email, we had attached the final-revised amount of our progress claim. Kindly verify and certify the amount and revert to us, ASAP.** FYI: We had verified the Work done through Mr Mani\_Site engineer\_Markpoint, and submitted the Supporting Documents…”[^43] (emphasis in original) The defendant maintained its numbers concerning the showroom labour costs[^44] but reduced/varied its claim concerning sanitary works at the 19 designated units, variously claiming 100% (six units), 95% (two units), 70% (four units) and 35% (seven units). _Per contra_, see \[37\] above.

56     On 20th June 2014 at 7.47pm, the defendant emailed Mr Mani, and asked that he “Kindly do your attestation and revert back to confirm the work done Progress @ spring side.”, to which there was no reply. To this email was attached a further progress claim summary dated 20th June 2014[^45] (which was expressly to be “verified by” Mr Mani) and a handwritten document for 12 units, bearing ticks, crosses and dashes (said to be done by Mr Mani to respectively indicate “completed”, “not complete” and “not available”)[^46] . There appears to be a signature and Mr Mani’s name placed with it, said to be a signature of Mr Mani’s.

57     In regard to the reference to “Mr Mani”, it is not disputed that he was the plaintiff’s site engineer. However, Mr Mani did not testify at the trial. The plaintiff claims that his duties did not include such verification work.

58     In my view, the purported verification by Mr Mani is unreliable. It is hearsay and it is not argued that any exception to the rule against hearsay applies. The defendant’s resort to this step appears unsolicited and was calculated to obtain support for its uncertified progress claims. It departed from the steps that had taken place in respect of the defendant’s 12 progress claims, the plaintiff’s three certifications and the defendant’s subsequent corresponding invoices.

59     On 30th October 2015, the plaintiff purported to issue payment certificate no. 4 by which it certified the defendant’s work as being $48,600, which after deducting 10% retention, and the previous certified sum of $47,324.99, resulted in a nett amount payable of $1415.11.[^47] In item D, for “Backcharges/Deduction Amount”, “Nil” was stated. This certificate was accompanied by a two-page document on the plaintiff’s letterhead, with the subject description “Underground Pipework Installation” and a purported date of valuation stated as 30th October 2015.[^48] In this valuation, the plaintiff stated for the first time that the rate applicable for each unit was $5400. It stated variously that the defendant completed 85% of work for 12 of the units and 55% for 4 of the units. In respect of eight units, it was remarked that work was “Done by MP”.

60     The plaintiff’s payment certificate no. 4, late as it was, appears coloured by the parties’ dispute which was well underway. It is an unsafe document to rely on for the purpose of determining how much of the sanitary works the defendant had in fact done.

61     The defendant instructed its lawyer to issue a letter of demand for $150,114.90 for work done, to which the plaintiff’s solicitors’ reply of 15th September 2016 rejected the defendant’s claim and counter-claimed $69,866.72 for excavation and $3531 for defective work. It was on 23rd December 2016 that the plaintiff issued a writ claiming these two sums and on 3rd March 2017 that the plaintiff amended its claim to include the sums outlined at \[10(1)-(4)\] above. I agree with the defendant that these are valid reasons to doubt the probity of these later claims, which I have factored into my findings below.

## Principal findings:

62     As mentioned above, the parties now say they _orally agreed_ that the defendant would charge the plaintiff “market rates”, with the plaintiff going further to say that these market rates were agreed at $5400 for the sanitary works and $900 for excavation. Each has pitched its case on the basis that I have to determine the market rate. Since, in my view, this is not all that I need to decide _apropos_ the market rate issue, I must first say that this mutually alleged oral agreement appears to me very much to be an afterthought on the part of both parties. That they agreed to apply a market rate was not their pleaded cases until their respective second amendments to their pleadings.[^49] As the parties’ AEICs preceded these second amendments, none of these AEICs says that there was such an agreement. Mr Ang’s and V-Tech’s AEICs referred only to a supposed prevailing market rate and Mr Mugil’s AEIC did not mention market rate at all.

63     I think that the true nature of the parties’ dispute involved contractual _quantum meruit_. See the exposition by the Court of Appeal in _Eng Chiet Shoong and ors_ v _Cheong Soh Chin and ors and anr appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 728</span> at \[27\] to \[41\]. At \[39\] to \[40\], the court said:

> 39    There are, admittedly, also other definitions which appear to be neutral (see, for example, Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases (Daniel Greenberg ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2012) at p 2414 (“Quantum meruit is the reasonable amount to be paid for services rendered or work done, when the price therefore is not fixed by contract …”)). These definitions do not – at least on a literal reading – preclude premising an obligation on the defendant to pay the plaintiff on the basis of an implied contract. However, in another work, the same editor appears to treat the concept of quantum meruit as focusing more on restitution or unjust enrichment instead (see Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law (Daniel Greenberg gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2010) vol 2 at p 1857; see also the preceding paragraph):

>> **Quantum meruit**. … In its early history the action for quantum meruit was, no doubt, a genuine action in contract, based on a real promise to pay, although the promise had not been expressed in words and the amount of the payment had not been agreed. Subsequent developments have, however, considerably widened the scope of this form of action, and the action now-seems to be founded on a desire to address unjust enrichment. …

> 40    There are **_yet other_** definitions which are _wholly consistent with the distinction_ between contractual _quantum meruit_ and restitutionary _quantum meruit_. The following definition in _Words and Phrases Legally Defined_ (David Hay gen ed) (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2007) vol 2 at p 717 is an example:

>> **QUANTUM MERUIT**

>> The terms ‘quantum meruit’ or ‘quantum valebat’ are used in three distinct senses at common law, namely as denoting: (1) a claim by one party to a contract, for example on breach of the contract by the other party, for reasonable remuneration for what he has done; (2) a mode of redress on a new contract which has replaced a previous one; (3) a reasonable price of remuneration which will be implied in a contract where no price or remuneration has been fixed for goods sold or work done.

> Of these three types of claim, the second and third are clearly contractual, whereas the first is not based on contract …

Reference may also be made, in this regard, to _The Oxford Companion to Law_ at p 1022 (“Another possible measure of restitution in case of unjust enrichment …, or measure of payment where a contract has not fixed a price.”) as well as _A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage_ at p 724 (above at \[38\]).

64     The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary (1993) defines “market-rate” as “the current value of a commodity or service” (and, for the purpose of comparison), “market-price” as “the current price which a commodity or service fetches in the market”.

65     Interestingly, a claim for market value has been defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary as being a _quantum meruit_ claim as set out at \[38\] of _Eng Chiet Shoong_, where at item 4, the dictionary reads: **4.** A claim for the market value of a party’s performance under an implied-in-fact contract or an express contract that does not specify a price.

66     These definitions at \[64\] suggest that the “market” hyphenate has one specific quantity. This is what parties are asking me to do, that is to pick either of their asserted rates as being the correct one. See further \[92\] below. This would thus be unlike a _quantum meruit_ claim in which one usually tries to see if a disputed claim is _reasonable_ or not, and if not, what a reasonable sum might be. If parties had engaged on the basis of _quantum meruit_, it would no doubt have focused minds that we might here be dealing with a range of values and a large part of my reasons would become unnecessary. It is unfortunate that even though I mentioned _quantum meruit_ during the first tranche, in the course of Mr Selvaraj’s opening statement, counsel chose a different course with their clients’ second amendments.[^50]

67     Having said that, I am afraid that I am not able to determine what the market rate was for the works agreed on between the parties, or rather whether either of the parties’ rates was the market rate. What I have is two (sets of) numbers, each one claimed by the party whose interest is served to be the (right) market rate, with nothing to choose between them.

68     This is an issue of fact that cannot be resolved by individual witnesses of fact coming to court to say what he would charge. Neither swallow makes a summer. The issue can only be resolved by a market survey and a disinterested individual who knows the market coming to court to explain what the sanitary works and labour charges might reasonably have cost. No expert evidence was placed before me.

69     In other words, neither party has discharged its burden of proof that its rate is the market rate to apply.

70     Indeed, I doubt that there was any agreement to pay a market rate. See \[62\] above. The fact that the law treats a claim for the market value of services as one in _quantum meruit_ (at \[65\] above) implicitly recognises the experiential improbability of parties agreeing to an undefined market rate (as the defendant now says) as opposed to their not even discussing the price at all. If parties had agreed that the market rate would apply, it was a short step to parties just agreeing what the price for the sanitary works per unit of housing would be. Neither the rush to get started on the works nor the several months that went by, especially with the defendant submitting progress claims which the plaintiff did not certify, should have kept parties from putting on record that the market rate would apply and indeed what they might agree to be the market rate.

71     With specific reference to the plaintiff’s case, it says that it suffered the alleged damages by reference to what it paid out less what it claims to be the _contractual price_. The plaintiff goes further now to say that $5400 and $900 were - not just the market rate - but were the contractual prices. It is a matter of common sense that, on the facts, what the plaintiff paid V-Tech cannot be telescoped into the parties’ agreement so that V-Tech’s alleged rates became the contractual rate of the parties.

72     The defendant, for its part, now maintains that what it charged the plaintiff were the market rates. I use this plural form because the defendant, having charged in “phases” has not assigned a dollar value to what it might have cost the plaintiff for it to complete sanitary works for each housing unit. I found this incredible because men of commerce are expected to know the bottom line. The following extract from Mr Mugil’s cross-examination shows that he could not say what the constituent parts the defendant charged would add up to, and indeed, what his market rates for the sanitary works might be (based on each housing unit):[^51]

> Q    1AB1. Page 1.

> A    Yes.

> Q    Now, do you see the column that says “Rate per plot”?

> A    Yes.

> Q    So now, Mr. Mugil, is 9,350 the prevailing market rate that you’re referring to in paragraph 10?

> A    This is the reduced rate that---

> Q    Okay.

> A    I had given on this date.

> Q    I understand. So, Mr. Mugil, the answer is no?

> A    Yes, it’s not the market rate---

> Q    Okay.

> A    it’s reduced.

> Q    So, 8,500 and 11,400 per plot, is also not the prevailing market rate. Mr. Mugil, yes or no?

> A    No.

> Q    Thank you, Mr. Mugil. Now, Mr. Mugil, if this is the reduced market rate, can you show me a document in your own AEIC that shows the prevailing market rate for the plots? Or let me put it another way. Is there a document that can show this Court to show the prevailing market rate per plot?

> A    Every company quotes a different price.

> Q    That’s exactly what I’m asking, Mr. Mugil. Is there a document that you can find in your AEIC that shows the prevailing market rate? Yes or no, Mr. Mugil?

> A    No.

73     As I am not able to say that either of the parties’ rate was the market rate, the claim and the counter-claim stand dismissed.

74     For completeness, and in case I am wrong above, I make the following further findings.

75     The plaintiff says that the defendant breached the contract in that the defendant was not entitled to withdraw from the works because the plaintiff did not make any payment on what it considered to be the defendant’s inaccurate progress claim nos. 6 to 12. I do agree that the defendant was in breach of contract in stopping work when it failed to receive any certification for the seven progress claims. At \[50\] of _Goh Eng Lee Andy_ v _Goh Jin Kow_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 292</span>, the court said this:

> Moreover, the defendant had no general right in law to suspend work even if payment was wrongfully withheld unless the parties had expressly conferred such a right on the defendant or it could be established that the delay in payment made it not possible for the defendant to continue with the contract works (see Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 288</span> at \[55\]–\[57\] and \[65\]). The defendant failed to come within either of these exceptions…

76     That said, however, I am unable to believe that the plaintiff suffered the damages that it now claims.

77     The plaintiff’s case started life as a claim purely for outlay, ie, without reference to the restitutio principle.[^52] It originally claimed $69,866.72 “for engaging and/or undertaking the necessary excavation works from 1 August 2013 to 28 February 2014” and $3531 to rectify “defective pipe works”. Following a first amendment, it claimed that its outlay was $249,495.75, which included payments for excavation and to other contractors to complete the work that might have been done by the defendant.

78     Between January 2014 when the defendant withdrew from the sanitary works and 15th September 2016 when it responded to the defendant’s lawyer’s letter of demand (at \[61\] above), the plaintiff had a lot of time within which to establish what its damages were, if any. Yet, its first position was that it incurred expenses for two items, ie, excavation and repair of a pipe, and this remained its case when it filed its writ. I doubt that the plaintiff did incur the outlay that it claims.

79     Even for excavation works, the plaintiff’s case falls short because its evidence is that in order to do any underground works, the ground must first be excavated. Hence, the defendant must have been the one to do such excavation. In my opinion, I do not think that this inference arises from the premise. The fact that the ground has to be excavated does not necessarily mean that the defendant, charged with the underground sanitary works, had to be the one excavating. The fact that V-Tech contracted to excavate was a matter of its contract with the plaintiff. None of the documents relating to the other contractors, which the plaintiff produced, mentioned that these others had to do any excavation work. As noted at \[35\] above, the defendant could move right into the sanitary works in August 2013 without first doing any excavation or inviting criticism from the plaintiff.

80     The plaintiff’s evidence that the defendant was responsible for excavation works was not _distinctly_ there was an express oral agreement to that effect. In his AEIC, Mr Ang stated that parties agreed that the defendant “was required to carry out _underground_ sanitary formworks and construction … I should add that the defendant knew and or ought to have known that excavation works would be required as it is a project involving underground works…”[^53] I note that this statement does not in fact say that Mr Ang and Mr Mugil agreed that the defendant was tasked to excavate before underground works could start. In the following extract from his cross-examination, Mr Ang seems to have gone further in suggesting that when he pointed out to Mr Mugil at the job site the area where the defendant was to work, it included where the defendant had to excavate.[^54]

> Q    Okay. Now, when you say, “I asked him to do 19 designated units at $900 by excavation works.” How did you express it to him?

> A    Well I told him, I did not ask him to provide, but I brought him to the worksite to show him the condition of the worksite and explain to him where his work will cover, from where to where. And that would include places which they had to excavate, they had to do that. And they---and they must provide such things---they must provide such things to carry out their work.

81     I do not accept this allegation made in cross-examination

82     In respect of the excavation back-charges incurred, Mr Ang’s AEIC stated that “because the defendant did not excavate the grounds and time was of the essence in this entire project, the plaintiff had no choice but to urgently ask the plaintiff’s main contractor to help with the excavation works for the period between August 2013 and February 2014.”[^55] No credible document concerning the back-charges was placed before me (see \[89(1) below\]. Mr Ang’s evidence in court was that the main contractor excavated three units before the defendant started work, and that some excavation work was done by an electrical contractor and by the plaintiff itself or others.[^56]

83     On the other hand, Mr Mugil says that the first time he heard that the plaintiff had a claim related to excavation which “was never part of the scope of works” was on 15th September 2016 when the plaintiff’s lawyers responded to the defendant’s lawyer’s letter of demand.[^57]

84     The alleged excavation costs were couched in terms of back-charges in Mr Ang’s AEIC. (see \[82\] above). In payment certificate no. 4 (see \[59\] above), it was stated that there were no back charges. In the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2), the relevant sum was referred to as “the plaintiff’s out-of-pocket expenses”.[^58] Such documented inconsistencies lend no credence to the excavation claim.

85     In short, I find that excavation was not part of the defendant’s scope of works. More likely than not, Mr Ang did not broach it at all.

86     The plaintiff also alleges that it deployed manpower to 12 named units and seven named units, respectively comprising one supervisor and two skilled workers and one supervisor and three to five skilled workers between the respective periods of January 2014 to April 2014 and February 2014 to April 2014. In addition, it claimed that there was yet another supervisor deployed to supervise the said two groups of workers between January and April 2014. No explanation was given as to the work that these workers were supposedly engaged in. For these workers, the plaintiff claimed “loss of income” because they could not be deployed elsewhere.[^59]

87     Notwithstanding this alleged deployment of its own workers, the plaintiff seemed to suggest that even then the work remained incomplete because it had to bring in the other sub-contractors: MVC, JAI and V-Tech.[^60]

88     Mr Ang’s AEIC adduces documents purportedly supporting the plaintiff’s claim for damages. I accept Mr Goh’s submission that I should treat the MVC and JAI documents as admissible even though technically they are hearsay evidence, owing to the business records exception to the hearsay rule. See _Columbia Asia Healthcare Sdn Bhd and anr_ v _Hong Hin Kit Edward and anr_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 735</span> at \[19\] to \[26\].

89     In sum, having examined these documents, I find that they do not or do not credibly support the plaintiff’s alleged outlay.

> 1)     Starting with excavation back-charges, the text of the AEIC mentioned the sum of $69,866.72 as having “been back-charged by the successful tenderer … for urgent excavation works”.[^61] The exhibited half page document does not enable one to conclude anything about its veracity or source and states $68,596.[^62]

> 2)     Only a single-page table was exhibited to purportedly show the plaintiff’s manpower deployment. No further supporting source documents was produced.[^63] I note that the plaintiff used an hourly rate of $18 for a skilled worker. For comparison, MVC’s hourly rate (it being unstated whether the workers were skilled or unskilled) was $9 and the defendant’s hourly rate for a skilled worker/foreman was $12.50.[^64] Mr Ang himself stated that the hourly rate for a skilled worker was $11.50 (at \[28\] above).

> 3)     The MVC-related documents, comprising invoices and tables, and the plaintiff’s payment vouchers (which included payments for works at other job sites) do not say anything about what work was done.[^65]

> 4)     The JAI-related documents include two progress claim summaries dated 15th April and 15th May 2014, that refer to several works at housing units that were comprised in the defendant’s works.[^66] They appear to be JAI’s claims for $13,589 and $25,680, and they bear handwritten notations such as “less $3000/- (ecavator (_sic_) money)” on the former, and “2500”, “800”, “80%” and “$15,048.00”. There are several other documents comprising the plaintiff’s payment certificates and JAI’s invoices for April, May and June. These other documents have no apparent connection to the progress claim summaries.[^67] The numbers do not add up to those at \[10(3)\] above.

90     I now state the reasons why I am also unable to make a finding that the defendant in fact did the works it claimed in the progress claim nos. 3, 4, 6-12 which the plaintiff did not certify, even though I do not find it safe (at \[59\] and \[60\]) to rely on the belated plaintiff’s certificate no. 4 certifying a further sum of $1415.11.

91     There is a distinct possibility that the defendant did more works than what the plaintiff certified since the plaintiff’s payment certificate no. 4 was likely self-serving and yet conceded a (paltry) sum in the defendant’s favour. On the other hand, I do accept the plaintiff’s evidence that it did not certify the defendant’s works after certificate no. 3 because the defendant’s claimed works and rates were exaggerated. As to what works the defendant actually did, the defendant bears the burden of proof. The defendant’s unsolicited progress claim summaries, amended several times, and its approaching the plaintiff’s Mr Mani, as outlined at \[55\] to \[58\] above, constitute admissions by the defendant that its progress claims over-stated the amount of works that it completed. No issue of privilege was raised before me. The uncertified progress claims, and indeed the subsequent progress claim summaries, remain very much only the defendant’s unverifiable assertions as to how much work was done, leave alone that I am not able to find that the defendant’s charges applied the market rate.

92     That leads me to my final point. Mr Goh argues that the defendant’s prayers for relief are the principal one for “the sum of $149,621.15” and its ancillary prayer “for such further and other relief as the Honourable Court deems fit”.[^68] The defendant omitted to pray “for such sum as the court deems fit” or some such ilk and this omission is fatal to the counter-claim if I were to believe that some other amount should apply. See _Edmund Tie and Co (SEA) Pte Ltd_ v _Savills Residential Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 349</span> at \[9\], \[12\] and \[13\]. This issue does not arise at all because the defendant has run its case on the basis that the amount it has counter-claimed is the correct amount with no alternatives on the table.

## Decision:

93     For these reasons, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant’s counter-claim.

94     I propose to fix the costs of the claim and counter-claim, if necessary, after I have counsel’s written submissions on costs. These submissions should not exceed two typed pages and be submitted in the usual way within 14 days from the date of this decision.
