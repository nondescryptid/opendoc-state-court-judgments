Criminal Law – Criminal force and assault

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Appeals

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9108/2022/01.\]

11 August 2022

### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

1       The Accused claimed trial to the following charge under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”):

> You… are charged that you, on 14 December 2018, at or after 1.00 a.m., in a bedroom on the second floor of a chalet (Unit 20N) located at No. 10 Changi Coast Walk National Service Resort & Country Club, Singapore, did use criminal force on \[the victim\], _to wit_, by kissing her mouth and grabbing and squeezing her left breast with your hand, both over and under her clothes, intending to outrage her modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him.

3       Having heard the Prosecution’s address on sentence as well as the Accused’s mitigation, I imposed a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment.

4       The Accused has appealed against both the conviction and sentence, and is currently out on bail pending appeal.

## Background Facts

5       At the material time in December 2018, the Accused, the victim, PW1, PW4, DW2 and DW3 were colleagues working at a company in Singapore[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) (“the company”). On 13 December 2018, all of them attended a Christmas party at No. 10 Changi Coast Walk National Service Resort & Country Club (“the chalet”). The party started in the evening of 13 December 2018, and lasted until close to midnight the following day. Even after the party had concluded, many of the attendees stayed on to drink and chat, and some of them stayed overnight at the chalet.

6       The victim, PW1 and PW4 were among those who stayed overnight.

7       There were two bedrooms and a toilet on the second floor of the chalet. A sketch plan of the second floor of the chalet was admitted in evidence and marked P1.

## Issue in Dispute

8       The victim claimed that sometime in the early hours of 14 December 2018, while she was lying on a bed in one of the bedrooms of the chalet, she was forcefully kissed by the Accused, and he had also grabbed and squeezed her left breast, both over and under her clothes.

9       The Accused denied this, claiming instead that at the material time, he had merely laid down on the same bed as the victim as he was not feeling well and needed to rest.

## The Prosecution’s Case

10     The Prosecution’s main witnesses were the victim, PW1 and PW4.

### Evidence from the victim

11     Although the victim did an internship with the company sometime in 2016 or 2017, she only started her full-time work from 26 November 2018. This was about three weeks before the party. When she joined the company, she was in the UX Team together with one “KC” and the Accused. She worked closely with the Accused, and found him to be a nice and caring colleague. Prior to the incident, she had no disputes with him.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

12     On the day of the party, the victim had intended to stay overnight. She also described that she was wearing a bra and bandeau under her toga dress costume that night. While the toga dress was not a “snuggle fit”[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) and was quite loose around the neck hole area, the bandeau was made of very stretchy material and was a “very tight fit”.[^4] In the course of the party and games, she had four coconut husks of alcoholic drink, and a couple of shots. After that, she felt lightheaded and her ability to process information was impacted. Her motor skills were also affected and she felt very tired and sleepy.[^5]

13     She was not actively checking the time, and could only gauge that sometime past 11 p.m., she fell asleep on the sofa and PW4 helped her get up to the second storey of the chalet. She was later told by PW4 that DW3 had also helped her up, although she was not able to recall this. She described herself as being “largely asleep”.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) The victim remembered going to the toilet first to try and vomit, and then entering the bedroom nearer the toilet (“Bedroom 2”)[^7] and falling asleep on the bed closer to the door. She did not remember if anyone else was in Bedroom 2 at that point. She was still wearing her toga dress costume.

14     Sometime later, she vaguely remembered someone holding her shoulder and trying to move her and asking her if she was okay. She heard the voice coming from her right side, and the person asked her if she was okay multiple times, although she did not recognise the voice. She mumbled back, trying to say that she was okay but it did not come out as a full sentence. She then fell back asleep. Shortly after, she felt some light touches on her tummy area and upper left chest. The touches felt like gentle taps from a human hand and she did not think much of them. She did not open her eyes. She thought that a colleague was trying to wake her up. She was lying flat on her back throughout this time.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

15     The victim did not remember if she turned her body at this point, but she recalled that her ending position was lying flat on the bed, with her head tilted towards the left.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) She then opened her eyes briefly and saw PW1 sitting up from the other bed. Although the room lights were off, the room was relatively bright because of the light coming in through the window. The victim saw that PW1 was facing the direction of the door, and appeared to be sitting up in response to someone in the direction of the door.[^10] The victim also heard some noises during this time but she could not remember what she heard. The victim fell back asleep.

16     Shortly after this, the victim felt a hand grabbing and squeezing her left breast very aggressively, and also someone kissing her on her mouth. These two actions happened at about the same time. The grabbing and squeezing of her breast initially took place over her clothes, then it went under the toga dress, the bandeau and eventually under her bra. It took the victim some time to process what was happening to her, and when she did, she used her right hand to try and push the person away. Her right arm made contact with the person’s left shoulder, which gave her the impression that he was either on top of her or on her right side.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

17     The victim opened her eyes and saw the upper portion of the Accused’s face, from his nose upwards. He was still kissing her at this point. She was shocked and could not believe that the Accused was the one doing this to her as he had always been a very nice colleague. The victim also described the grabbing and squeezing actions as aggressive and painful for her, and the kissing exerted a lot of pressure on her mouth.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) She tried to push him away but could not because she was too sleepy and tired.[^13] As the Accused’s head was on top of hers, and his hand was grabbing her left breast and exerting a downwards pressure, she could not move much.[^14] The victim also confirmed that she was not able to scream or make any noise because of the kiss.[^15]

18     As this incident of kissing and grabbing was very alarming to her, the victim was more awake and could remember most of the details.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) She also confirmed that she could see the upper part of the assailant’s face and features, and that it was the Accused.[^17]

19     The victim’s evidence was that the kissing and grabbing lasted for about three to five minutes, as it “felt very long”[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18). After it stopped, the victim heard voices coming from the direction of the door. The victim then fell back asleep as she was very tired.[^19]

20     Sometime after she fell back asleep, the victim remembered PW1 coming up to her and asking her to go home together. However, the victim told her that she was very tired and wanted to sleep for a bit longer. PW1 then let her go back to sleep. The victim also heard noises in the room and thought that people were shifting things out.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

21     Sometime later, the victim opened her eyes and saw the Accused walking at the end of her bed towards PW1 and PW4 who were seated on the other bed. She heard some talking but could not hear what it was about. She then went back to sleep.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

22     The next morning, the victim woke just before the sun came up. She had a headache and hangover. She was also still in shock over what had happened. When she woke, she found that her bandeau had fallen to her tummy area. This would not ordinarily have happened as it was very tight fitting. She associated this with what happened the night before.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

23     However, because of her hangover and the fact that there were many other colleagues around, she acted normally and planned to find out later from PW1 if she knew anything. At this point, the victim wanted to know if there could be any innocent explanation for what happened to her the night before. She wanted to be careful and was afraid of affecting the office dynamics as she would still have to work with the Accused in the future. She also felt that she was a newcomer at the company and the other colleagues would be closer to the Accused. She did not know what they would think of her if they heard about what happened. In addition, the victim knew that the Accused would be going on leave and vacation after the party, and felt that she had some time to deal with this issue.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23)

24     The victim and the Accused exchanged some messages on Whatsapp that morning, and the victim was still acting normally as she was trying to “think neutral” about the Accused, and could not believe that he would do that to her.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

25     The victim also exchanged some messages with PW1 that morning. In particular, PW1 told the victim that the next time “_we girls shouldn’t stay over night_”. PW1 also told the victim to be “_careful_” of the Accused, and not to get too close to him.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) To the victim’s mind, PW1 was hinting to her that the Accused did something to her last night,[^26] and this reaffirmed her belief that the Accused had assaulted her and that there did not seem to be an innocent explanation for his actions.[^27]

26     The following Monday at the office (17 December 2018), the victim and PW1 met up to speak a bit more about this incident. They also discussed this in greater detail at a lunch meeting the next day. PW1 told her that the Accused first came into the room to ask if the victim was okay. She later saw the Accused pull down the victim’s dress and kiss her left breast. He also took a picture of the victim. PW1 sat up and tried to stop him. She ran out of the room to look for help downstairs. She later came back upstairs with “TC” and PW4. They got the Accused out of the room and PW1 asked the victim to go back home with her but the victim was too tired. PW1 then sat in the room to look after her. PW1 also told her that at one point when they were in the room and the door was locked, the Accused had tried to return. He came back multiple times and lingered around the room and outside, before eventually leaving the chalet. After hearing from PW1, the victim felt that the Accused was not drunk at all, and had assaulted her intentionally.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

27     During this lunch meeting, the victim also told PW1 that the Accused grabbed and squeezed her breast, and kissed her.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

28     Prior to this talk with PW1, the victim had met up with PW4 on 17 December 2018 to talk about this incident. PW4 told her that the Accused was not that drunk, and confirmed that the Accused had tried to return to the room multiple times, using the excuse that his bag was in the room. Because of that, they moved all the bags out of the room.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

29     After all this, the victim felt that the Accused was not that drunk at all and had done those things to her intentionally. She decided to lodge a report with Human Resources (“HR”)[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) and the police[^32]. She wanted to lodge a report with HR because she did not feel that she could work with the Accused again. She wanted to lodge a police report because she wanted the photograph that the Accused took of her to be removed.[^33] The victim explained that she did not lodge a report with HR and the police earlier as she was afraid of affecting the Accused or her own employment, and of rumours being spread. She was also concerned about how HR would view the event as the party attendees had been drinking alcohol.[^34]

30     The HR report was lodged on 18 December 2018 while the police report was lodged on 20 December 2018. The victim explained that she wanted to talk to HR first before making a police report, in case there was anything which she should take note of. PW1 and PW4, together with a legal representative from the company, accompanied the victim to the police station on 20 December 2018.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

31     The victim’s evidence was that she felt betrayed by the Accused. Since the incident, she found it hard to trust people, especially men. She has also been keeping a distance from her colleagues, and cannot really drink alcohol leisurely with them anymore.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

### Evidence from PW1

32     PW1 worked in the ED Group at the company, and was colleagues with both the Accused and the victim at the material time. However, she was not close to the Accused as they were in different teams and did not work together much. Nevertheless, PW1 described the Accused as a friendly and nice person.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

33     PW1 gave evidence of an incident at a previous Christmas party where the Accused had hugged her from behind, and she felt quite uncomfortable. Since then, she had been a bit more “_cautious_” and “_careful_” of the Accused. However, she maintained that there were no disputes between the two of them.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

34     During the party on 13 December 2018, there were cooking and drinking games, which ended at about 11 p.m. By this time, PW1 had a bad headache from the alcohol, and was feeling a little dizzy, though she maintained that her speech and motor skills were not otherwise impaired and she was not drunk.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) PW4 asked her to go upstairs to take a rest, and he helped her up to Bedroom 2.[^40]

35     Upon reaching the bedroom, PW1 saw that the victim was lying on the bed closer to the door. Before that, PW4 had already told her that the victim was in the room. PW1 could see things in the room quite clearly because there was a big window where light was coming through. PW1 then went to the other bed nearer the window to lie down and rest. She fell asleep.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41)

36     Sometime later, she was woken up by the sound of the door opening and someone entering. She then heard the Accused calling out to the victim a few times and asking her if she was okay. She was lying on her right side and facing the door, and she saw the Accused and recognised his voice. The Accused moved to the side of the victim’s bed which was closer to the bed where PW1 was resting. PW1 heard the victim mumble in response. During this time, PW1 was intermittently opening and closing her eyes, as she was still resting and thought that the Accused was just being concerned about the victim.[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42)

37     PW1 then saw the Accused lying on the bed beside the victim and on the victim’s left. The Accused was lying on his stomach and the upper half of his body was propped up and he was leaning close to the victim. When she next opened her eyes, the Accused was in a half kneeling position beside the victim, and his hand was on the end of the victim’s toga dress near her arm pit area. The Accused’s head was near the victim’s left breast area and his right hand was on her toga. PW1 then saw the Accused’s right hand do a “_pulling down action_”[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43). At this point the Accused’s head also made a downwards movement at the victim’s breast area. PW1 could not see what the Accused did as his head was blocking her line of sight. At the same time, PW1 heard a sound which sounded like “_a bit of breathing in sound, a bit of smooching sound_”[^44]. PW1 also described it as a slurping sort of sound. It was quite loud, and PW1 gave evidence that her heart “_skipped a beat_”[^45] when she saw that. She then became frightened.[^46] She explained that this was the reason why she remembered this incident very clearly.[^47]

38     PW1 thought that the Accused was kissing the victim’s breast and was shocked. Her immediate reaction was to close her eyes as she did not want the Accused to know she was awake. She did not think she was in a good position to confront the Accused as she was still having a headache and she did not know if there was anyone else outside the room who could help.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48)

39     After a while, PW1 opened her eyes again and saw that the Accused was still leaning close to the victim, with a handphone in his hand.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) The Accused was “_aiming”[^50]_ the handphone at the victim’s face. At this point, the screen light from the phone was shining on the Accused’s face and PW1 could see that he was grinning.[^51] PW1 did not hear the sound of any photo being taken although she had the impression that the Accused was taking a photograph.[^52] Throughout this process, PW1 did not see or hear any reaction from the victim except for mumbling.[^53]

40     PW1 closed her eyes again but after a while, she pretended to wake and pushed herself up from the bed. She decided to do so as she felt that it was not safe for the victim if the Accused continued being in the room. She was worried that the Accused might continue touching or kissing the victim. The Accused appeared surprised when PW1 got up and he sat up on the bed and faced PW1. He asked if she was okay and she said yes. PW1 did not confront the Accused with what she saw earlier, as she was still concerned if there were other people outside who could help.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54)

41     After the Accused left the room, PW1 also left and went to the living room area on the first floor. From the clock in the living room, PW1 recalled that it was about 1.20 a.m. or 1.30 a.m. then.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55) She did not see the Accused around.[^56] She tried to get a close friend, “TC”, to help bring the victim home but they did not know the victim’s address. She later went to the main group at the living room to ask for help, and after one guy agreed to bring the victim home, she then went back up to try and get the victim’s address. “TC” and PW4 went up with her. PW4, upon seeing her pull “TC” away to talk earlier, had also followed to try and find out what happened. At this point, PW1’s evidence was that she did not share too many details with “TC” and PW4 because it was the victim’s privacy and she did not want to spread any rumour or gossip.[^57]

42     When PW1 opened the door to the bedroom again, she saw the Accused inside the room and on the right side of the victim. He was initially sitting but quickly stood up when they entered the room.[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58) PW1 was surprised to see him, and PW4 also expressed surprise and asked the Accused what he was doing in the girls’ room. The Accused replied that he was here to check on the victim. He then walked out of the room.[^59]

43     PW1 went to the victim to try and ask for her address but the victim was mumbling and could only whisper softly that she was too tired and couldn’t move.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) Finally, PW4 suggested that PW1 stay the night with the victim. PW1 agreed. PW1 and PW4 closed the bedroom door and sat down on the other bed, having a conversation about what happened earlier. PW1 shared that she saw something that wasn’t appropriate and there was some touching, but she did not tell him where and how, although she did tell him who.[^61]

44     After some time, the Accused opened the door and walked in. He sat on the victim’s bed, facing them, and asked them what they were talking about. They simply told him they were talking about work matters. Soon after, PW4 suggested that they leave the girls alone, and he went out with the Accused.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62)

45     PW1 also remembered that at one point, some people including DW2, entered the room to remove some boxes and props which had been left inside. After that, PW1 locked the room door and went to rest. Sometime later, PW1 heard someone trying to open the door. She waited for a while before opening it. She saw PW4 and “TC” outside. PW4 told her that the Accused had tried to open the door and he asked her to return to the room and lock the door. She did that and went to bed again.[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

46     At about 3 – 4 a.m., PW1 woke up and went out again to find that PW4 was trying to sleep outside their room. They had a conversation about what happened again, as well as other work matters. PW4 told her that the Accused had left. PW1 told PW4 that the Accused did something inappropriate but she did not give the exact details. PW4 asked her if she was going to tell the victim when she woke, but PW1 replied that she would not tell her directly as she did not want to be too harsh and straightforward. She was afraid that the victim would break down.[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64)

47     The next morning, the victim appeared normal as they cleared up the chalet together.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) PW1 did not directly broach the incident to the victim, but sent her Whatsapp messages[^66] after they parted ways to tell her to be careful of the Accused and not to stay overnight at such gatherings in the future. She was trying to give the victim a “hint”[^67], and planned to “slowly” let the victim know about what happened.[^68] PW1 did not tell the victim about what happened when she woke because she felt that it was not convenient to do so with other people around. She was also tired, and did not want to break the news too directly to the victim.[^69]

48     The week after the party, PW1 and the victim met up at the office and over lunch. PW1 told the victim that the Accused had done something to her and there was a “_pulling down_” of her toga.[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70) She also shared with the victim that the Accused had pointed his handphone at the victim’s face. The victim told PW1 that she had felt an unpleasant taste in her mouth, and there was some vigorous touching of her breast. PW1 did not probe further.[^71]

49     The victim told PW1 that she was thinking about whether to talk to HR about this. When PW1 learnt that the victim was going to lodge a police report, she was surprised. She asked the victim about this, and the victim told her that she was worried about any potential photos that might have been taken.[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72)

50     PW1 gave evidence that she did not think the Accused was drunk that night, as he was able to recognise her and the victim when he asked how they were. He was also able to walk normally.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73)

### Evidence from PW4

51     PW4 had been working in the EI Group at the company since March 2019. Prior to this stint, he had worked in the UX Team from May 2014 to July 2018. He knew the Accused and victim from his previous stint at the company, and confirmed that he had no disputes with the Accused.[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74)

52     On 13 December 2018 when he attended the party at the chalet, he was no longer working at the company, but had been invited there by an ex-colleague. Sometime past 11 p.m., while at the chalet, he was sitting and resting at the sofa area with some colleagues, including the victim. He noticed that the victim was lying down with her eyes closed and motionless. He realised she was very drunk and suggested to DW3 to bring her up to one of the rooms on the second floor for a rest. DW3 agreed and helped him bring the victim up. PW4’s evidence was that the victim had to be supported up the stairs, though she could still walk. They brought her to Bedroom 2 and left her lying on the bed nearer to the door. They then left the room. There was no one else in the room at that point.[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75)

53     PW4 went back to the ground floor, where he saw PW1 also lying motionless and looking asleep. He then offered to bring her up to the second floor. PW1 agreed, got up and walked to the second floor by herself. PW4 accompanied her just to make sure she would not stumble and fall while going up the stairs. PW1 entered Bedroom 2 and went to the bed further away from the door. At this point, the victim was still lying on the bed nearer to the door.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76)

54     PW4 then left the bedroom but saw the Accused entering the same bedroom soon after. He waited for the Accused to reappear, thinking that he might have gone inside to retrieve some personal belongings. When the Accused did not appear after some time, PW4 went to the room and opened the door. He saw the Accused in between the two beds and walking towards the direction of the foot of the beds. PW4 asked the Accused why he was inside the room, and asked him to go downstairs together. The Accused did not respond to his question, but walked out of the room. PW4 assumed that the Accused would be walking down together with him and he went ahead first. When he reached the ground floor, he realised that the Accused was not behind him, and nowhere in sight. He was puzzled, but did not further pursue the matter and went to chat with the rest of his ex-colleagues at the party.[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77)

55     Sometime later, PW4 saw PW1 come down from the second floor, looking like she was in a panic. She pulled “TC” aside to have a conversation. PW4 was a distance away and could not hear this conversation but sensing that something was amiss, he approached to find out more. He then heard PW1 saying that she needed to bring the victim back home. She quickly went back upstairs, followed by “TC” and PW4.[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78) PW1 opened the door to Bedroom 2, and they saw the Accused walk out of the room and left. PW4 did not recall if anyone spoke to the Accused at this point. PW1 and PW4 then went inside the room, and approached the victim to ask for her address. However, they did not get a response. They then sat on the other bed to discuss options. PW1 wanted to bring the victim home but PW4 told her it was not a good idea, given that it was in the middle of the night and PW1 herself was also drunk. PW4 also tried to find out what happened but PW1 did not give him any substantive responses. PW4 was under the impression that PW1 was having difficulty gauging how much she should tell him.[^79]

56     A short while later, the Accused entered the bedroom again, and went to lie down on the bed beside the victim. Both PW1 and PW4 were shocked and did not know how to respond. Soon after, DW2 entered the room and gave instructions to clear out the personal belongings. They cleared the room and left, including the Accused, leaving only PW1 and the victim in the bedroom. The door was then locked.[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80)

57     After clearing the room, PW4 sat at the staircase area on the second floor with “TC” for a chat. He tried to find out more about what happened from “TC”. After the conversation, he got the idea that the Accused had done something inappropriate to the victim in the bedroom, but he had no further details. Sometime later, as they were still talking, they saw the Accused trying to open the door to Bedroom 2. They did not see where the Accused had come from. PW4 asked him what he was trying to do, and the Accused responded that he was searching for something. “TC” and PW4 then told him that all the belongings had been placed outside the room. The Accused eventually took what appeared to be an empty carton box, and went downstairs. PW4 and “TC” continued their conversation at the staircase, and the Accused later came up to try and join in the conversation. After the conversation ended, they parted ways. PW4 took a mattress from the ground floor and slept outside Bedroom 2. Sometime in the night, he heard noises and woke. He opened his eyes and saw the Accused going down the stairs. PW4 then went back to sleep.[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81)

58     Sometime later, the door to Bedroom 2 opened and he woke up. PW1 came out of the room. Together they went downstairs and had a chat. When PW4 tried to ask her for details of what happened again, PW1 only told him that it was “bad” and “serious”[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82), and she confirmed that the Accused had done something inappropriate to the victim. They then proceeded to talk about other things and PW1 shared with him her own experience at a previous Christmas party where the Accused had hugged her from the back and shocked her. PW4 asked PW1 what she intended to do about what she saw, but PW4 expressed that she did not know how the victim would take the information, and she was concerned about the victim’s well-being. PW4 was under the impression that PW1 was quite stressed about the situation, as she did not know if she should tell the victim. Eventually, the implicit understanding they arrived at was that they would check on the victim’s well-being and see how she reacted. Whatever decision the victim made, they would support her.[^83]

59     When the victim eventually woke, they asked her how she was, and she said she was fine. She looked well to them too. Neither of them broached the topic of what happened to the victim that morning. PW4 felt that the ball was in PW1’s court as he did not know any details. He was also not sure how she would take the news and he was concerned about “_doing damage_”.[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84)

60     Throughout his interaction with the Accused that night, PW4 could not tell if the Accused was drunk. PW4 recalled seeing the Accused drunk and resting earlier in the night[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85), but when he saw the Accused in Bedroom 2 subsequently, the Accused looked fine and could walk straight. Therefore, PW4 was of the view that the Accused had recovered and was “_probably not very drunk_” at that point. PW4 also gave evidence that from what he had seen at previous Christmas parties involving the Accused, the Accused had a tendency to fall asleep when he was drunk.[^86]

61     After the party, PW4 continued to check in on the victim via Whatsapp[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87). Although he did not directly tell the victim what happened as he was not sure what she knew and did not want to cause further damage to her, he eventually discovered that the victim herself was in fact aware that the Accused had done something to her that night.[^88] They met up in the evening of 17 December 2018, and although PW4 did not specifically recall what they spoke about, he inferred from the later messages that he must have shared with the victim what he saw that night.[^89]

62     PW4 confirmed that in December 2018, the Accused’s employment at the company had nothing to do with his own decision whether to re-join the company, and that in fact he was in discussions at the material time for a job opening in a new department, the EI Group.[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90) PW4 also confirmed that his departure from the company in July 2018 had nothing to do with the Accused.[^91]

### Evidence from other Prosecution witnesses

63     PW3 Leong Man Shi (“PW3 Leong”) was the Mandarin translator who assisted to translate the Whatsapp exchanges between the victim and PW4. This translated document was admitted and marked P12. On the stand, PW3 Leong was asked to translate some of the Mandarin messages in P10, which also contained a series of messages between the victim and PW4.

64     PW5 Inspector Ong Chun Kiat (“PW5 Insp Ong”) was the initial investigating officer for the case. His evidence was that he first contacted the Accused on 3 January 2019, to request for him to come down for a statement recording. PW5 Insp Ong told the Accused that a report had been lodged against him, but did not reveal any other details. After recording an investigative statement from the Accused, PW5 Insp Ong then went on to record a cautioned statement under s 23 of the CPC from the Accused.[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92) The Accused denied the allegations.

65     In the course of the statement recording, PW5 Insp Ong seized the Accused’s mobile phone and searched it to see if he could find any photographs of the victim lying on the bed. He did not find any. He subsequently sent the mobile phone for forensic analysis to retrieve deleted photos and videos, but the examination did not turn up any relevant photos. Based on the call records and photographs found in the mobile phone, PW5 Insp Ong believed that this was the same mobile phone which the Accused was using at the material time of the incident.

66     In cross examination, PW5 Insp Ong confirmed that he did not record a statement from the victim, and did not interview her in the course of investigations. He recorded a statement from PW1 on 27 December 2018, and a statement from PW4 on 3 January 2019, before the Accused came down for his statement recording.

### A chronology of the messages between the victim, PW1 and PW4

67     Evidence was tendered of Whatsapp messages which the victim had exchanged with PW1 and PW4, and which were generally consistent with the victim’s account that she had been sexually assaulted by the Accused on the night of the party. Some salient portions in chronological order are set out below.

## The Defence Case

68     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, I found that a _prima facie_ case had been made out against the Accused on the charge, and called on the Accused to give his defence accordingly. The Accused chose to give evidence in his own defence, and also called two other witnesses.

### Evidence from the Accused

69     The Accused gave evidence that he first joined the company in 2010 and was in the UX Team, until he was terminated in the beginning of 2019. He first met the victim as an intern in the UX Team in 2016 or 2017. The other member of the team was one “KC Yong”. After the internship ended, the victim left and later re-joined the UX Team in 2018. The Accused reported that he found her work to be satisfactory.[\[note: 123\]](#Ftn_123)

70     On 13 December, the Accused arrived at the chalet party at about 4.30 p.m. He placed his belongings in Bedroom 2, together with the rest of his party team, including DW3. There was no demarcation of rooms for males and females[\[note: 124\]](#Ftn_124). He drank some alcohol and mingled with everyone. Sometime around midnight, the party ended as the eating, drinking and games were over. The Accused continued sitting around to chat with his colleagues.

71     Sometime towards the later part of the party at about 12.30 a.m. to 1 a.m. on 14 December, the Accused went up to the toilet on the second floor to throw up. After doing so, he went into Bedroom 2 to retrieve his clothes and went back to the toilet to change out of his costume and into a blue T-shirt. The light in Bedroom 2 was not on and he did not notice anyone inside. After he was done changing, he went back to Bedroom 2 to put his things, before going back downstairs. He decided to take a rest on an empty seat and managed to doze off. He was feeling sleepy because of the drinks he had. The Accused confirmed that his position was as set out in the bottom photo of exhibit D2 page 50.[\[note: 125\]](#Ftn_125)

72     The Accused explained that while he intended to return home, it was a long walk out to the guardhouse where he could get a taxi, and he had many things to carry. As such, he decided to try and get some rest first.[\[note: 126\]](#Ftn_126)

73     At about 1.30 a.m., one “WY” asked the Accused if he wanted to leave. However, the Accused saw that DW3 was packed and ready to leave too, and as “WY” only had a two-seater vehicle, the Accused decided to let DW3 leave with “WY” instead. He then went back to resting in the chair.[\[note: 127\]](#Ftn_127)

74     After resting for a while, the Accused woke up and wanted to return home. He then headed upstairs to retrieve his belongings from Bedroom 2. Along the way, he saw “TC” and PW4 sitting on the second floor landing, near the staircase. He did not speak to them, and walked past them to open the door to Bedroom 2 before going in.[\[note: 128\]](#Ftn_128) He did not close the door after he went in. He headed to his belongings which were near the foot of the beds, and in the area in between the two beds.[^129] As he was reaching down for his belongings, he suddenly felt “unstable”.[^130] As such, he looked at the beds to search for a place to rest. He saw that each bed had a figure on it, although he could not see who they were, or whether they were male or female. The room was dark and unlit, and the figures appeared to be “wrapped up” in something. The Accused thought that the figures could be under the bed covers. As he saw that there was more space on the bed closer to the door, he crawled onto that bed with his knees and elbows, and tried to make more space for himself by pushing the figure over the shoulder, body and hip areas. He did not reach under the cover, and tried pushing the figure over the cover. However, this did not work and the figure did not respond to him. The Accused then decided to just lie down anyway with whatever space there was. [^131] He settled down on his back, facing the ceiling, and closed his eyes. His legs were mostly not on the bed, because the top half of the bed was occupied by the figure, and he was mostly on the lower half of the bed.[^132]

75     He drifted, but after a while, felt that the position was not very comfortable. He therefore got up and went to his belongings to retrieve his mobile phone. He tried a few times to call for a Grab taxi but was unsuccessful. He stood up for a few minutes doing this. He then put his mobile phone back and went to the same bed to lie down again. He managed to doze off.[\[note: 133\]](#Ftn_133)

76     Sometime later, he heard someone call his name, and when he opened his eyes, he saw DW2 standing near him. Apart from DW2, he did not see anyone else. The Accused got up and went to use the toilet. After coming out from the toilet, the Accused saw “TC” and PW4 sitting in the same place along the landing. The Accused then went to have a chat with them. Soon after, the Accused felt hungry and went down to the kitchen to look for something to eat. He found some noodles and ate that. After that, he went back up to try and find a place to rest again. As he knew that there was not much space in Bedroom 2, he went into Bedroom 1, where he found an empty bed to rest on. At this point, “TC” and PW4 were still on the landing. He got some sleep, and woke up feeling better. He then wanted to head home and tried to go back to Bedroom 2 to retrieve his belongings. However, the door to Bedroom 2 was locked. He then started to look around and noticed his belongings on the second floor landing. There was no one around at that point, and “TC” and PW4 were no longer present. The Accused then got his mobile phone and managed to get a taxi. As such, he took his belongings and left. This was sometime before 4 a.m. on 14 December 2018.[\[note: 134\]](#Ftn_134)

77     The Accused also recounted an occasion where he had walked into Bedroom 2 and saw PW1 and PW4 sitting on the bed nearer the window. He walked over and had a casual conversation with them while standing. He was not sure which part of the night this was, but it was probably after he had changed into his T-shirt. The Accused was able to recognise the two of them and see their faces, and the light in the room was on. At this point, there was a figure on the bed nearer the door, but he could not make out who it was as the figure was “wrapped up”.[\[note: 135\]](#Ftn_135)

78     At about 10.30 a.m. on 14 December 2018, the Accused messaged his party team members on Whatsapp, and also decided to drop the victim a message to ask how she was, as she was in the same UX Team as him. He was taken aback when she sent him the GIF animation with heart shapes, as he felt that they were not that close. He had seldom engaged in Whatsapp messaging with her prior to this.[\[note: 136\]](#Ftn_136)

79     On 14 December 2018, the Accused left for a holiday in Thailand. While he was in Thailand, he messaged the victim once regarding work. He returned to Singapore on 2 January 2019, and went to the office on 3 January 2019. He was requested to hand over his work items as there was an investigation going on. No further details were provided to him. The Accused was confused and upset. Later that same day, he received a call from PW5 Insp Ong who asked to meet up at the Ang Mo Kio police station. The Accused tried to ask what it was about but PW5 Insp Ong did not tell him. The Accused arrived at the police station at about 3 p.m. When he met up with PW5 Insp Ong, PW5 Insp Ong showed him a charge sheet[\[note: 137\]](#Ftn_137) and told him that there was a charge against him and that the victim had made allegations against him. The Accused was shocked. PW5 Insp Ong then proceeded to interview him. His mobile phone was also detained by PW5 Insp Ong.[^138]

80     The Accused first learnt that the victim was the person on the bed which he had been sharing in Bedroom 2, when he met DW2 sometime in February 2019. DW2 told him that PW1 was the person on the other bed.[\[note: 139\]](#Ftn_139)

81     The Accused denied kissing or touching the victim, and he also denied taking any photographs of the victim while she was lying in bed. The Accused confirmed that he was not drunk on the night in question, and agreed that he was able to think rationally and could recall what happened with some clarity.[\[note: 140\]](#Ftn_140)

82     The Accused agreed that he knew of no reason why the victim, PW1 or PW4 would want to get him into trouble, and he had no previous interpersonal disputes with the three of them.[\[note: 141\]](#Ftn_141)

83     The Defence applied to admit both the Accused’s investigative and cautioned statements into evidence, and they were marked D6 and D8 respectively. In the statements, the Accused denied the offences and gave an account which was largely consistent with his evidence in court.

84     The Accused also called two witnesses in his defence – DW2 and DW3.

### Evidence from DW2

85     DW2 was a director at the company. He was present at the party on 13 December, and his evidence was that at the chalet, they did not specify which bedroom was meant for the males, and which was meant for the females.[\[note: 142\]](#Ftn_142)

86     Sometime before he returned home at about 2 or 2.25 a.m. on 14 December 2018, he went up to the second level to check on how everyone was doing. He saw PW4 and “TC” inside Bedroom 2 and near the door, and approached them to ask what was going on. DW2 saw that the Accused and the victim were lying down on the bed closer to the bedroom door, while PW1 was on the other bed. He did not think the room light was on, but he could see everyone as there was light coming either from the corridor or somewhere nearby.[\[note: 143\]](#Ftn_143)

87     The victim was lying on her side and under the cover, while the Accused was lying face up and over the cover. The victim was not very conscious at that point, and did not appear to be able to get up from the bed, or to talk properly. However, she was not asleep.[\[note: 144\]](#Ftn_144) He heard PW1 ask the Accused to go out of the room, and so DW2 asked the Accused to leave as well. He could see that the girls were feeling uncomfortable with the Accused’s presence. The Accused got up and said he was going to the toilet, and left. He appeared drowsy. DW2 asked PW1 if there was anything in the room that did not belong to them. PW1 pointed out the Accused’s belongings, and DW2 then brought the Accused’s belongings out and asked PW1 to lock the door and rest. PW4 and “TC” were at the level 2 landing area at that point, so DW2 asked them to stay there to make sure the girls were alright. PW4 and “TC” then sat at the landing area while DW2 left.[^145]

88     DW2 also recounted an incident when he was chatting with some people on the ground floor when PW1 came down from the second level looking nervous and urgently pulled “TC” away to talk to him in the kitchen. DW2 did not ask her what happened and she did not tell him either. Soon after, PW1 and “TC” went up to level 2 together.[\[note: 146\]](#Ftn_146)

### Evidence from DW3

89     DW3 was a manager at the company, and present at the party on 13 December 2018. Her evidence was that there was no division of the bedrooms for males and females. She also gave evidence that she kept her personal belongings in Bedroom 2, together with her other party team members, including the Accused.[\[note: 147\]](#Ftn_147)

90     DW3 recalled that sometime after the party ended and people were sitting around and mingling, she assisted both the victim and PW1 up to Bedroom 2. This was done separately, and with the help of PW4. They first brought the victim to Bedroom 2 and placed her on the bed closer to the door, before leaving the room. DW3 described the victim as being “tipsy”.[\[note: 148\]](#Ftn_148) DW3 went back downstairs, and after a while, together with PW4, helped to bring PW1 up to Bedroom 2 as well. PW1 was brought to the other bed in Bedroom 2. DW3 also described PW1 as being “tipsy”.[^149]

91     The room light was off at that point. After bringing PW1 up, DW3 took her clothes from her belongings in Bedroom 2 and went to change out of her costume. When she went back to the room after changing, she did not see anyone else in the room apart from the victim and PW1. She then went downstairs to chat and have some food.[\[note: 150\]](#Ftn_150)

92     After some time, she went back up to Bedroom 2 to get her personal belongings as she wanted to leave. She saw PW4 at the second floor landing area. When she tried to open the door to Bedroom 2, it was locked. She knocked, and the victim opened the door. She did not speak to the victim, and the victim did not say anything before returning back to the bed. PW1 was sleeping on the other bed. DW3 then took her personal belongings and left the bedroom. She did not close the door. PW4 was still at the landing area when she went downstairs.[\[note: 151\]](#Ftn_151)

93     When DW3 went back downstairs, she saw the Accused resting in a chair.[\[note: 152\]](#Ftn_152) She did not recall the time this occurred, but gave evidence that it would have been past 1 a.m. She spoke to the Accused and told him that she was leaving with another colleague. She then left the chalet.[^153]

## Court’s Decision on Conviction

### The law – elements of the offence

94     There are two main elements to the offence of outrage of modesty[\[note: 154\]](#Ftn_154), and in the present case it would translate to the following:

> (a)     The Accused had used criminal force against the victim (by kissing her mouth, grabbing and squeezing her left breast with his hand, both over and under her clothes); and

> (b)     The Accused had the intention to outrage the modesty of the victim.

95     The Prosecution’s evidence for the first element lay almost entirely on the victim’s evidence as, like the case in most of such offences, there was no other witness present at the material time of the offence. The Accused also denied that any criminal force was applied on the victim at all.

### The victim’s evidence was credible

96     The victim’s evidence was clear and consistent. According to her, she had been in a “largely asleep” state at the material time, but woke to someone grabbing and squeezing her left breast aggressively, and kissing her mouth. Her evidence was also that the grabbing and squeezing of her breast took place initially over her clothes, but eventually went under her toga dress, bandeau and bra. She then opened her eyes and saw the upper portion of the Accused’s face. She tried to resist but failed as she was sleepy and tired. When she heard voices coming from the direction of the door, the assault stopped and she fell back asleep.

97     In assessing the credibility of her evidence, there were a few aspects which required closer examination.

98     The first is the victim’s evidence that she went back to sleep after the aggressive assault. Her explanation for this was very simple – she was tired and sleepy. This is perhaps not something one would expect of a person who has suffered a sexual assault, especially an assault of a forceful nature like the one described by the victim. However, I did not think this evidence was unbelievable. It was not in dispute that the victim had consumed a significant quantity of alcohol that night, and the reason why she was in Bedroom 2 was because of the alcohol-induced largely non-functional state she was in. The evidence from the other witnesses showed that the victim was not in a fully conscious state at the material time. PW4’s evidence was that the victim was very drunk and lying down motionless on the sofa when he decided to bring her up to the bedroom to rest. The victim also had to be supported up the stairs. When PW1 tried to wake the victim later in order to bring her home, her evidence was that all the victim could manage was a soft whisper that she was too tired. Even DW2 agreed that when he saw the victim on the bed in Bedroom 2, she was “not very conscious”[\[note: 155\]](#Ftn_155) and did not appear able to get up from the bed or to talk properly.

99     There was therefore no doubt in my mind that the victim’s consumption of alcohol on the night in question had impacted on her ability to process information, to move around or to speak. Alcohol affects different people in different ways, and it was not unbelievable that the effect on the victim was such that even though the aggressive assault had woken her up enough for her to realise that something was happening to her, she was not able to put up a strong resistance, and after the assault subsided and the adrenaline drained, she continued being so tired and sleepy that she was not able to stay awake or alert long. To my mind, this was a plausible state of affairs.

100    Another aspect of her evidence which required closer examination involved the identification of the Accused. The victim was very clear in her evidence that it was the Accused who assaulted her. She never wavered on this point. And yet, as the Defence pointed out, the victim had opened her eyes only when the aggressor was kissing her. In other words, she would not have had a chance to see his full face. In all likelihood, she was only able to see the upper part of his face – nose, eyes and forehead. Was this sufficient for her to be able to recognise the aggressor? I believed so. If it had been a stranger who was assaulting her, the victim would no doubt have great difficulty trying to provide a facial composite or to be able to pick the correct person at an identification parade. I believe, however, that the situation is different when the person is someone she knows. She would have already been familiar with the Accused’s face, body and mannerisms, and would not have required a view of all his facial features before she was able to identify him. I therefore found that it was entirely possible for the victim to have recognised the Accused during the time of the assault and when she opened her eyes.

101    The Defence also raised the point that it was in the dark when this happened. However, I did not think this affected the identification evidence much. First, the evidence from the witnesses showed that even when the room lights were not on, the room was relatively bright because of the lights streaming in through the large window. This was also the evidence from the defence witness DW2. Second, the victim was not suddenly plunged in darkness. She had been sleeping in the dark room when this happened and would not have to deal with the issue of dark adaptation. Given the proximity of the person who was kissing her, I did not see any reason why the victim would have difficulty identifying him. The victim confirmed that from the features she saw, the person was the Accused.[\[note: 156\]](#Ftn_156)

102    In any case, I also found that the victim’s identification evidence was supported by evidence from PW1. I will elaborate on this further below.

103    The third aspect of her evidence which required closer examination was her post incident behaviour in acting normally when she woke, and in later even engaging in a friendly Whatsapp conversation with the Accused on the morning of 14 December 2018.

104    The first principle to be observed is that victims of sexual crimes cannot be straightjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner.[\[note: 157\]](#Ftn_157) Not every victim will be able to confront their attacker directly and immediately after the assault. In fact, I am not sure that it is at all reasonable to expect a victim of a sexual assault to do so, given the nature of such an assault which will frequently leave a victim feeling ashamed and humiliated, and the usually different status between the victim (female) and offender (male). In the present case, the Accused was also the victim’s senior at the workplace.

105    The victim explained that when she woke the next morning, she was still in shock and in a state of hangover. As there were many other colleagues around, she decided to act normally first and then find out later from PW1 if she knew anything. The victim was still trying to find out if there could be an innocent explanation for what happened the night before. As the newcomer in the company, she felt that she was in a disadvantageous position and that people would more likely choose to believe the Accused than her. When the Accused first messaged her that morning, she was trying to act normally as she was still in disbelief and trying to “_think neutral_” about the Accused.

106    I found her behaviour and her explanation perfectly within the realm of reasonable possibilities. I also did not read very much into the kisses GIF which she sent to the Accused. The victim explained that this was the GIF which she normally used to show appreciation to her colleagues,[\[note: 158\]](#Ftn_158) and this was also borne out by the fact that she sent the same GIF in a conversation with PW1 that same morning.[^159]

107    On the whole, I therefore found the victim’s evidence to be reasonable and credible. I also noted that there was nothing before me to suggest that the victim might have had any reason to make false allegations against the Accused, and to make herself go through this entire process on the basis of a complete fabrication. In cross examination, it was put to the victim that she hoped that by making this complaint against the Accused, he would be removed by the company, thereby paving the way for PW4 to return.[\[note: 160\]](#Ftn_160) However, this was entirely hypothetical, and not supported by any evidence. In fact, the evidence was that when PW4 eventually came back to the company, his portfolio was not the same, and he had not taken over the Accused’s work.

108    For completeness, I will deal briefly with some of the other areas highlighted by the Defence regarding the victim’s evidence.

109    The victim admitted that she had dramatized certain aspects of the report to HR[\[note: 161\]](#Ftn_161) because she wanted HR to act promptly on the matter. She also admitted that certain portions of the HR report were not entirely accurate, as she had pieced together information she obtained from other parties like PW1 and PW4 as well. However, she maintained that she did not make up the details. I did not find that the victim’s credibility was affected by the HR report. I accepted her explanation for why she chose to use certain exaggerated language in it, and also took the view that it was perfectly natural for a person to piece together an account from both first-hand and second-hand information. I do not think it is reasonable or realistic to expect a lay person to be always mindful of keeping his/her language precise and confined to only what he/she saw or heard directly. I would also note that at the point of submitting this HR report, the victim had just had conversations with PW1 and PW4, and having found out more details of what had happened that night, would understandably be agitated and emotional. To expect her to still maintain a completely objective stand in her language when describing a sexual assault that had happened to her, would be to expect her to be a saint. In any case, I did not find the language she adopted to be unusually dramatic or exaggerated.

110    The Defence also seemed to suggest that the victim had concocted out the details of the offence after her conversations with PW1 and PW4. However, an examination of the chronology of events and Whatsapp messages that were sent between the parties would show that no one had in fact told the victim that her breast had been grabbed or that she had been kissed on her mouth. The details in the charge clearly came from the victim herself[\[note: 162\]](#Ftn_162). On the morning of 14 December 2018, PW1 had messaged the victim and, quite out of the blue, told her to be careful of the Accused. Tellingly, the victim did not express any surprise or bewilderment, but merely said that she guessed she might know what happened, and that though she was “_doubting that memory_”[^163], she now knew. This was a clear indication to me that the victim was herself aware that something had taken place the night before involving the Accused. The fact that she had been “_doubting that memory_” was merely consistent with her evidence of trying to find out if there could have been an innocent explanation for what happened, and that she was trying to “_think neutral_” of the Accused. The subsequent messages that followed with PW1 and PW4 confirmed that the victim had already identified the Accused as the perpetrator of the assault, and this was not an idea put into her head by anyone else. I therefore did not find that her evidence was contaminated in any way by PW1 or PW4.

111    In addition, the Defence highlighted that the victim’s evidence appeared inconsistent with regard to whether or not her bandeau had fallen to her tummy area in the morning of 14 December 2018 when she woke. I did not find the victim’s evidence in this respect to be inconsistent. The victim had given evidence that when she woke the next morning, her bandeau fell to her tummy area, and that this would not have happened naturally as it was a tight bandeau.[\[note: 164\]](#Ftn_164) In her message exchanges with PW1 and PW4, she did not tell them this detail, and instead maintained that her clothes were not taken off, and her “bra and bandeau were still on”[^165] In court, she explained that this was because her clothes were still on her, and though her bandeau had fallen to her tummy area, the important point was that she was still dressed. She therefore did not feel that it was necessary to tell her friends the detail involving her bandeau. I accepted this explanation. After all, this was an intimate detail which one wouldn’t expect the victim to broadcast so readily without good reason. The fact that her bandeau may have fallen out of place when she woke, is not inconsistent with her telling her friends that her clothes were not taken off her, and that was why she did not suspect that anything worse than the kissing or rubbing of her breast happened.

112    On the whole, I found that the victim’s evidence was clear and consistent, and there appeared to be no reason to disbelieve her. Nevertheless, there were certain aspects of her evidence, as detailed above, which although fell within the realm of reasonable possibilities, prevented her evidence by itself, from amounting to unusually convincing evidence sufficient to secure a conviction of the Accused. I now turn to the other evidence which, in my view, corroborated the victim’s account.

### Victim’s evidence was corroborated

113    I found that the victim’s evidence was corroborated by the evidence from the other witnesses, as well as the Whatsapp messages which the victim later exchanged with both PW1 and PW4.

114    Although there was no witness who directly saw the incident reflected in the charge, I found that the evidence from PW1 strongly supported the victim’s account. According to PW1, the Accused had entered Bedroom 2 sometime in the course of the night when both the victim and herself were resting, and the Accused had also appeared to have done something inappropriate to the victim. In particular, PW1 saw actions which looked like the Accused was pulling down the victim’s toga dress, and kissing her breast. PW1 did not actually see the kissing or the dress being pulled down, due to the position of the Accused’s head which partially blocked her view, and the fact that she was alarmed and chose to shut her eyes in order not to let the Accused know she was awake or had witnessed anything. However, she saw the Accused leaning in close to the victim, with his right hand near the victim’s left breast and armpit area. She also later saw a “pulling down kind of action”[\[note: 166\]](#Ftn_166) from his right hand, and at the same time the Accused’s face was very close to the victim’s breast area and PW1 heard a “smooching sound”[^167]. PW1 also later saw the Accused with his handphone. He was leaning close to the victim, and appeared to be “pointing”[^168] the handphone to the victim’s face, giving her the impression that he was taking a photograph of the victim. When PW1 later pretended to wake, her evidence was that the Accused seemed surprised and he then sat up and faced her.

115    I accepted PW1’s evidence with regard to what she saw and heard in Bedroom 2 that night. Like the victim, I found PW1 to be a credible witness who gave clear and consistent evidence. I was also satisfied that she was an objective and independent witness. Although she appeared to have had a negative experience with the Accused in the past, I did not find that she had any particular agenda to pursue against the Accused. She was reasonable in her evidence, agreeing that she thought the Accused was a nice and friendly person. She also candidly agreed with the Defence that she did not actually see any touching or kissing, and that she made assumptions based on the movement of the Accused and his proximity to certain parts of the victim’s body at the material time. However, she maintained what she saw, and affirmed that she had felt alarmed and threatened at the material time. I would also note that evidence from PW4 and DW2 regarding how PW1 had later appeared on the ground floor in a panicked state, wanting to bring the victim home, corroborated her account to a certain extent. In addition, her evidence was also somewhat corroborated by the victim’s own evidence that she had initially heard someone ask her multiple times if she was okay, and she had felt light touches on her body soon after.

116    I therefore accepted that sometime around 1 a.m. on 14 December 2018[\[note: 169\]](#Ftn_169), PW1 had seen the Accused do something inappropriate to the victim in Bedroom 2. For reasons I will detail below, I did not think that PW1’s account could be reconciled with the Accused’s account of him trying to push the victim in order to make space for himself on the same bed.

117    PW1’s evidence was also that when she went back up to the bedroom a short while later (together with “TC” and PW4), she saw the Accused in the room with the victim again.

118    While PW1’s evidence was not directly corroborative of the details in the charge, it was important background evidence. This was especially so in view of the victim’s own evidence that it was sometime after the assault that she heard PW1 ask her to go home with her. Read together, the victim and PW1’s evidence clearly placed the Accused in the bedroom at the material time of the offence.

119    What their evidence amounted to was this: the Accused had entered Bedroom 2 sometime around 1 a.m., at a time when both PW1 and the victim were resting, and had done something inappropriate to the victim. During this time, the Accused thought that PW1 was asleep. When PW1 “woke up”, the Accused was surprised and sat up quickly. He later left the room, but was later seen by PW1 in Bedroom 2 again, alone with the victim. In particular, PW1 saw him standing up by the side of the victim’s bed. In between the time when PW1 first left the bedroom to the time when she came back and saw the Accused again, the assault had occurred, because after PW1 returned to the bedroom, she almost immediately went to ask the victim to go home with her.

120    When we take this evidence together with the victim’s affirmative evidence that she had opened her eyes and saw that it was the Accused who had grabbed her breast and kissed her, there was no real doubt in my mind that the victim had been correct in her identification of the Accused. The idea that someone else had, in the course of all of this happening in the background, somehow sneaked in and similarly assaulted the victim while making the victim think that he was the Accused, was too far-fetched and without any basis whatsoever.

121    Furthermore, as indicated above, the Whatsapp conversations that took place between the victim and PW1 and PW4 after the incident, was also consistent with the victim’s account of the assault. In particular, the victim’s conversation with PW1 on the morning of 14 December 2018 indicated that she already knew that something had happened to her the night before involving the Accused. Her later conversations with PW4 confirmed this, and she had also described what she remembered having happened to her in both her messages to PW1[\[note: 170\]](#Ftn_170) and PW4[^171]. On the whole, I found both the contents and tenor of the messages to be consistent with her account of having been assaulted by the Accused in the early hours of 14 December 2018.

### Accused’s account was not credible

122    In contrast to the evidence from the victim and PW1, I found the Accused’s account of events to be inherently incredible, and externally inconsistent with the evidence from the other witnesses, including DW2.

123    The Accused’s explanation for why he happened to be in Bedroom 2 and lying on the same bed as the victim, was that he was feeling unstable and needed to find a place to rest. As such, what PW1 thought were inappropriate actions from the Accused, was actually just him pushing the victim to make space on the bed for himself. This account had many problems.

124    First, the obvious point is that the Accused ought to have at least tried to ascertain who it was who was lying on the bed before he tried to physically move the person, or to lie down beside the person. The Accused agreed that it was generally not appropriate for women and men to share a bedroom[\[note: 172\]](#Ftn_172), and that if he had known that the persons lying on the beds in Bedroom 2 were females, he would not have rested there.[^173] Yet according to his own evidence, he made no effort to ascertain who the persons were, and throughout the time he was there - from the time he lay down, to the time he stood up to use his handphone to try and find a Grab ride home, to the time he lay down again and later stood up to go to the toilet, he never found out or tried to find out who those persons in the room were.

125    This was incredible, not least because everyone else seemed to have no difficulty ascertaining the identity of persons in the room. PW1’s evidence was that the room was quite bright even though the lights were off, because of the large windows, and she could see that it was the Accused who had entered the room. When DW2 later went up to check in on Bedroom 2, the room light was not on, but he could still easily identify the persons in the room.

126    The issue of dark adaptation does not assist the Accused. Even if it had been dark in the bedroom when the Accused first went in, his eyes should have adjusted a short while later to allow him to be able to see who were on the beds, or at least to ascertain whether the persons were male or female. However, according to him, he made no such effort. He did not even bother trying to call out to the person lying on the bed to move. Instead, he rather presumptuously decided to simply start pushing the person away. This is contradictory to his own evidence that he would not have rested in the bedroom if he had known the occupants were female. Although the Accused may have been unstable or dizzy, he agreed that he was not drunk, and that he was able to think rationally that night. There was therefore no good explanation for his alleged actions. One would also have expected that if the Accused were so dizzy that he simply had to lie down quickly, he would have just done so without having to go to the effort of crawling onto the bed and then trying to push the other person away. After all, according to his own evidence, the Accused did not succeed in moving the person away eventually, and yet he still managed to find a spot to lie down successfully for a while. I further note that according to the Accused, he got up after a while and stood for a few minutes using his handphone to try and get a Grab ride home, before going back to the same space to lie down. This further indicated to me that the Accused cannot have been in such a state that he needed to lie down immediately to rest. If he could stand up for a few minutes to check his handphone, there was no reason why he could not spend one minute trying to ascertain who was on the bed.

127    Importantly, the Accused’s account was not consistent with what PW1 heard and saw. PW1 specifically heard the Accused calling out the victim’s name, indicating that the Accused knew who the person lying on the bed was. This evidence also corroborated that of the victim’s, who at some point in time heard someone asking her multiple times if she was okay. PW1 also gave evidence that she did not have the impression that the Accused was trying to push or move the victim’s body. She only saw the Accused moving, and she did not see the victim’s body move at all[\[note: 174\]](#Ftn_174). When PW1 later pretended to wake, she spoke to the Accused, who also acknowledged her by name.[^175] This was contradictory to his claim that he did not know who were the people in the bedroom.

128    I therefore found that the Accused’s claim that he was merely trying to find space on the bed to lie down, and that he did not know who was on the bed, not believable, and I rejected it accordingly. I was satisfied that the Accused must have known that the victim was lying on the bed closer to the door.

129    In fact, the Accused’s evidence that he did not know who was lying on the bed also did not sit well with his own account of an occasion in the course of the night when he had entered Bedroom 2 and saw PW1 and PW4 chatting. Interestingly, while the Accused could very clearly spell out the sequence of events for everything else, he could not place this occasion[\[note: 176\]](#Ftn_176). During this time, according to the Accused, the room lights were on, and there was already someone sleeping on the other bed from where PW1 and PW4 were. Yet incredibly, the Accused was still not able to make out who this person was as the person was “wrapped up”.[^177] I could not believe this. If the room lights were on, there was no reason why the Accused could not have seen who the person was, or at least to know if it was a male or female person. It was never put to PW1 or PW4 that they had been sitting in the room chatting at any point when someone other than the victim had been lying on the other bed. Therefore, if indeed the Accused had walked into the bedroom while the lights were on and when PW1 and PW4 were chatting, he would have known that the victim was lying in the other bed. This was again another instance of incompatibility within the Accused’s own evidence.

130    Further, this aspect of the Accused’s evidence was too contrived, and appeared to be an attempt on his part to try and explain the evidence from PW1 and PW4 that he had entered Bedroom 2 sometime after they tried to wake the victim, to try and chat with them.

131    The Accused’s evidence was therefore inherently problematic. In addition, it could also not be reconciled with the other evidence from PW1 and PW4. PW1 had heard the Accused call out the victim’s name in Bedroom 2, and had also engaged in a short conversation with him after she got up. According to PW4, he had seen the Accused enter Bedroom 2 almost immediately after he had left PW1 in the room with the victim. The Accused had also remained in the room for some time, thus further indicating that the Accused should have known by then who was in the room. I found the evidence from PW1 and P4 coherent and consistent and saw no reason not to rely on them. In contrast, the Accused’s account was too contrived and inconsistent, and I was unable to accept it.

### Evidence from DW2 and DW3 did not assist the Accused

132    According to DW2, when he went up to Bedroom 2 at about 2 or 2.25 a.m., he saw the Accused lying on the same bed as the victim, with PW1, PW4 and “TC” in the room as well. PW1 was telling the Accused to leave the room, and DW2 could see that “_the girls_” were feeling uncomfortable with the Accused’s presence so he also asked the Accused to leave. This could be consistent with the Accused’s account of having been woken up (after having dozed off for the second time on the bed) by DW2 calling out his name, and then leaving the room to go to the toilet. However, while DW2 mentioned that the Accused appeared drowsy when he left the room, it was not his evidence that the Accused was asleep. Furthermore, given the commotion that was going on with PW1 asking the Accused to leave and clearly uncomfortable with his presence, it was strange that the Accused would have just gotten up and left without ascertaining what was going on around him, and who was present.

133    On the other hand, DW2’s account was also consistent with the accounts from PW1 and PW4 regarding an occasion after they had tried but failed to wake up the victim, and they were sitting on the other bed talking when the Accused walked in to chat with them. PW4 also mentioned that during this time, the Accused lied down on the bed beside the victim, shocking both him and PW1. This incident was also found in one of PW4’s message to the victim on 18 December 2018 at 2.07:38 a.m.: “_Know about the refusing to leave and just lied down as well_.”[\[note: 178\]](#Ftn_178) According to PW4, it was soon after this that DW2 appeared and asked for the room to be cleared out. This was consistent with DW2’s evidence about the girls feeling uncomfortable with the Accused’s presence and wanting him to leave.

134    Weighing the evidence as a whole, I was inclined to the view that DW2’s evidence was in fact more in line with the evidence from PW1 and PW4. In particular, it was not his evidence that the Accused was asleep when he first saw him in the bed, only that the Accused was making the girls uncomfortable. I also note that DW2 could easily identify the persons in the room despite the room light not being switched on. This would seem to run counter to the Accused’s own case that he never managed to identify the persons in the room as it was too dark.

135    In the best case analysis for the Accused, the most that can be said about DW2’s evidence was that it was neutral. It certainly did not assist the Accused.

136    With regard to the evidence from DW3, I did not think this assisted the Accused as well. Her evidence was that she saw the Accused sitting on a chair in the living room area[\[note: 179\]](#Ftn_179) sometime after 1 a.m., when she had taken her personal belongings from Bedroom 2 and was preparing to leave. She spoke to him to inform him she was leaving, and then she left.

137    It would appear that DW3 left before PW1 saw the Accused in Bedroom 2, because she gave no evidence regarding having seen PW1 arrive on the ground floor in a state of panic. Therefore, her evidence would only appear to touch on events that occurred before any of the material incidents that night, and was therefore not very helpful.

138    Her evidence was also not able to directly contradict any of the evidence from the Prosecution witnesses, and in particular with regard to what happened after PW1 had been assisted to Bedroom 2. In the first place, her evidence that she had also helped to support PW1 up to Bedroom 2 was not corroborated by the evidence from PW1 or PW4, who did not remember her presence at that time. In any case, even if I accepted that she had indeed assisted PW1 up, according to her, she had gone to the toilet to change after that. At this point, PW4’s evidence was that he saw the Accused walk into Bedroom 2. DW3 would have been in the toilet then and not been able to see whether this happened.

139    Therefore, I found that DW3’s evidence did not assist the Accused as well.

### Issue of Accused’s attire

140    I should also deal with a minor point which came to my attention in the course of hearing the evidence, although this was not substantively raised by parties in their submissions. The victim’s evidence was that when she was pushing the left shoulder of the person who was assaulting her, it felt like her hand was on bare skin.[\[note: 180\]](#Ftn_180) She also mentioned that when she saw the Accused walk in later to talk to PW1 and PW4, he had a bare shoulder.[^181] However, this did not sit well with the rest of the evidence which seemed to indicate that by the time of the assault, the Accused had already changed out of his costume (where he had a bare shoulder[^182]) into a blue jersey shirt.

141    According to DW3, she had seen the Accused sleeping on a chair in the living room just before she left sometime past 1 a.m. This was reflected in the bottom photo of exhibit D2 page 50, and the photo showed that the Accused was already in his blue jersey shirt by then. I therefore accepted that by this time, the Accused would have changed out of his costume. In fact, according to PW4, by the time he first saw the Accused in Bedroom 2, immediately after he had left PW1 there, the Accused was already wearing a blue jersey.[\[note: 183\]](#Ftn_183)

142    The victim therefore appeared to be mistaken with regard to the Accused’s attire when he was assaulting her and when she saw him walking towards PW1 and PW4 (which according to the evidence from PW1 and PW4, would have taken place after the assault). I assessed this possible mistake on the victim’s part against the rest of the evidence, but took the view that this was not a fundamental error which detracted from the entirety of her other evidence, which remained sound and consistent. There could have been a minor lapse of memory on her part, or a conflation of her own identification of the Accused and her knowledge of what he was wearing at the party that night. Ultimately, I was still satisfied that the victim’s evidence identifying the Accused, coupled with the corroborative evidence from PW1, squarely placed the Accused as the perpetrator of the assault on the victim at the material time.

### Messages between PW4 and the victim post incident

143    There were a lot of allusions made in the course of trial by the Defence that PW4 and the victim were flirting with each other in their message conversations post incident, and the Defence also suggested in their closing submissions that PW4 was deliberately painting the Accused in a negative light to the victim and pushing her towards making the complaint against the Accused, so that PW4 could better win her heart. However, I did not find from the evidence or messages that PW4 had tried very hard to push the victim towards making the police report against the Accused, and he certainly did not appear to be a key factor in her ultimate decision to do so. Whether or not he had been flirting with the victim in his messages was, in my view, irrelevant. Even if he had been flirting with the victim, this did not mean that he was being untruthful in his evidence.

144    Ultimately, it was not put to PW4 that what he saw at the party was incorrect _i.e._ the Accused entering the bedroom after PW4 had brought PW1 there, the Accused trying to enter the Bedroom a few times that night, or the Accused entering Bedroom 2 and lying down on the same bed as the victim right in front of PW1 and PW4. I therefore did not think that PW4’s post incident behaviour detracted from the credibility of his evidence in any way.

### Victim’s evidence was “unusually convincing” on a totality of the evidence

145    In _Public Prosecutor v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”), the Court of Appeal explained at \[143\]-\[144\] that in the context of mutually exclusive and competing testimonies, the assessment of the Prosecution’s evidence under the “unusually convincing’ standard must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence, and this logically included the Defence’s case. In particular, in the context of the uncorroborated evidence of an eyewitness, whether his or her account was considered unusually convincing (and therefore capable of discharging the Prosecution’s burden of proving the case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt) required an assessment of the internal and external consistencies of the account, and other evidence that the court was bound to consider, such as a consideration of the Defence’s case.[^184]

146    In the present case, the victim and the Accused’s testimonies were mutually exclusive. The victim positively identified the Accused as the perpetrator who had grabbed her breast and kissed her forcefully. The Accused denied this, and instead offered the account that he had been merely trying to make space on the bed for himself. Any assessment of the evidence of the victim would therefore have to be done together with the evidence from the Accused in a comparative analysis.[\[note: 185\]](#Ftn_185)

147    Taken by itself, there were several aspects of the victim’s evidence which required closer examination (as set out at \[98\] – \[106\] above). I did not think these were weaknesses _per se_, as these were all still even the realm of reasonable possibilities. Nevertheless, it did give me pause in considering if the evidence amounted to being “unusually convincing” by itself.

148    However, the Prosecution’s case did not revolve solely around the victim’s evidence. There was evidence from PW1 and PW4, as well as extensive Whatsapp messages which corroborated the victim’s account, confirming both its internal as well as external consistency.

149    Furthermore, there was also the Accused’s account to consider. The account from the victim and other Prosecution witnesses had placed the Accused squarely in the thick of the action, detailing his movements and acts that night. An explanation was required from the Accused. However, and for the reasons as set out above, I found the explanation provided by the Accused to be incoherent and inconsistent, and sorely lacking in credibility. I note that there was no excuse for this, given the Accused’s own admission that he was not drunk on the night in question, was able to think rationally and recall the events of the night with some clarity. His failure to provide a credible version of events to what happened that night had the effect of solidifying the credibility of the victim’s account.

150    Weighing the evidence in its totality, I was of the view that the evidence from the Prosecution met the “unusually convincing” standard as set out in _GCK_, and I accepted that on 14 December 2018 at or about 1 a.m. in Bedroom 2, the Accused had forcefully kissed the victim on her mouth, and grabbed and squeezed her left breast with his hand, both over and under her clothes.

151    In order to establish the charge against the Accused, the Prosecution also needed to prove that the Accused had intended to outrage the modesty of the victim. Given that the Accused had deliberately and forcefully kissed and grabbed the victim’s breast, and the fact that he had failed to provide any reasonable explanation for his actions, the only inference that could be drawn from his actions is that he had intended to outrage the victim’s modesty.

### Conclusion (conviction)

152    I therefore found that the Prosecution had proven the charge against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt and convicted him accordingly.

## Sentencing

### Antecedents

153    The Accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s submission on sentence

154    The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 16 months’ imprisonment. As the Accused had turned 50 years old at the time of sentencing, he was not eligible to be caned, and the Prosecution also submitted for an additional term of two months’ imprisonment be imposed in lieu of caning, under s 352(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68).

155    In support of their submissions, the Prosecution relied on the sentencing framework set out in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”), and pointed out that the present case ought to fall within the lower end of Band 3, where a sentencing range of 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

156    In particular, the Prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     The degree of sexual exploitation was high, as the Accused had made skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s breast. The assault was also a sustained one, as according to the victim, it had lasted for about three to five minutes.

> (b)     The victim was vulnerable as she was in a state of intoxication and was sleeping at the material time.

> (c)     The Accused had exploited a situation in which the victim was entitled to feel safe as she was at an event with colleagues and was resting in a bedroom set aside for those who wanted to rest before returning home.

> (d)     The victim had suffered some psychological harm and found it difficult to trust others since the offence.

157    The Prosecution also relied on the following two sentencing precedents:

> (a)      _PP v Muhammad Fauzi bin Salleh_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 33</span> (MA 9021/2019), where the offender was convicted after trial on one charge of outraging the modesty of his ride-share passenger while she was sleeping. The offender had squeezed her left breast, grabbed her buttocks, touched her waist and legs and rubbed his penis against her face. This was done over the victim’s clothing, and lasted for under 58 minutes. The offender was sentenced to a term of 15 months’ imprisonment with three strokes of the cane.

> (b)      _PP v GCT_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 69</span> (MA 9318/2018), where the offender pleaded guilty on the first day of trial to a charge of outraging the modesty of a close friend at a chalet after a party. The victim was resting in a bedroom as she was tipsy. The offender then approached her and touched her breasts over her bra, touched her hip over her panties, rubbed her vagina with his finger and rubbed his penis between her bare buttocks. He was sentenced to a term of 15 months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.

158    In asking for an additional two months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning, the Prosecution relied on the same aggravating factors set out above to point to the need to compensate for the deterrent and retributive effect of caning lost by the exemption.

### Mitigation

159    Counsel for the Accused highlighted his personal background, including his financial and family difficulties in the last few years. Since the Accused was dismissed from the companyFebruary 2019, he had been working in the food delivery industry, dealing with long hours, low pay and dangerous working conditions. The Accused also suffered the loss of both his father and father-in-law in 2019 and 2021 respectively, and had to become the sole caregiver and financial provider for his mother during this time. In addition, the Accused had also been found to have a left deep lobe of parotid tumour, and was medically advised to have the tumour surgically excised in the near future.

160    Despite these difficulties, the Accused continued to volunteer his time with his church, and take part in community cycling activities.

161    In mitigation, counsel pointed out that the Accused had fully cooperated with the authorities and had no antecedents.

162    Referring to the sentencing framework set out in _Kunasekaran_, counsel submitted that the present case fell in the middle of Band 2. Although it involved skin-to-skin contact, there were no other offence specific aggravating factors that would elevate the Accused’s actions to Band 3. Counsel also highlighted that there was no evidence of any psychological or emotional harm suffered by the victim as a result of the incident.

163    Finally, counsel urged the court not to impose an imprisonment term in lieu of caning, as there were no substantial aggravating factors such as violence or exploitation of the victim in the present case, such that it was necessary to impose an imprisonment term in lieu to give effect to the sentencing objectives of deterrence and retribution.

### Court’s decision

164    The sentencing framework for offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code in _Kunasekaran_ at \[45\] to \[49\], is set out below for ease of reference:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="13.32%"><col width="56.56%"><col width="30.12%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than five months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases where two or more of the offence specific factors present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts, and also cases where there was use of deception.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Five to 15 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases where numerous offence specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

165    Some examples of offence specific factors are the degree of sexual exploitation, the circumstances of the offence (including considerations such as presence of premeditation, use of force or violence, abuse of a position of trust, use of deception, exploitation of a vulnerable victim, other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty) and the harm caused to the victim.[\[note: 186\]](#Ftn_186)

166    I found that the following aggravating factors were present in this case:

> (a)     The degree of sexual exploitation, while not the most severe, was nevertheless significant. The Accused had grabbed and squeezed the victim’s bare breast vigorously, and kissed her forcefully on the mouth. While it was unclear how long this assault lasted for, it was certainly not fleeting as the victim testified that it felt very long to her.

> (b)     There was some degree of premeditation and persistence on the part of the Accused. He was in the bedroom when PW1 was present, and had checked on the victim during that time. He also appeared to have done something inappropriate to the victim then. When he later realised that PW1 was awake, he stopped and later left. However, that did not deter him from returning to the bedroom after PW1 had left, in order to commit the present offence. This was not a spur of the moment act of impulse by the Accused.

> (c)     The Accused had exploited the victim’s vulnerability in being intoxicated and therefore not in a position to protect herself or to even know what was happening to her. The Accused clearly knew this, as he had checked on her condition earlier and saw that she was not able to respond properly.

> (d)     The victim suffered some harm as she came away from the incident having trust issues, and being afraid to drink alcohol now.

167    Bearing the above in mind, I was of the view that this case fell somewhere between the higher end of Band 2 and the lower end of Band 3. There was skin-to-skin intrusion on the victim’s private parts, as well as a number of aggravating factors. In particular, one of the aggravating factors involved the Accused exploiting the vulnerability of the victim as she was intoxicated and essentially non-functional. The fact that the Accused was someone the victim knew and trusted, made his behaviour all the more egregious.

168    Fifteen months imprisonment is the sentence at the cusp of Band 3 and I was of the view that this was an appropriate starting point. I note that this was also the sentence imposed in the two precedent cases cited by the Prosecution.

169    I found the precedent cases helpful as they had a similar factual matrix. I would, however, note the following distinctions.

> (a)     While the offender in _Muhammad Fauzi_ did not appear to have made skin-to-skin contact with the victim, the assault was more prolonged and involved the offender rubbing his penis on the victim’s face. In addition, there was a more egregious abuse of trust given that the offender was a Grab driver and the victim his passenger.

> (b)     The offender’s actions in _GCT_ were clearly more serious as it involved the intrusion of the victim’s vagina. However, he had pleaded guilty.

170    Having taken into account the sentencing framework set out in _Kunasekaran_, the aggravating factors in the present case as well as the sentencing precedents, I was of the view that a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment remained appropriate, and saw no reason to go beyond this term.

171    It was clear that the present factual matrix involving the intrusion of the victim’s private parts, would have ordinarily warranted the imposition of caning.[\[note: 187\]](#Ftn_187) As the Accused was now 50 years old, this was no longer possible, and the question was whether a term of imprisonment ought to be imposed in lieu of caning.

172    In considering this point, I had regard to the guidance from the High Court in _Amin bin Abdullah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 215</span> (“_Amin_”). The starting point is that a term of imprisonment should not be imposed unless there are grounds to do so. For example, where there are substantial aggravating factors such that there is a need for a sufficiently deterrent and retributive sentence.

173    I accepted that the dominant sentencing principles in the present case were that of deterrence and retribution. The strong public interest in deterring such sexual assault offences cannot be gainsaid, especially in such opportunistic situations involving social gatherings and alcohol consumption with friends and colleagues. In addition, retribution is a relevant factor given that the offence was committed against a specific victim.[\[note: 188\]](#Ftn_188)

174    That said, it was not apparent to me that an additional term of imprisonment was required to replace the lost effect of deterrence or retribution. I note that the Accused just turned 50 years old last October and it would be too much of a stretch to say that he would have known, when he committed the offence in 2018, that he would be exempted from caning.[\[note: 189\]](#Ftn_189) In addition, while the victim was in a vulnerable state due to her intoxication, she did not fall within a “particularly vulnerable class of victims”[^190]. There was also not such a serious abuse of trust in the present case as to trigger the need to reflect the retributive element in an additional term of imprisonment, unlike the case in _PP v Tan Kok Leong and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 188</span>, involving a medical professional and his patient.

175    I therefore declined to impose an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning.

### Conclusion (sentence)

176    The total sentence imposed on the Accused was therefore a term of 15 months’ imprisonment. I was of the view that such a sentence was sufficient and appropriate to meet the sentencing objectives of deterrence and retribution.
