### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

The police raided a flat for suspected vice activities and found a group of women therein, including the accused, a 32-year old female Chinese national. She was uncooperative and resisted arrest. She tried to kick one of the officers and also attempted to bite another officer. She managed to bite a third officer before she was finally arrested. She was charged and pleaded guilty to a charge under s 332 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) for causing hurt to the said police officer and was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment. She is appealing against the said imprisonment sentence which she is serving at the time of writing these grounds.

## Charge and Sentence

2       I set out the charge against the accused for easy reference:

> You…are charged that you, on 28 August 2018, at or about 2.45 a.m., at Block 356B Admiralty Drive #XXX, Sun Bliss, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one SC/Sergeant Tan Jun Hong, a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant, to wit, by biting his right forearm with intent to prevent the said SC/Sergeant Tan Jun Hong from discharging his duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Statement of Facts

3       The accused admitted to the statement of facts (“SOF”) presented by the prosecution without qualification. The SOF is set out in its entirety as follows:

> 1.    The accused is He Yan, a 32-year old female Chinese national and holder of FIN: XXX (date of birth: 13 April 1987). She was in Singapore on a work permit and resided at Block 356B Admiralty Drive #XXX, Sun Bliss, Singapore (“the Flat”).

> 2.    The victim is Tan Jun Hong, a 20 year old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was a police officer (national service) attached to Sembawang NPC and held the rank of SC/Sergeant.

> 3.    The witnesses are:

>> a.    Reagan Heng Loong Jin, a 28 year old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was a police officer attached to Ang Mo Kio Division Crime Control Unit and held the rank of Sergeant (2) (“Sgt Heng”).

>> b.    Hoe Zulin Jocelyn, a 25 year old female Singaporean. At the material time, she was a police officer attached to Ang Mo Kio Division Crime Control Unit and held the rank of Sergeant (2) (“Sgt Hoe”).

> FACTS RELATING TO THE CHARGE

> 4.    On 28 August 2018 at about 1.05 a.m., a party of police officers consisting of the victim and the witnesses proceeded to the Flat to investigate into a complaint concerning vice activities. Upon reaching the Flat, the police officers found the accused and some other women. After interviewing them, the police officers placed the accused and the other women under arrest on suspicion of having engaged in vice activities.

> 5.    Sgt Hoe and Sgt Heng informed the accused that she would be brought back to the police station and asked her to pack her belongings. The accused was reluctant. As such, Sgt Hoe and Sgt Heng decided to place handcuffs on the accused and approached her. The accused remained uncooperative. She lay down on a bed with her arms and legs flailing and tried to kick Sgt Hoe away in order to resist arrest. Sgt Heng then held her left arm to the bed while another police officer held her right arm.

> 6.    Gradually, Sgt Heng propped the accused up into a sitting position and tried to bend her left arm to her back in order to handcuff her. The accused tried to bite Sgt Heng’s left arm but Sgt Heng moved his arm out of the way.

> 7.    At this juncture, **the victim came to assist Sgt Heng in arresting the accused and tried to stop the accused from struggling. He placed his right hand on the accused’s shoulder. The accused then turned her head towards her left and bit the victim’s right forearm. The victim pulled his hand away immediately.** The accused was subsequently handcuffed and brought back to Ang Mo Kio Divisional Headquarters.

> 8.    The victim was subsequently seen at the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on the same day by Dr. Hiew Shen Yong. He was found to have suffered a superficial bite mark on his right forearm. He was given a tetanus toxoid vaccination and had his wound dressed. He was given 1 day of medical leave.

> 9.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused did voluntarily cause hurt to the victim, a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant, by biting his right forearm with intent to prevent the victim from discharging his duty as such public servant. She has thus committed an offence punishable under section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and is charged accordingly.

(emphasis added)

## Antecedents

4       The accused, being a foreign national, has no known criminal antecedents in Singapore.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

5       The learned DPP tendered a list of sentencing precedents and submitted for an imprisonment sentence of at least six months.

## Mitigation

6       The accused was in person. In mitigation, she said that she came from China. She also claimed that she was robbed and raped. She did not elaborate any further. She said she was in a bad mood and had a few drinks when the police entered her place. She was emotionally unstable and resisted when the police tried to subdue her. She regretted her actions and pleaded for leniency.

## Reasons for Sentence

#### Prescribed punishment

7       The charge under s 332 of the Penal Code offence is punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, or with a fine, or with caning, or with a combination of such punishments.

#### Sentencing framework and principles

8       I considered the public interest to protect police officers from all forms of assault and abuse in the course of carrying out their duties. The said public interest was recently re-affirmed by the High Court of three Judges in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”) where the court stated at \[50\] in no uncertain terms that police officers had to be assured of adequate protection and vindication by the law against behaviour that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties. The High Court noted a sentencing trend which showed that for any assault against a police or law enforcement officer, a custodial sentence was the norm and the usual sentence would be around two to nine months’ imprisonment.[^1] The court went on to formulate a sentencing framework for a s 332 Penal Code offence so as to reflect society’s opprobrium of offences against police officers.[^2] Under the framework, the lowest category (i.e. Category 1) is stated to encompass the existing sentencing norm of a custodial sentence of two to nine months’ imprisonment, which would remain the indicative starting point. The present offence would fall under this category.

9       The applicable and dominant sentencing consideration for the present case must be one of general deterrence. In addition, I considered the specific nature of the assault by the accused and the injury caused. The accused bit the officer and left a mark on the officer’s forearm. He had to seek medical treatment and was given a tetanus vaccination and also medical leave for one day. I was therefore of the view that the principle of retribution was also applicable to a certain degree in view of the vicious and atavistic nature of the assault on the unsuspecting officer.

#### Aggravating circumstances

10     On the present facts, I further considered that the accused’s aggression was not confined to only one officer. She was in fact violent and resisted arrest by trying to kick at another officer and then tried to bite a second officer. Her behaviour was plainly disdainful and contemptuous of police authority and should be adequately punished. These were additional circumstances that aggravated her culpability.

#### Sentencing precedents

11     The prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least six months’ imprisonment. The learned DPP tendered a table listing out 21 sentencing precedents in support of prosecution’s sentencing position.[^3] These precedents were all decided post-_Jeffrey Yeo_ and they all involve an offence under s 332 of the Penal Code for biting a police officer. I noted that the sentence imposed for a similar offence of biting a police officer in 17 of the 21 cases was between 5-18 months’ imprisonment, with 11 of the cases (i.e. more than half of the cases) having a sentence of between 5-6 months’ imprisonment for the said offence. In three of the remaining four cases, the sentence imposed was four months’ imprisonment which was not very much less than the norm of 5-6 months. The outlier was a case[^4] where the offender, who had a mild intellectual disability, was given a more lenient sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment.

12     The facts in relation to these precedents were typical i.e. the offender would resist arrest by inter alia biting the police officer. By way of example and reference, I refer to the facts of one such precedent in _PP v Ang See Seng_ (“_Ang See Seng_”)[^5]. Police officers raided the home of a 34-year old male offender and found drugs and drug paraphernalia. The offender tried to leave the room and was arrested when he became aggressive. He struggled violently and bit one of the officers’ right forearm. The officer suffered a contusion with abrasions. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment which was upheld on appeal.

13     Having regard to the precedents, the prosecution’s submission for a 6- month jail sentence in the present case is entirely reasonable, justified and fell within the normal range of sentences which has been imposed by the courts for such an offence. In _Ang See Seng_, the sentence of six month’s imprisonment was upheld on appeal[^6]. However, I note that the offender in that case has an antecedent in 2000 as a juvenile for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt and again in 2011 but that was taken into consideration.[^7] In the present case, I considered that the accused is a first offender, at least for purposes of the present proceedings in Singapore. Therefore, I decided that a starting sentence of five months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

#### No compelling mitigating factors

14     Apart from the fact that the accused pleaded guilty and is a first offender, I did not view any of the circumstances that she stated in her mitigation to be so exceptional as to justify a significant reduction from the indicative range of 5-6 months’ imprisonment. A fine would certainly have been out of the question. It was held in _Jeffrey Yeo_ that fines should generally be available _only_ to young offenders or offenders with some mental disorder. Neither of these two traits apply to the present accused. In fact, she admitted that she had a few drinks. That would probably explain (but not excuse or mitigate) her uncooperative and aggressive behaviour. As to her claim that she was robbed and raped, she did not provide any details. It did not appear that she had even reported her claims to the police. The prosecution also did not throw any light on her claims. In any case, the accused did not explain how her claims had any bearing on the present charge.

## Conclusion

15     In conclusion, the principle of general deterrence, underpinned by the public interest to protect police officers in the discharge of their public functions, is applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case. The principle of retribution was also relevant to a lesser degree. These sentencing principles outweigh the personal circumstances of the accused. In addition, the precedents show that a custodial sentence between 5-6 months is generally the usual sentence for biting a police officer in the course of resisting arrest. There are no exceptional mitigating factors or circumstances in this case to justify a departure from this norm.

16     For all the reasons set out above, the accused is sentenced to five months’ imprisonment.
