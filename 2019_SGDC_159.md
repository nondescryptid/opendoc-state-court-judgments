\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9166/2019/01.\]

29 July 2019

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charge

1       The accused, _Ms Mithileswariy d/o Aruvalangan_, a 26-year old female Singaporean, had pleaded guilty on _1 July 2019_ to one charge of attempted drug possession under s 8(a) read with s 12 and punishable under s 33(1) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) in **DAC 900789-2019**. She was sentenced to _eight months’_ imprisonment and her sentence was backdated to _10 January 2019_, the date she was first produced in Court 26.

2       In view of the time she had spent in remand and the remission period as calculated by the prison authorities, she was released on _1 July 2019_ itself. This is her appeal against sentence filed on _15 July 2019_ through her CLAS Advocate, Ms Sadhana Rai who had represented her when she pleaded guilty in the first instance. The proceeded charge against her is as follows:

> _Exhibit C1C –_ **_1st charge (Amended)_**

> “…that you, 12 September 2018, at or about 4.47 p.m. at the level 3 staircase of Block 211 Yishun Street 21, Singapore 760211, did attempt to have in your possession (1) packet containing not less 1.00 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.67 gram of Methamphetamine, which is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, by travelling to the aforesaid location so as to collect the said amount of Methamphetamine pursuant to a request of one Gopinathan s/o Vithilingam without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(a) read with Section 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and punishable under Section 33(1) of the aforesaid Act.

## B.   Statement of Facts

3       The Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) prepared by the Prosecution which the accused had admitted to without qualification is as follows:

> “The accused is Mithileswariy d/o Aruvalangan, female/26 years old (Date of Birth:31 July 1992), a Singaporean.

> 2.    The co-accused is Muhammad Hilal Bin Shaik Ismail, male/26 years old (Date of Birth: 31 December 1992), a Singaporean (“Md Hilal”).

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC 900789-2019 ATTEMPTED POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DRUG**

> 3.    On 11 September 2018 at about 6.33 p.m., Md Hilal was arrested at his home, Block 211 Yishun Street 21, #XXX, Singapore, by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) for drug related offences. A search was conducted and the under-listed exhibit, which was believed to be a ‘ice’ (a street name for Methamphetamine), was seized from Md Hilal’s possession:

>> a.    1 packet containing crystalline substance (later marked as exhibit “F”).

> 4.    Investigations revealed that the accused and Md Hilal are acquainted and they were in communication on 11 September 2018, sometime before Md Hilal’s arrest. During the communication, the accused requested Md Hilal to supply her with “1G of ‘ice’ (a street name for Methamphetamine) at a price of $100. Md Hilal agreed and in pursuant, he prepared the accused’s request and it was packed in the exhibit “F”.

> 5.    It was arranged that the accused was to collect the ‘ice’ at the void deck of Block 211 Yishun Street 21 (“the location”) on the following day. Subsequently, on 12 September 2018 at about 4.47 p.m., the accused was arrested at level 3 staircase of Apt Block 211 Yishun Street 21 by CNB officers.

> 6.    Meanwhile, on 12 September 2018, the exhibit “F” was sealed in a separate tamperproof bag and submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

> 7.    On 22 October 2018, Tang Shi Ying Angeline an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of HSA, having had conduct of the analysis in relation to the exhibit ‘F”, issued a certificate bearing Lab No: ID-1832-02177-001, under Section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). It stated that exhibit “F” was found to be 1 packet containing not less than 1.00 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain **not less than 0.67 gram of Methamphetamine.**

> 8.     **Methamphetamine** is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

> 9.    Investigations further revealed that at the time of her arrest, the accused was attempting to have in her possession the aforesaid controlled drug, _to wit_, by travelling to the location so as to collect the aforesaid controlled drug. The accused had made the order from Md Hilal, on the request of one Gopinathan s/o Vithilingam, who is her acquaintance, and she was supposed to pass the aforesaid controlled drug to Gopinathan s/o Vithilingam after collecting it from Md Hilal.

> 10.    It was also revealed that the accused had previously procured and collected ‘ice’ on two previous occasions from Md Hilal and this would thus, be her third order of ‘ice’ from Md Hilal. The accused had made all the three orders on the request of Gopinathan s/o Vithilingam.

> 11.    The accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to have in her possession the said controlled drug, and by the foregoing, she has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(_a_) read with Section 12 of the MDA, and punishable under Section 33(1) of the aforesaid Act.

> 12.    The accused stands charged accordingly

## C.   Antecedents

4       The Accused has no prior antecedents.

## D.   Prosecution’s Address On Sentence

5       In its oral address on sentence, the Prosecution had highlighted that the accused has been convicted on a charge of attempted drug possession. It was submitted that s 12 Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) prescribes the offence to be the same as that for possession of drugs unlike s 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.). The Prosecution made reference to the Court of Appeal decision in _PP v Mas Swan Bin Adnan and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 29</span> at \[59\] and highlighted that the substantive offence in the present case was possession.

6       It was further submitted that in the present case there was a complete lack of exceptional circumstances but rather there were two aggravating factors as stated in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Facts. This would be a third order of ‘ice’ from Muhammad Hilal and all these orders were on the request of Gopinathan s/o Vithilingam. It was highlighted that the drugs were not meant for her own consumption. It was the case for the Prosecution that it was meant to be distributed or delivered to Gopinathan and she was in effect spreading the scourge of drugs. This could not be regarded as a mitigating factor.

7       In response to the accused’s written mitigation that the accused has no prior antecedents, the Prosecution had referred to _PP v Lim Cheng Ji, Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 183</span>. In that case the High Court at \[20\] had held that:

> “Turning to the second of the main planks underpinning the District Judge’s decision, as I have summarised at \[5\] above, it is true that the Respondent had no antecedents in the sense that he had not previously been charged.But where, as here, the offender has previously engaged in criminal conduct, even if he has not been charged, then although such conduct should not be considered as an aggravating factor, the lack of a court antecedent certainly cannot be regarded as mitigating: see _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> at \[62\] and \[81\]…”

It was submitted that the accused being untraced could not be regarded as a mitigating factor. It was the case for the Prosecution that in the present case, there were no reasons to depart from usual sentence i.e. 8 to 12 months’ imprisonment.

## E.   Mitigation

8       The Defence had asked the Court to consider the imposition of probation in light of the accused’s good prospects of rehabilitation which places this sentencing objective at the forefront. In the alternative, it was submitted that should the Court wish to consider imposing a custodial sentence, it was suggested that a term of five months’ imprisonment be imposed on the accused.

9       In essence, it was submitted that the accused, a 26-year old female was admitted to Nanyang Polytechnic and was pursuing a course in Aerospace Engineering prior to her arrest. She lives with her family which consisted of her parents, her brother and herself. Throughout her years in school, the accused had juggled her academic responsibilities with a night-shift job at a warehouse. At the time of her arrest, the accused had just started a new job with Singapore Technology(“ST”) Marine at Keppel Shipyard.

10     According to her Counsel, the accused had no prior antecedents and she neither consumed drugs recreationally or casually. Her family members did not have a history of drug usage and this was attributed to the strict upbringing by her parents.

11     It was the case for the Defence that Gopinathan s/o Vithilingam is a childhood friend of both the accused and her brother. The accused met him around 14 to 15 years ago while she was in secondary school and consequently, he became like an elder brother to the accused.

12     It was submitted that at the time of her arrest, the accused was stunned and frightened beyond measure as she had never been in trouble with the law before. It was further submitted that the accused’s urine test conducted when she was arrested did not show any traces of drug consumption further evidencing her general non-involvement in the drug scene.

## Probation should be called because she is not a typical offender

13     It was the case for the Defence that even though the accused is not a young offender (in the sense that she is above 21), it does not rule out the possibility of probation where the rehabilitative potential is high. Her Counsel referred to the High Court decision in _PP v Lim Chee Yin Gordon_ \[2018\] 1 SLR 1294 where the court had considered whether adult offenders who were above 21 years old could be sentenced to probation. It was submitted in that case, the appellate court had found that the respondent’s factual circumstances and personal factors did not provide firm evidence of his strong propensity for reform. Her Counsel then went on to highlight several cases involving young offenders below the age of 21 who had committed serious crimes.

14     It was submitted that the following factors as summarised in _Leon Russel Francis v PP_ \[2014\] 4 SLR 65 have been cited by the courts to determine whether the offender’s chances of rehabilitation are demonstrably high such that probation would be appropriate:

> a.     The strength of the offender’s familial support and the degree of supervision provided by the offender’s family for his or her rehabilitation;

> b.     The frequency and intensity of the offender’s drug related activities;

> c.     The genuineness of remorse demonstrated by the offender; and

> d.     The presence of risk factors such as negative peers or bad habits.

15     It was the case for the Defence that there were several factors showing why the accused has a demonstrably high capacity for reform:

> a.     She is a first-time offender;

> b.     She is motivated at school as from her ITE education she enrolled in a full time diploma course in Nanyang Polytechnic since 2018 and had also taken on a job to supplement her experience. It was argued that her youth and strong family support are strong indicators of her rehabilitative potential. It was argued that her rehabilitation would be achieved with a probation order without blemishing her future;

> c.     She has strong family support as her parents have been strict and extremely involved in her upbringing. It was argued that crucially they have kept her on the right side of the law for her whole life;

> d.     There was no question of the frequency or intensity of her drug related activities because she was clearly not involved in the drug scene the way other offenders are. According to her Counsel she does not consume drugs, nor does she buy them for herself;

> e.     She does not display any risk factor warranting the displacement of rehabilitation as a sentencing consideration. It was submitted that the only negative influence in her life was Gopi who she had cut off all ties with evidencing her ability to disassociate on her own.

## In the alternative, an imprisonment term of five months would adequately reflect her culpability

16     It was submitted that it is well recognized that the sentencing range for a first time drug possession offender is 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment: _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh_ \[2005\] 3 SLR (R)1 (“_Dinesh Singh Bhatia”_) at \[38\]. It was highlighted that the offender in that case was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment as the consumption was a one-off episode.

17     It was further submitted that similar sentences have been meted out in recent cases involving the consumption of methamphetamine: see _PP v Nantipa Dokmai_ \[2018\] 301 and _PP v Sutherland Hugh David Brodie_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 49</span>. It was highlighted that in the Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (3rd Edition, Volume II at page 1177) it is acknowledged that the cases after _Dinesh Singh Bhatia_ had also followed the range of 6 to 18 months for first time drug possession cases_._

18     It was the case for the Defence that despite the sentencing framework for drug offenders, the High Court in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia_ at \[24\] held that sentencing precedents and tariffs should not be blindly adhered to specifically in cases where it calls for individualized justice.

19     It was submitted that the accused’s case is _atypical_ of offenders who have the intention to possess and consume drugs due to addiction. According to her Counsel, she did not actively seek the drugs to feed her addiction. It was further submitted that she has never consumed the drugs before and did not do this for her own profit or consumption. It was the case for the Defence that she was misled by someone she considered an elder brother.

20     It was submitted that the surrounding facts suggest that her offending is one-off, unintentional and that she is an individual with low propensity to reoffend. It was further submitted that the sentence should not only tailor to the crime but to the criminal as well. Her Counsel referred to sentencing precedents where first time offenders had received sentences in the range of 5 to 8 months for drug related offences. She had also referred to a case ie. _PP v Nora Binte Sudin_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 223</span> where an offender who had a previous DRC admission was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment for drug consumption.

21     It was the case for the Defence that the real issue before the Court was whether a high sentence was necessary to deter the accused from reoffending and is this a case which should form part of the body of cases intended to signal the State’s tough stance on drugs. It was submitted that the accused was not a hardcore or frequent drug user. It was also submitted that she was not steeped in drug-related lifestyle. It was orally highlighted that if the sentence was backdated, there was no material effect except that the record shows she has either had five months or eight months’ imprisonment as she had been remanded since January 2019. She was foolish in her actions and is committed not to reoffend. According to Counsel, she looked forward to resuming her life. It was further submitted that her biggest regret was that this would affect her job opportunities, which at her young age could be severely detrimental for her prospects. Her Counsel asked for leniency in sentencing in light of the factors raised above.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

22     In response to the plea in mitigation, it was submitted that touching on circumstances of the offence proper, Counsel had pointed out ad nauseam that the drugs was not meant for accused's consumption and it was meant to be passed on to Gopinathan. She has gone on to expound on how it should be seen in a positive light. On the contrary, it was the Prosecution’s case that the accused’s act was actually spreading or extending the harmful effects of the drug scourge to another individual. She was not confining the harmful effects of drugs to herself.

23     It was further submitted that Counsel had failed to at least show some light on why the accused had agreed to carry out the task as requested by Gopinathan. The fact that the accused has done it on three occasions was glossed over by the Defence.

24     It was submitted that in respect of Counsel’s submissions for probation, she had cited a litany of factors which may merit the calling for a suitability report. Counsel had cited cases for probation but the charges or offences were completely different from the instant case. It was reiterated the relevant authority was _PP v Lim Cheng Ji, Alvin_ at \[7\], a 2017 case.

25     It was highlighted that the accused in _PP v Lim Cheng Ji, Alvin_ was 17 years old and for _PP v Wong Jiayi_, the accused was 20 years of age. These cases can be distinguished from the present case where accused is 27 years old, worldly-wise and has not done it for the first time. It was submitted that the rest of the precedents were unreported cases of which the Prosecution would not be privy to the uniqueness or peculiarity of the case for it to be used as the guidance of precedence. In the circumstances, it was submitted that there were no exceptional circumstances in the present case but rather two aggravating factors namely that this was her third time. The accused extending the harm of the drug scourge to someone else was an aggravating factor. It was submitted that there was absolutey no grounds to depart from the usual sentence of 8 to 12 months’ imprisonment.

## G.   The Sentence

#### Prescribed punishments for attempted possession of drugs

26     The prescribed punishment for an offence of attempted drug possession under s 8(a) read with s 12 and punishable under s 33(1) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.) is a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years or to a fine of up to $20,000 or to both.

27     In the present case, the Prosecution had sought the usual benchmark sentence of between 8 to 12 months’ imprisonment. In contrast, even though she was above 21 years of age, her Counsel had urged the Court to consider the imposition of a probation order in light of the accused’s good prospects of rehabilitation which places this sentencing objective at the forefront. In the alternative, it was submitted that should the Court wish to consider imposing a custodial sentence, it was suggested that a term of five months’ imprisonment be imposed on the accused.

28     As highlighted by the Prosecution in their address on sentence, I was mindful that the High Court in _PP v Lim Cheng Ji, Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 183</span> at \[7\] had made it it clear that particularly in the context of drug offences, deterrence is the dominant consideration. Unless it was an exceptional case, a custodial term is usually imposed. As a general rule, probation is inappropriate for serious offences or where violence has been committed. In the present case, the offence committed by the accused is considered to be serious offence as it is a drug-related offence. It is clear from case law that the probation is the exception rather than the norm for adult offenders of drug offences.

29     In the present case, it was undisputed that the accused was not a young offender below the age of 21 years but was already a 26 year-old adult, doing a diploma in Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Polytechnic while working at ST Marine when the offence was committed. Hence, the sentencing framework for young offenders is not applicable in the present case. Rehabilitation can be an operative concern of an offender above the age of 21, only if he or she demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation as set out by the High Court in _Goh Lee Yin_ \[2006\]1 SLR(R) 530 at \[28\].

30     This was not the case for the accused person as there is no evidence that she was labouring under any serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder which had a causal link to the commission of the offences. Under these circumstance I was unable to accept the Defence’s contention that probation be imposed in light of the accused’s good prospects of rehabilitation which places this sentencing objective at the forefront. In my view, as she was not a young offender and there were no exceptional circumstances in the present case, rehabilitation was no longer the main sentencing consideration in this case.

31     Furthermore, there were aggravating factors as reflected in the Statement of Facts for this case which weighed clearly in favour of deterrence. As highlighted by the Prosecution, this was her third order of ‘ice’, a Class A drug from Muhammad Hilal and all these orders were on the request of Gopinathan s/o Vithilingam. Although the drugs were not meant for her own consumption, it was meant to be distributed or delivered to Gopinathan. Hence, I did not accept Counsel’s submissions that the surrounding facts suggest that the accused’s offending was one-off, unintentional and that she is an individual with low propensity to reoffend.

32     After a careful consideration of the above factors, in view of the dominant sentencing principle of general deterrence, the aggravating factors highlighted above, as well as the mitigating factors, I was of the view that a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment for **DAC 900789-2019** would be just and approporiate in the present case.

33     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against her sentences on 15 July 2019. In view of her period of remand and the remission period, the accused had served her sentence and was released on 1 July 2019 itself.
