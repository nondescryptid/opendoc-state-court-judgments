### District Judge Jonathan Toh Jun Hian:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Australia and the defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore. They are both in the business of trading in wines and spirits.

2       The plaintiff claimed that the defendant purchased 840 cases of Johnny Walker Black whisky and 368 cases of Chivas Regal whisky (the “Goods”) and instructed the plaintiff to ship them to the defendant’s nominated consignee, Fuzhou Sha Lun Trade Co., Ltd (“FZSL”), in Tianjin, China. The plaintiff duly shipped the Goods to FZSL and invoiced the defendant. The defendant failed to pay, and the plaintiff sued for the purchase price of USD 154,704.

3       The issues arise from the defendant’s arguments on why it was not liable to pay the contract price.

4       First, the defendant alleged that there was no binding contract between the parties because there was no proper offer made. This was because the plaintiff only sent a draft quotation, a pro forma invoice, and a draft bill of lading to the defendant, but none of these documents were final.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

5       Second, even if there was a proper offer, the defendant alleged that it did not accept the plaintiff’s offer because it did not pay the deposit, which was a condition precedent to contract formation.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

6       Third, the defendant’s alternative position was that even if there was a binding contract between the parties, the defendant was not obliged to pay the purchase price because the plaintiff did not present an original bill of lading for payment.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

7       In response, the plaintiff argued that there was a binding contract but no requirement for the presentation of an original bill of lading against payment.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) Alternatively, even if there was a requirement, the defendant had waived it or is estopped from alleging that there was such a requirement.[^5]

8       Fourth, the defendant argued that it was not obliged to pay as title and risk in the Goods never passed to it.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

9       Fifth, the defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to prove that the goods were delivered.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

10     Sixth, the defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to mitigate its loss.

11     On 16 June 2022, I granted judgment to the plaintiff for payment of 20% of the purchase price and dismissed its claim for the remaining 80%. In brief, I found that:

> (a)     There was a binding contract between the parties for the sale and purchase of the Goods.

> (b)     The express terms of the contract required payment of (i) a deposit of 20% of the purchase price; and (ii) the balance 80% of the purchase price against the presentation of an original bill of lading for the Goods.

> (c)     The original bill of lading was never presented for payment and the defendant did not waive the requirement for an original bill of lading. As such, while the Goods were shipped to Tianjin and released to the defendant’s nominated consignee, FZSL, the defendant’s obligation to pay the remainder 80% of the purchase price was not triggered.

12     Both parties filed their respective appeals and I now set out my full grounds of decision.

## The Facts

13     The negotiations on the sale and purchase of the Goods took place primarily between the plaintiff’s Mr Menno Bastiaan Willem Burkunk (“Mr Menno”) and the defendant’s Mr Lee Lai Rong Daniel (“Mr Lee”) through an exchange of WhatsApp messages. Both parties relied on the transcript of the exchange of WhatsApp messages between Mr Menno, Mr Lee and the plaintiff’s Mr John Van.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) A separate transcript of WhatsApp messages between Mr Menno and Mr Lee was also available.[^9] The parties’ representatives also exchanged a number of emails. Mr Menno gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff and Mr Lee gave evidence on behalf of the defendant. It was not disputed that Mr Menno and Mr Lee were duly authorised to act on behalf of the respective parties in the transaction.

14     Prior to 18 June 2018, the plaintiff shipped the Goods from Melbourne to Singapore. On 18 June 2018, while the Goods were in transit, the plaintiff’s Mr Menno asked the defendant’s Mr Lee on WhatsApp where he would like to divert the goods to:[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

15     Inherent in Mr Menno’s request for Mr Lee’s directions on where to direct the Goods was the assumption that the defendant was purchasing the Goods.

16     Mr Lee did not respond and parties corresponded about other matters until 20 June 2018 when Mr Menno asked again. On 20 and 21 June 2018, Mr Lee instructed Mr Menno to send the Goods to Tianjin.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

17     The plaintiff engaged JF Hillebrand Singapore Pte Ltd (“JF Hillebrand”) to ship the Goods to Tianjin. Mr Jorge Francisco Lara Rojas (“Mr Jorge”), JF Hillebrand’s business unit manager, gave evidence on the shipping of the Goods. He presented a booking confirmation dated 29 June 2018 ordering the Goods to be shipped to Tianjin on the vessel “Xin Chang Shu” with the estimated time of arrival of 7 August 2018.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

18     On 3 July 2018, the plaintiff sent a draft quotation for the Goods to the Defendant by WhatsApp[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) and email[^14] (the “Draft Quotation”). The next day, on 4 July 2018, Mr Menno sent a further WhatsApp message informing Mr Lee that while the deposit was “officially” required, Mr Menno appreciated that Mr Lee kept his word and therefore it was fine for the purchase price to be paid together a week before the Goods arrived.[^15]

19     On 4 July 2018 at 12.36 pm, the defendant’s Ms Doreen Goh sent an email to the plaintiff to name “Fuzhou All Yucheng Import & Export Trade Co. , Ltd” as the consignee. Shortly thereafter, at 12.55 pm, she sent a further email naming FZSL as the consignee instead.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

20     On 13 July 2018, the plaintiff sent a pro forma invoice for the Goods by email (the “**Pro Forma Invoice**”).[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) A draft bill of lading dated 21 July 2018 was prepared.[^18]

21     On 24 July 2018, Mr Menno asked Mr Lee for payment over WhatsApp.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) He asked again on 30 July 2018.[^20]

22     On 1 August 2018 at 1.37 pm, Mr Lee asked for the bill of lading over WhatsApp.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) At 10.14 pm, Mr Menno forwarded an email to him with the draft bill of lading (the “Draft BL”), packing list, and the Pro Forma Invoice.[^22] The Draft BL[^23] was not the draft of an original bill of lading. It was expressly stated to be “a non-negotiable, electronic copy bill of lading for information purposes only, without contractual or legal value.” It also stated “telex release (BL surrender at S’pore)”. Mr Jorge called this a draft of an “express bill of lading” and explained that if the consignee produced a copy of an endorsed express bill of lading with an endorsed telex release confirming that the consignee was assuming responsibility for the Goods, the Goods would be released to the consignee.[^24] On the terms of this draft bill of lading, there was no need for the presentation of an original bill of lading to obtain release of the Goods.

23     Thereafter, parties entered into a series of correspondence where the plaintiff demanded that the defendant pay for the Goods and the defendant assured the plaintiff that it would be responsible for and take the Goods.

> (a)     On 3, 6 and 7 August 2018, Mr Menno chased Mr Lee for payment over WhatsApp.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) At the same time, the plaintiff’s Mr John Van sent email chasers on 6 and 7 August 2018 for payment.[^26]

> (b)     In his email of 7 August 2018, Mr Van stated that if the defendant did not settle the invoice, he would be “forced to make alternative arrangements”.

> (c)     Mr Lee responded by email dated 8 August 2018 stating “Dear John, I assured that this will be settled. There’s no need to look for alternative… But give me a couple of days, since I promise to take it. I will take it.”[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

> (d)     By an email dated 13 August 2018, Mr Van responded to state “Will noted. Please kindly send through remittance, as there is only limited free at Port as advised by the line…”.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) By a further email dated 16 August 2018, Mr Lee replied: “Hi John, Will get that done. Give me a couple of day. I’m clearing some other JW at the time being. Sorry for this mess. The market just go bad. But we will take responsible for any container sent to us.”[^29]

> (e)     On 27 to 28 Aug 2018, when Mr Menno demanded again for payment over WhatsApp, Mr Lee responded “I’m trying”.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

> (f)     On 12 October 2018, Mr Menno chased again for payment by a private WhatsApp message to Mr Lee, asking “Daniel any news on the first payment?\\”.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) On 16 October 2018, on the group WhatsApp chat, Mr Lee sent a message stating “i’ll update you around 2pm today. sorry for the delay. but all seem good now”. Mr Lee then sent a further private WhatsApp message to Mr Menno on 17 October 2018 stating “hi menno, end of today i’ll update u. i have make some payment out of china. recently everything is slow. i dun want to give u empty promise. once the fund is in place these 2 days. i’ll update you”.

24     JF Hillebrand’s records showed that the Goods were shipped to Tianjin and released to FZSL upon the presentation of a copy of the express bill of lading endorsed by FZSL, and a blank telex release form also endorsed by FZSL.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) An email from one Audrey Joly of JF Hillebrand stated that the container was collected by the consignee, FZSL, on 21 August 2018 and returned on 24 August 2018.[^33]

## Was there a binding contract formed between the parties?

25     The Defendant argued that there was no valid offer because the Draft Quotation, Pro Forma Invoice, and Draft BL were all draft documents. However, it cited no case authority for the proposition that draft documents could not constitute a legally valid offer.

26     The Court of Appeal in _Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 332</span> at \[47\] (“_Gay Choon Ing_”) adopted the following definition of offer and acceptance:

> An offer, capable of being converted into an agreement by acceptance, must consist of a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted.

> ……

> An acceptance is a final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer.

27     However, these concepts should not be applied in a mechanistic fashion (_Gay Choon Ing_ at \[49\]). The court may look at the whole course of negotiations between both parties in order to ascertain if an agreement is reached at any given point in time (at \[53\]). The terms should be both certain and complete (at \[50\]). This is an objective exercise, having regard to the relevant terms in the context in which they were arrived at and the substance of the contract (at \[55\] – \[60\]). The focus is on substance and not form.

28     In my view, a binding contract was formed between the parties for the sale and purchase of the Goods.

29     The WhatsApp exchanges on 18, 20 and 21 June 2018 between Mr Menno and Mr Lee[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) show Mr Menno asking for Mr Lee’s instructions on where to divert the Goods. This was predicated on the assumption that the defendant was purchasing the Goods. By instructing Mr Menno to direct the shipment to Tianjin, Mr Lee communicated that the defendant would be purchasing the Goods, and therefore had the attendant right to direct its destination.

30     By sending the Draft Quotation to the defendant on 3 July 2018, the plaintiff was specifying the following terms in writing:

> (a)     The plaintiff and the defendant were the parties to the contract.

> (b)     The contract was for the sale and purchase of the Goods.

> (c)     The price was USD 154,704.

> (d)     The shipping terms were “CNF Tianjin”.

> (e)     The payment terms were “20% Deposit. 80% against Bill of Lading”.

31     After this, on 4 July 2018, Mr Menno sent the WhatsApp message at 9.28 am stating that “Hi Daniel officially we need deposit for the JW Black / Chivas but as I appreciate you keep your word it is fine to pay the balance at once a week before arrival.” This meant that the plaintiff was offering to allow the defendant to pay the deposit at a later point in time, i.e., one week before the Goods arrived at their destination.

32     The defendant’s Ms Goh responded to the Draft Quotation by email on 4 July 2018 at 12.36 pm and again at 12.55 pm to specify the consignee as FZSL. By doing so, she effectively communicated that the Goods were being purchased by the defendant and consigned to FZSL. The defendant would not otherwise be in a position to specify the consignee.

33     In my view, this was an act of acceptance of the terms on offer that formed a binding contract.

34     Mr Lee’s explanation that the details of the consignee was only sent to the plaintiff for it to prepare a proper quotation[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) was not credible considering the context. Parties were not negotiating in the abstract. By this time, the Goods had been shipped out of Australia and Mr Lee had instructed Mr Menno to send them to Tianjin. In this context, the provision of the consignee details was to inform the plaintiff who to name as the consignee to receive the goods at Tianjin. It was not merely for the preparation of a proper quotation. The transaction had progressed past that stage and the Goods were on their way to the destination port. The defendant was merely providing the final detail - the named consignee, FZSL.

35     In the circumstances, a binding contract was formed between the parties with the following terms:

> (a)     The parties were the plaintiff and the defendant.

> (b)     The contract was for the sale and purchase of the Goods.

> (c)     The price was USD 154,704.

> (d)     The shipping terms were “CNF Tianjin”.

> (e)     The payment terms were for a deposit of 20% of the purchase price, to be paid one week before the arrival of the Goods, and the balance 80% of the purchase price to be paid against the presentation of a bill of lading.

> (the “**Contract**”).

36     In furtherance of the Contract, the plaintiff sent the Pro Forma Invoice on 13 July 2018.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) By this, the plaintiff reiterated to the defendant that the purchase price was due to be paid on 31 July 2018 in two parts: (i) 20% (as the delayed payment of the deposit); and (ii) 80% “against BL”, which echoed the phrase “against Bill of Lading” in the Draft Quotation.

37     This date of 31 July 2018 was consistently the date one week before the Goods were expected to arrive. On 19 July 2018, the plaintiff informed the defendant by WhatsApp that the ETA, or estimated time of arrival, was 7 August 2018 on the Vessel Xin Chang Shu / 0XB0FW1NC/036S,[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) one week after 31 July 2018.

38     The defendant’s subsequent conduct also made it clear that it had already accepted the offer. In fact, it reassured the plaintiff time and time again that it would perform the Contract by taking the Goods:

> (a)     As mentioned above, it directed the plaintiff to divert the Goods to Tianjin and specified FZSL as the consignee.

> (b)     On 1 August 2018, by WhatsApp, the defendant asked for the bill of lading. In response, on 1 and 6 August 2018, the three documents (Pro Forma Invoice, packing list, and Draft BL) were sent to the defendant by email.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) The defendant did not respond further.

> (c)     On 8 August 2018, and in response to the plaintiff’s threat of 7 August 2018 to make “alternative arrangements”, Mr Lee said “I assured that this will be settled. There’s no need to look for alternative… But give me a couple of days, since I promise to take it. I will take it”.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) The defendant argued that the plaintiff’s threat meant that there was no binding agreement between the parties. I disagreed. In my view, the plaintiff was threatening to make alternative arrangements to mitigate the defendant’s breach of contract as the defendant had not even paid the deposit. This explains why the defendant sought to reassure the plaintiff of the defendant’s promise to purchase the Goods.

> (d)     It appeared that the plaintiff accepted the defendant’s reassurance. On 13 August 2018, the Plaintiff’s John responded to say “Well noted, and “Please kindly send through remittance”. This was met with the defendant’s further reassurance that it would honour the Contract. On 16 August 2018, Mr Lee again said “Will get that done. Give me a couple of day”.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

> (e)     The defendant’s third reassurance took place between 27 and 28 August 2018. When Mr Menno demanded again for payment, Mr Lee responded “I’m trying”. [\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41)

> (f)     Finally, and in response to Mr Menno’s demand for payment on 12 October 2018, Mr Lee apologised for the delay on 16 October 2018. On the next day, 17 October 2018, Mr Lee indicated that he was procuring funds to make payment.[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42) The defendant’s consistent message to the plaintiff was that it was raising funds to perform its obligations under the Contract.

39     In its closing submissions, the defendant submitted that Mr Lee only made these statements under a mistake of fact - i.e. that the Goods were still lying in storage and not delivered to the consignee. It relied on an email dated 23 November 2018 from Audrey Joly of JF Hillebrand[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) to say that plaintiff had lost possession and control over the goods by 6 August 2018.

40     This was a belated change in position which I was not prepared to accept.

> (a)     First, mistakes of fact are material facts that need to be pleaded. As the plaintiff submitted, this alleged mistake was only raised for the first time in closing submissions. The plaintiff specifically pleaded the defendant’s acknowledgments at SOC, \[3A(f)\] – \[3A(h)\]. However, the response at Defence, \[6.4\] was merely that the defendant made these assurances on the premise that the payment was to be made against presentation of the bill of lading. No alleged mistake of fact was pleaded.

> (b)     Second and in any event, the allegation was not supported by the evidence. The alleged mistake was not raised in Mr Lee’s AEIC (see e.g. at \[19\]).[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44)

> (c)     Third, the alleged mistake was a non-sequitur. The defendant was not alleging that it entered into a binding contract under a mistake of fact. The defendant’s case was merely that Mr Lee made reassurances to make payment under a mistake of fact.

41     For completeness, it appears that the defendant has abandoned the pleaded defence that the defendant was merely acting as an agent of FZSL, which was the principal in the transaction with the plaintiff (see Defence, \[5\]). In any case, I would have found that the plaintiff and the defendant were the intended parties to the transaction. While FZSL was the defendant’s nominated consignee, the defendant did not adduce any evidence to show that FZSL was the principal contracting party.

## Whether the payment of a 20% deposit was a condition precedent to contract formation

42     The defendant also alleged that the requirement of a 20% deposit was a condition precedent to the formation of contract. Since the defendant never paid the deposit, no binding contract was formed.

43     I disagreed that this was a transaction where the seller required the purchaser to pay the deposit in order to accept the offer.

44     As set out at \[35\] above, a binding contract was formed between the parties with the payment terms for a deposit of 20% of the purchase price, to be paid one week before the arrival of the Goods (i.e. 31 July 2018), and the balance 80% of the purchase price to be paid against the presentation of a bill of Lading.

45     By the time the deposit was due to be paid, the plaintiff had already acted on the defendant’s instructions to divert the Goods to Tianjin and the defendant’s nomination of FZSL as the consignee. Quite clearly, there was no requirement that the deposit had to be paid in order for a binding contract to be formed.

46     Further, the defendant’s continued reassurance that it would take the Goods as set out at \[38\] above reflected its own understanding that the formation of contract was not dependent on it making payment of the deposit.

47     I found this to be a self-serving and unmeritorious argument. The defendant was attempting to rely on its own failure to make payment of the deposit to argue that no contract was formed. However, its own actions belied this assertion. Not only did it instruct the plaintiff to ship the Goods to Tianjin, it also nominated the consignee and repeatedly reassured the plaintiff that it would take the Goods. The defendant’s failure to pay the deposit was not an indication that no contract existed – it was simply a breach of contract.

## Whether the defendant’s payment of 80% of the price was to be made against the presentation of an original bill of lading

48     The starting point is that the Draft Quotation which the plaintiff sent to the defendant on 3 July 2018 stated that the payment terms were “80% against Bill of Lading”.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45) This was repeated in the Pro Forma Invoice[^46] which the plaintiff sent on 13 July 2018 which stated “80% against BL”.

49     The plaintiff argued that the proper construction of the Contract was that it did not require the plaintiff to present an original bill of lading, but only a sea waybill, which the plaintiff also calls an “express bill of lading” for the following reasons:

> (a)     the defendant admitted that it was for the buyer to specify the type of bill of lading that was required;[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47)

> (b)     the defendant did not specify that an original bill of lading was required, and therefore there was no agreement that one was required;[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48)

> (c)     in another transaction between the defendant and a third party, a sea waybill rather than an original bill of lading was used;[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

> (d)     the defendant only asked for the bill of lading once by WhatsApp message on 1 Aug 2018. The Draft BL that was sent across reflected that it was not a draft of an original bill of lading. The defendant did not respond further, although it had a “duty to speak” to object if the terms of the draft bill of lading was not acceptable.

50     The defendant’s case was that the reference to “bill of lading” was a reference to an original bill of lading.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) It argued that it was important that an original bill of lading was a document of title because the defendant was not taking physical possession of the Goods and therefore its interests in the transaction could only be safeguarded if it had the original bill of lading, which would allow it to procure payment from the consignee or sell the Goods to other parties.[^51] In any case, neither an original bill of lading or the sea waybill was presented to the defendant for payment.[^52]

51     The Court of Appeal set out the relevant principles for interpreting a contractual term in _Y.E.S. F&B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 1187</span> (“_Y.E.S._”).

> (a)     When interpreting a contractual term, the text of the agreement is the first port of call (_Y.E.S._ at \[32\]). The “primary source of understanding what the parties meant is their language interpreted in accordance with the conventional usage”: _Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design & Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 1029</span> (“Zurich Insurance”) at \[57\].

> (b)     Where the text is ambiguous, the context generally becomes of first importance (_Y.E.S._ at \[34\]).

> (c)     Where the text is plain and unambiguous but leads to an absurd result, the court should undertake an examination of the context in order to determine if the text was indeed unambiguous as originally thought to be the case (_Y.E.S._ at \[31\]). However, the Court of Appeal warned that context cannot be used to justify the court rewriting the terms of the contract according to its view of what it thinks the result ought to be. In particular, an apparently absurd result should not be evaded if the objective evidence shows that it was within the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the contract (_Y.E.S._ at \[32\]).

52     In the context of a transaction involving shipping goods by sea, an original bill of lading and a sea waybill are very different documents.

53     In _The “Luna”_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 2 SLR 1054</span> (“_Luna_”), the Court of Appeal stated at \[29\] that the modern bill of lading serves three functions: it operates as (a) a receipt by the carrier acknowledging the shipment of goods on a particular vessel for carriage to a particular destination; (b) a memorandum of the terms of the contract of carriage; and (c) a document of title to the goods. As a document of title, presentation of an original bill of lading is ordinarily required to obtain delivery of cargo (see _APL Co Pte Ltd v Voss Peer_, <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 1119</span> at \[48\] (“_APL Co_”)).

54     By contrast, a sea waybill is not a document of title. It is a contract of carriage whereby the carrier undertakes to deliver the cargo to the person identified by the shipper as entitled to take delivery of the cargo. It is merely a receipt and not a document of title (_APL Co_, \[53\]). As the plaintiff used the terms “sea waybill” and “express bill of lading” interchangeably, for clarity, I will refer to this document as a “sea waybill”.

55     Turning to the present case, it is my view that the ordinary or conventional meaning of the phrase “Bill of Lading” in the Draft Quotation refers to an original bill of lading which serves the three functions of a modern bill of lading set out in _Luna_ at \[29\], including, in particular, operating as a document of title.

56     This construction did not lead to any absurd result in the context of this case. On the contrary, there was sound commercial reasoning for such a construction:

> (a)     Requiring payment for goods to be made against the presentation of an original bill of lading accords with ordinary commercial sense since an original bill of lading confers rights of title to its bearer.

> (b)     Further, in this case, the purchaser and the consignee are two separate parties. The defendant persuasively explained that having an original bill of lading would allow it to protect its rights vis-à-vis the consignee by empowering the defendant to withhold release of the Goods or demand for payment.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53)

57     As such, both the plain and contextual construction of “Bill of Lading” point towards the phrase referring to an original bill of lading.

58     The plaintiff’s argument that the defendant never said that it required an original bill of lading was unpersuasive. The express term requiring 80% of the price to be paid “against Bill of Lading” was found in the Draft Quote and Pro Forma Invoice. The plaintiff prepared these documents and relied on them to prove the terms of the contract between the parties. It was also responsible for procuring the shipping contract for the Goods. If the plaintiff intended to ship the Goods with a sea waybill instead of an original bill of lading within the ordinary meaning of the phrase, it could have simply specified this in its own documents. The _contra proferentum_ rule operated against the plaintiff in this case.

59     There was also no evidence of a course of conduct between the parties which showed that they intended the reference to a “Bill of Lading” to mean a sea waybill rather than an original bill of lading. The plaintiff pointed out that there was another transaction between the defendant and a different party where the defendant shipped goods to FZSL on an ocean bill of lading which did not function as a document of title.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) However, it did not adduce any evidence of the underlying transaction for that shipment. In any case, it was not a transaction between the parties to this suit. I found that this did not assist the plaintiff.

60     The plaintiff’s next argument is that it had sent the Draft BL to the defendant on 1 August 2018, and the defendant never objected to its terms although it had a “duty to speak” if it required an original bill of lading. At the outset, I note that this argument was not relevant to the construction of the phrase “against Bill of Lading”. As discussed at \[28\] – \[33\] above, a binding contract had formed between the parties by the time the defendant specified the consignee on 4 July 2018. Mr Lee asked for the bill of lading after that, on 1 August 2018. Further, Mr Lee’s request was made in response to the plaintiff’s Mr Menno chasing Mr Lee for payment on 24 and 30 July 2018 (see above, \[21\] – \[22\]). As such, even from the plaintiff’s perspective, by the time the draft bill of lading was sent to the defendant, the contract was already formed and the plaintiff was entitled to payment.

61     This argument of a “duty to speak” was therefore only relevant to the question of whether the defendant had waived the requirement for the plaintiff to present an original bill of lading by representing that the defendant would accept a bill of lading in the terms of the Draft BL, or that it would make payment without requiring an original bill of lading.

## Did the defendant waive the requirement for an original bill of lading and/or was it estopped from insisting on one?

62     The defendant never made any express representation that it was accepting the terms of the Draft BL or that it would make payment without receiving an original bill of lading. It merely kept silent after receiving a copy of the Draft BL. Later, when it made assurances that it would take the Goods and pay for them, there was no mention that this would be done without the presentation of an original bill of lading.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)

63     The plaintiff’s argument is that the defendant’s silence was a sufficient representation because the defendant had a duty to speak.

64     The alleged “duty to speak” is not a legal duty as such but the effect of silence in circumstances that would result in a waiver. As the Court of Appeal in _Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian Hiap Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 317</span> at \[61\] explained:

> The expression “duty to speak” does not refer to a legal duty as such, but to circumstances in which a failure to speak would lead a reasonable party to think that the other party has elected between two inconsistent rights or will forbear to enforce a particular right in the future, as the case may be. We emphasise that this is not the subjective assessment of the other party but an objective assessment made by reference to how a reasonable person apprised of the relevant facts would view the silence in the circumstances, though unsurprisingly, the parties’ relationship and the applicable law which governs it will be a critical focus of the court’s assessment of whether those circumstances exist.

65     The key question is whether the defendant’s silence in the circumstances of this case constituted a clear and unequivocal communication that the plaintiff did not need to present an original bill of lading against payment.

66     I find that there was no such clear and unequivocal communication.

67     A relevant point of context is that the shipment of the Goods by way of a sea waybill rather than an original bill of lading appears to be an error on the plaintiff’s part and not a conscious decision:

> (a)     The agreement provided that goods were shipped on a CNF basis. “CNF” is the old abbreviation for “cost & freight”, now abbreviated as “CFR” under the International Chamber of Commerce’s rules on the use of domestic and international trade terms (_The “Yue You 902”_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 573</span> at \[76\]). The seller contracts for and pays the costs and freight necessary to bring the Goods to the named port of destination.

> (b)     Before the defendant specified that FZSL was the consignee on 4 July 2018, the plaintiff had already placed a booking with JF Hillebrand for the shipment of the Goods to Tianjin on 29 June 2018.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56)

> (c)     JF Hillebrand’s Mr Jorge initially stated in his AEIC that the plaintiff required them to ship the Goods through the use of a sea waybill.[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) In cross-examination, Mr Jorge explained that this was not a specific instruction. Rather, it was JF Hillebrand’s normal practice to ship goods by sea waybill unless a specific instruction was given to them to ship goods by original bill of lading.[^58]

> (d)     The plaintiff did not appear to have realised that the Goods were shipped by way of a sea waybill rather than an original bill of lading, and this error appeared to have persisted even up to 23 November 2018. The plaintiff produced an email from Audrey Joly dated 23 November 2018[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) (AB 33) which started with “_You nominated JF Hillebrand to handle this shipment to China with no request of original B/L, by default we would release the ctr to consignee without getting another approval from your side to do so._” Ms Joly was responding to an earlier email that Mr Van had sent to her, but that earlier email was unfortunately not disclosed. However, it can be deduced that Mr Van had asked about an original bill of lading and why the Goods were released to the consignee without the plaintiff’s approval. This meant that the plaintiff did not consciously choose to ship the Goods by sea waybill, and did not realise that this was done even after the fact.

> (e)     The plaintiff’s executive director, one Eddy Nelson Mendonca Amaro, filed an affidavit on 13 February 2020 in response to the defendant’s application to set aside default judgment that the plaintiff initially obtained. In that affidavit, the plaintiff stated that it did not agree with JF Hillebrand’s explanation found in the email of Ms Joly’s email of 23 November 2018 as to why JF Hillebrand did not issue an original bill of lading but rather a sea waybill (at \[13\]). This made it clear that the shipment of the Goods by sea waybill was an error.

68     With this background in mind, I examine the circumstances under which the defendant kept silent.

69     It bears repeating that it was the plaintiff’s own Draft Quotation and Pro Forma Invoice that provided for 80% of the price to be payable “against Bill of Lading”. In these circumstances, the defendant would normally expect the plaintiff to arrange for shipping, obtain the original bill of lading, and present it for payment.

70     Instead of doing so, the plaintiff booked the shipment through JF Hillebrand which shipped the Goods by way of a sea waybill as a default practice. As set out above, the failure to ship the Goods with an original bill of lading appeared to be an unintended error on the plaintiff’s part.

71     When the plaintiff asked for payment on 24 and 30 July 2018, the defendant responded with a request for the bill of lading on 1 August 2018.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) This was consistent with the notion that the defendant expected to receive an original bill of lading before it had to make payment. When the plaintiff then sent across the copy of the Draft BL to the defendant, it simply kept silent and did not make payment.

72     I did not think that this situation was sufficient to give rise to a “duty to speak” such that the defendant’s silence constituted a clear and unequivocal representation that the defendant would not require an original bill of lading in order to make payment. This silence was equivocal at best.

> (a)     First, the Draft BL was simply forwarded to the defendant together with a demand for payment.

>> (i)       This was in itself odd. A draft document could not conceivably trigger the payment obligation, whether it was a bill of lading or a sea waybill.

>> (ii)       It would have been incumbent on the plaintiff to either perform its obligation to deliver the bill of lading to the defendant or obtain the defendant’s agreement to vary the payment terms.

>> (iii)       Merely sending the Draft BL and demanding payment did not create any duty to speak. And the defendant’s silence at this stage did not clearly and unequivocally represent that it was going to accept the presentation of a document in the terms of the Draft BL.

> (b)     Second, there was a practical reason for the defendant’s silence at that point. The defendant’s subsequent responses between 8 August 2018 to 12 October 2018 (see \[23\] above) made it clear that the defendant faced cash flow problems and was in the process of gathering funds to purchase the Goods. The defendant was simply not in a position to pay even if the plaintiff had presented the original bill of lading. The defendant’s silence could have also meant that it was not ready to complete the transaction.

73     I move on to consider the effect of the defendant’s subsequent assurances discussed at \[38\] above and whether they could constitute the requisite representation. In my view, none of the defendant’s responses were inconsistent with the notion that the defendant expected to receive an original bill of lading against payment.

74     To elaborate, when the defendant assured the plaintiff that it would take the goods and be responsible for them, or that it was gathering funds for payment, these assurances did not suggest that the defendant was waiving its right to receive an original bill of lading against payment. In my view, these responses merely meant that the defendant was serious and wanted to proceed with the transaction, but needed time to raise funds. There was no clear and unequivocal communication that it would pay without receiving an original bill of lading.

75     Further, throughout the time that these assurances were made by the defendant, the plaintiff conveyed the impression to the defendant that the Goods remained in port, ready to be delivered once payment was made.

> (a)     For example, Mr Menno sent a WhatsApp message to Mr Lee on 20 September 2018 stating: “You gave us your word it would all be solved. We are keeping the container in the port because you told us so. Now you are not communicating. If you are not coming back to me very soon we are going to ship back the container, pay all costs.”

> (b)     There is some evidence that the plaintiff’s Mr Van was knowingly creating this false impression. Ms Joly’s email of 23 November 2018 stated that JF Hillebrand was asked by the plaintiff on 6 August 2018 to hold the shipment, but it was too late because the document had already been released to the consignee by then.[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61) However, on 7 August 2018, Mr Van still sent an email to Mr Lee asking if the payment would be settled and threatened to make “alternative arrangements”.[^62] This was likely to be an empty threat given that JF Hillebrand could not hold the shipment. However, it gave the defendant the impression that alternative arrangements could still be made, which would have meant that the plaintiff was still in control of the Goods and therefore in a position to, if necessary, present an original bill of lading in exchange for payment.

76     To sum up, the defendant’s failure to specifically request for an original bill of lading or its subsequent communications to affirm its intention to proceed with the transaction did not constitute any clear and unequivocal communication that the defendant did not require an original bill of lading to be presented against payment. It simply wanted to continue with the transaction and was under the impression that the plaintiff was in a position to comply with its obligations as it was still in control of the goods.

77     For the same reasons, I do not agree that the defendant had acknowledged a debt to the plaintiff _regardless of whether or not the plaintiff would exchange an original bill of lading for payment._ The defendant only acknowledged that it was responsible to purchase the Goods, and was raising money for the purchase price in order to make payment for the Goods. The defendant did not go further to say or give the impression that it would be making payment _without_ receiving an original bill of lading for the Goods.

78     In conclusion, I find that there was no waiver of the requirement that the plaintiff presents an original bill of lading against payment of 80% of the purchase price, and the defendant is not estopped from insisting on it.

## Did the plaintiff deliver the Goods to FZSL?

79     I move on to address the defendant’s arguments that title and risk in the goods remained with the plaintiff, and that there was no evidence that the goods were delivered to FZSL.

80     I accept the plaintiff’s evidence given through Mr Jorge that the Goods were shipped to Tianjin under a sea waybill and delivered to the defendant’s nominated consignee, FZSL.[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63) The three main documents relied on were (i) a copy of the sea waybill endorsed by FZSL;[^64] (ii) a copy of a blank telex release form also endorsed by FZSL; and (iii) a copy of a screenshot titled “Tax Invoice Query and Printing” appearing to show that the fees to procure the delivery of the Goods at the port of destination were paid by one Beijing Jinlun International Logistics Co. Ltd (“Beijing Jinlun”).[^65] JF Hillebrand explained that FZSL had engaged a shipping lines agent, Penavico, who in turn engaged a broker agent, Beijing Jinlun to receive the Goods.[^66]

81     The defendant pointed out a number of problems with the documents:

> (a)     First, the defendant pointed out that the copy of sea waybill endorsed by FZSL and relied on by JF Hillebrand was inconsistent with the electronic copy found in Jorge’s AEIC[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67) in that there were formatting errors. In my view, nothing turned on this. There was no allegation that the substantive terms of the endorsed sea waybill were different from the electronic copy. Both Mr Jorge and Mr Lee accepted in cross-examination that the substantive terms of the endorsed copy and the electronic copy were the same.

> (b)     Second, the defendant also argued that the endorsement of the sea waybill was wrong because it was endorsed by FZSL rather than JF Hillebrand or the carrier. It relied on Mr Jorge’s evidence in cross-examination that either JF Hillebrand or the carrier would endorse the document,[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) and that the endorsement on the sea waybill belonged to JF Hillebrand’s China office. This entire argument appeared to have arisen from Mr Jorge’s error as to who endorsed the sea waybill. On its face, the sea waybill was endorsed by FZSL. However, Mr Jorge mistakenly thought that the document was endorsed by JF Hillebrand’s China office. It was not explained to Mr Jorge in cross-examination that the Chinese words on the endorsement belonged to FZSL. Mr Jorge could not read the endorsement, which was in Chinese, hence his mistake. At the end of the day, nothing of substance arose from this. JF Hillebrand had the power to authorise the release of the Goods and Mr Jorge came to court to state JF Hillebrand’s position that the Goods were released to FZSL after accepting the endorsed sea waybill. A copy of this endorsed sea waybill was exhibited to Mr Jorge’s AEIC. It did not really matter who specifically endorsed it. What mattered was that it was accepted by JF Hillebrand.

> (c)     The defendant also argued that FZSL’s endorsed telex release was blank and did not give any details of the shipment or goods. Mr Jorge’s simple explanation was that this was not common but happened occasionally. In any case, nothing turned on this. JF Hillebrand’s position was that it accepted the document and the Goods were released to FZSL. There was nothing to suggest that FZSL would not have been able to obtain the Goods simply because the endorsed telex release was blank.

> (d)     Finally, the defendant complained that the screenshot titled “Tax Invoice Query and Printing” that JF Hillebrand relied on to prove that Beijing Jinlun had made payment of various charges was problematic because (i) the bill of lading number was different from the sea waybill under which the Goods were shipped; (ii) the name of the vessel was “New Changbiao” rather than “Xin Chang Shu” in the sea waybill; and (iii) the document was dated 24 July 2020, some two years after the Goods were allegedly delivered.

> (e)     Again, nothing turned on these complaints. Addressing (i), Mr Jorge explained that the bill of lading number could have reflected the house bill of lading rather than the sea waybill.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69) Addressing (ii), the plaintiff called one Poon Yu Da, the business development manager of the company that carried out the translation, JusConnect LLP, to explain that the earlier translation of “New Changbiao” was an error and “Xin Chang Shu” was the accurate translation of the Chinese characters of the vessel name “新常熟”. Addressing (iii), Mr Jorge explained that this was the date the document was printed, rather than the date that the Goods were delivered.[^70]

82     Apart from finding fault with JF Hillebrand’s documents, the defendant did not go further to take the positive position that the Goods were not delivered to FZSL. It merely put the plaintiff to strict proof that the Goods were shipped and delivered to FZSL.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) The plaintiff has proved its case as JF Hillebrand, who was responsible for shipping the Goods to FZSL, had its representative Mr Jorge attend court to confirm that the Goods were indeed shipped to Tianjin and released to FZSL, accompanied by the supporting documents.

83     On the other hand, FZSL was the defendant’s nominated consignee. The defendant also had multiple dealings with FZSL as well as FZSL’s related company, Fuzhou All Yucheng Import and Export Trade Co Ltd.[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72) One would expect the defendant to have been able to obtain some evidence from FZSL to show that the Goods were never delivered to it. No such evidence was adduced.

84     On the balance of probabilities, I find that the Goods were delivered to FZSL and that title passed from the plaintiff to FZSL.

85     As for risk, as explained in _Profindo Pte Ltd v Abani Trading Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 214</span> at \[38\], the risk of goods in a cost & freight contract passes from seller to buyer across the ship’s rail at the port of loading. The seller is not normally concerned with what happens to the goods in transit. Risk had therefore passed to the defendant who was the buyer.

86     However, these matters do not resolve the contractual question of whether the defendant is now obliged to pay the other 80% of the purchase price. Since the Contract required the plaintiff to present an original bill of lading against payment and it has not done so, the defendant’s payment obligation is not triggered. The defendant is only obliged to pay the deposit of 20%.

87     Finally, the defendant made a bare assertion that the plaintiff failed in its duty to mitigate its loss without explaining why.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) Given my decision on the other substantive issues, this assertion is a non-starter.

88     In the circumstances, I granted the plaintiff judgment for 20% of USD 154,704, or USD 30,940.80.

## Costs

89     The plaintiff submitted that it had partially succeeded in its claim, and costs should follow the event. It submitted that the defendant should pay costs of $30,000 and disbursements of $18,500. As Mr Menno gave evidence remotely from the Netherlands, a significant part of the disbursements included a sum of $8,700 charged by a law firm in the Netherlands, Kennedy Van Der Laan (“KVDL”) for hosting and supporting Mr Menno’s evidence taking.

90     The defendant argued that it succeeded in defending 80% of the claim. On that basis, the defendant submitted that it should pay costs of no more than $15,000 for the action. It also disputed the plaintiff’s entitlement to the full sum charged by KVDL but was not in a position to detail the objections as it did not have the relevant invoices or time sheets. The defendant did not dispute the rest of the disbursements sought by the plaintiff.

91     I preferred the defendant’s submissions on the quantum of costs as the plaintiff only succeeded in obtaining 20% of its claim. However, as it was a two-day trial and significant work was done, I added a slight uplift. I fixed costs at $16,000 plus GST plus reasonable disbursements fixed at $9,791.04, and reserved the issue of KVDL’s disbursements to a later date. I also directed the plaintiff to furnish copies of KVDL’s invoices and time sheets to the defendant for the relevant objections to be presented.

92     The plaintiff’s solicitors previously gave an undertaking for security for costs dated 14 December 2021 and this was discharged accordingly.
