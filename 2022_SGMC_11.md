### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 55-year-old male Singaporean, was subject to a remission order under s 50I of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (“PA”) from 3 August 2021 to 29 December 2023 (both dates inclusive) made by the Commissioner of Prisons upon his release from prison. As part of the remission order, the accused was placed under the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”) with conditions pursuant to s 50V(3) of the PA.

2       On 11 January 2022, the accused pleaded guilty to the singular charge of committing a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition under the MAS by failing to remain indoors daily between 10pm and 6am at the Selarang Halfway House (“SHWH”) as specified in his remission order. The accused had breached his curfew period between 5 August 2021 and 10 October 2021 for a total period of 1572 hours and 30 minutes.

3       The accused has therefore committed an offence punishable under s 50Y(1)(a) of the PA and was liable to be punished with a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of his remission order of 875 days from 7 August 2021 to 29 December 2023. He was unrepresented.

4       I imposed a sentence of 750 days’ imprisonment. The sentence was backdated to the date of the accused’s arrest on 10 October 2021.

5       On 12 January 2022, a Notice of Appeal was filed by the accused against the sentence imposed on him.

15     Additionally, between 1982 to 2021, the accused was placed either in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) or under drug supervision for 16 times over various periods.

16     The accused confirmed his antecedents to be correct.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

17     The Prosecution tendered written submissions and submitted for a sentence of at least 787 days of the remaining duration of the accused’s remission order.

18     The Prosecution submitted that the applicable sentencing framework for offences under s 50Y of the PA is as set out by the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib Bin Aziman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span> (“_Abdul Mutalib”_).

19     Based on the sentencing framework in _Abdul Mutalib_, the Prosecution was of the view that the accused’s case fell within Band 3 of the sentencing framework, which comprises cases of breaches with high severity and which attracts sentences of between two-thirds and the full remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the relevant offence.

20     The Prosecution elaborated that the gravity of the breach by the accused was severe in the present case because he had failed to remain at SHWH for 1572 hours and 30 minutes. This was more than five times as long as the 279 hours and 25 minutes duration in _Abdul Mutalib_, which was described to be “relatively grave” by the High Court (at \[120(a)\]). In _Abdul Mutalib_, the High Court held that a sentence of about 60% of the remaining period of remission would be appropriate where the offender had failed to remain indoors for 279 hours and 25 minutes, committed the breach just over two months after his release from prison and did not return to the halfway house despite repeated requests for him to do so.

21     The Prosecution further submitted that the rehabilitative prospects of the accused was poor. The accused had breached a mandatory aftercare condition under the MAS less than a week upon his release from prison on 3 August 2021. He ignored repeated attempts by the SHWH staff to contact and convince him to return. Text messages were also sent via SMS and WhatsApp advising him to update his location and return to SHWH immediately.

22     The accused is also heavily traced, being convicted of a plethora of varied offences from theft in dwelling, disorderly behaviour, robbery and drug offences since 2001. The Prosecution submitted that this evinced a failure for the accused to be rehabilitated despite numerous encounters with the law.

23     The Prosecution also highlighted that even though the accused had pleaded guilty, this should be given little weight because the accused could be considered to have been caught “red-handed” the moment the staff at SHWH found out he had absconded. The present offence concerned a breach of monitoring conditions, which could easily be proven at trial. The Prosecution therefore submitted that a guilty plea in such circumstances should carry limited mitigating value: See _Leong Sow Hon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 228</span> at \[72\] and _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[65\].

24     In the circumstances, given the significant length of time of the accused’s breach, coupled with his poor rehabilitative prospects, this would not only warrant the imposition of two-third to the full duration of the remaining remission period but also a sentencing range at the upper end of Band 3 i.e., high severity. The Prosecution therefore submitted an imprisonment term amounting to at least 90% or about 787 days of the remaining duration of the accused’s remission order.

25     Finally, the Prosecution urged the court not to consider a downward adjustment of a sentence of at least 787 days’ imprisonment as this could not be considered as crushing and not in keeping with the accused’s past record and future prospects. It had also considered that the accused did surrender to the authorities instead of being arrested on 10 October 2021 when his family brought him to the PCC to surrender.

## Mitigation

26     The accused tendered his handwritten mitigation plea.

27     The accused stated that he was sorry and remorseful for committing the offence. After listening to the advice of his family and mother, he decided to surrender to the authorities. On 10 October 2021, the accused’s family brought him to the PCC to surrender. When he surrendered, his urine specimen was found to be negative of any drugs.

28     When an officer from the MAS came to take his statement for the breach of his curfew, he was informed by the officer that even though the people from the MAS would like to give him a second chance, they were however unable to do so as there was a protocol to proceed with his matter in court for the judge’s determination. The accused was remanded since the day of his arrest.

29     As such, the accused pleaded to the court for a second chance by giving him a stern warning and a lighter sentence. The accused promised that he would complete the remainder of his MAS and start afresh for good.

30     At an earlier plead guilty (“PG”) hearing on 22 November 2021, I did inform the accused, when asked, that I did not have the powers to administer a stern warning to him. If he wished, he would need to make his own representation to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”). As the accused did not have any legal representation, I further informed him of Prosecution’s position on sentence. The accused then informed me that since the Prosecution was seeking for a long custodial sentence, he would request his family to help him apply for legal aid. In the circumstances, I adjourned the matter to 15 December 2021 for him to contact his family to help him submit an application to the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”) for legal aid.

31     At the adjourned hearing on 15 December 2021, the accused informed me that he has changed his mind about applying for legal aid or getting a lawyer. He decided to plead guilty. The case was therefore fixed for PG hearing again on 11 January 2022.

32     At the PG hearing on 11 January 2022, I reiterated to the accused that I did not have the powers to administer a stern warning to him. In fact, it was mandatory for me to impose a custodial sentence should the accused decide to plead guilty to the s 50Y offence. The accused understood and pleaded to the court in mitigation for a lighter sentence as he hoped to be out of prison and be reunited with his family soon. He has realised his mistake.

## Decision on sentence

33     The issue before me was the appropriate custodial sentence to impose on the accused for the proceeded charge.

34     Ss 50Y(1) and (2) of the PA state:

> **Offence of serious breach of mandatory aftercare condition**

> 50Y.─ (1)    A person who commits a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of his remission order shall be guilty of an offence and _shall be liable on conviction_ to —

>> (a) _imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order_, as determined based on the date of the offence; or

>> (b) imprisonment for any term or for life, if the duration of the remission order is for life.

> (2)    In deciding the punishment to be imposed for an offence under subsection (1), the court is to consider —

>> (a)    the gravity of the serious breach;

>> (b)    the length of time for which the person did not commit any breach of a mandatory aftercare condition after being released under the remission order;

>> (c)    whether the serious breach evidences a lack of commitment by the person to his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society; and

>> (d)    all other relevant circumstances. \[emphasis added\]

35     S 50V(1) and s 50V(3)(c) of the PA state:

> **Mandatory aftercare conditions and variations, etc.**

> 50V.─(1)    The Commissioner may, in accordance with this section and for the purpose of facilitating a person’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society, require a person to whom this Division applies to comply with mandatory aftercare conditions.

> …

> (3) The mandatory aftercare conditions referred to in subsection (2) are as follows:

>> …

>> (c)    the person shall remain indoors at his place of residence, or at such other place as the Commissioner may specify, at any such time as the Commissioner may specify in the notice under subsection (2);

36     Under the Prisons Regulations (Cap 247, Rg, 2), a serious breach of the mandatory aftercare conditions is defined in r 151H(1)(a) as follows:

> **Serious and minor breaches of mandatory aftercare conditions**

> 151H.─(1)    The following shall be serious breaches of mandatory aftercare conditions for the purposes of section 50Y of the Act:

>> (a)    where as a result of one or more breaches of section 50V(3)(c) of the Act, the person fails, for a cumulative period of 24 hours, to remain indoors in accordance with that section;…

37     Under s 50Y(1) of the PA, an imposition of an imprisonment term is mandatory upon conviction of the accused. Subsection (a) states that the duration of imprisonment shall not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order as determined based on the date of the offence.

38     As highlighted by the Prosecution, the applicable sentencing framework when sentencing an accused for committing a serious breach of the mandatory aftercare condition whilst on remission under s 50Y(1) of the PA is as set out in the seminal decision by the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib_.

39     The High Court in _Abdul Mutalib_ adopted the sentencing band approach comprising a three-fold classification of the degree of severity of the serious breach in relation to the mandatory aftercare condition concerned. The appropriate sentence under each of the three sentencing bands would be based on the remaining duration of the remission order up to the full remaining duration at the time of the relevant offences. At \[47\], the three sentencing bands were set out as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.002400480096%"> <col width="27.625525105021%"> <col width="60.372074414883%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Degree of severity</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range (based on the remaining duration of the remission order)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 1/3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to the full remaining duration</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

40     In identifying the appropriate degree of severity within a particular sentencing band, the sentencing court should have due consideration to the statutory factors as set out in ss 50Y(2)(a) – (d) of the PA, which are as follows:

> (a)     the gravity of the serious breach;

> (b)     the length of time for which the person did not commit any breach of a mandatory aftercare condition after being released under the remission order;

> (c)     whether the serious breach evidences a lack of commitment by the person to his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society; and

> (d)     all other relevant circumstances.

41     At \[48\], the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib_ added that the court should endeavour to arrive at a fraction or percentage of the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the relevant offence. The application of such an approach is not only reasonably workable but lends itself with some degree of consistency.

42     As for the gravity of the serious breach under s 50Y(2)(a) of the PA, this would, as a general rule, be a significant factor in the court’s consideration. The High Court held at \[54\] of _Abdul Mutalib_ that the gravity of the offence can be seen as a proxy indicator of the harm that has been caused by an offender’s failure to realise the promise of rehabilitation and reintegration, which would have been the primary reasons for the remission order granted to him:

> \[H\]ad the offender not been released early, the fresh or s 50Y offence in question would not have been committed. Thus, _the more serious that offence, the graver the harm flowing from the offender’s breach of his remission order_. The sentencing position flowing from this is intuitive: the more severe the fresh or s 50Y offence committed by the offender and the greater the harm caused, the greater should be the extent of the rescindment of the remission order. In our judgment, _the gravity of the fresh or s 50Y offence committed by the offender will ordinarily be a significant factor in determining the appropriate sentencing band_. _While the sentencing court ought not to ignore the other statutory factors, it should not downplay the significance of this factor in calibrating the sentence for that offence._ \[emphasis added\]

43     At \[56\] of _Abdul Mutalib_, the High Court elaborated that the gravity of a serious breach extends beyond the type of breach. Considerations ancillary to the type of breach such as the duration of the breach, consequences of the breach and motivations behind the breach are also relevant. If these have already been taken into account under s 50Y(2)(a), this should not be factored in again under s 50Y(2)(c) of the PA. Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the judgment of the court) further observed as follows:

> \[F\]inally, we observe that since s 50Y offences consist of serious breaches of MACs, gravity in this context would have to be considered relative to the entire spectrum of breaches of MACs. This is because the harm occasioned by breaches of MACs in and of themselves, being breaches of conditions that go towards monitoring an offender, would ordinarily not be significant.

44     As for the offender’s rehabilitative prospects, the factors for consideration are the: (1) timing of the s 50Y offence; and (2) offender’s lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration under ss 50Y(2)(b) and (c) of the PA respectively. These statutory factors are not exhaustive and the court must consider the totality of the circumstances when assessing: See \[57\] of _Abdul Mutalib._

45     As regards the timing of the s 50Y offence committed by the offender, the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib_ agreed that the smaller the window between the offender’s release from prison and his commission of the s 50Y offence, the greater should be the extent of the rescindment of the remission order. This would show a greater disregard for the conditions of the offender’s remission order. While this is conceptually distinct from the determination of the severity of the s 50Y offence committed by the offender for the purpose of identifying the appropriate sentence within a particular sentencing band, such an inference can be drawn as to the offender’s rehabilitative prospects from the fact that he has committed a s 50Y offence sooner rather than later after his release on remission: See \[58\].

46     As for the offender’s lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration, the High Court was of the view that the greater the evidence of the offender’s lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration, the greater will be the extent of the rescindment of the remission period. At \[63\] of _Abdul Mutalib_, the High Court added:

> \[W\]hether the commission of a fresh or s 50Y offence goes towards establishing a lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration on the offender’s part is a matter for the sentencing court to decide, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case. However, it is important to ensure that the identical consideration is not applied multiple times to the prejudice of the offender.

47     Finally, in relation to the factor that the court has to consider _“_all other relevant circumstances” under s 50Y(2)(d) of the PA, this is a residual catch-all provision meant to ensure that the court’s sentencing discretion is not fettered (at \[64\] of _Abdul Mutalib_). At \[65\] of _Abdul Mutalib_, Menon CJ said:

> We turn first to s 50Y, where the position is more straightforward. As s 50Y(1) creates a distinct offence, _the specific aggravating or mitigating factors pertinent to the case at hand can be considered without any concerns of double-counting_. This would typically include the offender’s guilty plea, although, as a practical matter, this has little weight where the offender has been caught “red-handed” (see Sim Gek Yong v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 185</span> at \[6\]). _Given that s 50Y offences often concern breaches of monitoring conditions, it seems difficult to envisage a situation where an offender would not be caught “red-handed”._ \[emphasis added\]

48     I then turn to consider the sentencing factors under s 50Y(2) of the PA to determine the appropriate sentencing band in the sentencing framework as set out in _Abdul Mutalib_ that should apply to the accused’s case.

### The gravity of the serious breach of the 50Y offence committed by the accused

49     The accused has breached his curfew in failing to remain indoors at SHWH between 5 August 2021 and 10 October 2021,

50     The breach is a substantive period of time as the duration was for a total of 1572 hours and 30 minutes, translating to about 65.5 days or slightly over 2 months.

51     I agreed with the Prosecution that the gravity of the serious breach was severe or high.

52     In _Abdul Mutalib_, the High Court held that the gravity of the serious breach was low when the duration of the breach was over a short period. A summary table comparing the gravity with the duration of the serious breach of the various accused in _Abdul Mutalib_ to that of the accused here is as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.98%"> <col width="29.66%"> <col width="23.74%"> <col width="27.62%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Name of Accused</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Duration of the breach</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Gravity of the breach</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>% of the duration as compared to Vincent’s breach</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Abdul</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">32 hours and 41 minutes</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.0%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Mani</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">58 hours and 30 minutes</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.7%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Norfarah</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">75 hours and 30 minutes</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4.8%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Amanshah</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">279 hours 25 minutes</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Relatively grave</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17.8%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

53     I would peg the gravity of Amanshah’s breach based on the duration of the breach at moderately grave or in the moderate range.

54     As highlighted by the Prosecution, the duration of the breach committed by the present accused of over 2 months was more than 5 times that of Amanshah of about 12 days. Yet, the breach committed by Amanshah was already considered as relatively or moderately grave by the High Court. In the circumstances, the gravity of the accused’s serious breach would have to be considered as high.

### The offender’s rehabilitative prospects

55     Based on the totality of the circumstances, I was of the view that the accused’s rehabilitative prospects here were poor.

56     Even though the accused did not commit any fresh offence during the period where he breached his curfew, the accused committed the serious breach barely two days after he was released from prison on 3 August 2021 for his LT2 and failing to report for urine test convictions. This was despite various attempts made by the staff of SHWH to locate and contact the accused as well as advising him to return to SHWH.

57     The accused was also heavily traced since 2001 and the MAS was intended to promote and assist the accused towards his rehabilitation and reintegration into society after his release. Despite that, the accused was non-compliant very shortly after his release.

58     Even though the accused did surrender to the authorities with the persuasion of his family members, this was however more than 2 months after he failed to return to SHWH.

59     Therefore, the accused’s conduct demonstrated a lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration back to the society on his part.

### Other relevant circumstances

60     First, I accepted that the accused has pleaded guilty and is remorseful as mitigating factors raised by him. At the same time, given that a s 50Y offence is one that often concerns breaches of monitoring conditions, it would be difficult to envisage a situation where an offender would not be caught “red-handed” the moment he or she is found to have absconded from SHWH: See \[65\] of _Abdul Mutalib_. Therefore, this factor should be given little weight as a matter of practicality.

61     Next, the fact that the accused has not committed a fresh offence whilst in breach of the mandatory aftercare conditions or that his urine test was negative of drugs when he surrendered should also be given little weight. This is because if the accused was found to have committed a fresh offence or was tested positive for drugs in his urine, he would, in all likelihood be faced with additional charge(s).

### The sentence imposed

62     For the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that the accused’s s 50Y offence in this case should fall within Band 3, which is at the high degree of severity as submitted by the Prosecution.

63     Based on the sentencing framework as enunciated in _Abdul Mutalib_, the sentencing range for the accused would fall within 2/3 to the full remaining duration of the remission order of 875 days (i.e. 583 to 875 days).

64     Whilst the Prosecution was of the view that the sentencing range should be pegged at the upper end of Band 3 at 90%, I was of the view that this should be pegged somewhere around the midpoint of Band 3 at about 85%. This would bring the accused’s sentence to 750 days. Had the accused been arrested instead of surrendering to the authorities with the encouragement of his family, I might have imposed the sentence as sought for by the Prosecution as an indication of his lack of cooperation.

65     All things considered, I did take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances of the case at hand in order to determine that the ultimate sentence is not too crushing on the accused and that it was in keeping with his past record and future prospects.

66     Finally, I backdated the accused’s sentence to commence on the date of his arrest on 10 October 2021, where he surrendered at the PCC.

## Conclusion

67     To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:
