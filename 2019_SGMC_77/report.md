5 December 2019

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Background

1       The Accused, Mr Seah Chin Peng, a 48-year-old Singapore Citizen, was a Police Officer holding the rank of Senior Staff Sergeant. He faced a total of four charges, three charges (namely the first, second and third charges) under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) for giving false information to a public servant and one charge of mischief under s 426 of the PC (namely the fourth charge). At the commencement of the trial, the Prosecution applied to withdraw the first charge and the Accused claimed trial to the remaining three charges. After the trial, at submissions stage, the Accused, who was legally represented, decided to plead guilty to the mischief charge. Thus, I found him guilty and convicted him of the mischief charge. In respect of the second and third charges under s 182 of the PC (“s 182 charges”), I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and accordingly I found him guilty and convicted him of the two s 182 charges as well. I sentenced the Accused to a total of 4 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment. The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision has appealed against his conviction and sentence. He is presently on bail pending appeal.

## S 182 charges (the second and third charges)

2       The s 182 charges[^1] that the Accused claimed trial to read as follows:

>      _1) MCN-902066-2017 (exhibit C1C)_

_2_ nd _CHARGE (AMENDED)_

> _You are charged that you, on 31 October 2016, at or about 5.30 pm, at the Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore, did give to a public servant, namely one Inspector Paige Tan, information that you knew to be false, to wit, by giving a self-recorded statement that while you were trying to avoid one Zeng Guoyuan, you lost your balance and stepped on his walking stick, which caused the said walking stick to break, knowing it to be likely that you would thereby cause the said Inspector Paige Tan to omit to conduct an investigation against you for intentionally damaging the said walking stick, which the said Inspector Paige Tan ought not to omit if the true state of facts were known by her, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

>      _2) MCN-902067-2017 (exhibit C2A)_

_3_ rd _CHARGE (AMENDED)_

> _You are charged that you, on 3 November 2016, at or about 12.03 pm, in Singapore, did give to a public servant, namely one Inspector Paige Tan, information that you knew to be false, to wit, by informing the said Inspector Paige Tan that a walking stick belonging to one Zeng Guoyuan, had been thrown away by members of the public and was no longer at the incident location at 178 Waterloo Street, Singapore when you returned to the said location to retrieve the said walking stick, knowing it be likely that you would thereby cause the said Inspector Paige Tan to omit to conduct an investigation against you for intentionally breaking the said walking stick, which the said Inspector Paige Tan ought not to omit if the true state of facts were known by her, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## Mischief charge (the fourth charge)

3       The mischief charge that the Accused pleaded guilty to read as follows:

> _MCN-902068-2017 (exhibit C3A)_

_4_ TH _CHARGE (AMENDED)_

> _You are charged that you, on 31 October 2016, at or about 10.37 am, at 178 Waterloo Street,Singapore, did commit mischief, to wit, by stepping on a walking stick valued at around $28/ belonging to one Zeng Guoyuan, causing the said walking stick to become bent and diminish in utility, with the intent to cause wrongful damage to the said Zeng Guoyuan, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 426 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## Statement of facts in respect of the mischief charge

4       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) in respect of the mischief charge without qualification. The SOF is also relevant in that it provides the backdrop for the s 182 charges. The SOF read as follows:

> _COMPLAINANT_

> _1_.     _The complainant is Inspector Paige Tan. She is an officer of the Singapore Police Force, attached to Central Police Divisional Headquarters as an Investigation Officer._

> _WITNESSES_

> _2_.     _The witnesses are:_

>> _a_)     _Zeng Guoyuan (“Zeng”), a 65-year-old male Singapore citizen (date of birth: 28 September 1953). He is unemployed._

>> _b_)     _Sergeant Durganivashini d/o Yogendran (“Sgt Durganivashini”). She is an officer of the Singapore Police Force, attached to Marina Bay Neighbourhood Police Centre._

> _ACCUSED_

> _3_.     _The accused is Seah Chin Peng, a 48-year-old male Singapore citizen bearing NRIC No. XXX (date of birth: 25 February 1971). At the material time, he was a Police Officer bearing the rank of Senior Staff Sergeant, attached to Marina Bay Neighbourhood Police Centre._

> _FIRST INFORMATION REPORT_

> _4_.     _On 14 November 2016, whilst investigating into a case of disorderly behaviour and using abusive language against a public servant allegedly committed on 31 October 2016 by Zeng, the complainant formed the suspicion that the accused had given false information relating to the arrest of Zeng. The matter was subsequently referred to the Internal Affairs Office of the Singapore Police Force to conduct investigations against the accused._

> _FACTS RELATING TO MCN-902068-2017_

> _5_.     _On 31 October 2016, at about 10.30 am, the accused and Sgt Durganivashini arrived outside the Kuan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple (“the temple”) at 178 Waterloo Street, Singapore (“the incident location”) in response to a 999 call from a caller. The text of message was, “A man wearing fully white, no nose, in wheelchair is begging and causing nuisance in front of the temple. He is always here. I cannot give my phone number”._

> _6_.     _At the incident location, the accused and Sgt Durganivashini spotted Zeng seated on a wheelchair under a big umbrella outside the temple. The accused approached Zeng and they began a conversation in Mandarin. The accused then saw Zeng holding a walking stick valued at $28/- and asked Zeng to let him take a look at it. Zeng handed the walking stick to the accused. The accused told Zeng that he may hurt people with the walking stick and it was not good for him to carry it. Zeng then stood up from his wheelchair and tried to retrieve the walking stick from the accused. The accused guided Zeng to sit back in his wheelchair and Zeng complied. The accused said again that it was dangerous for Zeng to carry the walking stick as Zeng might hurt someone with it._

> _7_.     _While he was in a seated position, Zeng asked for the walking stick back. The accused asked Zeng what Zeng would do if the accused refused. Zeng said when he walked with the walking stick there would be a sound. The accused then knocked the walking stick several times on the floor. He said, “This kind of sound?” before stepping hard on the walking stick with his right foot and causing it to become bent and diminish in utility. The accused did so with the intent to cause wrongful damage to Zeng. This was at 10.37 a.m. on 31 October 2016. The accused then said that he decided to damage the walking stick so that Zeng cannot use it to hurt people. This infuriated Zeng and he said “Fuck Off” and “Cheebye”._

> _8_.     _On hearing that, the accused asked Zeng a few times what Zeng had said. Zeng did not answer the question and told the accused not to disturb him or spoil his things. The accused subsequently placed Zeng under arrest for disorderly behaviour and using abusive language against a public servant._

> _9_.     _There was a crowd of members of the public in the vicinity at the material time._

> _10_.     _Zeng was then brought to the Central Police Divisional Headquarters for investigation. Ultimately, no further action was taken against him in respect of the incident on 31 October 2016._

> _11_.     _The entire incident was captured on the Body-worn Camera of Sgt Durgavashini._

> _12_.     _The accused has thereby committed an offence of mischief under section 426 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## Video Footages Captured on PW1’s Body-worn Camera and screenshots from the video footages

5       The video footages captured on PW1 Sgt Durganivashini’s Body-worn Camera (“BWC”) on 31 October 2016 between 10.30am and 10.45am and between 11.11am and 11.13am were played in court (exhibit 1). The footages captured what happened from the time the Accused arrived at the incident location with PW1, the accused’s interaction with Zeng and Zeng’s arrest. The footages also captured what happened during the time when the Accused was waiting by the side of the road whilst his fellow police officers were retrieving Zeng’s belongings from the incident location to be loaded into the Accused’s police car. The Prosecution also tendered exhibit P3 which was a compilation of the screenshots taken from the video footages.

## Undisputed facts in respect of the s 182 charges (the second and the third charges)

6       The facts leading to the s 182 charges were largely undisputed. I reproduce below the pertinent facts as succinctly summarised by the Prosecution in its Closing Submissions dated 17 May 2019 at \[11\] to \[13\] and \[17\] to \[20\] (paragraph numbering below mine).

> _The second charge_

> _1_.     _On 31 October 2016, PW3 Inspector Paige Tan (“Inspector Paige”) was on duty as the Assistant Investigation Officer at the \[Central\] Division of the Singapore Police Force._

> _2_.     _The accused called PW3 Inspector Paige in the afternoon that day to briefly inform her about the arrest of Zeng. PW3 Inspector Paige then asked the accused to provide her with a self-recorded statement. PW3 Inspector Paige explained that a Police officer would typically be directed to provide a self-recorded statement for clarification of the facts and to allow the Investigation Officer to have a greater understanding of what transpired. She also highlighted that the Police officer’s self-recorded statement would also be a form of “witness statement” to complete the investigations against the arrested party._

> _3_.     _On the same day, at about 5.30 pm, at the Police Cantonment Complex, the accused self-recorded his statement (“self-recorded statement”) which stated that:_

>> _While I was doing the check where he started to snatched the walking stick back and I keep it away from him. While I was trying to avoided him and I lost my balance and step onto the walking stick which causes it to break ..._

> _The third charge_

> _4_.     _On 3 November 2016 at about 12.03 pm, PW3 Inspector Paige contacted the accused and enquired about the whereabouts on Zeng’s walking stick since she realised it was not part of Zeng’s case property. The accused informed PW3 Inspector Paige that the walking stick had been thrown away by the members of the public and was no longer at the incident location when he returned to retrieve the walking stick._

> _5_.     _However, PW1 Sgt Durganivashini’s BWC captures Zeng’s walking stick being passed to the accused and the accused saying “this one throw”. The accused then placed the walking stick at the back of the Police car before the accused got into the driver’s seat of the said Police car._

> _6_.     _The Prosecution led evidence to show that the proper Police procedure was for all of the arrested subject’s properties to be brought back with the arrested subject and registered accordingly. During Cross-Examination, PW2 Sgt Zakariansar emphasised that it was not for the Police officers to decide to discard certain items, even if they were seemingly damaged: ….._

> …….

> 7.     _In this regard, the accused testified that he was familiar with Police procedure, including how to handle property and other standard operating procedures._

## Elements of an offence under s 182 of the PC

7       The Prosecution must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt for an offence under s 182 of the PC[^2]:

> 1)     That the accused person had given information to a public servant;

> 2)     That such information was false;

> 3)     That the accused person knew or believed that such information was false; and

> 4)     That the accused person intended or knew it to be likely that the information would be acted upon by the public servant in the manner contemplated by the provision.

## The issues before the court

8       The Defence did not dispute that the first two elements of both the s 182 charges had been fulfilled. There was no question that Accused had provided the information in the second and third charges to PW3 Inspector Paige who was a public servant. In respect of the second element, where the second charge was concerned, the Accused admitted that he had intentionally damaged Zeng’s walking stick. His act of mischief was also captured on the BWC of PW1 Sgt Durganivashini and could also be seen in the screenshot at exhibit P3 (s/n. 10). Therefore, the Accused’s self-recorded statement (exhibit P7) in which he stated that he had stepped on Zeng’s walking stick accidently was clearly false. Where the third charge was concerned, as could be seen from the video footages and the screenshots in exhibit P3 (s/n. 22 and 23), PW2 Sgt Zakarinasar had passed the walking stick to the Accused by the road side near the incident location and the Accused had in turn placed it in his police car. Hence what the Accused told PW3 Inspector Paige that the walking stick had been thrown away by members of the public and that it was no longer at the incident location when he returned to retrieve it was therefore also false.

9       The Prosecution’s case for the second and third charges was that the Accused knew at the time of giving both statements that they were false. The Defence disagreed. The case for the Defence was that the Accused had memory loss issues due to a stroke that he suffered in Feb 2016. As a result, he could not recall why he had stepped on the walking stick. Since it would contravene guidelines for an arresting officer to damage a subject’s property, the Accused inferred that the walking must have been accidentally broken. Further, since he was not able to find the walking stick, the logical inference would have been that it had been disposed of. Consequently, he provided the false statements based on his inferences. The Accused also stated that he was unaware that he had a mental condition that was affecting his memory retention and he only found out that his recollection was false when he watched the BWC.

10     Therefore, the main issues before the court pertained to elements (3) and (4) and they were as follows:

> 1)     In respect of the second charge, (i) whether the Accused knew at the time of his self-recorded statement in P7 that his claim that he had accidentally damaged Zeng’s walking stick was false and (ii) whether the Accused knew it to be likely that the information would thereby cause PW3 Inspector Paige to omit to investigate him for damaging the walking stick;

> 2)     In respect of the third charge, (i) whether the Accused knew at the time he told PW3 Inspector Paige on 3 Nov 2016 that the walking stick had been thrown away by members of the public and it was no longer at the incident location when he returned to retrieve it was false and (ii) whether the Accused knew it to be likely that the information would thereby cause PW3 Inspector Paige to omit to investigate him for damaging the walking stick.

## The Prosecution’s Case

### The second charge

11     The Prosecution’s case was that since the Accused had deliberately and intentionally damaged Zeng’s walking stick at 10.37am on 31 Oct 2016, it would follow that when he prepared his self-recorded statement mere hours later at 5.30pm that he knew he was giving false information when he stated that he had accidentally stepped on the walking stick. The Prosecution also submitted that it could be inferred that the Accused knew that he would thereby prevent PW3 Inspector Paige from commencing investigations against him for intentionally damaging the walking stick since the Accused was aware that his actions were not in accordance with proper procedure and that he would face negative consequences if found out[^3].

### The third charge

12     The Prosecution’s case was that since the Accused was the one who had received the walking stick from PW2 Sgt Zakarinasar and since he was also the one who had placed it at the back of his police car on 31 Oct 2016, there was no reason why the Accused would not remember it. Therefore, he knew that he was providing false information to PW3 Inspector Paige on 3 Nov 2016. The Prosecution also argued that the Accused had a motive to lie that Zeng’s walking stick could not be recovered because it constituted evidence of his improper conduct in intentionally damaging it. The Prosecution also submitted that the Accused revealed his plan to discard the walking stick as evidence when he commented to PW2 Sgt Zakarinasar “this one throw” upon receiving the walking stick from PW2 Sgt Zakarinasar. The Prosecution also submitted that it could be inferred that the Accused knew that by not including the walking stick in the case exhibits and giving PW3 Inspector Paige the false information that the walking stick could not be recovered, he would likely cause PW3 to omit to investigate his conduct further.

## Case for the Defence

### Evidence of the Accused (DW1)

13     The Accused testified that he had been with the Singapore Police Force since 1994 until 2016 when he was suspended from duty due to this case. During his career, he had received numerous commendations. He suffered a stroke in Feb 2016 whilst on overseas holiday and once he reached Singapore, he was admitted to hospital for 4 days and subsequently given 2 weeks’ medical leave. He was then certified fit for frontline duty as part of the Fast Response Ground Crew where he was the group leader of his team. Every 3 months, he was to go to the Polyclinic for follow-up.

14     After his stroke, although the Accused was able to cope with the normal day-to-day routine, he would sometimes experience difficulty in recalling what had just happened and it would also take him a longer time to recall things. He noticed it slowly, one or two months later. It was initially not a concern because he was only forgetful about where he had placed his things and his colleagues, friends and wife had to remind him. There were times when he could not recall conversations he just had with say his wife half an hour ago. As a result of his stroke, he also underwent mood change. He would get agitated easily over small matters at home. At work, he was not always able to control his mood so he would step away from the crowd and questioned himself repeatedly “why are I doing this?”

15     With regards to 31 Oct 2016, when the Accused was deployed to the scene with PW1 Sgt Durganivashini to attend to a case of nuisance, he knew that the subject involved was Zeng as Zeng was a familiar character and “ranked” as “a person of interest”. The Accused had also dealt with Zeng on numerous occasions before. The Accused knew that Zeng had previously injured people with his walking stick as the Accused had personally handled Zeng’s cases on 2 or 3 occasions. As to why the Accused had stepped on Zeng’s walking stick thereby damaging it, the Accused told the court that frankly he did not know the reason why he did that and he would not be able to elaborate on it.

16     The Accused testified that during the arrest, as Zeng refused to stand up, the Accused was unable to handcuff Zeng behind his back so he had to handcuff Zeng to the wheelchair and pushed the wheelchair to where his colleagues were waiting with their vehicle at the side of the road to transport Zeng back to Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”). The Accused then went to collect his police car from the carpark and drove it to the side of the road near the incident location so that Zeng’s wheelchair and the items hanging on it could be loaded into his police car. The Accused also walked back and forth to the incident location three times to retrieve Zeng’s altar and the rest of Zeng’s belongings but he did not see the walking stick so he surmised that the cleaner had cleared the walking stick. He said that was the reason why when he called the investigator ie PW3 Inspector Paige, he told her that the walking stick might have been thrown away by the cleaner. The Accused also clarified that he called PW3 Inspector Paige when he was still at the scene, after Zeng had been placed into his colleague’s vehicle. His purpose was to brief PW3 Inspector Paige on Zeng’s arrest to prepare PW3 for Zeng’s arrival at PCC. The Accused also told the court that he informed PW3 Inspector Paige when he called her that he might have accidentally stepped on the walking stick because he was “trying to avoid \[Zeng\] from taking” it. PW3 Inspector Paige instructed the Accused to bring Zeng back and for the Accused to provide a statement. Subsequently, PW2 Zakarinasar passed the Accused the walking stick, which the Accused placed inside his police car.

17     On 31 Oct 2016, due to Zeng’s medical condition, the lock-up initially rejected his registration and the Accused and three other colleagues had to fetch Zeng to Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) for check-up to certify Zeng’s fitness. The process took three to four hours, as there were two to three trips up and down before the lock-up’s criteria were met. Finally, the lock-up took over custody of Zeng in the late afternoon. It was at that point of time that the Accused prepared his self-statement (exhibit P7) at 5.30pm. From what he could recall, he recorded in his statement how Zeng’s arrest came about, his observations and the cause for the walking stick “being bent”. The Accused told the court that he did not have the luxury of time to view his BWC footages when he was recording his self-statement neither did he check his statement with his partner PW1 Sgt Durganivashini.

18     When PW3 Inspector Paige called the Accused and asked him regarding the whereabouts of the walking stick, the Accused told her that it might have been thrown away. Subsequently, PW3 Inspector Paige told the Accused to go down for a further statement during which she showed him the BWC footages. Upon watching the footages, the Accused realised what he had done and admitted that he had actually stepped on the walking stick and “spoilt” it. PW3 Inspector Paige only showed the Accused the part of the footage where he was captured stepping on the walking stick. PW3 Inspector Paige did not show the Accused the footage where PW2 Zakarinasar handed over the walking stick to the Accused at the scene. PW4 IO Jalil showed the Accused the footage where the Accused received the walking stick from PW2 Zakarinasar. At that time, the Accused explained to PW4 IO Jalil that the discrepancies in his initial statement were based on his recollection. The Accused also explained that when he commented “this one throw” around the time when PW2 Zakarinasar handed him the walking stick, he was not referring to the walking stick. There were other colleagues present then who were not captured in the footages and one of them might have been asking him whether a piece of paper or perhaps some other rubbish belonged to Zeng and the Accused might have been replying to that colleague “this one throw”.

### Evidence of Dr Elaine Tan (DW2)

19     DW2 Dr Elaine Tan, a consultant family physician, attended to the Accused for the first time at Hougang Polyclinic on 28 Sep 2016. During the session, the Accused gave Dr Tan a memo from the National Neuroscience Institute (“NNI”). He had visited NNI the day before and the neurologist had issued the memo for the purpose of the Accused’s follow up at the Polyclinic for management of his chronic illnesses like diabetes and high cholesterol. According to Dr Tan, the memo stated that the Accused had a Transient Ischemic Attack (“TIA”) which occurred in Feb 2016 and that NNI had started the Accused on aspirin as part of his TIA treatment. Dr Tan explained that TIA occurred when there was actual impairment circulation to the brain resulting in a temporary loss of neurological function but TIA was usually reversible and aspirin would help to prevent clots from forming. Once a person experienced TIA, the medical concern was that there might be a recurrence, which could result in a stroke. Dr Tan also clarified that according to the neurologist, what the Accused suffered from was not a stroke but a TIA. Dr Tan also told the court that she did not document any mention of memory loss raised by the Accused.

## Evaluation of the evidence and findings

### Second Charge

### (1)   Did the Accused know at the time of his self-recorded statement in P7 that his claim that he had accidentally damaged Zeng’s walking stick was false?

20     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused knew at the time of making his self-recorded statement that the assertion of accidental damage was false. It contended that since the Accused provided the information in P7 a mere couple of hours after he had deliberately and intentionally damaged Zeng’s walking stick, it would ordinarily follow that he knew he was giving false information. The Prosecution also submitted that the Accused’s defence of memory loss arising after his TIA ought to be rejected because it was an afterthought.

21     I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused knew at the time of his self-recorded statement in P7 that his claim that he had accidentally damaged the walking stick was false for the following reasons:

> 1)     There was no medical report to support the Accused’s claim of memory loss. According to the Accused, he was certified fit for duty after the initial 2 weeks’ medical leave. He only saw a specialist regarding his purported memory loss in January 2018, almost 2 years after his TIA in Feb 2016 and more than one year after the offences dates in Oct/Nov 2016. Notwithstanding his belated medical consultation, the Accused did not call the specialist as a witness. DW2 Dr Tan from the Polyclinic whom the Accused saw for his follow up also did not document that the Accused complained of memory loss issues.

> 2)     The Accused also failed to call as witnesses his family members and friends who could have easily substantiated his claim of forgetfulness.

> 3)     The Accused did not raise his memory loss issue arising from his TIA when PW3 Inspector Paige first interviewed him on 16 Nov 2016 during the recording of his statement in exhibit P4. His explanation at \[8\] of P4 was that it was a busy shift on 31 Oct 2016 and therefore he “did not manage to provide a full recollection of the incident” involving Zeng’s walking stick.

> 4)     At the material time, PW1 Sgt Durganivashini, had worked with the Accused as his partner for about a month or less. She observed that the Accused had shown tendencies of forgetfulness and absentmindedness, for instance, forgetting to go to places that they were supposed to visit as part of their duty or being late in going to these places. But she clarified that the things that the Accused was forgetful about did not extend to significant events such as intentionally breaking or damaging an arrested person’s property. She also could not recall any occasion where he had forgotten a significant event. On the contrary, from her knowledge and experience working with the Accused, it was her understanding that the Accused knew and remembered the police procedures. Therefore, PW1’s evidence in this regard did not help to advance the Accused’s defence that he was suffering from memory loss issues due to his TIA.

> 5)     I also agreed with the Prosecution that it was evident from the contents of the Accused’s self-recorded statement in exhibit P7 that he had “retained the ability” to give a fairly accurate and detailed account of the events on 31 Oct 2016. Despite the rush for time, the Accused was able to recall his encounter with Zeng in great detail except when it came to how Zeng’s walking stick was damaged. This was the part which was adverse to the Accused. Given that the Accused had no difficulty recalling the rest of his encounter with Zeng, I was not persuaded that it was due to his faulty memory that he had recounted the wrong facts in P7. I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that it was all too convenient for the Accused to remember everything except for that one detail that would get him into trouble namely that he had intentionally damaged Zeng’s walking stick. I believed that the Accused had knowingly lied in P7 in order to evade the repercussions.

> 6)     I further agreed with the Prosecution that when the Accused gave evidence during the trial, he had no difficulty recalling the year that he joined the Singapore Police Force, the date that he was suspended and the commendations he had received in his career. He could even recall one instance where he got into trouble for speeding because he pursued a suspect in a stolen car. He also recounted with ease the circumstances relating to Zeng’s arrest and how he recorded P7. As such, it was hard to believe that he could not recall something as major as the fact that he had intentionally damaged Zeng’s walking stick.

### (2)   Did the Accused know it to be likely that he would thereby cause PW3 Inspector Paige to omit to investigate him for damaging the walking stick?

22     The Accused admitted that he would face negative consequences if it were found out that he had intentionally damaged Zeng’s walking stick. Therefore, I agreed that it could be inferred that when he falsely stated in P7 that he had accidentally damaged the walking stick, he knew that this would cause PW3 Inspector Paige to omit from investigating him for committing mischief, which PW3 ought not to have omitted if she had known the true state of facts.

### Third Charge

### (1)   Did the Accused know at the time he told PW3 Inspector Paige on 3 Nov 2016 that the walking stick had been thrown away by members of the public and it was no longer at the incident location when he returned to retrieve it was false?

23     I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused knew that he was providing false information when he told PW3 Inspector Paige on 3 Nov 2016 that the walking stick had been thrown away by members of the public and it was no longer at the incident location when he returned to retrieve it for the following reasons.

> 1)     The Accused took over the walking stick from PW2 Sgt Zakariansar at the scene and there was no reason why he would not remember it when the walking stick had featured prominently during Zeng’s arrest. In this regard, I have explained above why I rejected the Accused’s defence that he was suffering from memory loss arising from his TIA.

> 2)     I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that the damaged walking stick constituted incriminating evidence against the Accused and he had a motive to get rid of the evidence. I agreed that he revealed his intention to dispose of the walking stick when he told PW2 Sgt Zakariansar “this one throw”. In this regard, I did not believe the Accused’s version that when he said “this one throw”, he was actually replying to his colleague, PW5 SSSgt Habeebulla, who was asking him whether some “rubbish” belonged to Zeng. SSSgt Habeebulla was called as a rebuttal witness. He testified that he and his partner had heeded to the Accused’s call for help to escort Zeng to PCC. They had left the incident location with Zeng in their vehicle and were no longer present when PW2 Sgt Zakariansar handed the walking stick to the Accused. PW2 Sgt Zakariansar who was also recalled as a rebuttal witness also confirmed that when he passed Zeng’s walking stick to the Accused, PW5 SSSgt Habeebulla had already driven off. In the circumstances, the Accused was clearly referring to Zeng’s walking stick when he said, “this one throw”.

> 3)     The Accused also suggested that the walking stick might have been mixed up with Zeng’s “rubbish” such as rotten fruits which were not allowed into the lock-up and inadvertently thrown away. I agreed with the Prosecution that this was an unlikely scenario given the size and unique shape of the walking stick. I also agreed that even if the Accused had mistakenly discarded the walking stick, it would still mean that he knew it was a lie when he told PW3 Inspector Paige that the walking stick had been thrown away by members of the public and it was no longer at the incident location when he returned to retrieve it.

### (2)   Did the Accused know it to be likely that he would thereby cause PW3 Inspector Paige to omit to investigate him for damaging the walking stick?

24     The Accused knew the implications of his action in deliberately damaging Zeng’s walking stick. I agreed with the Prosecution that it could be inferred that he was aware that by removing the walking stick as an exhibit and giving PW3 Inspector Paige false information that it could not be recovered from the scene that he would thereby cause PW3 to omit to investigate him further.

## Conclusion

25     In conclusion, while the Accused claimed that he had a medical basis for unknowingly giving the false information in the s 182 charges, he had not adduced any medical evidence to support his assertions. On the contrary, the evidence showed that he not only remembered the events on 31 Oct 2016 and 3 Nov 2016 well he also had a motive to lie in order to cover up his misdeed. On the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved the s 182 charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I therefore convicted him accordingly.

## Antecedents

26     The Accused was a first offender.

## Prescribed punishments for s 182 charges and the mischief charge

27     The punishment prescribed for a s 182 charge is an imprisonment term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to $5000 or with both. The punishment prescribed for a mischief charge under section 426 of the Penal Code is an imprisonment term of up to one year or with fine or with both.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

28     The Prosecution submitted for at least 4 months’ imprisonment per charge for the s 182 charges with the sentences to run concurrently. In doing so, it relied on the sentencing principles laid down in the three-judge High Court decision in _Koh Yong Chiah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 447</span> (“_Koh Yong Chiah_”) for offences under s 182 of the Penal Code. The Prosecution also argued that general deterrence was the overriding sentencing consideration and that a custodial sentence was warranted. The main reasons put forward by the Prosecution may be summarised as follows:

> 1)     As an experienced law enforcement officer, the Accused’s duty was to uphold the law but instead he broke the law by committing mischief against the elderly Zeng in public view and then tried to conceal his crime by lying to the police in order to subvert the course of justice;

> 2)     The offences undermined public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system as any untruths uttered by a police officer in the performance of his law enforcement duties would invariably have serious implications on the rights and liberties of subjects being investigated;

> 3)     The Accused had breached the trust reposed in him by the State and risked tarnishing the hard-won reputation of the Government and the Singapore Police Force;

> 4)     Appreciable harm had been caused because the Accused was attempting to cover up a serious predicate offence which was his “gratuitous mistreatment” of Zeng;

> 5)     The Accused had provided the false information in connection with the performance of his official duties, in a statement that he was required to furnish as part of his official duties and later in relation to direct questioning by his superior;

> 6)     Actual harm was caused in that investigative resources were wasted as a result of the falsehood;

> 7)     The Accused also knew and did not merely believe that the information he gave was false on both occasions and this was a culpability enhancing factor in _Koh Yong Chiah_;

> 8)     The offences were pre-meditated since they were not committed at the spur of the moment but the Accused would have had time to think over what he was going to state. This was also a culpability enhancing factor under _Koh Yong Chiah_.

> 9)     There was no substantial mitigating factors present.

29     The Prosecution also tendered two sentencing precedents under s 182 Penal Code for the court’s consideration. One was the case of _PP v Low Vins_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 6</span>. _Low Vins_ was a CNB investigation officer who falsely told his supervisor that he had visited two drug offenders but they were not at home. Consequently, the drug offenders were prosecuted in court for absconding and they were also deprived of the option of being sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre. _Low Vins_ claimed trial and was convicted and sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for each charge with both sentences to run concurrently. His sentence was upheld on appeal. _Low Vins_ had committed the offences out of laziness to conduct the house visits. The Prosecution submitted that even though there was actual harm caused in _Low Vins_ in that the drug offenders were charged in court, a higher sentence was justified in the present case because the Accused was more culpable. Furthermore, _Low Vins_ was only 24 years old and 7 months in his job in CNB as compared with the Accused, a senior and experienced police officer.

30     The second precedent that the Prosecution cited was _PP v Charan Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 180</span>. _Charan Singh_ was an LTA senior investigation officer. LTA was about to auction off some motorcycles to recover road tax arrears. _Charan Singh_ gave false information to his supervisor that the road tax arrears had been paid for four motorcycles so as to cause his supervisor to agree to withdraw the motorcycles from auction. _Charan Singh_ was convicted after trial and sentenced to four week’s imprisonment. He was given a sentencing discount on the ground that the investigations had started 7 years ago. His appeal was dismissed. The Prosecution submitted that the punishment prescribed then was an imprisonment term of up to six months, a fine of up to $1000 or both which was lower than the current prescribed punishment. It argued that a more severe sentence would likely be imposed if a similar case were to be sentenced today. Since the present case was more serious in nature due to the greater degree of harm, a higher sentence than four weeks’ imprisonment would be justified.

31     The Prosecution did not make any sentencing submissions for the mischief charge and left sentencing to the court.

## Mitigation

32     The Defence submitted for a fine for all three charges on the ground of the Accused’s “newly discovered state of health”. It also tendered medical reports and memos which were not adduced during the trial to show that the Accused had obtained further medical attention after the incidents in the second and third charges and he was found to be suffering from gradual cognitive impairment.

33     The Defence also argued that under the guidelines of _Koh Yong Chiah_, the custodial threshold had only been crossed minimally and that the Accused should be given leniency for the following reasons:

> 1)     Although the Accused had provided information that was false, the harm was minimal as the Accused’s statements and reports in relation to the incident were not entirely untrue. The falsehood only pertained to investigations against himself rather than to Zeng’s liability and liberty.

> 2)     There was no premeditation as the false information was provided spontaneously. The Accused had apologised for his error as soon as he was shown the BWC footage.

> 3)     The Accused maintained that he was unaware at all material times that he had provided false information. He strongly believed that what he had stated was the true sequence of events. Further he was the one who had broached the issue of the walking stick voluntarily with PW3 Inspector Paige during which he informed her that he might have accidentally stepped on it as he was trying to avoid Zeng which then turned the spotlight on him.

> 4)     The Accused did not perpetuate the deception but had assisted PW3 Inspector Paige fully in the investigations.

> 5)     The Accused was not trying to avoid prosecution of his actions. Had it not been for his deteriorating health, he would have admitted to his mistakes as soon as possible. In fact he did recant his statements once he was shown the footages.

> 6)     The Accused understood the integrity of his duties as a police officer, both to the citizens as well as to the force. He had claimed trial to prove that he was suffering from cognitive impairments at the time of the offence and that his actions were truly out of character.

> 7)     The statements that he had provided involved his actions and would not have implicated Zeng or the members of the public in any way.

> 8)     The Accused was remorseful that investigative resources had to be expended for him to realise that he had an issue with cognitive abilities.

> 9)     An imprisonment term would effectively end his career in the Singapore Police Force and having been in service for 25 years, the Police Force was the only way of life he knew. He was proud of the service and had been dedicated to his job. He had also been a law abiding citizen and dutiful public servant all these years.

## Sentencing considerations for the s 182 charges

34     The three-judge High Court in _Koh Yong Chiah_ laid down some broad guidelines as to the kind of cases that would generally attract a custodial sentence as a starting point for s 182 PC offences. It held that if appreciable harm may be caused, the courts should, as a starting point, impose an imprisonment term. It further stated at \[51\] that the harm must be causally connected to the provision of the false information, more than de minimis, includes both actual and potential harm and the duration of the falsehood is also relevant. The High Court also identified a non-exhaustive set of factors which could affect the level of culpability and harm and these factors would be relevant to determine if the starting point should be departed from and/or what the appropriate fine or imprisonment should be.

35     I agreed with the Prosecution that general deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration and that the starting point in the present case would be a custodial term. In this regard, I accepted the Prosecution’s sentencing submissions[^4]. I highlight below some of the main sentencing considerations and aggravating factors that I took into account:

> 1)     Appreciable harm was caused because the Accused had provided the false information in order to avoid the rightful consequences that might ensue by reason of him abusing his authority as a police officer in mistreating Zeng.

> 2)     The false information was given by the Accused in his capacity as a public servant in relation to his own duties in order to deceive other public servants;

> 3)     Actual harm was also caused in that investigative resources were expanded and wasted due to the Accused’s lies.

> 4)     The Accused knew that the information he provided was false as opposed to merely having reason to believe.

> 5)     The offences were clearly pre-meditated and not committed on the spur of the moment;

> 6)     The Accused only admitted to what he had done when he was confronted with the BWC footage on 16 Nov 2016.

36     In sentencing the Accused, I also took into account the fact that he was a first offender. Aside from that, there were no real mitigating factors. Insofar as his medical condition was concerned, in particular the diagnosis that the Accused was suffering from “mild cognitive impairment”, it would be noted that the Defence only tendered the medical reports during mitigation. None of these documents which were relevant to the issue of whether the Accused suffered from any memory loss issues arising from his TIA were tendered during the trial. I therefore attached little if no weight to the documents.

37     Having regard to the circumstances of the case, the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors as well as the precedents tendered, I was of the view that 3 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the second charge. As the Accused went on to commit yet another s 182 offence in the third charge three days later, I was of the view that a higher sentence was warranted for this charge and I imposed four month’ imprisonment. Given the close proximity of these two offences, I ordered them to run concurrently.

## Sentencing considerations for the mischief charge

38     The Prosecution left sentencing for the mischief charge to the court while the Defence submitted for a fine. In sentencing the Accused for the mischief charge, I was guided by the commentaries of the editors in the Practitioner’s Library – Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, 3rd Edition, LexisNexis 2013 at pages 947 to 948:

> “_The variety of ways in which the offence may be committed can be seen in the provisions of ss 425, 426 to 440, which range from simple mischief to mischief involving the use of fire or any explosive substance. The most common prosecutions in this category of offences are those under ss 426 and 427._

> _As the offences under ss 426 and 427 can be committed in a wide range of situations, the sentencing disposition would inevitably turn on the unique circumstances of each case and of the offender. …._

> _Where there are no aggravating or mitigating factors, the usual sentence imposed is a fine. Such a sentence will usually be imposed where the damage caused to the property is not extensive and is easily reversible. This may also be the case where the loss suffered in monetary terms is small. Significant considerations affecting the sentencing disposition would include the loss in monetary terms suffered by the complainant as a result of the offence, whether the offender acted impulsively or with premeditation, the likelihood or risk of personal injury arising from the offence, circumstances of the mischief, age of the offender, prevalence of the offence, the extensiveness and irreversibility of the damage and the offender’s criminal record (especially concerning property offences)._

> _Where some aspect of public interest is engaged, more severe sentences (including custody) have also been imposed. For example, where the offence was committed in the ‘road rage’ context, the courts have imposed a sentence of imprisonment as a general deterrent; ……._

> _The courts have also treated more severely cases where the damage had been pre-meditated and caused deliberately, as opposed to damage caused as a result of impulsive action; see PP v Tan Ming Shung (MA 74/04), Ngow Pui Fong Davinia v Heng Siew Inn Rosalind <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGMC 3</span>. In Ngow Pui Fong Davinia v Heng Siew Inn Rosalind (above), the judge specifically considered the principle of specific deterrence in relation to an offence which was committed with maliciousness, and imposed a sentence of one day’s imprisonment in addition to a fine of $2,000. On the other hand, where the offender has shown remorse or has offered to make compensation, the courts will treat these as valid mitigating factors;”_

39     Ordinarily, given that the value of Zeng’s walking stick was small ($28) and that the Accused was willing to make full compensation for the damage, in the absence of any aggravating factors, a fine would have been an appropriate sentence. In this regard, the issue of compensation only arose at the conclusion of the trial when the Accused decided to plead guilty to the mischief charge. At the time of sentencing, the Prosecution informed the court that the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) had already compensated Zeng for the walking stick on 19 April 2017 and that internally SPF was still checking if it was in a position to receive reimbursement from the Accused. The Prosecution also informed the Defence that should SPF be permitted to accept compensation from the Accused, that he could proceed to do so even after the case.

40     I was of the view that a fine would not be an adequate punishment for the following reasons:

> 1)     This case involved public interest. The Accused’s duty as a police officer was to uphold the law. It was aggravating that he had deliberately broken the law by maliciously damaging Zeng’s walking stick, when Zeng had done nothing to necessitate any such measure;

> 2)     It was also aggravating that the Accused had blatantly carried out his unlawful act in full public view and in the presence of his fellow colleague, PW1 Sgt Durganivashini;

> 3)     Deterrence would be the primary sentencing consideration here and a fine would send the wrong signal that a law enforcement officer could get away lightly despite having brazenly violated a citizen’s right and undermining the integrity of the SPF.

> 4)     The custodial threshold had clearly been crossed and the imprisonment term must be of sufficient length to achieve a deterrent effect.

41     In the circumstances, I thought it would be appropriate to sentence the Accused to 2 weeks’ imprisonment for the mischief charge.

42     S 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68 provided that where at one trial, a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court must order at least 2 of those offences to run consecutively. Therefore, I ordered the sentences for the third charge (ie 4 months’ imprisonment) and the mischief charge (ie 2 weeks’ imprisonment) to run consecutively. The Accused’s global sentence is 4 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment. His sentence has been stayed and the Accused is on bail pending appeal.
