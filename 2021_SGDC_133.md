Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9151/2021/01.\]

26 July 2021

### District Judge Ow Yong Tuck Leong:

1       The accused, Leong Kiat Hoe, a 25-year-old male, pleaded guilty to the charge reproduced below:

>      DAC-904530-2020

>     “You…Leong Kiat Hoe…are charged that you, between about 14 and 22 March 2019, in Singapore, did abet the offence punishable under section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap.50A) by engaging in a conspiracy with Koh Zhi Wei, Chua Wen Tat and one “Ben” to knowingly cause a computer to perform a function for the purpose of securing access without authority to data held in the credit card payment network of Visa and Mastercard, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to commit the said offence, you transferred photographs of 5 credit cards to Koh Zhi Wei, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3(1) read with 10(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap.50A).”

2       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly. I sentenced the accused to 5 months’ imprisonment. I set out the grounds of my decision below.

### Statement of Facts

3       The SOF relating to the commission of the offence is reproduced below:

> 1.    The accused is Leong Kiat Hoe, Male/25 years old… NRIC No. At the material time, he was working as a bartender at a nightclub called “Bar Thirty-One” located at #05-21/22 Bugis Cube, 470 North Bridge Road, Singapore. In the course of his work, he received credit cards from customers and processed the customers’ credit card payments at “Bar Thirty-One”. He also owned two debit cards, and used at least one of them to perform monetary transactions linked to his bank account.

>      **ACCOMPLICES**

> 2.    The accomplices are:

>> a.    Koh Zhi Wei (“Koh”).

>> b.    “Ben”, whose true identity has not been ascertained.

>> c.    Chua Wen Tat aka Mason (“Chua”). At the material time, he was Leong’s colleague and working as a waiter at “Bar Thirty-One.”

>      **EZ-LINK**

> 3.    EZ-Link Pte Ltd’s core business is in the sale, distribution and management of EZ-Link cards (stored value cards that can be used to make contactless payments for public transit, and other purchases and monetary transactions), as well as the clearing and settlement of all payment transactions using EZ-Link cards.

> 4.    EZ-Link cards could be topped up with stored value by accessing EZ-Link Pte Ltd’s computer network and using credit card information to do so.

> 5.    To top up the stored value of EZ-Link cards using credit card information, the user needed to key into EZ-Link Pte Ltd’s computer network credit card information which may be found on the two sides of the physical credit card, such as the cardholder’s name and the card number. When a user keyed in instructions to top up an EZ-Link card using card information of a particular credit card account, EZ-Link Pte Ltd’s computer network would (i) top up the stored value of the EZ-Link card; and (ii) secure access to the credit card payment computer network and charge the top-up value to the credit card account.

>      **FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC-904530-2020**

> 6.    Sometime between about 14 March 2019 and about 22 March 2019, Leong abetted by engaging in a conspiracy with Koh, “Ben” and Chua to commit the offence punishable under section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A).

> 7.    In pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to commit the said offence, the following acts took place. Koh asked Leong to send him credit card information belonging his customers, in exchange for money. Leong agreed, as he wanted to earn “quick money”. When Chua told Leong that he needed money, Leong asked Chua to assist him in this endeavour, in exchange for money. Together, on multiple occasions, they took digital photographs of the front and back of credit cards handed to them by their customers at “Bar Thirty-One” for payment processing. Leong would take the cards to the washroom to take the photographs. Chua took the photographs of one customer’s credit card, and sent the photographs to Leong via a text messaging application on his mobile phone. Leong then sent the photographs (which showed the credit card information on the face of the cards) to Koh via a text messaging application on his mobile phone. Leong knew that the credit card information would be used to perform unauthorised monetary transactions on the respective card accounts. As a result, he did not give his debit card details to Koh.

> 8.    In total, Leong sent photographs of 5 credit cards to Koh, without the cardholders’ authorisation. One of the credit cards had its photograph taken by Chua. Thereafter, Koh forwarded the said photographs to “Ben”. In return for sending Koh the photographs, Leong received from Koh $250. In turn, Leong gave Chua $50 for sending him the photographs of one credit card.

> 9.    After Koh sent “Ben” the photographs, “Ben” or his associates used the credit card information captured in the photographs of 3 of the aforementioned credit cards to top-up EZLink cards as per \[5\] above. In doing so without the authorisation of the credit card cardholders, they caused EZ-Link Pte Ltd’s computer network to perform a function for the purpose of securing access without authority to data held in the credit card payment computer networks of the 3 cards’ credit card service providers. The total value of the top-ups was $8,500. EZ-Link Pte Ltd was unable to recover the sum as the cardholders disputed ever performing the top-up transactions, since they were performed without their knowledge or authorisation.

> 10.    Out of the remaining 2 credit cards which photographs Leong had sent to Koh, “Ben” or his associates made multiple attempts to use the credit card information captured in the photographs of 1 of them to top up EZ-Link cards with value totalling $520. However, the transactions were unsuccessful.

> 11.    Leong stopped taking photographs of customers’ credit cards, and told Chua to follow suit, when Koh told him to stop doing so. At Koh’s instructions, Leong deleted from his mobile phone his chat history with Koh and Chua (containing the photographs and related text messages with Koh). Leong also told Chua to do the same with his mobile phone. This was done to destroy evidence of what they had done with the credit cards. However, investigations led to the retrieval of the photographs from Leong’s mobile phone.

> 12.    By virtue of the foregoing, sometime between about 14 March 2019 and about 22 March 2019, in Singapore, Leong abetted the offence punishable under section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act by engaging in a conspiracy with Koh, Chua and “Ben” to knowingly cause a computer, to wit, EZ-Link Pte Ltd’s computer network, to perform a function for the purpose of securing access without authority to data held in the credit card payment network of Visa and Mastercard. In pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to commit the said offence, Leong transferred photographs of 5 credit cards to Koh. Leong has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3(1) read with section 10(1) of the Computer Misuse Act.

#### Prescribed Penalties

4       The prescribed punishment for the charge under the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CMA”) is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

#### Antecedents

5       The accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

6       The Prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence was at least 6 months’ imprisonment. The dominant sentencing principles in this case were the principles of general deterrence and retribution. In support of this submission, the Prosecution relied on _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ \[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 84 (“_Law Aik Meng_”) (at \[24(e)\] and \[25(b)\]), and applied the sentencing considerations in _Law Aik Meng_ (at \[41\] to \[42\])_._

7       The offence targeted the delivery of financial services. The use of credit card facilities was ubiquitous and essential to a vibrant economy in today’s society. Ensuring the integrity of the credit card payment systems used in Singapore was a vital public interest for Singapore.

8       The offence was committed as part of a syndicated operation to use ‘stolen’ credit card details to top up EZ-Link cards, thereby enriching themselves at the expense of EZ-Link Pte Ltd or the credit card holders. The offence was premeditated, pursuant to the arrangement with Koh, and committed for financial gain. The accused attempted to destroy evidence of his offences in his mobile phone and instructed co-conspirator Chua to do the same.

9       A significant aggravating factor was the accused was not a mere participant in the syndicate. He was a recruiter of Chua to obtain more credit card details from the customers. In so doing, the accused expanded the web and reach of the syndicate, which enabled the syndicate to obtain more credit card details than it otherwise would have.

10     The financial loss caused by the offence was significant. EZ-Link Pte Ltd suffered a total loss of $8,500 from topping up EZ-Link cards with no means of recovery. Alarm and inconvenience in disputing the transactions was caused to 3 credit card holders. The accused did not cause the loss alone. He played a crucial role in causing the loss when he provided the credit card details to the syndicate. The accused also benefited financially. He received $250 from Koh and gave $50 to Chua.

11     There was a need for the courts to strongly denounce such activities which seem to have gained traction with people working in the service industry. In total, Koh had recruited three waiters or bartenders, including the accused, who in turn recruited one colleague each to obtain photographs of their customers’ credit cards. The accused had breached the trust of his customers by ‘stealing’ their credit card details. A clear deterrent message must be sent by the courts that even though it seems to be “easy money” to take photographs and pass them on, the privacy of credit card information must be protected especially by the people to whom the information has been entrusted.

12     The potential harm caused by the accused was high as the accused had ‘stolen’ and passed on 5 credit cards’ photographs, one of which was provided to the accused by Chua. The more credit cards were ‘stolen’ for the syndicate, the more resources the syndicate had to perpetuate their scams. The credit card details could also be used for other unauthorised transactions. The potential loss could have been as high as the credit limits for those 5 cards.

13     The mitigatory weight of the accused’s plea of guilt was attenuated as the photographs of the credit cards were retrieved from the accused’s mobile phone and he had no choice but to plead guilty.

14     The Prosecution referred to several cases as sentencing precedents. In the case of _Public Prosecutor v Karthik Sankar_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 54</span>, the offender aged 25-years-old was untraced and pleaded guilty to one charge under s3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CMCA”) and one charge of cheating under s420 of the Penal Code. Three charges of s420 of the Penal Code and one charge under s3(1) CMCA were taken into consideration for sentencing.

15     The offender worked as a bartender in a nightclub and asked a waitress at the nightclub to copy the details of credit cards belonging to the nightclub’s customers and pass the details to him so that they could be sold and the proceeds split between them. The offender managed to sell the credit card details obtained in this manner for between $20 and $40 per credit card. The offender transferred these credit card details (24 cards) onto his laptop. Using the credit card details of one of the credit cards, the offender purchased flight tickets for him and his girlfriend ($638) which formed the basis of the proceeded s420 of the Penal Code charge.

16     In relation to the CMCA charge, the victim was the boyfriend of the offender’s friend. The offender chanced upon the victim’s wallet at a chalet and took photographs of the victim’s debit card. The offender later used the debit card details to make purchases totalling $1,228.40. This offence was committed whilst on police bail. The total loss (including charges taken into consideration) was $3,056.28. The offender made full restitution. The District Court imposed a sentence of two months’ imprisonment for each proceeded charge; both ran consecutively for a global sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment. The offender filed an appeal against the sentence but failed to file a Petition of Appeal.

17     In the case of _Public Prosecution_ v Thio Ying Han (DAC-905173-2020 & Ors), the offender aged 24-years-old, was another member of the same syndicate but acted separately from the accused. He was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for one charge under s3(1) read with s10(1) of the CMA involving $95,690. One charge under s420 of the Penal Code was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

18     In relation to the CMA charge, Thio acted under Koh’s instructions to send him photographs of 18 of his customers’ credit cards. Thio had also recruited one Niccol Soon, who played the same role as Chua in this case. In return, Thio received from Koh, EZ-Link cards containing total stored value of $700 to $2,600, and used them to buy cigarettes, food, and drinks. He then resold the cigarettes to earn $1,800 to $2,600 and gave $400 to Soon. The Prosecution submitted that bearing in mind the principles of parity, and considering Thio’s increased criminality, a custodial sentence of 6 months was appropriate for the present accused.

### Mitigation

19     In his Mitigation Plea, counsel for the Defence said the accused was deeply remorseful for his actions. Counsel submitted that a probation report ought to be called so that it can be assessed as to whether probation would be suitable in the present case. In support of this submission, counsel relied on the High Court’s decision on the imposition of probation in _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 1412</span> (“_Terence Siow_”) at \[42\].

20     The present accused had turned 23 at the time of the offence and he had demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, under the High Court’s three-limbed framework in _Terence Siow_ at \[52\].

21     First, the accused had demonstrated a positive desire to change since the commission of the offence. He had not re-offended since the offence for a period of more than two years. He had engaged in frequent volunteer work. He had continued his studies and completed his diploma. He was gainfully employed. Crucially, the accused’s propensity for reform was verified by third parties from the charitable organisation, and their assessment was that his risk of re-offending was low. Second, the offender’s environment was conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf. The accused had the familial support of his family and the support of his fiancé, and an external support system of fellow volunteers and colleagues. Third, there were no risk factors in the present case such as the offender’s association with negative peers, or presence of bad habits such as habitual drug use or dependence. Rather, the accused had demonstrated that he had kept good company and habits that lower his risk of reoffending.

22     For the same reasons as set out above, counsel submitted that it would be appropriate to call for a day reporting order (“DRO”) (pursuant to s341(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) and/or community service order (“CSO”) (pursuant to s346(3) of the CPC) report. If necessary, a DRO or CSO may be coupled with the imposition of a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) pursuant to s348 of the CPC, which would serve as an appropriate deterrent sentence.

23     In support of this submission, counsel relied on the High Court’s decision in _Public Prosecutor v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 315</span> at (\[15\]-\[17\]) (“_Teo Chiang Heng_”) where the High Court dismissed the Prosecution’s appeal against the SDO sentence. Counsel also referred the court to the SDO sentence in _Public Prosecutor v Malvin Ng Yi Lun_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 225</span> (“_Malvin Ng Yi Lun_”). In that case, the offender had pleaded guilty to two counts of theft, both of which were committed in furtherance of the common intention with the offender’s mother, punishable under s379 read with s34 of the Penal Code.

24     In any event, counsel submitted that any custodial sentence should not exceed one month’s imprisonment, in consideration of the accused’s low level of culpability and strong propensity for reform. It would cause severe hardship to the accused’s family and may undo the significant progress which the accused had made since the commission of the offence.

25     The accused only sent photographs of five credit cards to Koh and earned only $200. It was Chua who approached the accused to ask how to earn fast money. There was no international dimension in the present case. It could not be said that the accused was a member of a syndicate, as was the case in _K Saravanan Kuppusamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 88</span> (see \[9\], \[28\]). Even if the accused was considered to have been a part of a syndicate, this should not be considered a significant aggravating factor: see _Public Prosecutor v Adri Anton Kalangie_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 217</span> at \[35\].

### Court’s Decision

#### Probation

26     It was not disputed by the parties that the imposition of probation for adult offenders was the exception, and that this required the adult offender to demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform or there existed exceptional circumstances. Even if the adult offender demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform, the significance of rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration may be displaced by the need for deterrence and even retribution because of the seriousness of the offence. See _Terence Seow_ at \[42\] and \[52\].

27     This was a serious offence affecting credit cards and financial services involving multiple credit cards that had resulted in a loss of $8,500. In _Law Aik Meng_, the High Court highlighted that Parliament intended offences prosecuted under the CMA to be treated seriously, and that deterrence functioned as a necessary sentencing consideration in all such offences. The policy consideration then concerned the increasing use of computers, the difficulty in detecting computer crimes, the need to protect the population against such crimes and to ensure that Singapore remained an attractive place for investors and businesses to operate effectively and securely. See _Law Aik Meng_ at \[36\] to \[38\]. These concerns remain valid today as the Government continues to push digitalisation efforts to transform Singapore into a Smart Nation.

28     The Prosecutor had submitted a Singapore Police advisory dated 6 April 2020 on unauthorised transactions using stolen credit/debit cards and credit/debit card information in their bundle of documents for sentencing. In the advisory, the Police highlighted that there was an increase in unauthorised transactions using stolen credit/debit card information. In 2019, the Police received at least 695 reports of unauthorised transactions, compared to 555 reports received in 2018, with total losses amounting to at least $4 million. In the same advisory, the Police reminded the public that the unauthorised use of another person’s credit or debit card was a serious offence.

29     It was clear that the dominant sentencing principles applicable in the present case was general deterrence and retribution. General deterrence seeks to educate and deter like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender in appropriate cases. The essence of the retributive principle is that the offender must pay for what he has done. The punishment must reflect the seriousness of the crime. In this case, rehabilitation as a sentencing consideration has not displaced either deterrence or retribution and, as such probation is not an appropriate option.

#### Community-Based Sentencing

30     CBS options gives the courts flexibility in sentencing that combines punishment with rehabilitation, such as where the offenders had specific and minor mental conditions. For such cases, the offender could tap on community resources and benefit from treatment. CBS options also cater for short imprisonment terms in the form of SDOs. In the present case, CBS and SDO options were not appropriate, given the seriousness of the offence that warranted a much longer custodial sentence. See _Teo Chiang Heng_ at \[11\], \[12\] and \[17\]. The two cases cited by counsel in support of CBS sentencing can be distinguished from the present case.

31     In _Teo Chiang Heng_, the offender who was untraced had pleaded guilty to one charge of mischief, punishable under s426 of the Penal Code. He had caused damage to a car that belonged to his spouse and that car was being maintained by him. He was sentenced to a 10-day SDO and 120 hours CSO. The Prosecution’s appeal to impose an imprisonment term of 2-weeks was dismissed by the High Court. The High Court held that the sentence was appropriate as the facts were unusual and quite exceptional. The offender had acted rashly, and he called the police immediately to surrender himself.

32     In the case of _Malvin Ng Yi Lun_, the offender had pleaded guilty to two counts of theft of items valued at a total of $13,659. The accused, a 26-year-old first offender, was sentenced to a community sentence comprising of an SDO of ten days, a DRO for a period of 12 months, and a CSO to perform 200 hours of community service. The Defence’s appeal on the sentence was dismissed by the High Court. Unlike the present case, all the stolen items were recovered, and the offender was also suffering from Major Depressive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder at the material time.

#### Custodial Sentence

33     It was not disputed by the parties that the sentencing considerations in _Law Aik Meng_ (at \[41\] to \[42\]) applied in the event a custodial sentence was imposed by the court.

34     The custodial threshold has been crossed for the following reasons:

> (a)     The offence affected the delivery of financial services and the integrity of the credit card payment systems.

> (b)     The offence was committed as part of a group in a syndicate to use stolen card information to cheat and enrich themselves.

> (c)     The actual loss of $8,500 caused by the offence was significant. There was no restitution.

> (d)     The potential loss could have been as high as the credit limits for the 5 ‘stolen’ cards.

> (e)     There was more than 1 victim affected by the accused’s actions. The offence would have caused alarm and inconvenience to the 3 card holders disputing the transactions.

> (f)     The offence was premeditated. According to paragraph 7 of the SOF, the accused would take the cards to the washroom to take the photographs. The accused knew that the card information would be used to perform unauthorised monetary transactions using the photographed card information and did not give his own card details.

> (g)     The accused had access to the customers’ card details because they had handed their cards over to process payment. The accused had betrayed their trust by sending their card information to others, knowing the information would be used for unauthorised monetary transactions.

> (h)     When Chua told the accused that he needed money, the accused chose to bring in Chua as another source to obtain card information from the unsuspecting customers.

> (i)     The accused did not stop taking photographs of the customers’ cards on his own accord. The accused had taken photographs of the customers’ cards over a period of 1 week and received $250 from Koh. The accused gave $50 to Chua. According to paragraph 11 of the SOF, the accused had stopped taking photographs of customers’ cards and told Chua to stop because Koh had told him to stop doing so.

35     The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. Counsel submitted that any custodial sentence should not exceed one month’s imprisonment. Taking into account the harm caused and the culpability of the accused, and having regard to the cited precedents, I decided that an imprisonment term of 5 months would be an appropriate deterrent sentence, after taking into account the mitigation plea.

36     The accused was untraced and he was remorseful. According to paragraph 11 of the SOF, the accused deleted from his mobile phone his chat history with Koh and Chua, and told Chua to do the same. This was done to destroy the evidence of what they had done. However, investigations led to the retrieval of the photographs from the accused’s mobile phone. The accused would have known that the Prosecution would have no difficulty proving the charge against him and this reduced the mitigation value of his plea of guilt. See _Public Prosecutor v Tay Beng Guan Albert_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 778</span> at \[16\].

37     It is trite law that save for very exceptional or extreme circumstances, financial hardship cannot be relied upon as a mitigating factor. See _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ \[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 406. Counsel submitted that an imprisonment term would cause severe hardship to the accused’s family. This would be the unavoidable outcome when the main or sole breadwinner of a family was imprisoned but the court cannot modify a sentence just because the family would suffer. See _Lai Oei Mui Jenny_ at \[11\] and \[12\]. In the present case, there were no exceptional reasons for me to reduce the sentence on this ground. The accused’s family may approach government agencies for financial assistance, if applicable.

38     The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence, has filed an appeal against the sentence I imposed. The accused is currently on bail pending the appeal.
