> **3** **rd** **charge (MAC 910153-2017)**

> … \[o\]n 15 May 2016, at or about 1.45 am, at the void deck of Block 314 Ubi Avenue 1, Singapore, did use criminal force to one T \[name redacted\] (DOB: 7 April 1993), _to wit_, by grabbing her right breast (over her dress) with your hand, intending to outrage her modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2       The accused was convicted on the first charge at the end of trial and sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment. He has filed an appeal against conviction but has not appealed against sentence. He was acquitted on the second and third charges and the prosecution has appealed against the orders of acquittal. The accused is currently serving sentence and has not been released on bail pending appeal.

## BACKGROUND FACTS

3       On 14 May 2016, T \[name redacted\] (PW1) who was then aged about 23 years old, a student at the Singapore Institute of Management, went to a pub called Blu Jaz at Haji Lane with her friend Glenn Nigel s/o Jaishanker (“Glenn”) (PW4). They arrived sometime around 8 p.m. to 9 p.m..

4       They ordered and consumed several jugs of beer. According to T, she drank about 5 to 6 glasses of beer in a span of two hours or so. Due to the amount of alcohol she consumed, T became dizzy, threw up and passed out. According to Glenn, she vomited on him and became unresponsive. Glenn carried her out of Blu Jaz with the help of another customer. The next thing T realized was that she was in a taxi (SHD 4911D) with the accused, which was driven by Keng Chin Teng (“Mr Keng”) (PW3).

5       Unbeknown to T, several events had transpired after she passed out. Glenn had hailed a taxi outside Blu Jaz and brought her to Hotel 81 at 85 Lavender Street (“Hotel 81”) which was about 5 minutes away. T could not recall this taxi ride and according to Glenn, she was “pretty much unconscious” and kept quiet the whole way.

6       When they arrived at Hotel 81, Glenn struggled to get T out of the taxi. He got the accused who was nearby to help him. Video footage from Hotel 81 (Exhibit P3) showed that at around 1.16 a.m., Glenn entered the lobby of Hotel 81, followed by the accused who was carrying T. As there were no available rooms, Glenn left. T was carried out of the hotel by the accused. When T saw the video footage, she said that it showed she was unresponsive, completely passed out, could not move and had to be carried out.[^1]

7       The accused carried T and placed her on some stairs just outside Hotel 81. According to Glenn, T was still unresponsive and unable to communicate. She leant on the railing of the stairs. Her eyes were closed and she had no control of her body.[^2]

8       Soon after, Glenn left to look for another hotel. He left T with the accused and asked him to wait there. The accused offered Glenn his handphone number but Glenn did not take it as his handphone had run out of battery.[^3] Shortly after he left, Glenn (who was also intoxicated) formed the mistaken impression that he had left his ATM card at Blu Jaz. He hailed a taxi and proceeded towards Blu Jaz to retrieve his card. However, as he found his ATM card on him, he instructed the taxi driver to return to Hotel 81. When he arrived, he was shocked to find that the accused and T were no longer there. Glenn tried desperately to look for T in the vicinity but could not find her.

9       Not long after Glenn had left the vicinity of Hotel 81 to look for another hotel, T asked the accused to bring her home. The accused proceeded to flag down Mr Keng’s taxi. He carried T, placed her in the taxi and got in with her. The taxi first proceeded to a hotel at Balestier, then to another at Geylang Lorong 4. Finally, the taxi proceeded to Blk 314 Ubi Aveune 1 where T lived after she managed to state her address or postcode. The accused paid the taxi fare and alighted from the taxi with T. He brought T to the void deck and sat her at a stone table. T was still unable to walk on her own and the accused had to support or carry her there. The accused then left.

10     Exhibit P3 (the video from Hotel 81) showed that Glenn, the accused and T entered the hotel lobby at around 1.16 a.m.. Investigations showed that Mr Keng picked the accused and T up at around 1.20 a.m. and that they were dropped off at Blk 314 Ubi Avenue 1 at about 1.40 a.m.. At about 3.31 a.m., a member of the public called the police and reported, “A female Chinese national is raped and she is crying. I only know this is the doing of a Malay man…”.

11     The prosecution’s case was that by carrying T into the taxi, the accused had abducted her. It was also alleged that while travelling in the taxi, the accused had used criminal force on T by lifting up her dress by sliding his hand up her thigh and by grabbing her breast (over her dress). It was lastly alleged that the accused molested T again at the void deck of Blk 314 Ubi Avenue 1 by grabbing her right breast (over her dress) with his hand.

## EVALUATION OF THE FIRST CHARGE (ABDUCTION)

12     Abduction is defined in s 362 of the Penal Code as:-

> 362.  Whoever by force compels, or by any deceitful means induces any person to go from any place, is said to abduct that person.

13     In _Public Prosecutor v Ong Soon Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 58</span>, Aedit Abdullah, J held that a charge of abduction could be made out even if the victim was unconscious.[^4] He stated at \[110\]:-

> 110    I appreciated that this interpretation of s 362 may create a broad scope of criminal liability, insofar as the movement of a sleeping spouse, the assisting of a person in a wheelchair, or a Good Samaritan’s moving of an unconscious victim out of harm’s way would _prima facie_ constitute an offence. Nevertheless, there are general defences in the PC, as well as the discretion of the Public Prosecutor, that will limit any injustice that may be caused by this reading of s 362 of the PC. In addition, a different interpretation will be inconsistent with the plain and ordinary reading of the word “compel” as explained above.

14     T could not recall any of the events which occurred around the vicinity of Hotel 81. It was however not in dispute that Glen had asked the accused to wait for him and look after T while he left the scene.[^5] In his defence, the accused claimed that T had asked him to bring her home and that he was trying to save her. While both sides agreed that T had asked the accused to bring her home, the point of contention was whether T had informed the accused that she lived at Ubi as well as her block number (“address”).

15     I would firstly observe that the accused must have noticed that T was in a highly intoxicated state and had passed out. When T asked to be brought home, it was likely that she had briefly regained consciousness and had mumbled her request. The accused must have noticed that she was still in a drunken stupor as she had to be carried to the taxi. It was quite inexplicable that the accused should ignore Glenn’s request to remain at Hotel 81, especially since he did not have Glenn’s phone number. From the objective evidence available, only about 5 minutes had elapsed from the time they entered the lobby of Hotel 81 until the time the accused flagged down Mr Keng’s taxi.[^6] It was difficult to accept the accused’s evidence that he had intended to bring T home, when he also claimed that she did not even give him her address.

16     In contending that the accused knew T’s address, the prosecution relied on the accused’s statement to the police recorded on 1 June 2016 (Exhibit P12). He admitted at \[7\] that T informed him that she lived at Ubi as well as her block number while they were at the staircase outside Hotel 81. He stated:-

> ... She repeatedly asked me to send her back to Ubi. I asked her which part of Ubi she is staying and she gave me her block number. I could not remember what block she told me that day. But I confirmed that she did tell me her block number. I then hailed a cab at the side of the road and took a blue Comfort taxi straight to her block.

17     The defence did not challenge the admissibility of Exhibit P12, which the accused affirmed to be true and correct. In court, the accused sought to retract his admission that T had provided her address on the basis that he had given his statement wrongly. He claimed that he was in a state of shock, that he was confused and wanted to be released as soon as possible from custody. He also claimed to be suffering from alcoholic withdrawal symptoms.[^7] However, according Sgt Mohamad Isak Bin Juma’at (PW7) who recorded Exhibit P12, the accused did not raise any such issues. If so, he would have stopped recording the statement. From his observation, the accused was in a state to provide the statement.[^8] In his second statement recorded on 31 October 2016 (Exhibit P14), the accused stated, “What I said in the previous statement is true”. His re-affirmation of the truth of the contents of Exhibit P12 showed that his retraction of his admission in court was an afterthought, once he realized the significance of his admission.

18     In my assessment, it was safe to rely on the accused’s admission in Exhibit P12 that T had given him her address. Since he had her address, he should have brought her straight home if he genuinely intended to help her. He had no good reason to divert the taxi to two different hotels. I rejected the accused’s claim that when he hailed the taxi, he wanted T to give her address to the taxi driver directly. This claim was not supported by Mr Keng who testified that the accused had directed him to go to a hotel at Balestier and then to another at Geylang Lorong 4.

19     If as the accused alleged, he did not have T’s address, it would be inexplicable for him to have flagged down a taxi, since he would not know where to direct the taxi. He did not even try to obtain T’s address before he stopped the taxi. If as he claimed, he wanted T to provide her address to the taxi driver directly, he should have aborted the taxi ride when it became clear that T did not or could not state her address. The fact that the accused diverted the taxi to two different hotels made it doubtful that he had noble intentions when he carried T into the taxi.

20     The accused had maintained steadfastly during the prosecution’s case that he had brought T straight home.[^9] When confronted with irrefutable evidence, he changed his position and admitted that the taxi had first gone to a hotel at Balestier and then to another at Geylang. However, he attempted to shift the blame to Mr Keng. He claimed that Mr Keng had on his own volition decided to drive to the two hotels i.e. the accused did not instruct him to proceed as such. This claim is unbelievable. As a taxi driver, Mr Keng’s duty was to proceed only as directed by his passengers and it was extremely doubtful that he would do otherwise. When the journey ended, the accused even paid the taxi fare in full without complaint. Mr Keng was an independent witness and I have no reason to doubt the veracity of this aspect of his testimony.

21     As a further explanation for the detour, the accused also claimed paradoxically that he wanted to bring T to a hotel, so that she could meet Glenn.[^10] I did not accept his claim. He had testified that when he flagged down the taxi, he was trying to save T from Glenn. He felt that T needed saving as she had told him that Glenn was not her boyfriend and he did not know what was going on between them.[^11] Since he felt the need to save T from Glenn, his evidence that he wanted to bring her to a hotel to meet Glenn was unbelievable. There was absolutely no basis for this claim nor was there a good explanation for the taxi’s detour. If indeed the accused had wanted the parties to meet up again, he should simply have remained at the vicinity of Hotel 81 to await Glenn’s return. There was also no need to incur the costs of a taxi ride to bring T to a different hotel.

22     The prosecution had also changed its case during the course of trial. Initially, its case was that T was so intoxicated that she was not able to ask the accused to bring her home. However, the prosecution’s case theory changed. It was asserted that while T did ask the accused to bring her home, she also provided her address to him. While this was not the most satisfactory way to conduct a case, the change in the prosecution’s position did not affect the abduction charge adversely since this only involved a re-interpretation of the available facts and material which were before the court, and in particular the weight to be placed on Exhibit P12.

23     Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that the accused had intended to abduct T when he carried her into the taxi. He did not intend to bring her home although he had her address. Instead, he chose to divert the taxi to two different hotels. I therefore found that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving the abduction charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was therefore found guilty and convicted as charged.

## EVALUATION OF SECOND AND THIRD CHARGES (OUTRAGE OF MODESTY)

#### T’s evidence

24     T testified that when she awoke, she found herself in a taxi, lying on the lap of a stranger (the accused) with her upper body draped over his lap. She was in the back seat behind the driver. The accused’s arm was over the right side of her body. She did not know how she got into the taxi.[^12]

25     The accused asked if she wanted to go to his place. She felt scared and felt the need to get home safely. She felt his hand sliding up her skirt on her upper thigh towards her “butt”. The skirt of her dress moved up exposing her skin. He moved his hand up the right side of her body. He grabbed and cupped her right breast. She felt his fingers close around her right breast, exerting slight pressure.[^13] With the limited extent of her consciousness, she was only able to keep repeating her postal code as a matter of her survival instinct. Then she faded out and everything went black.[^14]

26     The next thing she remembered was that she was being carried to the stone bench. She had no control of her body or movement and her head was on the stone table. She then felt a very forceful grab on her right breast and cried out in pain. She heard him say, “Do you even know what I am doing for you?”[^15]

#### Corroboration necessary unless testimony is unusually convincing

27     In cases involving alleged sexual assault, it is well established that unless the complainant’s testimony is unusually convincing, there would be a need for corroborative evidence in order to safely sustain a conviction. For example, in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 9</span>, Chan Seng Onn, J stated at \[25\]:-

> 25    When a conviction is based solely on the bare words of the complainant and nothing else, the complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt on its own, only when it is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration. In other words, if the evidence of the complainant is not unusually convincing, the conviction on the sole basis of the complainant’s testimony would be unsafe unless there is further corroborative evidence. See _Pram Nair_ (\[14\] supra at \[57\] and _Haliffie_ (\[14 supra at \[27\] and \[30\].)

28     The relevant considerations in determining whether a witness is unusually convincing are his or her demeanour, as well as the internal and external consistencies found in the witness’ evidence.[^16]

#### T’s testimony was not unusually convincing

29     In my assessment, T’s testimony was not unusually convincing. She was in a highly intoxicated state and fell in and out of consciousness. While her accounts of the alleged incidents of molest were fairly consistent internally, the scope of her evidence was severely limited due to the memory lapses caused by her highly intoxicated state. While she described the alleged incidents in quite specific detail, she had next to no memory of other events. Even her account of how she was carried out of Blu Jaz was sketchy and vague.

30     T’s evidence displayed a lack of consistency when measured against objective external evidence. It was not in dispute that Glenn first arrived at the vicinity of Blk 314 Ubi Avenue 1, followed by Sgt Renuga Devi (“Sgt Devi”) (PW6) and that T had spoken to Glenn and given a statement to Sgt Devi. However, the prosecution did not adduce any evidence of T’s interaction with Sgt Devi from T. Her evidence suggested that she only gave a statement to the IO Goh.[^17]

31     T’s account of how she interacted with Glenn was also inconsistent with the objective evidence. She only recalled that she saw many messages from Glenn on her phone and that after her physical examination at Kandang Kerbau Hospital, she messaged him through Whatsapp. She did not even speak to him on the phone. Her evidence was so confused that she did not even mention Glenn’s presence at the scene.

32     Sgt Devi testified that when she arrived at the scene, Glenn approached her and told her that T had been molested. She immediately went to attend to T who was crying and seemed to be in distress. It took about 20 to 30 minutes to calm her down to get the facts from her. According to Sgt Devi:-[^18]

> When I interviewed her, she informed that she was brought into a cab by a stranger, and then the suspect was touching her chest area and her thighs. She told him to stop, and subsequently she passed out in the cab. The next moment, she was in void deck, and felt the suspect touch her right chest area. That’s when she screamed for help, and she saw suspect walk away, and passerby came and called the police.

33     T’s account to Sgt Devi was inconsistent with her evidence in court and the objective evidence in material respects. No explanation was provided for the discrepancies:-

> (a)     While she told Sgt Devi that she was brought into the taxi by a stranger, she testified that she could not recall getting into the taxi at all;

> (b)     While she informed Sgt Devi that she told T to stop when they were in the taxi, she did not testify to this in court. Nor was her claim to Sgt Devi supported by Mr Keng;

> (c)     While she told Sgt Devi that the accused touched her chest area when she was at the void deck, her evidence was that he had forcefully grabbed her right breast;

> (d)     While she told Sgt Devi she screamed for help, her evidence in court was that she screamed out in pain when her right breast was grabbed forcefully;

> (e)     While she told Sgt Devi that she saw her molester walk away, she said no such thing in court; and

> (f)     T’s account to Sgt Devi suggested that after the accused touched her and she screamed, someone came to her aid soon after and called the police. In reality, the taxi dropped T and the accused off at about 1.40 a.m.. The molest was alleged to have occurred at about 1.45 a.m.. However, the police were only called at about 3.31 a.m.. There was therefore a huge gap in T’s memory and confusion on T’s part.

34     In view of the numerous lapses in T’s memory and the discrepancies stated at \[33\], her evidence was not unusually convincing and it would have been unsafe to convict the accused without further corroborative evidence. There were also risks associated with relying on the evidence of severely intoxicated persons, as Dr Winslow testified.

#### The evidence of Dr Winslow

35     The defence engaged the services of Dr Munidasa Winslow (DW3), a Senior Consultant Psychiatrist at Winslow Clinic. His report was admitted as Exhibit D4. His evidence went largely unchallenged.

36     Dr Winslow did not examine T, but from the available evidence, he opined that T was in a state of acute intoxication and that it was likely that she was experiencing an alcoholic blackout. From his observation of Exhibit P3 (the Hotel 81 video), T was totally stuporous and unconscious. She was rather flaccid, not able to walk and could not hold up her head as she had no neck tone.

37     Dr Winslow estimated her blood alcohol level (“BAC”) to be between 250 to 400 milligrams per 100 ml of blood. At such high blood alcohol levels, individuals have been assessed to exhibit the following signs and symptoms:-[^19]

> (a)     Impaired consciousness, sleep or stupor

> (b)     Vomiting, incontinence of urine and feces

> (c)     Marked muscular incordination, inability to stand or walk

> (d)     Markedly decreased response to stimuli

> (e)     General inertia, approaching loss of motor functions

> (f)     Exaggerated emotional states (fear, rage, grief etc)

> (g)     Disorientation, mental confusion, dizziness.

38     I noted that T had experienced most or all of these signs and symptoms. Dr Winslow stated that an alcoholic blackout could be complete or fragmentary. In a complete blackout, the subject would not remember anything. In a fragmentary blackout, there could be periods when there are flashes or glimpses of memory. In the present case, as T could recall partial details, this suggested that she could be suffering from an alcohol induced fragmentary blackout. Given her BAC levels, there could be mental confusion and misinterpretation of events.[^20] The individual’s memory could be vague and patchy with an increased potential for suggestibility.[^21] There was also the added risk of confabulation i.e. when the subject makes up for gaps in memory by creating false memories or occurrences. There could also be confusion in time sequencing.[^22]

39     Due to T’s intoxicated state, the gaps in her memory and recall, as well as the potential issues Dr Winslow had flagged, I was of the view that there was a real risk that T’s perception and recall could have been adversely affected. In my assessment, a conviction would not be safe unless there was corroboration of T’s evidence.

#### Lack of corroborative evidence

40     The prosecution contended that T’s account was corroborated by Sgt Devi and Mr Keng. I was not of the same view.

#### T’s account to Sgt Devi was of little evidential value

41     The prosecution had asserted that T’s statement to Sgt Devi amounted to corroborative evidence. It was difficult to rely on this statement. T did not even seem to recall giving a statement to Sgt Devi or meeting her, despite interacting with her for at least 20 to 30 minutes. She was also clearly very upset with Glenn for having abandoned her to a stranger, and what was going through her mind at that time could not be tested due to her alleged failure of memory.

42     In _AOF v Public Prosecutor_, the court stated at \[114\]:-

> 114    First, subsequent repeated complaints by the complainant cannot, in and of themselves, constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement for “unusually convincing” testimony. As Yong Pung How CJ noted in the Singapore High Court decision of _Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 591</span> (“_Khoo Kwoon Hain_”) at \[51\]:

>> If the complainant’s evidence is not ‘unusually convincing’, I cannot see how the fact that she repeated it several times can add much to its weight.

43     As I did not find T’s evidence to be unusually convincing, little evidential value could be placed on her statement to Sgt Devi (or for that matter to Glenn),[^23] although her claims were made soon after the alleged incidents. What she stated did not mitigate the risks of relying on a statement of an acutely intoxicated person, as enumerated by Dr Winslow. For example, if T was confused and had confabulated her memory to fill in the gaps by creating false memories or occurrences, she would have merely regurgitated her confabulated account to Glenn and Sgt Devi. There were also inconsistencies between her evidence in court and her statement to Sgt Devi as stated at \[33\] above.

#### T’s account was not corroborated by Mr Keng

44     I did not accept the prosecution’s contention that T’s evidence was corroborated by Mr Keng.[^24] Mr Keng had testified that he felt suspicious and saw it fit to warn the accused not to do anything wrong when the accused and T alighted from his taxi. I could not see how mere suspicion could form any basis for corroboration, especially when Mr Keng did not see any wrongdoing in his taxi and was not able to articulate any valid basis for his suspicion. His suspicion was not based on any inkling that T had been or would be molested. Rather, it was related to issues such as that T and the accused were a mixed race couple and that T was drunk.[^25]

45     The fact that T uttered her postal code could not corroborate the allegation that she was molested, but showed that she wanted to go home. As she explained:-[^26]

> … I kept repeating my postal code because it is the only thing I could think of at that moment. It was the only thing I know of as home because my thought were “I want to go home.”

46     This would not be surprising as she was shocked to find herself in a taxi with a stranger, having no recollection of how she got into the taxi. Since she could speak, if she had indeed been molested, she could have asked the accused to stop (as she claimed to Sgt Devi) or called out for help, instead of repeating her postal code. However, none of these occurred.

47     Nor was there corroboration for the third charge. When Mr Keng dropped T and the accused off, he had to stop for a while to wash his rubber mat as T had vomited on it. He was quite close to the stone table where T was brought to, but did not hear T scream as she alleged. As has been stated, while Mr Keng dropped the accused and T off at about 1.40 a.m., the police were only called at about 3.31 a.m.. T was unable to account for what had occurred during the intervening period and was clearly confused as to what had occurred.

#### Mr Keng’s evidence suggested that T was not molested

48     Contrary to the prosecution’s submission that Mr Keng’s evidence served to corroborate T’s account, his testimony suggested that T could not have been molested in his taxi. Mr Keng’s evidence suggested that T was not lying on the accused as she alleged, but that she was sitting up:-[^27]

> Q    And according to you they were not sitting or rather they were not sitting as if they were boyfriend and girlfriend, is that correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Was she lying down on top of him?

> A    No.

> Q    So she was sitting on the right side behind you and he was sitting on the left side, is that correct?

> A    Yes.

49     He agreed that when the accused placed her in the taxi, T was in a seated position and was sitting up.[^28] He clarified that she was leaning on the back of her seat.[^29] At the end of the taxi ride, Mr Keng noticed that T was still sitting up with her back against the seat. There was no suggestion that T was lying on the accused’s lap at any point during the ride.[^30] He did not see the accused molesting her or anything happening during the journey, even though he would have been able to observe what was happening via his rear view mirror.[^31]

50     As Mr Keng was suspicious of the accused, it would have been natural (despite his denial) to have glanced in his rear view mirror to see if anything was amiss. However he did not notice anything wrong.

#### Conclusion on the molest charges

51     In my view, there was no credible evidence to corroborate T’s account of events and it would have been unsafe to rely on T’s evidence alone to sustain a conviction. The benefit of doubt had to be extended to the accused. Having considered the totality of the evidence, I found that the prosecution had not discharged its burden of proving the molest charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was therefore acquitted of these charges.
