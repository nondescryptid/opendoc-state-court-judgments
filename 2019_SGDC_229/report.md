### District Judge Marvin Bay:

### Procedural history

Mr Sim Boon Hwa, a Singaporean aged 42, claimed trial to a single proceeded charge of consuming the specified drug _methamphetamine_, at a time on or before 10 January 2018, an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). The charge; DAC-902299-2018 specifies that Mr Sim:

> …on or before 10 January 2018, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev. Ed), to wit, **Methamphetamine**, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev. Ed).

2       The charge also indicated that Mr Sim was eligible to be punished with a long term class two (LT2) sentence as he had previously, on 14 February 2007 been convicted of a long term class one (LT1) offence in another district court. This was for consumption of the specified drug; Buprenorphine, _vide_ DAC03271/2007, and had then received the mandatory minimum term of five years; imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

3       Upon his conviction for this charge, Mr Sim (after some vacillation) eventually indicated his assent to plead guilty to two other drug-supervision related charges. Mr Sim’s CRO 60, when read out upon the plea of guilt, revealed that he had been convicted and sentenced to a **_previous LT 2_** offence in 2013, where he had been given the mandatory minimum of seven years’ and six strokes of the cane from 12 August 2018.

### Facts pertaining to plead guilty charges (DAC-916480-2018 and DAC-916481-2018) for failing to report for urine test

4       After Mr Sim’s release of 18 August 2017, he was placed under compulsory supervision for 24 months, until 17 August 2019[^1]. Mr Sim was thus required to present himself for urine testing at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters on regular twice-weekly intervals commencing from 21 August 2017. Mr Sim failed to attend the scheduled urine test on no fewer than five occasions. The two proceeded charges; DAC-916480-2018 and DAC-916481-2018, pertain to his failure to, without valid reason, attend urine tests scheduled on 5 January 2018 and 8 January 2018 at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters, which were respectively some **_five days_** and **_two days_** before his arrest on 10 January 2018. Mr Sim also agreed to the taking into consideration of two charges DAC-902300-2018 (for Possession of drug taking utensils contrary to sec 9 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) and DAC-916479-2018 (which was another charge for failing to report for urine test).

### Sentence imposed

5       After hearing salient submissions on sentencing, I imposed the following sentences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="8.52170434086817%"> <col width="55.6711342268454%"> <col width="35.8071614322865%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">No.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Charge and Offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence imposed</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-902299-2018 Section 8(b)(ii) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008) p/u Section 33A(2) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eight (8) years' and three (3) months' imprisonment and six (6) strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-916480-2018 Reg 15(3)(f) Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, RG 3)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One (1) year's imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-916481-2018 Reg 15(3)(f) Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, RG 3)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One (1) year's imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

6       I ordered the sentences in DAC-902299-2018 and DAC-916481-2018 to run consecutively (with DAC-916480-2018 to run concurrently) yielding a global sentence of nine years three months imprisonment and six stokes of the cane, with the imprisonment backdated to Mr Sim’s first remand..

### Scope of appeal(s)

7       Mr Sim has appealed against his conviction in DAC-902299-2018 as well as the sentences imposed for all three charges (including DAC-916480-2018 and DAC-916481-2018).

### Brief outline of sequence of events and positions taken

8       Before proceeding to set out the evidence in detail, I will sketch out the significant events in this case, and a brief outline of the accused person’s position, to allow a better appreciation of the salient considerations in this case.

### CNB raid leading to arrest of Mr Sim

9       Mr Sim does not dispute the facts that CNB officers arrested him following a morning raid: On 10 January 2018, at 10.15 a.m., a party of CNB officers had arrested Mr Sim at the first floor lift of Block 986C Buangkok Crescent. The CNB officers raided unit #XXX of this block. The occupant of the unit, a certain Tan Chew Wah as also arrested. Mr Sim was brought to the said unit, and an improvised smoking utensil was recovered from the table in the unit. Mr Sim has readily admitted to ownership of the utensil.

### Procurement and testing of Mr Sim’s urine samples

10     Following his arrest, Mr Sim’s urine samples were procured, tested and sealed in accordance with CNB procedures. The officers at the scene were Officer Ong Yu Ying, the IUT operator, Jason Yuen Chee Wai, the escorting officer (PW12), and Officer Benjamin Xu, the sealing officer (PW13). The officers stated that nothing remarkable had occurred at the point of Mr Sim’s urine procurement.

11     To be clear, Mr Sim does not dispute that his urine sample contained _methamphetamine_. The detection of _methamphetamine_ from prescribed testing processes would trigger a presumption under section 22 of the MDA that Mr Sim had indeed consumed _methamphetamine_. The **_burden of proof_** thus fell on Mr Sim to prove on a balance of probabilities, that he had not consumed _methamphetamine_.

12     The prosecution called a slate of no fewer than 15 witnesses with their evidence heard over four days, and I decided, upon closure of their case, that Mr Sim indeed had a case to answer.

13     After the allocution was pronounced, Mr Sim declined to give evidence on his own behalf. He had cited his reservation to taking an oath. Mr Sim was given the option of affirming, available for persons who professed a conscientious objection of making an oath, pursuant to the provisions of the Oaths and Declaration Act, but eschewed from this option. Given an entire morning to reconsider, he reaffirmed his election to remain silent instead.

14     While Mr Sim had signalled an intent to call Mr Tan Chew Wah, the person who had occupied the premises raided by CNB, to be his witness, he subsequently changed his mind after Mr Tan had arrived and signalled some hostility to the accused. While advised that Mr Tan could still be compelled to give evidence if he so chose, Mr Sim decided against calling him[^2] or any other witnesses in his defence, but did tender sets of voluminous handwritten submissions and replies to the prosecution’s counter submissions. Mr Sim’s principal line of resistance against the charge was that he had been served _methamphetamine_ tainted water at the holding area. His spiking defence essentially has it that the escorting officer, Jason Yuen had proffered the cups of water. After due consideration of the prosecution’s case and Mr Sim’s submissions, he was convicted and the sentence pronounced, after a careful deliberation of salient presenting facts and sentencing factors.

15     I will now embark on a more detailed examination of the prosecution’s case.

### The Prosecution’s case.

16     The prosecution called the following witnesses

### Evidence of PW1, Arif Azfar Bin Azman

17     PW1 Arif Azfar Bin Azman had placed Mr Sim under arrest on 10 January 2018 at about 10:15am at 986C Buangkok Crescent. He had proceeded to arrest Mr Tan Chew Wah at the apartment. Thereafter he had searched the apartment, and found an improvised smoking device, which Officer Arif had seized. Mr Sim had claimed ownership of this device. On the accused’s demeanour during his arrest, Officer Arif noted that Mr Sim seemed to be ‘_kind of shocked that he was arrested’[^3]_ but did not recall his exhibiting any form of physical distress.

### Evidence of PW2, Mohamad Mustaqium Bin Wajid

18     Officer Mustaqium, who had attained the rank of inspector, had been observing the targeted unit; which was apartment XXX at 986C Buangkok Crescent. Past 10am, Officer Mustaqium had seen a ‘subject’ (who was later ascertained to be Mr Sim) walking out from the unit, and then along the along the fourth floor corridor. As Officer Mustaqium anticipated Mr Sim’s descent via the lift, and has thus instructed all accompanying officers to gather at the lift lobby ground floor to intercept this subject. Officer Mustaqium indicated that their ‘main target’ was actually a certain ‘_Tan Chew Wah’_[^4]. Mr Sim, whom Officer Mustaqium described as bespectacled and clad in a red shirt, was arrested at the lift. The CNB party then realised that Mr Sim was not their briefed target subject, and then directed their efforts to obtaining more information as he had been seen coming from the targeted unit. The officers determined that Mr Sim did not have the keys to the unit. Officer Mustaqium had then directed the team to go directly to the targeted apartment, where the party found Mr Tan Chew Wah in the unit. Mr Tan was arrested[^5].

### Evidence of PW3 Feroz Bin Abd Rahman and PW4 Mohamed Fadli Bin Mohamed Sayee

19     Narcotics officer Feroz Bin Abd Rahman, who held the rank of station inspector, was in the arresting party and recalled that Mr Sim taciturn demeanour as ‘_he didn’t talk much when we ask him some questions_’[^6] He did not note any injuries on Mr Sim. After Mr Sim’s interception at the ground floor after he had come down from the lift, Officer Feroz recalled escorting Mr Sim back to his point of emergence on the fourth floor, where another man was detained and the premises subject to a search. Mr Sim was then taken to CNB’s Cantonment premises. Officer Feroz was familiar with the water dispenser at the holding area, and indicated that he had not noted anything unusual about this dispenser, which dispensed just ‘plain water’, and the facility was available for use by officers and detained persons alike[^7]. Detained suspects were commonly asked to take a drink from the dispenser when they were seen to be experiencing any apparent difficulty in producing a urine specimen for testing[^8].

20     Narcotics Officer Mohamed Fadli Bin Mohamed Sayee, who held the rank of senior staff sergeant, had recorded the long statement[^9] from Mr Sim. He had earlier been also in the raiding party and, had been the officer arresting Mr Tan Chew Wah. He had not noted any unusual occurrences during the arrest and described Mr Sim as ‘_quiet_’ but ‘_not cooperative’_[^10]. At the fourth level apartment, Officer Fadli had recovered a ‘**_dry_** _utensil for smoking ice’[^11]_

21     When questioned by Mr Sim about the procedure for the supply of water in the holding area of CNB’s Cantonment facilities, Officer Fadli indicated that detained persons were expected to take a cup to fill with water from the dispenser on their own, unless they had sustained any hand injuries or mobility problems which restricted their ability to do so[^12].

22     At cross-examination Officer Fadli was not aware of any instance of verbal abuse or intimidation by a narcotics officer Mr Sim identified as Benjamin Xu[^13]. He was also unaware of any untoward behaviour by Officer Cynthia Lee whom Mr Sim accused of, _inter alia_, making threats of ‘whacking’ him in the toilet[^14]. Officer Fadli also denied Mr Sim’s suggestion that he had ordered Officer Benjamin Xu to pass Mr Sim three cups pf ‘_questionable water to drink at CNB Cantonment Police Complex during the procurement of_ (Mr Sim’s) _urine specimen’_ on 10 January 2018[^15].

### Evidence of PW5 Mohammad Nasran Bin Janbari

23     Officer Nasran had been in the raiding party, and had thereafter escorted Mr Sim to the lock-up. The officer had not noted anything unusual in Mr Sim’s demeanour, nor spotted any injuries on his person[^16]. Officer Nasran was familiar with the water cooler at the holding area, and indicated that it was open for use by all, that he himself had _‘personally drunk from it’_, and noted nothing unusual from his use of that facility[^17]. Users, which included officers and accused persons could avail themselves to disposable paper cups situated next to the water cooler[^18].

### Evidence of PW 6 Lau Keng Wah and PW 7 Shahreen Sofan Said

24     The two witnesses provided formal evidence on uncontested aspects of the prosecution’s case. Officer Lau informed the court that Mr Sim was a drug supervisee at the time of his arrest, and Staff Sergeant Shahreen had taken the urine samples collected from Mr Sim, for onward conveyance to HSA for analysis, and gave evidence of the protocol involved.

### Evidence of PW 8 Chong Kai Wen

25     Officer Chong, a Staff sergeant of CNB, who was an investigation officer assigned to the case. Officer Chong had sought to recover CCTV footage of the area at, or around, the period that Mr Sim’s urine procurement process was undertaken. He was told, however, that the footage had been overwritten, as the footage only had a ‘_validity of 30 days.’_[^19] Upon making enquiries, Officer Chong was also told _‘the area with the water dispenser wasn’t in the CCTV footage_’[^20]. The field of view of the CCTV did not show the waiting area where detained suspects were placed, and was instead directed to the proximate area around the entrance of the men’s toilet.

26     At cross-examination, IO Chong could **_not_** recall Mr Sim asking him to retrieve the CCTV after he had picked him up from the DRC on 17 January 2018, despite Mr Sim’s assertions that he had made such an oral request. He had only become aware of Mr Sim’s desire to secure the footage in the course of his investigation, where Mr Sim had made specific allegations of spiking having occurred from cups of water proffered at the water cooler. IO Chong had acted within two weeks of the request being relayed, but was told that the footage for the material date had been overwritten[^21]. Prior to this Officer Chong had been unaware that there would be a ‘_30-day cut-off period’_ in the lifespan of extant footage for the retrieval of such CCTV footage of a particular date and time.

27     Mr Sim also took issue with Officer Chong’s reference in an early iteration of the section 9 MDA change, to his (Mr Sim) being in possession of the improvised smoking utensil **_when_** he was accosted by CNB officers at level **_one_**, when the implement had, in actuality, been found in the apartment at level **_four_**. Officer Chong explained that he had drafted the charge in accordance to his understanding of the contents of the police report filed, where he had extrapolated from the stated ‘location of incident’, which had listed ‘Block 9AC Buangkok Crescent **_Level 1_**_[^22]’._ Mr Sim had been aggrieved by the possibility that this error might mischaracterise him as an active drug user, stating that there was a ‘_big difference’_ between having the utensil on his person, and the fact that it was found in the apartment, as he had ‘_abandoned it’_ and ‘_if I brought it along that means I’m using all the way’_.[^23]

### Accused’s police reports dated 14 February 2018

28     Officer Chong indicated that Mr Sim had, at the interview on 17 January 2018, raised, _inter alia_, the possibility of his having fallen victim to a deliberate spiking. As Mr Sim’s complaints also alleged missing property, which Officer Chong regarded to be beyond his jurisdiction as a narcotics officer[^24], he ‘_encouraged him to make a police report through a police officer’_.

29     The accused proffered his report made following his interview with Officer Chong, which was in the form of a letter dated **_14 February_** 2018 (which was beyond Officer Chong’s reported presumptive 30-day cut-off 10 January 2018). Mr Sim claimed to have been unable to make the report earlier _‘because inside prison we are not allowed to write to … police station’_, adding ruefully that the CCTV footage might have been recovered if he had been able to do so.

30     Mr Sim’s letter reads[^25]:

> To whom it may concern

> I, Sim Boon Hwa, (NRIC stated) wish to make 2 police report to the authority in regards upon my arrest during 10th January 2018 that I believe strongly there were hidden complication which I wanted to express. The 1st report, I found there was money missing in my possession.

> Second report, the CNB claimed that I consumed methamphetamine and charged me for consumption of methamphetamine in which I did not consume, after 29th December 2017 when I was discharged from IMH for detoxification.”

> Summary of my arrest.

> I was arrested by the CNB at Block 9A6C Buangkok Crescent Level 110 plus in the morning while going for breakfast. They rushed into the lift and took my cell phone and wallet. They questioned me few questions. I chose to came out because it came along with threats and rudeness. Also they asked me whether I consume any illegal drugs. I simply told them that upfront I did not. Continuation of threats and insult from those CNB bother me, and as a result, I was uncooperative and angry.

> **_While I was in Cantonment Police Station, I instantly asked for 3 glass of water to drink so that I could give my urine and leave as fast as possible. Personally, I took and drank 3 or 4 cups of water from the water dispenser._** And while waiting, CNB kept on passing threat and sarcastic remarks towards me.

> I simply ignore. Then 2 male CNBs came to me, one took a chair and sit in front of me and kept staring at me, instilling fear on me as though he wanted to kill me mentally. **_After that another CNB passed me 3 cups of water from the water dispenser. I drunk 2 cups and tried to stop at the 3rd cup but he kept pushing it to me, at last, I drank it. My mind and physical body began to function abnormally resulting in breathlessness, instability and lethargic._**

> On top of that, my urine was tested positive for methamphetamine. I consulted the doctor in the lock-up and asked why I’m so (at this point I was in confusion). And he said he will put me under observation. I was not able to think rationally because I was too weak and can’t breathe well but when I was sober, I recall what happened, I found that there must be hidden complication between those CNBs and I. The above statement are briefly written and I would further elaborate in detail when the IO comes to me. **_Lastly, I do not have any eyewitnesses in my defence except the CCTV in the Cantonment Police Station and in the lift as well_**.

> Your faithfully.

> February 14th, 2018. \[Emphasis added\]

31     Mr Sim described the errant officer who had allegedly offered him the tainted drink to be a short Chinese male[^26], whom he had provisionally identified as Benjamin Xu[^27], but later believed this person to be either Officer Jason Yuen, or an unidentified officer who resembled Officer Yuen.

### Evidence of PW 9 IUT administrator Ong Yu Jing

32     Officer Ong; a female CNB Staff Sergeant, was an Instant Urine test (IUT) operator at the material time, and gave evidence of the protocols involved in the operation of the system. Her role was essentially to siphon a suspect’s urine and place the sample inside the machine. The system generated a printed IUT slip[^28] revealing the results of urine analysis, which Officer Ong she signed as operator. She would also print out HSA labels and pass these to Officer Benjamin Xu, the designated sealing officer in Mr Sim’s case[^29]. Officer Ong indicated that the system also generated a timestamp, which reflected the point the suspect had been registered into the system. In Mr Sim’s case, this would be on 10 January 2018 **_at 12.06 pm_**[^30]. The time the urine was collected was not specifically documented, but Officer Ong indicated that testing would occur quickly after collection[^31]. Officer Ong noted that Mr Sim’s IUT slip showed a positive result for drug classes ‘_Amphetamine_’ and ‘_Benzodiazepines_’[^32]. At cross-examination, Officer Ong indicated that the Escorting Officer and Sealing Officer were, respectively, Officers Jason Yuen and Benjamin Xu, and did not agree with Mr Sim’s suggestion that the system allowed the true identities of these officers could be simply changed by officers with a ‘hidden agenda’.[^33]

### Forensic toxicological evidence from HSA’s Illicit Drugs Laboratory

33     Given the nature of this case, it was inevitable that toxicological evidence would play a pivotal role. As Mr Sim’s assertions principally involved deliberate spiking by CNB officers, along with an alternate possibility that the water he had been allegedly given had been accidentally tainted by contact with _methamphetamine_ from the officer’s prior handling of drugs or drug paraphernalia, it was important to understand not just the concentration of _methamphetamine_ found, but also whether human metabolic pathways would allow for _methamphetamine_ to be traced in his urine from an ingestion of contaminated water, which had occurred shortly before 12.06pm on 10 January 2018 (the time of his registration at the IUT counter).

### Evidence of PW10 HSA Analyst Ng Xue Yin

34     Ms Ng was an analyst at the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory division of the Health Sciences Authority. She had worked there for some four-and-a-half years, after graduating with second-class, upper-division honours Bachelor of Science degree (BSc) from NUS Ms Ng had processed the urine sample CSA 18000641, verified details against the submission form, unsealed the sample and then proceeded with the screening test. The screen found the sample to be positive for _amphetamines_, which then prompted her to continue with a confirmatory test. Ms Ng had analysed and interpreted the results; thereafter prepared HSA Certificate AT-1833-00372-001-03,[^34] on 15 January 2018 concerning the urine sample attributed to Mr Sim, where she had stated that upon analysis, ‘the urine sample was found to contain _methamphetamine_’.[^35]

### Concentration of methamphetamine found and duration of detection window

35     Ms Ng was unequivocal that the presence of _methamphetamine_ as presented in the tested sample was consistent with the consumption of _methamphetamine_.[^36] The drug could be detected within **_one to three days_** after the last consumption[^37]. Upon Mr Sim’s query as to the concentration of _methamphetamine_ found in the confirmatory test, Ms Ng indicated that she had detected **30 300** nanogrammes per millilitre of urine, where any detection at or above **500** nanogrammes per millilitre of urine would be deemed to be a positive result for the presence of _methamphetamine_ in the sample. When Mr Sim decried the vast difference between the quantity stated in the IUT slip, which listed a mere **4524.73** nanogrammes per millilitre of ‘_Amphetamine_’ detected, Ms Ng stated that the IUT test was a simplified non-laboratory procedure principally to **_detect_** the presence of certain classes of illicit drugs. A proper quantitative analysis would be required to ascertain the true concentration of _methamphetamine_ in the sample. This was accomplished by the confirmatory test in her laboratory at HSA, which specifically sought the presence of _methamphetamine_.[^38]

### Likelihood of concentration of methamphetamine to be present as a result of spiking

36     Mr Sim put his spiking theory to Ms Ng in the following terms:

> …(C)ould my urine result that is positive, could someone dislike me, spike me on my drink, and hence caused my urine specimen to contain meth before on---on 10 January 2018, is it possible?[^39]

37     Ms Ng’s response was unequivocal after learning the timeframes involved. Given the salience of the point to this case, I have reproduced her response below, beginning with Ms Ng’s clarification of the ambit of Mr Sim’s question[^40].

>   
| 

**Ms Ng**:

 | 

Do you know what’s the time that you were being spiked?

 |
| 

**Mr Sim**:

 | 

Mostly 11 plus.

 |
| 

**Ms Ng**:

 | 

So, it’s just before the urine was being procured?

 |
| 

**Mr Sim**:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

**Ms Ng**:

 | 

I think it’s not, **_I think it’s unlikely_**.

 |
| 

**Mr Sim**:

 | 

What---what is---

 |
| 

**Ms Ng**:

 | 

**_Based on the concentration, because it’s quite high_**\---

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Positive urine test results unlikely from ingestion 15-30 minutes before test

38     As can be seen from above Ms Ng responded to Mr Sim’s query that it was **_unlikely_** for _methamphetamine_ to be found in Mr Sim’s urine arising from any ingestion having occurred within a short interval from the time the sample was collected. The witness maintained her view despite Mr Sim’s questions on this theme (inclusive of occasional moderating interjections from the court and the DPP) extending to some ten pages of transcript. Given the importance of this point within the context of Mr Sim’s insistence that he had been unknowingly given _methamphetamine_ tainted water at the holding area, I have reproduced a fragment of the salient passage to demonstrate the affirmative nature of Ms Ng’s response, against Mr Sim’s persistent questioning[^41]:

>   
| 

**Mr Sim**:

 | 

Is it possible, within half an hour? Me with an empty stomach---with an empty stomach in the morning not taken any food and drink it---drink the water contain with meth, is it possible that your urine is tested with methamphetamine after 15 _(minutes)_ to half an hour?

 |
| 

**Ms Ng**:

 | 

Your Honour, given the time frame, 15 (_minutes_) to half an hour is **_unlikely_**.

 |
| 

**Mr Sim**:

 | 

How sure are you?

 |
| 

**Ms Ng**:

 | 

What do you mean by how sure am I?

 |
| 

**Mr Sim**:

 | 

Can it be 100% sure that it is impossible for the co---for the immune system?

 |
| 

**Ms Ng**:

 | 

Your Honour, from my stand, it’s **_unlikely…_** \[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Evidence of PW11 HSA analyst Evelyn Goh Mei Ling

39     Ms Goh, like Ms Ng before her, was an analyst at the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory division of the Health Sciences Authority. She had worked there in the area of drug abuse testing for some five-and-a-half years. Ms Goh had obtained a Masters in Science degree (MSc) from NUS in 2003 Ms Goh had processed the urine sample CSA 18000641, verified details against the submission form, unsealed the sample and then proceeded with the screening test. The screen found the sample to be positive for amphetamines, which then prompted her to continue with a confirmatory test[^42] by using the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry process, where _methamphetamine_, and its metabolite; _amphetamine_, would analysed. Ms Ng had accordingly analysed and interpreted the results; thereafter prepared HSA Certificate AT-1833-00372-001-03, on 15 January 2018[^43] concerning the urine sample attributed to Mr Sim, where she had stated that upon analysis, ‘the urine sample was found to contain _methamphetamine_’[^44]. Ms Ng gave a similar response to the previous witness in stating that _methamphetamine_ would remain detectable in urine between one to three days from last consumption[^45].

40     Upon questions passed by Mr Sim at cross-examination, Ms Ng indicated that there was a degree of variance in metabolism and excretion rate among different individuals, and also that the amount of water drunk might ‘affect the detection of _methamphetamine_ in the urine’[^46]. Ms Ng stated that the amount detected in her own test was **_33 600_** nanograms per millilitre of urine[^47]. Ms Ng also confirmed that the cut-off for a positive result was 500 nanograms per millilitre of urine. Ms Ng in responding to the accused’s hypothetical question of the possibility of detection by urine test after having consumed a significant quantity (500 millilitres) of water with 0.5 mg of _methamphetamine_[^48], indicated that she was unable to give a definitive answer as she was not trained as a pharmacologist but was able to express her general view that the metabolism of the _methamphetamine_ found in to have occurred within a window of fifteen minutes to one hour of consumption was ‘**_pretty much unlikely based on the… high concentration of_** (_methamphetamine_) **_found in the urine sample’_**_[^49]_**_._** Ms Ng explained that the _methamphetamine_ would have to pass through the blood-stream before the process of metabolic excretion by the body in a manner where the drugs would be detectable in a urine sample. Essentially _methamphetamine_ would, post-consumption, enter the bloodstream, and then metabolise in the kidneys, and finally excreted by _‘the renal organs’_.[^50] She thus clarified that it was **_‘not likely to reach this concentration’_**[^51]within a half-hour to an hour.

### Evidence of PW12 Jason Yuen

41     Officer Yuen, who had attained the rank of station inspector, was a 25-year veteran of CNB, and attached to intel-operations at the time. Officer Yuen was listed as Mr Sim’s escorting officer at the period of the urine procurement process, and seemed the witness whom Mr Sim directed his most pointed questions to.

42     Officer Yuen had been part of an observation detachment of CNB officers surveiling the vicinity of Buangkok Crescent, but was not part of the actual arrest party[^52]. He had, during the operation, remained at the void deck of the block when Mr Sim had emerged from Mr Tan Chew Wah’s apartment (which was the targeted unit), and had neither handled Mr Sim, or dealt with the seizure of his personal property at the site of his arrest. In relation to his role as escorting officer during the subsequent urine procurement, Officer Yuen’s account was that he had observed the usual protocol for urine collection. Officer Yuen had asked Mr Sim the standard question: ‘Are you comfortable to give urine?’[^53]. He had then invited Mr Sim to wash his hand before the collecting the bottles. Mr Sim was asked to select a big bottle and two small bottles. As Officer Yuen led lead him to the toilet, however, it was Mr Sim who had asked to be allowed to drink. Upon this request, Officer Yuen had escorted him to the dispenser[^54]. The water dispenser was located close to the ladies’ toilet. There, he had let the accused **_collect_** the water **_himself_**, and hereafter drink **_of his own volition_**, and did **_not monitor_** Mr Sim’s water intake[^55].

43     Officer Yuen categorically denied handing the accused water at any point in time.[^56] The cups which Mr Sim had used were from a stack of disposable cone-shaped cups situated close to the dispenser, and Mr Sim was **_not_** guided to select any particular cup[^57]. Officer Yuen found Mr Sim to be co-operative, and emphasized that it was Mr Sim who had asked for the water, and he (Officer Yuen) had not instructed him to drink. Officer Yuen’s evidence was also that he had not observed anything out of the ordinary during the urine procurement process, and did not note any aspects of Mr Sim’s own characterisation of his (Mr Sim’s) behaviour of shaking his head intermittently and talking to himself[^58]. Officer Yuen stated that he had had no prior dealings with Mr Sim, whom he had not known before 10 January 2018, and there had been no ‘_dispute or bad blood’_ with the accused. Officer Yuen stated that he had never handled _methamphetamine_ with his bare hands, and had not handled any _methamphetamine_ for all of 10 January 2018[^59].

### Accused questions whether PW12 was the actual escorting officer

44     At cross-examination, Mr Sim repeatedly questioned whether Officer Yuen was truly the escorting officer he had encountered that day. This was foreshadowed by Mr Sim’s persistent and somewhat cryptic questions inquiring whether Officer Yuen had changed his appearance, including whether he was wearing glasses that day and the manner he had worn his hair[^60]. The accused then alluded to there being a different officer playing the role of escorting officer, as he inquired: ‘_You’re the escorting officer? Then who seated right in front of me on that very day at Cantonment Police CNB?’[^61]_

45     Mr Sim’s line of questioning took an antagonistic turn, where he asked Officer Yuen if he had been subject to disciplinary action, and on receiving a negative reply, repeatedly asked the witness if he was aware of the consequences of lying on oath. Mr Sim was cautioned by the court to curb his manner of repetitive and highly offensive questioning which went along the lines of ‘_So, you just make your oath, just for the sake of making an oath without knowing the consequences’_.[^62] Mr Sim seemed repeatedly unable to accept Officer Yuen’s affirmative response that he was indeed the escorting officer, and insisted ‘_You are lying. You are not the …escorting officer._’[^63] before being directed to move along to a different area of questioning. Mr Sim even expressed his doubt that Officer Yuen had been at the scene of his arrest at Buangkok Crescent[^64], and insisted that CCTV footage covering the area be produced. The accused remained fixated with the notion that Officer Yuen was an imposter of sorts, and repeatedly revisited this again in his cross-examination, and when asked to clarify stated ‘_He_ (Officer Yuen) _looked like him. I don’t---it’s not him_.’ [^65] Rather peculiarly, Mr Sim also alleged that this officer resembling Officer Yuen had asked him to drink the curry gravy from the provided meal of _roti prata_ to ‘_mock and then humiliate’[^66]_ him, but had also offered him a white ‘_Kunag Galang’_[^67] brand cigarette stick to smoke[^68]. Officer Yuen admitted to a smoking habit, but indicated, rather, that his preferred brand was ‘_Lucky Strike’_.

### Evidence of PW 13 Benjamin Xu

46     Narcotics Officer Xu was a 13-year veteran of CNB, and had attained the rank of Staff Sergeant in that service. Like Officer Yuen, his role up to the point of Mr Sim’s arrest had been fairly passive. He had been detailed to observe the targeted unit’s kitchen window. After Officer Xu had been told of a Chinese male’s arrest, he had made his way slowly up to the unit. At his arrival, he had learnt of the arrest of a second Chinese male, Officer Xu was not involved in the search of the unit[^69].

47     When Mr Sim was required to provide samples, including that for the instant urine test[^70], where Officer Xu played a role as the sealing officer to process the two bottles of urine for formal analysis by HSA. As sealing officer, Officer Xu obtained the HSA printed labels bearing Mr. Sim’s particulars and NRIC from the IUT operator; Staff Sergeant Ong Yu Ying. He would then let Mr Sim check his particulars on the two labels and confirm that the particulars were indeed his, and then append his signature beside the two labels.

48     Subsequently, Officer Xu would proceed to seal the two labels onto the two bottles respectively in front of him. He would them place the two bottles of urine specimen on top of the metal security box. Before Officer Xu instruction of Mr Sim to deposit the two bottles in a metal security box, he had requested that Mr Xu re-check his particulars. Mr Xu had then complied with his direction to place the two urine specimen bottles into the metal security box. As the penultimate step in the process, Officer Xu would show Mr Sim that the box contained just the two bottles Mr Xu had placed, to assure that there had been no prepositioning of other urine specimen bottles. This metal security box which then be placed in the CNB facility’s freezer and locked[^71]. To obviate the possibility or suspicion of tampering, only HSA had the keys to the box[^72]. Officer Xu indicated that Mr Xu had not raised any issues nor complained during this process. He had found Mr Sim, who had **_not_** displayed any physical distress or weakness at the time, to be co-operative during the sealing process[^73]. Officer Xu had never met Mr Sim before, and did not have any dealings with the accused after the urine sample sealing process[^74].

### Allegation of smoking session in CNB toilet

49     The only other notable aspect of Officer Xu’s testimony was that Mr Sim had put it to Officer Xu that the two men had gone to the toilet with Officer Cynthia Lee and two other officers for repeated smoking sessions[^75] More extraordinarily, Mr Sim put it to the witness that Officer Xu had returned Mr Sim’s own cigarettes which had been earlier seized from his (Mr Sim’s) person. Officer Xu disagreed with that scenario.

### Evidence of PW 14 Cynthia Lee

50     Narcotics Officer Cynthia Lee was a 23-year veteran of CNB, who had attained the rank of staff sergeant, and posted to HQ Intel Division. Officer Lee had been at the scene of the accused’s arrest to provide for a contingency that a female suspect might be caught in the operation. No female suspect was found, but Officer Lee did encounter Mr Sim at the point of his arrest, and recalled asking for his ID, and received his polytechnic student card. She recalled Mr Sim to be shaking and shivering[^76]. Officer Lee denied having abused the accused, or having smoked cigarettes at CNB toilet,[^77] which was forbidden. Mr Sim had countered with his assertion that the session in the toilet was the source of his knowledge that all the escorting officers, including Officer Yuen, Officer Xu and Officer Lee smoked[^78].

### Evidence of PW15 Vinodh Pannerchilvam

51     Investigation officer Vinodh was the caretaker investigation officer who had taken over for the previous investigation officer Chong Kai Wen. IO Vinodh presented a utensil found at the scene, which was identified as a device for smoking _methamphetamine_. Mr Sim asked, and was allowed to handle the device. He then insisted that the smoking device[^79] ‘should contain water’[^80] He maintained that there was some incongruity that the device was dry despite the one and a half year gap between the time the device was seized (10 January 2018) and the date he examined the exhibit (25 July 2019).

52     IO Vinod also indicated that he had checked for with Ang Mo Kio Town Council to obtain CCTV footage of the scene of arrest at Buangkok Crescent. He had been redirected by the Town Council to police as the CCTV was one within the network of POLCAM cameras covering the area. The police unit operating the system had told him that POLCAM footage had a maximum retention period of just six months[^81]. This meant that the footage of events at 10 January 2018 had been overwritten by the time of his inquiry. In relation to the CCTV footage from the CNB premises around the vicinity of the dispenser, Officer Vinodh indicated that he had been told by CNB security, an individual whom he knew as ‘Jua Hew’ that the CCTV footage would have been overwritten in _‘about one month’_.[^82] He had thus not able to obtain any footage of the area around the time of Mr Sim’s urine procurement process.

53     In a somewhat surprising turn of events, Officer Vinodh subsequently clarified that he had mixed-up the respective overwriting dates for the CCTV systems at Lorong Buangkok and the CNB premises. He clarified that[^83]:

> Your Honour, if I may clarify? The PolCam footages (for Buangkok Crescent) are valid for about **_1 month_** and the …CNB Alpha office, the validity period was about **_6 months_** as per informed to me by CNB Security, but that could vary, which should not be longer than 6 months… \[Emphasis added\]

### Allegation of CNB officers tampering with the smoking utensil

54     Exhibit P4 was introduced via Officer Vinodh, Mr Sim raised allegations that the device had been tampered with. In cross-examination he states explicitly[^84]:

> I want establish is that …this smoking device is …contaminated with methamphetamine. So, there is also a possibility that the CNB used this water to spike me in exhibit P4.

55     Mr Sim indicated that there had been water in the device, and which was now absent in the exhibit, he thus alluded that _‘there is also a possibility that someone took the water from it and spiked me’_.[^85]

### Accused elects to remain silent

56     The prosecution closed its case after the completion of PW 15 IO Vinod’s testimony[^86]. After some explanation by the court of the prosecution’s burden to that stage of proceedings, Mr Sim acknowledged that the prosecution had indeed made out a case to answer[^87].

57     The allocution was accordingly administered for Mr Sim to make his election[^88]. Mr Sim’s initial response was that he would ‘_would like to give evidence from the witness box …but I’m not doing on affirmation_’. The learned prosecutor took the appropriate position that Mr Sim had to make an affirmation to tell the truth before he could give evidence. Despite his own use of the term ‘affirmation’ rather than ‘oath’, Mr Sim purported that his reservations were premised on his being a Christian of a Protestant denomination (which he did not specify) and proceeded to cite (but not quote from) a passage of the Biblical _Gospel According to Matthew_[^89]. He did not explain how the Scriptural passage cited would pertain to his position. When DPP Pang sought to assuage Mr Sim that while a Christian would generally swear on a Bible, there was the alternative of an affirmation as a secular _‘promise to tell the truth’_.[^90] Mr Sim responded that the Bible also stated not to ‘_unequally yoke yourself with others’_,[^91] again without explaining the context of his Biblical reference to his opposition from swearing or affirming in court proceedings.

58     I had then ordered the matter to be stood down for two hours to allow Mr Sim some space and time to fully consider his position. When court resumed, DPP Pang helpfully explained, to Mr Sim, the provisions of section 5 of the Oaths and Declarations Act (Cap 211), which permitted any person who had a _‘conscientious objection to taking an oath’_ to be instead allowed to make an affirmation. Mr Sim was thus apprised that if he maintained any ‘conscientious objection’ to taking an oath, he had an option of invoking such an objection, and proceeding to be affirmed and give evidence in his own defence.

59     Despite the options presented, Mr Sim indicated ‘I’m sorry I still make my stand’[^92] and explicitly stating ‘**_I do not wish to give evidence, Your Honour’_**[^93] Acting on an abundance of caution, the allocution was repeated and Mr Sim repeated his position that ‘I will not make any affirmation’[^94]. Having from the exercise ascertained that Mr Sim would nor consent to be either sworn or affirmed, even with assiduous explanations of his options, and his latter indication that he ‘did not wish to give evidence’, I was satisfied that Mr Sim had, for all intents and purposes, elected to remain silent.

### Whether adverse inference ought be drawn

60     In considering the implications of Mr Sim’s election to remain silent when he was called upon by the court to enter his defence to the charge against him, I would first reference the provision of 291 (3) of the present Criminal Procedure Code, which states:

> (3)    If an accused

>> (i)    after being called by the court to give evidence or after he or the advocate representing him has informed the court that he will give evidence, refuses to be sworn or affirmed; or

>> (ii)   having been sworn or affirmed, without good cause refuses to answer any question

>> the court, in deciding whether the accused is guilty of the offence, **_may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper._** \[Emphasis added\]

61     The Court of Appeal in _Took Leng How v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 70</span> elucidated on the nature and extent that proper inferences should be drawn at \[42\]-\[43\] of the judgment:

> \[42\]  In the seminal case of _Haw Tua Tau v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1981–1982\] SLR(R) 133</span>, the Privy Council opined, at \[21\], that “\[**_w\]hat inferences are proper to be drawn from an accused’s refusal to give evidence depend on the circumstances of the particular case, and is a question to be decided by applying ordinary commonsense”. Such inferences can, of course, go towards many things; the strongest inference being one of guilt itself_**: see _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> and _Syed Yasser Arafat bin Shaik Mohamed v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 977</span>.

> 43    An adverse inference should only be drawn in appropriate circumstances. A court would be in grave error if it were to draw an adverse inference of guilt if such an inference were used solely to bolster a weak case…

62      _Took Leng How_ referenced the case of _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span>. The most significant portion of the latter case, which I will refer to later in these grounds has been serendipitously highlighted in the **_original_** quote by the Court of Appeal in _Chai Chien Wei_ at \[82\] when Yong CJ, who was delivering the judgment, cited pronouncements of the House of Lords in _Murray v Director of Public Prosecutions_ (which had, in-turn, cited Lord Diplock at the Privy Council in _Haw Tua Tow v Public Prosecutor_[^95]):

> 82.    … There was ample evidence at the close of the prosecution case to warrant the learned judicial commissioner calling for the defence of the appellant. The appellant having elected to remain silent, however, the court was entitled to “draw such inferences from the refusal \[to give evidence\] as appear\[ed\] proper”: CPC s 196(2). This included, in an appropriate case, the drawing of an inference that the accused was guilty of the offence with which he was charged: _Murray v Director of Public Prosecutions_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 WLR 1</span>. In that case, Lord Slynn of Hadley amplified as follows (at 11):

>> This does not mean that the court can conclude simply because the accused does not give evidence that he is guilty. In the first place the prosecutor must establish a prima facie case – a case for him to answer. In the second place in determining whether the accused is guilty the judge or jury can draw only ‘such inferences from the refusal as appear proper’. As Lord Diplock said in _Haw Tua Tau v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1982\] AC 136</span>, 153:

>>> What inferences are proper to be drawn from an accused’s refusal to give evidence depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, and is a question to be decided by applying ordinary common sense.

> There must thus be some basis derived from the circumstances which justify the inference.

> If there is no prima facie case shown by the prosecution there is no case to answer. Equally, if parts of the prosecution case had so little evidential value that they called for no answer, a failure to deal with those specific matters cannot justify an inference of guilt.

> **_On the other hand, if aspects of the evidence taken alone or in combination with other facts clearly call for an explanation which the accused ought to be in a position to give, if an explanation exists, then a failure to give any explanation may as a matter of common sense allow the drawing of an inference that there is no explanation and that the accused is guilty_**. \[Emphasis in the original\]

### Operative presumption under the Misuse of Drugs Act

63     Mr Sim’s decision to remain silent is enormously problematic for his case. Mr Sim would of course be already be under the burden of an operative **_presumption_** reversing the burden of proof upon the detection of _methamphetamine_ in his urine. This burden of proof essentially means that where _methamphetamine_ is found in a urine sample from urine tests conducted under s 31(4)(_b_) of the MDA, the presumption in s 22 of the MDA must apply, such that both the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ of an offence under s 8(_b_) of the MDA are presumed.

64     The burden shifts to Mr Sim to rebut this presumption by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he had not knowingly consumed the drugs. Where such a presumption applies, Mr Sim’s election to remain silent and not call any witnesses in his defence, would have gravely undermined his case. This would leave **_virtually no positive evidence_** before this Court in relation to Mr Sim’s defence. Mr Sim’s silence might also lend to an inference than that had he conversely chosen to take the stand, Mr Sim’s evidence would not have stood the scrutiny of cross-examination.

### Basis for adverse inference to be drawn

65      _Per_ the analyses in the reproduced passages in _Took Leng How_ and _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_, the prosecution’s case, to say the least, was **_far_** from weak. The case had encompassed the testimonial exposition from 15 witnesses giving experiential, forensic and documentary evidence over four days, and Mr Sim’s active participation in examining these 15 witnesses is evident in some 483 pages of transcript before the point the prosecution closed its case.[^96] While Mr Sim was keen seize on perceived discrepancies in the testimony, these were superficial, and none of his analyses or theories on these areas delivered any impact sufficient to undermine the foundation of the prosecution’s case.

### Comprehensive and meticulously presented case for the prosecution

66     The prosecution’s case has spanned the entire sequence of events from factual witnesses from Mr Sim’s arrest, urine procurement, along with the custody process, and urine analysis process to detect illicit drugs. From the tenor of his questions, Mr Sim could clearly follow the case. Mr Sim would be aware that the narcotics officers involved had already stated that he (Mr Sim) had taken the water from the cooler from a disposal cup of his own choosing, and that nothing abnormal had occurred in the proximate period before and during the urine procurement process.

67     Mr Sim would have known that the analysists to have rendered their opinion that the concentration of _methamphetamine_ found was extremely high, and that it was **_unlikely_** to have been the result of ingestion of the drug at or about the time he had drunk the water at the dispense. It was thus enormously surprising that Mr Sim, after examining his witnesses in at a granular level, and in an all too often acrimonious manner, should eschew this final opportunity to ventilate his case, in his own words, as a witness for his own cause.

68     To paraphrase from the Court of Appeal’s reference to _Murray v Director of Public Prosecutions_ in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_, and applying the quoted pronouncement to the instant case, the facts adduced by the prosecution ‘_clearly call for an explanation’_ which Mr Sim ‘_ought to be in a position to give, if an explanation exists’_. Mr Sim’s failure to give any explanation ‘_may as a matter of common sense allow the drawing of an inference that there is no explanation and that the accused is guilty’_.

69     It was plain to the court that if Mr Sim had given his testimony, and been subject to cross-examination, there were live questions that he would have to answer. Among these would be the very nature of his relationship with Mr Tan Chew Wah, his co-arrestee, a known drug user who eventually pleaded guilty to an LT2 drug offence. Mr Sim’s association with Mr Tan is questionable, because he evidently did not **_live_** with Mr Tan, Mr Sim’s own registered address was listed to be situated at Block 606 Woodlands Ring Road. The unanswered question remained: _What then was Mr Sim’s drug paraphernalia doing in Mr Tan’s apartment_? Given the premises above, in such a case it was inevitable that the court would be disposed to draw an adverse inference from Mr Sim choosing to remain silent.

### Accused’s previous episode of overdose of methamphetamine

70     Mr Sim had also alluded to his aversion to abusing _methamphetamine_ after an episode in late December 2017, which had landed in at TTSH and IMH. This event was just some two weeks before his arrest on 10 January 2018, and Mr Sim claimed this ingestion was with a view to self-harm, and to have been so affected by the episode that he had resolved to eschew all use of _methamphetamine_.

71     Mr Sim first alluded to this hazardous abuse while examining PW 10; HSA analyst Ng Yue Qin where he had stated that[^97]

> So I took about 2.5 grams of methamphetamine and go went crazy…thought I lost some memories over there and I also lost my speech …occasionally I will suffer on this and also the doctor certified that if I continue to take meth again, I will be as good as a lunatic. So that is one reason why…(I)…don’t take meth again

### Whether the accused attempted self-harm

72     Mr Sim repeatedly refers to having allegedly tried to commit suicide, ‘going crazy’ and losing his memory from the episode[^98] . He returns to this while questioning PW1 5; IO Vinod Pannerchilvam, where he claims: ‘_I tried to commit suicide. After this incident, …I don’t dare to take meth again’,[^99]_ and also _‘I’ve admitted to IMH for …self-administering of methamphetamine. I consumed 2 gramme of methamphetamine to commit suicide but …I’m not able to…’_[^100] To allow a proper analysis of his claim, it would be appropriate to consider the documentary record:

73     The relevant portions of the TTSH medical report[^101] (which did not have numbered paragraphs) state:

> Mr Sim Boon Hwa was admitted to the Department of General Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital from 24 to 27 December 2017…

> **_He presented with involuntary jerking of his body, associated with anxiety, chest tightness, double vision, auditory and visual hallucinations._**

> During the initial physical examination, he was oriented in place and person, but not time. Occasional involuntary jerking of his upper limbs was noted.

> Toxicological analysis of his blood detected the presence of Amphetamine, Diazepam, Methamphetamine, Nor diazepam, Paracetamol, Promethazine.

> His diagnosis was “Drug induced psychosis and polysubstance abuse”.He was treated with a tapering dose of Diazepam and Olanzepine, an antipsychotic medication..._(information on transfer to IMH follows_) \[Emphasis added\]

74     Mr Sim was subsequently treated at IMH from 27-29 December 2017. The relevant parts of the report state:

> I refer to your request for a medical report for the above named in relation to an investigation into a case of consumption of a specified drug. The report is based on his Institute of Mental Health (IMH) medical records.

> The above named first contacted IMH in 2008, for Dormicum (a short acting benzodiazepine) an subutex (an Opioid) dependence. He had been admitted on twelve occasions to IMH since 2006 for drug related psychiatric issues. In 2017 alone, he had four admissions. For most of these admissions, he usually took self-discharge against medical advice. His last admission to IMH was from 27th to 29th December 2017. **_He apparently had consumed 2 mg of methamphetamine (ice) in one go, resulting in psychosis and limb jerks and was admitted to Tan Tocjk Deng Hospital on 24th December 2017._** His care was then transferred to IMH on 27th, His urine screen was positive for methamphetamine and benzodiazepines. He was discharged from IMH with following medications; olanzapine…, omeprazole… and diazepam… Further to his last discharge he has not attended IMH... \[Emphasis added\]

75     While the reports document an instance of a consumption of a cocktail of drugs which included a massive quantity of _methamphetamine_, which required a prolonged period of treatment TTSH and IMH from 24-29 December 2017, there is nothing in the documentary record which indicates the consumption to be predicated from a suicide or other self-harm attempt, nor does it suggest that Mr Sim would be discouraged or deterred in any way from further consumption of _methamphetamine_. Specifically, neither report documents any intimation by Mr Sim to the attending doctors and psychiatrists that his consumption of the large quantity of _methamphetamine_ on 24 December 2017 was a **_deliberate overdose_** arising from an intent to harm himself.

76     The accused claimed that his documented aversion _methamphetamine_ was medically and psychiatrically documented [^102]:

> Mr Sim:I lost something, I lost my speech, I lost some---like some, part of memories over there. **_And down there[^103], it’s stated very clearly, after December, I don’t dare to smoke---consume Ice---Ice anymore._** December 29th, as in, the IMH report.

77     As indicated above, there is nothing in the two reports which would suggest that Mr Sim had been, metaphorically speaking ‘scared straight’ by his taking what he claimed to be a potentially lethal amount of _methamphetamine_ in his ‘suicide’ bid. Mr Sim’s position of being newly inflicted with a condition of trauma-induced abstinence from _methamphetamine_ differs from what is **_actually_** documented in the actual report (or indeed reports; if the TTSH report is also considered) as set out.

78     In my view, Mr Sim is grasping at straws here. The addictive properties of _methamphetamine_ are all too notorious. Mr Sim has evidently lost many previous battles against succumbing to the allure of narcotic substances, as evidenced by the annotation in his contested charge that showed him to be eligible to be punished with a long-term class two (LT2) sentence. This is of course indicative of the extent that he had been long under the thrall of illicit drugs, as to have become eligible for LT-2 sentencing,[^104] which sits at the apex of the sentencing regime for drug consumption. The circumstantial evidence, including that of the accused being caught leaving the premises of a convicted drug offender he did not live with, (and whom he chose not to call as a witness) and leaving his own pipe in that person’s apartment show Mr Sim’s claimed onset of aversion to _methamphetamine_ is a fanciful and unpersuasive contrivance.

### Deciding not to use Tan Chew Wah as a defence witness

79     I would also note that Mr Sim had declined from calling the only other person known to be at or around the scenes of his arrest and the _sequelae_ around the holding area and lock up; Mr Tan Chew Wah. Mr Sim had repeatedly asserted that Mr Tan would be able to rebut the CNB officers’ version of events. Arrangements had been made to produce Mr Tan as a witness for the defence, with an order to bring out issued for Mr Tan’s attendance. When Mr Tan had telegraphed some hostility[^105], Mr Sim had made an adroit about-turn and indicated that he had changed his mind, and would withdraw Mr Tan as his intended witness. His motive for so doing is explicit in his submissions that Mr Tan would not be helpful to his case had he been compelled by the court to give evidence[^106].

> I did try to call (Tan Chew Wah), to witness for me and aid me in my defence. However, the witness seems to me and might to---might be for the Court, that he was not willing to testify for me due to the conflict caused by the CNB officer between the witness and I upon our arrest on 10th January 2018. **_If the witness is not willing to stand in Court to witness, the Court might mandate him to do so and hence sour the situation, resulting in inappropriate response from the witness_**.

80     Mr Sim had attributed Mr Tan’s outward hostility to CNB officers poisoning his relationship with the latter by misrepresenting Mr Sim as having played a role in his arrest. This seems impossibly contrived, as this would be absolutely inconsistent with Mr Sim’s repeated touting of Mr Tan’s testimony to be the panacea against various asserted falsehoods[^107] in the testimonies of various CNB officers

### Analysis of the accused’s defence

81     While Mr Sim declined to give evidence on his own behalf and reversed his decision to call Mr Tan, he remained keen to advance his defence case. His case was made quite evident from his detailed submissions which took up some 40 pages of transcript on the fifth day of trial[^108], and 30 pages of transcript on the sixth day of trial[^109], when orally presented.

### Presumption under s 22 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and ubiquity of spiking defences

82     Mr Sim should realise that his choices of remaining silent and not calling Mr Tan would have fatal implications on his case, given that the increased burdens imposed by the presumption under s22 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, which provides as follows:

> Presumption relating to urine test

> **22**.    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31, he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).

83     In this regard, the presumption is comprehensively expounded on by High Court in in _Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 839</span> (‘Johnson Cheng’). The relevant past of this judgment will be reproduced in detail for Mr Sim’s benefit (as an unrepresented accused person), and also because there are salient pronouncements on the treatment on **_‘spiking defences’_**. In that case, then Chief Justice Yong states:

> 15    I had previously in _Vadugaiah Mahendran v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 719</span> held that the statutory presumption in s 22 was twofold in that proof of the primary fact by the Prosecution, _ie_ a controlled drug was found in the urine as a result of both urine tests in s 31, triggered the _actus reus_ of consumption and the _mens rea_ required for the offence. **_The burden of proof hence fell upon the Defence who would have to disprove either element on a balance of probabilities. It was insufficient if the appellant merely raised a reasonable doubt._** It may be that, in most circumstances (when s 31 is read together with s 16), the Defence would find it virtually impossible to rebut the presumption of consumption and would have to rely solely upon evidence to disprove intention or knowledge of consumption. **_Therein lies the reason why the defence of “spiking” and unknowingly consuming the drinks of strangers are so commonly utilised in cases of this kind. These are allegations that are extremely easy to make but which are almost impossible to debunk_**. **_Although it is not the law that a commonly-used defence will not be accepted, a judge may be obliged to approach such a defence with greater caution and circumspection than usual in the absence of any other credible evidence:_** _PP v Hla Win_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 104</span>… \[Emphasis added\]

### Fanciful allegations of ‘spiking’ remain unsubstantiated

84     Mr Sim’s spiking defence, as discerned from the manner he had couched his cross-examination questions of prosecution witnesses, revolved around a ‘spiking’ allegation, where he had advanced theories on sinister acts of CNB officers. These officers had allegedly contrived to procure a positive result in his urine sample for the presence of _methamphetamine_, by him to ingest water from the water dispenser at CNB Cantonment HQ. Mr Sim has alleged and that he had been forced to drink cups of water proffered by a CNB officer, either whose hands had been contaminated with _methamphetamine_, or had deliberately secreted ‘**_stolen’[^110]_** drugs into the water provided.

85     One of Mr Sim’s most outlandish assertions were that the errant CNB officers had extracted water from the utensil[^111] found in the unit occupied by the aforementioned Mr Tan. To recap, Mr Sim had remarked that there had been water in the pipe and theorised that CNB officers had sucked out the water through a hole in the sealed polymer bag, and used the drawn fluid to spike the water that he had been proffered, from which he had willingly drunk two cups, and pressured to take a third.

86     In his closing submissions, Mr Sim expounds on his theory of a vast conspiracy within CNB, albeit expressed rather tentatively. Mr Sim vacillated on whether his main theory was that a narcotics officer had sucked drug tainted water from his pipe through the bag, or if the errant officer had stolen drugs from another source and secreted this into his water, Mr Sim’s view was that ‘_Both are possible’_[^112]. Mr Sim was unable to say which was the case as he had not been able to _‘witness’_ the act of tampering, but that he had fallen prey to the scheme after accepting the cups of water.

### There is no convincing reason for the CNB officers to breach protocol

87     To recapitulate, Mr Sim’s spiking defence essentially has it that after obtaining the _methamphetamine_ by the various means detailed above, the escorting officer, Jason Yuen (or an officer ‘resembling’ him) had proffered the cups of water. This differs from the escorting officer’s own account, which is that prior to the urine procurement, Mr Sim himself had made a request for water. Officer Yuen had accordingly escorted Mr Sim to the water dispenser at CNB HQ and allowed Mr Sim to take cups of water from the dispenser to drink. Officer Yuen denied having, at any time, brought water to Mr Sim, or indeed come into contact with cups of water that Mr Sim had taken to drink. After this, the duo had proceeded to the toilet for Mr Sim’s urine procurement procedure. Officer Yuen did not recall any remarkable event during the procurement.

88     For his case, Mr Sim principally relies on Exhibit D1, the letter he had written Sim from prison dated 14 February 2018. In this letter, he complains of egregious misconduct by the CNB officers who arrested him, stating that he had first drunk ‘3-4 cups’ of water from the water dispenser, and after being threatened again, he was forced to drink water by another CNB officer. After the final cup of water, he had experienced strange symptoms that appeared to have rendered him to be under the influence of pychoactive substances.

### Alleged motives for framing accused are bizarre and spurious

89     There was no cogent reason for the court to reject Officer Yuen’s testimony. The evidence shows that Narcotics Officer Yuen was a 25-year veteran CNB officer, who had had no previous contact with Mr Sim. There was no rational basis to suspect that he might have any personal reason to frame Mr Sim or otherwise implicate him in a drug offence. There was also no reason to suspect that Officer Yuen, given his experience, would fail to apprehend the risks of deviating from procedure, or otherwise seek to breach the usual protocol and bring the water to a suspect. All indications pointed to Officer Yuen merely performed his duties as an escorting officer and allowed Mr Sim’s seemingly innocuous request for a drink of water before giving his urine sample.

### Accused’s behaviour not especially atypical of intoxicated drug suspects

90     To be clear, it would be difficult for this court to fathom any possibility that Officer Yuen would have the motivation to undertake such a brazen act of secreting _methamphetamine_ into Mr Sim’s water merely from Mr Sim’s own rude and obstructive behaviour at the point of his arrest. This is particularly where Mr Sim had admitted to nothing much more than merely being uncooperative, and prone to giving angry glances to the officers at the point of his arrest[^113].

91     Mr Sim’s admitted truculent behaviour would be sadly **_quite typical_** of drug suspects, many of whom would be in the thrall of their habit and prone to display heightened stimulation or dulled senses (depending on the drugs abused), and thus not be expected to behave in a civil and respectful manner. Mr Sim had not claimed to any truly egregious conduct such as attempting to assault, or hurl abuse at the arresting or escorting officers. It would therefore be bizarre that Officer Yuen (or an officer resembling him) would take special offence to Mr Sim’s behaviour to the point of the narcotics officer being so ‘triggered’ toward a retributive response as to becoming a criminal himself. Even more inconceivable would be the notion of this officer committing such a gravely scandalous and criminal act in premises he was familiar with, and where he would expect to find his activities to be within coverage of CCTV surveillance.

### Accidental contamination is extremely unlikely

92     On Mr Sim’s alternative theory that Officer Yuen had handled him _methamphetamine_ tainted water as he (Officer Yuen) had handled drugs before the urine test, this theory runs against Officer Yuen’s sworn testimony that he had not handled any _methamphetamine_ on the day of the arrest. Given that Officer Yuen would have used gloves in any event, there would have been no danger of **_accidental contamination_** even if he had been involved in an earlier operation where drugs had been seized and handled. The concentration found of 30 300 nanograms to 33 600 nanograms per millilitre of urine, are some **_60-67 times_** the reference cut off of 500ng, which would make accidental contamination from Officer Yuen to be most unlikely.

93     On Mr Sim’s other theory that Mr Yuen (or another officer resembling him) had deliberately spiked his drinking water with _methamphetamine_, Mr Sim’s theory had Officer Yuen, or his lookalike, surreptitiously spit _methamphetamine_\-tainted fluid into the water proffered. In my view, the notion that the CNB officer would take such a bizarre risk just to frame a suspect seems hopelessly improbable. The concentration of _methamphetamine_ detected in this case alone would make it utterly doubtful that Officer Yuen, or the officer resembling him, would (or could) have stored the drug in the buccal cavity of his mouth waiting for an opportune moment to spit out the drug into the water to be proffered to the unwitting Mr Sim.

### Grossly unlikely scenario of methamphetamine obtained from water drawn from smoking utensil in evidence bag

94     Equally implausible is Mr Sim’s final accusation of the aforesaid unknown Chinese CNB officer resembling Officer Yuen having somehow extracted _methamphetamine_ tainted water from the CNB polymer bag containing the improvised smoking utensil and then proceeding to surreptitiously administered the extracted fluid to the cups of water he drank. This begged the question of **_how_** the errant officer would have **_known_** the smoking utensil or ‘pipe’ (P7) whether with or without the traces of water he claimed to be present, contained _methamphetamine_, and indeed how Mr Sim would have known there was still water in the utensil at the point of his arrest in the first place, if his last admitted use of the ‘pipe’ was some weeks ago. Mr Sim’s account, which did not differ from the prosecution’s case, had been that the smoking utensil had been seized at the fourth floor, upon a search of Mr Tan’s premises, after his (Mr Sim’s) interception at the ground floor. It is also common ground that when arrested, Mr Sim was found with neither drugs nor drug paraphernalia on his person.

95     Given the above, the other obvious question would be how this extracted water of presumably a residual amount of _methamphetamine_ would have yielded a concentration exceeding by **_60 to 67_** times the amount needed to secure a positive finding of the presence of _methamphetamine_. All in all, Mr Sim would have to contend with the fact that the evidence of the IUT slip, HSA certificates of two analysts (along with the testimonial evidence of one), and the evidence of Officers Jason Yuen and Benjamin Xu all present a unified and coherent picture that the collection and analysis of Mr Sim’s urine had occurred without incident.

### Failure to rebut presumption of consumption

96     Other than Mr Sim’s utter failure to introduce any evidence to displace the presumptive burden, the prosecution’s objective evidence is unassailable. The level of _methamphetamine_ has been put beyond doubt by the evidence of two analysts Ng Xue Jin and Evelyn Goh. Ms Ng had given evidence that Mr Sim’s urine sample contained a concentration of _methamphetamine_ which would be considered high. With normal metabolic processes in play, the analyst had found it ‘highly unlikely’ that such a high positive urine result could have occurred from the manner and pattern of _methamphetamine_ ingestion described by Mr Sim. As urine was the product of waste products after metabolism, which had been excreted into the kidneys and passed to the bladder. Her evidence was that _methamphetamine_ would ordinarily remain detectable in urine one to three days after consumption.

### Toxicological evidence does not allow time for spiking to have occurred

97     The analysts’ combined evidence would fatally undermine Mr Sim’s theory, which is fundamentally premised on the crucial aspect of him having been being tested moments after the alleged spiking. Officer Yuen’s account also has mere moments occurring between the point the party stopped for water on the way to procure Mr Sim’s urine. Give the effluxion of such a short span of time of several minutes from the point of consuming the alleged tainted water, I found it hopelessly improbable Mr Sim could process _methamphetamine_ within the quantities found in the urine sample, from the spiked water, with the contents of the drink being fully processed by his kidneys, and the metabolised waste products reaching and collecting in his bladder for excretion to the provided container, within these few minutes.

98     Mr Sim’s response to this critical point was a rather feeble suggestion that his metabolism was atypical. Also, he had ‘_an empty stomach’_ and had drunk six to seven cups of water and had been in a ‘_cold air-conditioner environment’_.[^114] and the analysis should thus be ‘_not able to insist that it is impossible to contain such high concentration of methamphetamine on the urine sample’[^115]_ within the short time frame he had stated Ms Ng had characterised this scenario presented by Mr Sim to be still be ‘_highly unlikely’_. Mr Sim’s arguments are, in my view, wholly unpersuasive, given the Mr Sim’s claim of unwitting ingestion within an hour of collection. It is unfathomable, in the context of the forensic evidence, that he could have been found with fully metabolised _methamphetamine_ yielding concentration of **_60-67 times_** of the minimum cut-off of 500 nanograms, in the collected urine sample from the manner of ingestion described.

### Mr Sim’s allegations of CNB impropriety do not change complexion of case

99     Among other serious allegations mounted, Mr Sim has alleged that the CNB has deliberately withheld and destroyed CCTV footage at the scene of his arrest and his urine procurement. He contends that the CNB had re-routed a letter he had drafted from prison to AGC as a cynical ploy to buy time to allow the IO time to cause the CCTV footage to rendered unusable by court proceedings.

100    In this regard, I accept that the CCTV footage of the scene of arrest and CNB HQ has been overwritten despite efforts to obtain and preserve them once the CNB and AGC became aware that Mr Sim considered them significant to his defence. I accept that the testimonies of Investigation Officers Chong Kai Wen and subsequent IO Vinod Pannerchilvam do differ in the retention times for the footages. I do recognise that both officers have no **_direct_** knowledge of the actual retention times, and merely reported what they were told by the persons contacted. The respective officers had raised the queries at different points of time. It is entirely possible that the officers spoke to different individuals, and at least one of these sources might have provided erroneous or inaccurate information. There is no circumstantial basis to believe that these sources acted in bad faith in supplying the information. As a result of IO Vinodh’s inexplicable wavering in his recollection of the overwriting times of the two CCTV systems, I would, in any case, find IO Chong’s account to be more reliable of the two. While I would not characterise Officer Vinodh to be cavalier in giving his evidence, such a slip is, nevertheless concerning given the gravity of the proceedings, where it would be all too evident to an investigation officer that his testimony should be clear, precise and unequivocal[^116]. In any case, the footage, even if recovered, is not likely to have provided evidence helpful to Mr Sim. This is so, given the nature of the evidence presented by the prosecution, especially the forensic and metabolic evidence, which will be elaborated on below. For the former, the significance of the footage would have been doubtful, as Mr Sim’s arrest seemed absent of any notable incident.

101    In relation to the CCTV footage in CNB HQ, it is likewise unclear how this might assist Mr Sim’s case. Officer Chong had been told unequivocally that the CCTV at CNB had ‘a validity of 30 days’[^117] but Officer Vinodh was told of a longer validity of ‘not more than six months’. Where Mr Sim’s defence revolved around this contention that he received a ‘spiked’ drink at the water fountain, IO Chong has testified that he was informed that the water fountain could not be seen on the CCTV footage, and would not have assisted in Mr Sim’s defence[^118].

### Analysing ‘spiking’ defences with caution

102     _Johnson Cheng’s_ case, which was referenced earlier cautions that the defence of “spiking” and unknowingly consuming the drinks of strangers are commonly utilised, and that **_‘_**_(t)hese are allegations that are extremely easy to make but which are almost impossible to debunk._ Following this, _‘a judge may be obliged to approach such a defence with greater caution and circumspection than usual in the absence of any other credible evidence…’._ Given this, I was mindful to accord the appropriate degree of care in assessing Mr Sim’s ‘spiking’ defence. As mentioned above, Mr Sim did not shake any **_substantive_** aspect of the prosecution’s case which would have given pause for doubt that the various factual witnesses had rendered anything less than a complete and truthful recollections of material events.

103    In this regard, Mr Sim’s allegations are, in stark contrast, especially grandiose, given that he has alleged an agency-wide conspiracy in CNB. Mr Sim’s allegations include IO Chong deliberately refraining from acting on his letter from prison, in a bid to allow him, or unspecified CNB officers, time to destroy the CCTV footage to cover up officer Yuen’s nefarious acts.

104    Upon careful analysis, rather than an unprecedented CNB-wide conspiracy to incriminate drug suspects and then stymie their attempts to clear themselves, the circumstances are altogether more mundane. Mr Sim’s letter while dated 14 February 2018, was received by CNB on 16 March 2018. This is evidenced by a stamp and date by the CNB registry, as well as by a stamp by Singpost reflecting the date 15 March 2018. Hence, by the time CNB received Mr Sim’s missive, more than two months had elapsed since Mr Sim’s arrest on 10 January 2018, with the probability of the CCTV footage having been over-written, from IO Chong’s account[^119].

105    Ultimately, it still remains unclear to me whether Mr Sim **_believed_** his own defence. If he did, he would have realised that his recollection of unidentified CNB officers having insulting and abused him, taking him for a smoke and spiking his water could well also have been the results of a fevered and delirious mind under the influence of _methamphetamine_. It should be evident that the symptoms of _methamphetamine_ toxicity include agitation and paranoia. Mr Sim’s incoherent account seems more an attempt to make sense of events from figments of skewed recollections from a fevered mind labouring under the influence of 30 300-33600 nanograms of _methamphetamine_ per millilitre of his urine, from his prior consumption of this drug.

### Conviction on DAC-902299-2018

106    All considered, I found that the prosecution to have had proven his case beyond reasonable doubt, and accused to be guilty as charged of the offence specified in the proceed charge. Ms Sim was accordingly convicted of the offence under section 8(b)(ii) Misuse of Drugs for his consumption of the specified drug _methamphetamine_, for which he was liable to a LT2 sentence of a minimum of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

### Accused’s agreement to plead guilty to two proceeded charges

107    After considerable deliberation, Mr Sim signalled that he would plead guilty to two proceeded charges. Both related to his failure to report for urine tests on 5 and 8 January 2018, which were incidentally just five and two days before his arrest on 10 January. Mr Sim gave his unqualified admission to the following facts[^120]:

> 2    On 10 January 2018 at about 10:15 am, the accused was arrested by CNB Intelligence officers at the 1st floor lift landing of Blk 986C Buangkok Crescent.

> **_Facts relating to the 4th and 5th ‘Failing to Report For Urine Test’ charges (DAC-916480-2018 and DAC-916481-2018)_**

> 3    On 18 August 2017, the accused was placed under compulsory supervision for 24 months with effect from 18 August 2017 to 17 August 2019 by virtue of Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed).

> 4    Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(f) of the aforesaid Regulations, the accused is required to present himself for urine test at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters on every Monday and Friday of each month from 9.30am to 10:00pm commencing on 21 August 2017 as directed by his Supervision Officer except on public holiday. However, the accused had failed to report for his urine test on 5 occasions.

> 5    The accused contravened the said Regulation when he failed to present himself for his urine test **_on 5 January 2018 and 8 January 2018_** at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters without any valid reasons. \[Emphasis added\]

110    As would be evident from his antecedent and DRC supervision record, Mr Sim had been involved in the full suite of drug-activities, spanning the consumption, possession, trafficking of drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia. Mr Sim’s habit extended to a range of drugs, which included _buprenorphine_, _methamphetamine_ and _diamorphine_, and spans a period of some 24 years from April 1994[^123] to January 2018. Notably, the present consumption charge is Mr Sim’s **_second_** LT 2 conviction, as he had already been sentenced on 12 August 2013 to the mandatory minimum of seven years; imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

### Indicative tariff for subsequent LT2

111    The case of _Cheang Geok Lin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 548</span>; <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 5</span>, has expressed an indicative sentencing point of **_8 years’ imprisonment_** (with no proposed change to the mandatory minimum of 6 strokes imprisonment) where an accused person had committed a second LT2 offence. The relevant part of _Cheang’s_ case is reproduced in detail for Mr Sim’s benefit[^124].

> 34    With respect to the LT-2 Charge, there were two factors that warranted a sentence above the mandatory minimum. The first was the fact that the Appellant had committed a further LT-2 consumption offence despite already facing a similar LT-2 charge after his initial arrest on 24 August 2014. **_There were a number of precedents that suggested that the sentence for a second LT-2 offence should be a term of imprisonment of about eight years:_**

>> (a)    In _PP v Krishnasamy s/o Suppiah_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 321</span>, Senior District Judge See Kee Oon sentenced an offender who pleaded guilty to two LT-2 consumption charges and one drug possession _simpliciter_ charge to seven years’ imprisonment for the first LT-2 consumption charge and eight years’ imprisonment for the second LT-2 consumption charge. It appears that a higher sentence for the second LT-2 consumption charge was imposed in order to take into account the aggravating factor that the offender “had reoffended while on bail and committed a further LT-2 offence” (at \[8\]). The sentences were upheld by Steven Chong J on appeal to the High Court (see _Krishnasamy s/o Suppiah v PP_ Magistrate’s Appeal No 217 of 2011).

>> (b)    In _Yusran bin Yusoff v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 74</span>, Choo Han Teck J upheld the sentence of eight years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for a second LT-2 offence. At \[7\], Choo J agreed with the district judge that the appellant’s recidivism justified such a sentence.

> 35    The second factor that warranted a sentence above the mandatory minimum was the lack of remorse evident from the fact that the Appellant had committed the offence disclosed in the LT-2 Charge while on bail and indeed after absconding…

> 37    The DJ imposed a sentence of eight years and six months’ imprisonment for the LT-2 Charge. **_If I were to approach this on the basis that he could have been sentenced to a term of eight years just on the basis that this was the second LT-2 charge, this would mean that the DJ increased the sentence by a further six months on the ground that the Appellant had re-offended after absconding on bail._** In my judgment, this was not manifestly excessive. I therefore affirmed the sentence imposed by the DJ for the LT-2 Charge. \[Emphasis added\]

### Mitigation

112    My Sim did not give any substantive mitigation save to say that he had ‘I paid my due’[^125] for his past offences.

### No uplift in accused’s sentence as accusations against CNB officers could be from distorted recollection of events from methamphetamine toxicity

113    The learned DPP expressed his view that Mr Sim had ‘_demonstrated an utter lack of remorse’_ in the manner he had conducted himself at trial and had ‘_run a spurious defence’_ where he had _‘made wild accusations’[^126]_. Looking at Mr Sim’s protracted cross examination where he had, all too often, used an abrasive and hostile tone, I would appreciate the learned DPP’s adverse impression of Mr Sim’s conduct at trial. Taking a more nuanced perspective, I do wonder if Mr Sim’s conduct at trial might have been occasioned by his **_inability to recall_** the actual events, which then motivated him to make rather bizarre allegations of having been offered ‘spiked’ water in the improbable permutations mentioned above. This may also have led to his narrating an incoherent backdrop of narcotics officers behaving in a truly outlandish and uncharacteristic manner.

114    As I have previously indicated, Mr Sim’s account was plainly fantastical, and I found no rational reason to accept Mr Sim’s rather surreal version of events, which included not just the spiking of his water. He had also made reference to having had a communal smoking[^127] session (or sessions[^128]) with several male **_and_** one female CNB officers in a toilet, and where at least one of the same set of escorting officers had also inexplicably visited ‘curry-drinking’ abuse on him. Further, as alluded to above, Mr Sim seemed to have been affected by the _methamphetamine_ toxicity (of which there is unrefuted forensic proof of the metabolism of a massive dosage that had been circulating in his bloodstream). _Methamphetamine_ is well known to have profound psycho-active properties, and thus may have affected his perception and recollection of events at the material time.

115    This being the case, I could never be sure which parts of Mr Sim’s defence, which unfortunately included the disproven and scurrilous allegations against CNB officers, were the result of distorted recollections, which had cognitively been imprinted into a version of events that Mr Sim had accepted to seem to be ‘real’. Mr Sim has also alluded to a drug-induced ‘psychosis’ at the time. He states in his submissions[^129]:

> At that point of time, I was talking to myself. It is… due to the 3 cups of water a form of …psychosis, not mental unsoundness. … I’m not into medical term. For me…mentally unsoundness is like talking to myself. But it’s some sort of **_psychosis_**. I recently …found out. I was talking to myself at Cantonment Police Station. And Benjamin Xu has saw it …before the sealing,,,during and after the sealing of my urine…

116    As can be seen in the above and other passages reproduced in this judgment, Mr Sim had repeatedly alluded to losing his memory after drug use, albeit his references to problems in recall were in relation to the December 2017 episode where he had allegedly attempted self-harm. He seemed to lack any insight that his abilities of accurate recollection might have been similarly impaired on 10 January 2018 as well during his self-described ‘psychotic’ state, when a large amount of _methamphetamine_ was in circulation in his system.

117    In this regard, the court would certainly have benefitted from further medical reports other than the rather sketchy TTSH and IMH reports mentioned above. I would have, in particular, been more comfortable if I had recourse to a specific medical opinion on Mr Sim’s likely state of mind **_at the time_** of the collection of his urine sample, rather than in respect of his previous episode of _methamphetamine_ abuse in December 2017. Given, however, Mr Sim’s limited resources (the TTSH and IMH reports were actually procured by the investigation officer after Mr Sim informed of his attendances to the respective institutions), and the nature of criminal proceedings being adversarial, rather than inquisitorial (which would have allowed more leeway for the court to direct reports on its own motion), I was constrained to form my view from the available documents, as well as the testimonies of HSA analysts. I was also of the view that ignoring this likelihood that Mr Sim might be suffering from an altered mental state at the time would have been unfair to Mr Sim, as he would otherwise be imputed with a more venomous motive for conducting an unnecessarily belligerent defence, and casting scandalous and toxic accusations that he **_knew_** to be false. Nevertheless, I believe my view is sufficiently fortified by the TTSH report stating that in his previous episode of _methamphetamine_ abuse, Mr Sim had ‘_presented with involuntary jerking of his__body_, associated with **_anxiety_**, _chest tightness, double vision_, **_auditory and visual hallucinations_**’ \[Emphasis added\]. Given the evidence of ingestion of a high concentration of same psychoactive narcotic drug on 10 January 2018, it would not be speculative to extrapolate that he had suffered from the same **_persecutory_** and **_delusional_** symptoms.

118    The best indication of that Mr Sim was operating under such delusions was his insistence that Officer Yuen was **_not_** the **_‘real’_** officer he had dealt with and that the person who had been there had been an officer who ‘**_looked like’_** Officer Yuen. Mr Sim would have realised that his unwavering insistence that the CNB had planted an imposter to attend the trial as a witness would have made his account **_exponentially_** more **_implausible_**. Mr Sim having known this, and his yet persisting that this was indeed the case, seemed to indicate that there were at least parts of his account that he genuinely believed to be true. This thus differs from a situation where there has been clear and cynical pre-meditation to cast scurrilous aspersions against public officers that the offender **_knew_** to be entirely false. Hence, I would give Mr Sim a measure of benefit of doubt and **_not_** impose an uplift in sentence for this aspect of his case.

### Accused not penalised with higher sentence for claiming trial

119    I accepted DPP Jamie Pang’s sentencing recommendation for a sentence of eight years and **_six_** months, with no change to the mandatory six strokes of the cane[^130] to be generally fair, after a seven day trial. This is premised on the understanding that the indicative eight-year imprisonment point for a subsequent LT2 consumption offence pronounced in _Johnson Cheng_ was with reference to a plead guilty (frequently abbreviated to ‘PG’) situation.

120    A notional sentencing **_discount_** is usually accorded for PG cases, where it is recognised that the plea has saved the prosecution, witnesses and court, time that would be otherwise expended for a trial. It should be clear to Mr Sim[^131] that the sentence proposed, for which an additional six months was recommended, was not to ‘punish’ him for claiming trial. The reason was simply because Mr Sim could **_not_** be accorded any such notional discount applicable where the accused had greatly expedited the proceeding with an early plea of guilt, affording the saving of time and resources.

121    Notwithstanding my sense that the sentence proposed was, in my view, entirely appropriate as a stand-alone post-trial sentence for a subsequent LT2 offence, I was mindful that Mr Sim also faced two more proceeded charges[^132] for failure to report for urine testing (commonly abbreviated to FRUT) to provide a sample. One of these sentences must, by operation of law, run consecutively with LT 2 charge; DAC-902299-2018, that Mr Sim had been convicted.

122    After a careful analysis, I further attenuated Mr Sim’s final sentence to eight years’ and **_three_** months (along with the mandatory 6 strokes of the cane) with a view to deriving a just and proportionate global sentence when the sentences for other charges are factored in. The detailed basis is set out below.

### Basis for sentence for the FRUT charges

123    I would note that this is Mr Sim’s third set of defaults for offences contrary to Regulation 12(30(f) of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, as the antecedent records Mr Sim had also failed to report for a series of scheduled urine tests in 1995 and 2013. He had received sentences of two months in 1995[^133].

124    For his second set of offices of a similar nature where he was convicted on 13 August 2013[^134], Mr Sim received a significantly harsher sentence for the single proceeded charge (with Mr Sim agreeing to the two remaining FRUT charges being taken into consideration) of **_one year’s_** imprisonment.

125    The learned prosecutor had asked for a sentence **_in excess_** of the one-year term that Mr Sim had previously been sentenced to in 2013, but left the degree of the uplift to the court[^135]. In this instance, I considered that Mt Sim would be consecutively sentenced for at least one of the FRUT charges with the repeat LT2 charge, and after due consideration, felt it appropriate to impose not **_more_** than the one-year imprisonment term that had been imposed previously for Mr Sim’s earlier FRUT offence. On the other hand, the factual matrix of Mr Sim’s case, including the fact that he faced multiple charges[^136] for his failure to report for urine test in a period spanning 24 November 2017 to 8 January 2018, just two days before his arrest in the CNB operation, would make it eminently inappropriate to impose a term **_below_** the one year term imposed for the 2013 FRUT charges. The facts do not suggest that Mr Sim, who was of course convicted for _methamphetamine_ consumption of the detected level mentioned above, was remorseful for these offences, nor on any apparent path of repentance when he was arrested.

### Deriving the global sentence

126    The case of _Mohammed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> enjoins the sentencing court to ensure that the aggregate ‘global’ sentence was neither ‘substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved’[^137]. The court was also to avoid the imposition of punishments where ‘the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects’[^138].

127    Considering the above with a view to imposing a just and proportionate sentence, I imposed a sentenced to 8 years and 3 months, with the mandatory minimum of 6 strokes of the cane for DAC-902299-2018; the LT-2 drug consumption, charge where Mr Sim had claimed trial, and one-year terms of imprisonment for FRUT charges DAC-916480-2018 and DAC-916481-2018. I also ordered DAC-902299-2018 and DAC-916481-2018 to run consecutively, giving Mr Sim Boon Hwa a global; term of **_9 years 3 months_** and 6 strokes. As the accused had spent a considerable period of time in remand, I considered it appropriate to backdate his sentence to take effect from the date of his first remand; 18 January 2018.

128    Ultimately, Mr Sim should recognise that I have given him substantial benefit of doubt that his running of a battery of brazenly scandalous (but hopelessly improbable) accusations against CNB officers, especially Officers Yuen, Xu, Lee and the investigation officers, were not actuated by malice or bad faith, but from distorted impressions from impaired faculties while he was in a _methamphetamine_\-induced haze. Had I found otherwise, it would have been only proper to impose a significantly higher sentence for the LT-2 consumption charge.

129    On the second limb of _Shouffee_, I noted Mr Sim’s parlous antecedent history and the fact that he was by no means a youthful offender, but had attained middle-age, and thus was convinced that the punishment accorded was not _‘a crushing sentence not in keeping with his record and prospects’_. Rather, considering the uplift of just three months from the indicative PG guideline sentence of eight years’ imprisonment for a repeat LT2 offence after a prolonged trial, and maintaining the FRUT sentence at the same tariff as his 2013 FRUT sentence, I would be of the view that the global imprisonment sentence of nine years and three months’ imprisonment leant far more heavily on the side of leniency than harshness.

130    The accused remains in remand.

[^2]: This was a somewhat surprising development as Tan Chew Wah was repeatedly invoked as a critical witness who could verify the accused’s account of events. For example, see Notes of Evidence, Day 2, pages 59-61, where Mr Tan is apparently to be relied on to prove that Officer Jason Yuen did not escort Mr Sim or collect his urine sample, but that another ostensibly older looking officer had undertaken that role.

[^104]: To ensure that Mr Sim would understand the nature and consequence of any plea he might give, the charge merely stated that Mr Sim had, as a result of a previous LT 1 conviction for the specified drug _Buprenorphine_, become **eligible: ** for an LT2 sentence. The full extent of Mr Sim’s drug record showing that he was in fact a **second time: ** LT2 offender only became known to me **after: ** his conviction. This fact is, of course, not relied on for my analysis of his conviction, since I was only cognisant of his full antecedent history at the sentencing stage, **after: ** I had convicted him.

That he passed me 3 cups of water to drink. \[Emphasis added\]

[^111]: At Notes of Evidence, Day 6, page 20, lines 15-24, Mr Sim states (repetitions and pauses edited for flow and clarity): Court: Then somehow the officer sucked the water from the pipe.

My main issue is that, on that very day… I have questioned …all the Prosecution witness…is there a possibility that they steal anything from the house.

[^116]: To recap, IO Vinod recalls, in the later part of his cross-examination, to being told that the timeline to overwriting of the CNB CCTV to be somewhat longer of up to **six months: **, a reversal of his earlier position of **one month: ** for the footage to be recoverable. I found IO Vinod’s admission on his mistake on flipping the overwrite periods of the respective CCTV systems in Lorong Buangkok and CNB to be quite perplexing, since he had undergone intense questioning by Mr Sim on the respective CCTV to an extent that expended more than twenty pages of transcript (NE Day 2, page 79 to page 101), before admitting his apparent mistake. I also note that IO Vinod, unlike IO Chong, was unable to give any insight on the positioning of the CCTV at CNB. I would therefore find IO Chong’s evidence to be more coherent and complete.

[^117]: Notes of Evidence Day 1, page 108, lines 4-9

[^118]: For completeness, I should add that Mr Sim had raised other perceived irregularities in his very detailed submissions. These; which include his remarks on the visual acuity of narcotics officers surveilling him at Mr Tan’s residence, do not really engage the pertinent issues of the case against him. To avoid undue prolixity in these grounds, I have eschewed from addressing submissions which I found to be of dubious relevance.

[^119]: As indicated, I do have, for the reasons cited, have reservations about Officer Vinodh’s recall on this aspect.

[^120]: Exhibit PS-1, admitted on 23 September 2019.

[^121]: The DAC/MAC charge numbers of Mr Sim’s antecedent record have not been included, as they are **not: ** germane to the discussion.

[^122]: The date appears to have been erroneously recorded, since the TIC was indexed to the trafficking charge at entry 12, which was dealt with on 12 August 2013.

[^123]: Albeit that his first criminal conviction was in November 1995.

[^124]: This to facilitate a better understanding of the basis for the sentence imposed, given that Mr Sim acts in person.

[^125]: Notes of Evidence, Day 7 page 52, lines 9-14.

[^126]: Notes of Evidence, Day 7, page 44, lines 14-20

[^127]: Another aspect which points toward the event being a memory ‘manufactured’ from a drug-induced delirium was the fact of Mr Sim’s unreliable recall in claiming that Officer Yuen favoured _Kunang Galang_ (where he likely meant _Gudang Garam_) an Asian brand of clove cigarettes. Officer Yuen has countered that his preferred brand was _Lucky Strike_, and could if asked to, retrieve his pack from the witness room. At Notes of Evidence Day 2, page 62, lines 12-19

[^128]: The actual number of smoking visitations in the CNB toilet is unclear, as all references are drawn from Mr Sim’s questions to witnesses where he varied between singular and multiple toilet smoking visits. In this regard, Mr Sim has of course eschewed giving evidence himself, foreclosing all opportunities to clarify or examine him on this point. Mr Sim states that Officer Xu ‘_went in a couple of time’_ to the toilet to smoke at Notes of Evidence Day 2, page 136, lines 3-4.
