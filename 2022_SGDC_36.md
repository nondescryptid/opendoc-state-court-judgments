\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9021/2022/01.\]

22 February 2022

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Muhammad Roszaiman Bin Rosli, a 32 years-old male Singapore citizen faced five changes under s 15 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed)(“RTA”) and five charges under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed)(“MVA”).

2       On 27 January 2022, he pleaded guilty to three charges under s 15 of the RTA and three charges under s 3(1) of the MVA and admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification. The remaining four charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.

3       After carefully considering the accused’s plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and its reply, I sentenced the accused as follows:

> (a)     a fine of $500 in default two days’ imprisonment for each charge under s 15 of the RTA and

> (b)     a fine of $600 in default three days’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months with effect from date of conviction for each charge under s 3(1) of the MVA.

His total fine was $3,300 in default 15 days and a disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months with effect from date of conviction _ie_ from 27 January 2022.

4       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against the order of disqualification on 8 February 2022. He had paid the fines in full on 27 January 2022.

5       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

6       The Complainant is one Norris Ang, an officer from the Land Transport Authority.

7       The accused is Muhammad Roszaiman Bin Rosli.

#### Facts relating to the 5th and 6th charges

8       On 28 June 2021 at about 8.38 am along Central Expressway (CTE), the Complainant stopped the motorcar SGU2291U (“the motorcar”) and discovered that the motorcar was being driven without a valid vehicle licence (road tax) and insurance.

9       The accused is the registered owner of the motorcar since 17 January 2019 and was the driver of the motorcar at the material time on 28 June 2021.

10     The vehicle licence for the motorcar had expired on 6 May 2021. The insurance for the motorcar had expired on 10 May 2021. There was no policy of insurance or security in respect of third-party risks as complies with the MVA when the motorcar was used on 28 June 2021.

#### Facts relating to the 7th to 10th charges

11     The motorcar was further detected being used on the following two later occasions:

> (a)     Passing through an Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantry along CTE on 30 June 2021 at about 7.05 am; and

> (b)     Passing through an ERP gantry along CTE on 6 July 2021 at about 7.51 am.

12     The vehicle licence of the motorcar was subsequently renewed on 8 July 2021. The insurance for the motorcar was subsequently renewed on 7 July 2021.

13     The accused admitted that he was the driver of the motorcar on 30 June 2021 and 6 July 2021. There was no valid vehicle licence nor insurance when the Defendant used the motorcar on the two later occasions on 30 June 2021 and 6 July 2021.

14     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed the following offences:

> (a)     Three counts of using a vehicle without a vehicle licence, an offence under s 15 of the RTA and

> (b)     Three counts of using a vehicle without insurance coverage, an offence under s 3(1) of the MVA.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

15     The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 15 of the RTA is a fine not exceeding $2,000.

16     The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (“MVA”) is fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. S 3(3) of the MVA provides that a person convicted of an offence under this section shall be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the RTA for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

## Antecedents

17     The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

18     The Prosecution sought a fine of between $500 to $600 for each charge as well as the mandatory 12 months’ disqualification order for all classes of vehicles for the offences under s 3(1) MVA.

## Mitigation

19     In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused stated that this was the first time he had committed the offences. He was not aware that it was serious case and sought a lighter sentence.

## My decision on sentence

### S 15 RTA

20     The usual sentence imposed for a first offender for an offence under s 15 of the RTA is a fine of between $500 to $700.

### S 3(1) of the MVA

21     The usual sentence for a first offender for an offence under s 3(1) of the MVA is a fine ranging from $600 to $800 and the mandatory disqualification for a period of for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

22     The meaning of “special reasons” was considered by the High Court in the cases of _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span> and _Prathib s/o M Balan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1066</span>. The High Court held that the phrase “special reasons” has a narrow meaning. Only reasons connected to the offence and not reasons related to the offender are to be considered. The fact that an offender requires the driving licence to earn a living is not considered as a special reason.

23     In the present case, there was no special reasons relating to the offence provided by the accused. The accused merely stated that this was the first time he had committed the offences. He further stated that he was not aware that it was serious case and sought a lighter sentence. Accordingly, I found that there were no special reasons present in the case for me not to make the disqualification order pursuant to s 3(3) of the MVA.

24     In the present case, the accused had pleaded guilty to the three proceeded charges under s 15 of the RTA. In respect of these charges, as the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty at the first court mention, taking these factors into consideration I imposed the lower end of the usual fines imposed namely a fine of $500 in default two days imprisonment for each charge.

25     Similarly, as the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty at the first mention and the fine proposed by the Prosecution was within the normal tariff, I imposed a fine $600 in default three days’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months from the date of his conviction for each charge.
