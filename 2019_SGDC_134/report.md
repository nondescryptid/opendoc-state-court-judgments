(ii)     One charge of attempting to cause hurt to a police officer under s 332 read with s 511 PC;

(iii)     One charge of driving his lorry without due care and attention under s 65(a) RTA;

(iv)     One charge of abandoning his lorry in the middle of a service road under s 122 RTA.

## THE FACTS

3       All the offences (including those taken into consideration) happened on 1 Aug 17.

4       At about 11.29 am that day, the Accused drove his lorry (GBE6664U) along Yishun Central towards Yishun Avenue 2. Near to lamp post 62, he drove in the middle of two lanes. He then attempted to drive between two cars. While doing so, the front right side of his lorry collided into and side-swiped the front left bumper of the car on the right. The car had scratches on the left front portion of above the front left tyre, its left wing mirror was damaged, and the left front bumper was dislodged. No one was injured.

5       After the collision and side-swipe, the Accused did not stop his lorry. He drove away from the scene of the accident.

6       At about 12.27 pm, the Accused was driving along Woodlands Avenue 4. He failed to keep a proper look-out for vehicles in front of him, and collided into the rear of a taxi in front of him. The taxi had scratches, dents and cracks at its right rear portion.

7       After the collision, the Accused did not stop his lorry. He drove away from the scene of the accident.

8       At about 12.35 pm, the Accused reached the multi-storey carpark at Block 737A, Woodlands Circle. He attempted to enter the carpark via the exit lane. He collided into the 2.1 metres high height limit pole, and the carpark metal arm barrier. He continued to try and effect entry in this manner several times. On each attempt he collided into the height limit pole and the metal arm barrier. Both these structures were dented as a result.

9       The Accused abandoned his lorry and fled on foot. He did not stop at the scene of the accident.

10     At about 1.01 pm, two police officers, Sgt Ser and Sgt Hou, arrived at the Accused’s residence at Blk 751 Woodlands Circle #XXX. The Accused was in the flat at the time. The two officers interviewed him and waited for Traffic Police officers to arrive. During the wait, the Accused began to act abnormally. He moved from room to room. He said he was hungry. He chewed on a raw egg. He took a sponge with detergent from the kitchen sink, left the tap water running, and went into his son’s room. Suspecting that he had consumed a controlled drug, the two officers decided to place him under arrest. They called for back-up.

11     The two officers followed the Accused into his room. They saw him chewing on his eye glasses. Worried that he might choked, they moved towards him to stop him. The Accused grabbed Sgt Hou’s lanyard and pulled it while grinning in a strange manner. A struggle took place and the lanyard broke.

12     At about 2.00 pm, the Accused started rolling around in his room, and kicking the window grills. He tried to go to the kitchen. The two officers stopped him from doing so, as they wanted to effect arrest. They were also concerned as there were knives in the kitchen. In response, the Accused gestured in a punching manner at Sgt Hou, and with his right arm forcefully pushed Sgt Hou on the chest once. He did this to deter Sgt Hou from effecting his arrest.

13     A scuffle then broke out. This was at about 2.10 pm. The three of them fell to the floor. The officers tried to handcuff the Accused but was not successful as the Accused was struggling violently. During the struggle, the Accused kicked Sgt Ser once on the face. This caused his eye glasses to fly off his face. Sgt Ser also felt pain from the kick.

14     The Accused was subsequently subdued and restrained, and he was placed under arrest.

15     At the Jurong Police Divisional Headquarters, the Accused’s blood specimen was taken from him and analysed by HSA. The analysis showed that the Accused’s blood specimen contained 0.1 micrograms of dextromethorphan per millimetre of blood. Dextromethorpan was used for the relief of unproductive cough due to bronchitis, cold and other respiratory tract disorders. It might cause side effects such as dizziness, light-headedness, drowsiness, nervousness, restlessness, nausea, vomiting and stomach pain.

16     The Accused claimed that he had consumed seven or eight “cough tablets” purchased from the Geylang area. He had felt drowsy, scared and lost after consuming the tablets. Despite this he had driven his lorry on 1 Aug 17. The dextromethorphan had led him to be incapable of having proper control of his lorry.

18     The Accused had been placed on 24 months’ drug supervision on 12 Jun 96. He was admitted into the Drug Rehabilitation Centre for six months on 4 Dec 97 which was then extended for a further nine months. On 1 Mar 99, he was placed on another 24 months’ drug supervision. And lastly, on 5 Dec 14, he was placed on yet another drug supervision for 24 months.

## PROSECUTION’S SENTENCING SUBMISSION

19     In relation the RTA offences, DPP Tan Hsiao Tien described the Accused as a very dangerous driver. On the basis of his egregious driving behaviour and the multiple offences committed, and his egregious driving antecedents, DPP Tan submitted that both general and specific deterrence must apply. DPP Tan categorised the Accused’s culpability as moderate to high.

20     For the s 67(1) RTA charge, DPP Tan sought a sentence of at least one month’s imprisonment and a four years’ disqualification order. She cited the case of _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 185</span> (“_Stansilas Fabian Kester_”). As for the other RTA charges, she sought for fines to be imposed and left the individual quantum to the court.

21     In respect of the s 332 charge, she submitted that the case fell into the band one category set out in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter_ \[2018\] 3 SLR 10 (“_Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_”). The police officer has suffered an injury. The Accused’s previous convictions for similar offences of violence should put him at the higher end of the sentencing band. Although the injury was minor but the act of kicking the police officer on the face was a particularly egregious one.

22     DPP Tan cited the case of _PP v Alfian bin Abdullah_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 111</span> (MA No 9053 of 2015/01) (“_Alfian bin Abdullah_”) to support the prosecution’s sentencing proposal. In that case, which was cited in _Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ at \[66\], the accused person had punched a police officer on the back of his head and kicked his stomach. On appeal, the High Court enhanced his sentence to 10 months’ imprisonment, taking into account the vengeful nature of the attack and the accused person’s long list of criminal antecedents.

23     As for the s 353 charge, DPP Tan submitted for a custodial sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment. A table of sentencing precedents was tendered which showed that the trend seemed to be in the range of four to six weeks’ imprisonment.

## MITIGATION PLEA

24     Mr Dilip Kumar tendered a written mitigation. At the outset, he laid out the Accused’s total remorse and regret for his actions. He emphasised the Accused’s full co-operation with the investigations. He was forthcoming and consistent in his police statements. He admitted to the offences without any reservation very early on. He ran his own transport business. His wife was a free lanced therapist. During the period of the offences, business was not as good as they hoped and this led to financial difficulties. They were unable to service the HDB mortgage payments which forced HDB to commence the process of re-possessing the flat. This was a significant source of worry for the Accused.

25     Mr Kumar submitted that the actions of the Accused in relation to the s 332 and s 353 Penal Code charges were the result of a momentary lapse of judgment. Mr Kumar highlighted that the Accused had a previous history of depression and anxiety. Although he had been treated for them, but being under extreme stress, he lost control of himself. This led to him lashing out at the police officers.

26     As for the RTA offences, and in particular the s 67(1) charge, Mr Kumar did not offer any reason why the Accused had consumed the drug before he drove his lorry. However, he asked that the disqualification order which was mandatory under s 67(1) be less than one year. This was because the Accused was reliant on his driving licence, and his business would be severely affected by an inordinately long disqualification period.

27     Lastly, Mr Kumar highlighted that the Accused had been crime free since his conviction in 2012. He had wanted to lead a normal and settled life. He secured gainful employment, gotten married and been a good husband, father and son-in-law. He submitted that the Accused still possessed redeemable qualities and therefore asked for lenient sentences.

## THE SENTENCE

#### The charge under s 332 Penal Code (DAC 926760/17)

28     In respect to the s 332 Penal Code charge, I agreed with the submission of DPP Tan that the case fell into category one of the sentencing band set out in _Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_. The indicative starting sentence under this sentencing band where hurt was caused ranged from two to nine months’ imprisonment. In this case, I was of the opinion that the appropriate sentence must fall on the higher end of the sentencing band. This was because the assault was particularly egregious ie kicking the face, which was a vulnerable part of the body. Also, from his antecedents, the Accused was not a stranger to acts of gratuitous violence. These factors, plus the sentence imposed in _Alfian bin Abdullah_ (at \[22\] above) suggested that the prosecution’s proposed sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the Accused was appropriate and fair given that there was only one act of assault. I therefore sentenced him to eight months’ imprisonment for this charge.

29     I rejected extreme stress as a mitigating factor in relation to this charge. I accepted that he was labouring under financial difficulties, and the potential adverse impact that it would have on him and his family. Although this would have caused him significant stress, but that could not be a mitigating factor that justified a downward shift in the sentence. As for the depression and anxiety that Mr Kumar pointed out as factors that had considerably heightened his stress level, there was no medical report to substantiate that he was suffering from these psychological conditions at the time of the offences, or that they had exacerbated his stress to the extent that he was unable to control himself. In the absence of supporting medical evidence, I rejected this contention.

#### The charge under s 353 Penal Code (DAC 907240/18)

30     In respect of this charge, the case precedents were clear. The sentences for pushing a police officer ranged from four to six weeks’ imprisonment. All considered I was of the opinion that a sentence on the lower end of the range was appropriate in this case. I therefore imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment on this charge.

#### The charge under s 67(1) RTA (DAC 916093/18)

31     For this charge, I would place the case as falling into the high culpability-moderate harm category. The Accused’s act of driving whilst under the influence of dextromethorphan had caused multiple accidents and consequently multiple property damage to private and public properties. There was also persistence in his conduct as he had not stopped after the first accident. Applying the sentencing guidelines in _Stansilas Fabian Kester_, the indicative sentence was up to two months’ imprisonment. In addition to the factors already set out at the beginning of this paragraph, I also took into account his traffic antecedents in determining what the appropriate sentence should be. As such, I imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment and four years’ disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence.

32     I rejected Mr Kumar’s submission for a disqualification period of less than one year. This was because there was a mandatory disqualification period of not less than one year under the section, unless there were special reasons not to order so. Mr Kumar candidly admitted that there were no special reasons in this case. His submission was purely on compassionate grounds.

#### The two charges under s 65(b) RTA and three charges under s 84(1)(a) RTA

33     For the two s 65(b) RTA charges (DAC 916094/18 & DAC 916096/18), I took into account the nature of damage caused to the two vehicles, and the Accused’s traffic antecedents. Although technically he was a first offender in respect of the offence under s 65(b), I was of the opinion that the maximum fine was appropriate to adequately address the dual considerations of general and specific deterrence. As such, I imposed a fine of $1000 in default five days’ imprisonment on each charge.

34     In sentencing the Accused on the three charges under s 84(1)(a) RTA, I took into account the same factors in \[32\]. In addition, I noted that the Accused had failed to stop not just once but three times. As such a high fine quantum was warranted. As such I imposed a fine of $800 in default four days’ imprisonment for each charge.

#### The total aggregate sentence

35     I ordered the imprisonment sentences in the s 332 Penal Code charge (DAC 926760/17) and the s 67(1) RTA charge (DAC 916093/18) to run consecutively, as they were distinct offences and were in relation to different legal interests. The total aggregate sentence was therefore nine months’ imprisonment and fine of $4400 in default 22 days’ imprisonment. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence for four years commencing from the date of his release from prison.

36     On a final note, the Accused sought for a deferment of sentence as he wished to settle his personal affairs. Despite the fact that this case has been on the system for one year and 10 months and 17 days, which was sufficient time for the Accused to have made all the necessary arrangements and readied himself to serve sentence, I approved his request but on the condition that he paid the fine amount of $4400 in full. He was unable to do so. As such, he commenced serving sentence on 19 Jun 19.

37     The Accused has lodged an appeal against the sentences.
