28 August 2019

### District Judge Seah Chi-Ling:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused, Tobin Lau Chee Bing (the “**Accused**”), a 46-year-old male Singaporean, pleaded guilty to 1 count of voluntarily causing hurt to his ex-girlfriend (the “**Victim**”) under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) without qualification, and was convicted and sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment. The Accused has filed an appeal against his sentence.

## THE CHARGE

3       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> You \[---\] are charged that on 29 May 2017, at or about 1.00 a.m., at 75 Poh Huat Road, #\[---\], Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Chia Li-ing Valerie, to wit, by punching her face several times with your fists and elbows and kicking her body at least once, causing her to sustain the following injuries:

>> a.    Severe swelling and bruising around the right eye, extending downwards and laterally to the right side of the cheek, as well as bruising on the nasal bridge;

>> b.    Blowout fracture of the right side of the orbital floor with contents of the right orbit herniating into the right maxillary sinus;

>> c.    Enophthalmos (posterior displacement) of the right eye and diplopia (double vision);

>> d.    Subluxation of the upper left central incisor; and

>> e.    Bruises on her left and right arms,

> with the intention to cause hurt to the said Chia Li-ing Valerie, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

4       The material portions of the SOF which the Accused admitted to without any qualification is as follows:

>   
| 

**_STATEMENT OF FACTS_**

_1\. The accused person is Tobin Lau Chee Bing, a 46-year-old male Singaporean, bearing NRIC No.: \[----\]._

_2\. The victim is Chia Li-ing Valerie, a 43-year-old female. The victim was working as a beauty consultant at the material time._

_3\. The victim and the accused were previously in a relationship and had jointly purchased the unit at 75 Poh Huat Road, #\[--\], Singapore (the “Unit”). The pair subsequently broke up._

**_First Information Report_**

_4\. On 29 May 2017, at 4.10am, the police received a text message from Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital stating “Hospital Message – Case of Unwitnessed Fall: Chia Li-ing Valerie, SXXX”._

**_Facts Relating to the Charge (DAC-921826-2018)_**

_5\. Investigations revealed that on 29 May 2017, at or about 1.00 a.m., the victim returned to the Unit. The accused was also in the Unit at the time. The accused and the victim got into a dispute._

_6\. The accused punched the victim several times in her face with his fists and elbows. The victim screamed for help, but the accused pinned the victim down and kicked the victim on her body at least once. The accused also continued punching the victim’s face. At this point in time, the victim was lying on the floor with her head facing up. The victim tried to block her face from the accused’s punches and continued screaming until the accused stopped. The accused punched and kicked the victim with the intention of causing hurt to the victim._

_7\. After the assault, the victim’s face was bleeding and swollen. There were bruises over various parts of her body. The victim sought medical treatment at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on the same day and was attended to by Dr. Goh Siak Shyong. A medical report dated 12 April 2018 and supplemental medical reports dated 16 May 2018 and 10 April 2019 were put up by Dr. Goh indicating that the victim suffered the following injuries:_

_a. Severe swelling and bruising around the right eye, extending downwards and laterally to the right side of the cheek, as well as bruising on the nasal bridge;_

_b. Blowout fracture of the right side of the orbital floor with contents of the right orbit herniating into the right maxillary sinus;_

_c. Enophthalmos (posterior displacement) of the right eye and diplopia (double vision);_

_d. Subluxation of the upper left central incisor; and_

_e. Bruises on her left and right arms._

_8\. Photographic documentation of the victim’s injuries is appended as Annex A._

_9\. The victim had to undergo an open reduction of the eye herniation and internal fixation of the right orbital floor fracture with titanium mesh under general anaesthesia as a result. While this adequately repaired the orbital fracture, Dr. Goh noted that the victim continued to present with mild diplopia and indicated that this would likely take another 2 to 3 months to recover._

_10\. Dr. Goh opined that the injuries to the victim’s face and limbs were mostly likely caused by large force blunt trauma._

_11\. A medical report prepared by Dr Chara Fan Hui Jinn dated 18 April 2019 also stated that the victim was seen in Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic on 22 February 2019. The victim had longstanding blurring of vision since her assault but it had not been worsening._

_12\. The victim was given 33 days of hospitalisation leave from 29 May 2017 to 30 June 2017._

_13\. By punching the victim’s face several times and kicking the victim’s body at least once, and causing the victim to suffer the injuries stated above, the accused has committed an offence of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## ANTECEDENTS

5       The Accused is traced, but his antecedents are not of a similar nature and are further very dated. His first offence was in 1985 when he was sentenced to 2 years’ probation for theft. In July 1991, he was sentenced to 18 months’ probation for theft of a motor vehicle or a component part thereof, driving a vehicle without a driving licence, and permitting the use of a motor vehicle without insurance coverage. Subsequently, in October 1991, he was placed under inhalant supervision for 12 months for using or inhaling an intoxicating substance. In 1999, he was fined $10,000 for unlicensed moneylending activities.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE

6       The prescribed punishment for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with a fine of up to $5,000, or with both.

7       In its written submission on sentencing, the Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of at least 3 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that the present case fell within the higher end of “Band 2” of the sentencing framework set out by the High Court in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 216</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”). The Prosecution highlighted, in particular, the severity of the injuries caused to the victim as detailed in paragraph 7 of the SOF (see paragraph 4 above). It was also pointed out that the Victim was given 33 days of hospitalisation leave due to her injuries, and had long-standing issues of blurring of vision after almost two years following the assault. It was further submitted that the Accused’s culpability was aggravated due to the prolonged nature of the attack, in which the Accused had continued to attack the Victim even after overpowering her and pinning the Victim down[^1].

## MITIGATION PLEA AND SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE BY DEFENCE

8       In a written plea-in-mitigation (the “**Mitigation Plea**”), counsel urged the court to sentence the Accused to a fine instead, arguing that there were very strong mitigating circumstances in the Accused’s favour.

9       It was not disputed that the Accused and the Victim had a nine-year relationship from 2007 to February 2016, although they were never married. During much of this time, they lived together in the flat where the assault took place (the “**Flat**”). The Flat was jointly purchased by the Accused and the Victim. Thus, the Victim retained a copy of the keys even after she moved out in February 2016.

10     The Defence submitted that throughout their nine-year relationship, the Victim had consistently taken the Accused for granted and abused his love for her. The Victim had allegedly made repeated requests and demands for money from the Accused to support her extravagant lifestyle, satisfy her shopping addiction, and pay off her gambling debts. It was alleged that the Victim had on various occasions stolen monies from the Accused’s wallet, drawers and/or safe, borrowed monies from his friends which the Accused had then repaid on her behalf, and applied for credit cards by using the Accused’s name and forging his signature and thereafter chalking up huge debts. However, due to his love for her, the Accused put up with the Victim and gave the Victim whatever she wanted.

11     Apart for taking advantage of the Accused financially, the Defence submitted that the Victim had also subjected the Accused to verbal tirades and physical abuse. She would for instance shout vulgarities from the window of the Flat and disturb the peace of the estate so as to embarrass and humiliate the Accused whenever her demands for money were not met. The only way the Accused could cause the Victim to desist from her tirade was to give in to her demands for money. This he did all the way up to 29 May 2017.

12     It was the Defence’s case that the straw that broke the camel’s back took place in the early hours of 29 May 2017 when the assault took place. Defence submitted that the Victim had on that night showed up at the Flat at 12.30 am in a tipsy state, and demanded $6,000 from the Accused to repay her debts. When the Accused refused to give her the money, the Victim started hurling vulgarities in an attempt to provoke the Accused to retaliate. She allegedly challenged the Accused to hit her. When the Accused tried to leave the property to de-escalate the situation, the Victim allegedly stopped him from leaving by grabbing his neck and T-shirt, causing him to grasp for air. According to the Defence, she also scratched his hands and face, threatened to kill the Accused, and challenged him to hit her. The Accused kept pushing her away, but she kept coming back to grab the Accused from behind. Defence avers that it was then that the Accused snapped and assaulted the Victim.

13     In the Mitigation Plea, Counsel argued that the Accused’s culpability was low in light of the following:

> (a)     The Accused was provoked by the Victim over an extended period of time throughout their nine-year relationship. The provocation culminated in the intense torment he received from the Victim on the night of the assault. Even then, the Accused only retaliated when the Victim prevented him from leaving the Flat and tried to suffocate him[^2];

> (b)     The altercation lasted for only a very short period of time;

> (c)     The Accused does not have a record of violence. The Accused’s act of hitting the Victim was done in the “heat of the moment”[^3]. Even the Victim’s mother had written a letter to the court pleading for leniency on the Accused’s behalf, stating that she had “always known \[the Accused\] to be a nice-natured person and has always treated \[the Victim\] very well and with respect …. \[and\] what \[the Victim\] did …. that night must have pushed \[the Accused\] to the limit”[^4].

> (d)     The Accused had suffered mentally throughout his relationship with the Victim. As the Victim continued to taunt and harass him even after they had broken up, the Accused was always on the edge, wondering and fearing when the Victim would turn up at the Flat unannounced. This had caused the Accused to be often depressed and to have suicidal thoughts[^5].

> (e)     The Accused provided medical assistance to the Victim immediately after the assault. He gave the Victim’s mother a sum of $6,300 as a deposit for the Victim’s admission to the hospital. He even made time to meet the Victim in person to hand her the insurance pay-out cheque which was sent to the Flat as he knew she needed the money.

> (f)     The Accused pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity thereby saving time and resources for the court and Prosecution.

## SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS

14     In _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”), the High Court laid down a two-step approach for sentencing offences under s 323 of the Penal Code, as follows:

> (a)     First, the court should identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused by the offence. This would allow the court to derive the appropriate indicative starting point.

> (b)     Next, the court should make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors.

15     Having regard to the orbital floor fracture sustained by the Victim which necessitated surgery under general anaesthesia for which the Victim was given 33 days’ hospitalisation leave, coupled with the mild diplopia (double vision) which presented itself even after close to two years after the assault, I am of the view that the present case fell within band 2 (“moderate harm”) of the _Low Song Chye_ sentencing framework. A case such as the present where moderate harm was caused attracts an indicative sentencing range of between 4 weeks to 6 months’ imprisonment.

16     The next task is to ascertain where the present case should be situated within the applicable indicative sentencing range, in light of the relative severity of the hurt sustained as compared to other forms of hurt that would fall within this band, as well as relevant sentencing precedents: see _Low Song Chye_ at \[88\].

17     The Prosecution referred me to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Tey Kok Peng_ (District Arrest Case No 912220 of 2014) (“_Tey Kok Peng_”) in which the victim similarly sustained an orbital fracture from an assault. Based on the statement of facts in _Tey Kok Peng_, a dispute broke out between the accused and a co-worker (the victim) and when the victim tried to push the accused away, the accused punched the victim’s left eye area. The co-accused then joined in the assault, pushing the victim from behind and causing the victim to fall to the ground. The accused persons thereafter punched and kicked the victim in his back and the back of his head after the victim had fallen on the ground. The victim sustained an orbital fracture of the eye, haemorrhage and bruises over the left eye, and left neck and chest tenderness. The accused, who had no similar antecedents, was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. In _Low Seng Chye_, See J held that _Tey Kok Peng’s_ case fell within the middle of band 2 of the sentencing framework \[at 92\].

18     I am of the view that the present case fell within the mid-upper range of Band 2, and should attract an indicative sentencing starting point of between 4 to 5 months’ imprisonment. The injury sustained by the Victim in the present case was much more severe than that in _Tey Kok Peng_. While the key injury sustained in both cases involved a fracture of the orbital floor, the orbital floor fracture and eye injuries in the present case were evidently more severe, as is apparent from the pictures of the Victim set out in the Annexures to the SOF. The orbital fracture in the present case was described as “a blowout fracture of the right side of the orbital floor, with the contents of the right orbit herniating into the right maxillary sinus”. Notably the orbital floor fracture in the present case was immediately diagnosed by the doctor who examined the Victim on the very morning of the assault[^6].

19     In contrast, in _Tey Kok Peng_, the orbital fracture sustained by the complainant there was not immediately apparent, and was not detected despite X-ray being taken when the complainant was first examined by the attending doctor at the hospital immediately after the assault. The complainant in _Tey Kok Peng_ was initially treated for subconjunctival haemorrhage over the left eye, bruises and abrasions only. When the complainant returned to the hospital for follow-up treatment two days later, again no definite orbital fracture was detected. It was only when the complainant was reviewed at the neurological department a few days thereafter and a CT scan was done that the accused was confirmed to have sustained a fracture of the left orbital floor. This suggested to me the orbital fracture and eye injury sustained in the present case were comparatively more severe than the orbital fracture and eye injury sustained in _Tey Kok Peng’s_ case.

20     I should also note that the Victim in the present case also sustained “enophthalmos (posterior displacement) of the right eye and diplopia (double vision)” as a result of the assault. In a medical report dated 18 April 2019, the attending physician stated that as at 22 February 2019, the Victim still had “longstanding blurring of vision since her assault, but it had not been worsening”[^7].

21     In _Low Song Chye_, See J opined that _Tey Kok Peng_ fell within the middle of Band 2. In view of the more severe injuries sustained in this case, I would therefore place the present case within the mid-upper range of band 2, with a starting indicative sentence of between 4 to 5 months.

22     I turn now to the second stage of the _Low Seng Chye_ analysis, which requires an analysis of how the indicative sentence should be adjusted taking into account the Accused’s culpability and all relevant aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

23     Starting with the aggravating factors. One aggravating factor in the present case is the prolonged and sustained nature of the attack. In the SOF admitted to by the Accused, he admitted to punching the Victim several times in her face, a vulnerable part of her body, with his fists and elbows[^8]. He also admitted to pinning the victim down and kicking her at least once, and then continuing to punch the victim’s face while the Victim was lying on the floor with her face facing upwards[^9]. The level of violence used by the Accused was also high. The herniation of the contents of the right orbit into the maxillary sinus was described in the medical report as being consistent with a “with a _large force applied to the eye_, with the _sudden pressure forcing the orbital contents downwards_, resulting in fracture of the thin orbital floor” _(emphasis added)_.[^10]

24     I noted, in this regard, the case of _Public Prosecutor v Cheng Tai Peng_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 121</span> and <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 104</span> (“_Cheng Tai Peng_”), which was observed in _Low Song Chye_ as a case in which a high level of violence was used in inflicting the injury. There, the accused assaulted the victim on board a MRT train when they fought over a vacant seat. The accused slapped the victim on the face over the left ear once with great force, and also hit the victim on the eye and nose. Even after, the victim moved to another part of the train, the accused again assaulted the victim by kicking and punching him. The injuries sustained by the victim was described as “a perforation of the left ear drum, a haematoma over the left cartilaginous portion of the victim’s left ear, some retinal bleeding and abrasions over the nose”. The accused, who claimed trial, was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment. In _Low Song Chye_, See J opined that he did not think that a 10-week imprisonment was adequate “in view of the hurt caused as well as the _level of violence used_” (_emphasis added_) (at \[93\]).

25     Turning now to the mitigating factors, Counsel emphasised the mental and emotional abuse the Accused received at the hands of the Victim during and after the end of their relationship. Counsel also placed significant emphasis on the provocation that the Victim subjected the Accused to on the night of the assault which caused the Accused to snap and hit the Victim. Counsel exhibited various out of court statements and letters from the Accused’s friends testifying to the Victim’s spendthrift habits, and her predisposition to borrowing from others to sustain her lavish lifestyle[^11]. There were also out of court statements and testimonies from the Accused’s friends and relatives, as well as the Victim’s own mother, which described how well the Accused treated the Victim throughout their relationship, and his kind and well-mannered personality generally[^12]. The Victim’s own mother commented that the Accused’s assault of the Victim was completely out of character, and that the Victim must have done something that has “pushed the Accused to the limit” that night.

26     Whilst I considered these testimonials and character references, I noted that these were all out-of-court testimonies, which were further made by individuals who were not at the scene on the night of assault. They therefore shed little light and carried little weight in so far as the _extent and nature_ of the alleged provocation the Accused was subjected to on the night of the assault were concerned. Details of how the events unfolded that night as painted by the Defence in the Mitigation Plea were in the final analysis largely based on the one-sided assertions of the Accused, which were not supported by direct eye-witnesses’ testimonies or any other form of direct evidence. Indeed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that the Accused suffered any injuries such as scratch marks or bruises, or any evidence that he was repeatedly choked by the Victim, to corroborate the Accused’s story in the Mitigation Plea (see paragraph 12 above). No medical evidence was also tendered as to the Accused’s mental state in support of the Defence’s contention that he suffered from anxiety and depression due to the Victim’s emotional abuse and unreasonable behaviour after their break-up (see paragraph 13(d) above). In my mind, these out of court testimonies as to the Victim and Accused’s general character, at best, only indicated that what the Accused did on the night of the incident was not premeditated, was a one-off aberration, and that he was not someone of a violent disposition ordinarily.

27     There were, however, a number of other valid mitigating factors in this case which I assigned weight to. First, I noted that the Accused had immediately after the assault sought medical assistance for the Victim by calling for an ambulance. Despite the Victim initially declining to board the ambulance and be sent to the hospital, when she eventually decided to seek medical treatment, the Accused promptly arranged for her to be sent to the hospital. It was also not disputed that the Accused had given the Victim’s mother $6,300 to pay for the hospital deposit, and subsequently paid more of the Victim’s hospital bills[^13]. The Accused also showed genuine remorse by apologizing to the Victim’s mother immediately after the assault. The accused’s assault of the Victim was likely to be an out-of-character, one-off incident. His early plea of guilt was also evidence of his true contrition and remorse, which had saved the court and the Prosecution significant time and resources.

## CONCLUSION

28     Despite the mitigating factors, I am of the view that the custodial threshold has clearly been crossed in the present case in light of the severity of the injuries inflicted, the sustained manner of the attack to a vulnerable part of the Victim’s body, and the level of violence used. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and after giving due consideration to all the aggravating and mitigating factors, I am of the view that an imprisonment term of 3 months would appropriately reflect the culpability of the Accused.

29     The Accused, being dissatisfied, has appealed against the sentence. He is presently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.
