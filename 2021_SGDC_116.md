\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9129/2021/01 and MA 9130/2021/01.\]

21 June 2021

### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal by both the Accused against the total sentence of 5 month’s imprisonment imposed on each of them.

2       The Accused were jointly tried before the Court. They decided to plead guilty after they had elected to give evidence in their defence but before the close of the case for the defence.

## The Charges

3       The Accused claimed trial to 6 charges. However, the Prosecution elected to proceed on 3 charges when the Accused decided to plead guilty. The other 3 charges were to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

4       Both the Accused had, in furtherance of their common intention, committed the offences and as they had pleaded guilty to similar charges, it will suffice that I set out only the charges against one of them, namely, the accused Sagor.

5       The 3 proceeded charges which the accused Sagor pleaded guilty were as follows:

## The Joint Statement of Fact (“SOF”)

6       Both the Accused admitted to the following SOF.

The First and Second Accused had travelled to the Dover Court Site in order to steal copper wire, which they intended to sell for their own profit. They intended to enter the Dover Court Site late at night in order to avoid detection by the parties who worked at the Dover Court Site.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4. In June 2019, DLM Pte Ltd (“<b>DLM</b>”) was a sub-contractor at the Dover Church Site.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5. Sometime between 11.45 pm on 10 June 2019 and 8.45 a.m. on 11 June 2019, the First Accused entered the Dover Court Site by climbing through a hole in the fencing (the “<b>Hole</b>”).

7       The Accused were found guilty and convicted of the 3 charges respectively.

## Charges Taken into Consideration (“TIC”)

8       Each of the Accused had 3 similar TIC. They admitted and consented to their respective 3 charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Antecedents

9       Both the Accused had no prior criminal records.

## Submission on Sentence

10     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 5 months' imprisonment against each of the accused persons. In particular, for charges MAC-908422-2019/MAC-908424-2019 (“Dover Court”), charges DAC-917934-2019/DAC-917933-2019 (“Dover Church”) and charges MAC-908421-2019/MAC-908423-2019 (“ARTRA”), the Prosecution submitted for 2 months' imprisonment, 2 months' imprisonment and 3 months' imprisonment respectively. The sentences in Dover Court and ARTRA were to run consecutively.

11     The Defence, on the other hand, submitted for a global sentence of 3 months' imprisonment for each of the accused persons

## Mitigation

12     Counsel highlighted orally that each of the accused persons benefited about $2,121.50.

13     The Accused did not have any prior criminal records. Counsel urged the court to treat the Accused as first-time offender as the offences were committed within a week.

14     It was also highlighted that the Accused had pleaded guilty halfway through the trial and thereby saved time. It was submitted that they were remorseful. The total value involved was more than $7,000 and that the cash of $1,050 seized will be forfeited.

15     Counsel conceded that there was planning in that the Accused knew where to steal.

16     Considering the sentencing precedents submitted by the Prosecution, counsel submitted that for the Dover Court and Dover Church charges, the sentence should be 1 month's imprisonment respectively. As for the ARTRA charge, the sentence submitted was for 2 months' imprisonment.

## Sentencing Considerations

17     Considering the nature of the offences and the circumstances leading to the commission of the offences, I was of the view that the main sentencing consideration must be one of general and specific deterrence.

18     I noted that the punishment for theft can be a jail term up to 3 years' imprisonment or a fine or both.

19     I gave credit to the Accused for pleading guilty although it was at a late stage. But as submitted by the Prosecution, it must not be accorded the full weight.

20     Next I noted that each of the accused persons benefitted about $2,121. This value was based on the proceeds that the Accused obtained from the sale of the stolen goods to the scrap metal buyers. But, to the owners, the loss would certainly be much higher. In this case, the total value involved was about $7,964.

21     As for the cash of $1,050 recovered, I noted that it was not a case of voluntary restitution but was seized from the accused person upon his arrest.

22     I agreed with the Prosecution that the SOF disclosed the Accused had embarked on a persistent course of offending at different construction sites between 10 June 2019 and 16 June 2019. Such offences would be more aggravated than a one-off offence. Hence, specific deterrence was warranted. See _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[18\].

23     With respect to counsel, I was of the view that there was premeditation and careful planning involved in the commission of the offences. It was not a case of merely knowing where to steal. The SOF stated that the Accused booked private hire vehicles to facilitate the commission of the offences. They also knew how and where to enter into the premises to steal. I also noted that the offences were committed during the late night. Clearly, they knew that was the best time to commit the offences undetected.

24     Having stolen the copper wires, the Accused brought it not to their dormitory but hid it in the vicinity of the dormitory. These were then retrieved on the following day for sale. This further supported my finding that there was careful planning and premeditation.

25     The Accused were construction workers. They specialized in stealing copper wires for sale to scrap metal buyers. Hence, they targeted specific construction sites which were likely to have copper wires in their premises.

26     Next, the Accused could not be considered as first-time offenders as they were serial offenders. The offences committed related to 3 separate incidents.

27     Another factor considered was that each of the Accused persons had admitted and consented to 3 charges to be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing.

## Sentencing Precedents

28     The Prosecution submitted a number of unreported sentencing precedents. Although these precedents were without written grounds of decision, it could still serve as a guide as to the range of sentences meted out in similar situations.

29     In _PP v Ruman Motiar Rahman_ (SC-902158-2014) ("**_Ruman_**"), the offender committed theft of bare earth cables of about 200m in length, with a total value of $2,600 from a worksite and sold it to a hardware shop. The offender pleaded guilty to 1 x section 379 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) ("**PC**") and consented for 1 x section 379 of PC to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The offender, who was untraced, was sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment.

30     In the case of _PP v Ahmad Bin Amin_ & _Nordin Bin Johari_ (SC-903169-2014 & SC-903170-2014) ("**_Amin_**" and "**_Nordin_**"), the offenders stole unattended copper cables worth a total of $10,000 at a worksite. The offenders, who were both untraced, pleaded guilty to 1 x section 379 of the PC r/w section 34 and was sentenced to 13 weeks' imprisonment respectively.

## Conclusion

31     Having considered the mitigation plea and the sentencing considerations stated above, I sentenced Mia Mohammad Imran and Sagor as follows:

32     I was of the view that the sentences meted out were in line with the precedents cited. I noted that unlike the sentencing precedents cited, in the present case, the Accused initially claimed trial. It was after witnesses were called but before the close of the case for the defence that the Accused decided to plead guilty. In this respect, there ought to be an uplift in sentences compared to the sentencing precedents cited.

33     The sentences in MAC-908421-2019/MAC-908423-2019 and MAC-908422-2019/MAC-908424-2019 were ordered to run consecutively. Hence, each of the Accused persons was given a global sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment. In my view, the sentence on the Accused was not crushing. Neither was it not in keeping with their future prospects.

34     The Accused are currently released on bail pending appeal.
