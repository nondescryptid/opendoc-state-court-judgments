\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9127/2019/01.\]

28 June 2019

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The defendant, a Singaporean currently 63 years of age, was arrested on 23 January 2018. A urine specimen was taken from him and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”) for analysis. Upon analysis the urine specimen was found to contain morphine, a specified drug under the _Misuse of Drugs Act_ (Cap 85, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”).

2       The defendant was charged with consuming the drug without authorisation. He claimed trial to the charge. After a brief trial he was, on 29 May 2019, found guilty and convicted on the charge. He was sentenced to 5 years and 2 months’ imprisonment, as well as an enhanced sentence of 143 days for breaching a condition of a remission order under which he was released for his previous drug offences. He filed the present appeal against his conviction and sentence on 31 May 2019. He is presently serving the sentence.

3       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charge

4       The charge against the defendant was as follows:

You \[...\] are charged that you, on or before 23 January 2018, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (“MDA”), to wit, morphine, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA \[...\].

#### Prosecution’s case

5       Much of the facts in the prosecution’s case was not disputed by the defendant.

#### (a)   Arrest and procurement of urine specimen

6       The defendant was arrested on 23 January 2018 at about 8.30 pm at Haig Road, during a random check conducted by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”). The defendant was screened and found to have failed to report for urine testing. (The arrest report was admitted in evidence as Exh P1.)

7       After his arrest the defendant was taken to the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters. A CNB officer, Sergeant Ahmad Badawi bin Abubakar Bagarib (PW2, “**Sgt Ahmad**”), escorted the defendant to procure his urine specimen. Sgt Ahmad testified[^1] that he instructed the defendant to select a “red bottle” from a container of more than 10 of such bottles, and two “blue bottles” from another container containing more than 20 of such bottles. The defendant was asked to open the packaging of all the three bottles. Sgt Ahmad then escorted the defendant to a toilet urinal. The defendant provided his urine sample into the red master bottle. Subsequently the urine specimen was handed to the IUT (Instant Urine Test) operator. At all times it was the defendant who carried the urine bottles.

8       The IUT operator was CNB officer Sergeant Nuruljanna Marican Binte Mohamed Rafee (PW3, “**Sgt Nuruljanna**”). She testified[^2] that she transferred some urine from the red master bottle into a test tube and performed an instant urine test. It tested positive for opiates. Sgt Nuruljanna then printed out the IUT Result Slip (Exh P2). She also printed out some labels bearing the defendant’s particulars. She took the two blue urine bottles from the defendant (which contained the defendant’s urine specimen) and sealed the bottles with a layer of masking tape. She fixed the labels, which had been signed by the defendant, on the two blue bottles. She then placed scotch tape over the urine labels. The defendant was asked to check that the particulars on the urine labels were correct. He was then asked to deposit the two blue bottles into a locked metal box.

#### (b)   Analysis of urine specimens by HSA

9       The defendant’s urine specimen was sent to the HSA on 24 January 2018. It was analysed separately by two analysts from the HSA (the “**HSA Analysts**”): Ms Ng Xue Qin (PW5, “**Ms Ng**”) and Ms Maggie Tiong Su Su (PW6, “**Ms Tiong**”). Upon analysis, the defendant’s urine was found to contain morphine. The certificates prepared by the HSA analysts under s 16 MDA were tendered in evidence (Exhs P3 and P4, respectively). Both HSA Analysts testified that the presence of morphine in the defendant’s urine specimen was consistent with the consumption of diamorphine (also known as heroin).[^3]

#### (c)   Presumption of consumption under s 22 MDA

10     Given that the defendant’s urine specimen was found by the HSA Analysts to contain morphine, a controlled drug, he was presumed under s 22 MDA to have consumed the drug, until the contrary is proved. Section 22 provides as follows:

Presumption relating to urine test

22.    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b) \[i.e., urine tests conducted by analysts of the HSA\], _he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug_ in contravention of section 8(b).

#### Defence

11     The defendant was called upon to enter his defence. He elected to testify.

12     In his defence, the defendant testified[^4] that since 2010 he had been taking a lot of medication because he suffered from a number of medical ailments, which included heart and kidney problems, asthma, high blood pressure. He had taken a variety of medicine during the period from 12 October 2017 to 22 January 2018. He had consumed 12-15 bottles of cough mixture and various types of tablets. He said that the mixture would mix with the metabolic system and produce this by-product of morphine. The metamorphosing of the active ingredients was a scientific fact that could only be confirmed by a medical expert or toxicologist. He maintained that he did not consume heroin.[^5] (The lists of medication tendered in evidence by the defendant were marked Exhs D1 and D2.)

#### Decision

13     On the evidence before me, I found that the defendant’s urine specimen had been properly procured and analysed by the HSA Analysts, and found to contain morphine. He was presumed under s 22 of the MDA to have consumed the drug until the contrary is proved.

14     The defendant provided no cogent evidence to prove the contrary. His evidence that the drug was found in his urine as he had consumed a lot of medication was no more than a bare assertion. It was refuted by the testimony of both HSA Analysts, who testified that the medication he consumed would _not_ give rise to morphine in the urine, regardless of the duration and the amount of the medication taken.[^6]

15     The defendant had not rebutted the statutory presumption that he had consumed the drug. Accordingly, he was found guilty and convicted on the charge.

## SENTENCE

#### Antecedents

16     The criminal record of the defendant revealed a number of prior convictions for various offences. His drug-related antecedents were as follows:

17     Additionally, the defendant had been admitted into the drug rehabilitation centre (DRC) on a number of occasions for consuming drugs:

#### Prescribed punishments

18     The defendant was liable for “LT-1” punishment, as prescribed under s 33A(1) of the MDA. This was on account of the defendant having been: (a) admitted into the DRC on 24 September 2013; and (b) having been convicted for an offence of consumption of a specified drug (morphine) on 15 December 2016. An LT-1 offence carries a minimum imprisonment term of 5 years’ imprisonment and a maximum of 7 years’ imprisonment. While the offence also carries a mandatory sentence of caning for a male offender, the defendant is no longer liable for caning as he is past 50 years of age.

19     In addition, the defendant was from 15 December 2017 to 14 June 2018 subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under the _Prisons Act_ (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed). The remission order was subject to a condition that the defendant did not reoffend while the remission order was in effect. In committing the present offence on 23 January 2018, the defendant had breached that condition. He was thus liable to be punished (under s 50T Prisons Act) with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order from 23 January 2018 to 14 June 2018, which was 143 days.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

20     In a brief oral submission, the prosecution submitted that as the defendant was not liable to caning in view of his age, a sentence above the mandatory minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment should be imposed. It was highlighted that the defendant was “heavily traced” for drug offences. It was also submitted that the entire 143 days of the enhanced sentence be imposed.

#### Mitigation plea

21     In a brief oral mitigation plea, the defendant urged the court to impose the minimum sentence and to backdate the sentence to the date of his remand. He said that he was suffering from a lot of illnesses.

#### Sentencing considerations

22     In deciding upon the sentence, I considered the primary sentencing objective to be that of _deterrence_. Additionally, where the offender has multiple drug offences and has displayed a propensity to reoffend, as in the present case, _prevention_ is also an important sentencing objective. These sentencing objectives are factored into the long mandatory imprisonment terms for LT-1 offences.

23     I agreed with the submission of the prosecution that a sentence above the mandatory minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate. The defendant had a long list of drug convictions and numerous admissions into the DRC. Apart from considerations of general deterrence, it was necessary that the defendant be _specifically_ deterred and prevented from reoffending. I took into account that the defendant was no longer liable for a sentence of caning which would ordinarily have been imposed on a male offender under the age of 50 years. The defendant had shown no remorse for his offence, and contested the charge despite having no credible defence. In my judgment, an uplift of about two months above the mandatory minimum imprisonment term would be appropriate, giving a sentence of 5 years and 2 months’ imprisonment.

24     I also considered it appropriate that an enhanced sentence of the entire period of 143 days be imposed on account of the defendant’s breach of the condition of his remission order. His previous conviction on 15 December 2016 was for drug-related offences, including drug consumption. He committed the present offence, which was of a similar nature, _during_ the period of his remission order. He ought no longer to receive the benefit of that remission. Hence an enhanced sentence of 143 days, which is the remaining duration of the remission order, should be imposed.

#### Sentence imposed

25     Accordingly, the following sentence was imposed:

26     The defendant is presently serving the sentence.
