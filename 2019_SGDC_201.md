\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9205/2019/01.\]

30 September 2019

### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The Accused, a 51-year-old male Singaporean, claimed trial to:

> (i)     a charge under section 8(_b_)(ii) punishable under section 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Revised Edition) (“the MDA”) for consumption of monoacetylmorphine, without authorisation (the “consumption charge”); and

> (ii)     a charge under section 8(_a_) punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA for possession of 0.09 gram of diamorphine, without authorisation (the “possession charge”).

Four other drug related charges were stood down. The Accused was in person.

2       I convicted the Accused on 2 August 2019 after a full trial. The Accused did not take a position in relation to the stood down charges. After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation presented by the Accused, I sentenced the Accused to 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the consumption charge, and 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the possession charge. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently from 8 April 2017.

3       The Accused is currently serving his sentence and has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. I now set out my reasons for my decision.

## (2)   The Prosecution’s Case

4       The Prosecution adduced evidence that the Accused was arrested on 6 September 2016 for suspicion of drug consumption and brought back to the Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”) together with, _inter alia_, a paper wrapper containing granular/powdery substance. At the PCC, the Accused complained that he was feeling unwell and was conveyed to the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”), where a “bladder catheterisation” was done “in view of urinary retention”. The Accused was then discharged and brought back to the PCC.

5       After the Accused was sent back to the PCC, his urine sample was procured by an officer from the Central Narcotics Bureau. Eventually the urine sample and paper wrapper were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. On analysis, the urine sample was found to contain monoacetylmorphine, and the granular/powdery substance was found to contain 0.09 gram of diamorphine.

6       I will set out the Prosecution’s case in six parts:

> (a)     the Accused’s arrest and the seizure of exhibits;

> (b)     the conveyance of the Accused to and the events at SGH;

> (c)     the chain of events at the PCC and custody of the exhibits;

> (d)     the HSA analysis;

> (e)     the catheter and urine bag; and

> (f)     the Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions.

### (a)   Accused’s arrest and seizure of exhibits

7       SI Seow Quak Keong Delson (“SI Delson”) (PW2) testified that on 6 September 2016 at about 4.00 am, while conducting mobile patrol with his partner SSI Mohamad Hisham bin Hashim (“SSI Hisham”) (PW13), he spotted the Accused cycling along North Bridge Road. As there was a series of thefts committed by a suspect riding on a bicycle, SI Delson decided to stop the Accused. He and his partner managed to stop the Accused at the junction of Coleman Street and North Bridge Road, at a location which was in front of the old Funan Mall[^1].

8       The Accused was told by SI Delson to dismount from his bicycle and the Accused complied. However, SSI Hisham noticed that the Accused’s left hand was in the left pocket of his pants[^2] and alerted SI Delson accordingly. SI Delson further observed that the Accused was in a daze[^3] and SSI Hisham also observed that the Accused was slurred in his speech and was unsteady in gait[^4]. They then decided to place the Accused under arrest for suspicion of drug consumption[^5]. Both SI Delson and SSI Hisham grabbed hold of the Accused’s hands and handcuffed them. As they did so, they saw that the Accused’s left hand was clenched in a fist[^6], after it was removed from his pocket.

9       Both SI Delson and SSI Hisham ordered the Accused to unclench his fist. After telling the Accused to do so several times, the Accused finally unclenched his left fist, after giving his left fist a squeeze[^7]. As the Accused unclenched his fist, SI Delson and SSI Hisham saw pieces of aluminium falling onto the road. SI Delson also saw a brown granular substance falling from the Accused’s hand. Upon seeing this, SI Delson put on gloves and retrieved the items, which had fallen from the Accused’s left hand: (i) a paper wrapper with a brown granular/powdery substance, (ii) three pieces of aluminium foil, and (iii) a small, torn Ziplock bag[^8] (“the Exhibits”). SI Delson also used two cards to scoop up the powdery substance which fell from the Accused’s hands[^9]. All the exhibits were then placed on a piece of A4-sized paper[^10].

10     After arresting the Accused, SSI Hisham lodged a First Information Report (P16) at about 4.23 am with the Operations Room. Thereafter, the Accused was brought to the PCC by Sgt/2 Chan Yui Gui Peter (“Sgt/2 Peter”) (PW15) and his partner. The Exhibits were held by SSI Hisham who was travelling in another police car with SI Delson[^11]. Upon reaching the PCC, SSI Hisham handed the Exhibits over to SI Delson[^12]. SI Delson then lodged an Arrest Report (P4) and transferred the Exhibits from the A4-sized paper to a polymer bag before handing over the Arrest Report and the Exhibits to the officer, SSSgt Syed Faizal bin S Alwi (“SSSgt Syed Faizal”) (PW18), at the Charge Office for safe-keeping[^13]. SSSgt Syed Faizal confirmed that he received the Exhibits from SI Delson, and that he locked the Exhibits in the safe at about 5.20 am after checking the Exhibits against what was written in the Safe Register Book (P8)[^14]. The Safe Register Book[^15] documented the details of the Exhibits.

11     The Accused was handed over to the lock-up officers at the PCC by Sgt/2 Peter upon arrival[^16]. However, the Accused claimed that he was a cancer patient, and a decision was made to send the Accused to the SGH for a medical examination to determine if the Accused was fit for detention[^17].

### (b)   Conveyance of the Accused to and events at SGH

12     The Accused was conveyed to SGH, escorted by Sgt/2 Oh Hao Ren (PW16) and his partner. Upon arrival at SGH, the Accused was registered at the Department of Emergency Medicine at about 6.45 am and examined by Dr Vetrivel Ramar (“Dr Vetrivel”) (PW1) at about 8.30 am.

13     Dr Vetrivel testified that the Accused was brought in by the police to determine his “fitness for detention”[^18]. The Accused complained of discomfort over the suprapubic region and told Dr Vetrivel that he was unable to pass urine[^19]. The Accused also told Dr Vetrivel that he “previously had some prostate problems”[^20]. An ultrasound was done on the Accused, which showed the presence of urine in his bladder[^21].

14     As Dr Vetrivel noted that the Accused was in discomfort, a decision was made to proceed with urinary catheterisation to relieve the Accused of his discomfort[^22]. Dr Vetrivel then put on sterile gloves and performed the procedure by inserting a sterile urinary catheter to drain the urine[^23]. Once Dr Vetrivel ascertained that the urine was draining from the bladder, he attached a sterile urine bag to the catheter[^24]. Dr Vetrivel confirmed that there was no possibility of the catheter or urine bag being contaminated with monoacetylmorphine as all the necessary precautions were taken to ensure that there was no contamination, and the chemicals which were used before or during the catheterisation procedure would not cause the presence of monoacetylmorphine in the Accused’s urine sample[^25]. He further testified that he had explained to the Accused the procedure of urinary catheterisation and the Accused was conscious and alert when the catheter was inserted[^26].

15     Dr Vetrivel further testified that the Accused’s acute retention of urine could be due to various “medical conditions”[^27]. However, the Accused did not present with any of these medical conditions when he examined the Accused, and it was possible that the Accused was deliberately refusing to pass urine[^28].

16     The Accused was escorted back to the PCC by Sgt Muhammad Khairul Azhar bin Selamat (PW17) and his partner after his discharge from SGH the same day[^29], and handed over to the lock-up officers.

### (c)   Chain of events at PCC and custody of exhibits

(i)     _The urine sample_

17     The Accused was brought to the CNB Enforcement A Office (“CNB Office”) upon his return from SGH. He was approached by SSgt Amir bin Mohamed Noor (“SSgt Amir”) (PW23) who was tasked to procure the Accused’s urine sample[^30]. SSgt Amir saw that the Accused was in a wheelchair with a catheter attached to him. He assessed the Accused’s condition and informed the Accused that he would be procuring the Accused’s urine. SSgt Amir then instructed the Accused to choose a master bottle and two small bottles in the CNB Office which SSgt Amir had taken from the Waiting Room[^31] to the Accused. The Accused then picked a master bottle and two small bottles accordingly from a selection of more than 20 master bottles and 20 small bottles. All three bottles were sealed in individual packs[^32].

18     After the bottles were chosen, SSgt Amir proceeded to drain a sufficient amount of urine from the Accused’s urine bag, in the presence of the Accused[^33]. SSgt Amir was familiar with the process as he received his training in Health Sciences Nursing and had worked as a nurse at the National University Hospital[^34]. From the master bottle, SSgt Amir apportioned the urine sample into the two small bottles and sealed them with masking tape in the presence of the Accused[^35]. The two small bottles were then placed inside a Ziplock bag and “sealed with barcode”[^36]. As for the master bottle, it was discarded after SSgt Muhammad Faizal bin A Razak (“SSgt Muhd Faizal”) (PW21) siphoned off an amount of urine for the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”)[^37].

19     SSgt Amir then placed the Ziplock bag with the two small bottles on the Accused’s lap and waited with him for the IUT result[^38]. Eventually, SSgt Muhd Faizal returned with the IUT result (P19) and SSgt Amir saw that the IUT result was positive for opiates and benzodiazepines. Sgt/2 H Mohamed Assad (“Sgt/2 Assad”) (PW24) then proceeded to seal the two small bottles which were on the Accused’s lap. Sgt/2 Assad removed the two small bottles from the Ziplock bag. After ascertaining that they were not leaking, Sgt/2 Assad passed two Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) labels to the Accused and instructed him to confirm that his name and NRIC number were correct. The Accused confirmed and signed on both labels. The labels were then affixed onto the two small bottles and deposited into the HSA metal box. Sgt/2 Assad then placed the metal box in the refrigerator before locking it. The key to the HSA metal box reposed in the HSA[^39].

20     SSgt Gan Cher Kiat (“SSgt Gan”) (PW7) testified that, on 7 September 2016[^40], he retrieved the HSA metal box containing the Accused’s urine samples from the “chiller” and brought the metal box to the HSA. Upon arrival, at about 10.34 am, SSgt Gan submitted the HSA metal box to an officer who opened the metal box in his presence using a key which was held only by the HSA[^41]. After the metal box was opened, SSgt Gan verified that the two small sealed bottles containing the Accused’s urine sample were in the metal box[^42].

#### (ii)   The Exhibits

21     It was the evidence of SSSgt Syed Faizal that before his shift ended at 8.00 am on 6 September 2016, he handed over the Exhibits to SI Toon Chee Yong (“SI Toon”) (PW19). SI Toon was deployed to perform the role of a “Person in Custody Supervisory Officer” from 8.00 am on that day. He confirmed that he took over the Exhibits which were in the safe in the Charge Office from SSSgt Syed Faizal. SSSgt Syed Faizal handed over a “checklist” to him and SI Toon then checked that the Exhibits tallied with the items listed in the Safe Register Book (P8)[^43].

22     On the same day, at about 2.35 pm, SSI Leow Poh Eng (“SSI Leow”) (PW20) from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) withdrew the Exhibits from the safe in the Charge Office. The Exhibits were in a sealed polymer bag and SSI Leow checked that there was no tampering before handing it over to SSgt Muhd Faizal[^44].

23     After taking over the Exhibits from SSI Leow, SSgt Muhd Faizal cut opened the polymer bag and separated the drug exhibits from the non-drug exhibits. He then placed the Exhibits into two separate CNB polymer bags[^45] before handing them to W/SSgt Filzah Zulzilah binte Ismail (“W/SSgt Filzah”) (PW22). After collecting the two CNB polymer bags from SSgt Muhd Faizal, W/SSgt Filzah proceecded to “open and create IP” before handing the Exhibits back to SSgt Muhd Faizal at about 4.30 pm, for the purpose of “statement-taking”[^46].

24     At about 5.40 pm on 6 September 2016, SSgt Muhd Faizal returned the two polymer bags to W/SSgt Filzah. W/SSgt Filzah then deposited the two polymer bags into her metal cabinet and locked it[^47]. The two polymer bags were kept in her metal cabinet until 7 September 2016, when she handed them over to SSgt Amir, who was the initial Investigating Officer. Thereafter, SSgt Amir put on gloves, removed the Exhibits from the polymer bags and took photographs of the Exhibits (P7:1-2). When he had completed taking photographs of the Exhibits, SSgt Amir sealed the paper wrapper with the brown granular/powery substance in an exhibit bag for W/SSgt Filzah to send to the HSA for analysis. As for the remaining Exhibits, _ie_., the three pieces of aluminium foil and the torn Ziplock bag, they were sealed in another exhibit bag and kept in the “CNB store”[^48].

25     It is the evidence of W/SSgt Filzah that she received the paper wrapper with the brown granular/powdery substance from SSgt Amir on 8 September 2016. On the same day, she sent the paper wrapper with the brown granular/powdery substance, which was sealed in a tamper-proof bag, to the HSA for analysis and the HSA confirmed receipt of the same at 4.51 pm[^49].

#### (iii)   The DNA specimen

26     Ms Jeanne Loh Si Ying (“Ms Loh”) (PW10) testified that she was tasked to obtain the Accused’s blood specimen on 6 September 2016. Ms Loh was an officer with the Forensic Operations Response Team at that time. Before proceeding to obtain the Accused’s blood specimen, the consent of the Accused was obtained at about 4.43 pm with the assistance of W/SSgt Filzah, who interpreted the consent form (P14) to the Accused.

27     After the Accused gave his consent, Ms Loh laid out “five collection kit\[s\] in front of the Accused”. The Accused was asked to pick a kit for the collection of his blood specimen and Ms Loh then proceeded to obtain the Accused’s blood specimen using the Flinders Technology Associate card (with the barcode number S142575) at about 4.40 pm. Thereafter, the card was placed in an envelope and sealed with a government seal. The Accused was asked to sign across the government seal and to drop the envelope into a metal collection box[^50]. Ms Loh then brought the metal box together with the “Suspect/Witness Body Sample Collection Form” (P15) to the “CRO”[^51].

28     On 7 September 2016, Mr Poh Beng Kiong (PW6) collected the Accused’s blood specimen and submitted it to the HSA at about 11.00 am[^52].

### (d)   The HSA analysis

29     The Accused’s urine samples were analysed by Mr Ng Chee Ann (PW 3) and Mr Chang Hian Twan (PW4). Mr Ng and Mr Chang were analysts with the Analytical Toxicology Division of the Applied Sciences Group of the HSA at the relevant time. Both of them testified that the Accused’s urine sample, on analysis, contained monoacetylmorphine[^53].

30     As for the paper wrapper with the granular/powdery substance, Dr Zhang Shuhua (“Dr Zhang”) (PW5) analysed the granular powdery substance and found it to contain not less than 0.09 gram of diamorphine[^54]. Dr Zhang also gave evidence that after pouring out the contents from the paper wrapper, the paper wrapper was placed in a “HSA bag” and transferred to the “DNA Profiling Laboratory” for analysis[^55]. Dr Zhang was an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory, Illicit Drugs Division of the Applied Sciences Group of the HSA at the material time.

31     Ms Joyce Low (“Ms Low”) (PW8), an analyst with the DNA Database Laboratory, Biology Division of the Applied Sciences Group of the HSA, gave evidence that she analysed a blood specimen with the barcode number S142575 and obtained the DNA profile of the specimen. She subsequently prepared a report dated 30 September 2016 (P12) reflecting the result of the analysis, and extended a copy of the report to her colleague, Ms Annabel Tay (“Ms Tay”) (PW9), to conduct DNA matching[^56].

32     Ms Tay confirmed that she received an exhibit (a piece of paper) from the Illicit Drugs Laboratory on 16 September 2016. She swabbed the piece of paper and managed to identify two DNA components from the swab. The result of the analysis was reflected on page 3 of Ms Tay’s report dated 21 October 2016 (P13) – a major component which were the “bracketed components”, and an “uninterpretable component”[^57]. After obtaining the DNA profile from the piece of paper, Ms Tay compared the result with the DNA profile of the blood specimen with the barcode number S142575. Ms Tay was “very certain that S142575 \[could\] be included as the major contributor of the profile obtained”[^58].

### (e)   The catheter and urine bag

33     The Prosecution adduced evidence from Mr Melvin Tay Chong Guan (“Mr Tay”) (PW4), who was a Business Director for South East Asia of Becton Dickenson and Bard. The company was the manufacturer of the catheter which was used by Dr Vetrivel on the Accused. Mr Tay testified that all the catheters which were supplied to SGH at the material time were individually wrapped in a sterile pack, and that there was no possibility of any of the catheters being contaminated with diamorphine, morphine or monoacetylmorphine[^59].

34     In relation to the urine bag, the prosecution adduced evidence from Mr Tay Lin Hwee (“Mr Tay LH”) (PW3). Mr Tay LH was the Director of Product Development of Ras Pharma and Biochem Pte Ltd which supplied the urine bag which Dr Vetrivel used on the Accused. Mr Tay LH testified that all the urine bags supplied by his company were sealed and sent for sterilisation before being supplied to SGH at the material time. The was no possibility of any of the sealed urine bags being contaminated with diamorphine, morphine or monoacetylmorphine[^60].

### (f)   The Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions

35     According to the Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions (P22), the Accused was convicted in June 2012 for an offence of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. He was also convicted of an offence of drug consumption (enhanced) and sentenced to 5 years and 8 months’ imprisonment, and 3 strokes of the cane.

## (3)   Close of Prosecution’s case

36     It was clear from the Prosecution’s evidence that the Accused’s urine specimen was found to contain monoacetylmorphine, and the paper wrapper seized from the Accused when he dropped it onto the road held granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.09 gram of dimorphine. I therefore found that the Prosecution had made out a case against the Accused by satisfying the requirements of section 230(1)(_j_) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68) and called on him to enter his defence for both the charges.

## (4)   The Defence

### (a)   Evidence of the Accused

37     The Accused chose to give evidence in his defence. He claimed that on 6 September 2016, at about 1.30 am, he decided to cycle from his home at Jalan Kayu to SGH as he was experiencing pain in his prostate. When he arrived at the junction of North Bridge Road and Coleman street, he was stopped by a police car. SI Delson and SSI Hisham then emerged from the police car and asked him where he was going to. Upon hearing that he was going to SGH, SI Delson instructed the Accused to put his hands on the bonnet of the police car. SI Delson then reached into his right pocket and retrieved a Ziplock bag with two pieces of paper inside. The Accused was then handcuffed and brought back to the station[^61].

38     At the station, the Accused claimed that he was put in a lock-up and was told that if he did not provide his urine sample within 6 hours, he would be further charged for refusing to give his urine sample[^62]. The Accused then informed the officer that he was unable to urinate and had to go to the hospital as he had a “medical condition” regarding his prostate[^63].

39     The Accused further claimed that he was eventually sent to SGH at about 6.00 am. He alleged that the doctor did not check his prostate despite his telling the doctor of his medical record at the Changi General Hospital[^64]. The doctor inserted a catheter into him to drain his urine into a urine bag. He was still in pain when he was discharged and was not aware how the CNB subsequently procured his urine. However, he knew that the CNB did not follow the procedure in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 6, 1999 Rev Ed) (the “MDR”)[^65]. During cross-examination, he denied choosing the master bottle and the smaller bottles[^66], and alleged that the signature on the HSA labels was not his signature and alluded that it was forged by Sgt/2 Assad[^67]. He also claimed that the two small bottles were not returned to him pending the result of the IUT.

40     As for the Exhibits, the Accused alleged that they were not shown to him at the PCC[^68] and were not sent to HSA for analysis[^69].

### (b)   The Accused’s statement

41     In the course of cross-examination, the Prosecution sought to confront the Accused with a statement which the Accused had given to SSgt Muhd Faizal on 6 September 2016 at 4.35 pm (P26). The Accused was unclear on whether or not P26 was given voluntarily. As the Accused was in person, an ancillary hearing was held to ascertain the voluntariness and admissibility of P26. I admitted P26 at the conclusion of the ancillary hearing. The Prosecution sought to rely on paragraph 5 of P26 which stated that the Exhibits were shown to the Accused at the time of the recording of P26.

## (5)   Closing Submissions

### (a)   The Prosecution’s submissions

42     In relation to the possession charge, the Prosecution submitted, _inter alia_, that the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses showed that the Accused was holding onto the paper wrapper when he was first checked by SI Delson. The evidence of SI Delson and SSI Hisham in relation to the arrest of the Accused and the seizure of the paper wrapper was consistent and clear. The paper wrapper and its contents were sent to the HSA for analysis. The contents were found to be 0.09 gm of diamorphine, and the DNA found on the paper wrapper matched the Accused’s DNA.

43     As for the consumption charge, the Prosecution submitted that there was no contamination in the urine sample of the Accused, which was obtained from a urine bag, with the Accused’s consent. The urine bag was attached to the catheter which was inserted into the Accused by Dr Vetrivel. The urine sample was poured from a master bottle to two small bottles. The small bottles were properly sealed and thereafter sent to HSA for analysis and found to contain monoacetyldiamorphine. There was no break in the chain of custody of the urine sample, and no evidence that the urine sample had been tampered with prior to the urine specimen being sent to HSA for analysis.

### (b)   The Defence’s submissions

44     The Accused submitted that his urine sample was not procured in accordance with the First Schedule to the Regulations, specifically, that he was not directed to wash his hands before providing his urine sample[^70] and that he did not urinate into the master bottle[^71]. The Accused claimed that he did not consent to the procurement of his urine sample from the urine bag, and that he did not choose the bottles which was subsequently used to contain his urine sample[^72]. The Accused further submitted that he did not sign the HSA labels and that the two small bottles were not returned to him.

45     In addition, the Accused submitted that he had prostate issues which caused acute urine retention. As a result of his medical condition, his urine supervision order was suspended[^73].

46     With respect to the possession charge, the Accused submitted that the evidence of SI Delson and SSI Hisham were inconsistent. He denied touching the paper wrapper and its contents and submitted that he did not know why his DNA was found on the paper wrapper since he did not touch it[^74].

47     The Accused further submitted that he had been framed by the Prosecution witnesses[^75], including Dr Vetrivel, who conspired with the Prosecution[^76]. The Prosecution had also “changed the evidence” in its submission[^77].

## (6)   My decision

### (a)   Joinder of charges

48     The Accused was charged for having not less than 0.09 gram of diamorphine in his possession, without authorisation, on 6 September 2016 at about 4.05 am. Following his arrest, the Accused’s urine sample was obtained on the same day and sent for urine analysis at the HSA. The analysis showed the presence of monoacetylmorphine in his urine sample and the Accused was thus charged with consumption of monoacetylmorphine, without authorisation.

49     Section 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012) (“the CPC”) states:

> **Trial for more than one offence**

> 134\. If, in one series of acts connected so as to form the same transaction, 2 or more offences are committed by the same person, then he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence.

50     I was satisfied the possession charge and the consumption charge were so connected that they formed the same transaction, and the Accused could be tried for both offences at one trial.

### (b)   The possession charge

51     Having dealt with the preliminary point of joinder of the charges, I next considered whether the Prosecution had proved its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I shall first deal with the possession charge as that charge does not present any complex issue of law.

#### (i)   The Prosecution witnesses were credible

52     The Accused alleged that he was framed by the Prosecution witnesses. Having heard the testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses and observed their demeanor in court, I found the Accused’s allegations to be spurious and totally unsupported by any independent or objective evidence. There was no conceivable reason why the officers who belonged to different enforcement agencies would conspire to frame the Accused.

53     There was also no basis to suggest that Dr Vetrivel had conspired with the Prosecution against him. This was never raised by the Accused during the trial and was not put to Dr Vetrivel when he was on the stand.

54     While the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 would apply to the Accused in the present case, I accorded some latitude to the Accused as he was in person and did not hold him strictly to the rule in _Browne v Dunn_. However, the fact that the Accused had the tendency to shift his position and hurl more allegations against the Prosecution and its witnesses, as the trial progressed, could not be ignored.

55     I therefore also rejected the Accused’s claim that Dr Vetrivel had conspired with the Prosecution against him. The allegation was totally without merit.

56     I accepted the evidence of SI Delson and SSI Hisham that the Accused was seen with his left hand in this pocket when he was first stopped by them. When they made the decision to arrest the Accused for suspicion of drug consumption and grabbed hold of his hands, they saw that the Accused’s left hand was clenched in a fist after he removed it from his pocket. They ordered the Accused to unclench his fist, and as the Accused did so after squeezing his fist, the following items fell from the Accused’s left hand onto the road:

> (i)     a paper wrapper with brown granular/powdery substance,

> (ii)     three pieces of aluminium foil, and

> (iii)     a small, torn Ziplock bag[^78].

57     These items were seized by SI Delson and it was observed that the paper wrapper contained a brown granular/powdery substance. The paper wrapper with the brown granular/powdery substance was eventually sent to the HSA for analysis. The brown granular/powdery substance was found to contain 0.09 gram of diamorphine, and the Accused’s DNA was also found on the paper wrapper. I was satisfied that the HSA analysis of the drug and the DNA profiling were properly done, and that there was no break in the chain of custody of the paper wrapper containing the diamorphine. The movements of the Exhibits, which included the paper with the brown granular/powdery substance, were properly documented[^79] and accounted for by the enforcement officers[^80].

#### (ii)   The Accused knew the nature of the drug

58     As the drug was found in the Accused’s possession, the Accused was presumed under section 18(2) of the MDA to know the nature of the drug. Other than claiming that he did not recognise the paper wrapper, and that the photographs of the paper wrapper were not taken in his presence, the Accused did not produce any evidence to rebut the presumption.

59     In any event, even without relying on the presumption, I found that there was sufficient evidence from the testimony of the arresting officers and the Accused’s behaviour at the time of arrest to infer that the Accused knew that the brown granular/powdery substance, which was seen dropping from his left hand onto the road, was an illicit drug:

> (i)     he was seen behaving suspiciously, with his left hand in his pocket, when he was stopped by SI Delson and SSI Hisham;

> (ii)     he kept his left hand in his pocket and SI Delson and SSI Hisahm had to grab his hands and remove his left hand from his pocket when they handcuffed him;

> (iii)     even after his left hand was removed from his pocket, the Accused kept his left hand clenched in a fist;

> (iv)     the Accused released his clenched fist only after being told to do so repeatedly;

> (v)     instead of just releasing his fist naturally, the Accused gave it a squeeze before doing so;

> (vi)     the Accused did not give any explanation on his furtive and suspicious behaviour, and instead tried to disassociate himself with the paper wrapper containing the drug by denying that the paper wrapper was on him; and

> (vii)     the Accused repeatedly denied being shown the paper wrapper and its contents after he was brought back to the PCC, which was contradicted by P26. P26 was admitted after an ancillary hearing was held. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, I was satisfied that P26 was properly recorded and voluntarily given. As indicated in \[51\] – \[57\] above, I found the Prosecution witnesses to be credible, and their evidence, reliable. I further found that SSgt Muhd Faizal had accurately reflected in P26 what was told to him by the Accused and that SSgt Muhd Faizal had shown the Exhibits, which included the paper wrapper containing the brown granular/powdery substance, to the Accused.

### (c)   The consumption charge

60     As the Accused claimed that he was unable to pass urine and was in discomfort, Dr Vetrivel made a decision to perform a urinary catheterisation to drain the urine from the Accused’s bladder. The Accused’s urine sample was therefore procured from the urine bag and not from the conventional way of a suspect urinating into a master bottle, as envisaged in \[4(1)\] of the First Schedule to the MDR.

61     The Accused raised the argument that since the CNB officers had breached various provisions in the First Schedule to the MDR, his urine sample was therefore not properly procured and he should be acquitted of the consumption charge.

62     The Accused’s argument raised an issue of law, and I shall deal with the issue in detail.

#### (i)   The relevant legislative provisions

63     Under section 22 of the MDA, a person is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed a controlled drug in contravention of section 8(_b_) of the MDA, if that controlled drug is found in the urine of that person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(_b_).

64     Section 31 of the MDA states:

> **Urine tests**

> 31.—(1)    Any officer of the Bureau, immigration officer or police officer not below the rank of sergeant may, if he reasonably suspects any person to have committed an offence under section 8(_b_), require that person to provide a specimen of his urine for urine tests to be conducted under this section.

> …

> (2)    A person, who fails, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of his urine within such time as may be required by any officers referred to in subsection (1), … shall be guilty of an offence.

> …

> (4)    A specimen of urine provided under this section shall be divided into 3 parts and dealt with, in such manner and in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed, as follows:

>> …

>> (_b_)    each of the remaining 2 parts of the urine specimen shall be marked and sealed and a urine test shall be conducted on each part by a different person, being either an analyst employed by the Health Sciences Authority or any person as the Minister may, by notification in the _Gazette_, appoint for such purpose.

65     The Accused argued that the consumption charge could not be made out as the enforcement officers, in procuring his urine sample, failed to comply with the following paragraphs in the First Schedule to the MDR:

PROCUREMENT OF URINE SPECIMEN

> 1.    A suspect who is required to provide a specimen of his urine shall be directed by an enforcement officer to wash and dry his hands.

> 2.    The suspect shall be asked by an enforcement officer to choose, in the presence of the enforcement officer, a master bottle that is pre-packed and sealed from a lot of not less than 10 bottles provided by the enforcement officer and 2 containers that are pre-packed and sealed from a lot of not less than 20 containers provided by the enforcement officer.

> 3.—(1)    The suspect shall then carry with him the master bottle and the 2 containers of his choice and be escorted by the enforcement officer (or some other officer authorised by the enforcement officer) to an appropriate place to provide his urine specimen.

> …

> 4.—(1)    The suspect shall urinate into the master bottle.

> (2)    The officer escorting the suspect shall ensure that the urine specimen in the master bottle is that of the suspect and not that of any other person.

> **Where urine specimen in master bottle is 80 ml or more**

> 5.—(1)    Where the volume of the suspect’s urine specimen in the master bottle is 80 ml or more, 30 ml or more of the urine specimen shall be transferred by the suspect or an enforcement officer, with both present, from the master bottle into each of 2 containers.

> …

> (3)    While waiting for the screening test result, the 2 containers may be temporarily sealed by an enforcement officer and returned to the suspect.

> …

> **Sealing of containers for analysis by Health Sciences Authority**

> 13.    An enforcement officer must observe the following procedures when sealing the 2 containers for the purpose of analysis by the Health Sciences Authority:

>> …

>> (c)    the suspect shall be allowed to check and sign the labels in the presence of the officer. If the suspect is unable to read, the officer shall read the particulars on the labels to the suspect. The officer shall then affix the labels to seal the containers;

>> (d)    the officer shall ask the suspect himself to deposit one container of the urine specimen into each of the 2 security boxes which shall be kept locked at all times until the boxes are delivered to the Health Sciences Authority.

#### (ii)   The procurement of the urine sample

66     The process by which the Accused’s urine sample was procured was set out clearly in the evidence of SSgt Amir. I disbelieved the Accused’s assertion that he was in pain and did not know or consent to the procurement of his urine sample from the urine bag. While the Accused claimed that he was in so much pain that he was not aware that his urine sample was being taken by the officers, he accused the officers of not “follow\[ing\] procedures” (for example, by sending a Corporal to procure his urine sample) when they took his urine sample in the next breath[^81].

67     Having heard the evidence of SSgt Amir, I was satisfied that the Accused was aware that his urine sample would be procured by SSgt Amir from the urine bag, and consented to it. SSgt Amir proceeded to do so after the Accused had chosen a master bottle and two small bottles from a selection of more than 20 master bottles and 20 small bottles. I was also satisfied that SSgt Amir had taken all the necessary precautions to ensure that there was no contamination when the Accused’s urine was transferred from the urine bag to the master bottle, and subsequently to the two small bottles. SSgt Amir was a trained nurse and was experienced in handling catheters and urine bags.

68     In any event, I found SSgt Amir to be a truthful witness, and the Accused’s assertion that he was in pain at the time when SSgt Amir approached him was not borne out by the evidence of Dr Vetrivel, who testified that the Accused’s pain score was 2 out of a maximum of 10[^82], and the Accused was conscious and alert[^83]. I further rejected the Accused’s belated allegation that SSgt Amir had not provided a selection of master bottles and small bottles for him to choose from. This was never raised by the Accused during his extensive cross-examination of SSgt Amir.

#### (iii)   There was no break in the chain of custody of the urine

69     I further found that there was no break in the chain of custody of the urine sample. I accepted the evidence of SSgt Amir that he apportioned the Accused’s urine sample from the master bottle into the two small bottles, and sealed them with masking tape in the presence of the Accused. The two small bottles were then placed inside a Ziplock bag and “sealed with barcode”[^84].

70     While waiting for the IUT result, the small bottles were temporarily sealed and returned to the Accused. When the IUT test result came back positive, Sgt/2 Assad then proceeded to seal the two small bottles which were on the Accused’s lap, in the presence of the Accused. Sgt/2 Assad removed the two small bottles from the Ziplock bag. After ascertaining that they were not leaking, Sgt/2 Assad passed two HSA labels to the Accused for him to confirm that his name and NRIC number were correct. Thereafter, Sgt/2 Assad affixed the labels onto the two small bottles and the Accused then deposited them into the HSA metal box. The metal box was then placed in the refrigerator by Sgt/2 before he locked it.

71     I disbelieved the Accused’s belated claims (which was only raised during his cross-examination) that the two small bottles were not returned to him and he did not sign on the HSA labels. In fact, in his cross-examination of SSgt Amir, the Accused appeared to accept that the small bottles were returned to him and placed on his lap – his claim at the time of SSgt Amir’s cross-examination was that he was in pain and did not realise that SSgt Amir had placed the small bottles on his lap[^85].

72     The following day, SSgt Gan retrieved the HSA metal box containing the Accused’s urine sample from the refrigerator and submitted the metal box to the HSA. SSgt Gan verified that the two small sealed bottles containing the Accused’s urine sample were in the metal box when it was opened by a HSA officer. I accepted SSgt Gan’s evidence that the Accused’s urine sample was submitted to HSA for analysis. This was also supported by the reports (P9 and P10) prepared by the HSA, which was an independent and neutral agency.

73     The urine sample was analysed by two HSA analysts and found to contain monoacetylmorphine.

#### (iv)   Non-compliance with paragraphs 1, 3(1) and 4 of the First Schedule

74     It was, however, not disputed by the Prosecution that the Accused was not directed to “wash and dry his hands”, did not carry the master bottle and the two small bottles and did not urinate directly into the master bottle.

75     The First Schedule envisages a urine procurement process where a suspect does not have any health issues or physical disabilities inhibiting him from passing urine directly into the master bottle. It can be surmised that the First Schedule was prescribed to, _inter alia_:

> (i)     minimise the risk of contamination of the urine sample by external agents;

> (ii)     ensure that the urine sample in the master bottle is that of the suspect;

> (iii)     ensure that the urine sample which is sent to the HSA for analysis is that of the suspect;

> (iv)     minimise the risk of a suspect’s urine sample being mixed up with someone else’s urine sample; and

> (v)     ensure that the urine sample is not being tampered with.

76     In the present case, the Accused had a catheterisation procedure as Dr Vetrivel found that the Accused had acute urine retention. The Accused also said that he was unable to pass urine. This was therefore not the usual scenario where a suspect was able to “urinate into the master bottle”. The intent behind paragraph 4 is to ensure “that the urine specimen in the master bottle is that of the suspect and not that of any other person”. I therefore did not think that the mere fact that the Accused did not urinate directly into master bottle would, in anyway, prejudice the consumption charge against him. What was critical was that SSgt Amir’s procurement of the Accused’s urine sample from the urine bag was done with the Accused’s knowledge and consent, and there was no contamination of the Accused’s urine sample in the process.

77     Furthermore, I noted that section 31(1) of the MDA states that any officer of CNB may require any person suspected to have committed an offence of drug consumption to _provide_ a specimen of his urine. There is no specification in the MDA that a suspect has to “urinate into the master bottle”, or that the urine specimen must be provided in accordance with “such procedure as may be prescribed”. This is in contrast with the position for dealing with urine specimens under section 31(4) of the MDA, where the MDA provides that the specimen shall be dealt with “in such manner and in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed”.

78     I found that the requirements in section 31(1) of the MDA were complied with – the Accused was observed by the arresting officers to be in a daze, slurred in his speech and unsteady in gait. There was therefore reasons for the officers to suspect that the Accused could have consumed drugs, and the Accused was thus required to _provide_ a sample of his urine. As the Accused was unable to urinate into the master bottle, arrangements were made, with his knowledge and consent, to _provide_ his urine sample from the urine bag instead. Since the urine bag was handled, and the urine sample collected by SSgt Amir and transferred by him to the respective bottles, it was inconsequential whether or not the Accused was directed to wash and dry his hands before his urine sample was collected by SSgt Amir, or whether the Accused had carried the master bottle and the two smaller bottles chosen by him.

79     I was also satisfied that there was no break in the chain of custody of the urine sample from the time it was provided by the Accused and collected by SSgt Amir, to the time it was submitted to the HSA for analysis. There was also no evidence to suggest that the urine sample could have been contaminated in any way, or that monoacetylmorphine could have been introduced into his urine sample before or during the catheterisation procedure[^86].

#### (v)   The operation of section 22 of the MDA

80     The HSA analysis revealed that the Accused’s urine sample contained monoacetylmorphine. The Prosecution retracted its original position that section 22 of the MDA was invoked, and it took the position that section 34(1)(_b_) of the MDA would only be applicable to a urine specimen “provided under … section 31 of the MDA and a urine specimen procured from an accused person’s urine bag would not constitute such a specimen”[^87]. However, the Prosecution submitted that there was sufficient evidence, nonetheless, to convict the Accused of the consumption charge.

81     I disagreed with the Prosecution’s position that a urine specimen procured from an accused person’s urine bag would not constitute a specimen under section 31(1) of the MDA. As I have explained in \[77\] and \[78\], section 31(1) does not have a specific requirement that a suspect must urinate into the master bottle, or that the urine specimen must be provided in accordance with a prescribed procedure. The word “provide” merely means “make available”.

82     I therefore was of the view that section 22 of the MDA operated in the present case as section 31(4)(_b_) was complied with:

> (i)     the Accused provided his urine sample as required under section 31(1) of the MDA;

> (ii)     the Accused’s urine sample was collected by SSgt Amir in the master bottle;

> (iii)     the urine sample was divided into 3 parts;

> (iv)     an IUT was conducted on one part of the urine sample;

> (v)     each of the remaining two parts of the urine sample was marked and sealed; and

> (vi)     a urine test was conducted on each part by a different HSA analyst.

83     Under section 22 of the MDA, if any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person _as a result of both urine tests_ conducted under section 31(4)(_b_), he is presumed to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of the MDA. The Accused was therefore presumed to have consumed monoacetylmorphine. According to the case of _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v PP_ \[2011\]4 SLR 802 at \[10\], this meant that “both the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_” of the consumption charge were presumed. The Accused did not provide any convincing evidence to rebut the presumption and I rejected his belated claim that the urine sample was spike[^88]. As for the Accused’s claim that he has a prostate issue and was unable to urinate normally, I did not see how that could amount to a defence for the consumption charge and for the presence of monacetylmorphine in his urine sample since the Accused was not charged for failure to provide a urine sample without reasonable excuse. Under section 31(2) of the MDA, a person is guilty of an offence if he refuses (without reasonable excuse) to “provide” a urine sample. This was not the case here.

84     In any event, even without relying on section 22 of the MDA, I found that there was sufficient evidence from the evidence from the Prosecution to infer that the Accused had consumed monoacetylmorphine:

> (i)     at the time of arrest, the Accused was observed to be in a daze, having slurred speech and was unsteady in his gait;

> (ii)     diamorphine was found in his possession;

> (iii)     there was no possibility of the urine sample provide by the Accused and collected by SSgt Amir being contaminated or compromised; and

> (iv)     his urine sample was analysed and found to contain monoacetylmorphine.

85     In the circumstances, I found that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the Accused on the consumption charge as well.

## (7)   The sentence

86     An offence under section 8(_a_) punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA is punishable with a minimum term of imprisonment of 2 years and a maximum term of 10 years.

87     An offence under section 8(_b_)(ii) read with section 33A(1) of the MDA is punishable with a minimum term of imprisonment of 7 years and a maximum term of 13 years. The offender shall also be punished with not less than 6 strokes and not more than 12 strokes of the cane. The Accused was not liable to be caned as he was above 50 years of age.

88     The Accused was traced for multiple drug-related and property-related offences since 1984. He was last convicted, and sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane in June 2012 for drug-related and property-related offences.

### (a)   Prosecution’s position on sentence

89     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the consumption charge, and a sentence of 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the possession charge. The Prosecution further informed that it was not seeking a consecutive term and submitted for a global sentence of 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.

### (b)   The mitigation plea

90     The Accused’s mitigation was unremarkable.

### (c)   Decision on sentence

91     Given his antecedents, the Accused was clearly a long term drug user. While it was the Accused’s right to claim trial to the charges, it would mean that the Accused was not entitled to any discount in the sentence, unlike in the case of an accused pleading guilty to his charges in a timeous manner. Further, the Accused had conducted his defence in an aggravating manner by making baseless allegations against the officers, the doctor and the Prosecution, which I found to be untrue. I therefore was of the view that an uplift of the sentence from the mandatory minimum sentence was warranted.

92     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a sentence of 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the possession charge, and a term of 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the consumption charge were appropriate. As the Accused was above the age of 50 years, he was not liable to be caned. I further ordered both sentences to run concurrently, with a global sentence of 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, backdated to the date of remand.

## (8)   Conclusion

93     Having considered the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, both charges against the Accused, and a global sentence of 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

94     As the Accused is in person and this case involves an issue of law, he may benefit from the appointment of an _amicus curiae_.
