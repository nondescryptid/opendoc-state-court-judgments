Criminal Law – Offences – Cheating – Particulars of Charge – Acquittal

6 December 2021

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       At the conclusion of the trial, after having considered all the evidence and the written submissions from the parties, I acquitted the accused of the single charge against him. I provided parties with my brief reasons for the acquittal and indicated that full grounds will be furnished if necessary. No appeal against my order of acquittal was filed. As my reasons for the acquittal were, in fact, relatively detailed, I have decided to release them as my substantive grounds.

## The Charge

2       The accused claimed trial to a single but amalgamated charge for engaging in a conspiracy on 110 occasions with one Ong Kah Heng (“Ong”) to cheat Ong’s employer, SMM Pte Ltd (“SMM”). The charge is for an offence under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 109). For ease of reference, I set out the charge in full as follows:

> You…are charged, in this amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68), that you, on 110 occasions between 2005 and 2012, in Singapore, did embark on a course of conduct of engaging in conspiracies with Ong Kah Heng ("Ong") to cheat SMM Pte Ltd ("SMM"), and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order for doing of that thing, Ong dishonestly concealed from SMM that he would receive a portion of the payments SMM made to Daycon Pte Ltd ("Daycon"),which he was not permitted to do, when awarding jobs to Daycon and by such manner of deception, SMM was dishonestly induced into delivering property to Daycon, to wit, by making a total payment of $1, 072, 029. 54 for these jobs, which acts were committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224).

3       The components of the charge are broken down as follows:

> a.     On 110 occasions between 2005 and 2012, the accused engaged in a conspiracy with Ong to cheat SMM;

> b.     Ong dishonestly concealed from SMM that he (Ong) would receive a portion of the payments that SMM made to the accused’s company, Daycon Pte Ltd (“Daycon”) when he (Ong) was not permitted to do so; and

> c.     By such manner of deception, SMM was dishonestly induced into making a total payment of S$1,072,029.54 in respect of jobs awarded by SMM to Daycon.

## Background Facts

4       The following background facts are not materially disputed.

5       The accused was a director of Daycon which provided waterproofing and related works. The accused has been providing waterproofing works since the 1980s whether through Daycon which he founded, or through previous business entities. SMM had a contract (“main contract”) with MINDEF/DSTA to carry out maintenance works at certain military bases under purview of MINDEF/DSTA. Daycon was one of SMM’s sub-contractors or what parties referred to, in the course of the trial, as a strategic partner (“SP”). Daycon was awarded a contract (“sub-contract”) by SMM to carry out, _inter alia_, waterproofing works at the military bases in the “East Zone”.

6       SMM charges MINDEF/DSTA for carrying out maintenance works according to a schedule of pre-determined rates (“SOR rates”) set out in the main contract. In turn, the SP who is sub-contracted by SMM to perform the maintenance work will give SMM a discount over the SOR rates. Essentially, this discount would be SMM’s profit margin when SMM bills MINDEF/DSTA for the maintenance work done by the SP.

7       It is not in dispute that, for security reasons, the SPs were approved by MINDEF/DSTA. This meant that SMM would not be allowed to award a sub-contract to a sub-contractor which has not been pre-approved by MINDEF/DSTA. Further, SMM’s sub-contracts with the SPs stipulate that the SP may not further sub-contract the work.[^1] The SPs were also confined to performing works within the military bases of specific zones, within the purview of SMM. In other words, an SP with a sub-contract to perform works in respect to military bases in the East Zone would not be allowed to perform works in a military base located in another zone.

8       Without delving into too many details, the typical scenario in which an SP is assigned by SMM to perform maintenance works at a military base would be that the military base (“the user”) would contact SMM’s Technical Officer (“TO”) who was stationed at the said base. The TO would then arrange with the relevant SP, depending on the nature of the work, to attend a site visit with the user and the TO, to be briefed about the nature of the work to be done. The SP would take the necessary measurements onsite and provide a quotation to the TO. The TO would then prepare a ‘Works Order’ specifying:

> i.     The work to be carried out;

> ii.     The cost of the work, including the discount that the SP would extend to SMM;

> iii.     The identity of the SP awarded the work;

> iv.     The date on which the Works Order was issued; and

> v.     The date on which the work was to be completed.[^2]

9       The TO would arrange with the user to provide security clearance for the SP’s workers so that they may enter the base to commence and complete the work. After the work is completed, the TO would arrange for a joint inspection with the user and the SP. Thereafter, the final costs for the completed work would be drawn up. The TO would endorse on the Works Order that the work was satisfactorily completed and the SP would then submit an invoice (supported by the endorsed Works Order) to SMM for payment.

#### Work carried out by non-SPs

10     Ong was called as a prosecution witness. He was in fact the most material witness for the prosecution. Ong was the Principal Facilities Manager of SMM at Paya Lebar Air Base (“PLAB”) at all material times and he supervised a team of TOs.

11     He testified that in or about 2005, he experienced difficulties getting SMM’s SPs to undertake minor works at PLAB because the SPs found the works to be unprofitable. Ong then decided to engage contractors, who were not SMM’s SPs but who were already doing other jobs at PLAB, to carry out these minor works. Ong resorted to engaging these non-SPs so as to undertake the work requested by the users and to complete such work in good time.[^3]

12     It is not in dispute that Ong approached the accused for his assistance to facilitate this arrangement of using non-SPs and paying them for the work done by them. He asked the accused to issue invoices for work done by the non-SPs so that they may be paid for the work done. Ostensibly, the work was carried out by Daycon i.e. an approved SP. The accused was initially reluctant but eventually agreed to help Ong. Ong gave the accused the assurance that the work would be satisfactorily completed by the non-SPs. It was agreed that Daycon would retain 10% of the amount charged for the work done by the non-SPs. This amount was to cover Daycon’s administrative costs of processing the payments as well as Daycon’s potential liability should the work require rectifications. By way of comparison, SMM would retain 22% to 25% of the payment made to its SPs for work done by the SPs. In other words, Daycon’s cut was far less than if SMM had awarded the same work to its SPs.

13     It is not disputed that pursuant to this arrangement (or the conspiracy as the Prosecution would label it), Daycon issued invoices and collected payment from SMM on at least 110 occasions between 2005 and 2012 (as amalgamated in the charge) in respect of the work performed by non-SPs.

14     Arguably, some of the work was carried out in respect of military camps that were not even within SMM’s zone, or that the works lay outside of Daycon’s specialisation or even that the rates quoted were not SOR rates. In my judgment however, nothing material turned on these areas of contention. The Defence’s point with regard to these issues was that the users would have known that the work ought not to have been done by SMM/Daycon or that the workers were not from Daycon. Yet, the users allowed Ong (representing SMM) to arrange for the work to be done which would show that these works must have been approved by MINDEF/DSTA.

15     When the Works Orders/invoices were forwarded to SMM’s Headquarters (“HQ”) for billing purposes, the Defence’s point is that it would also have been obvious to SMM HQ that the work may not have been carried out by Daycon. Therefore, SMM was not deceived and consequently, the offence of cheating was not committed. I did not accept this argument. It was also clear from Ong’s evidence that no one in SMM knew about this arrangement, other than perhaps Ong’s subordinates.[^4] I found that Ong did deceive SMM that the work was carried out by Daycon when it was not. However, as I have explained below, that was not the end of the matter either for the Defence or the Prosecution.

## Prosecution’s Case Against the Accused

16     The Prosecution’s case as set out in the Case for the Prosecution (“CFP”) is summarised as follows:

> a.      In order to obtain reimbursement for his payments to Non-SPs and to obtain a profit from them, Ong proposed to Yap that he would submit invoices through Daycon to SMM for Works done by Non-SPs;

> b.     Ong told Yap that the Works would be carried out by workers he engaged without SMM’s knowledge;

> c.     Yap agreed to submit invoices for Non-SP Works to SMM;

> d.      Ong dishonestly concealed from SMM the fact that he would receive a portion of the payments that SMM made to Daycon;

> e.     Ong knew that, in performing jobs awarded to Daycon he had placed himself in a position of conflict of interest; and

> f.     Both Yap and Ong knew that SMM would not have made payment to Daycon if it knew that Daycon did not perform the work and that the payment would go to Ong.

17     I agree with the Defence’s submission that the alleged deception on SMM comprised of two material aspects:[^5]

> a.     That it was not told that non-SPs had performed the works in lieu of Daycon; _and_

> b.     That it was not told that Ong would receive a profit from the payments made by SMM to Daycon (the “profit component” as highlighted in the CFP set out above).

18     However, the Prosecution’s case at trial is at variance with the CFP, and also with the plain meaning of the charge as framed. Essentially, the Prosecution has glossed over the profit component.

19     The Prosecution’s case at trial is described in the Prosecution’s submissions as one of dishonest concealment and is summarised as follows.[^6]

20     The accused had entered into an arrangement with Ong that the works assigned by SMM to be carried out by Daycon would in fact be performed by non-SP workers at PLAB. This arrangement for the works to be carried out by non-SPs would be in breach of the contract between Daycon and SMM. For every assignment of work that was completed by the non-SPs, the accused submitted a claim to SMM as if the works had been performed by Daycon. SMM was thereby deceived into paying $1,072,029.54 to Daycon for the works that were in fact carried out by the non-SPs.

21     Pursuant to the arrangement (i.e. conspiracy), Daycon retained 10% of each payment received from SMM despite not having performed any of the work, and paid the remaining 90% to Ong against an Ong Teow Eng (“OTE”) invoice. Ong Teow Eng is Ong’s father. SMM was not aware that the works were not performed by Daycon. SMM was also not aware Ong was in fact receiving a significant portion (90%) of the payments that SMM was making to Daycon for the respective works.

## The Defence

22     The accused’s defence is summarised in the Defence’s submissions as follows.[^7]

23     His defence is described to be a straightforward one. At all material times, he believed that SMM was aware of and had approved the use of non-SPs to carry out works which the SPs were unwilling or unable to carry out because it was unprofitable. The accused also believed that SMM had approved that Ong arrange the works to be carried out by non-SPs (because SPs would not do it and also because Ong has done so in the past) but that the non-SPs would be paid by SMM through Daycon.

24     For the avoidance of doubt, the Defence does not contend that SMM had, as a matter of fact, approved the use of Daycon to make payments to non-SPs. The Defence submitted that it is sufficient, for the purposes of refuting the charge, to simply establish that the accused believed that SMM had approved the same.

25     The Defence also contended that Ong was clothed with ostensible authority to instruct non-SPs to perform the work, considering that at all material times between 2005 and 2012, Ong was the most senior representative of SMM who had dealt with the accused. It was therefore reasonable and logical for the accused to believe that Ong was authorised to make requests of Daycon in his capacity as SMM’s most senior representative. The Defence submitted that given Ong’s relative senior position at SMM, coupled with his stated objective of ensuring that SMM completed works on time (which objective is not in dispute), these factors would have made Ong’s request credible and would not have given rise to any ‘red flags’ that would have aroused the accused’s suspicions.

26     More importantly, the accused denies any knowledge that Ong was receiving or taking a cut of the payments that were meant for the non-SPs. Ong did not tell him that and that was not part of the arrangement with Ong. In other words, the scope of the accused’s agreement with Ong’s arrangement is limited i.e. he only agreed to submit Daycon invoices to SMM for the work done by the non-SPs.

27     The accused believed that after deducting 10% to pay Daycon for administrative expenses, Ong would then pay the balance to the non-SPs for the work carried out by them.

## Verdict

28     The accused was acquitted of the charge at the conclusion of the trial.

## Reasons for Acquittal

29     The Prosecution’s case against the accused is grounded squarely on the testimony of Ong who is the alleged accomplice. The Prosecution is keenly aware of the importance of Ong’s evidence.[^8] It is not in dispute that Ong was charged for cheating his employer, SMM, and he has already pleaded guilty and have been convicted of the offence, albeit on a reduced charge. There is no question that he testified as an accomplice in the present trial.

30     In respect of an accomplice’s evidence, iIllustration (b) of s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97) provides that the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution. Notwithstanding this statutory caution, I am also mindful of the guidance provided by the High Court in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ \[1996\] 1 SLR 510 (“_Chai Chien Wei_”) that:

31     Whether or not the court should believe the evidence of the accomplice depended on all the circumstances of the case and the evidence must be tested against the objective facts as well as the inherent probabilities and improbabilities; but where the court did not discern any attempt by the accomplice materially to minimise his own involvement or exaggerate that of the accused and his evidence was found to be consistent as a whole and reliable on a review of the whole evidence, there was no reason why the evidence should be treated as unreliable.

32     Bearing in mind that the onus was on the prosecution to prove the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, Ong’s testimony was therefore critical and had to be carefully scrutinised. I therefore considered and weighed Ong’s evidence very carefully to see if indeed his evidence showed, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused was complicit in the cheating offence both in terms of the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_. As it turned out, the cautionary reminder was unnecessary. Ong’s evidence did not, to my mind, implicate the accused to the extent required to prove the accused’s complicity in the offence as averred in the charge.

#### Charge is ambiguous/Prosecution’s case unclear

33     At the outset, I agree with the Defence’s submission that there is much ambiguity in the charge.[^9] The ambiguity in the charge is compounded by the shift in Prosecution’s position as mentioned above. The ambiguity centres around the material phrase within the charge “_receive a portion of the payments”_. I interprete this phrase (and likewise the Defence) to allege and mean that Ong had profited by pocketing a portion of the payments and then paid the remainder to the non-SPs for the work done by them. As indicated above, there was a profit component to the conspiracy to cheat which is consistent with the wording and meaning of the phrase.

34     However, the Prosecution contended that the phrase simply means that Daycon had paid “a portion of” the payments to Ong, completing ignoring or glossing over the downstream flow of the monies.[^10] In reality and substance, Daycon kept _a portion of_ the payments (i.e. 10%) and gave the bulk of the payments to Ong for Ong to pay the non-SPs. In other words, it was Ong who had given _a portion of_ the payments to Daycon for using Daycon’s name. The Prosecution has unfortunately turned the natural meaning of the phrase “_a portion of_” on its head. I wholly agree with the Defence that any ambiguity in the charge must be resolved in favour of the accused.

35     Ong himself had pleaded guilty to a corresponding but reduced charge of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code. The Prosecution’s case against Ong was that he deviced the scheme “\[i\]_n order to get reimbursement for these expenses and obtain a profit from the same_.”[^11] I note that this sentence is replicated in the CFP in respect of the present case. Ong’s SOF also stated that Ong had pocketed up to $60,000 from the payments made by SMM to Daycon.[^12] As against the accused, I agree with the Defence’s submission that the “goalpost” has materially shifted. Now, as evident from the Prosecution’s submission[^13], the allegation is that Ong had received 90% of the payments, less the 10% given to Daycon.

36     It is not made clear in the charge whether “receive” is equated with pocketing or profiteering. On a plain reading, it would appear so. Otherwise, the charge would not make any sense because it would be doubtful, in my view, if the mere receipt of 90% of the payments in order to pay the non-SPs for the work done (i.e. the “conduit” sense as referenced by the Defence) would amount to an offence of cheating. Ong’s evidence (which the Prosecution did not formally challenge) was that he used 90% of the payments to pay the non-SPs for the works carried out by them, or else to reimburse himself because he had already paid them for the work. The thrust of Ong’s evidence was that _he did not profit_ from the payments. If so, there would be no dishonesty on the part of Ong and consequently, he would not be guilty of having cheated SMM because he would not have intended any wrongful gain to himself or wrongful loss to his employer, SMM. In this regard, the Prosecution does accept that one of the ingredients of an offence of cheating is that there must be a dishonest intention to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain.[^14]

37     Therefore, the only way to make sense of the charge is that the allegation must be that Ong had taken a cut of the payments i.e. the charge encompasses a profit component. On that premise, the conspiracy to cheat is allegedly for Ong to cheat SMM by deceiving SMM into believing that the work was done by Daycon when it was in fact done by non-SPs, _and_ for Ong to take a cut from the payments made by SMM to Daycon. I therefore take the view that there are two components to the offence of conspiracy to cheat on the face of the charge. There is no question that Ong had deceived SMM into believing that Daycon had done the work. There is is also no question that the accused agreed and was complicit in this first part of the conspiracy to deceive SMM. However, this was not the more critical component of the deception because it is not disputed that all the works had been completely and satisfactorily performed, albeit by the non-SPs and not Daycon.

38     The second component (i.e. the profit component) of the offence which, to my understanding, is the gravamen of the charge is that “_Ong dishonestly concealed from SMM that he would receive a portion of the payments SMM made to Daycon_” because it is “_by such manner of deception_” that “_SMM was dishonestly induced into delivering property to Daycon_” i.e. making payments to Daycon. This was the primary deception because, as averred in the charge, he received a portion of the payments “_which he was not permitted to do_.” The Prosecution led evidence from the managerial and accounting representatives of SMM[^15] to establish not only that Daycon is not allowed to sub-contract the work to non-SPs but _also_ that Ong was not permitted to receive money from sub-contractors because that would amount to a conflict of interest. By “receipt” or “receiving”, it must mean receiving the money beneficially and not receiving the money so as to pay the sub-contractors for work done. Curiously, that is the meaning of “receipt” or “receiving” which the Prosecution relied on when it made reference to an exchange during the cross-examination of the accused where the accused said that “_I can only say that taking money is wrong, because it’s taking additional money._”[^16] In that sense, Ong did not “take money” or take “_additional money_.”

#### Charge not proved

39     On the basis of how the charge ought to be read and understood, I found that the Prosecution had not proved _beyond reasonable doubt_ that (i) Ong had received a cut of the payments; or (ii) that the accused knew of and agreed for Ong to receive a cut of the payments.

#### _(i) Whether Ong took a cut_

40     I was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ong had deceived and cheated SMM in the manner as stated in the charge i.e. that he “_dishonestly concealed from SMM that he would receive a portion of the payments SMM made to_ \[Daycon\]_, which he was not permitted to do_.” If so, the question as to whether the accused was complicit in the cheating offence as averred in the charge, would not even arise. The Defence also submitted, which I agree, that the Prosecution has not adduced evidence that Ong had made any profit or derived any personal benefit from the transactions set out in the charge.[^17]

41     Ong was prosecution’s most material witness. He testified that it was his idea to engage non-SPs to perform the work and that the accused was ‘reluctant’ to agree with his idea. Ong also took it upon himself to give the accused a 10% cut of the payments that SMM paid to Daycon. Ong would then prepare an invoice, as requested by the accused, for the accused to properly account for the remaining 90% to be paid to the non-SPs for the work done. It is not in dispute that the invoices were in fact fictitious invoices allegedly paid to the name of Ong’s father (Ong Teow Eng).[^18] Ong admitted that he did not use his own name because there would be a conflict of interest.[^19] When the learned DPP asked Ong if anyone knew that he was using his father’s name to receive the payments from Daycon, he replied no one knew.[^20] In fact, short of asking a leading question, the learned DPP asked Ong three times if anyone knew but Ong’s answer was that no one knew. Ong had in fact lied to the accused initially that he would be using a relative’s name but subsequently when asked if the name was Ong’s father, Ong then said yes.[^21] It may thus be seen that Ong was not entirely truthful with the accused.

42     The Prosecution’s case is that Ong had pocketed some $20,000 – $60,000 from the payments made by SMM to Daycon.[^22] This was by no means a small sum of profit. It was accepted that the accused’s cut was 10%. The learned DPP also asked Ong whether he likewise took a cut of the payments. If the charge did not encompass a profit component, there would have been no need for the Prosecution to ask that question. Nevertheless, the question was asked but Ong was most reluctant to admit that he profiteered from the payments as well. He said that there was no benefit to him.[^23] At its highest, the thrust of Ong’s oral testimony was that there was hardly any benefit, if at all, to him. In fact, Ong said he suffered losses for some of the contracts.[^24] The prosecution did not ask Ong to quantify or else elaborate on his benefits, if any. Ultimately, while it is accepted that Ong would use the payments from SMM to pay the non-SPs for the work done[^25], Ong did not specifically admit that he had made a profit of the payments. At its highest, his testimony was ambiguous as to whether he took a cut of the said payments made by SMM to Daycon.

43     For completeless, two documents were tendered as part of prosecution’s case which indicated that Ong took a cut of the payments. These documenst were (i) the SOF[^26] which Ong admitted when he pleaded guilty to his own charge, and (ii) emails[^27] that Ong sent to SMM’s management acknowledging that his profit was only about 8-10%. However, this profit component as reflected in these documents was not specifically highlighted to Ong by the prosecution for his confirmation or denial. In fact, Ong appeared to be wanting to retract his previous plea of guilt when the learned DPP asked him about the charge that was preferred against him.[^28] He further added that he did not fully agree with the SOF and also that he had no choice but to admit to the SOF.[^29] At the end of the day, the Prosecution did not impeach or challenge Ong’s position (that there was little or no profit to him) by confronting him with the material and incriminating portions of the emails or the SOF.

#### _(ii) Whether accused knew that Ong took a cut_

44     I agree with the Defence’s submission that the Prosecution has not adduced any evidence, either through Ong or any other witness, that the accused knew that Ong would be taking a cut from the payments. I believed the accused’s evidence that Ong did not disclose to him and he did not know that Ong kept part of the payments for himself. As highlighted above, Ong was not entirely forthright with the accused in the arrangement. In fact, the accused was reluctant to let Ong use Daycon’s name in the arrangement. I therefore believed the accused’s evidence that he did not know that the accused would profiteer from the payments that were meant for the non-SPs.

#### Accused’s defence materially accepted

45     That said, I do not accept the accused’s defence that he thought Ong was authorised by SMM to instruct non-SPs to perform the works in question. His initial reluctance to accede to Ong’s request to use Daycon’s name showed as much. For the purposes of these brief grounds, I will not go into the detailed reasons as to why this aspect of the accused’s defence is rejected.

46     The accused accepted that he billed SMM for the work that was not carried out by Daycon. He also admitted that Daycon took a cut of the payments. However, he was steadfast in this other aspect of his defence that he was _not_ told by Ong and was _not_ aware that Ong was also taking a cut of the payments that was meant for the non-SPs who had done the work. I accept the accused’s testimony that he reluctantly agreed to Ong using Daycon’s name because he truly believed that Ong had difficulty engaging SPs to do the work and that Ong was not personally and financially benefitting from this arrangement. His initial reluctance was acknowledged by the Prosecution.[^30]

47     The accused was consistent in this material portion of his defence throughout his statements. The Prosecution also submitted at length regarding the many statements made by the accused and which were tendered in evidence. The accused did not admit in any of the statements that he was told or that he knew that Ong was profiteering from the payments made to Daycon.

48     At the end of the day, I believed the accused to be telling the truth, which is materially supported by Ong’s evidence. I also do not find that the evidence adduced by the Prosecution would lead the court to the inexorable inference that the accused knew that Ong would pocket for himself a cut of the payments meant for the non-SPs.

## Burden on Prosecution

49     It is trite and bears repeating that the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the trial court must always bear in mind that the starting point of the analysis of any criminal case is not neutral but that an accused is presumed innocent and this presumption is not displaced until the prosecution has discharged its burden of proof: _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at \[61\]; _Jayasekara Arachchilage Hemantha Neranjan Gamini v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 689</span> at \[1\] - \[2\]. Where there is a reasonable doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused. This consequence is inherent in the burden on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt: _PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ \[2008\] 1 SLR (R) 601 at \[34\]. In the present case, I am not satisfied that that prosecution has discharged its burden.

## Conclusion

50     I was of the view that the charge was woefully ambiguous. The thrust of the charge, as I read it, is that Ong is alleged to have beneficially taken a cut of the payments i.e. “receiving a portion of” the payments. That is the only way to read it for the allegations against Ong (and consequently the accused) to make any sense. The alternative interpretation as submitted by the Prosecution would not constitute an offence.

51     On the premise of my reading of the charge, Ong’s evidence did not support the allegation that he had received a cut of the payments, let alone that he told the accused that he would take a cut. The thrust of Ong’s evidence is that he sourced for the non-SP workers to perform the works in question because the SPs were reluctant to do so. He then paid the non-SPs with the money that SMM paid to Daycon. Conversely, it was Daycon which received _a portion of_ the payments. Therefore, Ong did not materially implicate the accused as being complicit in any offence of cheating.

52     I believed the accused’s evidence as regards the profit component of the charge which I find to be consistent with what Ong had informed him or not inform him. I also find no other evidence to incriminate the accused in respect of the charge.

53     Accordingly, I find that the prosecution has not discharged its burden of proving its case beyond reasonsonable doubt. For the above reasons which are set out briefly, I acquit the accused of the charge.
