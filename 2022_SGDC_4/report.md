Contract – Claim for outstanding sum

Building and construction – Scope of works

Evidence – Burden of proof

7 January 2022

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Background

1       The plaintiff is a general contractor. The defendant is in the business of general building engineering services[^1].

2       In June 2015, the defendant was appointed the subcontractor for the supply and installation of mechanical services (fire protection, plumbing and sanitary and ACMV installation) at a construction project at Mandai Road (“the Project”). The main contractor for the Project was a company called Forvis Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd (“Forvis”). The Project entailed the construction of a foreign workers’ dormitory complex comprising four blocks of four-storey dormitory buildings, two blocks of two-storey ancillary/administrative buildings, a block of single storey with provision for commercial facilities, indoor and outdoor recreational amenities facilities (2000 workers) [^2].

3       By way of a Works Order dated 18 August 2015[^3], the defendant appointed the plaintiff as the sub-subcontractor for the installation of the sanitary and plumbing systems for the Project at a lump sum of $160,000. The detailed scope of the plaintiff’s works was provided at Annex A to the Works Order[^4]. The plaintiff’s works were to commence on 1 August 2015 and be completed by 5 December 2015 to meet the main contractor’s schedule. At all material times, the plaintiff’s representatives had dealt with one Rajendran Saravanaprakash _aka_ Sara (“DW3”), the defendant’s project manager and representative.

4       The original subcontractor for the plaintiff’s scope of works was another entity called Sing Teck Engineering & Construction (“Sing Teck”). Sing Teck had aborted the works which led to the defendant appointing the plaintiff as the subcontractor to complete the installation of the sanitary and plumbing systems.

5       The Works Order stipulated the following payment terms:

> a.     Progress Claim with verification drawings, quantity and photos to be submitted within 7 days for the works completed for previous month.

> b.     Payment will be 30 days from date of Progress Claim.

> c.     Progress Claim will be certified based (_sic._) percentage of works completed and not on number of workers deployed.

6       There was a clause for a retention sum worded as follows:

> 10% retention until completion of project and 5% retention through Defects Liability Period of minimum 12 months. Defects on installation must be attended during Defects Liability Period.

7       Pursuant to the Works Order, the plaintiff had carried out the various installation works and submitted a total of four progress claims as detailed below[^5]:

> (a)     Progress Claim PC-01 dated 31 August 2015 for $27,100.00

> (b)     Progress Claim PC-02 dated 30 September 2015 for $58,805.50

> (c)     Progress Claim PC-03 dated 21 October 2015 for $93,115.00

> (d)     Progress Claim PC-04 dated 5 December 2015 for $113,200.00.

8       The first two progress claims were paid by the defendant although payment was not made in full and beyond the timeline stipulated in the Works Order. Progress Claim PC-03 was not paid and the claim therein was subsumed in Progress Claim PC-04. According to the claim in PC-04, the plaintiff had completed 100% of all the works listed in the Works Order as at 5 December 2015. In Progress Claim PC-04, a sum of $29,050 was initially included as variation works[^6]. A subsequent version of PC-04 dated 20 June 2016 had revised the variation works amount to $43,570.00[^7].

9       Disputes arose between the parties relating to non-payment and the scope of the plaintiff’s works from leading to a purported cancellation of the Works Order in October 2015. The main contractor, Forvis, had intervened as it did not want any change of subcontractors at that stage of the Project. The plaintiff encountered difficulties in the execution of the works due in part to internal issues that DW3 had with his principals which has led to a third party action taken out by the defendant against DW3.

10     On 7 December 2015, the defendant terminated the plaintiff’s sub-contract and demanded that all of the plaintiff’s workers leave the worksite. As no further payment was made by the defendant, the plaintiff commenced this action in January 2016.

## Plaintiff’s claim

11     The pleaded claim of the plaintiff is simply that it had completed the works and issued Progress Claim PC-04 for the sum of $113,200 dated 5 December 2015. It further claims the sum of $8,000 being 5% of the contract sum being the retention sum which was to be maintained through the defects liability period of 12 months.

12     Accordingly, the plaintiff claimed the sum of $121,200 or such other sum as the court may find due from the defendant.

## Defendant’s defence and counterclaim

13     The defendant denied that the plaintiff had completed the works. It referred to the plaintiff’s Progress Claim PC-03 for October 2015 which claimed that 99.75% of the works had been completed when in fact a substantial amount of the works was still outstanding. This was evidenced by a list of 94 items of outstanding works which had been compiled by the main contractor. In breach of the agreement, the plaintiff had failed to complete the outstanding works.

14     Further, the defendant asserted that the works undertaken by the plaintiff had been done badly, without skill and care and in an improper and unworkmanlike manner. The defendant had to engage various other subcontractors to make good and rectify the works which were badly done by the plaintiff including specific items such as:

> (a)     to carry out leak test survey and pressure test;

> (b)     to detect and repair underground / concealed water pipe leakage;

> (c)     to carry out CIPP (Cured In Place Pipe Lining) procedure to the sewer line (Rehabilitation method); and

> (d)     to carry out heavy cleaning to one number of sewer line.

15     The total sum allegedly expended by the defendant for rectification works was $102,545.83 comprising payments made to various third parties as itemised below[^8]:

16     In addition to the rectification works, the defendant pleaded that the plaintiff had claimed for works which had been undertaken by the previous subcontractor, Sing Teck. It also denied that the plaintiff was entitled to any sums for variation works as all the works performed were within the plaintiff’s original scope of works.

17     The defendant further denied that the plaintiff was entitled to the sum of $8,000 being the retention monies as it did not at any time hold any part of the contract sum from the plaintiff. Additionally, the defendant claimed that it had incurred further sums on account of missing sanitary ware which had been delivered to the plaintiff’s custody as well as other payments made on behalf of the plaintiff.

18     The defendant’s counterclaim is for a total sum of $117,099.21 which it seeks to set off against the plaintiff’s claim. The particulars of the counterclaim are set out below[^9]:

## Plaintiff’s defence to the counterclaim

19     As to the list of outstanding works from the main contractor, the plaintiff claimed that all the items had been attended to and completed to the satisfaction of the main contractor save for one minor item (item 6d in the Works Order)[^10]. In respect of the underground pipes, all pressure testing had been done and it was only after the Project’s Resident Technical Officer or main contractor’s representative was satisfied that the underground trenches would be cast with concrete or back-filled.

20     On the claim for rectification works, the plaintiff’s response was that due to the defendant’s conduct in terminating the contract, it had been prevented from carrying out the rectification works which it could have done during the Defects Liability Period. The defendant’s claims for the leak and pressure test surveys, and the CIPP procedure to rectify the sewer line were denied as these did not form part of the plaintiff’s scope of work in the Works Order.

21     The defendant’s claim for rectification costs due to leakage was denied as the damage to the pipes was not caused by the plaintiff but by other contractors’ works which had been notified to the defendant.

22     The plaintiff maintained its claim for variation works in PC-04 on the basis that all the items of work had been carried out on DW3’s instructions. It also averred that it was entitled to payment of the retention sum of $8,000 since the contract had been wrongly terminated by the defendant on 5 December 2015.

23     The plaintiff denied that it had claimed for works which had been performed by the previous subcontractor as the scope of its work was separate from that undertaken by Sing Teck.

24     As to the defendant’s claim that the plaintiff had to cover the loss of sanitary ware, the plaintiff denied that it ever had custody of the items and averred that it should be not held liable for the defendant’s failures or negligence since the defendant did not even engage a storeman at the Project site. The claim for the plaintiff to contribute to the 7th month prayers was dismissed on the basis that this was a voluntary payment made by the defendant.

## Issues

25     From the matters raised in the pleadings, the issues arising from the plaintiff’s claim are:

> (a)     whether the plaintiff had completed 100% of the items listed in the Works Order as claimed in PC-04,

> (b)     whether the defendant had authorised the variation works claimed, and

> (c)     what is the amount to be paid to the plaintiff on its claim for the balance sum due for the works completed under the Works Order.

26     The issues arising from the defendant’s counterclaim are:

> (a)     whether the defendant’s payments to other contractors were:

>> (i)       to rectify defective works carried out by the plaintiff; or

>> (ii)       to complete the plaintiff’s scope of work under the Works Order; and

> (b)     whether the defendant is entitled to impose back-charges and other sums against the plaintiff.

### Whether the plaintiff had completed 100% of the items listed in the Works Order as claimed in PC-04

27     As the plaintiff’s pleaded claim rests on PC-04, it must prove that all the items listed in the Works Order have been completed as set out therein. There appear to be different iterations of PC-04 relied on by the parties. Since there is no agreed bundle of documents, the court will have to rely on the version adduced in the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) of its senior supervisor, Sundaraj Lingam (“PW3”), who was in charge of executing the works for the plaintiff[^11]. PW3 was also the plaintiff’s representative who had been approached by the defendant to quote for the works in the first place[^12].

28     The claim in PC-04 was for works completed up to 5 December 2015. Every single item of work was claimed at 100%. The summary of the claim in PC-04 is set out below:

29     The evidence adduced at trial from the witnesses, however, did not support the plaintiff’s case that the work done was at 100%, as outlined below:

> (a)      Evidence of Sambandam Maheswaran (PW1):

>> PW1, the plaintiff’s director, testified that the person who prepared the progress claim was PW2[^13]. PW1 had no personal knowledge of the matters pertaining to the works and referred to Hyder Ali Faiyazu Rahman (“PW2”) and Sundaraj Lingam (“PW3”) as the individuals who would know whether the plaintiff had completed its scope of works.

> (b)      Evidence of Hyder Ali Faiyazu Rahman (PW2):

>> When PW2 was asked whether the plaintiff had completed the works by 26 November 2015, the deadline given by the main contractor, he admitted that the work was incomplete but sought to deflect blame on the defendant for not providing support[^14]. Up to the final deadline of 5 December 2015 given by the main contractor, the works were still incomplete.[^15] PW2 subsequently qualified his evidence and reduced the percentage of the total work completed to 95% of the contract[^16].

> (c)      Evidence of Sundaraj Lingam, PW3:

>> During cross-examination, PW3 testified that about five to seven percent of the work had yet to be completed in early December 2015[^17]. He claimed that DW3 did not give the plaintiff’s workers time to complete the works even though they were prepared to stay on and do the repairs.

> (d)      Evidence of the defendant’s site representative / project manager, DW3:

>> The defendant’s representative, Surendran Nair s/o Ayyapan (“DW1”) had testified that the evaluation of the works for the Mandai project was done by DW3[^18].

>> DW3 who testified under a subpoena conceded that the plaintiff had completed about 90% of the works by end November 2015. This was by reference to the main contractor’s certification of the progress claim submitted by the defendant for payment. He also agreed that in respect of the list of 94 outstanding items, these were minor works which would not take long to complete[^19].

30     While there appears to be consensus from the witnesses that the scope of the remaining works as at end November 2015 was minor and involved essentially the items on the punchlist from the main contractor, this does not detract from the fact that the plaintiff should not have claimed in PC-04 for 100% of the value of the works when it in fact had not fulfilled 100% of its contractual obligation. From the evidence adduced, the court has to find that the plaintiff had not completed 100% of the works as claimed

### Whether the defendant had agreed and/or authorised the variations

31     The total amount of variations claimed in the revised PC-04 was $43,570. This was comprised in 12 variation orders (“VO”) as tabulated in annexure A of PC-04 and extracted below:

32     None of the plaintiff’s three witnesses had adduced the VOs in their AEICs to support its claim of $43,570.00. As such, the actual documents that the plaintiff was relying on to claim the amount for variation works had not been positively identified. The failure of the plaintiff’s witnesses to do so added to the confusing nature of the evidence which they tendered to the court.

33     At the outset, the claim amount for the variation works referred to in PW1’s and PW2’s AEICs was a different figure and stated to be erroneous. From the figure cited, it was obvious that neither of these witnesses was referring to the claim amount of $43,570.00 in the revised PC-04 adduced by PW3 in his AEIC. They were referring to the original PC-04 submitted by PW1 to the defendant on 7 December 2015 which was referred to as the “Final Progressive claim”[^20]. The claim for variation works was then $29,050 and comprised in 10 VOs[^21].

34     The earlier figure is inconsistent with that claimed in the revised PC-04, but there is no explanation or documents to clarify the discrepancy. Notably, although the original PC-04 and revised PC-04 had stated that the claim was “(t)ill Date 05/12/2015”, the amount for the variation works had increased substantially from $29,050 to $43,570.

35     The extent of the evidence given by the witnesses about the variations is outlined below:

> (a)      Evidence of PW2:

>> In PW2’s AEIC, he stated that:

>>> 34.    The variation works for the sum of $30,560.00 were annexed to Progress Claim 04. In the annex, there was an error in calculation. If one were to add up the amounts stated in each Variation Order, the total amount is $30,560.00.

>>> …

>>> 41.    All variation works done were done at the instruction of Sara. When Variation Orders were tendered, Sara avoided the same and refused to sign the documents, assuring the Plaintiff that all payments would be duly made. The Defendant cannot now deny the Plaintiff of these payments. I refer to paragraphs 19 and 20 of Lingam’s AEIC.

> (b)      Evidence of PW3:

>> In paragraphs 19 and 20 of PW’s AEIC, no elaboration was given of the nature of the variation works. Instead, what was mentioned was the plaintiff’s grievances with how DW3 had conducted himself. See below:

>>> 19.    Whenever there were variation works to be done, Sara would give me the instructions verbally. When I raised objections that these should be formally requested, Sara always said not to worry, that the Plaintiff would be paid accordingly for all variation works. The Plaintiff, on those assurances, therefore went ahead to do the variation works as instructed by Sara. Given that there was no other representative of the Defendant that we knew of, there was also nobody with whom we could verify the instructions.

>>> 20.    When the Plaintiff raised the formal variation orders and presented them to Sara, he refused to sign them and continued saying that they were unnecessary, not to worry, and that the Plaintiff would be paid for all variation works.

> (c)      Evidence of DW3:

>> In cross-examination, DW3 was referred to documents in the plaintiff’s bundle of documents bearing the heading “Site Instruction Form” in which site instructions were recorded by the plaintiff[^22]. It is unclear whether these are the variation orders relied on by the plaintiff. The documents do not bear any signature and have not been acknowledged by the defendant. There is no explanation or reference as to how the rates stated therein were calculated. While DW3 acknowledged that he had received the email from the plaintiff with these documents, he said that he had been instructed not to evaluate them.

>> Hence, there is no available evidence as to value of the variation work even if the court were to accept that the documents titled as “Site Instruction Forms” are equivalent to VOs.

36     From my review of the evidence, the plaintiff’s claim in PC-04 for variation works amounting to $43,570.00 has not been proven. While there is some admission by DW3 that the plaintiff had done “partially” some VO work[^23], there is no objective evidence upon which the court can find what items of the 12 VOs claimed in PC-04 had been approved and what value to assign to those works. In the result, the plaintiff’s claim in PC-04 for variation works amounting to $43,570.00 is not proven and has to be dismissed.

### What is the amount to be paid to the plaintiff on its claim for the balance sum due for the works completed under the Works Order?

37     At the commencement of the trial, the plaintiff’s claim was for the sum of $121,200 consisting of $113,200 being the balance outstanding sum under PC-04 and $8,000 being the retention sum of 5% of the contract sum. It then applied to amend its statement of claim to include the words “and or such sum as the Court may find due from the Defendant to the Plaintiff”.

38     In its closing submissions, the plaintiff had submitted that the total balance due under the contract is $131,448 with the breakdown as follows:

>   
| 

PC-04 claim

 | 

$123,448

 |
| 

Add retention 5% to be released to the plaintiff

 | 

$8,000

 |
| 

**Total balance due**

 | 

**$131,448**

 |

  
  

39     The plaintiff also submitted two other computations for the court’s consideration. The first was premised on the plaintiff being entitled to the full contract value of $160,000 while the second was given on the basis of the plaintiff having completed 95% of the works as shown below:

>

**Total balance due**

**$135,733.00**

 |

  
  

40     From my assessment of the evidence, I had found that the plaintiff had not completed 100% of the works as claimed. As such, there is no basis to find that the balance due is either $131,448 or $143,733.

41     As for the alternative computation based on 95% completion of the works, this is also not supported by the evidence of DW3. The plaintiff had in the cross-examination of DW3 referred him to the defendant’s own claim to the main contractor for its entire subcontract works and the certification by Forvis[^24]. From the figures set out in Progress Payment No. 5 for works completed up to end October 2015, the defendant had claimed for close to 98% of the plumbing installation while for the sanitary installation, it was 99%. Forvis had verified the quantity of work for plumbing installation at about 72% while that for sanitary installation was at 83%.[^25] DW3 had explained that the scope of the plaintiff’s work was only a portion of the scope of the defendant’s subcontract. There was therefore no direct correlation between the plaintiff’s claim made to the defendant and the defendant’s claim to Forvis. It was not a back-to-back subcontract. As such, Forvis’s certification of the plumbing and sanitary installations could not be relied on by the plaintiff to value the quantity of the plaintiff’s work under the Works Order.

42     Since DW3 was the defendant’s representative tasked to verify the works completed by the plaintiff, the evidence given by him would be particularly relevant in the court’s consideration of the work completed by the plaintiff. From an overall assessment of the evidence, it was not possible for the court to find that the plaintiff had completed up to 95% of the works contracted under the Works Order as submitted by the plaintiff[^26].

43     Regardless of whether the plaintiff was relying on the original PC-04 as pleaded in its statement of claim[^27] or the revised PC-04 (with the figures summarised in \[28\] above), the task of the court is to assess on the evidence adduced whether the plaintiff has proven its pleaded claim on a balance of probabilities. The conflicting figures presented in the AEICs of its witness without explanation for the discrepancies did not assist the court in making a finding in its favour on any of the three permutations presented in its closing submissions.

44     In short, the plaintiff’s claim has to be dismissed as it has failed to discharge its burden of proof.

### Whether the defendant’s payment to other contractors was to complete or rectify defects under the plaintiff’s scope of work

45     The defendant’s counterclaim which it seeks to set-off against the plaintiff’s claim arises from payments that it had made to various contractors due allegedly to the plaintiff’s failure to complete the works or to rectify the defective works carried out by the plaintiff[^28]. Specifically, the following invoices were relied on:

> (a)     Johnson Pacific Pte Ltd’s Tax Invoice No. 00009782 dated 17 December 2015 for $13,910[^29],

> (b)     Johnson Pacific Pte Ltd’s Tax Invoice No. 00009808 dated 29 January 2016 for $22,470[^30],

> (c)     Johnson Pacific Pte Ltd’s Tax Invoice No. 00009809 dated 29 January 2016 for $2,140[^31],

> (d)     MainWell Engineering & Services’ Invoice No. MWES 16-01-024 dated 4 January 2016 for $11,040[^32],

> (e)     FT Plumbing Construction Pte Ltd’s Tax Invoice No. 000455 dated 25 January 2016 for $23,712.27[^33],

> (f)     FT Plumbing Construction Pte Ltd’s Tax Invoice No. 000457 dated 18 March 2016 for $9,638.56[^34],

> (g)     Sai Veera Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd’s Invoice Ref. 16/01/0002 dated 2 January 2016 for $1,810[^35],

> (h)     Sai Veera Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd’s Invoice Ref. 16/01/0004 dated 16 March 2016 for $2,100[^36], and

> (i)     Sai Veera Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd’s Invoice Ref. 16/01/0005 dated 19 March 2016 for $700[^37].

46     Voluminous documents had been compiled into the AEIC of DW1 purportedly to show the breaches and failures of the plaintiff. They included the invoices identified above. However, DW1’s evidence has to be viewed with caution as he was not the person managing the subcontractor onsite. A significant part of his evidence appeared to be constructed from a perusal of the documents and did not reflect the actual dealings between the parties. An example is that of the engagement of the licensed plumber for the purposes of the commissioning of the piping and sanitary system[^38]. DW1 had insisted that the plaintiff was required to have a licensed plumber in order to carry out the works under the Works Order. Notably, this was never part of the defendant’s pleaded case.

47     From DW3’s explanation of the scope of the contract, it was clear that the engagement of a licensed plumber required for the testing and commissioning of the plumbing and sanitary systems was the obligation of the defendant and not that of the plaintiff[^39]. The scope of the plaintiff’s contract was much narrower than what DW1 had sought to portray. As DW3 was the defendant’s site representative and had dealt with the issues at site, his evidence has to be accorded greater weight.

48     It is my finding that the plaintiff’s scope of works was for the supply of labour, tools and excavator to carry out sanitary and plumbing installations for the Project with all materials to be supplied by the defendant. The location of the works which the plaintiff was contracted to do was also stipulated in the Works Order, _ie_ “Blk A1/A2, Blk B1/B2, Commercial Block, Facilities Block 1 & 2 and External Areas.” The plaintiff’s sub-contract with the defendant was not a back-to-back contract with what the defendant had with Forvis. The counterclaim of the defendant must accordingly be evaluated on this premise.

#### Johnson Pacific Pte Ltd

49     The defendant had paid a total of $38,520 to Johnson Pacific Pte Ltd (“Johnson”) comprising the tax invoices in \[45 (a) to (c)\] above which they seek to claim against the plaintiff.

50     According to DW1’s evidence, the defendant had to engage Johnson to carry out flow tests and hydrostatic testing of the underground water pipes which the plaintiff was required to have done by 13 November 2015 but failed to do. When Johnson tested the system in the first week of December 2015, the tests failed. Multiple leaks were found in the underground water distribution main pipe and sanitary underground pipes.

51     The defendant also engaged Johnson to do the leak test survey and pressure test to the sewers. After completing the tests which found damage to the pipes, the defendant engaged Johnson to a carry out CIPP (Cured-in-place pipe) repairs to the damaged sewer pipes. Concrete had been found in one inspection chamber (IC 18) for which Johnson was also engaged to carry out heavy cleaning.

52     DW3 was the defendant’s representative who had engaged Johnson. He explained that testing had been done by the plaintiff for all the underground pipes before the haunching and backfilling could take place[^40]. This process had been witnessed by all three parties _ie_ Forvis, the resident technical officer on behalf of the owner and the plaintiff’s supervisor (PW3) on his behalf.

53     At the point when the pipes were laid in September 2015, DW3 testified that there were no issues with any of the underground pipes. In December 2015, Johnson was appointed to do the second testing and leakage was found in four out of 28 sections of the sanitary pipes. By right, the plaintiff should have been given the opportunity to rectify the defects at that stage. However, due to payment issues, he was compelled by DW1 to terminate the plaintiff’s contract even though the plaintiff was not in breach. Due to time pressure, the strategy employed by the defendant, as dictated by DW1, was to find fault with the plaintiff, effect a termination of the contract and appoint a new contractor in its place in order to avoid making payment for works already completed.

54     DW3 agreed during cross-examination that the payments made to Johnson need not have been incurred, and the cost should be borne by the defendant, as seen in the excerpts below[^41]:

> Q    Now, there’s a---if you look at the description it says “survey pressure test in Mandai Road, supply of manpower and equipment.”

> A    Yah.

> Q    Now, would you agree that if the Plaintiff had conducted the test, the 2nd test, there would be no need for this?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And the only reason the Plaintiff did not conduct the 2nd test was because payment was outstanding?

> A    Yes.

> Q    So, if payment was made by the Defendant, the Plaintiff would have conducted the test? And there would have been no issue? No need to incur this invoice of $13,000.

> A    Yes, correct.

> …

> …

> Q    … CIPP, the works by Johnson Pacific which is costed at 21,000?

> A    Yah.

> Q    And then you have, at 360, the heavy cleaning in Mandai?

> A    Okay.

> Q    And the supply of manpower that’s for $2,000?

> A    Mmm.

> Q    For both these matters, I put it to you that the work---these are the works the Plaintiff could have done, but for their termination and since---since Shankh removed the Plaintiff, these costs should be borne by---by the---by the Defendant. Agree, disagree?

> A    Yah. I agree.

55     Given DW3’s concession as the defendant’s project manager, there is no basis for the court to allow the defendant’s claim for the payments made to Johnson. The evidence adduced also does not go to prove that the leakages were caused by the plaintiff’s poor workmanship. While the test conducted by Johnson showed leakage due to cracks in the pipe, DW3 had explained that after the pipe was laid and tested, there was a lot of heavy building activities such as piling and road works that could have caused the pipe joints to be dislodged and the pipe to crack[^42].

#### MainWell Engineering & Services

56     According to DW1, after Johnson had conducted the tests and found multiple leaks, the defendant had requested the plaintiff to submit method statements for rectification of the damaged pipes by 7 December and 9 December 2015 but it failed to do so. The defendant then engaged MainWell Engineering & Services (“MainWell”) to carry out leak detection and repair works. The defendant paid MainWell $11,040 for its services (see \[45 (f)\].

57     DW3 testified that after Johnson had done the underground pressure test which showed that the pipes were leaking, as the roadworks had already been completed, the defendant needed to pinpoint the location of the leaks before rectification works could be done. MainWell was engaged as the specialist to locate the leakage spots and do rectifications.

58     During cross-examination, DW3 agreed that had the plaintiff’s contract not been terminated and its workers chased off the site, it could have done the job that MainWell was engaged to perform. As for the detection of the leak, from DW3’s account of how the initial testing of the underground pipes had been done and passed, there is no clear evidence that the leaks were caused by the plaintiff’s defective workmanship.

59     Since the Works Order expressly contemplated a defects liability period, and the plaintiff was not in breach of contract at the material time as attested to be DW3, there is no basis to allow the defendant’s claim for the sum paid to MainWell.

#### FT Plumbing Construction Pte Ltd

60     The defendant claimed that it had appointed FT Plumbing Construction Pte Ltd (“FT Plumbing”) to complete the outstanding plumbing works and to rectify the plaintiff’s defective works. The defendant paid FT Plumbing on two invoices for $23,712.37 and $9,638.56 (see \[45 (e) and fe)\].

61     Similar to MainWell, it was conceded by DW3 that the works carried out by FT Plumbing under its Tax Invoice No. 000455 for $$23,712.27 could have been done by the plaintiff had the contract not been terminated by the defendant and its workers chased off the site. As for the second invoice for $9,638.56, this was for work done at the cookhouse which was not part of the plaintiff’s scope of works in the Works Order. DW3 had described the claim as “not valid”[^43].

#### Sai Veera Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd

62     The defendant claimed that Sai Veera Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd (“Sai Veera”) had been engaged to rectify defective works carried out by the plaintiff at the handicap toilets, cookhouse and overflow pipe. Three invoices were rendered by Sai Veera.

63     In cross-examination, DW3 testified that the first invoice dated 2 January 2016 for $1,810 was for additional works that Forvis had given to the defendant which were executed by Sai Veera. It had nothing to do with the plaintiff[^44]. The invoice showed that it was in fact for electrical works.

64     As for the invoices for the work carried out in the handicap toilet, not all the items were under the plaintiff’s scope of work. One of the items related to firefighting equipment[^45]. The other items of work could easily have been completed by the plaintiff. These invoices should not be visited upon the plaintiff since it was the defendant who had terminated the contract[^46] when the plaintiff was not in breach.

### Whether the defendant is entitled to impose back-charges and other sums against the plaintiff

65     The defendant’s counterclaim had further pleaded two items of cost omissions as particulars of loss and damage due to the plaintiff’s failure to complete the works and /or to carry out the works in a proper manner. These were: (1) pre-handing over cleaning of $535 and (2) manhole shoring of $15,000. There is no explanation as to the basis of these claims being mounted against the plaintiff.

66     Since the defendant had terminated the contract and effectively prevented the plaintiff from completing the scope of works including handing over and defects rectification, the claim for pre-handing over cleaning appears to be without any foundation. As for manhole shoring, there is no evidence adduced as to how and why the sum of $15,000 has to be borne by the plaintiff.

67     The defendant had also counterclaimed the sum of $300 from the plaintiff for “7th month prayer”[^47]. It is unclear what the defendant’s cause of action is as regards this claim. No evidence was furnished in DW1’s AEIC that the plaintiff had requested the defendant to make payment of this sum on its behalf.

68     On the back-charges for missing sanitary ware, there is no evidence that the plaintiff was at fault and should therefore have to bear the cost of the missing items. The defendant had claimed the sum of $4,253.38 as missing sanitary ware which were delivered to the site and were in the plaintiff’s custody at all material times.

69     The figure of $4,253.38 is not supported by the documents exhibited in DW1’s AEIC at Tab 6. There is also no evidence that the missing sanitary ware were in the plaintiff’s custody. From the explanation given by DW3, it appeared that Forvis’s site representative, one Karthik, and PW3 were each trying to lay blame on the other party[^48]. The sanitary ware was in the store maintained by Forvis and it was the responsibility of Forvis and the defendant to issue the items to the plaintiff. Once the items were drawn from the store, it would then be the responsibility of the plaintiff if the items were lost. However, the missing sanitary items which are the subject of the back-charge were found missing from the store. As such, the claim made against the plaintiff to bear this back-charge is spurious.

70     The final item of the defendant’s counterclaim is the sum of $10,000 which it alleges the plaintiff had wrongly claimed for the works completed by Sing Teck[^49]. DW1 asserted in his AEIC that the plaintiff had claimed in PC-01 for works which had substantially been completed by Sing Teck. After the plaintiff started work in mid-August 2015, it had sent PC-01 dated 31 August 2015 for work done under four items of the Works Order. Two of these items for installation works were claimed at 100%, the third was at 70% and the fourth at 50%[^50]. The defendant contended that the plaintiff could not have completed the quantity of work claimed within a span of two weeks. The defendant claimed that it is entitled to set-off the sum of $10,000 from the payment made to the plaintiff under PC-01 for Sing Teck’s works.

71     The evidence from DW3 contradicts DW1’s claim. In cross-examination, DW3 confirmed that the works awarded to the plaintiff under the Works Order had nothing to do with what Sing Teck had previously done. There was no overlap in the works performed by the two entities[^51].

72     In any case, the defendant’s attempt to claw back the payment made to the plaintiff under PC-01 is totally without merit given that PC-01 had been evaluated by DW3 at the material time. After PC-01 was submitted, DW3 had asked for drawings and photographs before certifying the claim[^52]. Out of the total claim of $27,100, DW3 had verified the value of the works done in the sum of $16,205[^53]. Given that the works done had been properly verified by DW3, the claim made by DW1 is again a spurious one.

73     Having examined the evidence adduced in relation to each head of the defendant’s counterclaim, I find that the defendant has failed to discharge its burden of proof.

## Conclusion

74     In the result, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has proven its claim against the other. The plaintiff’s claim and the defendant’s counterclaim are accordingly dismissed.

75     Each party is to bear its own costs given that neither party has succeeded in its claim. There will be liberty to apply should there be any issue that needs the court’s determination in relation to costs.
