\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9316/2019/01.\]

4 February 2020

### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

The accused, male, 20 years old, pleaded guilty to twenty-nine counts, of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)(“PC”) and one count of engaging in a conspiracy with another to cheat M1 Limited, a telecommunications service provider, which offence is punishable under section 420 read with section 109 of the PC.

2       Two hundred remaining charges were taken into consideration (“TIC”). They included one-hundred and eighty-eight charges of cheating[^1], one count of theft in dwelling[^2], three counts of theft[^3], four counts of being in unlawful possession of Singapore National Registration Identification (“NRIC”) Cards belonging to four respective persons[^4], one count of house trespass with intention to commit theft[^5], one count of assisting in a public lottery[^6], one count of voluntarily causing hurt[^7] and one count of being in fraudulent possession of an item, which was reasonably suspected to be stolen[^8].

3       After the accused pleaded guilty to the above charges, I called for both the probation and reformative training suitability reports (namely, “probation report” and “RT report” respectively). The accused was found suitable for both probation and reformative training. He was further recommended to undergo level 2 intensity of rehabilitation[^9] in the reformative training centre (“RTC”).

4       On 4 December 2019, the accused was sentenced to reformative training for the minimum detention period of 12 months. He filed a Notice of Appeal on the same day. An application to stay the sentence of reformative training was allowed and bail pending the appeal has been furnished. The accused is currently on bail.

## Charges

5       For ease of reference, the accused was convicted on the following thirty charges:

## Summary of Facts

6       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts pertaining to the above charges, without qualification. The salient points are as follows:

> Cheating (s. 420 PC)

> _“Telco scam”_

> (a)    Sometime on or before June 2017, the accused conceived of a plan to cheat multiple victims. The plan was for the victims to obtain new mobile phones by signing up new mobile subscription plans with different telecommunication (“Telco”) companies, and to hand the said mobile phones along with their SIM cards, to the accused, who would deceive his victims (in some cases) into believing that they would receive a commission for each mobile phone they delivered to him. He also deceived the victims into believing that he would pay the monthly bills and termination fees for the said subscriptions on their behalf when he had no intention to do so.

> (b)    The accused posted multiple advertisements on Facebook as well as on online marketplace platform “Carousell”, by using various accounts, claiming that he could help others earn fast cash. Interested parties would contact the accused who would in turn explain to them the plan in detail. The accused would meet up with the victims and accompany them to various mobile phone shops where he would provide them with cash required for any administrative fees as well as for the purchase of the new mobile devices that they were eligible to buy after signing up for the new mobile lines under their names. The purchased mobile devices together with the SIM cards would thereafter be handed over to the accused who, would in turn, give the victims (for some cases) a commission fee ranging from $200 to $300 for each mobile device they handed over to him.

> (c)    The accused also offered the victims a referral fee ranging from $150 to $200 for each friend they could refer to the accused, and who would similarly subscribe to new mobile plans, as well as purchase and deliver the mobile devices they received in the process to the accused.

> (d) After receiving the new mobile devices from the victims, the accused sold them online or through second-hand mobile phone shops. The proceeds of sale which the accused received were then used for his own personal use, which also included funding his gambling addiction.

> _“Carousell scam”_

> (e)    Sometime on or about May 2017, the accused conceived of a plan to cheat multiple victims via Carousell by deceiving them into believing that he was selling various concert tickets, when he did not in fact have such tickets to sell.

> (f)    In relation to the three proceeded charges, the accused did cheat by deceiving the three victims into believing that they were purchasing legitimate concert tickets, a fact which he knew to be false and by such manner of deception, he dishonestly induced them to deliver a total amount of $3,100 to him.

> “_Replacement phone scam_”

> (g)    The victim is New Asurion Singapore Pte Ltd, a company which provides various protection services for Singtel, M1 Limited and Starhub (“the Telcos”). These phone protection services include the provision of replacement phones to the customer of the Telcos.

> (h)    Under the victim’s phone replacement policy, a customer of the Telcos may be eligible for a replacement phone if they had originally signed up for the victim’s phone protection services. These eligible customers may request for a replacement phone in the event that their phone was lost, misplaced or stolen.

> (i)    On 31 August 2017, the accused cheated one Mustafa bin Riduan (“Mustafa”) into believing that he would receive a commission after signing up for mobile plans on the accused’s behalf. Thereafter, Mustafa obtained two mobile phones, which he gave to the accused.

> (j)    Sometime around September to October 2017, the accused contacted the victim through their phone replacement hotline informing them that he had lost his mobile phone and needed a replacement phone. The accused provided, amongst other things, Mustafa’s mobile number and identity card number for verification.

> (k)    The accused then called Mustafa informing him that a courier would be delivering a new mobile phone to his house. He explained to Mustafa that he had reported to the victim that the mobile phone which Mustafa had earlier transferred to him was lost. The accused then instructed Mustafa to collect the said replacement phone on his behalf and to subsequently pass the said phone to him.

> (l)    Mustafa did as he was instructed, and subsequently delivered the replacement phone to the accused later that day.

> (m)    The victim would not have provided the replacement mobile phone valued at $1,418, to the accused had it known that the accused had not in fact lost his mobile phone, or intended to sell the replacement phone.

> Conspiracy to commit cheating (s. 420 r/w s. 109 PC)

> (n)    The victim is M1 Limited and the accomplice is one Kuah Yi Jie Kenneth, an 18-year old.

> (o)    On 16 September 2016, and in pursuance of the conspiracy that the accused and the accomplice was engaged in, the accomplice deceived an employee of M1 Limited into believing that he was one “Tan Zhi Hong Jasper” and that he had intended to subscribe to a mobile services plan. The identity card of “Tan Zhi Hong Jasper” was used by the accomplice to apply for a mobile plan with the said victim.

> (p)    Thereafter, the victim delivered an electronic device valued at $1,238 to the accomplice, who in turn handed the said electronic device to the accused, who subsequently sold the same.

> (q)    The amount involved for the proceeded charges was $72,402 whereas the total amount involved for all the charges (including the TIC charges) was $231,699. The accused had used the proceeds of sale for his own personal expenses including funding his gambling addiction. To date, the accused has yet to make any restitution.

## Antecedents

7       The accused is a first offender.

## Prosecution’s submissions

8       The prosecution objected to the court calling for the probation report but did not object to the RT report to be called in view of the numerous charges as well as the substantial value of the total amount involved in the charges.

## Mitigation

9       The accused is 20 years old and was discharged from National Service a few months prior to taking the plea of guilt, due to his medical condition (namely, depression). He had previously sought treatment at the National Addiction Management Services (“NAMS”) in the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for his gambling addiction sometime in 2018 till early 2019. He had resorted to committing the cheating offences to pay his gambling debts when he incurred losses due to his excessive gambling.

10     The accused has since pleaded guilty to the offences and only realised the gravity of his actions after he was arrested by the police and charged in court for the current offences.

11     According to the defence’s written mitigation, the accused’s father is a bankrupt and his mother is a housewife. The accused has since started working as a Grabfood delivery assistant to support himself and his family pending the disposition of the case. It was thus submitted that given the accused’s young age as well as the fact that he is amenable to reform, rehabilitation would be the dominant sentencing consideration, in which case, both the RT and probation reports ought to be called for.

## Pre-sentence reports

12     The accused is a first and young offender where probation and reformative training are rehabilitative sentencing options for the court’s consideration. I called for both the probation and RT reports, where the accused was found suitable for both probation and reformative training.

## Prosecution’s Further Submissions

13     The prosecution submitted for reformative training to be imposed, in view of the following aggravating factors:

> a)     The accused had been convicted of thirty cheating offences involving multiple victims as well as a substantial amount of over $230,000;

> b)     The punishment prescribed for the cheating offences carry a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 10 years;

> c)     Even where rehabilitation remains the primary sentencing consideration, deterrence ought to feature strongly in the sentence to be imposed given the sheer number of victims, the total amount involved as well as the likely custodial sentence of an imprisonment term, spanning over a few years, had the accused been sentenced as an adult offender;

> d)     The accused had also re-offended while he was on police bail and had further defaulted in his follow-up appointments with IMH in relation to his gambling disorder;

> e)     There were also concerns on the parents’ lack of firm boundaries and their ability to effectively supervise the accused given that his father has flexible working hours and is subject to overseas assignments on an ad hoc basis. In fact, the accused only saw his father once a month in the year leading up to the offences.

> f)     The accused and his father were also uncontactable by the Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist for purposes of preparing the RT report after the initial interview. Further, the accused was unable to recall his mother’s contact details, suggesting the environment that the accused would be in, should he be placed on probation. In the RT report, the accused’s narrative further show that he received limited support from his parents.

## Further Mitigation

14     The accused’s counsel submitted for a sentence of probation given that the accused is young and a first offender, for which rehabilitation would be the dominant sentencing consideration. Whilst the aggravating factors highlighted by the prosecution were not disputed, the defence submitted that imposing a sentence of probation for 30 months with the added recommended conditions would not be a mere slap on the wrist. The accused would have to comply with amongst other conditions, the need to adhere to time restrictions, be placed on electronic monitoring and undergo counselling at the IMH for his gambling disorder. Further, his movements would be further restricted by prohibiting him from visiting certain areas in Geylang (where illegal gambling dens are located).

15     The parents were also willing to sign the bond and undertake to co-operate with the PO to assist in the accused’s rehabilitation should he be sentenced to probation. This was notwithstanding the fact that the accused and his father did not share a close relationship previously as stated in the pre-sentence reports. Given the accused’s current strong familial support and the fact that he is also willing to undergo counselling in IMH to deal with his gambling addiction, the court was thus urged to consider imposing a sentence of probation.

## Decision of the court

### Sentencing considerations in relation to a young offender

16     The two-stage approach for sentencing youthful offenders is well established (see _PP v A Karthik_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 202</span> (“_A Karthik_”) at \[64\], citing _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“_Boaz Koh_”) at \[28\]) where Sundaresh Menon CJ set out the approach as follows:

> …At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the second stage of the inquiry, which is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.

17     As a starting point, rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration in determining the appropriate sentence for a young offender aged 21 years and below (see _PP v Lim Chee Yin Jordan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 46</span> (“_Jordan Lim_”) at \[30\] citing _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ \[1998\] 3 SLR (R) 439 (“_Maurice Mok”_) at \[21\]).

18     In _A Karthik’s_ case at \[65\] – \[67\], Sundaresh Menon CJ laid down the relevant sentencing approach to be undertaken. At the first stage, the court is thus concerned with the threshold question of whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix. While rehabilitation is presumptively the dominant consideration when sentencing youthful offenders, its primacy may be diminished by the circumstances of the case or even eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution. This tends to be the position where: (a) the offence is serious; (b) the harm caused is severe; (c) the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; and/or (d) the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable do not exist (_Boaz Koh_ at \[30\]). In respect of the last factor, Chan Seng Onn J suggested in _Muhammad Zuhairie Adely bin Zulkifli v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 697</span> (“_Zuhairie_”) at \[25\] that whether or not the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options viable exist may also be affected by other considerations noted by Rajah JA in _PP v Mohamed Al Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR 449</span> (“_Al Ansari_”) at \[67\], namely: (a) the nature of the rehabilitation best suited for the offender; (b) the availability of familial support for the offender’s rehabilitative efforts; and (c) any other special reasons or need for rehabilitation.

19     This approach to the evaluation of whether there exist conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options viable is broadly similar to the assessment undertaken by Chao JA in _Leon Russel Francis v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 651</span> (“_Leon Russel Francis_”) of _whether the individual offender’s capacity for rehabilitation is demonstrably high_ so as to outweigh the concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against probation (at \[14\], cited at _Praveen s/o Krishnan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1300</span> (“_Praveen Krishnan_” at \[29\]). The rehabilitative potential of a young offender has been described as “one of the key considerations” in the court’s endeavour to strike the right balance between deterrence and rehabilitation when sentencing such on offender: _Zuhairie_ at \[30\]. The factors relevant to the assessment in this regard include the following (_Leon Russel Francis_ at \[15\]; _Praveen Krishnan_ at \[30\]):

> (a)     the strength of familial support and the degree of supervision provided by the offender’s family for his rehabilitation;

> (b)     the frequency and intensity of the offender’s wrongful activities;

> (c)     the genuineness of remorse demonstrated by the offender; and

> (d)     the presence of risk factors such as negative peers or bad habits.

20     At the second stage of the _Boaz Koh_ framework, the court must select the appropriate sentence in view of the primary sentencing considerations identified and prioritised at the first stage. Where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration, probation would be one of the typical options at the court’s disposal, given that probation places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation: _Boaz Koh_ at \[35\]. In contrast, where there is a need for both deterrence and rehabilitation, reformative training may be the most suitable sentence, given that it offers the court a useful middle ground between sending the offender to prison and meeting the desire to rehabilitate a young offender: _Boaz Koh_ at \[38\] –\[39\] and _Al-Ansari_ at \[57\]-\[58\].

21     With the above sentencing principles in mind, I now turn to the factual matrix of the present case.

#### Seriousness of the offences

22     The offences committed by the accused are serious as evident in the punishments prescribed for the offences of cheating for which the prescribed punishment is a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 10 years as well as a discretionary fine (for each charge).

#### Culpability of the accused

23     The involvement of the accused in the cheating offences spanned over more than a year, namely, from sometime in 2016 to 2017. It was evident that the cheating offences as well as the other TIC charges which included theft, possession of another’s NRIC without lawful authority or excuse, house trespass with intention to commit theft, assisting in carrying on of a public lottery, fraudulent possession of property, were committed in order to ultimately fund his gambling addiction. He had clearly used all illegal means to either steal cash, or use stolen NRICs purchased or deceive victims in an elaborate plan to subscribe to mobile service plans and to ultimately obtain the new mobile phones, which were subsequently sold and the proceeds of sale used to reduce his gambling debts. He had even worked for an illegal gambling operator to similarly earn money to pay his gambling debts. He was also involved in a dispute with the victim whom he had intended to obtain a loan, which resulted in a physical fight and the accused committing the offence of voluntarily causing hurt[^10].

24     The commission of the above offences had also coincided with the frequency of his gambling activities which increased in 2016 and 2017 where he would gamble almost daily, resulting in mounting losses of up to a few thousand dollars per day. In order to recoup his losses, the accused committed the current offences and had used the money illegally obtained to either gamble in the illegal gambling dens in Geylang or online.

25     It was undisputed that the offences committed were premeditated and involved a high degree of planning where victims were lured by the commissions dangled by the accused to induce them to sign up the mobile services plans which also involved the purchase of mobile phones, with his promise that he would incur the monthly charges as well as termination fees when he did not intend to do so, as his ultimate aim was to sell these mobile phones to pay his gambling debts which were clearly mounting.

26     The total amount involved for all the charges was a staggering amount of about $232,000, which the accused had benefited from the proceeds of sale (of the mobile phones and electronic devices), even after taking into account the commission or referral fees incurred by the accused. Furthermore, there were many victims involved for the cheating offences, in particular, twenty-four victims in relation to the proceeded charges and two hundred and thirty-three for the remaining charges. It is also noteworthy that there has been no restitution to date made by the accused.

27     I was further concerned of the fact that the accused had justified his offending behaviour and making light of it that it was a ‘fun and quick’ way to finance his gambling debts, alcohol use and other expenses. He had also rationalised that since he was not charged or given any warning for the offences he had committed in 2016, he was further emboldened to commit the offences in 2017 without facing any legal consequences[^11].

#### Recalcitrant offender

28     Whilst it is notable that the accused had completed the Guidance Programme (“GP”) on 20 February 2015 for the offence of committing theft of mobile phones in 2014, he had subsequently committed theft in September 2015 ‘out of thrill’ and also for his personal expenses[^12].

29     By his own admission, the accused had committed offences in 2015 and had continued to re-offend in 2016 and 2017. In fact, the accused had committed the offences in 2016 while he was on police bail and continued to gamble and resorted to committing the cheating offences to recoup his losses[^13].

30     Whilst the accused had completed GP successfully, the observations made by Fei Yue Community Services are noteworthy in that the accused had expressed regret for a theft offence (committed in 2014) that yielded little returns and ‘would rather focus on online activities that yielded higher returns of thousands of dollars[^14]’. He was further assessed to hold ‘pro-criminal attitudes, tendency towards unlawful activities, and lack of guilt towards offences that he deemed minor[^15]’. These observations were rather telling as the accused’s offending behaviour escalated despite having undergone interventions under the GP in 2014/2015, as he had in fact, continued to re-offend repeatedly in subsequent years in 2016 and 2017. The accused had clearly not internalised the lessons learnt under the GP, given the similar observations made by the Probation Officer, Mr Judin Lopez (“PO”), where he states in the probation report, that the accused’s ‘continued offending while on police bail despite prior arrests and intervention reflects his high risk-taking behaviour, blatant disregard for the law and failure to internalise the lessons learnt[^16]’.

#### Availability of familial support

31     Whilst the accused’s parents are willing to co-operate with the PO to assist the accused in his rehabilitation as well as play a more active role in supervising the accused and improving his habits and lifestyle, a closer examination of both the probation and RT reports reveal several concerns that I have in regard to the parents’ ability to effectively supervise the accused.

32     First, notwithstanding that the accused’s parents are concerned and share a purported close relationship with the accused as noted by the PO[^17], the accused, however, appears to also receive limited support from them. The accused’s father shared a distant relationship with the accused as his father worked mostly overseas since he was young and he only saw his father about once a month in the year leading up to his offences[^18]. This was also consistent in the probation report where the father shared that his attention to family matters were lacking since 2014 when his business suffered a downturn and was under financial strain. Furthermore, the accused did not turn to his parents for financial support and they were even unaware of his gambling habits and cheating offences until he was arrested.

33     Second, the parents were noted by his secondary school to be ‘unable to exert control’ over the accused, who was suspended indefinitely in 2015, for being a negative influence over his peers. In 2013, the accused was caught for being in possession of two packets of cigarettes during a camp and had influenced his friend to keep them on his behalf. Furthermore, he was described by the school as ‘unresponsive, irresponsible, impolite, dishonest, unhelpful, inattentive, lazy and disrespectful’[^19].

34     Third, the accused’s parents were observed by the caseworker from Fei Yue Community Services (where the accused had undergone the GP) to also fail to exert control over the accused. Whilst they were cooperative, they did not however, acknowledge the accused’s wrongdoings then, and did not have a consistent approach towards the accused’s discipline. The parents were also assessed to have ‘inappropriate boundaries and guidelines in their inconsistent parenting’. In particular, the mother, who permitted and facilitated the accused’s online trading activities, would punish the accused by selling his stocks to incur losses as a means of punishment meted out whenever she learned of his misconduct in school. Instead of clarifying with the accused of his misbehaviours, the mother was quick to react in anger in meting out such inappropriate punishments as she was aware that the accused placed great importance to money[^20].

35     Despite the repeated arrests and completion of GP, the accused continued to re-offend, which was suggestive of the parents’ inability to effectively supervise as well as influence him to be constructively engaged. He not only did not attend school since 2015, his late nights persisted where he would return home in the wee hours of the morning at 4am on several occasions. Yet these activities were left unmonitored by his parents who neither enquired about his late nights[^21].

36     Prior to his police arrest in 2017, the accused’s parents did not appear to be aware of his association with negative peers as he continued to meet his former school peers, some of whom were his accomplices and there was no change in his recreational activities. Despite not working in 2017, he continued to keep late nights, which did not appear to be met with any objections from his parents[^22].

#### Negative peers

37     The accused was introduced by an ex-schoolmate to an illegal gambling den in Geylang in 2016 and where he gambled almost daily. As noted in the RT report, the accused’s association with one negative peer contributed to his offending as they would encourage each other to commit more cheating offences. They would meet four to five times a week in 2016 to 2017 to gamble together[^23]. This friend would also encourage the accused to continue gambling by committing offences online[^24].

38     While the accused also reported to have six or seven positive peers whom he interacted with weekly prior to his arrest, nonetheless, he persisted in committing the offences despite their advice[^25]. In fact, even after the completion of the GP in February 2015, the accused associated with negative peers and committed the offence of theft in September 2015 for his personal gain.

39     As noted above, the accused’s introduction into illegal gambling by a negative peer, was clearly the root of his problem, precipitating the commission of the current offences. It is also undisputed that the accused, himself, was in fact, a negative peer whom the school had wanted to minimise his interactions with the other students, and it was for this reason that he was suspended from school in 2015. The school had in fact, given feedback that whilst there were marked improvements after the commencement of the GP, his teachers were nonetheless concerned of the adverse influence he had over his peers. They had in fact described the accused as displaying ‘an attitude of unrepentance to his misconduct(s) (sic) and was manipulative’. He was further suspected to be the main perpetrator when he commits offences with his peers[^26].

#### Unhealthy habits

40     The accused’s offending behaviour was evidently a result of his gambling addiction which spiralled out of control. Whilst there was no evidence of the accused drinking any alcohol when he committed the current offences, it was nonetheless, a cause of concern as the accused had not only started drinking alcohol at the age of 15, he had continued to drink hard liquor weekly at the age of 18. Furthermore, the money he earned from his cheating offences were also utilized to finance his drinking habit as well[^27].

41     Even after the accused was first charged in court on 14 October 2017, the accused continued his gambling activities and only stopped sometime in February[^28] or March 2019[^29].

42     Whilst the accused had sought help at the Addiction Medicine clinic at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) on 17 April 2018, and was diagnosed with suffering from gambling disorder, the accused appeared to have a lack of insight into his gambling problem and was only keen to be treated for his depressed mood. He had in fact failed to attend counselling for his gambling disorder[^30]. He was last seen by the IMH psychiatrist, Dr Guo Song, in February 2019 and still reported frequent gambling and losing about $1,000 a month. Since then, there have been no updates that the accused had continued his counselling to deal with gambling issues. I found the accused’s reasons for his failure to attend the sessions, namely, that he did not think he was benefiting from the counsellor reiterating the same advice, as a convenient excuse, and instead, someone who was unwilling to deal with the underlying root cause of his offending behaviour.

#### Lack of genuine remorse

43     There was also a lack of genuine remorse by the accused repeatedly choosing to re-offend despite the previous police arrests in 2014 for theft of mobile phones and thereafter for theft in September 2015, just seven months after completing the GP in February 2015. This was followed by the litany of property related and cheating offences committed in 2016 and 2017, some of which were committed while he was on police bail as well.

#### Selection of the appropriate sentence

44     As observed in the RT report[^31], the accused’s frequent gambling, lack of stable employment, financial problems and unconstructive use of his leisure time and negative peer association in the year leading up to his offences, contributed to the accused’s offending behaviour.

45     Whilst the accused has expressed his willingness to attend programmes to address his risks, undergo treatment and take medication to improve his mental health as well as improve his employable skills to increase greater job prospects, I was nonetheless, concerned of the accused’s lack of insight into his gambling problem as well as his lack of genuine willingness to undergo counselling to address his gambling addiction (until recently as he had defaulted on his appointments previously), his lack of genuine remorse and his parents’ inability to effectively supervise him as highlighted above.

46     Given the multiple offences committed by the accused even if he has no prior convictions, I was also minded to be slow in regarding the accused as a first offender (see _PP v Chen Weixiong Jerriek_ v PP \[2003\] 2 SLR (R) 334 at \[17\]) (“_Chen Weixiong Jerriek_”).

47     I was thus of the view that the accused’s capacity to rehabilitate in the community was not demonstrably high or his personal circumstances so exceptional, that rehabilitation would retain primacy in the court’s deliberation, in imposing probation instead of reformative training. Given my concerns as highlighted above as well as the seriousness of the offences and the accused’s blatant disregard of the law in choosing to re-offend repeatedly, a measure of deterrence within the overarching focus on rehabilitation was necessary given the accused’s young age. There must also be a strong message sent to the accused and any like-minded youthful offenders that such repeated offending, would not be tolerated.

48     The accused and his father were further uncontactable by the Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist in preparing the RT report after the interview to corroborate with additional sources of information, and in the absence of any plausible explanation from either the accused or his father as to why they remained uncontactable, I was further concerned if they would co-operate with the authorities should rehabilitation take place in the community.

49     For the reasons highlighted above, a sentence of reformative training with level 2 intensity of rehabilitation, would thus be the appropriate sentence as it would represent a right balance between the twin goals of rehabilitation and deterrence (see _Al Ansari_ as above).

_The accused was sentenced to undergo reformative training for a minimum of 12 months’ detention in a reformative training centre._
