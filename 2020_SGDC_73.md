Contempt of Court – Civil Contempt

31 March 2020

### District Judge Koh Jiaying:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant are companies carrying on the business of providing remittance services, located within People’s Park Complex. The Plaintiff has outlets at unit numbers #02-100, #02-105, #02-106, #02-K90 and K91 and #03-14.[^1] The 1st Defendant operates from unit #01-36 and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are its employees.[^2]

2       The Plaintiff’s pleaded case, as set out in the Statement of Claim filed on 3 November 2017, was that the 1st to 3rd Defendants unlawfully conspired to injure the Plaintiff by unlawful means, namely by harassing the Plaintiff’s employees and that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (whether as individuals or as the 1st Defendant’s officers, agents and/or employees) performed acts of harassment against the Plaintiff’s employees.[^3] The 1st to 3rd Defendants denied the claim, and averred, among other things, that the 1st Defendant’s employees had committed various acts of harassment, and/or intimidation and that Mr Jed Huang, the Chief Executive Officer of the Plaintiff, had attempted to procure the 1st Defendant to agree to an unlawful price-fixing arrangement with the Plaintiff.[^4]

3       On 3 July 2018, the Plaintiff and the 1st to 3rd Defendants entered into a consent judgment (“Consent Judgment”).[^5] The full terms of the Consent Judgment are set out below:

> “_By consent, it is this day adjudged that_

> _1_.     _The Plaintiff, by itself or through its officer(s), employees(s) and/or agent (s), shall be restrained from performing acts or communicating words, which a reasonable person would know to be threatening, abusive, harassing, intimidating and/or insulting towards the 1st, 2nd and/or 3rd Defendants, including their officer(s), employee(s) and/or agent(s);_

> _2_.     _The Plaintiff, by itself or through its officer(s), employee(s) and/or agent(s), shall be restrained from going to the 1st, 2nd and/or 3rd Defendants (sic) premises to solicit for business;_

> _3_.     _The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants, by themselves individually or through its officer(s), employee(s) and/or agent(s), shall be restrained from performing acts or communicating words, which a reasonable person would know to be threatening, abusive, harassing, intimidating and/or insulting towards the Plaintiff, including their officer(s), employee(s) and/or agent(s); and_

> _4_.     _The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants, by themselves individually or through its officer(s), employee(s) and/or agent(s), by itself or through its officer(s), employee(s) and/or agent(s), shall be restrained from going to the Plaintiff’s premises to solicit for business.”_

4       On 10 May 2019, the Plaintiff was granted leave of court to apply for an order of committal against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants for their failure, neglect and/or refusal to comply with paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment. On 23 May 2019, the Plaintiff filed the present application seeking an order of committal against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (“the Defendants”).

5       The Defendants’ position is as follows:

> (a)     The Consent Judgment has not been endorsed with a penal notice as required pursuant to Order 45 r 7(4) of the Rules of Court. The Consent Judgment was recorded pursuant to a settlement agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st to 3rd Defendants (“Settlement Agreement”), which provided (in Clause 8) that any future dispute arising between the parties shall be submitted for mediation and parties may proceed to resolve the dispute in court and/or through the law enforcement agencies if mediation fails (“Mediation Clause”). The 2nd and 3rd Defendants did not receive any request or notification of mediation. Accordingly, the Court should not exercise its discretion to enforce the order notwithstanding the absence of a penal notice[^6];

> (b)     There must be at least a reasonable doubt as to whether any and all of the alleged incidents were either contrived or greatly exaggerated by the Plaintiff and their witnesses.[^7]

## Absence of Penal Notice

6       In respect of the issue of the penal notice, the Defendants submit that the Settlement Agreement envisaging a different recourse for any breaches (i.e. mediation) should be taken into consideration.[^8]

7       The Plaintiff, on the other hand, submits that it is just in the circumstances for the Court to exercise its discretion to dispense with personal service and the penal notice as the Defendants clearly had notice of the Consent Judgment and were aware of the terms of the orders, and the Defendants also had the benefit of legal advice and were alive to the consequences of non-compliance. The Plaintiff further submits that there is no dispute arising between the parties “as depicted in Clause 8 of the Settlement Agreement”, the Consent Judgment does not make any mention of parties having to submit to mediation before commencing committal proceedings, and in any event, that the present committal proceedings are not the appropriate forum to raise such procedural objections. According to the Plaintiff, these issues should have been dealt with by the Defendants taking out an application to set aside the leave granted to the Plaintiff to commence committal proceedings under O 32 r 6 and/or to stay the committal proceedings and proceed to mediation.[^9]

8       I do not agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that the present committal proceedings are not the appropriate forum to raise these objections. It is trite law that the threshold for granting leave to apply for an order for committal under O 52 r 2 is that of a _prima facie_ case of contempt. The court then decides at the second stage, after the leave stage, on the substantive merits of the committal application: see _Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1</span> at \[58\][^10]. Given that the issue of the absence of a penal notice would be directly relevant to whether contempt can be established, it would be extremely unfair and in my view, a fundamental breach of justice if the alleged contemnor is precluded from raising such an issue at the second stage of contempt proceedings. The Court is therefore fully entitled at this stage of committal proceedings to consider the Defendants’ objection in respect of the absence of a penal notice.

9       An order of court may not be enforced by an order of committal unless a copy of the order has been served personally on the person required to do or abstain from doing the act in question and there is endorsed on the copy of the order served a penal notice in Form 81 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court.[^11] The Defendants do not dispute that the Consent Judgment was served on the Defendants via their then-solicitors and the Defendants therefore had notice of the same.[^12] The issue is therefore whether the Court should exercise its discretion to enforce the Consent Judgment under Order 45 r 5 by an order of committal notwithstanding the absence of the penal notice. Order 45 r 7(6) provides that “\[a\]n order requiring a person to abstain from doing an act may be enforced under Rule 5 notwithstanding that service of a copy of the order has not been effected in accordance with this Rule if the Court is satisfied that, pending such service, the person against whom or against whose property it is sought to enforce the order has had notice thereof either (a) by being present when the order was made; or (b) by being notified of the terms of the order, whether by telephone, telegram or otherwise.”

10     In _Allport Alfred James v Wong Soon Lan_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 2 SLR(R) 100</span>, the Court of Appeal stated that if the relevant order has been served personally but the copy served does not contain the penal notice, then the service of the order has not been effected in accordance with O 45 r 7. The Court of Appeal exercised its discretion under O 45 r 7(6) to enforce the order as the respondent knew fully well the terms of the order and throughout had the benefit of legal advice, and there could be no excuse for the respondent not understanding the terms of the order.[^13] Similarly in this case, the Defendants knew fully well the terms of the order, especially given that it was a consent judgment, and had the benefit of legal advice. However, the only issue is whether the Mediation Clause would militate against the exercise of my discretion under O 45 r 7(6), because it was clear to parties that non-compliance of the Consent Judgment would not lead to court proceedings (i.e. committal proceedings) due to the Mediation Clause. In this regard, in _Ang Boon Chye and anor v Ang Tin Yong_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 124</span>, the High Court noted that one of the exceptional circumstances in which the defendant can intervene and object to the plaintiffs’ application for leave to apply for an order of committal, is where the plaintiffs had undertaken not to take out committal proceedings.[^14]

11     For completeness, the relevant portion of the Mediation Clause is set out below:

> “8.    …Any future dispute arising between the parties, including but not limited to disputes arising out of or in connection with this Settlement Agreement, such as any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be submitted for mediation. The aggrieved party shall submit a request to the Singapore Mediation Centre for mediation within 21 days of the dispute arising. Such party to the mediation must be represented by a representative who has the authority to negotiate and settle the dispute. Unless agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be appointed by the Singapore Mediation Centre. The mediation shall take place in Singapore in the English language and the parties agree to be bound by any settlement agreement reached. Should the parties fail tor (_sic_) reach a settlement through mediation, then the parties may proceed to resolve the dispute in through (_sic_) the courts and/or the law enforcement agencies of the Republic of Singapore. For avoidance of doubt, the parties shall be deemed to have failed to reach a settlement if either party serves written notice terminating the mediation.”[^15]

12     In my view, it is clear that the subject matter of the committal proceedings would fall within the phrase “any future dispute arising between the parties” in the Mediation Clause. It is also clear from a plain reading of the Mediation Clause that there was only an agreement not to resolve the dispute through the courts if _all_ parties reached a settlement through mediation. This would mean that _all_ parties would have to agree to mediation once the aggrieved party submitted the request to the Singapore Mediation Centre. Given that the Singapore Mediation Centre had informed the Plaintiff that the 1st Defendant would not like to proceed for mediation[^16], the Plaintiff was entitled to resolve the dispute in court by way of committal proceedings. Accordingly, I exercise my discretion under O 45 r 7(6) to allow the enforcement of the Consent Judgment notwithstanding the absence of a penal notice.

## The alleged breaches of the Consent Judgment

13     The Plaintiff alleged, in the Statement under O 52 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court dated 10 January 2019 (“Statement”), that the Defendants breached paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment on the following occasions[^17]:

> (a)     On or around 18 July 2018, at about 3.40 pm, the 2nd Defendant followed Li Zirong, a counter commissioner employed by the Plaintiff, on the 2nd floor of People’s Park Complex, while keeping her handphone pointed at Li Zirong. When Li Zirong took out her own handphone, the 2nd Defendant rushed over to hit her hand. Upon being confronted by Li Zirong, she told Li Zirong “in an aggressive manner and in Chinese” to “not come over here”. This took place despite Li Zirong being visibly pregnant. I will refer to this as the “18 July Incident”.

> (b)     On or around 18 July 2018, at about 5 pm, the 2nd Defendant approached Yang Ying, a customer service officer employed by the Plaintiff, from the rear. She then blocked Yang Ying’s way and called loudly for the 3rd Defendant, saying that she had found one of the Plaintiff’s employees. She then pointed her handphone at Yang Ying and uttered vulgarities at Yang Ying, who asked to be left alone as she was pregnant. Even though the 3rd Defendant pulled the 2nd Defendant back into the 1st Defendant’s premises, the 2nd Defendant rushed out to Yang Ying and verbally threatened to record videos of any of the Plaintiff’s employees who passed by the common area in front of the 1st Defendant’s premises. I will refer to this as the “18 July Yang Ying Incident”.

> (c)     On or around 26 July 2018, at about 10.50 am, the 3rd Defendant collided into Foo Jun Xian, a computer systems operator employed by the Plaintiff, using both his body and suitcase which he was carrying. At that time, Foo Jun Xian was accompanied by 3 other employees, namely Lee Zhi Hong, Liu Yiqiao and Li Zhenhui. I will refer to this as the “26 July Incident”.

> (d)     On or around 2 August 2018, at about 10.30 pm, Wang Meiqin, an operations manager of the Plaintiff, encountered the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. While she was waiting at an entrance to People’s Park Complex, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants came from behind her and proceeded to point their handphones at Wang Meiqin. The 2nd Defendant also loudly accused Wang Meiqin of assaulting her in front of “a Watsons store”. The 3rd Defendant then pushed Wang Meiqin from the back, despite the fact that she was standing on top of a small flight of stairs. The 2nd Defendant also “gave Wang Meiqin the middle finger”. I will refer to this as the “2 August Incident”.

> (e)     On or around 21 September 2018, at about 2.20 pm, while Li Zirong was going up an escalator from the 2nd to the 3rd floor of People’s Park Complex, the 2nd Defendant collided with her. Upon being confronted by Li Zirong, the 2nd Defendant took out her handphone and pointed it at Li Zirong. When Li Zirong responded with “you can record whatever you like”, the 2nd Defendant loudly threatened to beat up Li Zirong. The 3rd Defendant then came up to the 2nd floor, and shielded the 2nd Defendant, who attempted to kick her and also loudly accused Li Zirong of assaulting her. This was despite Li Zirong being visibly pregnant. I will refer to this as the “21 September Incident”.

> The 18 July 2018 Incident and the 18 July 2018 Yang Ying Incident involved the 2nd Defendant. The 26 July 2018 Incident involved the 3rd Defendant, while the 2 August 2018 Incident and 21 September 2018 Incident involved the Defendants.

14     At the hearing of the present application on 19 July 2019, Defendants’ counsel sought leave to cross-examine the Plaintiff’s witnesses. As Plaintiff’s counsel objected to the same, I directed parties to provide submissions on whether cross-examination should be allowed. After reviewing the parties’ submissions and authorities, I allowed cross-examination of the Plaintiffs’ witnesses but to have the same limited to the particular circumstances of the alleged contempt. As the Defendants wished to give oral evidence and were entitled to do so, they were similarly subject to cross-examination.

15     Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed during the hearing that Yang Ying would not be giving evidence in the matter and that it followed that her affidavit would not be used.[^18] It was also stated in the Plaintiff’s Written Submissions dated 20 November 2019, that the Plaintiff would not be relying on the 18 July Yang Ying Incident as the Plaintiff had confirmed during the hearing on 26 September 2019 that the Plaintiff would not be calling Yang Ying to give evidence.[^19]

16     The Defendants’ position is that the Plaintiff has “not proven the case against the Defendants beyond any reasonable doubt on any of the grounds of committal”.[^20]

## Issues to be determined

17     The issues before me were whether the Defendants had breached the Consent Judgment, and if so, the appropriate sentence.

### The law on contempt

18     Section 4(1)(a) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (Act 19 of 2016) (“AJPA”) provides that any person who intentionally disobeys or breaches any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court commits a contempt of court and pursuant to section 12(1)(c) AJPA, where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by the District Court, a person who commits contempt of court shall be liable to be punished with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both.[^21]

19     The relevant legal principles are:

> (a)     The AJPA sought to state and consolidate the law of contempt of court;

> (b)     The basic principles at common law and under the AJPA are similar.

> (c)     The standard of proof for finding contempt of court, whether at common law or under the AJPA, is the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt;

> (d)     The court would adopt a two-step approach in determining whether the alleged contemnor’s conduct amounted to contempt. First, the court would interpret the plain meaning of the language used in the order of court to decide what exactly the order of court required the alleged contemnor to do. Any ambiguity in the language would be resolved in favour of the person who had to comply with the order. Second, the court would determine whether the requirements of the order of court have been fulfilled.

> (e)     The threshold to establish the necessary _mens rea_ for a finding of contempt of court is a low one. It is only necessary for the complainant to show that the relevant conduct of the party alleged to be in breach of the order was intentional and that it knew of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order. This includes knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms. It is not necessary for the complainant to show that the alleged contemnor appreciated that he was breaching the order. The motive or intention of the alleged contemnor and his reasons for disobedience are irrelevant to the issue of liability, and are relevant only to the question of mitigation. The liability is strict in the sense that all that is required to be proved is service of the order and the subsequent omission by the party to comply with the order.

> (see _PT Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 828</span> at \[43\] to \[48\][^22])

20     The Defendants’ counsel submitted that the Plaintiff had referred to and cited excerpts from various cases in order to outline the factors and standards required to establish that a contemnor had “intentionally” disobeyed or breached any judgment or order, and that the Plaintiff’s apparent position was that intention could be inferred from the mere “knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms”. It was further submitted that the finding of knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms alone are not the sole and exhaustive factors to be considered in determining the _mens rea_; it includes the foregoing without excluding any other circumstances that are relevant to the case. [^23]

21     In all fairness to the Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s counsel had not expressly stated the proposition that the knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms are the sole factors to be considered in determining whether the breach of the order was intentional. They had merely pointed out that the Defendants knew about the existence of the Consent Judgment and its material terms.[^24] In considering this issue, it would be helpful to set out the relevant portion of the judgment in _PT Sandipala Arthaputra_:

> “47    The threshold to establish the _mens rea_ for a finding of contempt of court is a low one: _STX Corp_ at \[8\]; _Tan Beow Hiong v Tan Boon Aik_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 870</span> (“_Tan Beow Hiong_”) at \[47\]. It is only necessary for the complainant to show that the relevant conduct of the party alleged to be in breach of the order was _intentional_ and that it _knew_ of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order. This includes knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms: _Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1</span> (“_Mok Kah Hong_”) at \[86\]; _Monex Group_ at \[30\]; _Pertamina Energy_ at \[51\]; _Tan Beow Hiong_ at \[47\].”[^25]

22     In _Mok Kah Hong_, the Court of Appeal stated “…as regards the issue of the requisite _mens rea_ to establish contempt for disobedience of court orders, it is accepted that it is only necessary to prove that the relevant conduct of the party alleged to be in breach of the court order was _intentional_ and that it _knew_ of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order: _Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd_ at \[51\]. This necessarily includes knowledge of the _existence_ of the order and its material terms.”[^26] In _Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 518</span>, the Court of Appeal stated:

> “51    In so far as the party to the court order is concerned, it would appear that it is only necessary to prove that the relevant conduct of the party alleged to be in breach of the court order was intentional and that it knew of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order (including, of course, knowledge of the existence of the order and of all of its material terms (see the English High Court decision of _Re L (A Ward)_ \[1988\] 1 FLR 255 at 259))…”.[^27]

23     It is clear from the above-mentioned cases that the “knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms” are factors that would be _included_ in considering whether the party alleged to be in breach of the order knew of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order.

24     In my view, the necessity to establish whether the breach of the order was intentional is separate, and in this regard, I note the High Court’s observation in _Monex Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd v E-Clearing (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 1169</span> (after stating the complainant must show that the putative contemnor in committing the act complained of or omitting to comply with an order, has the necessary _mens rea_ and this means that it must be established that the conduct complained of was intentional and was carried out with knowledge of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of an order), was that “\[f\]urther, the order must be wilfully or deliberately disobeyed rather than not complied with accidentally or unintentionally”.[^28]

25     In respect of the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, I am guided by the relevant principles laid out by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 2</span>. A summary of these principles is fully laid out in _PP v GCK_ at \[149\][^29] and I need only highlight the following for the present proceedings:

> (a)     The principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt entails that upon considering all the evidence presented by the parties, the evidence suffices to establish beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the charge against the accused person: at \[149(b)\];

> (b)     The term “beyond a reasonable doubt” requires a qualitative appreciation of whether a reasonable doubt has arisen, in the sense of a doubt that is supported by reasons that are logically connected to the evidence. A reasonable doubt is, in other words, a reasoned doubt, and a necessary condition for an acquittal: at \[149(c)\];

> (c)     The principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt can be conceptualised in two ways:

>> (i)       First, a reasonable doubt may arise from within the case mounted by the Prosecution. As part of its own case, the Prosecution must adduce sufficient evidence to establish the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on at least a _prima facie_ basis. Failure to do so may lead to a finding that the Prosecution has failed to mount a case to answer, or to an acquittal. Once the court has identified the flaw internal to the Prosecution’s case, weaknesses in the Defence’s case cannot ordinarily shore up what is lacking in the Prosecution’s case to begin with: at \[149(e)\] and \[149(f)\];

>> (ii)       The second way in which a reasonable doubt may arise is on an assessment of the totality of the evidence, which logically includes the case mounted by the Defence. The evaluative task is not just internal to the Prosecution’s case but also comparative in nature. What the Defence needs to do to bring the Prosecution’s case below the requisite threshold is to point to such evidence as would generate a reasonable doubt. That evidence need not necessarily be raised by the Defence; what matters is that a reasonable doubt arises from the state of the evidence at the close of the trial. Whether a reasonable doubt has arisen must be particularised and duly identified in a manner that is specific to the Prosecution’s case. In order to make a finding that there is a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case, the court must not only articulate the doubt that has arisen in the Prosecution’s case on the totality of the evidence, but also ground that doubt with reference to the evidence: at \[149(g)\] to \[149(j)\].

### What were the Defendants required to do under the Consent Judgment?

26     Paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment makes clear that the Defendants are not allowed to do or say anything which a reasonable person would know to be threatening, abusive, harassing, intimidating and/or insulting towards the Plaintiff’s officers, employees and/or agents.

27     A perusal of the Statement of Claim[^30] and Defence and Counterclaim[^31] shows that the respective pleaded cases in respect of harassment follow the wording of Section 3(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A) (“PHA”) closely. Section 3(1)(a) of the PHA provides:

> “(1) No person shall, with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress to another person, by any means –

>> (a)    use any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or

>> …

> thereby causing that other person or any other person (each referred to for the purposes of this section as the victim) harassment, alarm or distress.”[^32]

28     As the words “threatening”, “abusive”, “harassing” and “insulting” have not been defined in the Consent Judgment, I am of the view that the meaning of “threatening”, “abusive”, “harassing” and insulting should be interpreted by drawing reference from section 3(1)(a) PHA. To this end, I will accord these words their common-sense meaning in my decision, as was the approach taken by the High Court in _Benber Dayao Yu v Jacter Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 316</span>[^33]. In _Benber Dayao Yu_, the High Court accorded the terms “abusive”, “insulting”, “threatening”, “harassment”, “alarm” and “distress” found in ss 3 and 4 of PHA, which are not defined in PHA, their common-sense meaning[^34]. The Court in _Benber Dayao Yu_ referred to _Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 582</span>, wherein it was stated that “\[h\]arassment describes determined conduct which is directed at persons and is calculated to produce discomfort and/or unease and/or distress…_the essence of harassment is not just repetitive conduct but includes prolonged or persistent or sustained conduct_.”[^35] As the word “intimidating” has also not been defined in the Consent Judgment, I similarly accord the term its common-sense meaning.

29     Both parties do not dispute that the above approach should be adopted. Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that although the words “threatening”, “abusive”, “harassing” and “insulting” were not defined in the Consent Judgment, they should be interpreted with reference to section 3(1) of PHA, taking into consideration the factual matrix of each case and specific circumstances surrounding the conduct at hand and according these words their common-sense meaning.[^36] Defendants’ counsel similarly agreed that these words should attract no other meaning than the common sense meaning as has been accorded in law and further submitted that the Court should apply the evaluation process as laid out in Section 3(3) of PHA (i.e. the defence of reasonable conduct) and in Section 12(2)(c) of PHA (i.e. whether it is just and equitable in all the circumstances to make a protection order) to the present case.[^37]

### Whether the requirements of the Consent Judgment were fulfilled

**(a)** **_18 July Incident_**

30     In respect of this incident, Li Zirong (“Li”) stated in her affidavit that she was walking on the 2nd floor of People’s Park Complex and as she passed by the common area in front of the Skechers store, the 2nd Defendant spotted her and took out her handphone and pointed it in Li’s direction. Li initially did not think much of the 2nd Defendant’s actions and “went to stand at a pillar nearby to avoid blocking passerbys (_sic_)”. However, the 2nd Defendant followed her to the pillar. Li “sensed something wrong” and took out her handphone as well. The 2nd Defendant then immediately rushed over and hit her hand, causing her to nearly drop her handphone and said to Li in Mandarin and an aggressive tone to “not come over here”. Li was shocked and fearful for her safety as she had recently become pregnant. Li went to see a doctor and was advised to take a week off in order to avoid further shock and distress. She was also given two days of medical leave from 19 to 20 July 2018.[^38] Li exhibited the medical certificate in her affidavit[^39], which does not state the reason for the medical leave.

31     During cross-examination, Li marked the location where the incident happened on a copy of a photograph showing the 2nd floor area of People’s Park Complex[^40]. Her marking showed that the incident had happened at the common area at the top of the escalators between the 1st and 2nd floors, next to the Skechers shop. She further confirmed during her testimony that the incident happened just in front of the escalator.[^41] Li further stated that she did not know the 2nd Defendant and that she had walked over the pillar because she wanted to double confirm that the 2nd Defendant was indeed taking her photos[^42] and filming her[^43], and that she could not proceed walking to her office as the 2nd Defendant blocked her and took photographs[^44]. Li also claimed that she felt that her safety was in danger and initially stated that she had made a police report about this incident[^45], but later claimed that she could not remember whether the report was made for this incident or the second incident[^46]. When asked why she had only gone to the doctor the day after the alleged incident, Li’s evidence was that she was working at night on that day and by the time she went back, it would be “10 plus or 11” (at night)[^47].

32     The 2nd Defendant stated in her affidavit that the Plaintiff’s employees had this practice of spying on the 1st Defendant’s business from the 2nd level void area overlooking the 1st Defendant’s unit, and sometimes these employees would have their handphone pointed at the 1st Defendant’s premises, obviously taking a photo or recording a video of the 1st Defendant’s operations. The 2nd Defendant further stated that Li may well have been spying on them but that she could not recall the incident and that she “certainly did not come over and hit anyone on the hand or elsewhere”.[^48]

33     It is clear from the above that Li’s evidence on the following material issues was inconsistent:

> (i)     Location of the alleged incident: Li’s evidence on affidavit was that the incident took place as she had passed by the common area in front of the Skechers store but her evidence during cross-examination was that the incident took place at the common area at the top of the escalator between the 1st and 2nd floors.

> (ii)     Reason for Li going to stand at the nearby pillar: Li’s evidence on affidavit was that she had done so to avoid blocking passerbys but her evidence during cross-examination was that she had done so to confirm whether the 2nd Defendant was indeed taking photographs or videos of her.

> (iii)     While the Statement referred to the 2nd Defendant telling Li to “not come over here” only upon the 2nd Defendant being confronted by Li[^49], Li’s affidavit evidence made no mention of Li confronting the 2nd Defendant.

34     Li’s evidence was also unsatisfactory in the following aspects:

> (i)     Li had stated on affidavit that she initially did not think much of her actions and had moved to stand at a pillar nearby to avoid blocking passerbys. However, there would have been no reason for her to stand at the pillar if she truly did not think much of the 2nd Defendant’s actions, especially since walking towards the pillar would be heading in the opposite direction of her office.

> (ii)     Li claimed during cross-examination that she could not proceed to her office as the 2nd Defendant was blocking her. This material fact was not mentioned in the affidavit and based on the above-mentioned photograph of the 2nd floor of People’s Park Complex where the alleged incident happened, there would have been sufficient space for Li to pass or go around the 2nd Defendant. However, there was no evidence that Li had tried to do so. Instead, her evidence was that despite initially not thinking much of the 2nd Defendant’s actions, Li went in the opposite direction of the route to her office to stand at the nearby pillar.

> (iii)     While Li was resolute that she had made a police report for either this incident or the 21 September Incident, no such report was produced. The failure to produce the police report, which would be a contemporaneous document, added doubt as to whether the incident had occurred, and in the manner as set out in paragraph 3(c)(i) of the Statement.

> (iv)     Li’s conduct of returning to work in her office after the alleged incident happened at 3.40 pm, until she finished work at 10 plus or 11 at night, and only seeing a doctor the next day appears to be inconsistent with her claim that she was shocked and fearful for her safety as she had recently become pregnant. There is also no evidence that the medical certificate was issued as a result of any distress suffered by Li due to the alleged incident.

35     Li’s inconsistent and unsatisfactory evidence as highlighted above has created a reasonable doubt within the case mounted by the Plaintiff and I am unable to find that the Plaintiff has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2nd Defendant had breached paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment in respect of the alleged 18 July incident.

**(b)** **_18 July Yang Ying Incident_**

36     As mentioned above at \[15\], Yang Ying did not give evidence at the hearing despite filing an affidavit in support of the application. The 2nd Defendant has stated on affidavit that she has no recollection of any such incident[^50]. In view of the Plaintiff’s confirmation that it would not rely on this incident and Yang Ying’s failure to give evidence at the hearing, I am unable to find that the 2nd Defendant had breached paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment in relation to the alleged 18 July Yang Ying incident.

**(c)** **_26 July Incident_**

37     It is not disputed that on or around 26 July 2018, there was a collision between the 3rd Defendant and Foo Jun Xian. However, the person responsible for causing the collision and whether it was accidental or intentional is disputed. [^51] The area in which the collision took place is shown below. For ease of reference, I will refer to the corridor on the right of the picture (between the staircase and the shopfront) below as “the Corridor”.

![]([2020] SGDC 0073_Image/[2020] SGDC 0073_image1.png)

\[Source: Extract from 3rd Defendant’s affidavit, Bundle of Affidavits, Tab I, p 15\]

38     There were four witnesses who gave evidence for the Plaintiff in relation to the 26 July Inciden, namely Foo Jun Xian, Li Zhenhui, Lee Zhi Hong and Liu Yiqiao. Based on the evidence in their affidavits as well as during cross-examination, they were all going down a staircase from the second to the first floor of People’s Park Complex and were carrying haversacks. A luggage was carried by Liu Yiqiao with the assistance of Foo Jun Xian. Li Zhenhui and Lee Zhi Hong were walking ahead, while Foo Jun Xian followed behind slightly on their right with Liu Yiqiao at the rear. Their evidence was that it was the 3rd Defendant who had collided into Foo Jun Xian.[^52]

39     When asked by the Defendants’ counsel during cross-examination whether the collision could have been accidental, the position of all four witnesses was that this could not have been the case for the following respective reasons:

> (i)     Foo Jun Xian testified that it was impossible because “the road there is very wide” and that for an accidental collision, it would be a slight bump on the shoulders but not with such force, and the luggage was caught in between his legs and the 3rd Defendant pulled it with great force, causing him to lose his balance.[^53] Further, it could not have been an accident if the 3rd Defendant had used such great force to hit people and if it was accidental, the 3rd Defendant could have said sorry[^54];

> (ii)     Lee Zhihong testified that he knew that the collision was not an accident because there was still space on the right for the 3rd Defendant to walk and that for a normal person, “if you see someone in front and there’s space at the side, you will definitely shift”.[^55]

> (iii)     Li Zhenhui testified that he only turned around to look at Junxian when he heard the sound of luggage colliding and in response to the question of how he knew that the collision was an accident, he stated that “I looked at Junxian, Junxian told me he knocked into him,”[^56];

> (iv)     Liu Yiqiao’s evidence in his affidavit was that he noted that the 3rd Defendant did not go up the stairs after colliding with Jun Xian, and therefore believed that the 3rd Defendant did not accidentally collide with Jun Xian in order to go up the stairs. During cross-examination, his evidence was that he did not think there was a possibility of the collision being an accident, because there was a lot of space for the 3rd Defendant to walk if he was walking towards the right of the staircase. The only possibility was that he wanted to go up the stairs. If this was not the case, there would not be any collision. For any normal person, he could have waited over there for others to pass.[^57]

40     One of the common reasons cited for the four witnesses’ belief that the collision was not accidental was that there was a lot of space for the 3rd Defendant to walk towards the left (if viewed from the perspective of a person facing the staircase) of the staircase. Foo Jun Xian’s evidence in this regard was that 1 to 1.5 person could pass through on his right at the point of collision, and that it would not be an issue for 5 to 6 persons to pass through on his left[^58]. I do not think that an allowance of 1 to 1.5 persons can be described as “very wide” and “a lot of space” and that it would be entirely possible for someone passing on the right of Foo Jun Xian walking towards the Corridor to have collided accidentally into Foo Jun Xian.

41     Another reason given in support of the four witnesses’ belief that the collision was not accidental was that a normal person would have shifted to the side if there is space, or waited for the persons to pass first before moving on. The difficulty I had with this reasoning was that this reasoning could also apply equally to the 3rd Defendant, who could also have presumed that the four men in his path could either shift to their left to allow him to pass comfortably to head towards the Corridor, or they could have waited for him to pass first. I note that Foo Jun Xian had given evidence that about two steps before he had reached the staircase landing on the first floor, the 2nd Defendant was already standing on the right of the staircase[^59] (i.e. the Corridor). It would therefore make sense for the 3rd Defendant to have been following her into the said Corridor.

42     Another reason that Foo Jun Xian gave in support of his belief that it was not an accident was that the 3rd Defendant had hit him with great force. Apart from the fact that it was Foo Jun Xian’s subjective view that he was hit with “great force”, this could also have happened given that the 3rd Defendant had testified that the luggage had contained cash and he had wanted to go back to office quickly as he was carrying cash in transit. Further, I found that Foo Jun Xian was unable to provide a credible answer to the Court’s query on why he was so sure that the 3rd Defendant saw him just before the collision if he did not see the 3rd Defendant coming. Foo Jun Xian’s answers in this regard were “I came down the stairs, I was at the staircase landing. I took a look at that woman. That woman was still looking at us. I ignored the woman. I continued walking then I saw the Indian man…” and “\[b\]ecause each time the four of us will go to the bank together. So he recognised the four of us. He knew we were from the same company. Because of this so maybe he was not happy looking at us and did such a thing.”[^60]

43     For the above reasons, I find that the reasons given in support of the four witnesses’ belief that the incident was not accidental are unsatisfactory and have created a reasonable doubt within the case mounted by the Plaintiff. I am therefore unable to find that the Plaintiff has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the 3rd Defendant had deliberately caused the collision between him and Foo Jun Xian in respect of the 26 July Incident, and that the 3rd Defendant had breached paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment in this regard.

**(d)** **_2 August Incident_**

44     Based on the Statement, the Plaintiff’s position is that on or around 2 August 2018, at about 10.30 pm, Wang Meiqin, an operations manager of the Plaintiff, encountered the Defendants. While she was waiting at an entrance to People’s Park Complex, the Defendants came from behind her and proceeded to point their handphones at Wang Meiqin. The 2nd Defendant also loudly accused Wang Meiqin of assaulting her in front of a Watsons store. The 3rd Defendant then pushed Wang Meiqin from the back, despite the fact that she was standing on top of a small flight of stairs. The 2nd Defendant also “gave Wang Meiqin the middle finger”.

45     I first note that Wang Meiqin did not file any affidavit in these proceedings. This was highlighted by the 3rd Defendant in his affidavit[^61]. In response, the Plaintiff’s Managing Director, Huang Guanhua, filed a supplementary affidavit exhibiting a copy of the video of the 2 August Incident, obtained from the closed circuit television cameras controlled by the management of People’s Park Complex (“the CCTV Footage”).[^62]

46     The 3rd Defendant’s evidence in his affidavit in respect of this incident was that it was the subject matter of a separate action by Wang Meiqin against the Defendants under PHA in DC/PHA 113/2018 (“the POHA Action”) and exhibited copies of the affidavits of the Defendants filed in the POHA Action as well as a police report made by him in respect of the incident dated 3 August 2018, the day after the incident. According to the 3rd Defendant, the matter was concluded with a court mediated settlement record on 25 October 2018. While there were some issues arising thereafter, it appears that the POHA Action was effectively concluded as of 11 March 2019.[^63]

47     As set out in the 3rd Defendant’s affidavit in the POHA Action, there was an earlier incident on 2 August 2018 at about 5pm when Wang Meiqin apparently sent one of her subordinates to take a photo of the 2nd Defendant. As for the 2 August Incident, the Defendants were leaving the building after work and they had noticed Wang Meiqin standing at the footsteps just in front of the taxi stand with her phone in her hand. Wang had obviously spotted them approaching. The 2nd Defendant was just ahead of the 3rd Defendant and just as the Defendants were about to pass Wang, the 3rd Defendant heard her say something loudly and aggressively in Chinese. The 2nd Defendant immediately turned on Wang, who also immediately raised her handphone, apparently to photograph or video record the 2nd Defendant. Given the earlier incident on the same day, the 3rd Defendant felt that he should have a photo of Wang filming the 2nd Defendant for record purposes as evidence of harrassment of the 2nd Defendant by Wang. Wang and the 2nd Defendant had a short exchange of words before the Defendants walked to the taxi stand to wait for their taxi. The 3rd Defendant further stated that at no point in time did he get anywhere close enough to push or even touch Wang, neither did he exchange any words with Wang. The 3rd Defendant further alleged that when the Defendants were waiting for their taxi at the taxi stand, Wang, her husband and the Plaintiff’s male employees blocked their taxi after the Defendants had boarded it to prevent them from leaving the place, while shouting and gesticulating aggressively at them and the police had to be called. [^64] The 2nd Defendant stated during cross-examination that she and the 3rd Defendant circled round Wang Meiqin taking videos or photos of her and at the same time, Wang Meiqin was doing the same thing.[^65]

48     I note that the CCTV Footage is undated and while the 3rd Defendant’s evidence during cross-examination was that he did not recognise himself and the 2nd Defendant in the CCTV footage, the 2nd Defendant’s evidence was that although the footage was “very blur”, she presumed it was her and the 3rd Defendant in the CCTV Footage based on the 2 August 2018 Incident.[^66] Given the similarity in appearance of the woman who had appeared at the top of the steps at 03:04 of the CCTV Footage to the 2nd Defendant and that of the man who appeared at the top of the steps at 03:06 to the 3rd Defendant, and that the sequence of events in the CCTV Footage, in general, followed closely to that described by the 3rd Defendant in his affidavit of the 2 August Incident, I am satisfied that the CCTV Footage was that of the 2 August Incident.

49     However, I am unable to determine whether the 2 August Incident had occurred as described in the Statement, or as described by the 3rd Defendant in his affidavit solely based on the CCTV Footage. While the resolution of the CCTV Footage was poor, it appeared that the lady standing at the top of the steps in a light coloured top and a black bottom, presumably Wang Meiqin, had turned her head and body possibly sufficiently at 02:59 of the CCTV Footage, to be able to spot the oncoming Defendants. As the CCTV Footage does not have any accompanying sound and has poor resolution, and Wang Meiqin did not give any evidence, I am unable to determine whether this was the case and further, whether any words were indeed uttered by Wang Meiqin prior to the Defendants arriving at the top of the steps with their mobile phones in their hands. It therefore follows that I am unable to determine whether the Defendants, in pointing their mobile phones at Wang Meiqin, were performing acts which a reasonable person would know to be threatening, abusive, harrassing, intimidating and/or insulting towards Wang Meiqin, or if the Defendants’ version of events were to be believed, whether they were simply trying to protect their own interests by recording the conduct of Wang Meiqin. In addition, the CCTV Footage does not show Wang Meiqin being pushed by the 3rd Defendant at any point in time when she was standing on the steps from the time the 3rd Defendant entered into the frame of the CCTV Footage[^67]. Further, the committal proceedings had proceeded without Wang Meiqin’s affidavit or presence as a witness to be cross-examined on her version of events.[^68] For these reasons, I find that a reasonable doubt has arisen on an assessment of the totality of the evidence and that the Plaintiff has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendants had breached paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment in respect of the 2 August Incident.

**(e)** **_21 September Incident_**

50     The following allegations against the 2nd Defendant are set out in the Statement in respect of the 21 September Incident:

> (a)      _The 2_ nd _Defendant collided with Li Zirong_;

> (b)     Upon being confronted by Li Zirong, _the 2_nd_Defendant took out her handphone and pointed it at Li Zirong_;

> (c)     When Li Zirong responded with “you can record whatever you like”, _the 2_nd_Defendant loudly threatened to beat up Li Zirong_;

> (d)     The 3rd Defendant then came up to the 2nd floor, and shielded the 2nd Defendant, who attempted to kick her and also loudly accused Li Zirong of assaulting her.[^69]

51     In respect of the alleged collision between the 2nd Defendant and Li, there is no indication in the Statement or Li’s affidavit that it was a deliberate act by the 2nd Defendant. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the alleged collision was threatening, abusive, harassing, intimidating and/or insulting.

52     As for the allegation that the 2nd Defendant took out her handphone and pointed it at Li, upon being confronted by Li, it is unclear whether the Plaintiff is relying on this specific act as being threatening, abusive, harassing, intimidating and/or insulting. However, it appears from Li’s affidavit that her shock and distress had come about by being kicked in a public place. Apart from Li testifying during cross-examination that the 2nd Defendant took out the phone wanting to film her[^70], there were no further details in relation to the 2nd Defendant’s alleged act of taking out her handphone and pointing it at Li nor any other evidence to support her allegation.

53     For the allegation that the 2nd Defendant loudly threatened to beat up Li, when Li responded with “you can record whatever you like”, Li stated in her affidavit that she had said to the 2nd Defendant in Chinese that “you can record whatever you like” and the 2nd Defendant’s response was to scream at her and threaten to beat Li up.[^71] No further evidence on the 2nd Defendant’s alleged conduct of threatening to beat up Li was given by either Li or the 2nd Defendant during cross-examination.

54     In respect of the allegation that the 2nd Defendant attempting to kick Li and loudly accusing Li of assaulting her while the 3rd Defendant shielded the 2nd Defendant, while Li had stated in her affidavit that the 3rd Defendant had tried to shield the 2nd Defendant, she clarified during her evidence in chief that the 3rd Defendant had tried to restrain the 2nd Defendant instead of shielding her. Based on Li’s evidence alone, it is clear that the 3rd Defendant, by trying to restrain the 2nd Defendant, had in no way breached paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment.

55     A substantial portion of the cross-examination and re-examination of Li and the Defendants in respect of the 21 September Incident focused on video footage exhibited in Li’s affidavit which she claimed contained the 2nd Defendant’s attempt to kick her. As mentioned above, it appears from Li’s affidavit that her shock and distress had come about by being kicked in a public place. I note that while Li mentioned “being kicked” in her affidavit, this allegation is missing from the Statement, which is limited to the 2nd Defendant’s _attempt_ to kick Li.

56     The 2nd Defendant conceded during cross-examination that she had thrust her feet forward and stamped on the ground towards Li.[^72] Li had exhibited video footage of the 2nd Defendant’s alleged attempt to kick her in her affidavit. The 4 minute and 54 second video clip was recorded in slow motion from 00:09 to 004:46 (during which there were no discernible words) and did not capture the faces of the three individuals involved (although there were three different pairs of shoes seen). The 2nd Defendant stated during cross-examination that she presumed that the person in the video clip with jeans and blue shoes was her[^73], and the person with white shoes was Li[^74] while the remaining person was the 3rd Defendant[^75]. The 2nd Defendant subsequently agreed that the video footage was the video of the 21 September Incident.[^76] It is clear from the video footage that the 2nd Defendant raised her knee and kicked forward with her right foot, with her right foot then landing outside the frame between 04:20 to 04:23, and thereafter her right foot retracted back into the frame at 04:25 and swung out of the frame and back into the frame between 04:28 and 04:32. The 2nd Defendant further admitted that she had said, “You don’t hit people. You don’t hit people” at 04:46 of the video footage. It is clear from the video footage that the 2nd Defendant had said this rather loudly. Given the 2nd Defendant’s concession that she had thrust her feet forward and stamped on the ground towards Li and that she had said, “You don’t hit people. You don’t hit people”, and the actions recorded in the video footage, I find beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2nd Defendant had attempted to kick Li and also loudly accused Li of assaulting her.

57     However, this does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the Plaintiff has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2nd Defendant had breached paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment in respect of the 2 August Incident. As mentioned above, the meaning of “threatening”, abusive”, “harassing” and “insulting” should be interpreted by drawing reference from section 3(1)(a) PHA, and I would accord these words and the word “intimidating” their common-sense meaning.

58     It is important to determine the factors that need to be taken into consideration in order to determine whether a reasonable person would know the 2nd Defendant’s acts and words during the 21 September Incident to be threatening, abusive, harassing, intimidating and/or insulting. The Minister for Law stated in the Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (13 March 2014), “Protection from Harassment Bill” Vol 91 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law) that:

> _“Whether or not a particular conduct amounts to harassment under the Bill depends on the factual matrix of each case. Reasonableness of conduct is a defence to all of the offences under the Bill and the Court will have to consider, inter alia: the nature of the allegedly offending act in question; the context in which those acts occurred; and the effect of those actions on the victim. These have to be considered in their totality before deciding whether an offence is made out, or whether other civil remedies should be ordered…Mr \[Patrick\] Tay is concerned with clarifying more precisely the ambit of harassment, but there are just far too many situations to be exhaustively covered in an FAQ. Further, really whether something is or is not an offence, will have to depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the conduct or the communication at hand. And it is not desirable for us today to fetter the discretion of the courts in these matters.”_

59     While Plaintiff’s counsel accepts that based on the Minister of Law’s speech for the Second Reading of the Bill on 13 March 2014, an analysis of the factual matrix and specific circumstances of each case is required, their submission is that it is the consequence of the conduct, which is imperative, and not where and how that conduct was carried out. While the Minister had indeed stated that “\[i\]t must be the consequence of the conduct, not where and how that conduct was carried out” in his speech[^77], this was said in the context of highlighting that harassment and related anti-social behaviour are offences, whether committed in the physical world or online, i.e. that it is not the type of medium through which the harassment and related anti-social behaviour takes place that is important. It is clear from the extract set out in \[58\] above that the nature of the 2nd Defendant’s acts and words, the context in which these acts and words occurred and the effect of those actions on the victim are all relevant to determine whether the said acts and words had breached paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment.

60     I note the following in relation to the context in which the 2nd Defendant’s acts and words occurred:

> (i)     Based on the Statement, the 21 September 2018 Incident begun with a collision between the 2nd Defendant and Li, which then led to the 2nd Defendant being _confronted_ by Li. Li, in her affidavit, also made clear that she had turned around to _confront_ the 2nd Defendant.

> (ii)     Based on the Statement and Li’s affidavit, it was upon being confronted by Li that the 2nd Defendant took out her handphone and pointed it at Li.

> (iii)     Based on the Statement and Li’s affidavit, it was when Li responded with “you can record whatever you like” that the 2nd Defendant loudly threatened to beat up Li.

> (iv)     Li did not leave the scene of the 21 September Incident during the 2 to 3 minutes that passed between the moment that the 2nd Defendant called the 3rd Defendant, to the moment that the 3rd Defendant turned up and had instead also telephoned her colleague for her colleague to come over.[^78]

> (v)     The 2nd Defendant admitted that she had said at the beginning of the video clip at 0:00 to 0:03, the statements “Call Police, she want to beat me” in English and the statement “you hit people, right?” in Chinese. However, she denied that the subsequent statement in Chinese “come, make a phone call” at 0:05 was made by her[^79]. On the other hand, Li’s evidence was that the 2nd Defendant was the one who made the statement “come, make a phone call”[^80]. It is clear to me that the voice of the person making the statement “come, make a phone call” was different from that of the 2nd Defendant’s. While I am unable to determine if that statement was made by Li, it is clear that the person who had made the statement had done so in response to the 2nd Defendant’s statement to call the police and that Li wanted to beat her.

> (vi)     Based on the Statement, the 3rd Defendant was _shielding_ the 2nd Defendant and this was also set out in Li’s affidavit, although she clarified during evidence-in-chief that she wished to amend the statement to read “the 3rd Defendant tried to restrain her” instead of “the 3rd Defendant tried to shield her”. Given that the Statement sets out the grounds on which the Defendants’ committals are sought[^81] and there is no amendment to the Statement, it remains the Plaintiff’s position that the 3rd Defendant was shielding the 2nd Defendant. This also appears to be consistent with the conduct recorded by the video footage, as the 2nd Defendant appears to move backwards while Li’s white shoe advances towards her between 02:35 and 02:52, with the 3rd Defendant starting to move between the two parties during this time.

> (vii)     From 02:56 to 03:57, the frame only shows the 3rd Defendant’s shirt, and this indicates that Li’s hand that was holding the phone was very close to the 3rd Defendant. This is consistent with the 3rd Defendant’s statement in his police report that while he was standing in between the 2nd Defendant and Li, “the troublemaker lady didn’t move back and tried to get physical contact with me…”.

> (viii)    From 04:33 to 04:34, after the 2nd Defendant had attempted to kick Li, Li’s white shoe advanced towards the 2nd Defendant and the 3rd Defendant thereafter once again moved himself between the 2nd Defendant and Li between 04:34 to 04:39.

61     Looked at in totality, the 2nd Defendant’s actions and words occurred in the context of an ongoing confrontation between the 2nd Defendant and Li involving words and physical movements towards each other.

62     Further, in respect of the effect of the 2nd Defendant’s actions and words on Li, while Li claimed that the shock and distress of being kicked in a public place caused her to experience stomach pains and nausea, she has only provided a copy of her medical certificate and invoice[^82], which do not show the reasons for her medical leave. No medical report was produced by Li in this regard. I further note that Li’s actions as set out in the Statement and video above do not indicate that she was in shock or distress.

63     For the reasons above, I find that a reasonable doubt has arisen on an assessment of the totality of the evidence, I am unable to find that the Plaintiff has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2nd Defendant has breached paragraph 3 of the Consent Judgment in respect of the 21 September Incident.

## Conclusion

64     For the above reasons, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s application for an order of committal to be made against the Defendants. I will hear parties on costs.
