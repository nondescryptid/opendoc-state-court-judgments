### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to six charges under the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) in relation to his granddaughter (“the Victim”):

> (a)     5 charges of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code, and

> (b)     1 charge of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(1)(a) punishable under s 376(4)(b) of the Penal Code.

2       The Prosecution applied successfully to admit both of the Victim’s statements as substantive evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”). The Victim’s evidence, as contained in both her statements,[^1] was consistent with and reinforced by the Accused’s confessions,[^2] which were in turn undergirded by the testimony of an eye-witness (Victim’s male cousin).

3       All things considered, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused.

4       I set out my reasons.

## Charges and legal context

5       The Accused claimed trial to the following six charges under the Penal Code:

![]([2021] SGDC 0185_Image/[2021] SGDC 0185_image2.png)

6       The fact that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt has been described as the proverbial golden thread which runs throughout the web of our criminal law: _Winston Lee Siew Boon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1184</span> at \[61\] to \[76\]. The Court must always bear in mind that the starting point of the analysis of any criminal case is not neutral – an accused person is presumed innocent and this presumption is not displaced until the Prosecution has discharged its burden of proof: _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at \[61\].

## Prosecution’s case

7       The Accused had voluntarily given his Contemporaneous Statement[^3] and Cautioned Statement[^4] recorded on 26 September 2017 at 8.06 p.m..

8       The Victim had also voluntarily given her two statements to the police.[^5] The Victim’s evidence, as contained in both her statements, was undergirded by the testimony of an eye-witness, _viz._ her male cousin.

9       The Prosecution sought to impeach the Victim’s credit on portions of her two statements and her court testimony under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act,[^6] and to admit both of these statements as substantive evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act.[^7]

10     The Prosecution also sought to impeach the Accused’s wife’s credit on portions of her statement to the police and her testimony in court under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act.

11     The Victim’s version in court (i.e. she was at KK Hospital due to head lice and itchy scalp) was inconsistent with both the documentary evidence (e.g. KK Hospital’s medical documents) as well as the various doctors’ testimony in court that the Victim had experienced pain while urinating.

12     The Victim told at least 10 people that the Accused had sexually assaulted her. These 10 people included police officers (Station Inspector Ananth Kumar Alagiri Balasubramaniam, Insp Mohamed Salim bin Maidin, Insp Mohamad Noor, ASP Alvin Chua and ASP Jagathiswari), a child protection officer (Zhuo Xiaojun), a staff nurse (Lai Yuan Kei) and doctors (Dr Lee Mei Sung, Dr Seet Meei Jiun, and Dr Mahesh Sangrithi).

## Defence’s case

13     In 2015, the Victim was not at home during the day as she attended the Just Kids Learning Centre from about 8a.m. until about 6p.m..[^8]

14     On 21 September 2017, the Victim’s mother’s employment was terminated, and she took care of the Victim.[^9] Since 21, 22 or 23 September 2017[^10], the Victim’s mother and her two daughters did not return to the Accused’s home. Hence, the Victim was not at the Accused’s home on 24 September 2017.[^11]

15     Many people were staying at the Accused’s home in 2015 and 2017, including the Accused, his wife, 4 grandchildren (including the Victim), and the Victim’s mother.[^12] The Accused’s wife was at home as she is a housewife.[^13]

16     The Accused was working full-time as a chauffeur.[^14] On weekdays, he would leave home at 7a.m. and sometimes return at about 9p.m. to midnight; he worked overtime every weekday. He did not return home during office hours. He also worked almost every weekend from about 6a.m. to 10p.m. or 11p.m. and some public holidays.

17     In the circumstances, there was no opportunity for the Accused to have committed the offences against the Victim in the home.[^15] The Accused had never watched television with the Victim.[^16] The Victim and her sister were not allowed to enter the master bedroom.[^17]

18     The Accused did not play catching with the Victim and her sister as he has a torn knee.[^18] The Victim wore diapers.[^19]

## Ancillary hearings

19      Challenging the Statements’ Voluntariness. The Accused challenged the voluntariness of his Contemporaneous Statement and Cautioned Statement. Two ancillary hearings were held.

### The Law for Ancillary Hearings

20     Where voluntariness is challenged, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were made voluntarily and not on the Defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the statements were not made voluntarily: _Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span> (“_Kadar_”) at \[177\], and _Azman bin Mohamed Sanwan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 733</span> at \[19\]-\[27\] (see also Ho Hock Lai, _On the Obtaining and Admissibility of Incriminating Statements_, SJLS \[2016\] 249 at 253-255 and 260-261).

21     It is only necessary for the Prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat, inducement or promise, and not every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear: _Panya Martmontree v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 806</span> at \[32\] (see also Chin Tet Yung, _Criminal Procedure Code 2010: Confessions and Statements by Accused Persons Revisited_, <span class="citation">(2012) 24 SAcLJ 60</span> at \[16\]-\[33\] and \[52\]-\[53\]).

22     The voluntariness test is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective: _Sulaiman bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 557</span> at \[39\]. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise. The subjective limb is satisfied when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the offender’s mind through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge: _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[53\] (see also Dorcas Quek, _The Concept of Voluntariness in the Law of Confessions_, <span class="citation">(2005) 17 SAcLJ 819</span> at \[35\]).

23     The litmus test for oppression is whether the investigation was, by its nature, duration or other attendant circumstances, such as to affect the accused person’s mind and will such that he speaks when he otherwise would have remained silent: _Tey Tsun Hang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1189</span> at \[113\]. The same standard applies even where the allegation is not that the accused person would have remained silent, but that he would have given a different version of the statement, had he not been oppressed: _Public Prosecutor v Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 105</span> at \[52\].

24     The Court of Appeal in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_ summarised the test for oppression as follows (at \[56\]-\[57\]): “(o)ppression is a circumstance which may render a confession involuntary and thus inadmissible, and whether the accused has been subjected to oppression is a question of fact … In other words, a statement would not be extracted by oppression unless the accused was in such a state that his will was ‘sapped’ and he could not resist making a statement which he would otherwise not have made”.

25     In this regard, Explanation 1 to s 258 of the CPC states that:

> If a statement is obtained from an accused by a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that _his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement_, and the court is of the opinion that such acts gave the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement, he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him, such acts will amount to a threat, an inducement or a promise, as the case may be, which will render the statement inadmissible. \[emphasis added\]

26     For completeness, there is no necessity for interrogators to remove all discomfort. Some discomfort has to be expected – the issue is whether such discomfort is of such a great extent that it causes the making of an involuntary statement: Court of Appeal in _Yeo See How v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 277</span> at \[40\].

27     Even if an accused person’s statement is voluntary, the court can exclude it if its prejudicial value outweighs its probative value, for example, where there is lack of language interpretation or procedural flaws in the recording which cast serious doubts on the accuracy of the statement recorded: _Kadar_ at \[53\]-\[56\] and _Sulaiman bin Jumari_ at \[54\].

### 1st Ancillary hearing (Accused)

#### (a)   Allegations against the police officers

28     The Defence levelled the following allegations against Inspector Mohamad Noor Aboe Bakar (who recorded the Contemporaneous Statement),[^20] Superintendent Burhanudeen[^21] and ASP Alvin Chua[^22] (see generally, _Public Prosecutor v Tan Lye Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 564</span> at \[52\]):

> (a)     Officers raised their voice at the Accused in Malay, called him “stupid” and threatened to put his family in trouble.[^23]

> (b)     An officer told the Accused in Malay that if he admits to the offences, they are willing to help him.[^24]

> (c)     The Accused was asked to sign a blank piece of paper at the interview room.[^25] After several days, he was asked to initial some amendments.[^26]

#### (b)   Police officers’ testimony

29     After the ancillary hearing, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Contemporaneous Statement recorded on 26 September 2017 from 3.30 p.m. to 4.10 p.m. had been voluntarily given, and admitted it into evidence.[^27] My reasons are as follows.

30     Insp Mohamad Noor, Supt Burhanudeen and ASP Alvin Chua denied all the allegations. Insp Mohamad Noor said that the Accused spoke English fluently and was able to read in English.[^28] Before the statement was recorded, the Accused chose to speak in English.[^29] Supt Burhanudeen was only inside the interview room for a short period,[^30] and he left the interview room before the statement recording begun.[^31]

31     Insp Mohamad Noor denied that he and/or Supt Burhanudeen raised their voice at the Accused and called him “stupid”.[^32] Insp Mohamad Noor also denied that an officer threatened to put the Accused’s family in trouble unless he admitted to the offence.[^33] Insp Mohamad Noor denied that he and/or Supt Burhanudeen told the Accused that if he admits to the offences, they are willing to help him.[^34] Insp Mohamad Noor denied handing the Accused a blank sheet of paper to sign.[^35] He also denied making cancellations to the statement two to three days later.[^36]

32     Insp Mohamad Noor candidly admitted that it had most probably slipped his mind to sign against these cancellations and he could not recall why he did not sign them.[^37] After the statement was recorded, Insp Mohamad Noor read it back in English to the Accused, handed the statement to the Accused to read it himself, and invited him to make amendments.[^38]

33     Allied to this, Supt Burhanudeen testified that the Accused was fluent in English,[^39] and that he was not handcuffed during the interview on 26 September 2017.[^40] Supt Burhanudeen denied that he had raised his voice at the Accused and called him “stupid”.[^41] Supt Burhanudeen denied threatening to put the Accused’s family in trouble unless he admitted to the offence.[^42] Supt Burhanudeen also denied telling the Accused that if he admits to the offences, they are willing to help him.[^43] Supt Burhanudeen said that he sat beside Insp Mohamad Noor.[^44]

34     Supt Burhanudeen explained that as he was then the Deputy Head of the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch, and he oversees the management of investigations and operations in the entire branch, he makes the first assessment of a witness and conducts interviews if necessary.[^45] This was why he spoke to the Accused for about 10 minutes on 26 September 2017.[^46] I found this to be a reasonable explanation.

35     Supt Burhanudeen is a candid witness, for example, he said that he could not remember certain details, for example, the Accused’s education level and occupation.[^47] Supt Burhanudeen testified that the Accused had confessed to the offence by informing that he had penetrated the Victim’s mouth (which did not feature in the Victim’s version to the police), thus, there was no reason to threaten, induce or promise the Accused.[^48]

36     Both Supt Burhanudeen and ASP Alvin Chua testified that the interview room had a suspect’s bench[^49] (not a chair) and a wooden door that would be closed during the witness interview.[^50] I found this to be a reasonable explanation. In fact, if someone had really threatened, induced or promised the Accused, it is more likely than not that the door would be closed rather than left wide open.

37     ASP Alvin Chua testified that the Accused spoke English.[^51] ASP Alvin Chua testified that he had already seen the contemporaneous statement (with the two amendments made and counter-signed) on the same day that it had been recorded, _viz._ 26 September 2017.[^52]

38     In sum, I accepted the evidence of Insp Mohamad Noor, Supt Burhanudeen, and ASP Alvin Chua, which I found to be consistent and credible. As against this, the Accused’s evidence was inconsistent and not credible.[^53]

#### (c)   Accused’s testimony

##### (1)   Accused’s testimony kept changing

39     The Accused admitted that his court testimony kept changing, as evidenced by the following three examples:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="8.48%"> <col width="45.68%"> <col width="45.84%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Accused’s Earlier</b></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Testimony</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Accused’s Subsequent Testimony</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(a)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">It was <em>Insp Mohamad Noor</em> who asked him to sign a blank piece of paper<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">It was <em>Supt Burhanudeen</em> who asked him to sign a blank piece of paper<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(b)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">The Accused had cried during the interview<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">The Accused had <em>not</em> cried during the interview<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(c)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">ASP Alvin Chua had read the statement to him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">ASP Alvin Chua had <em>not</em> read the statement to him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

##### (2)   Implausibility of the Accused’s version

40     The Accused’s version is also implausible: _Public Prosecutor v Kannan s/o R Kumaran_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 36</span> at \[138\]. In his version of events, he signed only a _blank_ piece of paper at the interview room, and a few days later, he initialled several amendments to the document. For all this to be true, all three police officers — who did not know the Accused before the investigations[^60] — had to be in cahoots to frame him. They had to take the risk of asking the Accused to sign on an empty sheet of paper,[^61] with Insp Mohamad Noor subsequently filling in the details,[^62] before ASP Alvin Chua finally asking the Accused to initial two amendments sometime later.[^63] I found this to be highly unlikely and difficult to believe.

##### (3)   Police officers were not cross-examined on various points

41     The police officers were _not_ cross-examined on various points that only surfaced during the Accused’s examination-in-chief, such as (a) Insp Mohamad Noor speaking to him in a rough manner in the car,[^64] (b) Insp Mohamad Noor telling him that he cannot take his medication for asthma and high cholesterol because he had committed an offence,[^65] (c) Supt Burhanudeen handing him an empty piece of paper to sign and write down his NRIC number,[^66] and (d) Supt Burhanudeen telling him to just admit so that everyone’s job will be easier and the family will be comforted:[^67] rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67.

##### (4)   Accused’s allegations unsupported by any other evidence

42     The Accused’s allegations against the officers were unsupported by any other evidence. In particular, by his account, he did not say that he complained of any mistreatment after the statement recording to any of the other police officers, including the lock-up officers: _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Abdul Hadi bin Haron_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 8</span> at \[16\] (see generally, _Public Prosecutor v Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 105</span> at \[66\] and \[100(d)\], _Public Prosecutor v Irwan bin Ali_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 191</span> at \[55\]-\[56\], and _Imran bin Mohd Arip v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 744</span> at \[45\]).

43     No police report was lodged by the Accused even after he was placed on bail.[^68] And the Accused’s allegations were not found in any of his ten police statements.[^69] There was also no mention in the Case for his Defence of a blank piece of paper for his Contemporaneous Statement, that promises were made to the Accused, and that he did not understand English.[^70]

44     The Accused could not explain why all 3 police officers would fabricate the Contemporaneous Statement to frame him with such a serious offence.[^71] Insp Mohamad Noor was the detaining officer[^72] and after recording the Contemporaneous Statement, he was not subsequently involved in the investigations. There was insufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case.

45     The Accused said that he speaks broken English.[^73] The Accused’s claim that he did not really understand English was implausible. On several occasions during the trial, the Accused corrected the interpreter’s English, for example, he substituted her use of the word “bench” with “chair”.[^74] And he answered questions posed in English without waiting for the translation (_Public Prosecutor v BQD_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 183</span> at \[27\]).[^75] In addition, during the trial, he read several documents that were tendered as court exhibits.

##### (5)   Self-perceived promise/ inducement

46     The Accused’s claim that he thought that Insp Mohamad Noor and Supt Burhanudeen would help him because they are Malays is a self-perceived promise or inducement, which does not render a statement involuntary:[^76] Court of Appeal in _Lu Lai Heng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 1037</span> at \[19\], reiterated in _Kelvin Chai_ at \[55\], and subsequently followed in numerous cases (see most recently, _Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz and another_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 268</span> at \[31\], and _Public Prosecutor v Imran bin Mohd Arip and others_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 155</span> at \[33\]).

##### (6)   Selective in what he said in the Contemporaneous Statement

47     Finally, I find that the Accused was in fact being selective in what he said in the Contemporaneous Statement. For example, he chose to say that “I did not insert my finger into her vagina … She did not suck my penis”:[^77]_Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 67</span> at \[263\].

### 2nd Ancillary hearing (Accused)

#### (a)   Allegation against the recorder

48     The Defence stated that Ms Carol Ong Bee Choo[^78] had recorded a Cautioned Statement even though the Accused was not in a proper state of mind to provide a statement.[^79] This was essentially a claim of oppression.

#### (b)   Cautioned Statement was voluntarily given

49     After the ancillary hearing, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Cautioned Statement recorded on 26 September 2017 from 8.06 p.m. to 8.20 p.m. had been voluntarily given, and admitted it into evidence.[^80] My reasons are as follows.

##### (1)   Dr Yak Si Mian’s Evidence

50     First, I accepted the evidence of Dr Yak Si Mian.[^81] There was no reason for Dr Yak to lie — he was the doctor who examined the Accused before and after the recording of the Cautioned Statement: _Public Prosecutor v Salzawiyah bte Latib_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 16</span> at \[86\]. The purpose of these medical examinations is to document any injuries and assess whether the person is in the right physical condition to understand the charge and provide a statement.[^82]

51     In Dr Yak’s assessment, the Accused was in a position to provide the Cautioned Statement.[^83] This is because the Accused’s giddiness, which started that day, was non-vertiginous and mild.[^84] He was otherwise well.[^85] His physical examination was fine except for slightly elevated blood pressure;[^86] his blood pressure came down during the post-statement medical examination[^87] and his vital signs were normal.[^88]

52     The Accused was alert.[^89] His heart, lungs and cranial nerves were normal.[^90] He did not have fever, breathlessness, or observable injuries.[^91]

53     As the Accused’s Ventolin inhaler for asthma was with the authorities, coupled with the fact that he did not complain about his asthma, Dr Yak stated that it was unlikely that he used the inhaler before his Cautioned Statement was recorded.[^92] It was also unlikely that the Accused took the Dimenate medication before statement-recording.[^93] As the Accused did not have his other medication with him, Dr Yak asked his family members to bring this down for him.[^94]

54     When Dr Yak asked him, the Accused stated that he had no complaints.[^95] Dr Yak recorded his notes in the NP306 documents immediately upon examining the Accused.[^96]

55     Dr Yak had posed open-ended questions to the Accused, who spoke in English without an interpreter.[^97] The Accused did not request for an interpreter and appeared to understand the entire conversation.[^98] It was possible that the Accused used some Malay words but not more than 1 or 2 Malay words as Dr Yak does not understand Malay.[^99]

##### (2)   Ms Carol Ong’s Evidence

56     Second, I accepted the evidence of Ms Carol Ong.[^100] She testified that she had asked the Accused whether he was well prior to recording the Cautioned Statement, and he did not complain that he was unwell during the recording.[^101] The Accused’s demeanour was “nothing out of the ordinary” and he did not look puzzled or lost during the recording of the Cautioned Statement.[^102] Ms Carol Ong stated that she had looked at the Accused and he had nodded his head to indicate that he understood the charge.[^103] Ms Carol Ong’s practice was to engage the services of an interpreter during statement recording.[^104]

##### (3)   Mr Mohammad Rashikin’s Evidence

57     Third, Ms Carol Ong’s evidence was fortified by the testimony of the interpreter, Mr Mohammad Rashikin.[^105] I accepted his evidence. Mr Mohammad Rashikin testified that Ms Carol Ong had asked the Accused whether he was well and comfortable prior to recording the Cautioned Statement.[^106] The Accused did not look puzzled or lost during the recording of the Cautioned Statement; the Accused appeared well to Mr Mohammad Rashikin.[^107] The Accused had nodded his head several times to indicate that he understood what was going on and what was read to him.[^108] When Mr Mohammad Rashikin asked him whether he understood, the Accused replied “yes” in Malay.[^109]

58     Mr Mohammad Rashikin testified that the Accused looked calm, normal and comfortable.[^110] He appeared well and did not appear to be giddy.[^111] If the giddiness had affected him, the statement-recording would have been stopped.[^112]

59     Mr Mohammad Rashikin stated that the Accused understands English because at times he spoke in English even before the question had been interpreted.[^113] The Accused understood the warning on page 3 of the Cautioned Statement because he immediately wanted to say something but Mr Mohammad Rashikin told him to wait until the next page.[^114] Mr Mohammad Rashikin described the Accused as having an average command of the English language.[^115]

60     There was no reason for these three witnesses (Dr Yak,[^116] Ms Carol Ong[^117] and Mr Mohammad Rashikin[^118]), who did not know the Accused beforehand to lie: _Public Prosecutor v Salzawiyah bte Latib_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 16</span> at \[86\]. Both Dr Yak and Mr Mohammad Rashikin were not involved in the investigations; Mr Mohammad Rashikin had resigned from the police force in June 2021.[^119]

##### (4)   Contents of Cautioned Statement show that the Accused was sufficiently alert

61     Fourth, the court is entitled to examine the contents of an impugned statement to determine whether it should be excluded or not. This is particularly so in situations such as the present where the allegations centred on the level of alertness and consciousness of the person making the statement. The paramount concern of the court here is the reliability of the statement and it would be artificial and against common sense not to look at the contents of the statement when deciding whether there was prejudicial effect that outweighed its probative value. This is because the answers in the statement may reveal facts which were known only to the person making the statement or details which could not have been uttered by a person who was so mentally exhausted or confused or who was drifting in and out of consciousness: _Sulaiman bin Jumari_ at \[85\] and _Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 103</span> at \[62\]-\[64\] (see generally, _Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 268</span> at \[19\]-\[20\]).

62     In the present case, the contents of the Cautioned Statement show that the Accused was sufficiently alert. For example, he was selective and chose to say that “I did not use force on her”:[^120]_Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi_ at \[263\]. It was also the Accused who wanted to add two sentences at the bottom of page 4 of the Cautioned Statement, _viz._ “I would like to apologise to my family. That is all.”[^121] Mr Mohammad Rashikin had testified that the handwritten portions on page 4 were a literal translation of what the Accused had said in Malay.[^122]

63     The Accused’s alertness is also demonstrated by the fact that even on his own account, he could _remember_ what he had said during the recording of the Cautioned Statement. For example, the Accused claimed that the version he had given was not reflected in contents of the Cautioned Statement.[^123] He alleged that he had said that he was just joking around with his granddaughter and they had chased and tickled each other.[^124]

##### (5)   Signatures were elaborate and signed in a consistent manner

64     Fifth, the Accused’s 11 signatures were elaborate and signed in a consistent manner, which militated against believing the Accused’s claim that he was in pain, confused and weak.[^125] The Accused admitted that he did _not_ tell Ms Carol Ong or Mr Mohammad Rashikin about being in pain, confused and weak.[^126]

65     In addition, Ms Carol Ong and Mr Mohammad Rashikin were not cross-examined on various points that only surfaced during the Accused’s testimony, such as (a) the Accused telling an officer in the Toyota Altis about being in pain, confused and weak,[^127] (b) the Accused signing all 11 signatures at one go,[^128] (c) the Accused’s version not being reflected in the Cautioned Statement[^129] and (d) the Accused not understanding Mr Mohammad Rashikin’s interpretation in Malay as he was speaking very quickly:[^130] rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67.

##### (6)   The Accused understood the interpreter

66     Sixth, I did not accept the Accused’s claim that he did not understand Mr Mohammad Rashikin’s interpretation in Malay as he was speaking very quickly.[^131] Besides not cross-examining Mr Mohammad Rashikin on this point,[^132] it is odd that the Accused did not simply ask him to slow down.[^133] Even on the Accused’s own account, he understood that it was time to offer a defence to the charge, as he claimed to have said that he was just joking around with his granddaughter and they had chased and tickled each other.[^134] The Accused also understands English, as evidenced by him answering a question under cross-examination before it had been interpreted.[^135]

##### (7)   Inconsistencies in the Accused’s testimony

67     Seventh, the Accused’s testimony was riven with inconsistencies.[^136] For example, he flip-flopped on whether Mr Mohammad Rashikin had (a) read all 5 pages of the Cautioned Statement in Malay _but_ only explained the first page,[^137] (b) read all 5 pages of the Cautioned Statement in Malay _without_ explaining any page[^138] or (c) only read the _first page_ of the Cautioned Statement in Malay without reading the remaining pages.[^139]

68     Against the above backdrop, I did not find the Accused’s allegations to be plausible:

> (a)     He claimed to have nodded to Ms Carol Ong because he was in pain and thinking about his own body condition.[^140] His explanation is odd as he could simply have shaken his head or voiced his discomfort.[^141]

> (b)     He claimed to have signed the Cautioned Statement due to his desire to expedite the process as he was sick and wanted his medication.[^142] Again, his explanation is odd as he could simply have voiced his discomfort.

> (c)     He claimed that he was affected by the fact that the last time he had taken his medication was at 7 a.m. that day.[^143] As against this, his physical examination was fine, and Dr Yak found him alert and in a position to provide the Cautioned Statement.

69     In sum, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Cautioned Statement had been voluntarily given, as seen from a summary of what happened before, during, and after the statement recording:

> (a)      Before Statement Recording:

>> (i)       Dr Yak had conducted a pre-statement medical examination and found the Accused to be alert and in a position to provide the Cautioned Statement. This medical examination was done just before the recording of the statement. When Dr Yak asked him, the Accused stated that he had no complaints.

>> (ii)       Ms Carol Ong had asked the Accused whether he was well and comfortable and he had nodded. This is supported by Mr Mohammad Rashikin’s evidence.

> (b)      During Statement Recording:

>> (i)       A Malay interpreter, Mr Mohammad Rashikin, assisted the Accused.

>> (ii)       The Accused looked calm, normal and comfortable. He appeared well and did not appear to be giddy. The Accused did not look puzzled or lost.

>> (iii)       The Accused nodded his head several times to indicate that he understood what was going on and what was read to him. When Mr Mohammad Rashikin asked him whether he understood, the Accused replied “yes” in Malay.

> (c)      After Statement Recording:

>> (i)       Dr Yak had conducted a post-statement medical examination and found the Accused to be alert and in a position to provide the Cautioned Statement. This medical examination was conducted almost immediately (about one minute) after the recording of the statement.

>> (ii)       The contents of the Cautioned Statement show that the Accused was alert. For example, he was selective in what he said and it was also the Accused who wanted to add the fifth line on page 4 of the Cautioned Statement.

>> (iii)       The Accused’s 11 signatures were elaborate and signed in a consistent manner, which militated against believing the Accused’s claim that he was in pain, confused and weak.

70     In other words, the evidence did not point to the Accused being in a state of mind such that the Cautioned Statement should not be admitted. Indeed, the surrounding evidence of the recording, the testimony of witnesses including a medical doctor and interpreter, and the Cautioned Statement itself, indicated that the Accused was lucid: _Public Prosecutor v Lokman bin Abdul Rahman_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 48</span> at \[53\].

### Summary for ancillary hearings (Accused)

71     In sum, I found that the Contemporaneous Statement[^144] and Cautioned Statement[^145] were voluntarily given, and admitted them into evidence. I was mindful that a trial judge has a discretion, and indeed a duty, throughout the trial to reconsider his decision to admit statements given by an accused person if further evidence emerges that raises doubt about their admissibility: ss 279(7) and 279(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) (see _Tan Lye Heng_ at \[2\] and \[24\]-\[36\]).

72     It is settled law that an accused person can be convicted on his own confessions, even if they were retracted, if the court is satisfied that they were made voluntarily and that they are true, and there is no need for corroborative evidence to support them: Court of Appeal in _Thongthot Yordsa-Art and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 412</span> at \[22\], and _Syed Abdul Mutalip bin Syed Sidek & Anor v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 1166</span> at \[20\] to \[23\].

73     In the present case, the Accused was read back his various Statements by the recorders and was invited to amend any part of his statements before acknowledging that they were correct.[^146] In this regard, the Accused added to his Cautioned Statement by including two sentences at the bottom of page 4: “I would like to apologise to my family. That is all.”[^147] The Accused’s exculpatory version of the facts at the trial was not found in his Contemporaneous Statement[^148] or Cautioned Statement[^149] (see, for example, _Syed Abdul Mutalip bin Syed Sidek & Anor_ at \[23\]).

74     My finding that the Contemporaneous Statement[^150] and Cautioned Statement[^151] were voluntarily given was fortified by the following six points.

75     First, the Accused did not complain at all to Dr Ong,[^152] Dr Yak,[^153] or Dr Lin Hanjie[^154] about his encounters with the police officers.[^155] And the Accused also did not complain about anything to the nurses.[^156] There was no reason for all three doctors (Dr Ong,[^157] Dr Yak,[^158] Dr Lin) and the nurses, who neither knew the Accused beforehand nor were involved in the investigations, to lie: _Public Prosecutor v Salzawiyah bte Latib_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 16</span> at \[86\].

76     Second, Dr Lin Hanjie[^159] examined the Accused on 27 September 2017, that is, _before_ the Accused had taken his medication. Dr Lin assessed him to be alert, comfortable at rest, able to obey instructions and responsive.[^160] The Accused’s vital signs were normal.[^161] He was not in any distress, had no chest pains or shortness of breath.[^162] The Accused was ambulant with a normal gait.[^163] He was of a sound mind.[^164] He had no complaints.[^165]

77     Dr Lin also testified that the Accused spoke to him entirely in English without an interpreter.[^166] Dr Lin and the Accused were able to have a meaningful conversation in English,[^167] and some of Dr Lin’s questions were open-ended.[^168] The Accused had described his medical conditions to Dr Lin in English.[^169]

78     Third, the Accused testified during the main trial that he had said the following sentence to ASP Alvin Chua: “I might have made a mistake on the dates when _I mentioned it was last Friday during the interview yesterday_” (emphasis added).[^170] This was inconsistent with the Accused’s claim that he had _not_ given the Contemporaneous Statement[^171] to the police. Furthermore, in P20, the Accused had also stated that for “the latest incident, _which I initially mentioned was on Friday 22 Sep 2017_ and later I recalled it was actually happened on Saturday, which was 23 Sep 2017” (emphasis added).[^172]

79     Fourth, for the Cautioned Statement,[^173] the Accused’s alertness can be seen by his claim in the main trial that he had deliberately made up stories.[^174]

80     Fifth, while the Defence did not challenge the voluntariness of the long statements,[^175] ASP Alvin Chua testified that the Accused chose to speak in English during the recording of his long statements (see also _Public Prosecutor v Chong Hoon Cheong_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 211</span> at \[102\]),[^176] with the Accused having the option of also speaking in Malay as a Malay interpreter was present.[^177] The Accused even corrected ASP Alvin Chua’s grammer in P18, as evidenced from editing the phrase “that happened” to “which happened”.[^178] Some of the Accused’s phrases were reproduced verbatim in P18, such as “romanced”,[^179] “shoot”, [^180] and “play”.[^181] ASP Alvin Chua did not know the Accused beforehand.[^182]

81     When ASP Alvin Chua was recording the long statements, the Accused had said that he was well enough to give the statements.[^183] The Accused also had no issues with the interpreters for the recording of the long statements.[^184]

82     ASP Alvin Chua’s evidence was fortified by the testimony of the interpreter for P18, Mdm Maria Bazid.[^185] I accepted her evidence. Mdm Maria Bazid stated that ASP Alvin Chua had asked the Accused whether he was well prior to recording P18; the Accused replied in the affirmative and appeared normal to Mdm Maria Bazid.[^186] The Accused did not object to Mdm Maria Bazid serving as the interpreter.[^187]

83     Mdm Maria Bazid testified that she had asked the Accused whether he understood the contents of P18 and he replied positively.[^188] The Accused spoke in both English and Malay when P18 was recorded.[^189] The Accused made amendments to P18 and counter-signed them.[^190] During the scene visit to the Accused’s home, the Accused was crying and asking his wife and daughter for forgiveness.[^191]

84     ASP Alvin Chua’s evidence was fortified by the testimony of the interpreter for P14 and P20, Mr Mohammad Rashikin.[^192] I accepted his evidence. Mr Mohammad Rashikin testified that the Accused understood the statements as he said okay and nodded his head; the Accused’s body language showed that he fully understood what was happening.[^193] The Accused amended P14.[^194] For P20,[^195] the Accused used the Malay words “_jilat aje. No cucuk_” which means “lick only, no poke”.[^196] During the recording of both P14 and P20, the Accused was calm, did not express any discomfort, was able to answer the questions in English and at times, he would pause to compose himself to give the best answer to the questions posed.[^197] The Accused himself admitted that P20 had been read back to him in Malay.

85     Mdm Maria Bazid and Mr Mohammad Rashikin were not cross-examined on various points that only surfaced during the Accused’s examination-in-chief during the main trial, such as:

> (a)      P14. The Accused explained that inmates in the cell had told him to just make up stories; if not, he would not be able to go home and see his family. He said that paragraphs 5 and 6 did not happen.

> (b)      P18. The Accused said that the contents of P18 were made up by him. He said that paragraph 2 did not happen.

> (c)      P20. The Accused said that the contents of P20 were made up by him, so that he can go home and meet his family. He said that paragraph 3 did not happen.

86     Oddly, the Accused did _not_ ask ASP Alvin Chua whether he could go home, even after P18 and P20 had been recorded.

87     Sixth, although Dimenate, Chlorpheniramine and Flumicil may cause mild sleepiness as their side effect,[^198] Dr Belinda Lee Wai Leng[^199] stated that the “consumption or lack of consumption of the above drugs,[^200] including Lactus, would _not_ have affected his mental capacity to give his statement to the police.” (emphasis added)[^201]

88     Once the statements are admitted, the next task is to identify the relevant admissions contained in them that support the elements of the charge: _Tan Lye Heng_ at \[70\].

89     I gave full weight to the Accused’s Contemporaneous and Cautioned Statements, where he admitted to the following (see _Tan Lye Heng_ at \[76\]):

> (a)      Contemporaneous Statement: “I wish to say that I love my granddaughter a lot. I have joke and touch (Victim’s) private part. The (Victim) is my granddaughter. I touch her vagina I used my right hand middle finger to rub and touch (Victim’s) vagina. I did not insert my finger into her vagina. I cannot remember how many times I touch her vagina. I also got licked (Victim’s) vagina 2 times. I last licked (Victim’s) vagina last Friday at 9pm at the house living room. Last Friday, (Victim) at same time at my house, (Victim) also come to me and put my penis into her mouth. She only put my penis into her mouth for 5 seconds. She did not suck my penis. I think in total, (Victim) has put my penis into her mouth for about 3 or 4 times.”[^202]

> (b)      Cautioned Statement: “I did not use force on her. She just followed what I told her to do. She asked me to just lick and no poking. She also put my penis into her mouth. That is all. I would like to apologise to my family. That is all.”[^203]

### 1st Ancillary hearing (Victim)

90      Allegation. The Victim said that she did not give the statement (Victim’s First Statement).[^204]

91     After the ancillary hearing, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Victim’s First Statement recorded on 26 September 2017 from 1.50 p.m. to 2.41 p.m. had been given by the Victim voluntarily, and admitted it into evidence.[^205] My reasons are as follows.

92     Insp Mohamad Noor testified that he saw the Victim sign at the bottom left corner of every page of the First Statement; the Victim testified that this symbol was her signature when she was young.[^206] No threat, inducement or promise was made to the Victim.[^207] During the recording of the First Statement, the Victim was spontaneous, candid, unafraid, and forthcoming.[^208] Insp Mohamad Noor spoke in Malay.[^209] The Victim spoke in a mixture of Malay and English.[^210] The English words used by the Victim were recorded by Insp Mohamad Noor.[^211]

93     After the statement was recorded, Insp Mohamad Noor read it back in English and interpreted it in Malay to the Victim, and invited her to make amendments.[^212] I accepted the evidence of Insp Mohamad Noor, which I found to be consistent and credible.

### 2nd Ancillary hearing (Victim)

94      Allegation. The Victim said that she did not give the statement (Victim’s Second Statement).[^213]

95     After the ancillary hearing, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Victim’s Second Statement recorded on 26 September 2017 from 5.30 p.m. to 5.45 p.m. had been given by the Victim voluntarily, and admitted it into evidence.[^214] My reasons are as follows.

96     ASP Alvin Chua testified that he saw the Victim use her left hand to sign on the left of the Second Statement both at the top and bottom of each page.[^215] No threat, inducement or promise was made to the Victim.[^216] During the recording of the Second Statement, the Victim was calm, composed and not in any obvious distress.[^217] She did not appear to be scared.[^218] She was bubbly, forthcoming, candid, and as relaxed as a normal eight-year old.[^219]

97     ASP Alvin Chua’s evidence was fortified by the testimony of ASP Jagathiswari d/o Jaganathan,[^220] who served as the interpreter. ASP Jagathiswari is trained to interview young sexual assault victims.[^221] She testified that she saw the Victim sign on the left of the Second Statement both at the top and bottom of each page; the Victim testified that this symbol was her signature when she was young.[^222] No threat, inducement or promise was made to the Victim.[^223] During the recording of the Second Statement, the Victim was outspoken, cheerful, bubbly, forthcoming, and able to answer the questions.[^224] The Victim was comfortable talking to the officers, fine, and cheerful.[^225]

98     After the statement was recorded, ASP Jagathiswari read it back in English and interpreted it in Malay to the Victim, and invited her to make amendments.

99     I accepted the evidence of ASP Alvin Chua and ASP Jagathiswari, which I found to be consistent and credible. For completeness, there was a photograph showing ASP Alvin Chua and ASP Jagathiswari together with the Victim on the day in question.[^226]

100    In sum, I found that the Victim’s First Statement[^227] and Second Statement[^228] were voluntarily given, and admitted them into evidence.

## Impeachment

### The Law for impeachment

101    Guidance on the scope and relevance of an impeachment exercise can be found in _Osman Bin Ramli v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 959</span> at \[29\] to \[32\]:

> (a)     First, “innocent” discrepancies must be distinguished from deliberate lies.

> (b)     Second, the credibility of a witness cannot be impeached unless there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions in her evidence. “Serious discrepancies” or “material contradictions” are those that go to the crux of the charge against the accused person.

> (c)     Third, even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it does not automatically lead to a total rejection of her evidence. The court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded.

102    The credit of the witness is impeached upon the inconsistent former statement being proved, _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[22\].

103    In the present case, the Prosecution sought to impeach the Victim’s credit on portions of her two statements to the police and her testimony in court under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act.[^229] The Prosecution succeeded in doing so. I shall analyse portions of the Victim’s statements which were highlighted by the Prosecution in court, against her testimony.

104    The Prosecution also sought to impeach the Accused’s wife’s credit on portions of her statement to the police and her testimony in court under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act. The Prosecution succeeded in doing so. I shall analyse portions of her statement which were highlighted by the Prosecution in court, against her testimony.

107    In the present case, there were serious discrepancies that went to the crux of the charges: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ at \[26\], and _Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[33\].  As seen from the above table, the Victim did not provide any explanation for many of the discrepancies, while her other answers did not make sense. In the circumstances, her credit was impeached. In my analysis of the impeachment application, I took into account the totality of the evidence tendered at trial: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ at \[21\].

### Victim’s version in court was inconsistent with documentary evidence and doctors’ testimony

108    I was aware that even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it did not automatically lead to a total rejection of her evidence; the court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded: _Osman Bin Ramli_ at \[32\].

109    In this regard, I noted that the Victim’s version in court was inconsistent with both the documentary evidence (e.g. KK Hospital’s medical documents) as well as the various doctors’ testimony in court. For instance, in contrast to the Victim’s version – _viz._ she had been warded only for itchiness in the scalp and other parts of the body and head lice and insisted that she had received daily treatment for head lice in KK Hospital, and that she did not tell the doctor that there was pain when urinating[^276] – Dr Lee Mei Sung[^277] testified that there had _not_ been any mention of head lice and itchy scalp.[^278]

110    In similar vein, Dr Seet Meei Jiun stated in a document dated 22 June 2021 that “According to the Medical Report prepared by Dr Sangrithi, there was nothing mentioned about the victim and/or her mother complaining about head lice or itchy scalp. There was also nothing mentioned about the victim or her mother complaining specifically about urinary tract infection. However, based on Dr Sangrithi’s report, he wrote “(the Victim) reported that it was painful for her to pass urine subsequently on a number of times”.[^279] Dr Yap Jia Ying Celeste[^280] also testified that from 26 September to 7 October 2017, both the Victim and her mother did not mention itchy scalp or head lice.

111    Dr Seet Meei Jiun[^281] testified that if the Victim had complained of itchy scalp or head lice, KK Hospital’s Obstetrician and Gynaecology Department would not have been activated as that was not part of their speciality.[^282]

112    For completeness, the Victim’s male cousin also testified that the Victim went for a check-up at KK Hospital because it hurt when she urinated, and not because of itchiness at her head area.[^283] In this regard, the Victim, her mother and her aunt had told the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s Child Protection Officer, Ms Zhuo Xiaojun,[^284] that the Victim had experienced pain while urinating.[^285] And the Victim had told Ms Zhuo Xiaojun on 28 September 2017 that she did not have head lice.[^286] Neither the Victim nor her mother told Dr Mahesh Sangrithi that the Victim felt itchy when passing urine.

113    Moreover, the Victim told at least 10 people in September 2017 that the Accused had sexually assaulted her. These 10 people included:

> (a)     Police officers (Station Inspector Ananth Kumar Alagiri Balasubramaniam,[^287] Insp Mohamed Salim bin Maidin,[^288] Insp Mohamad Noor, ASP Alvin Chua and ASP Jagathiswari),

> (b)     Child protection officer (Zhuo Xiaojun),

> (c)     Staff Nurse (Lai Yuan Kei) and

> (d)     Doctors (Dr Lee Mei Sung, Dr Seet Meei Jiun, and Dr Mahesh Sangrithi).

114    Station Inspector Ananth Kumar stated that the Victim, unlike other children, was very clear and very precise in answering questions.[^289] After being asked open-ended questions, she started telling him everything.[^290] The Victim was very spontaneous and spoke very well in very good English.[^291] The Victim was very protective of her younger sister and told Station Inspector Ananth Kumar that she was telling him the details of the sexual assaults because she wanted to protect her younger sister.[^292]

115    Station Inspector Ananth Kumar’s Investigation Diary stated that “Victim was together with her younger sister at the ward and interview was conducted with the presence of the Ward Nurse Ms. Lai Yuan Kei. When interviewed, victim stated that since she was in K1, her grandfather had been “disturbing” her. Victim able to precisely describe that her grandfather had several times placed his penis on her vagina and attempted to penetrate. He also had used his finger to penetrate and “play” with her vagina several times. Her grandfather would undress her naked everytime he carried out the act. He also had “licked” her vagina and asked her to hold onto his penis, which the victim did not. Her grandfather would carry out such act as and when there is no one at home and especially when her grandmother is out.”[^293]

116    Insp Mohamed Salim testified that the Victim was asked open-ended questions.[^294] She said that her grandfather sexually assaulted her and inserted his finger into her vagina.[^295] Her grandfather also touched her chest without her consent and she was uncomfortable with this.[^296] The Victim was calm and composed with no signs of distress during the interview.[^297] Insp Mohamed Salim remembered this case very clearly as cases involving sexual assault by penetration of a minor are not the norm.[^298]

117    After interviewing the Victim on 26 September 2017, both Station Inspector Ananth Kumar and Insp Mohamed Salim had no further involvement in this case.[^299]

118    Staff Nurse Lai Yuan Kei[^300] testified that the Victim told the police officers that she had been “disturbed” by the Accused when nobody was home or when her grandmother went to the market.[^301] The Accused licked her private parts, with the Victim pointing to her vagina.[^302] The Accused asked her to lick his private parts and give him oral sex.[^303] The Accused also used his finger to digitally penetrate the Victim’s vagina.[^304]

119    Staff Nurse Lai remembered the Victim as being very calm, brave and firm.[^305] She wanted the grandfather to go to jail as she did not want the same thing to happen to her younger sister.[^306] The Victim had apprised her grandmother but the grandmother told her to keep quiet.[^307] The Victim was able to answer all the questions posed by the police officers.[^308]

120    Staff Nurse Lai clearly remembered this case as the Victim’s mother had left both the Victim and her younger sister at the ward, the Victim’s mother was uncontactable and refused to be clerked, an officer had to go to the home to get the Victim’s mother’s signature, and everybody was rushing.[^309]

121    Dr Lee Mei Sung testified that it was the Victim who “complained of pain when pass urine” and who stated that she had “dysuria x 3 days” and “(symptoms of dysuria) recurred x 3 days ago”.[^310] This is consistent with Dr Celeste Yap’s Medical Report to the Police stating that the Victim “was admitted from 26 September to 7 October 2017 when she presented with 3 days of dysuria”.[^311]

122    Dr Lee Mei Sung said that the KK Hospital’s Children’s Emergency – EDR had stated that “in view of recent acute symptoms, (to) treat (the Victim’s case) as (a) (sexual assault) hot case” because Dr Lee Mei Sung had been informed that a sexual assault had taken place within the past 72 hours coupled with the fact that the Victim’s painful urination started about 3 days ago.[^312]

123    Dr Mahesh Sangrithi testified that the Victim’s mother wanted a medical check-up for the Victim as the mother was concerned that there could a tear in the Victim’s vagina.[^313] Dr Mahesh Sangrithi asked the Victim and her mother open-ended questions.[^314] There was _no_ complaint at any time of an itchy scalp or head lice.[^315] The Victim “explained that she had previously been pinned down and her clothes were removed. Penetrative intercourse had been performed on a number of occasions (bed, floor, kitchen and dining table). These had involved digital vaginal penetration. It was not clear if penile penetration was performed. (The Victim) reported that it was painful for her to pass urine subsequently on a number of times. Oral sexual contact was also reported.”[^316] Dr Mahesh Sangrithi said that periurethral redness[^317] could be caused by sexual assault due to direct contact via penile or digital contact with the Victim’s private parts.[^318]

124    The Psychological Report of the Victim,[^319] prepared by Dr Cheryl Huang Shu Hui,[^320] stated that “There were also instances where (the Victim’s mother) provided inaccurate information to (the Victim). For example, (the Victim’s mother) reported that when (the Victim) was admitted into KKH as a place of safety, she affirmed (the Victim’s) belief that (the Victim) was admitted for head lice as (the Victim’s mother) was unable to provide other explanations.”[^321]

125    To be sure, the Defence produced a letter from National University Polyclinics indicating that the Victim had visited Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic for complaints of head lice.[^322] But I observed that the dates that she had visited Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic were 20 September 2017 and 11 October 2017, which were different dates from her stay at KK Hospital.

126    For completeness, the Victim testified that she had never entered her grandparents’ room.[^323] This was because her grandmother did not allow her to enter that bedroom[^324] and the Victim did not think that it was respectful to do so.[^325] The Victim said that the Accused had bathed her and helped her to wear diapers when she was younger.[^326] The Victim also said that she was not at the Accused’s home on 24 September 2017 as she had moved to her aunt’s home on 23 September 2017, and that there had not been a meeting at a park in 2017.[^327]

127    However, the Victim was not a credible witness in court, as seen from the following examples:

> (a)     Even though her mother worked from 11a.m. to 9p.m. in June, July, August and most of September 2017, the Victim insisted that her mother had fetched her from school daily at about 6p.m..[^328] In this regard, the Victim’s mother herself had told the Child Protection Officer, Ms Zhuo Xiaojun, that until her café job (11a.m. to 9p.m.) she had been working mainly night shifts.[^329] When the Victim’s mother worked night shifts, the Victim’s grandmother took care of the Victim at night.[^330]

> (b)     The Victim claimed that from 2015 to 2017, she had never slept past 8.30p.m., i.e. not even on a single occasion.[^331] However, the Victim’s grandmother testified that the Victim sometimes slept at 11pm or 12 midnight when there was no school the next day.

> (c)     The Victim said that she decided on a permanent move to her aunt’s home on 23 September 2017 as there were many cousins for her to play with there.[^332] However, given that she had left her school uniform and school bag at the Accused’s flat (as seen from P19 at photographs 38-39, which was taken on 28 September 2017),[^333] I was not able to accept the Victim’s claim. My view is fortified by:

>> (i)       The evidence of the Child Protection Officer, Ms Zhuo Xiaojun, who stated that at the Accused’s flat on 29 September 2017, the Victim’s mother had informed her that she and her two children are staying in a room in the Accused’s flat with the Victim’s grandmother looking after the two children when the Victim’s mother worked;[^334] and

>> (ii)       The fact that the Victim’s grandmother testified that the Victim only moved out of the Accused’s flat when she took away essential items such as her school uniform, school bag and books,[^335] and that the Victim only moved out of the flat after she had been admitted to KK Hospital.[^336]

> (d)     The Victim said that she attended student care every day from June to September 2017. But the attendance records showed that she was absent on the following dates in 2017: 5-9 June, 12-14 June, 16 June, 20 June, 3 July, 10 August, 29 August, and 4-8 September 2017.[^337]

> (e)     The Child Abuse Protection Team Meeting Report stated that the Victim “had similarly informed (her grandmother) and another maternal aunt about the incidents”.[^338] The Child Protection Officer, Ms Zhuo Xiaojun, stated that this information came from the Victim and her mother.[^339] In similar vein, the Victim’s mother told Dr Mahesh Sangrithi that “such events had previously also been highlighted to (the Victim’s) maternal grandmother by (the Victim) herself – however no action had been taken to date”.[^340]

128    Ms Zhuo Xiaojun had interviewed the Victim, her younger sister, her mother, her aunt and her grandmother. Ms Zhuo Xiaojun asked them open-ended questions to facilitate their sharing of information with her freely, and she took verbatim notes concurrently during these interviews.[^341]

129    The Victim told Ms Zhuo Xiaojun that the Accused had disturbed her when nobody was at home, and he touched her private parts and kissed her mouth when she was 6 to 8 years old. Her male cousin had witnessed it when the door was opened. The Accused had hugged the Victim, and went on top of her until she sometimes could not breathe and told him to stop. The Accused had placed his genitals on her genital area, and also put his finger inside her vagina albeit not so deeply. The Victim stated that the Accused had molested her. The Accused told her that it was a secret between them; the Victim’s sister saw what happened and the Accused similarly told her that it was a secret.[^342]

130    The Psychological Report of the Victim[^343] stated that “after Dr (Cheryl) Huang[^344] expressed knowledge about the alleged sexual abuse, (the Victim) became teary, noting that her mother, maternal grandmother and maternal aunt had told her not to talk about it. Thereafter, she declined to talk about the allegations.”[^345] Beneath the Victim’s carapace was a palpable sense of sadness.

131    Additionally, the Psychological Report of the Victim[^346] stated that “(the Victim) acknowledged that the alleged sexual abuse made her afraid. However, her tearful presentation when she disclosed that (her mother), her maternal grandmother and her maternal aunt had asked her not to discuss the allegations appeared to be due to concerns about upsetting them…. In addition, (the Victim) expressed concerns about being removed from (her mother’s) care for _lying to the police because she recanted her statement_” (emphasis added).[^347]

132    The Prosecution applied successfully to admit both of the Victim’s statements as substantive evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. Having regard to the Court of Appeal’s guidance in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_ for the factors listed under s 147(6) of the Evidence Act, I gave full weight to the Victim’s First Statement[^348] and Second Statement[^349].[^350]

133    For completeness, I placed no weight on the Victim’s further statement (D12).[^351]

135    In the present case, there were serious discrepancies that went to the crux of the charges: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ at \[26\], and _Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar_ at \[33\].  As seen from the above table, the Accused’s wife’s either did not provide any reasonable explanation for the discrepancies or said that she could not remember. In the circumstances, her credit was impeached. In my analysis of the impeachment application, I took into account the totality of the evidence tendered at trial: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ at \[21\].

136    I was aware that even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it did not automatically lead to a total rejection of her evidence; the court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded: _Osman Bin Ramli_ at \[32\]. In this regard, I accepted certain parts of the Accused’s wife’s testimony as true, as detailed in this judgement. However, in general, as she tailored her testimony to support her husband’s case, I found her to be an untruthful witness.

137    For completeness, I also found the Victim’s aunt to be an untruthful witness. She was so eager to support the Accused’s case that she answered even _before_ the questions had been asked by the Defence Counsel:[^367]

## Charges

### 1st charge

#### (a)   Occupants of the Accused’s home

138    The Defence stated that many people were staying at the Accused’s home, including the Accused, his wife, 4 grandchildren (including the Victim), and the Victim’s mother.[^368] However, to my mind, they were located at different parts of the home. And they were not all present at home. For example, when the Victim’s male cousin[^369] was in secondary school, he would be in school from 8a.m. to 1.30p.m. or 4p.m., and he would be in school on Fridays for co-curricular activities until 6p.m..[^370] The Victim’s female cousin shuttled between staying at the Accused’s home and her mother’s home.[^371] The Victim’s mother and grandmother were not always at home.[^372]

#### (b)   Male cousin witnessed the 2015 incident

139    The Accused claimed that for the incident in 2015, he had wanted to take his handphone in the master bedroom.[^373] As the Victim and her sister were holding onto his handphone, he grabbed his handphone from them.[^374] The Accused did not know who else was behind him who entered the master bedroom.[^375] The Accused then went to the washroom.[^376] For most of his court testimony, the Accused then denied that the incident in 2015 had taken place.

140    Importantly, the Victim’s male cousin testified that he was an eye-witness to what had taken place in 2015. For this incident, his grandmother was praying in the living room, where she could not see the Accused’s bedroom;[^377] his grandmother confirmed in court that from where she prayed, she could not see the Accused’s bedroom.[^378] After returning from school, the Victim’s male cousin opened the master bedroom door; this was corroborated by his grandmother when she testified in court.[^379] He saw that the Accused and Victim were both fully naked.[^380] He was standing about 1 metre away from the Accused.[^381] Given the lights in both the master bedroom and washroom, he had a clear and unblocked view of the Accused and the Victim.[^382]

141    He disagreed with the Defence’s position that the Accused had been wearing an ankle-length _sarong_ or that the Accused had bathed or was about to bathe the Victim (_viz._ the Victim either bathed herself or was bathed by her own mother).[^383] When the Accused testified during the main trial, it was telling that in describing the clothes that he wore at home – long pants with T-shirt, shorts without a shirt, and long gown or _gamis_ when he was performing his prayers[^384] – he did not mention _sarong_.[^385] For completeness, the Victim’s younger sister had told the Child Protection Officer, Ms Zhuo Xiaojun,[^386] that the Accused had never showered her.[^387] Similarly, the Victim’s grandmother testified that the Accused had never bathed the Victim.[^388]

142    The Victim’s sister was fully clothed and staring at what the Accused was doing to the Victim.[^389] The Victim was lying on the bed with her legs dangling from the bed.[^390] The Victim was facing upwards and watching something on the tablet.[^391] The Accused was kneeling with one leg.[^392] His body was bent forward and a bit hunched.[^393] The Accused used his left hand to support himself and his right hand was holding his genitals.[^394] The Accused’s head was between the Victim’s thighs and going up and down near the Victim’s genitals, akin to a ‘nodding’ action.[^395] There was no space between the Accused’s face and the Victim’s genitals.[^396] The Accused was licking the Victim’s vagina.[^397]

143    When the Victim’s male cousin saw this, he was shocked and it took him 2 to 3 seconds to say that he was home. [^398] Upon hearing this, the Accused looked stunned, covered his crotch area with both hands and ran to the washroom.[^399] As regards the Accused going into the bathroom, this was consistent with the Accused’s own evidence.[^400] The Victim’s male cousin then asked the Victim and her sister to return to their room.[^401] The Victim’s male cousin was traumatised and in disbelief at what he had seen the Accused do; he needed to clear his mind and thus left the home for about an hour’s walk before returning at around 9p.m..[^402] He ‘locked’ his door by placing a towel across his room door and refused to speak to his grandfather.[^403]

144    The next day or two days later, he told his grandmother a summary of what he had witnessed in relation to the Accused and the Victim.[^404] After hearing his account, his grandmother was taken aback and kept quiet.[^405] His grandmother said that she knew that there was something wrong with the Accused’s mindset;[^406] this was corroborated by his grandmother’s court testimony.[^407] His grandmother also testified that he had informed her that the Accused had done something inappropriate to the Victim.[^408]

145    I accepted the Victim’s male cousin’s testimony. Prior to this incident, he was very close to the Accused and viewed his grandfather as a father figure.[^409] In court, his grandmother agreed that he viewed his grandfather as his father figure, and the grandfather and grandson had a good relationship before 2015. Since birth, he had been brought up under the Accused’s aegis.[^410] The Victim’s male cousin disagreed with the Defence’s position that he was unhappy with being reprimanded by the Accused for his school performance and association with certain friends.[^411] He explained that his drug use took place in 2019, which stemmed from being traumatised by what he had seen the Accused do to the Victim and feeling distant from his father figure cum teacher.[^412] He felt like he had lost something and been betrayed by someone he trusted.[^413] He was candid in saying that he was not happy with the Accused for kicking him out of the home, although he moved back to stay together with the Accused.[^414] He was balanced in his testimony and said that what the Accused did to the Victim was “out of character” and commended him for being a good grandfather and father.[^415]

146    The 1st charge is supported by the Accused’s own statements/ psychiatric report:

> (a)      Cautioned Statement: “I did not use force on her. She just followed what I told her to do. She asked me to just lick and no poking…. That is all. I would like to apologise to my family. That is all.”[^416]

> (b)      Accused’s long statement (P18): “Yes I remember now. It happened about two years ago. (The Victim, her sister) and myself were on the bed in my bedroom. I removed my clothing and (the Victim) removed her own clothing by herself. We hugged each other on the bed and (the Victim’s sister) was seated on a pillow on the bed. We ‘romanced’ each other on the bed by kissing each other on the lips and cheeks. I laid on top of (the Victim) and pressed my penis against (the Victim’s) vagina. I pressed my penis a few times (skin-on-skin) until I ‘shoot’ my sperms on the bed. When I was doing so, I heard someone entering the room. I am unsure if it that was (the Victim’s male cousin).”[^417]

> (c)      Accused’s long statement (P20): he admitted to licking the Victim’s vagina[^418] and stated that the Victim “was lying on the mattress of the bed. I was standing by the side of the bed. I bent forward and licked her vagina once.”[^419]

> (d)      Accused’s psychiatric report (P3):

>> (i)        Paragraph 20. “On a day in 2015, he saw the Victim who had just come out of the shower naked again. He said that ‘maybe I could not control myself’. He said he was topless at that time and was just wearing his shorts. His wife was in the kitchen and they were not in her line of sight. He shared that he had grabbed the Victim, brought her to his bedroom, and hugged her on the bed. He described that he was on top of her while hugging her, with ‘skin to skin’ contact.”[^420]

>> (ii)        Paragraph 21. “He said that his penis was touching the Victim’s vagina and he felt sexually aroused and ‘steam’. In his own words, ‘that time I play with (the Victim), my penis stand. Her vagina looked like adult, plus she was naked, and showed her buttocks’. He said that due to the contact of his penis to the outside of the Victim’s vagina, he ejaculated outside of her vagina. He maintained that he did not masturbate and the semen ‘leaked out by itself’.”[^421]

>> (iii)        Paragraph 22. “… he admitted to licking her vagina 2 times …”.[^422]

>> (iv)        Paragraph 24. “He stated that during this whole time, the Victim did not resist or voice any displeasure. He stated that ‘it feel like she giving me permission’.”[^423]

>> (v)        Paragraph 25. “He vaguely recalls someone entering the room while he was with the Victim. He appeared to be unsure who it was, at first saying that it could be his grandson, or his wife. He said that by then, he has ‘finished’ and was going to clean himself up in the bathroom. He stated that if someone had entered his room while he was licking her vagina, he would have stopped immediately because ‘it is no good for old man to do this’. He also stated that he would not have grabbed the Victim to his bedroom if his wife had been next to him.”[^424]

>> (vi)        Paragraph 26. “According to him, the incident described above was the first time he had sexual contact with the Victim… He said that he had tried to control himself because ‘I felt guilty, I felt scared. If anyone report, I get into trouble’.”[^425]

147    The 1st charge was also supported by what the Victim had told the police, amongst others:

> (a)     In the Victim’s First Statement, referring to the Accused, she stated that “Tok Wan lick my vagina (recorder’s note: pepeh)… “He put his “bird bird” on my vagina.”[^426]

> (b)     The Child Abuse Protection Team Meeting Report stated that the Accused “had also performed oral sex on (the Victim) on several occasions, despite (the grandmother’s) and (the Victim’s sister’s) presence at home”.[^427]

148    ASP Alvin Chua explained that he did not verify whether the Accused’s sperm was on the bed, as such verification would be inconclusive as both the Accused and his wife used that bed and the event had taken place 2 years ago.[^428] I found this to be a reasonable explanation.

149    The Defence intimated that just as the Accused lied about the Victim pushing her vagina against his big toe,[^429] he was also lying about other parts of his statements. ASP Alvin Chua was alive to the fact that the “vagina against big toe” story was unlikely to be true, as he had described it as being an “incredulous account”.[^430] ASP Alvin Chua explained that the Accused may have given such an account to explain away the possible hymenal tears (at that stage of the statement-recording, the Accused did not know the results of the Victim’s medical examination and he may have thought that the Victim suffered from hymenal tears).[^431]

150    For completeness, the Defence emphasised that there was no disruption or tears in the Victim’s hymen.[^432] However, that point is neither here nor there as Dr Seet Meei Jiun had testified that a hymen is generally quite accommodating and even in certain cases of penile-vaginal or digital penetration, there may not be any tears in the hymen at all.[^433] Dr Mahesh Sangrithi also testified that the lack of a hymenal tear does not mean conclusively that the vagina had not been digitally penetrated.[^434]

### 2nd charge

151    In his cautioned statement, the Accused stated that “Whatever I have said did not happen. It was just my imagination. I was just telling stories. There are so many people in my house, I wouldn’t have been able to do it. If I don’t tell such stories, I wouldn’t have met my family members. I was confused, nervous and scared when I was at Cantonment lock-up because it was my first experience. I was advised by the cell-mates in the lock-up to say such stories. So I did not do the offence.”[^435]

152    The Accused was at home in the morning on 24 September 2017 before he left the carpark at 9.47a.m.[^436]

#### (a)   Date that the Victim moved out of the Accused’s home

153    The Defence stated that since 21, 22 or 23 September 2017, the Victim, her sister, and her mother did not return to the Accused’s home.[^437] Hence, the Victim could not have been at the Accused’s home on 24 September 2017.[^438]

154    However, ASP Alvin Chua testified that the Accused did not say this during interviews or during the recording of his statements; ASP Alvin Chua stated that he only heard about this in the Case for the Defence in 2020, _viz._ almost at the beginning of the trial before it was postponed because of the pandemic.[^439] And there was no mention in any of the Accused’s ten police statements that the Victim had shifted out of the Accused’s house since 21, 22 or 23 September 2017. The Accused also did not inform Dr Hatta Santoso Ong of this.[^440]

155    In addition, on 26 September 2017, Dr Lee Mei Sung had been informed that the Victim was “staying with grandparents”.[^441] The Victim’s mother also informed Dr Mahesh Sangrithi that her home address was in Choa Chu Kang, _viz._ the Accused’s home.[^442]

156    The Child Protection Officer, Ms Zhuo Xiaojun, testified that at the Accused’s flat on 29 September 2017, the Victim’s mother had informed her that she and her two children are staying in a room in the Accused’s flat with the Victim’s grandmother looking after the two children when the Victim’s mother worked.[^443] And Ms Zhuo Xiaojun testified that as the Accused was released on bail on 17 October 2017, the Victim moved into her aunt’s home on 16 October 2017,[^444] while the Victim’s mother and sister moved into her aunt’s home on 17 October 2017.[^445] This was fortified by the Immediate Safety Plan Template (6 October 2017),[^446] which stated that “If the maternal grandfather is released from remand, (the Victim’s mother) _will_ move in with (the Victim’s aunt) and the children” (italics added).

157    I did not accept the Victim’s mother’s claim that she had moved out of the Accused’s flat on 21 September 2017 because she did not want her parents to find out that she had lost her job.[^447] This was because she had remained in the flat despite been unemployed on two previous occasions from February 2015 to June 2016 and from February to April 2017.[^448] Her reason that she could not pay her parents their monthly maintenance rang hollow because her salary was disbursed on 6 October 2017.[^449] And her claim that despite having head lice, the Victim had stayed at the Victim’s aunt’s residence was a non-sequitur because she was on medical leave for a contagious illness and should remain at home instead of infecting her cousins.[^450]

158    Furthermore, the Victim had left her school uniform and school bag at the Accused’s flat (as seen from P19 at photographs 38-39, which was taken on 28 September 2017);[^451] the Accused’s wife testified that the Victim only moved out of the Accused’s flat when she took away essential items such as her school uniform, bags and books.[^452] And the Accused’s wife testified that the Victim only moved out of the flat after she had been admitted to KK Hospital.[^453] In the circumstances, I found the Accused’s version to be an afterthought.

159    The Victim’s mother was also not a credible witness in court. The Victim’s mother had testified that she had moved to her sister’s home on 21 September 2017, and she had brought the Victim and her sister out on 21 September 2017 and spent the entire day with them.[^454] However, this was inconsistent with the café’s records that showed that she had worked that day from 11.08 a.m. to 9.22p.m..[^455] The café did not allow employees to bring their children to the workplace.[^456] For completeness, before working at the café, she had worked at a bar that also did not allow her to bring children to the workplace.[^457]

160    The 2nd charge is supported by the Accused’s own statements:

> (a)      Contemporaneous Statement: “… (Victim) also come to me and put my penis into her mouth. She only put my penis into her mouth for 5 seconds. She did not suck my penis. I think in total, (Victim) has put my penis into her mouth for about 3 or 4 times.”[^458]

> (b)      Cautioned Statement: “…She also put my penis into her mouth. That is all. I would like to apologise to my family. That is all.”[^459]

> (c)      Accused’s long statement (P14): “We were actually seated on the sofa and watching TV in the hall and her younger sister was also in the hall. (The Victim) then came over from my right side and stood in front of me before taking my penis and putting it into her mouth. She moved her head up and down once without her lips in contact with my penis. My penis was inside her mouth but I did not feel her lips on my penis.”[^460] and “I went back to my seated position and (the Victim) came to me. She unzipped my pants and I pulled down my underwear. She took out my penis and put it inside her mouth for a few seconds. She did not close her mouth on my penis. I was not fully erected although I was slightly aroused.”[^461]

> (c)      Accused’s long statement (P20): “I pulled down my own underwear and (Victim) took out my penis. She held my penis into her mouth for a few seconds. When I saw that she wanted to close her mouth on my penis, I backed away as I knew it was a bad thing.”[^462]

161    The 2nd charge is also supported by what the Victim told Staff Nurse Lai Yuan Kei, _viz._ the Accused asked her to lick his private parts and give him oral sex.[^463]

#### (b)   Urology report of the Accused

162    For completeness, the Accused’s medical report (urology) dated 1 February 2018 by Dr Ng Kok Kit[^464] stated that “although the patient claimed that he had erectile dysfunction and was unable to have penetrative sexual intercourse if unassisted, a rigid erection was elicited during colour doppler ultrasound examination which also showed no vasculogenic erectile dysfunction. Endocrine tests also did not show any hormonal cause for erectile dysfunction”. Dr Ng Kok Kit testified that “penetrative sexual intercourse” refers only to penile-vaginal intercourse, and that the mouth is a much wider cavity so there is virtually no resistance to penetration.[^465] Dr Ng Kok Kit also stated that the Accused’s erection is probably poor but in certain occasions he may have an erection of sufficient stiffness some of the time.[^466]

### 3rd charge

163    In his cautioned statement, the Accused stated that “It’s the same as what I said in the 2nd charge. I wouldn’t do this to my own granddaughter. I did not do it, that’s why I do not admit. I was just telling stories.”[^467]

164    The Defence contended that it was not possible for the Accused to kneel on the floor and lick the Victim’s vagina because of the coffee table (see P19 at photograph 12).[^468] However, ASP Alvin Chua replied that the sofa and coffee table are all movable items.[^469] I found ASP Alvin Chua’s answer to be reasonable and noted that there was ample space in the living room. My view is fortified by the fact that the Accused’s wife testified that she would shift the coffee table whenever she prayed.[^470]

165    The Defence stated that the hall is visible from the kitchen. ASP Alvin Chua stated that this would depend on where the person is located in relation to the kitchen.[^471] This explanation makes sense, for example, ASP Alvin Chua pointed out that one cannot see the sofa from the kitchen (P19 at photograph 8).[^472] This is broadly consistent with the evidence of the Victim’s grandmother.[^473] It is also consistent with the Victim’s male cousin’s evidence that one cannot see who was sitting at the sofa or what was happening there from the kitchen.[^474]

166    The 3rd charge is supported by the Accused’s own statements/ psychiatric report:

> (a)      Contemporaneous Statement: “I wish to say that I love my granddaughter a lot. I have joke and touch (Victim’s) private part. The (Victim) is my granddaughter. I touch her vagina I used my right hand middle finger to rub and touch (Victim’s) vagina. I did not insert my finger into her vagina. I cannot remember how many times I touch her vagina. I also got licked (Victim’s) vagina 2 times. I last licked (Victim’s) vagina last Friday at 9pm at the house living room…”.[^475]

> (b)      Cautioned Statement: “I did not use force on her. She just followed what I told her to do. She asked me to just lick and no poking… That is all. I would like to apologise to my family. That is all.”[^476]

> (c)      Accused’s long statement (P14): “… I was playing and kidding around with (the Victim) in the hall area at home. We went overboard and accidentally touched each other’s genitals. After the initial accidental contact, I went on to touch (the Victim’s) vagina and licked her vagina. After licking her vagina, I used my right hand middle finger to rub her vagina. We were actually seated on the sofa and watching TV in the hall and her younger sister was also in the hall ... She went back to sitting on my right side and I continued rubbing her vagina for a while. I touched the vagina area gently in circular motion but did not put it into her vagina. I stopped after a while. My wife was in her room and so was (the Victim’s mother). There were also two other grandchildren in the bedroom”[^477]

> (d)      Accused’s long statement (P14): “I started with massaging her legs, and (the Victim) also massaged my legs. I started first by pulling up her top and massaged her stomach in circular motion. I slowly put my right hand into her trousers from the waist level. She had her panty on. I slipped my hand into her vagina and used my right middle finger to touch her vagina. She did not stop me and she herself pulled down her trousers further and asked me to lick her vagina but I cannot poke my finger inside. I moved over to her side and she was still seated on the sofa. I kneeled down in front of her and I moved my head forward and licked her vagina. She opened her legs for me and I just rested both my hands on the sofa cushion by her sides. I licked her vagina twice and pulled her trousers back up. I did not want to go too far as it is not good.”[^478]

> (e)      Accused’s long statement (P20): “After a while I put my hand into her trousers from the waist level and moved my hand to her vagina and touched it using my right middle finger… I moved over to her side and she was still seated on the sofa. I kneeled down in front of her and moved my head forward to lick her vagina twice. She had pulled down her trousers halfway down together with her panty, exposing her vagina. I licked upwards with my tongue twice. I did not hold her as I was holding on to the tablet at first before I rested my hands on the sofa cushion. It was a very fast action as I know it was not a good thing to do.”[^479]

> (f)      Accused’s psychiatric report (P3): “On 24 September 2017, he said that he licked the Victim’s vagina again. After that, she was brought to Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH) for a medical checkup, where his actions were brought to light.”[^480]

167    The 3rd charge is also supported by what the Victim told the police, amongst others:

> (a)     In the Victim’s First Statement, referring to the Accused, she stated that “Tok Wan lick my vagina (recorder’s note: pepeh), he put his hand on my vagina.”[^481]

> (b)     The Child Abuse Protection Team Meeting Report stated that “It was reported that since approximately 2015, when (the Accused) showered (the Victim), he rubbed her vagina and inserted his finger into her vagina. (The Accused) had also performed oral sex on (the Victim) on several occasions, despite (the grandmother’s) and (the Victim’s sister’s) presence at home. (The Accused) had also requested for (the Victim) to perform oral sex on him, but (the Victim) rejected the request. As a result of the incidents, (the Victim) reported feeling scared of (the Accused) and hoped that he could be incarcerated. (The Victim’s sister) also reported feeling scared as a result of witnessing (the Accused) perpetuating on (the Victim).”[^482]

### 4th charge

168    In his cautioned statement, the Accused stated that “I did not do anything to her in 2015. (The Victim) was under the care of her mother for 24 hours. At that point of time, she was still wearing pampers. I did not have time in 2015 to interact with (the Victim). I was with my wife 24 hours in 2015. I go to work in the morning and return home late at night. Moreover, the children are in school and only return home late.”[^483]

169    The 4th charge is supported by the Accused’s own statements:

> (a)      Accused’s long statement (P14): “It was about 2 years ago, in 2015. It was inside my room which is the master bedroom. We were playing and kidding around on the bed. I touched her vagina from outside her clothes. She had my wife’s tablet and we were watching cartoons on it. Her younger sister was also around in the room. I was holding up the tablet and (the Victim) laid on my chest. (The Victim’s sister) was lying at my side. The three of us were watching the tablet. After sometime my wife called us out for meals and we left the room. Nothing else happened.”[^484]

> (b)      Accused’s long statement (P14): “... I just pressed my penis on her vagina through clothing when we were playing around. She did to me and I did back to her.”[^485]

> (c)      Accused’s long statement (P18): “We were watching cartoon on my wife’s tablet and I touched (the Victim’s) vagina from outside her clothes. It happened two years ago when (the Victim) was about six years old.”[^486] For completeness, the Accused’s wife testified that her tablet had been used by the Victim and her sister to watch cartoons.[^487]

170    The 4th charge is also supported by what the Victim told the police. In the Victim’s First Statement, referring to the Accused, she stated that “… he put his hand on my vagina.”[^488]

171    The Prosecution disagreed with the Defence that the Victim wore diapers in 2015. This point was not found in the Accused’s long statements despite them containing other exculpatory portions.

### 5th charge

#### (a)   Whether the Accused lay on top of the Victim

172    In his cautioned statement, the Accused stated that “I never lie on top of her in 2017. They didn’t even state the exact date. It is definitely not me because I did not have time to lie on top of her. There are so many people at my house and the specific time was also not written in the charge. Same as what I said in my 4th charge, I am constantly working from morning till night.”[^489]

173    The Defence stated that based on the Accused’s build and size, it would not have been possible for the Accused to have gone on top of the Victim as she would not be able to withstand the pain and she would have screamed.[^490]

174    To my mind, the Accused did lie on top of the Victim. The Accused admitted to this in his long statement (P18), where he stated that “It happened sometime in mid-July 2017. (The Victim) was lying on the massage bed. Actually my grandson sleeps on that bed. At the time, my wife, my (daughter) and 3 other grandchildren were at home. (The Victim) was watching TV whilst lying on the massage bed. I went up and stood beside her. Then I decided to climb on top of the bed and laid on top of (the Victim) for a few minutes before she told me to stop. We were fully clothed.”[^491] While the Accused claimed that he “was just kidding and ‘play play’ with her”,[^492] I did not accept his explanation as he had admitted that he was lying on top of the Victim for “a few minutes before she told (him) to stop”.

175    I accepted that with the Accused lying on top of the Victim, she may have experienced some discomfort in breathing. This would explain why Dr Mahesh Sangrithi, in his medical report on the Victim dated 19 October 2017, stated that “It was described that the perpetrator would li(e) on top of the victim and that she had experienced difficulties in breathing on some occasion.”[^493]

176    The Victim’s student care attendance records showed that she was absent on the following dates in June and July 2017: 5-9 June, 12-14 June, 16 June, 20 June, and 3 July 2017.[^494]

### 6th charge

#### (a)   Working hours of the Accused

177    In his cautioned statement, the Accused stated that “As I have said in my 5th charge, I am constantly working as a company driver in a Japanese firm. Even Saturday, Sunday, I am working. I did not do all those things. There was no specific date written on the charge – I have no time to do these offences.”[^495]

178    The Defence stated that the Accused was working full-time as a chauffeur, the Victim would have been in school in July, and the Accused’s wife was always at home as she is a housewife.[^496] ASP Alvin Chua said that a housewife does not always stay at home,[^497] which I found to be a reasonable point; for example, Staff Nurse Lai Yuan Kei[^498] testified that the Victim had said that the grandfather “disturbed” her when the Accused’s wife went to the market.[^499]

179    The Victim’s male cousin pointed out that the Accused worked office hours until about 5p.m. or 6p.m., although he sometimes worked overtime and during weekends.[^500] In this regard, the Accused’s wife had told the Child Protection Officer, Ms Zhuo Xiaojun, that the Accused worked on weekdays from 7a.m. to 6p.m. with occasional overtime work until 10p.m., and he did not work on weekends.[^501] Contrary to the Accused’s claim that he went on golfing trips thrice each month from 2015-2017,[^502] the truth is that he rarely left Singapore, as seen from his travel movement records from Singapore’s Immigration & Checkpoints Authority.[^503] The Victim’s mother told Ms Zhuo Xiaojun that the Accused and his wife took care of the Victim and her sister on weekends.[^504]

180    For completeness, the Accused’s wife said that she would _usually_ stay up until the Accused comes home, but the word “usually” showed that she did not always do so.[^505]

181    The 6th charge is supported by the Accused’s own statements:

> (a)      Accused’s long statement (P18): “I think it was sometime between June to July this year. It was before the incident on the massage bed. I was playing catching with (the Victim and her sister) in the house. (The Victim’s sister) ran into the toilet whilst (the Victim) ran into the kitchen. I caught hold of (the Victim) and hugged her from behind. She turned to face me and both of us fell onto the floor by accident. I laid on top of (the Victim) when we fell and I kissed her on both side of her cheeks. I did not touch anywhere else.”[^506]

> (b)      Accused’s long statement (P20): “Once I could recall was at the kitchen when I was playing catching with (Victim and her sister). Other than lying on top of her and kissing her as I described, she unzipped my pants and took out my penis and smeared it on her mouth area. But she did not suck for me.”[^507] and “I feel shame of my behaviour. I feel very shameful towards my family members, especially to (the Victim). I will never do it again. I hope to get a lighter punishment if I am found guilty. Thank you SPF for the assistance.”[^508]

182    The Victim’s student care attendance records showed that she was absent on the following dates in June and July 2017: 5-9 June, 12-14 June, 16 June, 20 June, and 3 July 2017.[^509]

### Family meeting in the park

183    The Victim’s male cousin apprised the Victim’s mother in September 2017,[^510]_viz._ a few days before 26 September 2017.[^511] The Victim’s mother then had a meeting with two other sisters at a park at about 10 or 11 p.m., together with the Victim and her male cousin.[^512] The Victim told them what had happened.[^513] The women were angry and unhappy with what had happened and they were crying.[^514] A police report was later lodged against the Accused.[^515]

184    In court, the Victim’s mother testified that the Victim’s male and female cousins had informed her of the assault on the Victim which had prompted the Victim’s mother to take action.[^516]

185    The Victim’s mother brought her daughters away from the Accused’s home to Bukit Panjang (the Victim’s aunt’s home) so that the Accused could no longer outrage the Victim’s modesty.[^517] Since then, the Victim and her mother have not moved back to the Accused’s home.

## Accused was not a credible witness in court

186    The Accused was not a credible witness in court, as seen from the following examples:

> (a)     The Accused testified that he did not drive the Victim and her sister to SGH from 21-24 September 2017. However, this was inconsistent with his own Case for the Defence at paragraph 6: “On 22 September 2017, (the Accused) drove (the Victim, her mother and sister) to Singapore General Hospital to visit (the Accused’s son-in-law), who had been admitted into Intensive Care Unit”.[^518]

> (b)     The Accused testified that he did not meet the Victim and her sister at SGH on 24 September 2017.[^519] However, this was inconsistent with the Accused’s earlier court testimony.[^520] And it also did not sit well with the documentary evidence, _viz._ the SGH visitor details[^521] and the SGH Ward Visitation Report[^522], which showed that the Accused and the Victim had entered and exited SGH on 24 September 2017 at the same time.

> (c)     The Accused said that he had never watched television with the Victim.[^523] However, referring to the Victim, her sister and himself, the Accused agreed that the following sentence in his police statement was accurate: “We were watching TV”.[^524]

> (d)     The Accused testified that he had never bathed the Victim or her sister, and that he had also never helped them either before or after a bath.[^525] However, this was contrary to the instructions that he had given his defence counsel when cross-examining the Victim’s male cousin.[^526]

> (e)     The Accused testified that on weekdays, he would leave home at 7a.m. and sometimes return at about 9p.m. to midnight; he worked overtime every weekday.[^527] He also said that he did not return home during office hours, and that he worked almost every weekend from about 6a.m. to 10p.m. or 11p.m. and some public holidays.[^528] However, his embroidered testimony was inconsistent with the documentary evidence,[^529]_viz._ the carpark records (Movement Transaction Enquiry)[^530] and the Accused’s company’s overtime pay records.[^531] Furthermore, the Accused’s wife testified that he would sometimes return home for lunch on weekdays and he usually did not work on weekends.[^532]

> (f)     The Accused gave several conflicting versions as regards his activities on 23 September 2017,[^533] which were contradicted by the documentary evidence, _viz._ the SGH visitor details,[^534] carpark records (Movement Transaction Enquiry)[^535] and the Accused’s company’s overtime pay records.[^536]

187    For completeness, the Accused testified that he had told ASP Alvin Chua during the scene visit that something had happened between the Victim and him at the sofa chairs in the living room,[^537] the massage bed,[^538] and on the bed in the master bedroom.[^539] The Accused agreed that the fan and the table in the master bedroom are movable.[^540]

## Whether an inmate told the Accused to make up stories

188    It is difficult to believe that the Accused had been told by an inmate to make up stories so that he would be able to go home and see his family.[^541] It was implausible that based solely on a brief conversation with a stranger, the Accused would fashion, formulate and particularise a detailed account containing both inculpatory and exculpatory portions to various police officers and an IMH psychiatrist, Dr Hatta Santoso Ong.[^542]

189    The Accused’s allegation that he had been told by an inmate to make up stories was unsupported by any other evidence. There was no mention of this in the Case for his Defence.[^543] He did not complain about anything to any of the other police officers, including the lock-up officers.[^544] He did not complain about anything to the interpreters, Mr Mohammad Rashikin and Mdm Maria Bazid. He did not complain about anything to Dr Yak Si Mian, Dr Hatta Santoso Ong, and Dr Lin Hanjie.[^545] And the Accused also did not complain about anything to the nurses.[^546]

190    Contrary to the Accused’s claim that he had been sad, scared and stressed at that time,[^547] his psychiatric report stated that he “was not anxious or depressed, and his affect was reactive and appropriate”.[^548] Furthermore, the nurses did not observe any abnormalities in his mental state or behaviour throughout the remand period.[^549]

191    Notably, even _after_ P18 and P20 had been recorded, the Accused did _not_ ask ASP Alvin Chua – whom he had described as a kind person[^550] – whether he could go home.[^551]

192    Finally, all the Accused’s statements contained exculpatory portions:

> (a)      Contemporaneous Statement. “I did not insert my finger into her vagina … She did not suck my penis”.[^552]

> (b)      Cautioned Statement. “I did not use force on her…”.[^553]

> (c)      P14.

>> Q    Have you ever put your penis into (the Victim’s) vagina?

>> A    Never. Even for finger also never. I just rubbed outside.[^554]

>> …

>> Q    Besides engaging in sexual acts with (the Victim), have you ever done any similar acts with any other child/ person?

>> A    No.[^555]

> (d)      P18.

>> Q    What was (the Victim’s) reaction when you climbed on top of her?

>> A    She told me to stop. So I got down from the bed. I did not touch her anywhere.[^556]

>> …

>> A    … I did not touch anywhere else.[^557]

> (e)      P20.

>> Q    Besides your big toe which you thought might have penetrated (the Victim’s) vagina on 24 Sept 2017, have you ever penetrated any finger into her vagina?

>> A    No[^558]

>> …

>> Q    Have you ever penetrated your penis into (the Victim’s) vagina?

>> A    No. It was only outside her vagina.[^559]

>> …

>> Q    Tell me if you have ever done similar acts to (the Victim’s sister).

>> A    No. (The Victim’s sister) no.[^560]

>> …

>> A    … But she did not suck for me.[^561]

>> …

>> Q    Have you ever showed pornography to (the Victim)?d

>> A    No never.[^562]

## Psychiatric report of the Accused

193    Dr Hatta Santoso Ong (Dr Ong)[^563] prepared a psychiatric report on the Accused dated 16 October 2017.[^564] When Dr Ong testified in court, he was an Associate Consultant Psychiatrist at Changi General Hospital with the Department of Psychological Medicine.[^565] Dr Ong is a Clinical Instructor at the Duke-NUS Medical School, Clinical Lecturer at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, and a Physician Faculty Member at the Family Medicine Residency Programme.[^566]

194    Dr Ong had examined the Accused at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on 4 occasions: 5 October 2017 (twice), 10 October 2017 and 12 October 2017.[^567] During these interviews, Dr Ong stated that the Accused was alert, calm, collected and coherent.[^568] The Accused’s answers were relevant, linear, logical and not disrupted in any way.[^569] His mood was not depressed.[^570] The Accused’s affect was reactive and he showed the appropriate emotions, for example, he cried during the third interview when “narrating how guilty he felt about what he had done to the Victim”.[^571]

195    Significantly, the Accused did not complain to Dr Ong about anything, including his encounters with the police officers.[^572] And the Accused also did not complain about anything to the nurses.[^573]

196    Despite the fact that this was the first time that he had testified in court, Dr Ong was a steady and careful witness. [^574] Dr Ong was also candid and readily admitted that he could not remember certain points.[^575]

### Whether the Accused understood English

197    The psychiatric report contained several admissions by the Accused in relation to sexually abusing the Victim. The Defence contended that the contents of the psychiatric report were unreliable because the interviews had been conducted in English.

198    With respect, I disagreed with the Defence. I will elaborate.

199    I was aware that the Accused was educated until secondary two[^576] without a formal education in the English language,[^577] and he had a Malay interpreter during the recording of most of his police statements and during the trial. Dr Ong did not read back to the Accused what he had typed during the interviews.[^578]

200    However, the Accused scored very well for his test in the English language.[^579] Dr Ong stated that the Accused had a fluent command of the English language.[^580] Given the fact that the Accused spoke English, he could reply relevantly to all the questions, and he did not request for an interpreter, thus, there was no interpreter present during the interviews or the mini-mental state examination.[^581] During the interviews, there was once when the Accused used a Malay word, and he was able to explain to Dr Ong that it meant ‘penetration’.[^582] I did not accept the Accused’s claim that he spoke to Dr Ong in Malay.

201    The Defence intimated that Dr Ong had used phrases such as ‘skin-to-skin contact’[^583] from the summary of facts received from the police after the second interview. However, phrases such as “skin-to-skin contact” were _not_ found in the summary of facts.[^584] Moreover, during the first interview, the Accused had already described to Dr Ong about the “incident in 2017, for which he was arrested for at that time”.[^585] In any case, during the main trial, the Accused admitted that the phrase “skin to skin”[^586] came from himself.[^587]

202    During the interviews, Dr Ong had asked him open-ended questions,[^588] with the phrases in quotation marks such as ‘skin-to-skin contact’ all coming from the Accused.[^589] These phrases in quotation marks had been recorded verbatim by Dr Ong in his interview notes.[^590] Apart from challenging Dr Ong for the phrase “skin-to-skin contact” during cross-examination, Dr Ong’s evidence that all the other phrases in quotation marks emanated from the Accused went unchallenged. Contrary to the Accused’s allegations, I did not find it believable that Dr Ong would make up the contents of the psychiatric report at paragraphs 14 to 28, especially when certain parts were exculpatory.[^591]

203    For completeness, based on the totality of the evidence and having observed him in court, it was implausible that the Accused did not really understand English. The following reasons bear emphasis:

> (a)      Medical Doctors. Doctors testified that they spoke to the Accused in English without an interpreter.

>> (i)        Dr Hatta Santoso Ong. Dr Ong stated that the Accused had a fluent command of the English language.[^592] The Accused replied relevantly to all the questions in English. The Accused agreed that he had used certain English phrases/ words when speaking to Dr Ong, including “very lovely”,[^593] “unable to function”,[^594] “penis cannot stand”,[^595] “steaming”,[^596] “maybe I could not control myself”,[^597] “skin to skin”,[^598] “leaked out by itself”,[^599] “touch the outside, but not insert deep inside”,[^600] “it feel like she giving me permission”,[^601] “finished”,[^602] and “it is no good for old man to do this” [^603].[^604]

>> (ii)        Dr Lin Hanjie. The Accused spoke to Dr Lin entirely in English without an interpreter.[^605] Dr Lin and the Accused were able to have a meaningful conversation in English,[^606] and some of Dr Lin’s questions were open-ended.[^607] The Accused had described his medical conditions to Dr Lin in English.[^608]

>> (iii)        Dr Yak Si Mian. Dr Yak had posed open-ended questions to the Accused, who spoke in English without an interpreter.[^609] The Accused did not request for an interpreter and appeared to understand the entire conversation.[^610] It was possible that the Accused used some Malay words but not more than 1 or 2 Malay words as Dr Yak does not understand Malay.[^611]

> (b)      Interpreters. Mr Mohammad Rashikin stated that the Accused understands English because at times he spoke in English even before the question had been interpreted.[^612] During the recording of both P14 and P20, the Accused was able to answer the questions in English. Mdm Maria Bazid testified that the Accused had spoken in both English and Malay when P18 was recorded.[^613]

> (c)      Officers. Insp Mohamad Noor stated that the Accused spoke English fluently and was able to read in English.[^614] Supt Burhanudeen also said that the Accused was fluent in English,[^615] ASP Alvin Chua testified that the Accused chose to speak in English during the recording of his long statements.[^616] The Accused even corrected ASP Alvin Chua’s grammer in P18, as evidenced from editing the phrase “that happened” to “which happened”.[^617] Some of the Accused’s phrases were reproduced verbatim in P18, such as “romanced”,[^618] “shoot”, [^619] and “play”;[^620] the Accused admitted that he had used these English words.[^621]

> (d)      In Court. On several occasions during the trial, the Accused corrected the court interpreter’s English, for example, he substituted her use of the word “bench” with “chair”.[^622] He also answered questions posed in English without waiting for the translation (_Public Prosecutor v BQD_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 183</span> at \[27\]).[^623] On another occasion, he answered a question under cross-examination before it had been interpreted.[^624] During re-examination, the Defence Counsel reminded the Accused to speak Malay instead of English. And during the trial, I observed that he read on his own several documents that were tendered as court exhibits.

204    Finally, Dr Ong was not cross-examined on various points that only surfaced during the Accused’s re-examination for the first ancillary hearing, such as (a) during the interviews with Dr Ong, the Accused had communicated in Malay with a Malay officer who was not an interpreter[^625] and (b) for the mini-mental state examination, the Accused was only “told to do a calculation in Math. There is no language needed, just to write it down and draw. That’s all”:[^626] rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 as analysed in the Court of Appeal cases of _Harven a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 771</span> at \[66\] and _Asnah Bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 944</span> at \[115\] (see also Jeffrey Pinsler, _Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 2013), at \[20.96\]). During the main trial, the Accused admitted that he had been alone with Dr Ong for the interviews, _viz_ no one else was present.

205    During the ancillary hearing, the Accused also claimed that Dr Ong spoke to him in the “Indonesian” language, although the Accused then said that he cannot remember.[^627] A similar thing happened during the main trial – the Accused claimed that Dr Ong spoke to him in Malay, although the Accused then said that he could not remember the language used.

206    For the Accused’s psychiatric report, Dr Ong was also not cross-examined on various points that only surfaced during the Accused’s examination-in-chief during the main trial, such as:

> (a)      Paragraph 17. The Accused denied telling Dr Ong that “(h)e said that he would masturbate to pornographic videos 1 to 2 times a month”.[^628]

> (b)      Paragraph 20. The Accused said that this did not happen, and he did not tell Dr Ong that “I could not control myself” and that he had hugged the Victim with “skin to skin” contact.[^629] He denied telling Dr Ong about the contents in paragraph 20.[^630]

> (c)      Paragraph 21. The Accused said that this did not happen.[^631] He did not use the following phrases: “steam”, “that time I play with (the Victim), my penis stand. Her vagina looked like adult, plus she was naked, and showed her buttocks”, and the semen “leaked out by itself”.[^632] He denied telling Dr Ong about the contents in paragraph 21.[^633]

> (d)      Paragraph 22. The Accused said that this did not happen;[^634] he did not admit to the contents in paragraph 22.[^635] He denied telling Dr Ong about the contents in paragraph 22.[^636]

> (e)      Paragraph 23. The Accused said that this did not happen.[^637] He denied using his finger to “touch the outside (of the Victim’s vagina), but not insert deep inside”.[^638] He denied telling Dr Ong about the contents in paragraph 23.[^639]

> (f)      Paragraph 24. The Accused said that this did not happen.[^640] He initially could not remember whether he had told Dr Ong that “it feel like she giving me permission”,[^641] before testifying that he did not say that to Dr Ong.[^642]

> (g)      Paragraph 25. The Accused said that this did not happen.[^643] He did not use the following phrases: “finished” and “it is no good for old man to do this”.[^644] He denied telling Dr Ong about the contents in paragraph 25.[^645]

> (h)      Paragraph 26. The Accused said that this did not happen.[^646] The Accused denied telling Dr Ong about the contents in paragraph 26.[^647]

> (j)     The Accused claimed that he did not understand what Dr Ong was asking him. The Accused said that he had spoken to Dr Ong in a mixture of Malay and English, using Malay and a little bit of English.[^650]

### Mental state of the Accused

207    Dr Ong testified that the Accused’s cognition was not impaired.[^651] The Accused scored a total of 28 out of 30 points for his mini-mental state examination administered on 10 October 2017, which indicated no significant impairment in cognition.[^652] Dr Ong stated that the Accused lost one point each for sustained attention and language, but that he had scored 4 points and 7 points for these categories respectively and overall, his score of 28/30 demonstrates that his cognition was not impaired.[^653]

208    Dr Ong testified that the Accused tested negative for the dementing process or any impairment of his cognitive processes.[^654] A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain done on 13 October 2017 did not show significant changes that were out of proportion to his age.[^655] Dr Ong testified that the Accused would be able to exercise full judgement in 2015 and 2017.[^656] In the psychiatric report, Dr Ong was of the opinion that the Accused had no mental illness,[^657] he was not of unsound mind at and around the material time of the alleged offence,[^658] and he was aware of the nature of his actions.[^659]

## Rebuttal witness

209    The statutory basis for the admission of rebuttal evidence is s 230(1)(t) of the CPC.[^660] Section 230(1)(t) gives the Prosecution the right to call a person as a witness or recall a witness for the purpose of rebuttal, and is intended to allow the calling of rebuttal evidence based on the long-standing practice in the courts (Jennifer Marie & Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir, _The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2012) at \[12.060\] and \[12.061\]): _Public Prosecutor v BNO_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 243</span> at \[60\] and _Public Prosecutor v Teo Ghim Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 13</span> at \[53\].

210    The admission of rebuttal evidence is a matter for the court’s discretion, and the threshold for allowing rebuttal evidence for both civil and criminal proceedings was set out in _Public Prosecutor v Bridges Christopher_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 467</span> at \[51\]:

> 51    … \[The calling of rebuttal evidence\] will be allowed only in the case of a matter arising _ex improviso_, _ie_ one which the plaintiff could not reasonably have foreseen. In other words where the plaintiff has been misled or taken by surprise or in answer to evidence of the defendant in support of an issue the proof of which lay upon the defendant.

211    While the Court of Appeal in _Bridges Christopher_ stated in the reproduced extract (in the first sentence) that rebuttal evidence was permissible if the issue was not reasonably foreseeable, the subsequent sentence makes it clear that rebuttal evidence was permissible in two alternative situations. First, where the accused person was misled or taken by surprise, _ie_, the issue was not reasonably foreseeable. The second was where the burden of proof was on the accused. The two situations are mutually exclusive: _Teo Ghim Heng_ at \[56\].

212    This interpretation of _Bridges Christopher_ is consistent with the decision in _BNO_. In _BNO_ (at \[61\]), the court considered whether the rebuttal evidence the Prosecution sought to adduce was _either_ to address an issue that the Prosecution could not reasonably have foreseen, _or_ to address “an issue in respect of which the burden of proof lay upon the Accused”. The court eventually ruled against the Prosecution on both counts, but the analysis in _BNO_ reveals that the court’s approach was to consider both questions (reasonable foreseeability and burden of proof) as _alternative_, and _not_ cumulative requirements: _Teo Ghim Heng_ at \[57\].

213    In the present case, the Prosecution applied to recall ASP Alvin Chua as a rebuttal witness at the end of the defence’s case.[^661] This was because contrary to the Victim’s mother’s testimony,[^662] it was IO Fanin and Mohammed Ridzuan,[^663] not ASP Alvin Chua, who had handed NP 306A[^664] to the Victim’s mother.[^665]

214    However, this issue was not one where the burden of proof lay upon the accused person. Moreover, the Prosecution rightly conceded that while this issue may not be reasonably foreseeable, it did _not_ engage its legal burden.[^666] In other words, the issue of who had handed NP 306A to the Victim’s mother was _not material_ for the charges in the trial.[^667] In this connection, the legal burden of proof[^668] is always on the Prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, each and every element of the charges against the accused person, and s 230(1)(t) of the CPC applies in the context of a main trial to determine an accused person’s guilt. In the circumstances, I did not accede to the Prosecution’s application to recall ASP Alvin Chua as a rebuttal witness.

## Disclosure obligations

215    In the Defence’s closing submissions, as part of the _Kadar_ and _Nabill_ disclosure obligations, it argued that the Victim’s male cousin’s statement recorded on 26 September 2017 should have been disclosed to the Defence.[^669]

216    I did not agree for the reasons set out below.

### Kadar

217    In _Kadar_, the Court of Appeal held (at \[113\]) that the Prosecution must disclose to the Defence material which takes the form of:

> (a)    any unused material that is likely to be admissible and might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused; and

> (b)    any unused material that is likely to be inadmissible but would provide a real (not fanciful) chance of pursing a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused.

218    It is possible to analyse the triggering of the disclosure obligation by reference to four main elements: the material must be (a) unused; (b) either “likely to be admissible” or “provide a \[real\] chance of pursuing a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be admissible”; (c) seemingly credible; and (d) seemingly relevant to the guilt or innocence of an accused person: _Xu Yuanchen v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 64</span> at \[23\].

219    It should also be noted that in _Kadar_, the Court of Appeal had clarified that these disclosure obligations do not cover materials that are neutral or adverse to an accused person: _Xu Yuanchen_ at \[24\].

220    By the time the trial begins, the Prosecution is presumed to have evaluated the evidence, released any disclosable material and ultimately complied with its _Kadar_ disclosure obligations: _Lee Siew Boon Winston v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1184</span> (“_Winston Lee_”) at \[184\]. The Defence is free to challenge this presumption and where a dispute over the disclosability of the evidence arises, the court will be the final arbiter as to whether disclosure ought to have been made: _Winston Lee_ at \[162\] and _Xu Yuanchen_ at \[24\].

221    In the present case, applying the principles set out in _Winston Lee_, I was of the view that the _Kadar_ disclosure obligations had not been triggered since there was no indication that the cousin’s statement would assist the Defence or weaken the Prosecution’s case. It should be emphasised that this rested on a considered assessment and assertion by the Prosecution that it had reviewed the material and come to the conclusion that the material in question did not come within the ambit of its _Kadar_ disclosure obligations. There was no material before me to cast doubt on the Prosecution’s assessment and its consequent assertion that the statement was not disclosable at this stage, and there was therefore no basis for displacing the working presumption that the Prosecution was in compliance with its obligations (see _Winston Lee_ at \[175\] and \[184(b)\], endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Lee Siew Boon Winston v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 67</span> at \[10\]-\[13\]; see also _Xu Yuanchen_ at \[35\]).

### Nabill

222    In _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 984</span> (“_Nabill_”), the Court of Appeal held that the Prosecution was required to disclose to the Defence, statements furnished to the police by a material witness. In _Nabill_, this duty was referred to as the Prosecution’s “additional disclosure obligations”. A “material witness” was defined in this context as a person “who can be expected to confirm, or conversely, contradict an accused person’s defence in material respects”: _Nabill_ at \[4\].

223    The Court of Appeal, in _Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 103</span> at \[133\] stated that based on _Nabill_, the Prosecution’s additional disclosure obligations do not presently extend to the statements of a “material witness” who is also a prosecution witness.

224    As to whether the statements of such a witness ought to be disclosed, the Court of Appeal expressly left this issue open in _Nabill_ (at \[50\]) and _Roshdi_ (at \[133\]) because it did not arise on the facts. The Court of Appeal in _Roshdi_ reiterated the provisional views expressed in _Nabill_ (at \[54\]-\[56\]) that if a prosecution witness has given a statement which is inconsistent with his testimony at trial, the Prosecution would generally be required to disclose such a statement to the Defence as part of its _Kadar_ obligations.

225    In the present case, the Victim’s male cousin is a material witness. However, I was of the view that the _Nabill_ disclosure obligations had not been triggered as he had already given evidence in court as a prosecution witness. In the circumstances, a key rationale for imposing the additional disclosure obligations on the Prosecution in _Nabill_ was not engaged.

226    This key rationale in _Nabill_ was that the accused person ought to have access to all relevant information in order to make an informed choice in deciding whether or not to call a “material witness” (_Nabill_ at \[45\]-\[47\]). The Defence would be at a distinct disadvantage if it is not aware of what the witness has previously said in the course of police investigations, and this would not reflect a satisfactory balance between ensuring fairness to the accused person and preserving the adversarial nature of the trial process. This rationale in _Nabill_ was not engaged on our facts.

227    Furthermore, there are cogent public policy reasons for reasonably limiting the disclosure of witness statements. In particular, the broad disclosure of witness statements may disincentivise witnesses from coming forward to assist in investigations and expose them to the risk of being harassed by an accused person. In other words, there is a broad public interest in ensuring that witnesses are not unduly disincentivised from providing information to law enforcement agencies in a free and candid manner (_Roshdi_ at \[136\] and \[142\]).

228    For completeness, as mentioned above, the Prosecution had already assessed and asserted that it had reviewed the cousin’s statement and come to the conclusion that it did not come within the ambit of its _Kadar_ disclosure obligations.

## Verdict

229    Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on all the charges. For the avoidance of doubt, I would have arrived at the same conclusion regardless of whether the Accused’s wife’s credit had been impeached.

230    I will proceed to hear submissions on sentence.
