28 November 2019

### District Judge John Ng:

These are two appeals against sentence filed by the same Defence Counsel for the two offenders, Mohamad Khair Bin Jonid (“Khair”) and Noor Hazlan Bin Selamat (“Hazlan”), now serving sentence in Prisons. Each offender was sentenced to an **imprisonment term of 42 months and a fine of $34,000,000**, backdated to take effect from 13 December 2018. The sentences were passed after each of them had pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> “You, are charged that you, sometime between February and March 2018, in Singapore, did engage in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely to deal with uncustomed goods, and in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, _to wit_, on the 23rd day of March 2018, at about 2.20pm, at #08-38 of Eco-Tech@Sunview, 1 Sunview Road, Singapore, you were concerned in dealing with 6,550 cartons x 200 sticks and 4,250 cartons x 160 sticks of assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes, weighing 2,126.164 kg, on which excise duty of $1,123,010 was not paid, with intent to defraud the Government of the excise duty thereon, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 128I(1)(b) read with Section 140 of the Customs Act (Cap. 70)”

2       A connected charge in relation to the Goods and Services Tax Act for the same uncustomed goods of duty unpaid cigarettes was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing each of them. Both of them were repeat offenders and were subjected to the enhanced punishment under Section 128L(5A) of the same Act.

## Brief facts of this case

3       Investigations revealed that sometime between February and March 2018, one Rahmad Bin Mohd Yasin (“Rahmad”) had approached Hazlan to find a warehouse to store duty upaid cigarettes. The warehouse was to have a sufficiently large space outside of the unit to park a 20-foot container. Hazlan in turn approached Khair who agreed to rent the unit as he was also in the process of sourcing for a unit to store his mechanic tools. Rahmad had promised Hazlan $5,000 to be shared between Khair and Hazlan for every successful shipment of duty unpaid cigarettes delivered to the unit. They found a unit for rent at Eco-Tech@Sunview. Khair signed a tenancy agreement of two years to rent the unit #08-38 from 7 March 2018 to 6 March 2020.

4       On 10 March 2018, Hazlan conducted a “test run” using mattresses. Hazlan told Khair the “test run” was to ensure their method works. Pursuant to their conspiracy, Khair had rented the unit for the storage of duty unpaid cigarettes while Hazlan had acted as the intermediary between Rahmad and Khair. In the middle of March 2018, pursuant to their conspiracy to store duty unpaid cigarettes in the unit, Rahmad approached one Kamaruddin Bin Abdul Latiff who agreed to buy duty unpaid cigarettes and placed an order with Rahmad for 50 boxes of duty unpaid cigarettes. These 50 boxes were part of the 6,550 cartons x 200 sticks and 4,250 cartons x 160 sticks of duty unpaid cigarettes, weighing 2,126.164 kg seized from a container parked at #08-38 Eco-Tech@Sunview at about 12.45pm on 23 March 2018.

5       Khair admitted to his involvement in renting the unit to store duty unpaid cigarettes. Khair admitted that Hazlan was the person who had offered him an equal share of the $5,000 per shipment. Khair, Hazlan and Rahmad had met up sometime between February and March 2018 to source for the warehouse.

## Criminal Records

#### Previous Convictions of Mohamad Khair Bin Jonid

6       Khair is 51 years old (DOB: 12 July 1968) and he was convicted on 20 September 2017 and sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment for the importation of 24.68 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes. There was also a conviction for a related GST charge and he was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment to run concurrently.

#### Antecedents of Noor Hazlan

7       Hazlan is almost 52 years old (DOB: 14 December 1967) and has a previous conviction on 2 December 2016 for dealing with 73 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes for which he was sentenced to imprisonment of 7 months. There was also a conviction for the related GST charge for which he was sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment to run concurrently.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

8       The Customs Prosecutor submitted a sentence of 42 months each for the two offenders and a fine of $33,690,300 in default 28 months’ imprisonment. The sentencing factors were:

> ·    A large quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes

> ·    A part of a syndicate

> ·    Not simple paid workers at the bottom of the smuggling operation

> ·    Repeat offenders

9       The Customs Prosecutor submitted the case precedents of _PP v Chung Siew Meng_ (DAC 45039/2013 & Ors, unreported case), _PP v Ng Ghim Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 42</span> and _PP v Mok Chee Kin_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 118</span>, in support of their submissions on sentence. These cases involved repeat offenders and huge amounts of duty unpaid cigarettes similar to the two offenders in the present case. There were variations in their sentences depending on their culpability and involvement.

## Mitigation

10     The Defence Counsel submitted that the Offenders had pleaded guilty and was remorseful for committing the offences. The Defence Counsel urged the Court to give significant weight to the fact that both of them did not stand to gain much as they were to receive only $2,500 each per shipment. He also submitted that although both of them are repeat offenders, the sentence ought not to be much higher than the sentences they had received previously. Without qualifying the plea, the Defence Counsel intimated that the Court should bear in mind that there is nothing to suggest that the two offenders were privy to the actual quantity of the cigarettes to be stored.

## Reasons for the Sentence

11     At the outset, two sentencing factors stood out in this case. The first is the huge quantity of uncustomed cigarettes specified in the charges against both Offenders. The second is that both of them were repeat offenders and subjected to the enhanced punishments for the offences.

#### Punishment under Section 128L(5A)

12     The offence where the tobacco exceeds 2 kilogrammes for a repeat offender under Section 128L(5A) Customs Act is a fine of not less than 30 times and not more than 40 times the amount of the excise duty which would have been evaded AND imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 years. The minimum fines in this case for each of them amounted to a staggering **$33,690,300** for the assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes weighing _more than_ **2,000 kilogrammes**, on which excise duty of more than $1 million was not paid.

13     The dominant sentencing principle is Deterrence – both General and Specific Deterrence. The primary sentencing objective for offences relating to the evasion of excise duty is deterrence. In this case, both general and specific deterrence would apply, given the prior convictions for similar offences of both Offenders.

14     The High Court had provided guidance for sentencing cases involving uncustomed cigarettes in the cases of _PP v Pang Shuo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 82</span>, which followed from the previous decision in _Yap Ah Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 70</span>, in relation to the general sentencing considerations for Customs offences involving cigarette smuggling. The High Court in _Pang Shuo_ held at \[36\] to \[44\] that the “major factors” that would influence the sentence would include the following:

> (a)     The quantity of tobacco product involved;

> (b)     The repetition of the offence;

> (c)     Whether the offender acted on his own or was involved in a syndicated operation;

> (d)     Extent of the offender’s role;

> (e)     Impact of a guilty plea.

15     In particular, in _Yap Ah Lai_, it was held that the quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes involved would be the “primary factor” or “key parameter” in sentencing. In addition, the High Court in _Pang Shuo_ emphasised that it was necessary to distinguish between the offending act and the actual extent of an offender’s role, with the latter being a “separate and an exceptionally serious aggravating factor in sentencing”.

16     The roles of both Offenders were not that of minions. They played very active roles in the commission of the offences. I am in agreement with the submissions of the Prosecution that their culpabilities in the present case were high. They were not mere workers carrying out loading and unloading, unaware of the details of the operation. They were active participants in the conspiracy, from being involved in the discussion on renting the premises to the carrying out of the plans for the storage of the contraband cigarettes. A trial run was even orchestrated using mattresses and conducted to test out the viability of the intended illegal operations.

17     It was ingenuous and incorrect for the Defence Counsel to suggest that both his clients should not be responsible for the huge amounts of the cigarettes seized. It is clear in the admitted Statement of Facts that they were looking specifically at a unit that would allow for the parking of a 20-foot container at the rented premises.

18     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that a sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment for each offender was warranted in the circumstances of this case. This was commensurate with the Offenders’ high culpability and the extremely large quantity of uncustomed cigarettes involved.

19     The length of the imprisonment term was also in line with the relevant sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution in support of their calibration. The precedents cited involved repeat offenders and quantities of uncustomed cigarettes in the same region as that for the present case.

20     Moving on to the in-default imprisonment terms. The punishment under Section 128L(5A) of the Act is stipulated with high mandatory fines. The amount of excise duty that would have been evaded was a massive **$1,123,010**. The range of the fines to be imposed was from **$33,690,300 to $44,920,400**. A fine of **$34 million** was imposed, in default 28 months’ imprisonment.

21     In arriving at the default sentence that I have imposed, I can do no better than to adopt the cogent reasoning of the District Judge Ong Chin Rhu in _PP v Ng Ghim Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 42</span> at paragraphs 50 to 54 of her judgment. After reviewing the methodologies proposed by the Prosecution and the Defence in that case, the judge found the approach recommended by the Prosecution to be principled and consistent with precedents. She adopted the approach and ordered a default sentence of imprisonment of **28 months for a fine of $34 million**.

22     In our case, the fine imposed for each of the two Offenders is similarly $34 million. There is no reason not to impose the same default sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment. The maximum in-default sentence for non-payment of the fine was 6 years or 72 months.

#### Sentences of accomplices

23     To ensure that the sentencing principle of parity is observed, the sentences of the accomplices were also taken into account. Rahmad, the person who had promised them $5,000 per shipment, was sentenced to imprisonment of 45 months and the same fine amount (and default sentence). He was represented by a different counsel. He was also a repeat offender. He was given a higher custodial sentence than both offenders in view of the fact that he was the one who had initiated the offence and had the additional role of sourcing for buyers.

24     Kamaruddin Bin Abdul Latiff was the intended buyer of just under 500 kilogrammes of duty unpaid cigarettes from the more than 2000 kilogrammes found inside the container. He was also a repeat offender. He was sentenced to 33 months of imprisonment and a fine of $8,000,000 in default 21 months’ imprisonment. His sentence was much lower, due to the fact that he was only liable for a smaller part (about a quarter) of the consignment of duty unpaid cigarettes.
