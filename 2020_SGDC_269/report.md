Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Consecutive sentences

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9875/2020/01.\]

23 November 2020

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused pleaded guilty to three charges for offences under the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (“MDR”) and the Prisons Act (“PA”). He was sentenced in total to eight months’ and 270 days’ imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 300 days’ imprisonment. In addition, he was also fined $1,000 in default to serve an additional three days’ imprisonment. The fine was not paid.

2       He is appealing against the sentence and is serving the imprisonment sentence.

## Charges

3       There were a total of five charges against the accused. The prosecution proceeded with three charges. He pleaded guilty to the three proceeded charges and consented to the remaining two other charges to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of deciding his overall sentence. I set out the five charges in greater detail as follows:

5       I ordered the imprisonment sentences for the 1st and 3rd charge to run consecutively thus adding up to a total imprisonment term of **eight (8) months' and 270 days' imprisonment plus an enhanced sentence of 300 days' imprisonment**. The imprisonment sentence was backdated to 9 January 2020 when he was remanded for these offences. He was also fined $1,000 in default to serve three (3) days' imprisonment.

## Statement of Facts

6       The accused unconditionally admitted to the following statement of facts (“SOF”). He was represented by counsel who confirmed the same. The SOF is set out as follows:

> 1.    The accused is Mohamad Hazer Bin Mohamad Hassim, NRIC No. XXX, a 32-year-old male Singapore citizen born on 13 November 1987.

> 2.    The complainant is one Joseph Lee Eng Hao, a Senior Operations Manager at Selarang Halfway House (“SHWH”) located at 1825 Upper Changi Road North, Singapore 506780. The complainant manages supervisees who are residing at SHWH while being emplaced on the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”).

> EMPLACEMENT UNDER THE MAS AND THE RELEVANT CONDITIONS

> 3.    On 9 December 2019, the Commissioner of Prisons issued an order under section 50I of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (“Prisons Act”), suspending the remaining portion of the accused’s sentence from 9 December 2019 to 26 October 2021 (both dates inclusive) (“Remission Order”).

> 4.    In accordance with sections 50U and 50V of the Prisons Act, the accused was placed on MAS and subject to mandatory aftercare conditions under Section 50V(3) of the Prisons Act, for the period from 9 December 2019 to 8 June 2021 (both dates inclusive).

> 5.    The mandatory aftercare conditions stated in the Remission Order included, _inter alia_, the following:

>> A.1    \[The accused\] must, unless admitted to hospital, reside in a halfway house at 1825 Upper Changi Road North Singapore (506780) for the period as required by the Commissioner of Prisons.

>> B.1    \[The accused\] must remain indoors between 2200 hours and 0600 hours every day of the week at the halfway house or specified place or your place of residence the day of the week and timing of which may be adjusted from time to time by your supervision officer(s) or by the Manager of the halfway house as the case may be.

> 6.    The Remission Order also specified that a failure to remain indoors, when required to do so under the Remission Order or at the time and day specified by supervision officer(s) or Manager of the halfway house, for a cumulative period of 24 hours would constitute a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition.

> 7.    The accused had signed on the Remission Order on 9 December 2019, acknowledging that the contents of the said Remission Order had been fully explained to him and fully understood by him.

> FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1ST CHARGE (MAC-900192-2020) – FAILING TO REMAIN INDOORS AT HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE FOR A CUMULATIVE PERIOD OF MORE THAN 24 HOURS

> 8.    On 28 December 2019, at 11.59pm, the accused failed to return to SHWH after his time-off had expired.

> 9.    On 29 December 2019, at or about 12.32am, the Duty staff working at SHWH called the accused’s mobile phone to inform him that his time-off had expired. The accused did not answer the calls. Text messages were sent to the accused via SMS and WhatsApp asking him to update his location and to return to SHWH immediately.

> 10.    Later the same day, at or about 3.37am, the accused sent a WhatsApp message stating “I will return tomorrow”. Subsequently, at or about 7.31am, the accused sent another WhatsApp message stating that he would return to SHWH by 11pm the same day.

> 11.    On 29 December 2019, at or about 5.17pm, a time-off rescindment message was sent to the accused informing him that he would not have any approved time-off from 11.59pm on 29 December 2019.

> 12.    On 30 December 2019, at or about 10.34am, the accused informed Programme Executive Pei Yin that he was no longer in Singapore and sent her a video of himself in Amsterdam, which he described as a “drug paradise”. When asked about how he managed to get through customs the accused reply was “I do some magic”. The accused also informed her that he intended to run away and had no intention of returning to Singapore.

> 13.    On 30 December 2019, at or about 7.25pm, the complainant lodged a Police report _vide_ G/20191230/7074 stating that the accused had committed a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition by failing to remain indoors at SHWH for a cumulative period of more than 24 hours.

> 14.    Subsequently, on 7 January 2020, at or about 10.15pm, the accused was arrested at Changi Airport Terminal 1.

> 15.    In total, the accused remained outside SHWH for a total of 219 hours and 45 minutes between 29 December 2019 and 7 January 2020. The breakdown is as follows:

> 16.    Investigations revealed that the accused had travelled to Amsterdam on 28 December 2019 without permission from SHWH. The accused claims that he travelled to Amsterdam to visit his cousin, one Maria Ally Nazmann, who was allegedly suffering from stage 4 breast cancer and who is herself wanted by the Central Narcotics Bureau. The accused has hitherto provided no believable evidence substantiating his claim.

> 17.    The accused admitted that he knew that he was required to remain indoors at SHWH when he was not on time-off and that it was wrong of him to fly to Amsterdam without a valid reason.

> 18.    The accused had therefore failed to remain indoors at SHWH for a cumulative period of more than 24 hours. Pursuant to Regulation 151H(1)(a) of the Prisons Regulations (Cap 247, Rg 2, 2002 Rev Ed), this constitutes a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition.

> 19.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence punishable under section 50Y(1)(a) of the Prisons Act and is thereby liable to be punished with a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of his Remission Order of 667 days from 30 December 2019 to 26 October 2021.

> FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 2ND CHARGE (DAC-900458-2020) – LEAVING SINGAPORE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE SUPERVISION OFFICER

> 20.    On 9 December 2019, the accused was placed under compulsory supervision for a period of 24 months, with effect from 9 December 2019, by virtue of a Supervision Order issued under Regulation 15 of the then Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“MDR”).

> 21.    Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(d) of the MDR, the accused was not permitted to leave Singapore without the permission of the supervision officer during the period that the Supervision Order was in effect.

> 22.    Investigations revealed that the accused left Singapore for Amsterdam on 28 December 2019 and returned to Singapore on 7 January 2020. The accused admitted that he was aware that he was not allowed to travel out of Singapore without obtaining the prior permission from the supervision officer but decided to go ahead anyway as he had a valid passport at the material time.

> 23.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(d) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) punishable under Regulation 15(6)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed).

> FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3RD CHARGE (DAC-900459-2020) – FAILING TO PRESENT HIMSELF FOR A URINE TEST

> 24.    Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(f) of the MDR, the accused was required to present himself for urine test at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters every Monday and Thursday of each month, between 9.30am and 10.00pm, during the period of supervision stated at paragraph 20 above and commencing on 12 December 2019.

> 25.    The accused subsequently failed to present himself for a urine test on 30 December 2019 (Monday) at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters. The accused had no medical certificate or valid reason justifying his failure to present himself for the urine test.

> 26.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed).

> 27.    Further, from 9 December 2019 to 26 October 2021, the accused was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act, which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act. Whilst the said remission order was in effect, the accused had on 30 December 2019 committed the aforementioned offence.

> 28.    Accordingly, upon his conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, the accused shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order, and is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 667 days from 30 December 2019 to 26 October 2021.

> 29.    Investigations further revealed that during the period of supervision, the accused had failed to present himself for urine tests on a total of 3 occasions.

> 30.    The accused admits to the abovementioned offences and stands charged accordingly.

## Relevant Antecedents

7       The accused was previously convicted between 2005 and 2010 of a number of offences including property-related offences for robbery, house-breaking, criminal breach of trust and theft.

8       More relevant to the present set of charges, both in terms of the nature of offence and also because of the consequential orders which flowed therefrom, were his successive convictions between 2010 and 2016 for consumption of drugs, enhanced consumption of drugs, long-term consumptions of drugs, possession of drugs and failing to report for urine tests (“FRUT”).

9       His last set of convictions were in 2016 for which he was sentenced to an aggregate of five years and eight months’ imprisonment with caning. He was then released from prison and was subject to a remission order between 9 December 2019 to 26 October 202. In addition, he was place under a separate drug supervision order for a duration of 24 months also with effect from 9 December 2019.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

10     The prosecution pressed for a global sentence of at least eight months’ and 295 days’ imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of at least 330 days’ imprisonment, in addition to a fine of $1,000. The prosecution further asked that all the imprisonment sentences be ordered to run consecutively. In response to my query, the learned DPP clarified in court that there was no question of the proposed sentence of a fine being made to run consecutively. Therefore, the breakdown of the prosecution’s proposed sentences (as orally corrected by the DPP) was as follows:

### 1st Charge under s 50V(3)(c) punishable under s 50Y(1)(a) PA

11     The first charge was for an offence under s 50Y(3)(c) and punishable under s 50Y(1)(a) of the PA for failing to remain indoors for a cumulative period of more than 24 hours. In the interest of brevity, I shall refer to this offence and the relevant charge as one of “breach of curfew”.

12     The prosecution adopted a three-stage approach to derive at its proposed sentence for this offence.

13     In the first stage, the prosecution considered the offence-specific factors as listed in s 50Y(2)(a) - (c) of the PA. These included the moderate gravity of the breach as gauged by the duration of the breach of almost 220 hours, and the fact that the accused initially informed the Programme Executive that he intended to run away and had no intention of returning to Singapore but subsequently informed that he was visiting his critically ill cousin. The prosecution also took into account that the accused committed the serious breach just three weeks into his remission and classified this factor to be of a higher severity. Finally, the prosecution considered as moderate the factor regarding whether the serious breach evidenced a lack of commitment by the accused to his rehabilitation and reintegration into society.

14     In the second stage of the evaluation, the prosecution pegged the offence to the ‘moderate to high’ sentencing band. This would be about 2/3 of the remaining duration of the remission order i.e. 445 days.

15     In the third and final stage of the evaluation, the prosecution considered the relevant offender specific factors and calibrated the sentence downwards by a third so as to reflect the accused’s plea of guilt and his voluntary return to Singapore thus arriving at a final sentence of 295 days.

### 2nd Charge under Reg 15(3)(d) punishable under Reg 15(6)(b) MDR

16     This was the charge for leaving the country without seeking the approval of the drug supervision officer. In line with a number of sentencing precedents, the prosecution asked for only a fine of $1000.

### 3rd Charge under Reg 15(3)(f) punishable under Reg 15(6)(a) MDR and s 50T(1)(a) PA

17     This is the charge for the FRUT offence with also carried a liability for an enhanced sentence. The prosecution sought a sentence of only eight months’ imprisonment for the primary offence even though the principle of escalation would have been relevant. Thus, the prosecution asked for the same sentence that was previously imposed on the accused in 2012 and 2016 for the same type of offence. This was to avoid any possibility of double counting but instead to consider the factor of repeat offending when computing the duration of the enhanced punishment.

18     The prosecution adopted what appeared to be a two-step process to derive the appropriate duration of enhanced punishment. The first step involved a consideration of the offence specific factors listed in s 50T(3) of the PA. These factors included the moderate severity of the present offence, the higher severity of the similarity of the last offences (for which he was released under the remission order) and the higher severity of the fact that he reoffended three weeks into his supervision period, and the TIC charges.

19     In the second step, the prosecution pegged the offence within a sentencing band above 2/3 of the remaining duration of the remission order (i.e. more than 445 days) given the overall high level of recalcitrance shown by the accused in step one. However, the prosecution calibrated the enhanced punishment downwards to give effect to the accused’s plea of guilt, thus deriving an enhanced sentence of 330 days.

20     As regards the global sentence, the prosecution submitted that the imprisonment sentences and the enhanced sentence in respect of the first charge for breach of curfew and the third charge for FRUT ought to run consecutively for reasons which I agreed and as set out below.

## Mitigation Plea

21     In his written mitigation plea, counsel provided the accused’s background for the court’s consideration. In short, the accused is single and is 32 years old. At the relevant time of the offences, he had been released from prison pursuant to a remission order issued by the Commissioner of Prisons.

22     Counsel further elaborated on the accused’s reason for leaving the country in his oral address to the court. After the accused was released from prison, his cousin who was then living in the Netherlands contacted him. She told him that she had advanced stage cancer and begged to see the accused before she passed on. Being very close to her, the accused could not disappoint her and agreed to her “final” request. She assisted the accused to apply online for a passport and also bought him a plane ticket. He flew off to Amsterdam on or about the 28 December 2019. Counsel also acknowledged that the accused sent a message to his programme executive (as stated in the SOF at \[12\]) to tell her that he was in Amsterdam.

23     After he had arrived in Amsterdam, he realised that his cousin had lied to him in that her condition was not as serious as she had made it out to be. She was in fact receiving treatment and was not on her death bed so to speak. Counsel impressed upon the court that even though illicit drugs were freely available in Amsterdam and despite the encouragement of his cousin, the accused did not succumb to temptation to take drugs. He also decided to return to Singapore and did so at the earliest opportunity on 7 January 2020 whereupon he was arrested. Just before he returned to Singapore, he contacted his reporting officer, his counsellor and his programme executive to tell them he was returning to Singapore.

24     Counsel submitted that the accused only left the country for a few days and only because he was duped by his cousin. Counsel took issue with the prosecution’s submission that the accused’s claim regarding his cousin’s medical condition was unsubstantiated. Counsel tendered a medical report in support of his mitigation.

25     Counsel further submitted that the offence of not remaining indoors and the offence of FRUT were committed for the same reason, namely that he was not in Singapore. Therefore, counsel urged the court to order the imprisonment terms in respect of these two charges to run concurrently, and to back-date his sentence to 9 January 2020 which was when he was remanded after his arrest.

## Sentencing Considerations

26     At the material time, the accused was subject to a remission order as well as a drug supervision order. Both orders took effect concurrently from 9 December 2019. He then committed five offences very shortly by committing acts in breach of the conditions and obligations arising out of the said orders. He pleaded guilty to three charges in relation to three of the offences.

27     The said three charges were for (i) an offence of breaching his curfew under s 50Y(1)(a) of the PA for failing to remain indoors for a cumulative period of more than 24 hours; (ii) an offence punishable under the MDR for leaving Singapore without the approval of the supervision officer whilst being subject to a drug supervision order; and (iii) another offence punishable under the MDR for FRUT whilst being subject to the said drug supervision order. As he had committed the FRUT offence and had therefore breached the basic condition of the remission order dated 9 December 2019, he was also liable for an enhanced sentence up to the length of the remaining duration of the said order.

### Sentencing principles

28     I agree with the learned DPP’s submission that the applicable and predominant sentencing principles were that of general and specific deterrence. I accept that this case called for an adequate sentence to properly reflect both aspects of the deterrence principle.

29     The principle of general deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public (see generally _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Men_g”)). It is in the public interest that a strong message be sent to inmates who are released early from their prison sentences pursuant to a remission order that they have to abide by the conditions of the order and remain accountable for their actions and behaviour outside prison. They must be reminded that the privileges and benefits of a very early release from prison also come hand in hand with responsibilities and accountability. This system of early release benefits all inmates and must not be abused and compromised by the irresponsible few such as the present accused.

30     At the same time, specific deterrence in sentencing was also applicable in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an accused to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition (_PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[25\] – \[29\]).

31     I considered the accused’s many previous and similar drugs-related convictions, including similar convictions for FRUT offences. It has been held that an accused’s criminal record is relevant to the extent that a sentencing judge may draw certain inferences about the accused's character, attitude and likelihood of rehabilitation (_Sim Yeow Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 466</span> at \[8\]). In this case, the accused reoffended by committing yet another FRUT offence, having committed the same offence in 2012 and 2016. This offence (together with the TIC charges for further FRUT offences) certainly formed a persistent, regular and continuing pattern of reoffending.

32     It was also unquestionable that the present set of offences was committed by the accused intentionally and wilfully. As highlighted above, the accused was released from prison after his 2016 convictions and was subject to a remission order between 9 December 2019 to 26 October 202. As stated at \[7\] of the SOF, the accused signed on the remission order on 9 December 2019 and acknowledged that the contents of the said remission order had been fully explained to him and that he fully understood the conditions of the remission order. One such condition was the “basic condition” that he is not to commit any offence during the period of remission. The accused was also placed under the mandatory aftercare scheme (“MAS”) pursuant to the remission order which, _inter alia_, required him to reside at a halfway house and to stick to a curfew i.e. to remain indoors between 10 pm and 6 am every day.

33     He was also subject to a drug supervision order for a duration of 24 months. He committed the present offences barely a month into his remission and supervision order periods. Not only was he aware that he had to report for his urine tests, he was also keenly aware that he was subject to a remission order which mandated that he shall not commit an offence during the remission period. Further, as highlighted above, he was also subject to the MAS curfew conditions.

34     Therefore, he knew full well that he was subject to both a supervision order and a remission order which carried conditions and obligations and yet he chose, not simply to ignore them, but to wilfully breach them by absconding and leaving the country for reasons which turned out to be non-existent. He also tried to cover his tracks by way of his false messages to the officers who were reminding him of his curfew.

### Individual sentences

35     It has been held that in deciding on the appropriate sentence where several offences are involved, the court should, in general, first consider the appropriate sentence for each offence (_Seng Foo Building Construction Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 243</span> at \[23\] per Sundaresh Menon CJ).

36     First off, the sentence in respect of the charge for leaving the country on 28 Dec 2019 without approval whilst subject to supervision order, would not have been objectionable for the accused. I accepted the prosecution’s proposed sentence of a fine and the accused was given only a fine in respect of that charge. Counsel had no issues with the prosecution’s sentencing position regarding this charge and in any event, did not make any submission with respect to the said charge. I should also add that the application of the principle of deterrence does not necessarily preclude a sentence of a fine (_Yang Suan Piau Steven v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 809</span> at \[34\]).

37     Counsel also did not make any specific submission to address the court as to the appropriate individual sentences for the other two proceeded charges. In fact, counsel did not take issue with the individual imprisonment sentences proposed by the prosecution in respect of those two charges. Thus, for the FRUT charge, the learned DPP submitted for the same previous sentence in respect of the principal offence of eight months’ imprisonment. This would have been what the accused had gotten for his previous conviction for the same offence in 2016. In other words, the prosecution did even ask for the slightest uplift in sentence. The prosecution could easily and justifiably have done so following the principle of escalation. I accepted prosecution’s submission that eight months’ imprisonment would be a sufficient sentence for the principal FRUT charge.

38     As regards the additional liability under s 50T of the PA to an enhanced punishment that was tagged to the FRUT charge, I accepted, in general, prosecution’s methodology in deriving an appropriate length of imprisonment sentence, except that I discounted that period by about 10% to give more credit to the accused’s plea of guilt and his voluntary return to Singapore. I also had regard to the sentencing factors set out in s50T(3) of the PA. Thus, I considered that the offence was sufficiently serious as reflected by the length of the maximum prescribed imprisonment sentence. I also considered that the offence is the same offence for which the accused was originally sentenced and that he re-offended within such a short time after his release under the remission order.

39     Accordingly, I imposed an enhanced sentence of 300 days which was less than the 330 days sought by the prosecution. As prescribed under s 50T(5) of the PA, the enhanced imprisonment sentence “_shall run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment imposed on him._”

40     As regards the remaining proceeded charge for breach of curfew, I also accepted, in general, the prosecution’s methodology in deriving an appropriate length of imprisonment sentence, save that I discounted that period by about 10% to give more credit to the accused’s plea of guilt and his voluntary return to Singapore. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of 270 days which was less than the 295 days sought by the prosecution. I also had regard to the sentencing factors as listed in s 50Y(2) of the PA. Thus, I considered that the breach was sufficiently grave in that not only did he not return to the halfway house, he had in fact left the country and only returned after about 10 days. I also considered that he was dishonest and devious when the prison officers sent him messages to check on his whereabouts and to request him to return to the halfway house. He bought himself more time by lying to them that he would be returning soon. I further considered that the nature of the breach and the fact that the breach occurred within the same month that he was released under the remission order was a clear demonstration of the accused’ lack of commitment to his rehabilitation and reintegration into society.

### Global sentence

41     In _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”) at \[27\], Menon CJ instructed that after having decided on the appropriate sentence for each offence, it then falls on the sentencing judge to consider which of the sentences should run consecutively.

42     The central issue in this case is precisely that i.e. whether the two imprisonment terms (including the enhanced sentence) in respect of the two charges for breach of curfew and FRUT ought to run consecutively. Counsel could not have stressed enough in both his written mitigation and in his oral arguments that both offences were committed because of a single reason i.e. that the accused had left the country to see his cousin. Counsel therefore submitted that the sentences for the two charges in question should run concurrently.

43     Essentially, counsel is referring to and relying on the oft-quoted ‘one-transaction’ rule. The description of this rule in _PP v Firdaus bin Abdullah_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 225</span> at \[27\] by then Chan Sek Keong CJ is particularly apt to the present case:

> The “one transaction” rule, together with the totality principle, provides a useful guide for the court to assess whether concurrent or consecutive sentences should be imposed when an offender has done a criminal act or acts which have resulted in a plurality of offences. A related principle that should be borne in mind is where an offender is convicted of various offences arising from what is essentially one incident, his overall sentence should reflect his role and culpability in the incident as a whole. The rationale underpinning these principles is that of proportionality in punishment.

44     However, it has also been equally and often cautioned by the appellate courts that the one-transaction rule is qualified in that it is not meant to be an inflexible rule which inhibits the imposition of deterrent consecutive sentences when appropriate. Thus, it was held in _Kanagasuntharam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 2 SLR(R) 874</span> at \[6\] by then Yong Pung How CJ that the one-transaction rule is not an absolute rule and that the courts recognise that there are situations where consecutive sentences are necessary to discourage the type of criminal conduct being punished. Similarly, Rajah J pertinently observed and reiterated in _Law Aik Meng_ at \[55\] that the one-transaction rule should not be construed as a hard and fast rule rigidly applied across the board.

45     This important reminder that the one-transaction rule is necessarily limited in application was repeated more recently and expansively by Menon CJ in _Shouffee_ at \[40\]:

> \[w\]hile it may well be helpful to have regard to such factors as proximity in time, proximity of purpose, proximity of location of the offences, continuity of design and unity (or diversity) of the protected interests, in the final analysis, the consideration must be undertaken as a matter of common sense.

46     Menon CJ explained the one-transaction rule in terms of legally protected interests:[^1]

> The better articulation of the rationale for the rule is found in the principle that consecutive sentences are not appropriate if the various offences involve a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest” (see D A Thomas, _Principles of Sentencing_ (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) (“_Principles of Sentencing_”) at p 53):

>> The essence of the one-transaction rule appears to be that _consecutive sentences are inappropriate when all the offences taken together constitute a single invasion of the same legally protected interest._ The principle applies where two or more offences arise from the same facts — as when the same series of blows constitutes assault occasioning actual bodily harm and wilful ill treatment of a child, or malicious wounding and indecent assault — _but the fact that the two offences are committed simultaneously or close together in time does not necessarily mean that they amount to a single transaction._ … \[emphasis original\]

> On this formulation, the real basis of the one-transaction rule is unity of the violated interest that underlies the various offences. Where multiple offences are found to be proximate as a matter of fact but violate different legally protected interests, then they would not, at least as a general rule, be regarded as forming a single transaction.

47     His Honour also made it clear that there will be situations when it would be appropriate to run sentences consecutively even if they are for offenses that formed part of the same transaction. One such instance would be:

> where the straightforward application of the one-transaction rule results in the offender benefitting from the court's failure to have regard to the enhanced culpability that is reflected in the multiplicity of the offences that have been committed.[^2]

In addition, other situations where it would be appropriate to impose consecutive sentences, notwithstanding a deviation from the one-transaction rule, included when:

> (a)    it is necessary to do so to give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence so as to discourage behaviour of the sort in question;… or (b) the imposition of consecutive sentences would be in keeping with the gravity of the offences.[^3]

48     I was guided by the above appellate pronouncements which I applied as best as I could to the circumstances of the present accused and the facts of this case. I absolutely agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the first charge (for breach of curfew) and the third charge (for FRUT) relate to separate and distinct offences because the charges are directed at different legally protected interests. As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, the two charges involve the breach of two very different regimes serving different purposes i.e. the MAS and the drug supervision scheme. Even though both schemes may apply to the same accused as in this case, there is no question that these two schemes operate separately and independently of each other. On the one hand, the charge for breach of curfew serves to legally protect the public interest in ensuring that the accused (and other inmates) is rehabilitated and equipped with the right skill sets to enable him to be reintegrated into society. On the other hand, the charge for FRUT serves to legally protect the public interest in ensuring that the accused (and others like him) does not relapse to consuming drugs

49     In my judgment, it is necessary and justified to order the imprisonment sentences for these two charges to run consecutively so as to adequately punish the accused for (i) committing a serious breach of the MAS, (ii) committing the fresh FRUT offences (which are distinct from the serious breach of the MAS), and also to (iii) sufficiently claw back the duration of remaining remission period because of the breach of the basic condition of the remission order. These three components are distinct components which ought to be separately addressed by running the imprisonment sentences relating to each component consecutively.

50     The prosecution also referred me to the District Court decision in _PP v Muhammad Dahlan Theseira[^4]_ where the accused’s sentence for a FRUT charge (nine months’ imprisonment) plus enhanced sentence (169 days) was ordered to run consecutively with the sentence (1 year’s imprisonment) for a charge under s 50V(3)(c) of the PA for a serious breach of the MAS. Two other imprisonment sentences for offences under the Road Traffic Act and the Penal Code were also ordered to run consecutively. I would respectfully adopt the same approach and order the two sentences in question in the present case to run consecutively.

51     In any event as noted above, it is statutorily prescribed under s 50T(5) of the PA that the enhanced imprisonment sentence “shall run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment imposed on him.” Therefore, minimally, the enhanced sentence of 300 days tagged to the FRUT charge must also run consecutively with the 270 days’ imprisonment imposed in respect of the charge for breach of curfew.

52     Finally, I would like to address counsel’s point, which was put forth as a mitigating factor, that the accused did not succumb to the temptation of drugs which were readily available in Amsterdam. Even if this was true (of which there is no conclusive evidence either way), it was at best a neutral factor and could not be elevated to the status of a mitigating factor.

## Conclusion

53     Considering (i) the different and distinct legal interests underlying the two offences of breaching the curfew and for FRUT respectively and (ii) the accused’s overall culpability including his criminal history, there was more than sufficient justification to order the imprisonment sentences in respect of the two charges for the said offences to run consecutively. I had also pointed out to counsel that the aggregate imprisonment sentence in respect of the charge for breach of curfew and the enhanced sentence for the FRUT charge, was well short of the remaining duration of the remission period i.e. 667 days (from the date of the first FRUT offence) which could have been justifiably clawed back from the accused person for reoffending. As such, the present aggregate sentence that was imposed on the accused is in keeping with the totality principle and could not be said to be manifestly excessive.

54     I should also add that the fine imposed in respect of the charge for leaving the country without approval has not been paid at the time of writing these grounds. Therefore, the accused will have to serve a default sentence of three days’ imprisonment in addition to the imprisonment and enhanced imprisonment terms imposed for the other two proceeded charges.
