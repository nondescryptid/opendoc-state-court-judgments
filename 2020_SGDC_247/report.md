### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused is appealing against his conviction and sentence.

2       The Accused claimed trial to the following charge:

3       The Accused was found guilty and convicted. He was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 14 years 7 months. Due to his age, no caning or imprisonment in lieu of caning was imposed.

4       After the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Defence elected not to give evidence either by the Accused or any other witness.

5       The Defence contended that the Prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. It was submitted that the main witness called by the Prosecution was a “a dangerous witness” who was “fully capable and willing to lie both in court and to the CNB”.

## The Undisputed Facts

### Statement of agreed facts

6       The parties tendered a statement of agreed facts. The relevant portions were reproduced below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3. On 8 February 2017, at about 12.45pm, Central Narcotics Bureau ("CNB") officers arrested Rahmah somewhere in the vicinity of Ubi Avenue 1, Singapore, for dmg offences. Rahmah was subsequently brought back to her rented apartment located at No.5000N Marine Parade Road, #XXX, Lagoon View, Singapore (the "Unit"). Various drug exhibits were seized at the Unit, including one packet of granular/powdery substance, which was subsequently marked as exhibit "A1A1A".</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4. Sometime after the arrest, HTS 15 Haifaa binte Mohamed Anwar arrived at the Unit and took 32 photographs of the scene on the instructions of Investigating Officer ASP Prashant s/o Sukumaran ("ASP Prashant"). Subsequently, CNB officers brought Rahmah, as well as the exhibit marked "A1A1A", back to the CNB Headquarters. Thereat, CNB officers weighed the drug exhibits seized in relation to Rahmah's case, including the exhibit "A1A1A". HTS15 Gayathre Kalimuthu Mogan was also present, and took 50 photographs of all the exhibits seized.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5. Thereafter, the drug exhibits, including exhibit "A1A1A", were sealed in separate tamper-proof bags and kept in the custody of ASP Prashant. On 13 February 2017, ASP Prashant sent the drug exhibits, including exhibit "A1A1A" to the Health Sciences Authority (the "HSA") for analysis.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6. On 24 April 2017, HSA Analyst Lim Kheng Aik of the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, issued a certificate under s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed ("MDA"), stating that the exhibit marked "A1A1A" was found to be one packet containing not less than 385.8g of granular/powdery substance, which was pulverized and homogenized into a powdery substance, and which was then analyzed and found to contain not less than 8.87g of diamorphine (Lab No. ID-1732-00266-001).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7.

### Other undisputed facts

7       It was also not disputed that the POLCAM video recording of the vicinity of Block 301 Ubi Avenue 1, Singapore, recorded on 7 February 2017 showed the presence of the Accused and one Rahmah Bte Rahmat (PW1). See exhibit P87.

## Evidence of Rahmah Bte Rahmat (PW1)

8       PW1 was sentenced in April 2018 to 22 years’ imprisonment for the offence of drug trafficking. She was still serving her sentence when she gave evidence for the Prosecution.

9       PW1 testified that she collected the heroin on 7 February 2017 from the Accused and she had ordered “1 batu”. Heroin is a well-known street name for diamorphine.

10     Upon her arrest on 8 February 2017 in the vicinity of Ubi Avenue, PW1 was brought to her rental Unit where the drug (exhibit A1A1A) was found. She testified that the said drug was bought from Nasser (identified to be the Accused) for $3,300 on 7 February 2017.

11     The drug exhibit A1A1A was wrapped in newspaper and placed inside a white plastic bag. PW1 then unpacked it and packed it into A1A1 and thereafter placed into exhibit A1A as shown in exhibit P34. See also exhibit P35 showing exhibits A1A1A, A1A1 and A1A.

12     Exhibit P87 was a video recording of the vicinity of Block 301, Ubi Avenue on 7 February 2017 (the “Block”). The video footage was screened in court. At the time frame 12:23:05 of the video footage, PW1 identified the person wearing the red T-shirt as Nasser. PW1 confirmed that she was also captured in P87 at timestamp 12:21:11. PW1 also said that having collected the plastic bag containing the drug from the Accused, she left the Block.

13     P87 showed that PW1 came into possession a white plastic bag (the “bag”) which she said was passed to her by Nasser at the corner of Block 301. PW1 confirmed that inside the bag was exhibit A1A1A.[^1] PW1 also confirmed that before receiving the white plastic bag she had given to Nasser an envelope containing $3,300.

## Evidence of Prashant s/o Sukumaran (PW2)

14     PW2 was a CNB officer for about 5 years. He was the investigation officer for this case. He testified that “1 batu” referred to heroin weighing about 450gm.

15     PW2 acknowledged that the DNA profiles of PW1 and one Zuhaila were found on the drugs seized. He confirmed that Zulaiha’s DNA was found only on the exhibit labelled, Z-A1C, which is exhibit P70. PW1’s DNA were found on a number of drug exhibits seized.

## Election by the Accused

16     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Accused elected to remain silence after the usual allocution was administered. He also did not call any other witness.

## Analysis of PW1’s Evidence

17     Counsel for the Defence submitted that PW1 was a liar and that it was unsafe to rely on her evidence to convict the Accused.

18     Having heard and seen the Accused giving evidence as well as considering the submissions of the parties, I found that the discrepancies in the evidence of PW1 did not affect the core of her testimony that she handed $3,300 to the Accused and received the drug contained in the bag. I assessed her evidence in relation to the elements of the charge against the Accused to be “usually convincing” such that the case was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In this respect, I considered PW1’s demeanour and both the internal and external consistencies of her evidence. There were discrepancies in her evidence. However, I concluded that the inconsistencies did not go to the root of her credibility. My reasons were stated below.

19     PW1, despite the rigorous cross-examination in court, maintained that she bought the heroin from the Accused.

20     I found that the evidence of PW1 as to what happened on 7 February 2017 in the vicinity of the Block was consistent with the video footage exhibit P87. It corroborated her evidence that she collected the bag said to contain exhibit A1A1A. It was also without doubt that the Accused was present at the material time.

21     PW1’s evidence that she bought the heroin from the Accused was consistent with her statement given on 14 February 2017 (exhibit D2).

22     As the Accused chose to remain silent, there was no evidence adduced to contradict the account given by PW1.

23     Next, I agreed with Prosecution that PW1 had adequately explained the reason for the inconsistency between her contemporaneous statement (exhibit D1) and her oral testimony. In exhibit D1, question 7 and answer 7, PW1 told the recorder that the drugs were bought from one ‘Raju’. However, in court, PW1 testified that she purchased it from the Accused. PW1 explained that she lied in exhibit D1 because she “wanted to save someone”, and that she only decided to tell the truth when confronted with the still images of the CCTV footage capturing her and the Accused, as well as the plastic bag.[^2] Being confronted with this evidence, clearly PW1 knew that she was unable to shield the Accused any further and had to tell the truth.

24     Admittedly, PW1 also gave contradictory evidence in relation to the source of exhibit marked “E3A1” (P54). However, this was not the subject matter of the charge against the Accused. In any event, she explained the reason for lying was to help Nasser.[^3]

25     The Defence submitted that PW1 had no reason to lie to protect the Accused as they were merely friends. However, it should be noted that there was evidence to suggest that PW1 had treated the Accused favourably to the extent of allowing him to stay at her place for free. There was no reason not to believe PW1 that she lied to protect the Accused even though they were only friends.

26     I rejected the submission made by the Defence in respect to the colour of the plastic bag. I found that PW1 corrected herself immediately and before exhibit P87 was played in court.[^4] Clearly, she was not tailoring her evidence as to the colour of the bag.

27     With due respect to counsel, I did not find anything wrong for PW1 to repack the drug bought from the Accused and to throw away the bag and the newspaper wrapping. As highlighted by the Prosecution in the written submissions at \[27\], “_all of the drugs found in her Unit_, as seen from the photographs, had similarly been repacked into smaller packets. The fact that Rahmah had therefore chosen to repack the Drugs after collecting them is therefore nothing out of the ordinary”.

28     Next, counsel suggested that there was no reason for PW1 to buy the drug as she already had a large quantity of drugs shown in P39, P47 to P49, P54, P59, P60 and P62. Hence, it was doubtful that PW1 had bought the drug in question from the Accused on the 7 February 2017. I disagreed. At best this was a neutral factor. In any event, I noted that these drugs were procured before her arrest. There could also be multiple reasons for PW1 to stockpile the drugs.

29     In these circumstances, there was no reason for me to reject in total all the evidence of PW1. The fact that PW1 was found to have lied on a matter, it did not mean that her credibility had been affected as a whole. See _Ng Kwee Leong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 281</span> at \[15\].

## My Findings

30     For the reasons given above, I accepted the evidence of PW1 that she had purchased the drug exhibit A1A1A from the Accused on 7 February 2017. The fact that the Accused had elected to remain silence fortified my finding.

31     I was of the view that there was no reason for PW1 to falsely implicate the Accused. The Accused having elected to remain silence, had not procured any evidence to suggest a motive for PW1 to fabricate the evidence against the Accused. There was no evidence that PW1 bore any ill-will towards the Accused. On the contrary, there were evidence to suggest that PW1 was trying to shield the Accused from other offences by lying to the CNB officer.

32     I agreed with the Prosecution that the suggestion that the other characters raised in PW1’s testimony, i.e., “Kecik”, “Yana”, “Raju”, and “Gopal”, could have been the “real culprit”, was mere speculation not supported by evidence.

33     I also found that the Accused had not provided any reasons to explain his presence at the Block on 7 February 2017. PW1 flatly denied that on 7 February 2017 the Accused met her to pass cigarettes to her. This was not contradicted by the Accused himself.

34     As stated at \[27\] above, I accepted the evidence of PW1 that she had thrown away the plastic bag and the newspaper wrapping which were used to contain the drug in question. There was no reason for PW1 to keep the plastic bag and the newspaper wrapping after she had repacked the heroin. Having repacked the heroin, it was therefore, not surprising that the Accused’s DNA could not be found.

35     There was no submission by the Defence that the Accused had no knowledge of the nature of the drug in question. On the other hand, there was evidence that PW1 paid $3,300 to the Accused for the heroin.

## Adverse inference for failure to give evidence

36     Based on the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, it clearly called for an explanation by the Accused as to why he was present on the material day and place in question in the presence of PW1. But the Accused elected to remain silence. Hence, I concluded that the Accused had no explanation to offer and led me to the irresistible inference that he was guilty of the offence as charged.

37     In the circumstances and also having considered the evidence of PW1 and the exhibits tendered in court, I was satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the Accused was guilty of the charge and convicted him.

## Antecedents

38     The Accused had a string of drug related antecedents. In 2010, he was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 5 years 3 months with 3 strokes of the cane for drug trafficking. In 2016, he was convicted of drug consumption and sentenced to a LT2 imprisonment term of 7 years 4 months and 6 strokes of the cane.

## Submissions on Sentence

39     The Defence submitted for an imprisonment term of between 12 to 13 years. Bearing in mind the age of the Accused, counsel urged the court not to impose a very lengthy sentence. Counsel also urged the court to allow the sentence to commence from 16 September 2020, the date of sentencing. Counsel also submitted for the court to consider the period of remand from April 2017 to August 2017 (the “remand period”) which was said not to have been accounted for previously.

40     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment and had no objection for the sentence to take effect from 16 September 2020. But this sentence was to be moderated to 14 years 7 months to take into account the remand period indicated by the Defence.

41     In support of the sentencing position, the learned DPP referred to the case _Soh Qiu Xia Katty v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 568</span> which modified the sentencing framework laid down in _PP v Lai Teck Guan_ \[2018\] 5SLR 852 but not the principles. In that case, the appellant, aged 22 years at time of offence, pleaded guilty to one charge of trafficking in 9.98g of diamorphine. Five other drug related charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The court opined that the appellant would receive a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment if she was a notional first-time offender. In the circumstances of that case, the appellant being a repeat offender, the indicative starting sentence was 17 years’ imprisonment. After taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors, the appellant was sentenced to 15 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the drug trafficking charge.

## Sentence

42     Considering the sentencing precedents submitted by the Prosecution, clearly the sentence for a repeat offender who trafficked 8-9g of diamorphine and with minimum indicative uplift would face an imprisonment term of at least 14 years to about 15 years. See _Soh Qiu Xia Katty_, _supra_, at \[44\]. In this case, the quantity of diamorphine was 8.87g which was close to 9g, the Accused would receive a sentence of 10 years to not more than 11 years of imprisonment if he was a notional first offender. See _Soh Qiu Xia Katty, supra_, at \[38\] and \[44\].

43     Having considered the circumstances of the repeat offence, I was of the view that an indicative uplift would be between 4-7 years as per \[42\] of _PP v Lai Teck Guan, supra_.

44     I considered the Accused’s culpability, the aggravating factors and mitigation. I noted the Accused had his first drug conviction in 1999 for drug possession and consumption. The Accused’s last trafficking offence was committed in 2010 and he was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 5 years 3 months and 5 strokes of the cane. Despite the various imprisonment terms imposed, he still continued to re-offend repeatedly for drug consumption. In 2016, the Accused was convicted and given a LT2 imprisonment of 7 years 4 months and 6 stokes of the cane (DAC 936903/2015) for drug consumption. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. He was granted bail pending appeal in October 2016. He was on bail pending appeal when he committed the present offence of drug trafficking on 7 February 2017, and the offence of repeat drug consumption on 18 April 2017 (DAC 927270/2017). The Accused’s appeal in respect of DAC 936903/2015 was dismissed on 18 August 2017 by the High Court and the sentence was ordered to commence on 18 August 2017.

45     On 26 April 2018, the Accused was convicted of 2 offences for repeat drug consumption (DAC 927270/2017) and failure to provide urine specimen for urine test, an offence under section 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (DAC 936910/2015). The sentences for these 2 offences were ordered to run concurrently. In total, the Accused was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment which was ordered to run concurrently with the sentence in DAC 936903/2015 imposed on 18 August 2017 by the appellate court.

46     The Accused’s bail pending appeal for DAC 936903/2015 was revoked on 20 April 2017 and was ordered to be remanded at A Division for investigation. He was then remanded in the Prison from 24 April 2017 to 18 August 2017.

47     Clearly the Accused was a recalcitrant without any regard for the law and had progressed to commit a more serious offence of drug trafficking. In my view, a deterrent sentence was warranted. Accordingly, I applied an uplift of 5 years.

48     I noted that the prescribed punishment for the offence committed by the Accused was a minimum mandated sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane and a maximum mandated sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. In the present case, the Accused was not liable for caning due to his age. There was also no submission on a term of imprisonment in lieu of caning.

49     I also considered the lack of remorse on the part of the Accused and the lack of any mitigating factor.

50     Considering the aggravating factors at \[44\] above and the lack of mitigating factor, I sentenced the Accused to an imprisonment term of 14 years 7 months after deducting the remand period and also his initial remand period from 16 October 2015 to 17 November 2015. There was no indication that the High Court in dismissing his appeal on 18 August 2017 had taken his remand period into consideration. In any event, I ordered the sentence to take effect on the day he was sentenced and not from the expiry of his previous term of imprisonment for his other offences. His sentence could have been ordered to start after the expiry of the previous imprisonment term as the offence was distinct from the present offence. In this respect, as highlighted by the learned DPP, the sentence imposed was already on the lenient side.

## Conclusion

51     In my view, the sentence of 14 years’ 7 months’ imprisonment was warranted to take into account the Accused’s overall criminality.

52     The Accused is now serving his sentence.
