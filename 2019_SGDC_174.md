\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9194/2019/01\]

23 August 2019

### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

## Introduction

The Accused is a 50-year-old male Singaporean. He pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 3 of the Vandalism Act[^1] (“the Act”). He had unscrewed a tap (valued at S$171.20) from a police station toilet and made off with it. I sentenced him to 3 months’ imprisonment.

2       The Accused, who is currently serving his prison term, has appealed against his sentence.

## Facts

3       The following facts are gleaned from the Statement of Facts, which the Accused admitted to without qualification.

4       On 1 March 2019, the Accused was at the Woodlands Police Division Headquarters to bail his brother out. Sometime after midnight, the Accused was using the toilet within the police station when he noticed that a tap attached to the basin was loose. Upon examining the tap, he realised that it was suitable for the basin in his home toilet. The Accused then formed the intention to steal the tap, despite knowing that it was public property belonging to the Government. He proceeded to unscrew the tap from the basin, before bringing it home.

5       Subsequently, the cleaning supervisor discovered that the tap was missing and reported this to the police station’s facility manager. Footage retrieved from a CCTV camera within the vicinity caught the Accused in the act of unscrewing the tap and taking it away.

6       The Accused’s identity was ascertained by subsequent investigations. On 16 April 2019, a raid was conducted at the Accused’s residence, where the stolen tap was found affixed to the toilet basin.

7       The Accused was charged as follows:

> You … are charged that you, on the 1st day of March 2019 at or about 00.14 a.m., at the level 3 Lift Lobby 2 Toilet located at … Woodlands Police Division, Singapore, did commit an act of Vandalism, to wit, by unscrewing the tap from the basin with the use of your hands and stealing the said one basin tap valued at SGD $171.20/-, which is a public property belonging to Woodlands Police Division, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 2 punishable under Section 3 of Vandalism Act, Chapter 341.

## The Accused’s Antecedent History

8       The Accused has previous convictions for property-related offences:

> (a)     In April 2006, he was convicted of one count of lurking house trespass / house-breaking by night, under s 456 of the Penal Code,[^2] for which he was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 2 years and 4 months.

> (b)     In June 1996, he was convicted of 4 counts of lurking house trespass / house-breaking,[^3] under s 454 of the Penal Code, and one count of lurking house trespass / house-breaking2 by night, under s 457 of the Penal Code, for which he was sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 3½ years.

> (c)     In September 1987, he was placed on probation for one count of theft under s 379 of the Penal Code.

9       The Accused is also traced for various unrelated offences. Specifically, he was convicted:

> (a)     in July 2001 for driving while under disqualification,[^4] under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act;[^5]

> (b)     in November 2002 for unauthorised possession of methamphetamine, under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act;[^6] and

> (c)     in August 2008 for drink driving, under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act..

## Parties’ Position on Sentence

10     At the first mention of this matter on 5 July 2019, the Accused indicated that he will plead guilty if he is only getting a fine. The Prosecution responded that it was not agreeable to this, upon which the Accused said that he needed 4 weeks to consult a lawyer. I granted the adjournment.

11     At the subsequent mention date on 15 August 2019, the Accused was still unrepresented by counsel. The Prosecution indicated that it will be seeking an imprisonment term of 3 months. After that indication was made known to the Accused, he elected to plead guilty.

12     In its submissions on sentence, the Prosecution explained that the 3-month imprisonment term which it sought comprised two parts:

> (a)     2 months’ imprisonment for the offence; and

> (b)     1 month’s imprisonment in lieu of the caning which would have otherwise been imposed, but for the Accused being 50 years of age.

13     In his mitigation, the Accused pleaded for a lighter sentence. He explained that ever since his mother passed away, he has been living with his younger brother, who is a mental patient and who, being unemployed, needs to be cared for by the Accused.

## Sentence

14     Section 3 of the Act stipulates that an offender shall be punished for an “act of vandalism”. This term is in turn defined by s 2 of the Act as follows:

> “act of vandalism” means —

>> (a)    without the written authority of an authorised officer or representative of the Government or of the government of any Commonwealth or foreign country or of any statutory body or authority or of any armed force lawfully present in Singapore in the case of public property, or without the written consent of the owner or occupier in the case of private property —

>>> (i)    writing, drawing, painting, marking or inscribing on any public property or private property any word, slogan, caricature, drawing, mark, symbol or other thing;

>>> (ii)   affixing, posting up or displaying on any public property or private property any poster, placard, advertisement, bill, notice, paper or other document; or

>>> (iii)   hanging, suspending, hoisting, affixing or displaying on or from any public property or private property any flag, bunting, standard, banner or the like with any word, slogan, caricature, drawing, mark, symbol or other thing; or

>> (b)     **_stealing_**, destroying or damaging **_any public property_**[^7] … \[emphasis added\]

In the present case, the applicable limb of the above definition is in subsection (b), i.e. “stealing … any public property”. Specifically, paragraph 10 of the Statement of Facts states:

> … the accused has thereby committed an offence of Vandalism, by unscrewing the basin tap from the sink and **_stealing the … basin tap …, which is … public property_** belonging to the Government, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 3 of the Vandalism Act … \[emphasis added\]

15     As regards the applicable punishment, s 3 of the Act reads:

> Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, any person who commits any act of vandalism or attempts to do any such act or causes any such act to be done shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, and shall also, subject to sections 325(1) and 330(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68), be punished with caning with not less than 3 strokes and not more than 8 strokes except that the punishment of caning shall not be imposed on a first conviction under this Act in the case of any act falling within —

>> (a)    paragraph (a)(i) of the definition of “act of vandalism” in section 2, if the writing, drawing, mark or inscription is done with pencil, crayon, chalk or other delible substance or thing and not with paint, tar or other indelible substance or thing; or

>> (b)    paragraph (a)(ii) or (iii) of that definition.

Thus, stealing of public property under limb (b) of the definition of ‘act of vandalism’ attracts mandatory caning. The Prosecution’s starting premise is that the appropriate sentence for the offence in the present case would have been at least 2 months’ imprisonment _plus_ caning.

16     In assessing the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, there were two precedents which I found to be of some assistance.

17     The first is _Mohd Suief bin Ismail v PP_ (MA 191/91) (“_Mohd Suief_”), cited in _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013). The salient aspects of _Mohd Suief_ are set out below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="52.94%"> <col width="19.34%"> <col width="27.72%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Facts</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Antecedents</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Outcome</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The offender, who was just under 21 years of age at the time of the offences, removed water meters belonging to the Public Utilities Board from public housing blocks, before selling off the copper parts.

_Mohd Suief_ is relevant as the act of vandalism there was, as with the present case, constituted by theft of public property. However, the facts in _Mohd Suief_ were more aggravating than the present, in that:

> (a)     the public property stolen was of a higher value ($500, as opposed to $171.20 in the present case); and

> (b)     a total of 17 items were stolen in that case, compared to only a single tap here.

I was thus of the view that the imprisonment term in the present case should be lower than the 3-month term imposed in _Mohd Suief_, although not by much, given that there are some aggravating factors in the present case which were absent in _Mohd Suief_. Specifically, the offender in _Mohd Sueief_ had a clean record, while the Accused in the present case is traced for multiple (albeit somewhat dated) property-related offences. More importantly, the Accused’s actions entailed a much higher degree of audacity, having been committed within the very grounds of a police station.

18     In this respect, the next precedent is pertinent as it (as with the present case) involved an act of vandalism committed against fixtures in a police station. The salient aspects of this second case, _PP v Mohammed Mushtaq Khan Swati_ (SC-909029-2017, unreported) (“_Mohammed Mushtaq_”), are set out below:

Given that the value of the property damaged in _Mohammed Mushtaq_ ($1,236.96) was much higher than the value of the tap in this case ($171.20), the sentence here will of course have to be tapered down accordingly.

19     As with both the precedents cited above, the Accused pleaded guilty. While an early plea of guilt may demonstrate remorse, it would not hold much sway if the evidence against the offender is overwhelming: see _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] SGHC 79</span> (at \[14\]). Here, the Accused person was caught on video unscrewing and stealing the tap. Thereafter, the police found the tap attached to the Accused’s home toilet. As far as criminal cases go, the evidence does not get very much more overwhelming than that. Accordingly, I placed little mitigating weight on the plea of guilt.

20     Looking at the facts in their totality, I am of the view that the 2-month imprisonment term sought by the Prosecution is appropriate. I also see no reason to go beyond the minimum number of strokes of the cane, i.e. 3 strokes, this also being what was imposed in both _Mohd Suief_ and _Mohammed Mushtaq_.

21     This leads to the next point: the Accused cannot be caned, as s 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code[^8] (“CPC”) prohibits caning if the offender is 50 years of age as at the point when the strokes are to be inflicted. This then calls into play s 325(2) of the CPC, which provides:

> … if a person is convicted of one or more offences punishable with caning (referred to in this section as the relevant offences) but the person cannot be caned because subsection (1)…(b) applies, the court may, in addition to any other punishment to which that person has been sentenced, impose a term of imprisonment of not more than 12 months in lieu of the caning which it could, but for this section, have ordered in respect of the relevant offences.

22      _In Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 215</span> (“_Amin bin Abdullah_”), the High Court was faced with an offender who, having been sentenced to 15 strokes of the cane, was subsequently found to be medically unfit for caning. Sundaresh Menon CJ, in delivering the judgment of the court, observed that the starting point is that an additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning should _not_ be imposed, unless there are grounds for doing so. This would be the case even if caning is a mandatory part of the sentence: see _Amin bin Abdullah_, at \[54\].

23     The court in _Amin bin Abdullah_ nevertheless observed (at \[59\]) that an additional imprisonment term may be imposed if there is a need to, _inter alia_, compensate for the deterrent effect that is lost by the avoidance of caning. To this end, the court highlighted (at \[62\]) that it is helpful, firstly, to identify the principal sentencing objective underlying the imposition of caning for the offence in question. The court observed (at \[63\]):

> ... **_deterrence is likely to be the dominant sentencing consideration behind the imposition of caning for offences that impact public order_** and social safety, such as serious drug and moneylending offences … \[emphasis added\]

24     Insofar as the class of vandalism perpetrated by the Accused is concerned (i.e. stealing or damaging public property), the dominant consideration underlying the mandating of caning _was_ deterrence. At the Second reading of the Punishment for Vandalism Bill in 1966 (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_, 26 August 1966, vol 25), then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had this to say:

> **_Recently the problem has been complicated by the ease of access to public property which, in the nature of things, is difficult to prevent._** Thefts of fountain heads made of copper, copper tubes outside Housing and Development Board premises used for boilers and other things … . **_I do not think we can allow this to go on_**, and I know how strongly the profession and the penologists are against caning. But we have a society which, unfortunately, I think, understands only two things - **_the incentive and the deterrent_**. We intend to use both, the carrot and the stick. ... \[emphasis added\]

In rounding off the debates, then Minister for Law E. W. Barker concluded:

> Members will, I am sure, agree that **_it is imperative to make provision in the law for deterrent punishment_** which this Bill now before the House seeks to do. **_I need hardly say that the existing punishment_** provided for such offences is, … **_a fine_** not exceeding $50, and has in the present context **_proved to be wholly inadequate as a deterrent measure_**.

> …

> … **_The punishment of caning has been introduced advisedly and after considerable thought. It has been found in practice that while many convicted persons will accept without demur a heavy fine or even a lengthy sentence of imprisonment, they tend to view with the greatest alarm and despondency any sentence which requires the infliction of caning_**. … \[emphasis added\]

25     Given that the deterrent effect which the legislature intended to convey by mandating caning is lost here (the Accused having avoided caning by virtue of his age), the question arises as to whether I should exercise the discretion to make up for that lost deterrent effect, by uplifting the imprisonment term. In _Amin bin Abdullah_, the High Court explained (at \[65\] - \[69\]) that in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it is important to take account of (_inter alia_) **_why_** the offender managed to avoid caning. The court in _Amin bin Abdullah_ explained:

> 66    … We are here addressing, in particular, the sentencing objective of general deterrence which looks to deter other like-minded individuals, who are similarly situated as the offender before the court, from engaging in similar conduct. **_The key question is whether such potential offenders would have known before committing the offence that by reason of their own circumstances, they would be exempted from caning. If so, then an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning may be more readily seen as necessary or appropriate in order to compensate for the general deterrent effect lost because the offender knows he or she will be exempted from caning_**. If, on the other hand, the exemption was unexpected in the circumstances, then there would not be a similar need to replace the lost deterrent effect of caning because the prospect of caning would nonetheless have been contemplated by such would-be offenders, even if it might subsequently transpire that they will not be caned.

> 67     **_In general, an offender who was exempted from caning due to gender or age is likely to have known from the outset that he or she would not be caned. Therefore, for this class of exempted offenders, an additional term of imprisonment will be more readily seen to be called for, in order to compensate for the lost deterrent effect of caning_**. Conversely, an offender who was exempted from caning on medical grounds is less likely to have known that he would not be caned. Therefore, it would generally not be necessary to enhance the sentences of such offenders. … \[emphasis added\]

26     As such, the need to compensate for the deterrent effect that is lost by the avoidance of caning is more pertinent in cases such as the present, where the offender would have _known_, as at the point of committing the offence, that he is not liable for caning. The Accused in this case had already hit his 50th birthday when he removed the tap from the police station. Without any additional bite to compensate for the deterrent effect that is lost by the avoidance of caning, offenders in similar positions as the Accused may face less compunction about embarking on their vandalising spree.

27     Even then, it is necessary to further consider whether the additional imprisonment term imposed will be _effective_ in replacing the deterrent effect of caning. In this respect, the court in _Amin bin Abdullah_ explained (at \[69\]) that a key factor is the length of the imprisonment term that the offender will already be serving, sans any uplift imposed pursuant to s 325(2) of the CPC. If that imprisonment term is particularly long, any uplift imposed to purportedly compensate for the loss of caning may be relatively marginal by comparison, and therefore not particularly meaningful in making up for the deterrent effect that would otherwise have subsisted had caning been allowed. Thus, in _Cheang Geok Lin v PP_ \[2018\] SGHC 05, the High Court opined (at \[16\]) that imposing an additional imprisonment term of 12 weeks would not have meaningfully compensated for the deterrent effect of caning when the offender was already facing a mandatory minimum prison term of 7 years for the offence in question.

28     Reverting to the instant case, as I had explained at paragraph 20 above, the imprisonment term that should be imposed is 2 months. This duration is not so long as to render the additional term (imposed to compensate for the deterrent effect that is lost by the avoidance of caning) insignificant. That additional term, which I have determined to be one month (see the paragraph immediately below), is likely to have tangible impact as it is comparatively significant when juxtaposed against the 2-month imprisonment term. I thus agreed with the Prosecution that an additional imprisonment term should be imposed, to compensate for the deterrent effect that would have come into play had caning been permissible.

29     As regards the quantum of the additional imprisonment term, the court in _Amin bin Abdullah_ held (at \[89\]) opined that this should bear some correlation to the number of strokes that the offender managed to avoid (although the court explicitly declined to go so far as to adopt a pro-rated approach). The court thus set out the following indicative guidelines:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="42.38%"> <col width="57.62%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>No. of strokes avoided</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Imprisonment in lieu of caning</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 - 6 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 3 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 - 12 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 - 6 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 - 18 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 - 9 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">≥ 19 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9 - 12 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

As explained at paragraph 20 above, I would have been minded to impose the minimum of 3 strokes in this case, if the Accused had been eligible for caning. Bearing in mind the table above, I decided that an additional one month’s imprisonment should be imposed pursuant to s 325(2) of the CPC (over and above the 2-month imprisonment term) to compensate for the avoidance of the 3 strokes.

## Conclusion

30     I thus sentenced the Accused to a global term of 3 months’ imprisonment.
