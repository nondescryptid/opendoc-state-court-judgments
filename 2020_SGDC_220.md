3       The Accused admitted to and consented to having 22 other forgery and cheating charges under the Penal Code taken into consideration.

4       The Prosecution is dissatisfied with the sentence.

## Facts

5       The majority of the forgery and cheating offences were committed by the Accused in his capacity as a relationship manager at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (“OCBC”) when he was in their employment from 1 April 2014 to 10 March 2019. Even after he stopped working at OCBC on 10 March 2019, the Accused continued to represent himself as an OCBC relationship manager in order to continue deceiving his victims.

6       To appreciate the full flavour and extent of the criminality of the Accused’s conduct, the facts relating to the charges are set out in some detail below.

### Forgery Charges

#### Facts relating to DAC 924534/2019

7       The victim for this charge is Ms Sit Swee Yin (“Ms Sit”). In early March 2019, the Accused messaged Ms Sit to inform her of a time deposit promotion with OCBC, promising interest rates of 8.88% per annum. Ms Sit was interested in investing in this time deposit.

8       On or about 15 March 2019, Ms Sit met with the Accused at her flat. Ms Sit issued an OCBC cheque number 000037 for $150,000 for the purpose of investing in the said OCBC time deposit. When Ms Sit asked the Accused who she should write as the payee, the Accused asked Ms Sit to leave the payee blank. When Ms Sit insisted on writing a payee, the Accused wrote two alphabets, “O” and “C” with some space between the two letters, as the payee. The Accused informed Ms Sit that this meant OCBC bank. Subsequently, without Ms Sit’s knowledge or consent, the Accused altered the cheque such that the “O” and “C” became “Quek Chin Hong”. Quek Chin Hong (“Mr Quek”) was another of the Accused’s clients. He was also one of the Accused’s victims.

9       The Accused altered OCBC cheque number 00037 with intent to defraud Ms Sit. Instead of using the $150,000 to invest in the OCBC time deposit, the Accused banked in the OCBC cheque number 00037 into Mr Quek’s POSB account number XXX (“Mr Quek’s POSB Account”). Subsequently, Mr Quek transferred the $150,000 to the Accused on the Accused’s instructions.

#### Facts relating to DAC 924536/2019

10     The victim for this charge is Ms Lam Wai Cheng Valerie (“Valerie”). She was 59 years old at the time of the offence. On 11 March 2019, the Accused messaged Valerie to ask her if she was interested in investing in an OCBC time deposit promotion offering interest rates of 8.88% per annum. Valerie replied saying she was.

11     On 26 March 2019, the Accused met Valerie at her residence. Valerie issued a DBS cheque number 859833 for $50,000 for the purpose of investing in the said time deposit. Valerie signed the cheque but left the payee section of the cheque blank. The Accused told Valerie to leave the payee blank and that he would complete it for her. Valerie trusted the Accused and handed the cheque over to the Accused with the payee left blank. Subsequently, without Valerie’s knowledge and consent, the Accused wrote in the payee as one “Liow Xiu Ren”. The Accused altered DBS cheque number 859833 with intent to defraud Valerie. Liow Xiu Ren was a person the Accused owed monies to. Instead of using the $50,000 to invest in the OCBC time deposit as Valerie intended, the Accused handed the cheque over to Liow Xiu Ren to settle his personals debts.

#### Facts relating to DAC 934120/2019 and DAC 934121/2019

12     The victim for these charges is Mok Lai Fun Aida (“Aida”). She was 62 years old at the time of the offence. On or about 25 March 2019, the Accused messaged Aida and informed her of a promotional time deposit with OCBC, offering interest rates of 8.88% per annum. The Accused told Aida that the promotion would only last for a week. Aida informed the Accused that she was willing to invest $200,000 into this time deposit.

13     On 27 March 2019, Aida met the Accused at her house. Aida issued two cheques: (a) DBS cheque number 892769 for $100,000, and (b) DBS cheque number 892770 for $100,000. The Accused instructed Aida to fill in the payee on these cheques as “O C” with a space in between the two letters. Aida trusted the Accused and filled in the payee as “O C” on both cheques before handing the cheques over to the Accused. Subsequently, without Aida’s knowledge or consent, the Accused altered the payees on the two cheques from “O C” to “Quek Chin Hong”. The Accused altered the cheques with intent to defraud Aida. The Accused never invested the $200,000 in the time deposit. Instead, he deposited the $200,000 into Mr Quek’s POSB account and instructed Mr Quek to transfer this sum to his bank account.

#### Facts relating to DAC 934123/2019

14     The victim for this charge is Heng Chiang Hock (“Mr Heng”). He was 66 years old at the time of the offence. Sometime in February 2019, the Accused informed Mr Heng of a time deposit with OCBC which offered interest rates of 4.08% per annum. Mr Heng indicated he was interested in investing in this time deposit.

15     On 26 February 2019, Mr Heng met with the Accused. Mr Heng issued a POSB cheque number 808584 for $100,000, intending to invest this $100,000 in the said OCBC time deposit. The Accused asked Mr Heng to write the payee as “O C” with a space in between the two letters. Mr Heng trusted the Accused and wrote the payee as “O C” before handing the cheque to the Accused. Subsequently, without Mr Heng’s knowledge or consent, the Accused altered the payee of the cheque from “O C” to “Quek Chin Hong”. The Accused altered the cheque with intent to defraud Mr Heng. The Accused never invested the $100,000 in the time deposit. Instead, the Accused deposited the $100,000 into Mr Quek’s POSB Account. The Accused subsequently instructed Mr Quek to transfer monies from Mr Quek’s POSB account to the Accused’s own account.

#### Facts relating to DAC 934125/2019 and DAC 934126/2019

16     The victim for these charges is Vivian Oh Kah Leng (“Vivian”). On 11 April 2019, the Accused contacted Vivian and informed her of an OCBC time deposit promotion. Vivian said she was inclined to invest.

17     That same day, Vivian met the Accused at the Food Republic at Shaw House. Vivian brought with her, among other things, two cheques: (a) UOB cheque number 195632 for $100,000, and (b) UOB cheque number 195633 for $100,000. The Accused asked Vivian to write the payee on both cheques as “OC”. The Accused told Vivian that “OC” was a special OCBC account for the time deposit. Subsequently, without Vivian’s knowledge or consent, the Accused altered the payees on the two cheques from “OC” to “TAN BOCK SAY”. Tan Bock Say is the Accused’s father.

18     The Accused altered the cheques with intent to defraud Vivian. The Accused never invested the $200,000 from the two cheques in the time deposit. Instead, he deposited the $200,000 into his parents’ POSB joint account number XXX (“Accused’s Parents’ Joint Account”).

### Cheating Charges

#### Facts relating to DAC 934110/2019

19     The victim for the following charges is Bonnie Chen Yan (“Bonnie”), a 51 year old Singaporean.

20     In or around February 2018, the Accused informed Bonnie of a BGF Dynamic High Income Fund with OCBC. Bonnie indicated to the Accused that she wished to invest $57,000 in this fund. The Accused instructed Bonnie to transfer the $57,000 to an OCBC account number XXX under the name of Kuang Min Tai (“Kuang’s OCBC Account”). The Accused informed Bonnie that in order to invest in the fund, she had to transfer the $57,000 to Kuang’s OCBC Account. The Accused knew this information was false and intended to deceive Bonnie. Bonnie trusted the Accused and on or about 2 March 2018, transferred $57,000 to Kuang’s OCBC Account. In reality, Kuang Min Tai (“Mr Kuang”) was the Accused’s friend. Subsequently, on the Accused’s instructions, Mr Kuang transferred the $57,000 to one of the Accused’s bank accounts. The Accused never invested the $57,000 in the fund. Instead, he used the monies for his personal purposes, including gambling.

#### Facts relating to DAC 934113/2019, DAC 934114/2019, DAC 934116/2019 and DAC 934117/2019

21     Between June 2018 and March 2019, the Accused informed Bonnie of various OCBC time deposit promotions which offered high interest rates but were only open for a limited period of time. The Accused told Bonnie that he had used his own monies to contribute to these OCBC time deposits on her behalf in order to meet the promotion deadline. The Accused then asked Bonnie to return him these sums of money by transferring the amounts to his bank accounts or his brother, Tan Keat Xian’s bank account.

22     In fact, the Accused intended to deceive Bonnie. He never used his own monies to invest in OCBC time deposits on Bonnie’s behalf. By this deception, on four different occasions, the Accused induced Bonnie to deliver the following amounts to him or his brother: $57,000, $100,000, $50,000 and another amount of $50,000.

23     The Accused used the monies obtained on the first three occasions for his personal purposes, including gambling. For the later sum of $50,000, the Accused asked his brother to transfer $39,910 to his bank account and subsequently gambled this amount away. The Accused asked his brother to transfer the rest of the $50,000 to other persons he owed monies to. None of the monies was used to invest in OCBC time deposits.

### CDSA charge

#### Facts relating to DAC 902525/2020

24     Some of the monies obtained by the Accused from his criminal conduct were first transferred or deposited into the intermediary bank accounts of Kuang Min Tai (the Accused’s friend), Tan Keat Xian (the Accused’s brother), the Accused’s parents and also Mr Quek Chin Hong. The Accused then acquired these benefits from criminal conduct through fund transfers from these intermediary bank accounts to his own bank accounts[^1].

25     In the premises, on 15 occasions between January 2018 and April 2019, the Accused acquired a total of $943,853 which directly represents his benefits from criminal conduct. The Accused would give various fictitious reasons to the owners of the above intermediary bank accounts as to why monies were being deposited or transferred to their accounts. The Accused would then instruct the owners of the intermediary accounts to transfer the monies to his own accounts. For example, the Accused informed Mr Kuang and Mr Quek that he needed their help to receive monies from his clients which he could not receive in his personal bank account. He would then instruct them to transfer the monies back to him.

### Other Relevant Facts

26     The total amount involved in all the charges was a sum of $2,090,000. The Accused used some of the monies he cheated from his later victims to pay back his earlier victims. The Accused did this to evade being found out, so that he could continue cheating victims. This way, he repaid $500,000 to three of his victims, telling these victims that the monies were investment returns. The total unmitigated losses to the victims therefore amount to $1,590,000.

27     Other than the $500,000 he returned to three of his victims, the Accused used the rest of the monies for his personal purposes. This included gambling and returning monies to persons he owed debts to.

28     There were a total of eleven victims. Of these eleven victims, five were 60 years old and above at the time of the offences.

## Antecedents

29     The Accused is untraced.

## Mitigation

30     Leaving aside the submissions on the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the various charges, Defence Counsel gave the court an insight into the Accused’s background – his family, education and a brief history of how the Accused got involved in online gambling, which eventually led him to commit the offences in desperation.

31     Defence Counsel stressed that even though the total amount involved in the proceeded charges was $2.09 million, the net loss or harm caused in this case was $1.59 million since $500,000 had been paid to some victims. Further, at the time his scam unravelled, the Accused was in Malaysia. Defence Counsel submitted that the Accused voluntarily contacted the police and returned to Singapore to surrender himself. The Accused co-operated fully with the police and was forthright in his dealings with the Investigating Officer. The Accused continued to demonstrate his remorse for his actions by pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity.

32     I accepted the mitigating points put forth by Defence Counsel and bore them in mind as I considered the appropriate sentence in respect of the individual charges.

## Decision on Sentence

### Aggravating Factors

33     In considering the gravity of the offences before me, I was mindful of the aggravating factors, as highlighted by the Prosecution[^2]. These were largely undisputed by the Defence[^3]:-

> (a)     The offences involved a significant amount of $2.09 million, and were committed over a period of more than one year, with multiple victims;

> (b)     The Accused abused the trust of his victims. He was their relationship manager at OCBC and had leveraged on his position and taken advantage of the relationship in committing the offences. His clients trusted him to the extent that they would hand him a blank cheque and/or would write the payee in the form as he instructed them to. One of the victims even transferred the monies to him directly, believing that he had used his own funds to invest on her behalf;

> (c)     The offences were pre-meditated. The Accused approached his clients with well thought-through plans. For some, he would ask for blank cheques; for others he convinced them to write the letters “O” and “C”, telling them it stood for ‘OCBC” or saying that it was a special OCBC account for time deposits. The Accused was comprehensive in his planning as he then made use of intermediary bank accounts to receive the monies of his victims, giving various fictitious reasons to the owners of these bank accounts before asking them to transfer the monies to him;

> (d)     There was an element of public interest involved. The fraudulent acts committed by the Accused carried the potential of affecting the integrity of Singapore’s financial institutions and systems.

34     I noted that out of the Accused’s 11 victims, five were elderly i.e. above 60 years old. I considered that great harm had been caused to them, not only in terms of the monetary amounts but also in terms of the distress they would suffer from their financial affairs becoming more precarious in their advanced years, as Prosecution put it. Having said that, I did not accept the Prosecution’s added layer of submission that the Accused had targeted elderly victims. There was no evidence on the material before me to substantiate that.

### Approach to Sentencing

35     In a case such as this where the offender had been convicted of multiple charges, the approach would be a two-stage one. As stated in the case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span>, at \[18\]:

> “The proper approach to determining the aggregate sentence in cases involving multiple offences was set out in my judgment in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”). There, I said that the sentencing judge must begin by deciding the appropriate individual sentence in respect of each charge, and in doing so, he must consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon the sentence for each charge (at \[26\]). Having done this, the sentencing judge must then consider which of the sentences should run consecutively (at \[27\]). In doing this, he must have due regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle (at \[27\] and \[47\]), which are discussed in the judgment and need not be elaborated here.”

36     I first considered the appropriate sentence for the individual charges.

### Forgery charges under section 467 of the Penal Code

37     The Prosecution and Defence sought these sentences in respect of the forgery offences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.5641128225645%"> <col width="37.3874774954991%"> <col width="42.0484096819364%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sum involved</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Prosecution’s Proposed Sentence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Defence’s Proposed Sentence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$50,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 16 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$100,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 years 9 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$150,000</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 years’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 36 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

38     In arriving at their proposed sentence, the Prosecution relied on a single case of _PP v Yak Puay Khim_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 85</span>, a case where the offender was an accounts clerk for four companies run by her family. She forged the signatures of the authorised signatories on company cheques and obtained payments for herself. In this case, _Yak_ was sentenced to two years and six months’ imprisonment for section 467 Penal Code charges involving sums of $100,000 to $111,140. For a charge involving $266,273.67, the court sentenced her to three years’ imprisonment. On appeal, the sentences were affirmed. Based on the sentences imposed in _Yak Puay Khim_, the Prosecution sought higher sentences on the individual forgery offences (as reflected in the table above) due to more aggravating factors being present in the current case than in _Yak Puay Khim._

39     The Defence, on the other hand, referred to the case of _PP v Wong Huey Min_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 287</span> in arriving at their proposed sentence. The offender in _Wong Huey Min_ pleaded guilty to 20 out of 159 charges under section 467, Penal Code. She was an accounts executive who misappropriated approximately $1.67 million over six years and four months by forging the managing director’s signature 159 times, issuing cheques to herself or her husband. She was the main person in charge and was fully entrusted with the accounts. She also went to significant lengths to avoid detection. Extrapolating from the Prosecution’s sentencing submissions in _Wong_’s case, Defence Counsel formulated sentencing bands which would apply to the current case as a starting point[^6]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="57.14%"> <col width="42.86%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Amount</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$50,000 and $59,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$60,000 and $69,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$70,000 and $79,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$80,000 and $89,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$90,000 and $99,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$100,000 and $109,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">26 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$110,000 and $119,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$120,000 and $129,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$130,000 and $139,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">32 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$140,000 and $149,999</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">34 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$150,000 and $159,999</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

40     I was cognisant that Prosecution’s sentencing submissions in _Wong Huey Min_’s case were based on the facts and circumstances in _Wong_’s case. Defence urged the court to impose lower sentences than the sentencing bands developed above (reducing the sentence by two months per charge), on the basis that there were significant differences in culpability between the offender in _Wong_ and the Accused[^7].

41     I did not fully agree with Defence Counsel that the Accused’s culpability was lower than the offender in _Wong Huey Min_. Although the Accused’s offending was for a relatively shorter period of time and he faced fewer charges, the harm caused was to several victims in the form of his clients in the bank, not corporate entities as in _Wong_’s case. The amount of trust reposed in him as relationship manager by his clients was great. The level of pre-meditation on the part of the Accused, particularly in him having to cook up stories to convince his victims why they should be writing cheques in a particular way so he could forge them subsequently, was also higher than that in _Wong_.

42     The Prosecution did not agree with the Defence’s proposed sentencing bands, extrapolated from _Wong Huey Min_. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) urged the court to rely on the sentence of two years and six months’ imprisonment imposed on a charge with the precise amount of $100,000 in _Yak Puay Khim_ as the better precedent[^8], the sentence having been affirmed in the High Court as well. However, as I perused the written grounds of judgment by the lower court in _Yak Puay Khim_, I was unable to discern how the court arrived at the sentence of two years and six months for an individual charge involving a sum of $100,000. The discussion on sentences in the lower court, including precedents, appeared to have been focused on the appropriate global sentence to be imposed. There were also no written grounds issued when the sentences were affirmed on appeal. For those reasons, I was reluctant to rely on the sentence imposed in respect of the sum of $100,000 in _Yak Puay Khim_ in arriving at the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the individual charges in my Accused’s case.

43     Notwithstanding the above, I noted that the sentence imposed in _Yak Puay Khim_ of two years and six months’ imprisonment for a sum of $100,000 was not at odds with the sentencing bands proposed by the Defence. In the proposed table, the indicative sentence for a sum of $100,000 was 26 months’ imprisonment i.e. two years and two months’ imprisonment. The facts of the case in _Yak Puay Khim_ were more aggravated than the facts in _Wong Huey Min_, in terms of the amount of monies involved and the number of charges, hence justifying a sentence higher than the indicative sentence.

44     I was comfortable with the sentencing bands proposed by Defence Counsel. I did not see the need to reduce or increase the indicative imprisonment terms set out in the sentencing bands for the forgery charges the Accused was convicted on. The quantum of loss aside, I was mindful of the aggravating facts in this present case and as mentioned earlier, I did not consider his culpability lower than the offender in _Wong Huey Min_. However, unlike the offender in _Wong_, I did find genuine remorse expressed by the Accused and accorded that some weight. Therefore, on the forgery charges, I was of the view that these sentences would be appropriate:

> (a)     For the charge involving $150,000 – 36 months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     For the charges involving $100,000 – 26 months’ imprisonment;

> (c)     For the charge involving $50,000 – 16 months’ imprisonment.

### Cheating charges under section 420 of the Penal Code

45     The Accused was convicted on five charges under section 420 of the Penal Code. The sums involved in the cheating charges were $50,000, $57,000 and $100,000.

46     Prosecution relied on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Emeline Tang Wei Leng_ (DAC 945496/2017 and others) to submit for a sentence of 15 months to two years’ imprisonment on the cheating charges[^9]. As described by the DPP, the offender in _Emeline Tang_ was also a banker who cheated her relatives and their friends by deceiving them that the bank offered promotional fixed deposits and induced them to transfer around $5 million to her. She was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment on section 420 Penal Code charges involving $60,000 to $86,962; and two years’ imprisonment for amounts from $100,000 to $150,000.

47     Defence Counsel was not in disagreement with the Prosecution on their sentencing position, apart from adding that the level of culpability in _Emeline Tang_ was higher than the current case[^10]. At their end, the Defence tendered the cases of _Public Prosecutor v Gene Chong_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 117</span> and _Public Prosecutor v Yap Bin Chun_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 89</span>. Based on the cases and considering the Accused’s culpability, Defence Counsel submitted that the appropriate sentence for the Accused would be between 18 to 33 months’ imprisonment for the cheating charges[^11].

48     I noted that the facts surrounding _Emeline Tang_ and the present Accused’s case were largely similar. Having regard to the cases cited by both the Prosecution and Defence, I was of the view that Prosecution’s proposed sentences on the cheating charges were fair and appropriate in these terms:-

> (a)     For the charges involving $50,000 - 15 months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     For the charges involving $57,000 – 15 months’ imprisonment;

> (c)     For the charge involving $100,000 - 24 months’ imprisonment.

### Section 47(1)(c) CDSA charge

49     The charge under this section was an amalgamated one involving a total of $934,853, representing the benefits which the Accused acquired from his criminal conduct on 15 different occasions.

50     The Prosecution sought a term of three years’ imprisonment based on an unreported case of _Public Prosecutor v Chow Lai Hoong_ (DAC 916880/2015 and others). In that case, the offender had converted $722,350 of her criminal proceeds into casino chips and was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment.

51     On the other hand, the Defence cited four reported cases[^12]:

> (a)      _Public Prosecutor v Yap Chee Yen_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 219</span>. The offender was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment on each charge under the CDSA. The total sum involved for the CDSA offences was US$812,000 and $599,191 and he had a total of 18 CDSA charges (including those taken into consideration);

> (b)      _Public Prosecutor v Sally Low Ai Ming_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 110</span>, where the offender, a financial advisor, received a sentence of three years’ imprisonment for a CDSA charge in the sum of $5.28 million. She had three more charges under the CDSA taken into consideration and also pleaded guilty to cheating charges under section 420 of the Penal Code;

> (c)      _Public Prosecutor v Lim Seng Soon_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 102</span>, where the offender faced a total of 16 offences under the CDSA. The total amount involved was $2.27 million. The offender was sentenced to between 10 to 24 months’ imprisonment for various amounts. The sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment was in respect of a CDSA charge involving $478,000.00.

> (d)      _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Kay Keng Matthew_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 425</span>. The offender was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment for each CDSA offence, amongst criminal breach of trust offences. The total amount involved in the seven proceeded CDSA charges was $858,759. There were a further 18 charges under the CDSA taken into consideration.

52     Defence Counsel submitted that based on the precedents, and the culpability of the offenders compared with the Accused, a sentence in the range of 12 to 24 months’ imprisonment would be fair.

53     Considering the authorities cited, there did not seem to be a clear pattern in the sentences imposed on CDSA charges. To further illustrate, in _Public Prosecutor v Ng Ting Hwa_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 147</span>, a case mentioned in _Yeo Kay Keng Matthew_, the offender was sentenced to one and a half years’ imprisonment for a CDSA charge involving $1.9 million. I further observed that amongst the case precedents, there were multiple CDSA charges in some cases i.e. the amounts representing the benefits derived from the offender’s criminal conduct, were not amalgamated into a single CDSA charge, as it was done in this current case. That may possibly explain the lower sentences imposed in each CDSA charge in those cases.

54     In the current case, the Prosecution had chosen to amalgamate the benefits obtained by the Accused into a single CDSA charge of a large amount of $934,853. Whilst I recognised that the CDSA charge did flow from the Accused’s forgery and cheating offences, it was ultimately a distinct offence which represented the Accused’s planned and deliberate conduct in concealing his illegal proceeds obtained from his wrongful acts of cheating and forgery. Prosecution stressed that in _Lim Seng Soon_, the sentence of two years’ imprisonment for a CDSA charge of $478,000 was affirmed by the High Court. The amount in the CDSA charge which Accused pleaded guilty to was more than double the amount in _Lim Seng Soon_. I accepted the Prosecution’s point and I was of the view that a sentence of three years’ imprisonment would not be inappropriate in the circumstances.

### Aggregate Sentence

55     At the second stage of the analysis, I considered which of the sentences were to run consecutively given the totality of the circumstances. I was mindful that the offences were serious and the amount involved was substantial. Deterrence would be the key sentencing objective in this case.

56     The Prosecution sought an aggregate sentence of eight years and six months’ imprisonment, with the sentences in four charges to run consecutively. Defence Counsel proposed an aggregate sentence of between six to seven years’ imprisonment for the Accused, with three of the sentences to run consecutively. I was of the preliminary view that the sentences in each offence type i.e. forgery, cheating and CDSA, and that involving the largest amount of monies, would run consecutively. If so, the total sentence would be one of 96 months’ imprisonment, or eight years imprisonment.

#### Quantum of loss

57     The amount involved in the charges is $2.09 million. It was not disputed that $500,000 was repaid to three of the victims[^13]. I was in full agreement with the Prosecution that the $500,000 which was repaid to the victims was motivated, not by remorse but by “_self-preservation_”, in the words of the DPP[^14]. I did not consider the restitution of $500,000 as evidence of remorse. Having said that, I was mindful that “restitution of any kind” would be relevant.

58     In the case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne_ at \[63\], the High Court reminded:

> “….. Restitution is not necessarily limited in its significance to being evidence of remorse. In my judgment, it may also indicate that the economic harm that the victim has suffered has been reduced, and indeed, substantially reduced if full restitution was made”.

59     At \[65\], the court continued:

> “ Likewise, in _Fernando_ (\[42\] _supra_), Rajah J observed that the extent of loss or damage actually suffered as a result of the offence was relevant to sentencing. Hence, where there had been no loss or minimal loss because the offender was apprehended and the proceeds of crime recovered, that would affect the sentence to be imposed (at \[49\]). While he acknowledged that restitution is of mitigating value mainly because it reflects true remorse, he also opined that “restitution of any kind” would be relevant, and referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in _R v Debra Jane Mitchell_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] WASCA 299</span>, where it was held that making good the loss that the victim had suffered was a mitigating factor because it reduced the harm to the victim”.

60     Whilst not evidence of remorse, the fact remained that the economic harm suffered by the victims had been reduced. I accepted Defence’s submission that the net and actual loss caused was only $1.59 million[^15]. I bore that in mind as I considered the appropriate aggregate sentence in this case. The amount of wrongful gain accruing to the Accused through illegal means would be a key factor in this consideration, against a backdrop of facts unique to the Accused’s case.

#### Global sentence imposed in precedent cases

61     In considering the appropriate aggregate sentence, I had regard to the global sentence imposed in precedent cases. I was mindful that the precedent cases were varied in terms of the type and nature of charges, the number of charges as well as the facts surrounding the commission of the offences. However, I was of the view that the aggregate sentences imposed, particularly in relation to the sums of monies involved in those cases, would provide a good flavour of the range of aggregate sentences and would be relevant in my consideration of the appropriate aggregate sentence for the Accused in this present case.

62     It was observed by the court in the case of _Yap Chee Yen_ at \[11\] that subject to distinguishing factors, based on sentencing precedents which concerned bank relationship managers or bank officers implicated in a myriad of offences such as theft as a servant, criminal breach of trust (“CBT”), cheating, forgery and/or CDSA charges in the tune of millions, the sentence imposed ranged from five years six months’ imprisonment for a loss of $1.7 million, seven years and six months’ imprisonment for a loss of $1.9 million to eight years and six months’ imprisonment for a loss of about $2.135 million.

63     From the Prosecution’s table of precedents[^16], I also observed the global sentences imposed:

> (a)      _PP v Emeline Tang_ – the offender received 10 years six months’ imprisonment for an amount of around $5.2 million involved in all the charges; unmitigated losses amounting to about $4.4 million;

> (b)      _PP v Yak Puay Khim_:  the sentence was seven years six months’ imprisonment for an amount of about $4.7 million; unmitigated losses of about $4.06 million;

> (c)      _PP v Chow Lai Hoong_ - for a total loss of almost $2.4 million, the offender (who had a previous conviction for CBT) received a term of seven and a half years’ imprisonment; and

> (d)      _PP v Jaslyn Chen_ (DAC 918469/2016 and others) – a sentence of six years and nine months’ imprisonment for a total loss of about $1.25 million where $271,000 was recovered.

64     In _Sally Low_, Defence Counsel highlighted that the offender received a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment for causing net losses of $3.81 million and this was a plea of guilt entered only after trial had commenced[^17].

65     In particular, I draw out two cases. In _Yap Chee Yen_, the offender was also a relationship manager who was convicted of five forgery charges under section 468 of the Penal Code, one cheating charge under section 417 of the Penal Code as well as three charges under CDSA (22 other charges were taken into consideration). The court imposed a global sentence of five years and six months imprisonment (about 66 months’ imprisonment) for losses amounting to about $2.48 million, with a net loss of $1.95 million. On appeal, the global sentence of the offender was reduced to 56 months’ imprisonment.

66     The other case is that of _Lim Seng Soon_. In this case, the amount cheated of a single victim was $2 million. On appeal, the offender’s original sentence of six years was reduced to four and a half years’ imprisonment, largely on account of full restitution having been made. In _Public Prosecutor v Tan Chong Wei_ (DAC 18217/2011 & others), a case cited at \[9\] of _Lim Seng Soon_, the offender was also a relationship manager who was convicted of 11 charges under section 420 of the Penal Code and four charges under CDSA. He was sentenced to a total of seven years for charges which involved a sum of about $3.6 million plus EUD$88,122 and the amount recovered/restituted was about $65,000.

67     In this consideration, I accepted Defence’s submission that in several of these precedents (_Yap Bin Chun, Gene Chong, Lim Seng Soon, Sally Low, Emeline Tang_), and particularly the last two cases of _Yap Chee Yen_ and _Tan Chong Wei_, certain aggravating features such as an abuse of trust, degree of planning involved, were already factored into the sentences arrived at in those cases. The offenders in the cases of _Yap Chee Yen_, _Lim Seng Soon_ and _Tan Chong Wei_ were also all relationship managers. Defence Counsel urged the court to caution itself against “double counting”, having considered the precedents in the determination of the individual sentences[^18].

#### Decision on sentence

68     Having regard to the precedents, I was of the view that a global sentence of about seven years’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence in the Accused’s case. This aggregate sentence was in line with the precedents in respect of the total loss/harm caused, which in this case, as mentioned was $1.59 million. Considering the totality of the circumstances in this present case, it was a sentence proportional to the overall criminality and culpability of the Accused. This aggregate sentence would not be substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed and would also not be a crushing sentence on the Accused, who prior to this, had a clean record. I was of the view that the aggregate sentence of eight years and six months sought for by the Prosecution was excessive and unsupported by precedent.

69     In order to arrive at the appropriate aggregate sentence, I thus adjusted the sentence on the CDSA charge to one of 24 months’ imprisonment. In summary, I imposed the following sentences:
