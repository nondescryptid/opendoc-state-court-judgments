### Principal District Judge Victor Yeo Khee Eng:

## Introduction

The Accused, Lim Kim Heng, claimed trial to a charge of having obtained credit by way of a personal loan, a sum of $100,000 from one Ang Yee Lim (“Mr Ang”) on or about 7 January 2013 without informing Mr Ang of his status as an undischarged bankrupt. This is an offence under s 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20, 2009 Rev Ed).

2       At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and accordingly, I found the Accused guilty of the charge. He was sentenced to **six (6) weeks’ imprisonment**. The Accused being dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence filed an appeal against both conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

3       These are the grounds for my decision.

## The Charge

4       The proceeded charge read as follows:

> 1st Charge (MSC-901298-2018)

> are charged that you, having been adjudged a bankrupt on 3 November 2006, did, on or about 7 January 2013, obtain credit for a sum of S$100,000.00 from one Ang Yee Lim, without disclosing to Ang Yee Lim that you are an undischarged bankrupt and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20), Revised Edition 2009 and punishable under Section 146 of the same Act.

## The Undisputed Facts

5       It was undisputed that the Accused was adjudged a bankrupt on 3 November 2006 and he remained as an undischarged bankrupt at the time of the alleged offence, i.e. on or about 7 January 2013.

6       The Accused was aware that it is an offence to obtain credit without disclosing his status as an undischarged bankrupt. He received the Bankruptcy Information Sheets, as evidenced by exhibit P1B, which amongst his other duties and responsibilities, informed him that it is an offence to obtain credit without disclosing his status as an undischarged bankrupt.

7       At the request of the Accused, Mr Ang issued a crossed UOB Cheque No. 023066 for $S100,000 (exhibit P3) dated 7 January 2013 made payable to one Ng Chee Yong (PW3) which was banked into the latter’s bank account.

## The Prosecution’s Case

8       The prosecution’s case is that the Accused was introduced to Mr Ang by a business partner, one Mr Chen Po On sometime in the year 2012 to venture into the F&B Industry in China. Sometime in January 2013, the Accused had called Mr Ang (PW2) and requested for a loan of $100,000/-. According to Mr Ang, the Accused had told him that he needed to repay a friend that he had owed money, and that he needed to do so before the Chinese New Year. Mr Ang agreed and issued a crossed UOB cheque no. 023066 made payable to one Ng Chee Yong (“Mr Ng”) on or about 7 January 2013.

9       The Accused provided Mr Ng’s name and NRIC number to Mr Ang. Mr Ang gave evidence that he did not know who Mr Ng was. Mr Ang testified that his personal assistance prepared a debt acknowledgement (exhibit P4, “**IOU**”) of the interest free friendly loan, on or about 12 Feb 2013, and that sometime between 5th and 7th March 2013, he went to Chongqing, China to meet up with the Accused, who then signed P4.

10     At this juncture, I should mention that the Consultant Forensic Scientist, Yap Bei Sing, who examined the specimen signatures of the Accused stated that he is unable to ascertain whether the signature in the IOU belong to the Accused. The Accused denied having signed the IOU. As such, there is no conclusive evidence to show that the Accused did or did not sign the exhibit P4.

11     When the Accused failed to return the $100,000/- loan, Mr Ang commenced legal action against the Accused and obtained judgment against the Accused. Mr Ang testified that it was only after his lawyer conducted a bankruptcy search that he discovered that the Accused was an undischarged bankrupt. Mr Ang then lodged a complaint with the Insolvency Office.

12     The prosecution called Mr Ng as a witness (PW3). According to Mr Ng, he came to know the Accused through a colleague sometime between 2009 or 2011 as they wanted to venture into F&B business in China and the Accused was in China and in the F&B business.

13     Mr Ng testified that sometime in December 2012, he transferred a sum of RMB 500,000 to the Accused’s personal account in China as a temporary loan to the Accused. He later sent an email to the Accused, whom he addressed as “Jon” on 28 December 2012 to inform him of the transfer of RMB 600,000 (which included an earlier loan of RMB 100,000) and requested the Accused to make arrangement for the sum of S$120,000. The Accused acknowledged the remittance and said that he would arrange the S$120,000 by Monday.

14     Mr Ng confirmed that he had received the sum of S$100,000 deposited into his bank account. Mr Ng testified that at the material time, he did not know Mr Ang nor the identity of the person who deposited the S$100,000 into his bank account. However, Mr Ng confirmed that he had received the repayment for the loan which he had given to the Accused.

## The Case for Defence

15     The case for the defence is that the sum of S$100,000 deposited into Mr Ng’s bank account was in substance a repayment by Mr Ang to Mr Ng. At the material time, the company EYF (BJ) Pte Ltd (“EYF”) in China were in debts and arrears, and there were urgent payments that needed to be made. Mr Ang then asked the Accused to see if he could help find someone who could remit money. The Accused then called Mr Ng, who had been consulting the Accused about business in China, and Mr Ng agreed to help by lending the money to EYF.

16     The loan was received by the Accused into his personal China Construction Bank (“CCB”) account from Mr Ng. Mr Ang would then repay Mr Ng for the loan to EYF that was effected through the accused’s CCB account instead of directly into EYF’s account from overseas to avoid the need for approval from the Chinese authorities.

17     According to the Accused, Mr Ang had repaid S$100,000 into Mr Ng’s bank account in Singapore. Another $20,000 was repaid to Mr Ng in China in the form of RMB100,000 some two to three months later.

18     The Accused denied having signed the debt acknowledgement. He denied having received any letter of demand from Mr Ang or any Writ and Statement of Claim from Mr Ang’s lawyers. He was unaware of the judgment entered against him. The Accused further produced alibi evidence that he could not have signed the debt acknowledgement in Chongqing as claimed by Mr Ang, as the Accused was in Guangdong during that period with Mr Ng and his team for business.

19     The defence case is that Mr Ang had brought the false allegations and fabricated the “loan undertaking” against the Accused by manipulating and depicting that the $100,000 payment to Mr Ng was a loan to the Accused. The defence alleged that Mr Ang was angered with the Accused after the Accused stood up to him in mid-2013. Mr Ang felt that the Accused had gone behind his back and arranged payments to the staff for salary arrears in accordance with his duties as legal representative. His standing up to Mr Ang and responding to the law office letter had caused Mr Ang to ‘lose face’.

20     The defence further submitted that there is a strong basis to believe that Mr Ng had been in contact with Mr Ang, and that Mr Ng had lied in court because he was upset with the Accused due to his own business issues in China or that his objectivity had been tainted by Mr Ang.

## Assessment of the Evidence

21     At the end of the trial, the main issue to be determined by this court is a question of fact, i.e. whether the Accused had obtained credit in the sum of S$100,000 from Mr Ang without disclosing that he was an undischarged bankrupt.

22     This in turn depended on the court’s assessment of the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses, the Accused and the defence witnesses. In this regard, I should state that I did not agree with the learned Defence Counsel’s reference to the Raffles Town Club’s case in the defence submission against Mr Ang’s credibility. I was of the view that the RTC case has no relevance whatsoever to the present proceedings, and I did not think that it was appropriate for the learned counsel to use that case to attack Mr Ang’s character and credibility. In my view, it would be more helpful for counsel to focus and submit on the relevant evidence adduced before the court, which I shall now turn to.

#### Assessment of Mr Ang’s evidence

23     Having carefully considered all the evidence adduced, I found Mr Ang’s evidence of the loan to the Accused to be credible and cogent, and is supported by the evidence. I note that Mr Ang has been consistent in his testimony that the Accused had approached him for a loan of S$100,000 to repay Mr Ng, and that the Accused had also signed the debt acknowledgement. This was also consistent with his letter of demand to the Accused, and his Statement of Claim in respect of the civil suit against the Accused. He eventually made the complaint to the Insolvency Office when he subsequently discovered that the Accused was an undischarged bankrupt.

24     In this respect, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that it would not be logical for Mr Ang to pursue the repayment of his debt through legal action against the Accused if the debt declaration signed by the Accused had been a false document. In my view, Mr Ang’s actions subsequent to the discovery of the Accused’s bankruptcy status were entirely consistent with someone who had not known that the person he was dealing with was an undischarged bankrupt until he was informed of this by his lawyers.

25     As testified by Mr Ang, he would not have agreed for the Accused to be the legal representation of the company if he had known that the Accused was an undischarged bankrupt. Neither would he have engaged a lawyer to take legal action against the Accused to recover the money. I saw no reason to disbelieve Mr Ang on this point.

26     While the learned counsel had cross-examined Mr Ang extensively about the debt acknowledgement, and sought to raise the alibi that the Accused could not have signed the debt acknowledgement as claimed by the witness, this was not put to Mr Ang by the defence during cross-examination. Furthermore, it was clearly refuted by Mr Ng that the Accused had remained in Guangzhou at the material time to help Mr Ng’s team with the business.

27     I found Mr Ang’s explanation that he regarded the Accused as a business partner and was in charge of the operations in China as their legal presentative, and hence, he did not commence legal action to recover the personal loan until much later as he felt that the company’s matters were more important than the personal loan, to be reasonable.

28     I was mindful that the business relationship in China between Mr Ang and the Accused had soured, and that Mr Ang was obviously unhappy with the Accused over this. I was also alive to the learned counsel’s submissions that Mr Ang had fabricated evidence and lied in order to falsely implicate the Accused as the Accused had angered Mr Ang and caused him to “lose face”.

29     However, having carefully considered the evidence, I assessed Mr Ang to be a credible witness and I accepted Mr Ang’s testimony that the $100,000 was a personal loan to the Accused to repay a friend.

30     My view is further fortified when I considered Mr Ng’s evidence. While I agreed with the learned defence counsel that Mr Ng appeared to be a very reluctant witness, and at times, an uncooperative witness during the giving of his testimony, I found no reason to disbelieve Mr Ng when he gave evidence that he had extended a temporary loan to the Accused as a gesture of goodwill as he had plans to venture into the China market. Mr Ng’s evidence that he did not know Mr Ang at the material time, was also consistent with the testimony provided by Mr Ang.

31     In this respect, I agreed with the prosecution that there was no basis for the defence to allege that Mr Ng had colluded with Mr Ang to lie in court that they do not know each other and falsely implicate the Accused, or that Mr Ng is upset with the Accused due to his own business issues in China. The undisputed evidence was that the loan which Mr Ng had extended to the Accused in China had been repaid in full and there would be no reason for Mr Ng to collude with Mr Ang to frame the Accused.

32     Furthermore, there was no mention whatsoever that the loan taken from Mr Ng which was deposited into the Accused’s personal bank account had any involvement with Mr Ang or EYF, notwithstanding the Accused had transferred the RMB 600,000 into EYF’s account. In the same vein, it was also not disputed that the said monies were transferred into the Accused’s personal bank account instead of EYF’s account. If the loan was taken up on behalf of Mr Ang or EYF, there was no reason why the Accused did not tell this to Mr Ng or have the funds deposited into EYF’s account, but instead deposited into the Accused’s personal bank account. Hence, I saw no reason to disbelieve Mr Ng when he testified that the loan was extended to the Accused.

#### Assessment of Accused’s evidence

33     I next turn to the defence’s case. Having carefully considered the Accused’s defence, I did not find his evidence to be credible, and I disbelieved his defence.

34     First, I was not persuaded by the Accused’s denial that he did not sign the debt acknowledgement dated 12 February 2013, or his explanation for the belated filing of the police report that he did not sign the said IOU, which in my view, was clearly an after-thought to bolster his defence.

35     The evidence revealed that during the course of the investigations, sometime in May 2016, the Accused had sight of the debt acknowledgement which bore his signature. However, the police report was filed by the Accused on 22 April 2019 where he claimed that he did not have any recollection of signing the IOU. This was some 10 months after he was charged in court on 18 June 2018 for the offence.

36     In my assessment, I found Mr Ang’s account of how the debt acknowledgement came about and the confirmation of the Accused’s instructions to issue an amount of $100,000 to Mr Ng and deposit the said amount into Mr Ng’s UOB bank account, and how the Accused came to sign on the IOU to be more credible and believable.

37     Moreover, in the Accused’s police report (exhibit D12), he stated that the money (i.e. $100,000) was loaned from Mr Lawrence Ang, his business partner, and that the said amount was deposited to Mr Ng, who was his friend. The reason for depositing the money to Mr Ng was to convert into RMB for use in their business in China. However, Mr Ang left the business in late 2013 and the Accused was left to handle the company.

38     This was quite different from the essence of the Accused’s defence, which was that he merely acted as a liaison between Mr Ang and Mr Ng in connection with the loan for the urgent purpose of settling the debts of EYF. However, when I considered the evidence of Mr Ang and Mr Ng, I was not convinced that the Accused had merely “brokered” a loan between Mr Ang and Mr Ng, without each knowing the existence of the other person, or the stated purpose of the loan, and which loan was facilitated using the Accused’s personal bank account to transfer the funds.

39     In this respect, I found the Accused’s explanation that this was to overcome the formalities of the transfers of money in China domestically between personal accounts to corporate accounts, or from an overseas account to be somewhat contrived. It was further contradicted by the evidence of the two prosecution witnesses. As explained by Mr, Ang, there was no reason why he could not have remitted monies over to EYF account directly if fresh funds were needed.

40     Further, I did not accept the Accused’s explanation about the circumstances of the loan that he had obtained from Mr Ng, which monies were transferred into his personal bank account. In my assessment, the Accused’s testimony about how Mr Ng had wanted the loan to be repaid in terms of the currency in S$ and RMB was not credible at all. The Accused’s evidence appeared strained and tailored in order to explain away the S$100,000 that was to be credited into Mr Ng’s bank account in Singapore using Mr Ang’s personal cheque.

41     Other than the Accused’s own self-serving account of the transfer of these monies, which was contradicted by Mr Ng, there was nothing to support his claims that Mr Ng had requested for the repayment of RMB 600,000 loan to be on those terms (i.e. S$100,000 plus RMB 100,000). On the contrary, Mr Ng merely asked the Accused to make arrangements for the S$120,000 which the Accused said he would arrange by the following Monday.

42     Similarly, I found it rather unusual that there was nothing in writing to support the Accused’s claim that Mr Ang had asked the Accused to borrow money to settle EYF debts, or that Mr Ang was even aware that the Accused had transferred money into EYF’s account. There was also nothing in writing to substantiate the Accused’s version that the loan which Mr Ng had transferred into the Accused’s personal bank account was in connection with EYF’s debts on behalf of Mr Ang, and that Mr Ang would be the person returning the money to Mr Ng.

43     As stated above, if the Accused’s version were to be believed, it was as if the Accused had merely acted as a liaison between Mr Ang and Mr Ng for the purposes of settling the debts of EYF, without each knowing the existence of the other person, or the stated purpose of the loan, and which loan was facilitated using the Accused’s personal bank account to transfer the funds.

44     In short, I did not find the Accused to be a credible witness. I was not persuaded by the Accused’s defence, which in my view, was clearly against the weight of the evidence adduced by the prosecution. In my view, there was no basis for the defence to allege that Mr Ang and Mr Ng had both colluded and lied in order to falsely implicate the Accused when they do not even know each other prior to this incident.

45     I was mindful that Mr Ang and the Accused’s business relationship in China had deteriorated, which eventually led to Mr Ang to take legal action and lodging a complaint with the Insolvency Office. However, I accepted Mr Ang’s testimony when he denied that he had an improper motive to falsely implicate the Accused. As for Mr Ng, who had transferred RMB 600,000 into the Accused’s personal bank account, he was repaid the loan and I found no reason to disbelieve his account of the loan and repayment.

46     I do not propose to go into the details of the evidence of the Accused’s wife, Mdm Neo Sok Tin (DW3, “**Mdm Neo**”) or Mr Chen Poh On (DW2, “**Mr Chen**”), save to observe that their evidence did not detract from my assessment of the material evidence and key findings.

47     Mr Chen knew the Accused when he was preparing to launch the Food Republic business in China. When Mr Chen left Food Republic to start his own restaurant business, Mr Ang was one of those who invested and collaborated with Mr Chen. Mr Ang gave Mr Chen a lot of authority and in turn, Mr Chen asked the Accused to take charge of the Chongqing restaurants.

48     This was not inconsistent with Mr Ang’s testimony who maintained that he had left it to Mr Chen to take charge of the operations in China and he could not recall the specific details of the employees hired by Mr Chen or EYF. Mr Ang maintained that he did not blame Mr Chen or the Accused for their business losses as it was normal to have profits and losses in businesses. He further maintained that there was no cash flow difficulties and agreed that they suffered losses in the businesses.

49     As for Mdm Neo, the crux of her testimony was that she and her children did not receive any court documents meant for the Accused and that there were no occasions when someone came to their house to serve court documents during January or February 2015. If she had received such documents, she would have notified the Accused when he was in China. She further testified that she had not applied to the court to set aside the court judgment against the Accused as she did not have the financial means to do so.

50     Her evidence was to refute any suggestion by Mr Ang that there was any attempt at personal service of any Writ of Summons and to explain the reason why there was no application made to set aside the judgment. However, as reasoned above, I found Mr Ang’s account of his attempts to recover the loan from the Accused and the subsequent discovery of the Accused’s bankrupt status to be credible, and I did not place much weight on Mdm Neo’s testimony.

## Conclusion

51     Having carefully considered all the evidence adduced, and having carefully considered the parties’ respective submissions and replies, I was satisfied that Mr Ang was a credible witness when he testified that the Accused had obtained a loan of S$100,000 from him without disclosing to Mr Ang that he was an discharged bankrupt.

52     Accordingly, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and I found the Accused guilty of the charge.

## The Sentence

53     Having convicted the Accused of the single charge of having obtained credit by way of a personal loan, a sum of $100,000 from Mr Ang without informing Mr Ang of his status as an undischarged bankrupt, I proceeded to consider the appropriate sentence to impose.

## The Prescribed Punishment

54     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act is a fine not exceeding $10,000, or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years, or both.

## The Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

55     The prosecution urged the court to consider imposing an imprisonment term of 10 weeks. The prosecution submitted that the Accused has not shown that there are sufficiently strong mitigating circumstances, which render the imposition of a custodial sentence inappropriate.

56     The prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors:

> a.     The amount of credit at S$100,000.00 obtained in the present case is substantial.

> b.     The loss caused by the accused is significant as there has not been any repayment of the loan and the lender would not be able to successfully submit a proof of debt to the OA’s office under the Accused’s present bankruptcy as this debt is not provable pursuant to section 87(1)(a)(i) BA.

> c.     The Accused’s action smacks of dishonesty as he took advantage of his business relationship with the lender to obtain the personal loan and it is apparent that he did not have any intention at all to settle the loan. It is further submitted that this case, as in the previous cases such as _Ong Ker Seng_ and _R Sekhar s/o R G Van_, involved some dishonesty and intent to defraud.

> d.     The Accused is not eligible for any sentencing discount as he had not pleaded guilty at the pre-trial stage but was convicted after a 7-day trial.

> e.     The prosecution further highlighted that the Accused has not shown any remorse as there has been an outright denial of the loan from the lender, Mr Ang at every stage of the proceedings, even during mitigation.

## Mitigation

57     The defence urged the court to give the Accused a chance and consider imposing a fine or a conditional discharge. His learned counsel highlighted that the Accused is 57 years old, married with 5 children, and he has no previous convictions of a similar nature. His learned counsel highlighted the financial hardship on his family due to the present proceedings, and the Covid-19 pandemic which prevented him, the main breadwinner, from returning to China to work.

58     The learned counsel highlighted in his mitigation that the Accused did not gain personally from the said loan of $100,000 and he did not receive any salary from Mr Ang from 2013 onwards. At all material times, the sole controlling party of EYF (BJ) was the lender and that the Accused had no controlling interest and/or other type of interest in EYF (BJ).

59     His learned counsel highlighted that the Accused is utterly full of regrets, in particular, working for Mr Ang, acting on his instructions, and contacting Mr Ng for the funds transfer. His learned counsel further highlighted the Accused’s strong spirit of volunteerism and contributions to his community, notwithstanding that both he and his wife, who became bankrupts when they were guarantors for his father-in-law’s business loans, were not repaid. The Accused and his wife were placed into the Green Zone because of the extent to which they had co-operated in assisting the creditors to be repaid and his wife’s bankruptcy was discharged in 2012, although the Accused remained an undischarged bankrupt.

60     Finally, his learned counsel highlighted the Accused’s medical ailments which requires him to see a medical specialist for hypertension, high blood pressure and heart damage in recent years. He and his wife look after his aged father, who also has medical ailments and heart attack risk.

## Reasons for the sentence imposed

61     In deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose, I am mindful of the sentencing principles laid down in the case of _PP v Ong Ker Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 134</span> (“_Ong Ker Seng_”), where CJ Yong Pung How held that in offences of obtaining credit without disclosure, such offences are generally “more appropriately punished with imprisonment than with a fine”. When faced with a heavy fine, it is improbable that a bankrupt would have sufficient funds to pay the fine. Hence, what is likely to follow in these cases is that either someone else would have to pay the fine on the offender’s behalf (for which the punitive effect would clearly be diluted), or alternatively, the fine would have to be derived from funds which should be available for creditors in the first place. As such, CJ Yong decided that a custodial sentence was appropriate.

62     Likewise, in _PP v Low Kok Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR 183</span>, V K Rajah JA (as he then was) imposed a one week imprisonment term for each of the s 141(1)(a) charges proceeded with, with two of the sentences ordered to run consecutively when the prosecution appealed successfully against the acquittal of the offender, who had obtained credit without disclosing that he was a bankrupt as mandated by s 141(1)(a) of the Act.

63     His Honour distinguished the previous cases such as _Ong Ker Seng_ and _PP v R Sekhar s/o R G Van_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR 456</span> (“_R Sekhar_”), which invariably involved some dishonesty and intent to defraud, in contradistinction with an unusual case, which was one of pure concealment. His Honour explained that two factors weighed heavily on his mind in deciding on the sentence: first, the fact that no loss was ultimately caused by the offender; and second, that the offender had already served a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment term for his conviction for an offence under s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act. His Honour also cautioned that the sentence was not to be regarded as the norm for contravening s 141(1)(a) of the Act.

64     From the foregoing sentencing precedents, I note that even for an unusual case such as _Low Kok Heng_, a custodial sentence was imposed as a starting point. However, I am also mindful that in the case of _Tan Beng Chua v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 1274</span> (“_Tan Beng Chua_”), the High Court observed that there is no reason why in appropriate circumstances, such as where the nature of the bankruptcy offence itself is relatively minor, and absent any aggravating features, a fine cannot be considered where a bankrupt has access to such sources of funds; and a deviation from the imposition of a custodial sentence is warranted if an offender can show that there are sufficiently strong mitigating circumstances which render the imposition of a custodial sentence inappropriate.

65     In my view, in deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose, the key question before this court is whether the bankruptcy offence committed by the Accused can be considered to be a relatively minor one, absent any aggravating features, and whether there are any strong mitigating factors, which suggest that a custodial sentence is inappropriate.

66     Having carefully considered the respective submissions of the parties, and with due respect to the learned defence counsel, I was not able to agree that the circumstances of the present case is an “extremely unusual” or a “unique” one, or that there are strong mitigating factors that would render the imposition of a custodial sentence inappropriate.

67     First, the offence that the accused has been found guilty of, cannot be considered to be a relatively minor offence. The penal provisions of the Bankruptcy Act are intended to safeguard the interests of a bankrupt’s creditors and the wider public in so far as these diverge from those of the bankrupt. Amongst other things, it is to protect the public from being misled into assuming uninformed risks in their dealings with undischarged bankrupts. In this case, the Accused clearly did not inform Mr Ang of his status as an undischarged bankrupt when he approached Mr Ang for the loan.

68     Secondly, the amount of credit at S$100,000 is not an insubstantial sum. More significantly, as highlighted by the prosecution, the sum remained unrepaid, and it is unlikely that the lender is able to successfully recover this sum. In any event, it is also trite law that the repayment of the loan by the bankrupt should not be regarded to be as strong a mitigating factor as restitution in deprivation of property cases.

69     The defence highlighted that the Accused had not gained personally from the loan of S$100,000/- and that the lender, Mr Ang, had not suffered any loss but had in fact benefited to the tune of S$20,000/- as the RMB600,000 (equivalent to S$120,000/-) transferred into EYF (BJ), was a larger sum.

70     With due respect to the learned counsel, I was not able to give much too weight to this submission given the court’s earlier finding that the S$100,000/- was a personal loan to the accused to repay Mr Ng, and that the Accused had also signed the debt acknowledgement; and also having regard to Mr Ng's evidence that he had extended a temporary loan to the Accused as a gesture of goodwill, and that he did not know Mr Ang at the material time. As rightly submitted by the prosecution, there was nothing in writing to suggest that the two transactions were in fact related.

71     Furthermore, as discussed above, even on the unusual facts of _Low Kok Heng_, where the court held that the bankrupt did not have an intent to defraud his customers in obtaining advance payments for his renovation works, but had every intention to complete the renovation works, and had indeed done so, a custodial sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment in total was eventually imposed by the High Court, with a caution that the sentence was not to be regarded as the norm for contravening s 141(1)(a) of the Act.

72     I next turn to the defence’s submission for a conditional discharge. With great respect to the learned counsel, I was not able to agree that a conditional discharge for such an offence is appropriate. The case of _Kalaiarasi d/o Marumuthu Innasimuthu v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 774</span> (“_Kalaiarasi_”) cited by the defence can easily be distinguished as that case involved a kindergarten teacher who failed to comply with her statutory requirement of filing Income and Expenditure Statements. She had incorrectly assumed that her estranged husband would submit the relevant statements on her behalf. The court was clearly of the view that there was inordinate delay occasioned by the oversight of the prosecuting authorities. In light of her gainful employment, character, lack of antecedents, as well as delay in prosecution, the court held that a conditional discharge was more appropriate than a custodial sentence, notwithstanding the serious view that the courts took towards bankruptcy offences.

73     The nature of offence in the case of _Kalaiarasi_ which was a lapse in filing the Income and Expenditure Statement, was clearly different in character from the present charge that the Accused stands convicted, and considering that the Accused is not without antecedents (albeit dissimilar antecedents), and there is also no allegation that there was an inordinate delay on the part of the prosecution, I was of the view that it would be inappropriate to grant a conditional discharge, or a fine for that matter, given the large amount of credit obtained.

74     Having determined that a fine or conditional discharge are not appropriate, I next turn to the sentencing precedents cited to consider the appropriate custodial sentence to impose.

75     First, the prosecution submitted that the case of _PP v Helme bin Abdul Hamid_ (MSC-901513-2017 to MSC-901518-2017), would be more relevant in the present case, in view of the amount of credit obtained and in view of the fact that no repayments were made. The offender accused in that case was sentenced to a total of eight (8) weeks’ imprisonment for a total sum of $66,500 and no repayment was made. The offender had pleaded guilty and had no antecedents. However, as rightly pointed out by the defence, the offender in that case faced a total of 6 charges, which in my view, can be regarded as more egregious, considering that the total amount of credit obtained was not small.

76     The prosecution also cited the case of _PP v Dennis Lim Yong Hua_ (MSC-901479-2017 & Ors) (“_Dennis Lim_”), where the offender received a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment and 14 weeks’ imprisonment for obtaining credit for a sum of about $65,000 and $84,000 respectively, which total amount of credits obtained were much higher than the present case. While the offender had pleaded guilty, no repayment was made and the offender had two similar antecedents for obtaining credit and one antecedent for unauthorised travel under s 131(1)(b) of the Act. He received a total sentence of 20 weeks’ imprisonment as additionally, he was sentenced to three (3) weeks imprisonment for each of the five proceeded charges for unauthorised travel.

77     The prosecution rightly highlighted that the case of _Dennis Lim_ would not be an appropriate consideration as that case involved a repeat offender. However, it should also be noted that the amount of credit obtained in that case, which was close to S$150,000 was a much larger sum than the present.

78     Finally, the case of _PP v Lim Eng Chun_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 53</span> (“_Lim Eng Chun_”) which involved a single charge of obtaining credit, also for a similar sum of S$100,000/-. The offender, who pleaded guilty and has no previous antecedents, was sentenced to six (6) weeks’ imprisonment at first instance. The sentence was reduced to three (3) weeks’ imprisonment by the High Court (MA 9211/2019/01) on appeal by the offender.

79     I note that the circumstances surrounding the taking of the loan in that case were quite different, and full repayment was eventually made by the wife, who had signed a personal guarantee to undertake to repay the outstanding debt owed, and the lender had taken civil action against the wife in respect of the personal guarantee. Hence, as rightly submitted by the prosecution, the sentence in _Lim Eng Chun_ should not be regarded as the norm for contravening s 141(1)(a) of the Act.

80     Nevertheless, I was of the view that this case would be most relevant and instructive, considering that it also involved a single charge of obtaining credit, and for an exact sum of S$100,000/-. More significantly, it is the most recent decision for an offence under s 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act from the High Court, which heard the appeal on 31 January 2020.

81     The other more recent case in July 2014 was _Tan Beng Chua v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 1274</span>, where the High Court stated that a short custodial term ranging from _two to four weeks_ might be considered as the starting point in sentencing an offender for providing false statements to the Official Assignee when submitting the Income and Expenditure Statement.

82     All considered, I was of the view that the custody threshold is crossed in this case, and having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case, and giving some consideration to the Accused’s personal mitigating circumstances, including his spirit of volunteerism and contributions to his community, I was of the view that a sentence of **6 weeks’ imprisonment** would be a just and appropriate sentence.

83     The Accused being dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence filed an appeal against both conviction and sentence. At the time of writing the grounds of decision, the accused is on bail pending the appeal.
