TORT – Inducement of Breach of Contract – Negligence – breach of duty

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 16/2021.\]

8 July 2021

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Introduction

1       In Magistrate Court Suit No. 4520 of 2019, the 2nd Defendant, Natius 1989 Pte Ltd (“the 2nd Defendant”) sought an indemnity against the Third-Party, Sin Hiap Miu Pte Ltd (“the Third Party”) for payments made by the 2nd Defendant to Ng Teng Fong Hospital (“the Plaintiff”) in relation to medical expenses incurred at the Plaintiff Hospital by the 1st Defendant, Kiaw Min Tun (“the 1st Defendant”) who was at the material time, an employee of the 2nd Defendant.

2       On 9 April 2021, I delivered my oral grounds and dismissed the 2nd Defendant’s claim for indemnity against the Third Party. Pursuant to an application for leave to appeal filed on 16 April 2021, I granted leave to the 2nd Defendant to appeal against my decision on 19 May 2021.

3       These are the grounds of my decision pursuant to the 2nd Defendant’s appeal against my decision in dismissing the 2nd Defendant’s claim for indemnity against the Third Party.

## Background Facts

### Parties

4       At all material times, the 1st Defendant was a construction worker from Myanmar employed by the 2nd Defendant and holding a foreign worker’s work permit. The Third Party is a company that provides tentage construction services. The 1st Defendant suffered injuries as a result of an accident and at the time of the accident, the 1st Defendant was “illegally employed” by the Third Party.

### Accident That Caused 1st Defendant to suffer injuries

5       On 12 August 2018, while the 1st Defendant was still under the employment of the 2nd Defendant, an accident happened in or around the vicinity of 30 Boon Lay Way, #01-40A, Mapletree Logistic Hub (“the premises”) where the Third Party was allegedly setting up tentages[^1] and the 1st Defendant suffered injuries as a result of the accident. As a result of the said accident, the 1st Defendant incurred medical expenses for his medical treatment at the Plaintiff Hospital. On 13 September 2019, the Plaintiff obtained an Order of Court for the sum of $39,905.24 as medical expenses and $3,500 as costs against the 2nd Defendant.

## Parties’ Cases

6       The 2nd Defendant’s case against the Third Party is that the 1st Defendant’s injuries were sustained while he was allegedly erecting a tentage at the Third Party’s premises. The 2nd Defendant further alleged that the 1st Defendant was illegally employed by the Third Party and that the injuries were sustained while he was illegally employed by the Third-Party.

7       The 2nd Defendant’s claim of indemnity and damages against the Third Party is premised on the following:

> (a)     That the Third Party is liable for the losses and damages suffered by the 2nd Defendant as it has wrongfully induced the 1st Defendant to breach his employment contract with the 2nd Defendant by its illegal employment of the 1st Defendant without the 2nd Defendant’s consent and/or knowledge. For this head of claim, the 2nd Defendant further says that it is entitled to rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur by virtue of an alleged verbal agreement on 14 August 2018 whereby the Third Party’s director, Ronnie Oh (“Oh”) had agreed to be a guarantor for the medical bills incurred by the 1st Defendant[^2].

> (b)     The Third Party owes a duty of care to the 2nd Defendant and the Third Party has breached this duty of care; thereby rendering the Third Party liable for the losses and damages of the 2nd Defendant arising therefrom[^3].

8       In their Defence, the Third Party denied that it was liable to indemnify the 2nd Defendant. The Third Party also denied knowledge of the relationship between the 2nd Defendant and the 1st Defendant prior to the accident. The Third Party further avers that the 1st Defendant’s injuries were caused by him falling into a drain while he was visiting his friend at the premises. The Third Party further denied that there was any verbal agreement between the Third Party and the 2nd Defendant whereby the Third Party had agreed to pay for the 1st Defendant’s medical expenses or had admitted to any liability.

## Parties’ Evidence

### 2nd Defendant’s Evidence

9       The 2nd Defendant adduced the following evidence in support of its case:

> (a)     The evidence through Ministry of Manpower’s (“MOM’s”) Notice dated 4 October 2018 and MOM’s letter dated 2 November 2020 to show that the Third Party had illegally employed the 1st Defendant on 12 August 2018.

> (b)     The evidence through the Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”) of Foo Jee Chin (“Foo”), the 2nd Defendant’s secretary and administrative assistant which, in summary, testifies as follows:

>> (i)       The day of the accident, 12 August 2018 was a Sunday which was a non-working day for the 1st Defendant[^4].

>> (ii)       In the late morning or early afternoon of 13 August 2018, one day after the accident, Foo received a phone call from the 2nd Defendant’s then site supervisor, Chuah Kim Swee (“Chuah”) who informed her that he had received a phone call on 12 August 2018 at about 2.00pm from one Aung Mint Tun (“Aung”), another employee of the 2nd Defendant and friend of the 1st Defendant, who told him about the accident[^5].

>> (iii)       Chuah subsequently informed Foo to contact the Third Party’s director, Mr Ronnie Oh (“Oh”) to find out more about the accident[^6].

>> (iv)       On 14 August 2018, Foo contacted Oh. Later that afternoon, at 3:30pm, Foo met Oh in the vicinity of the 2nd Defendant’s premises. Chuah and another site supervisor of the 2nd Defendant, Nasim also attended this meeting. At this meeting, Foo was informed by Oh that in the accident, the 1st Defendant had fallen into a drain at or in the vicinity of the Third Party’s warehouse and that it was Oh who drove the 1st Defendant to the hospital[^7].

>> (v)       Foo testified that to her surprise, without any prompting on her part, Oh told her he would be a guarantor for the 1st Defendant’s medical bills[^8]. Foo testified that Oh explained to her that the Third Party’s foreman had asked him to pay for the 1st Defendant’s medical bills as the 1st Defendant and the Third Party’s foreman are friends[^9]. According to Foo, Oh also told her not to report the accident to MOM[^10].

>> (vi)       On 15 August 2018, Foo received a message from one Ms Liew, a representative of the Third Party informing her that the hospital would be calling her for a final discussion about the medical charges[^11]. On the same evening, Foo received an email signed off by one Yeong FK (“Yeong”) attaching an unsigned agreement[^12]. The said unsigned agreement stated that Oh “_agrees with (the 2nd Defendant) to pay the medical cost of the injury worker Mr Kyaw Min Tun (Fin No. XXX, WP No. XXX) according to valid official receipt from the Hospital_.” The unsigned agreement further states that the 2nd Defendant will pay the full medical cost upfront and Oh will pay back by instalments[^13].

### Third Party’s Evidence

10     The Third Party’s evidence is adduced through Oh. A summary of Oh’s evidence is as follows:

> (a)     On 12 August 2018, while he was at the premises to oversee the setting up of tentages, he received a phone call from the Third Party’s foreman informing him that the 1st Defendant had fallen into a drain and got injured. Oh testified that he was informed that the 1st Defendant was not an employee of the Third Party and that the 1st Defendant had visited the said foreman at the premises[^14].

> (b)     Oh testified that he drove the 1st Defendant to the hospital out of the kindness of his heart[^15] but that that there is no relationship between the Third Party and the 1st Defendant[^16].

> (c)     On 13 August 2018, Oh was contacted by Chuah who identified himself as the representative of the 2nd Defendant and was requested to meet up with the 2nd Defendant’s representatives as the 1st Defendant was an employee of the 2nd Defendant.

> (d)     On 14 August 2018, Oh met the 2nd Defendant’s representatives and employees Foo, Chuah and Nasim. Oh testified that as he was concerned that no one would pay the 1st Defendant’s hospital fees, he expressed an intention to foot the 1st Defendant’s medical bills and the 2nd Defendant was agreeable to his proposal.

> (e)     Pursuant to the meeting on 14 August 2018, on 15 August 2018, Oh asked his staff to send an email containing the unsigned agreement.[^17]

> (f)     Oh testified that after 15 August 2018, it dawned on him that the 2nd Defendant would be able to claim reimbursement for the medical bills from insurance and he sought legal advice from his counsel[^18]. Pursuant to such advice, his counsel sent a letter to the 2nd Defendant stating that the Third Party did not intend to make any payment, pending the outcome of the Notice of Assessment by MOM[^19].

## Issues for Determination

11     Arising from the pleaded case and positions of the parties, the following issues are for my determination:

> (a)     Whether the Third Party is liable to the 2nd Defendant for losses suffered as a result of inducing the 1st Defendant’s breach of his employment contract with the 2nd Defendant. The following issues are related to this issue of liability for inducement of breach of contract:

>> (i)       Whether the Third Party has induced the 1st Defendant’s breach of contract with the 2nd Defendant;

>> (ii)       Whether the 2nd Defendant’s losses are occasioned by reason of such inducement of breach of contract by the Third Party; and

>> (iii)       Whether there was a verbal agreement by the Third Party to bear the medical expenses and if so, whether the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, rendering the Third Party liable.

> (b)     Whether the Third Party owes a duty of care to the 2nd Defendant in relation to the 1st Defendant and whether the Third Party has beached that duty of care owed to the 2nd Defendant.

### Whether the Third Party is liable to the 2nd Defendant for losses suffered as a result of inducing the 1st Defendant’s breach of his employment contract with the 2nd Defendant

#### The Law

12     To establish the tort of inducement of breach of contract, the burden is on the 2nd Defendant to prove the following elements (see _Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 655</span> at \[311\])**:**

> (a)     That the Third Party had knowledge of the existence of the 1st Defendant’s employment contract with the 2nd Defendant.

> (b)     That the Third Party had intended to interfere with the contractual rights of the 2nd Defendant.

> (c)     That the Third Party had directly procured or induced the breach of the employment contract by the 1st Defendant.

> (d)     That the 2nd Defendant has suffered losses as a result of the 1st Defendant’s breach of his employment contract with the 2nd Defendant.

13     There are two distinct aspects to the mental element of the tort of inducement of breach of contract – the first is the Third Party’s knowledge of the existence of the contract and the second is that the Third Party had intended the breach of contract by the 1st Defendant.

14     On the first mental element, the test is an objective one. It is not necessary to show that the Third Party has actual knowledge of the contract. The Third Party is deemed to know if the existence of the contract is obvious or may reasonably be inferred from the surrounding circumstances.[^20]

15     As for the second element, the requisite intention is only satisfied if the “inducer” (here, the inducer is the Third Party) has intended the breach of contract as an end in itself, or as a means to a desired end.[^21] In _Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 407</span>, it was observed that the inducer must have intended to interfere with the contract and that it is not sufficient that the resulting breach of contract was a mere natural consequence of the inducer’s conduct (see \[17\]). Nevertheless, while the knowledge of a probable or certain outcome is not to be equated with an intention to cause that outcome, the requisite intention may be inferred from such knowledge. This is especially so where the inducer knows that the resulting breach is an effective means of achieving the outcome that he desires.[^22]

#### Findings of Fact

##### (1)   Whether the Third Party has induced the 1st Defendant’s breach of contract with the 2nd Defendant

(A)   Did the Third Party know of the existence of the contract alleged to be breached, i.e., the employment contract between the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant?

16     In this case, the 2nd Defendant’s allegation that the 1st Defendant’s injuries were suffered while he was illegally employed by the Third Party and was carrying out tentage work when the accident happened is primarily based on the evidence of the Ministry of Manpower’s (“MOM’s”) Notice dated 4 October 2018[^23] and the MOM’s letter dated 2 November 2020[^24]. MOM’s Notice dated 4 October 2018 is addressed to the Third Party and it states, “_We have completed our investigations and found that you have committed the offence (s) listed overleaf_” and in the overleaf, it was stated – “_S5(1) Illegal Employment_”. In the said notice, the Third Party was required to pay a composition fine of $1000 by 18 October 2018 for the offence stated therein.

17     As for MOM’s letter dated 2 November 2020, it identified the following information:

> (a)     The 1st Defendant was the employee in relation to the offence of illegal employment committed by the Third Party.

> (b)     The date of commission of the offence of illegal employment was stated to be 12 August 2018.

> (c)     The location of the offence of illegal employment committed by the Third Party was stated to be “170 West Coast Road”.

18     The said MOM’s Notice and letter showed that the Third Party had committed the offence of illegal employment in relation to the 1st Defendant on 12 August 2018. Based on this, there is sufficient evidence to show that the Third Party had illegally employed the 1st Defendant on 12 August 2018.

19     On the facts of this case, given that the 1st Defendant was a foreign worker holding a work permit, it would be obvious to the Third Party that the 1st Defendant must have an existing contract of employment with another entity for which he was issued with the requisite work permit. Therefore, I had no difficulty arriving at the finding that the Third Party must have known of the existence of an employment contract.

(B)   Did the Third Party intend to interfere with the contractual rights of the 2nd Defendant?

20     Based on MOM’s Notice of 4 October 2018 and MOM’s letter dated 2 November 2020 showing the fact of commission of the offence of illegal employment of the 1st Defendant by the Third Party and based on the fact that the work permit would show information regarding the employer of the 1st Defendant, I also had no difficulty in finding that the Third Party would have known that the outcome of the 1st Defendant’s employment by the Third Party would result in the 1st Defendant being in breach of his employment contract with the 2nd Defendant. Arising from this, I found that the Third Party, by illegally hiring the 1st Defendant, must have intended the breach of contract by the 1st Defendant. Accordingly, I was satisfied that the second element which requires that the Third Party be shown to have the requisite intention to interfere with the contractual rights of the 2nd Defendant was also made out.

(C)   Has the Third Party directly procured or induced the breach of contract by the 1st Defendant?

21     Nevertheless, as regards the third ingredient, I found the evidence to be insufficient for me to make a finding that the Third Party had directly procured or induced the breach of contract by the 1st Defendant. This is because the 2nd Defendant had not adduced any evidence whatsoever to show the circumstances under which or how the 1st Defendant came to be “employed” by the Third Party.

22     The 2nd Defendant did not conduct any investigations into the circumstances under which the 1st Defendant came to be “employed” by the Third Party. Had the 2nd Defendant done so, it would not have been difficult to obtain evidence from the 1st Defendant himself given that the 2nd Defendant was the contractual employer and had access to the 1st Defendant after the accident. The 2nd Defendant also did not call the Third Party’s foreman or any of its employee as its witness to testify as to the circumstances under which the 1st Defendant came to be employed by the Third Party.

23     In the absence of any evidence surrounding the circumstances under which the 1st Defendant came to be “employed” by the Third Party, and in the absence of any evidence showing the involvement of the Third Party in procuring the employment of the 1st Defendant, it is unclear as to whether this was a case whereby the Third Party had directly procured or induced the breach of contract by the 1st Defendant. I therefore found that the third element required for a case of inducement of breach of contract to be made out is not met.

24     Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence tendered, on the issue of whether the Third Party is liable for inducing the 1st Defendant’s breach of contract, I am not satisfied that the 2nd Defendant has proven on a balance of probabilities that the Third Party has induced the 1st Defendant to breach his employment contract with the 2nd Defendant.

##### (2)   Whether the 2nd Defendant’s losses are occasioned by reason of such inducement of breach of contract by the Third Party

25     Regardless of whether the 2nd Defendant has established that the Third Party has induced the breach by the 1st Defendant, most importantly, I found that the 2nd Defendant had failed to establish that the losses it has suffered is the result of the Third Party’s inducement of breach of contract (this is also the fourth ingredient to found liability for inducement of breach of contract).

26     In the instant case, the 2nd Defendant had not led any evidence to show that the 1st Defendant’s injuries for which the 2nd Defendant suffered losses (in that the 2nd Defendant had to bear the medical treatment charges incurred by the 1st Defendant) was caused by the Third Party’s inducement of breach of employment contract by the 1st Defendant. The Third Party’s case is that the 1st Defendant’s injuries came from a fall into a drain in the vicinity of the premises[^25]. Foo’s testimony does not contradict this as she has testified that Oh had told her at her meeting with Oh that the 1st Defendant had fallen into a drain while visiting the Third Party’s foreman who was his friend[^26].

27     Other than the MOM’s Notice and Letter, the only other evidence adduced by the 2nd Defendant in support of their claim under the tort of inducement of breach of contract is the evidence of Foo Jee Chin ("Foo"), the 2nd Defendant's only witness in this matter. In her Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) affirmed on 17 August 2020, Foo admitted that she had no personal knowledge of where, how or when the 1st Defendant came to sustain his injuries[^27].

28     In cross-examination, Foo conceded that the 2nd Defendant had not adduced any evidence to show the cause of the injuries suffered by the 1st Defendant. It is also not disputed that the 1st Defendant was sent back to his home country notwithstanding that he would be a key witness to substantiate the 2nd Defendant’s claim against the Third Party.

> Q    Yes. So, would be right to say that this is the first time that you---you were told by the---by the worker that on---number 1, “I had been \[inaudible\] due to tentage structure materials falling on---onto me.

> A    It is what he said, yah.

> Q    Yes. Prior to this, you had no knowledge of---

> A    No.

> Q    what happened to him?

> A    No, no.

> Q    Right. But the worker of course is not here today, 1st Defendant, he’s been sent back.

> A    Yah.

> Q    Right? Why do you send him back when the case is still pending?

> A    She \[sic\] wants to go back in ch---ch---to his medical treatment because over here it’s too expensive---

> Q    Yes.

> A    yah.

> Q    But you have a case against the Third---Third party.

> A    At that time there’s no case---

> Q    Okay.

> A    at all yet. Yah.

> Q    But would you want to retain him to---to come and give evidence? I mean---

> A    You---

> Q    in---in---in a event there’s a---

> A    I---I, sorry---uh, I’m not the boss here. So, anyway he say he want to go back, my boss says, okay.

> Q    Yes.

> A    Then we let him go.[^28]

29     Although Foo’s evidence is that she was informed about the accident by Chuah who was then the 2nd Defendant’s site supervisor[^29], no evidence was obtained from Chuah as to his knowledge about the accident. Chuah received information from Aung and so, in addition to Chuah, Aung would also be an important witness as he would have received information directly from the 1st Defendant himself. The 2nd Defendant had chosen not to call either Chuah or Aung as its witness. As neither Chuah nor Aung who informed Chuah about the accident was called as a witness, the contents of the phone conversation that Chuah had with Foo is but hearsay evidence that is inadmissible. At the very best, even if it is not inadmissible, great caution should be exercised before according due weight to it.

30     At the meeting that Foo had with Oh on 14 August 2018, other than Chuah, there was another employee by the name of Nasim in attendance. The 2nd Defendant had also chosen not to call Nasim to give evidence in court.

31     It is not disputed that neither Foo nor any employee under the employment of the 2nd Defendant interviewed or recorded any statement from the 1st Defendant. Therefore, there is no evidence of any investigation into what happened that led to the injuries sustained by the 1st Defendant.

32     Foo’s testimony that the “_1st Defendant had admitted the circumstances leading to the accident on 12 August 2018_” is based on what she was told by one Manik, who is a friend of the 1st Defendant. As the 2nd Defendant had not called this Manik as a witness, what Foo heard from this Manik is hearsay evidence which is inadmissible. Furthermore, Foo herself has not testified on what these “_circumstances leading to the accident on 12 August 2018_” were.

33     Therefore, the 2nd Defendant has not adduced any evidence to show that the injuries suffered by the 1st Defendant are related to the Third Party’s alleged inducement of breach of contract, i.e., that the injuries were suffered while the 1st Defendant was carrying out work for the Third Party.

34     In contrast, the Third Party’s witness, Oh testified that he received a phone call from one of Third Party’s workers who informed him that the 1st Defendant who was visiting this worker fell into a drain and got injured[^30]. Oh testified that he went to the location of the accident and drove the 1st Defendant to the Plaintiff Hospital to seek treatment[^31].

35     I did not consider the 2nd Defendant’s evidence of the injuries sustained by the 1st Defendant adduced via the 1st Defendant’s Hospital Inpatient Discharge Summary[^32] to be sufficient to make any inference therefrom as the 2nd Defendant has not called any expert witness to testify as to the injuries of the 1st Defendant as well as to support the 2nd Defendant’s bare assertion that the injuries were severe and could not have been caused by a fall into a drain. Therefore, against Oh’s testimony on the information he received concerning how the 1st Defendant came to sustain the injuries, the 2nd Defendant has not adduced any cogent evidence to contradict it.

36     It was not disputed that there were no investigations into the factual circumstances surrounding the accident carried out by MOM because the 1st Defendant did not file any claim for workplace injury compensation[^33].

37     Therefore, based on the available evidence adduced by the 2nd Defendant, aside from the fact that the Third Party had paid a composition fine for the “illegal employment” of the 1st Defendant, there is nothing to show how the accident happened and more importantly, that the accident happened while the 1st Defendant was carrying out work or duties while being under his employment with the Third Party.

38     On the whole, based on the evidence adduced, I am not satisfied that the 2nd Defendant has shown that the 1st Defendant’s injuries were sustained while he was erecting a tentage in the course of working for the Third Party. Accordingly, the 2nd Defendant’s case against the Third Party that is based primarily on its bare and unsubstantiated allegation that the 1st Defendant’s injuries arose out of an accident that happened while he was erecting tentages in the course of his illegal employment by the Third Party must necessarily fail.

> \-    Whether there was a verbal agreement by the Third Party to bear the medical expenses of the 1st Defendant and whether the evidence of such verbal agreement invokes the rule of res ipsa loquitur

39     The 2nd Defendant alleged that at the meeting between the 2nd Defendant’s Foo and the Third Party’s Oh on 14 August 2018, the Third Party’s Oh had verbally agreed to be the guarantor for the medical expenses of the 1st Defendant. Oh himself did not dispute that he had expressed his intention to foot the bills at the meeting on 14 August 2018 and that the unsigned agreement was sent to Foo under his instructions[^34].

40     However, a closer examination of Foo’s testimony shows that Foo herself has testified that at that said meeting on 14 August 2018, Oh had explained to her that his foreman had asked him to pay for the 1st Defendant’s medical bills[^35]. This aspect of Foo’s testimony does not contradict Oh’s explanation as to why he had initially agreed to act as the “guarantor” for the 1st Defendant’s medical expenses which is that he did so because he was concerned that no one would pay the 1st Defendant’s hospital fees[^36].

41     I therefore did not find that Oh’s verbal agreement to act as the “guarantor” or to pay for 1st Defendant’s medical expenses is probative of the 2nd Defendant’s case that the 1st Defendant’s injuries were sustained as a result of carrying out work in the course of his employment with the Third Party. In the circumstances, I am of the view that there is no place for the maxim res ipsa loquitur to apply to shift the legal burden of proof to the Third Party.

42     The overall burden of proof falls on the 2nd Defendant to show, on a balance of probabilities that the Third Party has committed the tort of inducement of breach of contract.

43     Based on the totality of the evidence heard and submitted by the 2nd Defendant, I concluded that the 2nd Defendant had failed to show that the Third Party had directly procured or induced the breach of contract by the 1st Defendant and that the 2nd Defendant had suffered losses as a result of such inducement of breach of contract.

### Whether the Third Party owes a duty of care to the 2nd Defendant and has beached that duty of care owed

44     On the issue of whether the Third Party owes a duty of care to the 2nd Defendant in relation to the 1st Defendant, I had found that the 2nd Defendant had not pleaded any material facts that form the basis for establishing that the Third Party owes a duty of care to the 2nd Defendant in relation to the 1st Defendant. In the 2nd Defendant’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No.1), the Third Party’s breach of a duty of care owed to the 2nd Defendant was pleaded as an alternative head of claim as follows:

>     Alternatively, the 2nd Defendant avers that the Third Party owed a duty of care to the 2nd Defendant, and the Third Party had breached the aforesaid duty of care. As a result, the 2nd Defendant has suffered losses and damage.[^37]

45     Other than this bare averment that there has been a breach of duty of care owed to the 2nd Defendant, the 2nd Defendant has not pleaded any particulars in support of the cause of action in negligence against the Third Party. I am of the view that the pleaded case of the 2nd Defendant had been one that is focussed on the tort of inducement of breach of contract rather than one based on a breach of a duty of care owed by the Third Party to the 2nd Defendant. For these reasons, I also found the 2nd Defendant has not established its case that the Third Party has breached its duty of care owed to the 2nd Defendant.

46     In the 2nd Defendant’s application for leave to appeal, counsel for the 2nd Defendant has argued that the question of whether a party who has illegally employed a foreign worker owes a duty of care to the contractual employer in relation to the said worker is a question of general principle that is being decided for the first time and is a question of general importance whereby a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage as one of the reasons for leave to be granted. I agreed with counsel for the 2nd Defendant that this is a question of law that is of general principle and that it would be to the public advantage for a pronouncement to be made by a higher judicial authority. I therefore granted leave to the 2nd Defendant to appeal against my decision.

47     Nevertheless, on this alternative claim under the tort of negligence, the question of whether the 2nd Defendant has shown on a balance of probabilities that the Third Party has breached its duty of care owed to the 2nd Defendant in relation to the 1st Defendant and the question of whether the evidence shows that it is more likely than not that the Third Party’s negligence had caused the 1st Defendant’s injuries are still the material questions. Based on my finding that the 2nd Defendant has not shown that the 1st Defendant’s injuries were sustained while he was erecting tentages in the course of his employment with the Third Party, the 2nd Defendant’s case against the Third Party would still fail on those questions.

## Conclusion

48     Based on the foregoing, I dismissed the 2nd Defendant’s claim for indemnity and/or damages against the Third Party, with costs to the Third Party. After hearing submissions on cost from their counsel, I fixed costs at $7500 plus reasonable disbursements plus GST as applicable.
