Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Outrage of modesty

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9028/2022/01.\]

18 March 2022

### District Judge Lynette Yap:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Yong Chun Hong, a 32 year-old male Singaporean, pleaded guilty to a charge of outrage of modesty under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with section 34 of the Penal Code for acting in furtherance of the common intention with 2 other persons, Yap Chun Chieh (“Yap”) and Tay Boon Huat (“Tay”).

2       The details of the charge are as follows:

> DAC 909603 of 2021

> You, Yong Chun Hong, are charged that you, on 17 September 2018, sometime between 7 am and 7.25 am, in Singapore, inside a motor vehicle bearing registration number SLJ5865T, together with Yap Chun Chieh and Tay Boon Huat, and in furtherance of the common intention of the three of you, did use criminal force to \[the victim\], intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, by squeezing \[the victim’s\] breast over her clothes, and you have hereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

3       Following the Accused’s conviction on the above molest charge, he consented for a separate charge of doing an act that has a tendency to obstruct the course of justice under section 204A of the Penal Code to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing.

4       I sentenced the Accused to eight months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane. The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed. The sentence of imprisonment has been stayed and the Accused is on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

## Facts

5       At the material time, the Accused was working as a manager/bouncer at Club V5 Tycoon (“Club V5”), located at 21 Cuscaden Road, Ming Arcade. On 16 September 2018, the Accused, Tay and five other persons working at Club V5 were staying in a chalet room at D’Resort@Downtown East booked by Tay.

6       The portions of the Statement of Facts which are pertinent to the commission of the offences by the Accused are reproduced below:

> 5.    Sometime after midnight on 17 September 2018, the Accused, Tay, Yeo and Gan travelled to Club V5 in Yeo’s car. The Accused and Gan then went to work, while Yeo and Tay drank while waiting for the Accused and Gan to finish work.

> 6.    At about 3.35 am, the victim arrived at Club V5 with some of her friends, after having consumed alcohol at another nightclub before that. Upon arrival at Club V5, the victim proceeded to consume more alcohol. At about 5.20 am, the victim and her friends went to the first floor of Ming Arcade, where her friends entered into a drunken dispute outside Club V5 with another group of clubgoers (which included Tay). After the dispute was resolved, the victim’s friends left the area, leaving her behind. In her intoxicated state, the victim returned to Club V5 with the Accused, Yeo and Tay and continued consuming alcohol with them.

> 7.    At about 6 am, the Accused brought the victim (who was unable to walk on her own) to the female toilet, followed by the male toilet on level 4 of the Ming Arcade, where he spent about 15 minutes alone with her behind closed doors.

> 8.    Subsequently, at about 6.35 am, the Accused brought the victim down to the first floor of Ming Arcade and passed her over to Yap, telling him to send her home by taxi. At this point, the victim was severely intoxicated, and had trouble walking on her own. Yap then walked with the victim to the taxi stand located at Forum the Shopping Mall, and enlisted the help of a friend to book a Grab ride for the victim as he did not have the application installed in his phone.

> 9.    At around 7 am, after Club V5 had closed, the Accused, Gan and Tay decided to return to the chalet and boarded Yeo’s car. The Accused told them that Yap and the victim were at the abovementioned taxi stand and Yeo therefore drove his car towards the said taxi stand where they spotted Yap with the victim. Yeo stopped the car, and the Accused persuaded Yap to join them at the chalet. At this point, the Accused alighted from Yeo’s car and pulled the heavily intoxicated victim by her arm into the car. The six of them then proceeded to the chalet in Yeo’s car.

> 10.In the car, Yeo drove while Tay was the front passenger. In the rear, Yap sat in the middle while hugging the victim on his lap, while the Accused and Gan sat on Yap’s left and right respectively. The victim was unconscious throughout the journey.

> 11.    While travelling to the chalet, Tay stretched his hand to the back and pulled down the victim’s top before touching her breasts. Yap joined in and touched the victim’s breasts with his hands while hugging her. Following that, the Accused also reached over and squeezed the victim’s breast once over her bra.

## The Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

7       The Prosecution referred to the sentencing framework set out in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”).

8       At the first stage, the court should consider the offence-specific factors to identify the sentencing band and then determine where the offence falls within that range, to derive an indicative starting point which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the offending act.

9       The characteristics of each band are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.9774045190962%"> <col width="61.1077784443111%"> <col width="25.9148170365927%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Bands</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band 1</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 5 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band 2</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This includes cases where two or more of the offence-specific factors present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">5 to 15 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band 3</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This includes cases where numerous offence-specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

10     At the second stage, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender.

11     Applying the _Kunasekaran_ sentencing framework to the present case, the Prosecution submitted that the offence fell within the mid to high end of Band 2 with an indicative starting custodial sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment due to the presence of the following offence-specific aggravating factors:

> (a)     There was an intrusion into the victim’s private parts in that the accused squeezed the victim’s breast;

> (b)     The offence was committed on an extremely vulnerable victim who was severely intoxicated and unable to fend for herself;

> (c)     This was a group sexual assault where the Accused, Tay and Yap molested the victim one after another.

12     Applying the second stage of the said framework, the Prosecution considered the plea of guilt by the Accused and his cooperation with the authorities and calibrated the indicative starting sentence downwards. The Prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence for the offence should be at least nine months’ imprisonment.

13     The Prosecution further submitted that given that the Accused had intruded upon the victim’s private parts, the Accused should be sentenced to at least three strokes of the cane.

## Mitigation

14     The Defence did not dispute that the offence fell within Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework[^1], but contended that the relevant starting point in the present case should be no more than 9 months’ imprisonment with a further downward adjustment, bringing the appropriate custodial sentence to no more than 5 to 6 months’ imprisonment.

15     The Defence submitted that the Accused had made a timeous plea of guilt and this was a reflection of his genuine remorse. The Accused had also cooperated with the police and he had no relevant antecedents. The Defence also submitted that there was no premeditation on the Accused’s part and the offence was due to a momentary lapse in judgment and committed in the spur of the moment[^2]. The Defence highlighted that the Accused had not outraged the modesty of the victim for a prolonged period and there was no skin-to-skin contact with the victim[^3]. The Defence further highlighted that the Accused had not molested a young victim or committed the offence brazenly in a public place[^4].

16     The Defence submitted that caning should not be imposed as there were no aggravating factors such as skin-to-skin contact, prolonged contact or restraint to the victim.

## The court’s decision on sentence

17     It was not in dispute that this was a Band 2 case within the _Kunasekaran_ framework.

18     With regards to the offence-specific factors, I considered that the degree of sexual exploitation was moderate to high. There was no skin-to-skin contact with the victim. However, there was a clear intrusion upon the victim’s private parts as the Accused squeezed the victim’s breast over her bra after her top had been pulled down by Tay. Furthermore, the Accused was part of a group assault with Tay and Yap and acting in furtherance of the common intention to outrage her modesty. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that a group sexual offence was an offence-specific factor that went towards the aggravation of the offence[^5].

19     I also considered the circumstances of the offence. The Accused had exploited the vulnerability of the heavily intoxicated victim who was unable to fend for herself. Whilst no violence or aggression was used in the commission of the offence, the Accused had alighted from Yeo’s car and pulled the heavily intoxicated victim from the taxi stand by her arm into the car.

20     Based on the above offence-specific factors, I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that the appropriate starting point was within the mid to high end of Band 2 and I adopted an indicative starting custodial sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment which was just above the mid-point of Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework.

21     I then considered if there were any offender-specific factors that warranted further calibration of the indicative sentence. The fact that the Accused had no relevant antecedents is merely the absence of an aggravating factor. The absence of an aggravating factor cannot _ipso facto_ constitute a mitigating factor[^6].

22     The Accused did plead guilty, and cooperated with the authorities, which is a valid mitigating factor. The Accused also consented to a charge under section 204A of the Penal Code to be taken into consideration for sentencing. In view of his plea of guilt, while acknowledging the charge taken into consideration, I calibrated the indicative starting sentence downwards and arrived at the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment.

23     I further imposed 2 strokes of the cane as it has been held in _Public Prosecutor v Chow Yee Sze_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 481</span> (“_Chow Yee Sze_”) at \[9\]; cited with approval in _GBR v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> at \[31\] and _Kunasekaran_ at \[50\], that caning ought to be imposed where a victim’s private parts or sexual organs are intruded upon.

24     In the case of _Kunasekaran_, the offender was convicted after trial for touching a 14 year-old victim’s groin area over her school uniform on a public bus. At first instance, the offender was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment and no additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning was imposed although he was above the age of 50. Despite finding that the offender had intruded into the victim’s groin area and not her vagina, the High Court upheld the sentence on appeal.

25     With regards to the Defence’s reliance on _Kunasekaran_ to argue against the imposition of caning, it is clear that the issue of caning in _Kunasekaran_ was considered in the limited context of whether the court should exercise its discretion to impose a term of imprisonment in lieu of caning as the offender, who was above 50 years of age, was statutorily ineligible for caning. The High Court’s decision was not that caning was inappropriate on the facts of the case, but that the “sentencing considerations that displace the starting position that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced just because he is exempted from caning are not present”[^7]. Therefore, the High Court’s decision not to impose imprisonment in lieu of caning in _Kunasekaran_ does not assist the Accused.

26     In the case of _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span> (“GCO”), the offender pleaded guilty to molesting the victim by touching her vagina area beneath her shorts but over her underwear while she was asleep. On appeal, the High Court found that there was a high degree of sexual exploitation as there was an intrusion into the victim’s private parts whilst she was asleep and vulnerable and upheld the sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment, while setting aside the first instance sentence of caning. The High Court observed at \[94\]:

> In my view, caning ought not to be imposed in this case. Caning has typically been imposed on offenders in cases applying the _Kunasekaran_ framework where there was skin-to-skin contact, or the contact was prolonged, or there was an **element of restraint** applied to the victim, although **these aggravating factors should not be taken to be exhaustive**. None of these three factors is present here…

> (emphasis added)

27     I did not accept the Defence’s contention that _GCO_ stood for the proposition that caning should only be imposed where there were aggravating factors such as skin-to-skin contact, prolonged contact or restraint to the victim. The High Court expressly stated that these aggravating factors should not be taken to be exhaustive. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that there was an element of restraint as the victim was confined in the rear enclosed space of a moving car, hugged by Yap on his lap who was seated in the middle, and flanked by the Accused and another passenger, while the Accused acted in furtherance of his common intention with Yap and Tay to molest the victim.

28     With regards to the Defence’s reliance on the case of _Chow Yee Sze_, where the offender was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment with no caning, I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that this case preceded _Kunasekaran_ and the High Court in _Kunasekaran_ had at \[51\] stated that “the benchmark approach adopted in _Chow Yee Sze_ may thus not suitably provide for clear, transparent, coherent and consistent sentencing”. It is clear that cases involving an offence of outrage of modesty present with great variance and different offence-specific factors. What the court has to do is to apply the _Kunasekaran_ framework to the unique facts of the case, as stated by Menon CJ in _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 1412</span> at \[87\]:

> The more principled methodology for arriving at the appropriate sentence…is to apply the _Kunasekaran_ framework, and consider where the present case falls.

## Conclusion

29     I was of the view that a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment with two strokes of the cane was appropriate and commensurate with the culpability of the Accused and the harm caused.

30     The Accused was in remand from the time he was arrested on 26 September 2018 to the time he was released on bail on 5 October 2018. He was then remanded again on 23 August 2019 when bail was revoked and subsequently released on bail on 10 December 2019. The Defence submitted that the time spent by the Accused in remand should be taken into account. The Prosecution did not object to this. In the circumstances, I backdated his sentence to 26 September 2018 to take into account the time spent in remand by the Accused, excluding any period of time the Accused was released on bail.
