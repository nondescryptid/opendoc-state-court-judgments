Contract – Breach

Contract – Discharge

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 31/2021.\]

29 October 2021

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The plaintiff, Double S Construction Pte Ltd (“DS”) is a Singapore registered company in the business of providing civil construction services.

2       The defendant, LBE Engineering Pte Ltd (“LBE”) is a Singapore registered company, and are also in the business of providing civil construction services.

3       LBE had requested DS to quote, as sub-contractors, for a project referred to in the Statement of Claim (“SOC”) as the “Jalan Besar Town Council project” (the “Project”).

4       DS submitted their quotation for the Project in the sum of $391,273.48.

5       There were then negotiations between DS and LBE. The original scope of works that DS would carry out as sub-contractors for the Project was reduced from seven locations to three.

6       The contract sum was consequently reduced from the original sum of $391,273.48 to the revised sum of $243,811.

7       LBE issued their Letter of Award (“LOA”) dated 18 December 2017 to DS in respect of the agreed contractual relationship between the parties for the Project.

8       In \[7\] of the SOC, DS pleaded that LBE had paid three of the invoices issued by DS. DS further pleaded in \[7\] of the SOF, that the “payment mode was upon (DS) submitting their Progress Claims, (LBE) will inspect the work and issue their certificates. This will be followed with (DS) submitting their invoices and (LBE) making the payments thereupon”. It is pertinent to note at this stage, that \[7\] of the SOF is not denied by LBE in their Defence and Counterclaim (“DCC”).

9       DS had started work on 23 December 2017 and had submitted their progress claims for the months of April and May on 26 May 2018. According to DS, it was against a background of delayed certification and payment by LBE for previous submissions that finally, DS notified LBE on 12 June 2018, that they (DS) intended to stop work within seven days if outstanding payments were not received. As it transpired, DS did not receive payment, and stopped work on 18 June 2018.

10     The main issue at trial was whether DS were entitled to hold LBE in breach, and thereafter halt all work.

11     I held that DS were so entitled. In the SOC, DS had pleaded that they were entitled to the total sum, based on their unpaid progress claims for the three locations in the Project, of $90,845.35, Interest and Costs.

12     After considering the evidence heard at trial and the further submissions on the issue of quantum due to DS, I held that DS had proven its case against LBE on a balance of probabilities and were entitled to the quantum as pleaded. Thus, Judgment was entered in favour of DS in the sum of $90,845.35, Interest thereon at 5.33% from date of Writ to date of Judgment, and Costs to be agreed or taxed. The Counterclaim mounted by LBE was dismissed. LBE appealed.

13     As stated in \[8\] above, LBE did not, in its pleadings, deny how DS had characterised the payment clause was to operate. We shall return to this point later.

14     In its pleadings, LBE had claimed that it was DS which had delayed its work and had performed its work “shoddily”. LBE averred that it had “no other alternative but to terminate (DS’) work in June 2018. I found against LBE on this. Having considered the evidence, I found that DS had proven on a balance of probabilities that it had not delayed its work and was within time to complete its works had it not been for the breach of LBE. I also found that, on a balance of probabilities, the work of DS had not been “shoddy”, and that it was DS that had terminated the work pursuant to the breach of LBE.

15     I also rejected the claim of LBE that DS had failed to provide outstanding “cube-test” reports. On a balance of probabilities, DS had shown that they were not lacking in this respect.

16     As support for their Counterclaim against DS, LBE had pleaded that they “had to engage an alternative sub-contractor”. The evidence on this point was lacking on the part of LBE. There was insufficient evidence tendered to show that a sub-contractor had been paid to carry out works that DS had contracted to carry out and which had been left undone. The Counterclaim of LBE was dismissed; in any event, I had held that LBE was the party in breach and that DS had been entitled to stop work due to the late certification and payment, and non-payment of the progress claims put forward by DS.

17     Central to this dispute between DS and LBE was when payment was to be effected pursuant to the LOA. The payment mechanism was contained in paragraph 5.0 of the LOA under the rubric, “Payment Terms”. LBE appeared to have a certain reading and understanding of the operation of this clause, but in my view, this interpretation was erroneous.

18     The “Payment Terms” are set out, _verbatim_:

> “a)     You (DS) shall submit on the 25th month an itemised Progress Claim for the portion of works done up to the date of claim.

> b)     LBE shall issue a valuation within 15 days and the subsequent

> c)     All progress payment shall be subject to 10% retention accumulating up to maximum limit of 5% of the awarded Sub-Contract Sum.”

19     It is clear on reading the “Payment Terms”, that this clause is incomplete in parts, and vague in others. For example, it does not specifically state that DS would be paid after “valuation”: however, it appeared to be the understanding of parties that payment would be made, and that these would be progressive payments.

20     What was in contention between parties, was when DS would have to submit these “Progress Claims”. There does not appear to be a dispute that “the 25th month” meant the 25th of the month. LBE appeared to understand, however, that once a claim was made, say, on the 26th of the month, it would only need to be considered _the next month, as if it was a claim made the following month_.

21     There is nothing express in this clause to support the interpretation of LBE. It was, after all, their document, and they could have drafted it in a clearer manner, if they wanted to state in no uncertain terms that a claim made after the 25th of any particular month stood to be considered only in the following month.

22     Further, there is sub-paragraph (b), which states in an apparent incomplete fashion, “LBE shall issue a valuation within 15 days and the subsequent” without a punctuation mark thereafter. The words “and the subsequent” appear superfluous.

23     The sub-paragraph (b) appears directive, and mandates that LBE issues the valuation within 15 days of a submission of a claim by DS. To reiterate, a reading of the whole of this clause would suggest that there is nothing to state that a claim submitted after the 25th of a particular month may be considered and evaluated by LBE the following month: the valuation has to be issued “within 15 days” after the claim. Allowing for the interpretation of LBE (in the absence of clear words) would be to render the obligation of LBE to “issue a valuation within 15 days” nugatory.

24     Consequently, I agreed with the submission of DS that LBE had been dilatory in their conduct with regard to the progress claims made by DS. The prompt payment of progress claims in this industry is essential to ensuring that works are carried out in an efficient manner. The timely inflow of funds for works that have been completed in an ongoing project is very important for sub-contractors such as DS. As the LOA was drafted by LBE, they could have made their intention clear: as drafted, the clause relating to progress claims, as discussed above, had to be interpretated against LBE’s understanding of its purport.

25     On a balance of probabilities, I found in favour of DS. LBE had been in breach of their obligations under the LOA and DS was entitled to hold LBE in breach of the contract. DS was entitled to stop work as they did, and were entitled to Judgment as set out above.
