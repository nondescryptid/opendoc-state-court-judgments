Criminal Law – Offences – Voluntarily Causing Hurt

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9074/2020/01-02 and MA 9076/2020/01-02.\]

6 July 2020

### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       The accused Leong Tuck Kwong (B1) was convicted after trial of the following charge (as amended by the court):-

> DAC 903666/2018

> \[a\]re charged that you, on 10 August 2017, at or about 9:55 pm, in the vicinity of Tuas Checkpoint Complex, 501 Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Nyu Tiong Lam, _to wit_, by punching him on his face and head, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       At the same trial, Chan Kok Leng (B2) was convicted of the following charge which was also amended by the court:-

> DAC 903665/2018

> \[a\]re charged that you, on 10 August 2017, at or about 9:55 pm, in the vicinity of Tuas Checkpoint Complex, 501 Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Nyu Tiong Lam, _to wit_, by punching him on his face and upper torso, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

3       Each accused person was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. Both have filed appeals against conviction and sentence. They have been released on bail pending appeal.

4       The prosecution initially proceeded on charges which alleged that the accused persons had a common intention to cause grievous hurt to the victim Nyu Tiong Lam (“Nyu”), punishable under s 325 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. This was on the basis that Nyu had suffered a minimally displaced fracture of the facial bone. However, it was doubtful that a common intention existed between the accused persons on the terms advanced in the prosecution’s case theory. In particular, Nyu’s evidence left room for doubt as to whether B1 and B2 shared the common intention to cause grievous hurt to him.

5       As the prosecution failed to establish which of the accused persons inflicted the grievous injury on Nyu, the charges were amended by the court to causing hurt simpliciter, punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code and the accused persons convicted thereon. The prosecution has not filed any appeal against this course of action taken by the court. However, it has filed an appeal against sentence.

## Background Facts

6       On the evening of 10 August 2017, the accused persons were returning to Singapore from Malaysia via the Second Link and Tuas Checkpoint. They were in B1’s car (registration number SFY 1808C,) which B1 was driving. B2 was seated in the front passenger seat. At the same time, Nyu was also returning from Malaysia in a Malaysian registered car (registration number JPA 2648) driven by his female friend Chan Pek Yee (“Ms Chan”). He was seated in the front passenger seat.

7       There was a bad traffic jam at the Second Link. B1’s car was directly behind Ms Chan’s car. B1 and B2 were unhappy about how Ms Chan was driving. In particular, they were annoyed and frustrated that Ms Chan had allowed other cars to cut in front of her. B1 sounded his horn several times at Ms Chan.

8       When they were quite near the Singapore Immigration Complex at a location known at trial as “OP5 Cat Claw” or “gantry 2”, B1 sounded his horn at Ms Chan as she did not enter the yellow box, allowing other cars to cut in. This led to a confrontation between Nyu, B1 and B2, the details of which are in issue.

9       The altercation was spotted by Fairuz Ahmad s/o Muhstak Ahmad (PW8) (“Fairuz”) who was then a Certis Cisco officer. He proceeded to the scene and separated Nyu and B2. He then asked the parties to get into their cars and proceed to the Tuas Checkpoint Complex. ASP Tan Yong Zhi (PW9), who was stationed at Tuas Checkpoint as a team leader arrived soon after and interviewed both B1 and B2.

10     For his part, Nyu was charged with causing hurt to B1 and B2, punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code. He pleaded guilty to both counts and was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment per charge, with sentence to run concurrently.

## The Prosecution’s Case

### Evidence of Nyu (PW3)

11     On that day, Nyu (PW3) was coming to Singapore from Malaysia with Ms Chan. They were intending to go to Bukit Timah to eat chicken rice. There was a heavy traffic jam and they reached Tuas checkpoint at around 9.00 p.m.. B1’s car which was directly behind Ms Chan’s car sounded its horn more than ten times. A car had also cut into the path of Ms Chan’s car. Nyu claimed that he told Ms Chan that it was alright for the car behind to sound its horn as they were in a traffic jam.[^1]

12     Nyu testified that B2 came out of B1’s car, knocked on his window and asked him to come out of Ms Chan’s car. B2 spoke in Hokkien and sounded very aggressive. He shouted, “Come down, come down, Can you drive? Have you a licence to drive? Do you know how to drive?” When B2 turned back and moved towards B1’s car, Ms Chan asked him to get out of her car and look at the registration number of B1’s car.[^2]

13     When Nyu got out of the car, B2 ran up to him and asked what he was looking at, uttering a vulgarity in the process. B2 pushed him towards Ms Chan’s car. He was very aggressive and Nyu did not know how to react. Nyu’s leg got caught between the door and the side of Ms Chan’s car. He felt pain and alighted from the car. He told B2, “Young man, it is because of the traffic jam. Don’t try to be nasty.” However, B2 assumed a fighting stance and raised both his fists, followed by a hand gesture towards the sky. He and B2 then got into a fight. B2 raised his hand and threw a punch at him. He tried to catch B2’s hand but B2 hit him, causing him to fall backwards. B2 hit him on his face and body, which caused him to become dazed. B1 then came up to them and hit him until he fell. He felt pain. The police then arrived and separated them.[^3]

### Medical report on Nyu

14     Nyu was conveyed to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in an ambulance. The medical report on Nyu (Exhibit P4) stated that he gave a history of being punched in the face, cheek, nose and left eye by two assailants. He complained of bleeding from the nose and pain on the left cheek.

15     On examination, Nyu was found to have a mild subconjunctival haemorrhage on the medial side of his left eye. There was dried blood in his nostrils. He also had tenderness on his left maxillary area. He had mild abrasions on his left arm and right knee. An X-ray revealed that his nasal bone “showed minimally displaced fracture of the facial bone”. He was given medical leave from 11 to 15 August 2017 and referred to the Ear Nose and Throat Clinic.

### Evidence of Fairuz (PW8)

16     At the material time, Fairuz was a Certis Cisco officer deployed to Tuas Checkpoint. His duties included maintaining security and looking after traffic. He was deployed to “Observation Point 5” (“OP5”). While he was standing outside OP5, he witnessed some events happening about 110 metres away at “gantry 2”.

17     He noticed a large gap in the traffic of about 50 metres or more to gantry 2. He saw a few people outside their vehicles. He saw two males (whom he later identified as B2 and Nyu) grabbing each other’s shirts and punching each other. They were in the centre lane. He used his communications set and reported the matter to his Operations Room. He observed for about ten seconds then rushed towards the people who were fighting.[^4]

18     Fairuz testified that B2 and Nyu were scuffling by grabbing each other’s shirts. B1 was trying to pull B2 back by the shoulder. He saw B2 and Nyu throw three to five punches at each other. His observation lasted about ten seconds. When he reached them, he tried to pull B2 and Nyu apart by their shoulders, but they were in a clinch. He then tried to push them away from each other, and both of them separated and fell down. He shouted at them to get back to their vehicles and they did so. He took their passports and directed them to drive towards the Tuas Checkpoint Complex, after which the police took over the case.[^5]

### Evidence of ASP Tan Yong Zhi (PW9)

19     ASP Tan was on 10 August 2017, a team leader posted to Tuas Checkpoint. His role was to manage a team of officers. On that day, he heard Fairuz report what he saw. He responded and went to the scene where he interviewed B1 and B2. His deputy went with him and interviewed Nyu and Ms Chan.

20     He noticed that Nyu, B1 and B2 all had injuries to their facial areas.[^6] He spoke to them mainly in Mandarin with a mix of English. When he interviewed B1 and B2, their accounts were that Nyu had come of out the vehicle and started the trouble. Both B1 and B2 informed him that in retaliation, they assaulted Nyu. He testified that in order to determine if this was a case of voluntarily causing hurt or an affray, he specifically asked each of them if he had punched Nyu. Each of them replied that he did so. ASP Tan then proceeded to ask IO Corelle Tan to arrest B1 and B2 for an offence of affray.[^7]

### Statement of Ms Chan

21     Ms Chan who was the driver of the Malaysian registered car was not called as a witness. Her statement (Exhibit P9) was admitted in evidence on the basis that she could not be located. In evaluating the evidence, no weight was placed on her statement. It was not tested under cross-examination and I assessed her evidence to be of no value.

## The case for the defence

### Evidence of B1

22     B1 testified that on 10 August 2017, B2 and he went on a day trip to Bukit Indah in Malaysia. On their return, they cleared Malaysian immigration sometime after 6 p.m. and proceeded towards Singapore. He was driving on the right lane. He allowed Ms Chan’s car to cut in front of him, but she slowed down. She was inattentive and a number of cars overtook them from the left. He claimed that Ms Chan was holding onto her mobile phone with her right hand and talking on the phone. At times, she momentarily let go of her steering wheel. He felt that she was driving in a dangerous manner and that she posed a hazard to B2 and him. He also noticed Ms Chan and Nyu conversing very emotionally. They looked at each other and gestured with their hands.[^8]

23     According to B2, the jam towards Singapore started at the foot of the Second Link bridge. Ms Chan’s car was directly in front of his. When they were near the top of the bridge, Ms Chan’s car rolled back and he sounded his horn at her. Her car continued to roll back and he sounded his horn again, this time harder. Ms Chan then braked and moved forwards. B2 informed him that he wanted to go and talk to the driver of the car in front. B2 wanted to tell her to be more attentive and to follow the car in front of her properly.[^9]

24     B2 opened the door and got out of the car. Nyu also got out and met B2 halfway. The car behind started to sound its horn as they were obstructing traffic. When B1 observed the talking getting more heated up, he put on his hazard lights, got out of the car and pushed B2 back into his car. B1 also ushered Nyu back to Ms Chan’s car by putting his right hand behind Nyu’s back. Nyu agreed to go back and thanked him. He told Nyu to tell the driver to concentrate and move on. B1 “assisted” Nyu to sit in Ms Chan’s car. Nyu closed the door himself.[^10]

25     Ms Chan continued to drive inattentively and allowed many cars to cut into her lane. B1 wanted to filter to a different lane but could not. He therefore continued to drive behind her. About one and a half hours’ later, they reached the gantry sign “Welcome to Singapore” where a yellow box was painted on the road beneath it. Ms Chan stopped before the yellow box. This allowed four to five cars to cut in front of her. The people behind were also not happy. B1 and the cars behind started to sound their horns.[^11]

26     Nyu angrily opened the door and got out of Ms Chan’s car. B2 also got out of the car and approached Nyu. Nyu beat the air with his right hand and shouted “369 Bukit Ho Swee”, which B1 felt was a gangster slogan. He was worried and fearful and did not want to have anything to do with Nyu. However, he observed that Nyu was angry and pushed B2. He feared for B2’s safety and was worried there might be an escalation. He then put on his hazard lights, got out of his car and approached them. He noticed that Ms Chan was already back in her car. He asked her why she stopped and she said that it was because of the yellow box. He told her that this was not an ordinary yellow box and shouted at her that if she did not agree, she could go and report the matter to the police. He then rushed to separate Nyu and B2.[^12]

27     He pushed B2 back to his car. He then ushered Nyu back to Ms Chan’s car by putting his right hand behind Nyu’s back and pointing to Ms Chan’s car with his left hand. Nyu was angry but did not object. B1 assisted Nyu to sit down. A car overtook them and asked them not to create trouble and to move on. B1 tilted his head to face Ms Chan and at this stage, he felt a punch to his face. This caused a cut to his lips and his nose to bleed. His spectacles fell and the left lens of his spectacles broke. He was fearful and frightened that another series of punches would come as he saw Nyu coming out of the car. He panicked and his mind went blank. Out of basic instinct, he clenched his fist and swung it aimlessly. Still in a daze, he stumbled backwards but felt someone supporting him from the back. When he swung his fist, he felt his hand make an impact. He testified that he could have hit Nyu in the process. He was not sure how many times he hit Nyu. Once he retrieved his spectacles and managed to collect himself, the police had arrived. Nyu and B2 were sitting on the floor.[^13]

## Evidence of B2

28     B2 gave evidence that he and his good friend B1 had gone to Malaysia that day in B1’s car. When returning to Singapore via the Tuas Second Link, they cleared Malaysian immigration at about 6 p.m.. There was a heavy traffic jam which started shortly before they entered the Second Link bridge. Ms Chan’s car cut in front of them before the jam formed. When the cars moved forward in the jam, Ms Chan did not. She was using her phone. B1 sounded his horn gently once. The cars behind also honked at Ms Chan. Other cars switched lanes and cut in front of Ms Chan. This happened at least twice. When they were approaching the top of the bridge, Ms Chan’s car rolled backwards. B1 honked at her for about two seconds. When the car continued to roll backwards, B1 sounded the horn louder for about five seconds as he was afraid that Ms Chan’s car would collide with his car. Ms Chan’s quickly braked and travelled up the bridge.[^14]

29     B2 observed that Nyu and Ms Chan were talking and gesturing aggressively in the car and he thought that they were unhappy. Nyu then got out of the car and walked towards them. He alighted as he thought that Nyu wanted to talk to him. B2 stated that Nyu asked him, “Are you looking for trouble? You keep honking at me for what?” He explained that if they did not honk, Ms Chan’s car would have caused a collision. At that point, B1 alighted from the car. B1 told him to return to the car and he walked back slowly. B1 also asked Nyu to return to Ms Chan’s car, using his hands to bring Nyu back to the car.[^15]

30     They then proceeded on their journey. When they reached the yellow box near the Singapore Immigration Complex, it was close to 9 p.m.. Ms Chan stopped before the yellow box and did not enter. At least five to six other cars cut in front of her. B1 sounded his horn at Ms Chan twice and the other cars behind sounded their horns as well.[^16]

31     Nyu then alighted from Ms Chan’s car and approached them. He looked very angry. When B2 opened his door, he heard Nyu say, “If you were not happy you can go to Bukit Ho Swee … 369 to look for me.” Although he was a bit afraid, B2 got out and walked towards Nyu until they were at arm’s length. He told Nyu, “If there was anything wrong with us honking at you, you could make a police report back in Singapore.”[^17]

32     B2 noticed that B1 had also alighted from his car. B1 stood between Nyu and him. B1 invited Nyu to return to Ms Chan’s car and asked him to return to his car. When he was near B1’s car, he heard the sound of a fight. He saw B1 taking some steps back. It looked as if B1 had been hit. He saw Nyu coming out from Ms Chan’s car. Nyu clenched his right fist and raised it in the air. It looked like Nyu wanted to punch someone. B2 then tried to push Nyu away but Nyu hit him on his left temple. When he was hit, he pushed anyone or anything close to him. However, he fell to the ground and may have suffered abrasions to his left elbow and right knee in the process. The police then came over and pushed Nyu away. According to B2, he lost consciousness momentarily when Nyu hit him. He came to when the police arrived, woke him up and tapped on him. He was lying on the ground facing upwards. Nyu was also lying on the ground.[^18]

### Medical report on B2

33     B2 was attended to by Dr Ng JY from Healthway Medical on 11 August 2017 at 6.15 a.m.. The medical report on him (Exhibit D2) stated that there were two abrasions on his left elbow; a 2 cm by 2 cm bruise over his left cheek and two abrasions on his right knee. He was well and had no facial tenderness, shortness of breath, blurring of vision or diplopia.

## The issues

34     The relevant issue was whether B1 and B2 punched Nyu as stated in the amended charges and if so, whether any defences were available to them.

## Evaluation of evidence

### Nyu was undoubtedly a flawed witness

35     As the prosecution had in effect conceded, Nyu was a flawed witness who gave inconsistent accounts of what transpired. Both defence counsel submitted at length that his evidence should be rejected due to the different inconsistent accounts he provided. I agreed with this to some extent. I found that some doubts arose over whether B1 and B2 had attacked Nyu in the manner outlined by the prosecution and that this affected the issue of whether they shared a common intention.

36     The accused persons were originally charged with having a common intention to cause grievous hurt to Nyu. The prosecution’s case theory was that the accused persons had acted in concert and initiated the violence by pushing Nyu to Ms Chan’s car. B2 acted aggressively and threw the first punch at Nyu. Nyu then retaliated by punching B2. At this juncture, B1 joined in the fray and attacked Nyu together with B2. B1 and B2 then punched Nyu multiple times on his face and head.[^19]

37     The prosecution’s case theory was diametrically opposed to its case when Nyu pleaded guilty to causing hurt to B1 and B2. The Statement of Facts in Nyu’s case (“Nyu’s SOF”) stated at \[4\] that B1 and Nyu had first exchanged punches and that B2 then went to join in.[^20] The prosecution did not forward any explanation as to why there was a discrepancy on who had first engaged with Nyu or why two very different case theories were advanced in relation to the same event.

38     The unexplained discrepancy as to whether B1 or B2 had first punched Nyu was material. The sequence of events set out in Nyu’s SOF was more consistent with the defence narrative that Nyu and B1 had first engaged and that when B2 arrived later, he pushed Nyu away. Doubts were cast on whether the prosecution’s case theory represented the true state of affairs. The benefit of the doubt had therefore to be extended to the defence on the issue of common intention.

39     Although I rejected Nyu’s account as to how the events unfolded, this did not mean that I had to reject his allegation that both accused persons had punched him. As the prosecution (relying on _Osman bin Ramli v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 203</span>) submitted, even though Nyu was a flawed witness, this did not mean he was an untruthful witness. The court was entitled to determine which part of his evidence remained credible despite the inconsistencies. The court had to scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspects of his evidence may be accepted as true and which may be disregarded.

40     Although a scrutiny of Nyu’s evidence showed that it was internally and externally inconsistent in many respects, he maintained throughout that both accused persons had punched him. This was a credible claim. It was supported by medical evidence which showed that Nyu had sustained injuries to his face. More importantly, it was supported by strong corroborative evidence which showed that B1 and B2 had punched Nyu. Having found that it was doubtful that a common intention existed between B1 and B2, the appropriate course was to amend the charges pursuant to s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code to one of voluntarily causing hurt punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code. The discussion which follows will deal with the evidence in relation to this offence.

### Nyu’s allegation that both B1 and B2 punched him was strongly corroborated by other evidence

41     There was strong corroboration of Nyu’s claim that both B1 and B2 had punched him. In B1’s case, he confessed to the police on multiple occasions that he punched Nyu in retaliation. In the case of B2, Nyu’s claim that B1 punched him in the head and body was corroborated by Fairuz, an independent witness whose evidence was persuasive. These were sufficient to corroborate Nyu’s evidence and to form the basis of the convictions against B1 and B2. However, further support was available from the evidence of ASP Tan Yong Zhi who testified that B1 and B2 had separately admitted to punching Nyu.

### B1 confessed on multiple occasions to punching Nyu

42     B1 gave four statements to the police. In all of them, he admitted to punching Nyu. His first statement (Exhibit P6) was recorded on 11 August 2017 at 10.02 a.m. by SSG Jerry Sim. He stated that when Nyu came out of Ms Chan’s car to confront them, B2 also got out of his car and a dispute arose. He heard Nyu shout that he was from the 369 gang from Bukit Ho Swee. B1 then got out of his car to break up the dispute. He pushed B2 back to his car. He also pushed Nyu into Ms Chan’s car and closed the car door. Suddenly Nyu punched him once in his face and his spectacles dropped. He retaliated by punching Nyu’s face once or twice. B2 also came out of the car to help him when he saw Nyu trying to assault him again. He did not know what happened after that as he was trying to look for his spectacles. He also expressed regret at what he had done.

43     In his second statement (Exhibit P7) which was recorded on 11 August 2017 at 4.52 p.m. by ASP Wang Yixin, B1 re-iterated that when he pushed Nyu towards Ms Chan’s car, Nyu punched him. He retaliated by punching Nyu back once or twice. The first punch definitely landed on Nyu’s face but he did not know where the second punch landed. He also stated that the incident was a stupid mistake. He punched Nyu in the heat of the moment and truly regretted doing so.

44     In his third statement (Exhibit P8) which was recorded on 13 November 2017 by ASP Wang Yixin, B1 stated that as he was pushing Nyu back to his car, Nyu punched him in his face. He then punched Nyu on the head or face once. B2 came to his assistance. He did not see B2 punching Nyu, but only pushing him. B2 and Nyu pushed each other and both of them fell to the ground. B1 also expressed his remorse over the incident. He admitted that he had made a mistake and that he had to pay for it.

45     Lastly, in his cautioned statement (Exhibit P11) which was recorded on 23 January 2018 by ASP Wang Yixin, B1 admitted that he had reacted to Nyu’s punch on his face. He also stated that he had learnt from his mistakes and sincerely hoped to have a lighter sentence.

### B1’s confessions were reliable and attributed full weight

46     I gave full weight to B1’s confessions. There was no reason for him to incriminate himself on multiple occasions if he did not punch Nyu. Further, he failed to raise the issue of self-defence or any other defences in any of his statements. Instead, he consistently maintained over a period of five months that he punched Nyu in retaliation and that he regretted what he did.

47     There was no reason to doubt the truth of B1’s confessions or regard them as unreliable. He did not challenge the voluntariness of his statements. All his statements were read back to him. He understood the contents and signed on them.[^21] In his examination-in-chief, B1 did not even try to explain why he confessed to deliberately punching Nyu if this was not the case. It was only in cross-examination that he proffered various incoherent and unconvincing reasons as to why he had confessed.[^22]

48     B1 alleged in cross-examination that his statements were not properly recorded. This was a bare allegation as he did not detail precisely why this was so. He testified that after going through trial and listening to all the evidence, he felt the need to elaborate a bit more and provide a full chronological order of events. This clearly showed that he attempting to tailor his evidence to account for what other witnesses said in court. B1 did not in any event explain why he confessed if he was indeed innocent. Further, it was never put by counsel that the statements were not properly recorded, nor did the defence object to the admission of the statements.[^23]

49     Defence counsel also submitted that due to B1’s lack of proficiency in the English language, B1 had used language in his statements imprecisely. I did not accept this submission which had no valid factual basis. It was not even put to the statement recorders that B1 was not proficient in English or that he was imprecise in the use of language. The statements showed unequivocally that B1 had informed the police that he had deliberately punched Nyu. If he had stated that he had just swung his arms aimlessly (as he testified in court), there would be no reason for this to have been omitted from his statements. It was not put that the recorders of the statements failed to record what B1 had informed them. It was also open to B1 to amend the statements to reflect this. In my assessment, the discrepancies between B1’s statements and his evidence in court were material and showed that his testimony was concocted as an afterthought.

### B1’s claim of self-defence was unconvincing

50     In his defence, B1 alleged that after Nyu hit him, he swung his arms aimlessly to defend himself and may have hit Nyu in the process. I did not find this defence to be credible. B1’s claim that he was acting in self-defence was clearly contradicted by his statements to the police where he maintained on multiple occasions that he retaliated and punched Nyu. This was inconsistent with his evidence that he swung his arms aimlessly to protect himself. He also failed to raise the issue of self-defence in any of his statements to the police.

51     To explain why he failed to inform the police of his defence, B1 deflected the blame to the recorders of the statements. In the context of Exhibit P7, he claimed that the police told him, “Regardless of whether you are self-defence or not as long as you hit somebody you are wrong.” He therefore came to terms with what he did and admitted he was wrong.[^24] The purport of B1’s evidence was that he had raised the issue of self-defence but this was not recorded by the recorder, who dismissed the issue. However, this was never put to the prosecution witnesses. B1 was free to insert the issue of self-defence in Exhibit P7 if he chose to do so. He confirmed in cross-examination that the police did not instruct him to admit in paragraph (h) of Exhibit P7 that it was a stupid mistake and that he had punched Nyu in the heat of the moment.

52     B1 also failed to raise the issue of self-defence in his cautioned statement (Exhibit P11). He admitted that the charge was read to him, the caution administered, he understood and then signed the statement. He admitted in cross-examination that he had used the specific words set out in the cautioned statement which were as follows:-[^25]

> I felt sorry for Mr Nyu. I had never intended to fight and least to cause hurt to Mr Nyu.

> In act of a foolish way and at an instant of fury I reacted to a punch on my face thus caused this unnecessary happening.

> I had learnt from this mistake and sincerely hope to have a lighter sentence of the court.

53     Thus, not only did B1 fail to state his defence, but he proceeded to implicate himself by admitting that he reacted in a state of fury. This rendered his late claim of self-defence totally implausible. He tried to explain his admission by stating that he did not know the severity of the offence. This was not a relevant consideration as he was obliged to tell the truth as to what occurred, instead of tailoring his statement according to the severity of the offence,

54     The preponderance of the evidence established that B1 had unreservedly confessed to the police on multiple occasions to punching Nyu in retaliation. I was satisfied that this represented the truth. Although B1 had ample opportunity to raise the issue of private defence in his statements to the police, he failed to do so. I was of the view that his claim of self-defence was a mere afterthought which was unworthy of belief.

### Fairuz gave reliable independent evidence and corroborated Nyu’s claim that B2 punched him

55     Nyu’s evidence that B2 punched him was corroborated by Fairuz. Fairuz was an honest independent witness who had no reason to tell untruths about what he saw. He was certain about his observation that B2 and Nyu had grabbed each other’s shirts and punched each other and that B1 was trying to pull B2 away. His evidence was consistent and not shaken under cross-examination.

56     I did not accept any suggestion that his observation was compromised because of factors such as car lights shining towards him or that he could only see small silhouettes of the persons involved.[^26] Fairuz testified in re-examination that he had a clear line of sight to B2 and Nyu and could see what was going on.[^27] This was credible as he had noticed a huge gap in the traffic leading to Ms Chan’s car. This gap made it unlikely that his vision was obstructed. Further, as he moved towards the altercation, he would have been able to observe the events more and more clearly. As he was moving towards them, he could see them grabbing each other’s shirts and punching each other.[^28]

57     In my assessment, Fairuz’s evidence was reliable and deserved to be accorded full weight. If he could not see B2 punching Nyu, he would have stated as such. His evidence served as strong independent corroboration of Nyu’s evidence that B2 had punched him. On the other hand, B2’s claim that he only pushed Nyu was not corroborated. Fairuz’s evidence squarely contradicted B2’s claim that he did not punch Nyu. Even though B1 was trying to separate B2 from Nyu and would have been able to observe what exactly happened, he did not testify that B2 did not punch Nyu. Instead, he was evasive on this issue.

58     In view of these circumstances, I was satisfied that the prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt that B2 had punched Nyu.

### It was doubtful that B2 was merely defending B1 or himself

59     In his closing submissions, B2’s counsel failed to specifically raise the issue of private defence and how this was established. It was therefore disingenuous to claim in the plea-in-mitigation at \[19\] that B2 was acting in defence of B1.[^29] I will nonetheless proceed to deal with the issue of private defence.

60     While it was plausible that B2 pushed Nyu away from B1 when they were fighting, B2 failed to explain why it was thereafter necessary to punch Nyu in exercise of his purported right of private defence. There was nothing to show that by punching Nyu, B2 was acting in defence of B1 or himself. As Fairuz testified, while B2 and Nyu were punching each other, B1 was trying to separate them. It was therefore unlikely that B1 was in any danger when B2 punched Nyu or that this was necessary to protect B1. B2 did not therefore establish any justifiable reason for punching Nyu.

## Finding of guilt

61     Taking into account the totality of the evidence, I found that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving the amended charges against both B1 and B2 beyond a reasonable doubt. They were therefore found guilty and convicted.

## Sentence

62     In the oral submissions on sentence, the prosecution urged the court to sentence each accused to four months’ imprisonment. It was contended that as there was moderate harm, the indicated sentencing range in _Public Prosecutor v Low Song Chye_ \[2019\] 5 SLR 140 would be between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment. As for the aggravating factors, this was a road rage case. Nyu was assaulted on his head, a vulnerable part. The incident occurred in a very public place in full view of the public. There was a high degree of disruption caused by the altercation, which exacerbated the already bad traffic jam. Further, no sentencing discount should be offered to the accused persons as they had claimed trial.[^30]

63     In his plea-in-mitigation, counsel for B1 urged the court to impose a fine of $4,000 to $5,000. He informed the court that B1 was a 59-year old divorcee who was semi-retired. He had previously owned a company dealing with lighting and security installations. He looked after his aged mother who had stage four breast cancer. The offence was out of character. He was remorseful and undertook not to repeat the same mistake again. It was submitted that this could not be considered a road rage case as the offence was not committed against the driver of the car in front and as B1 had been angered and provoked by events outside his vehicle.

64     In his plea-in-mitigation for B2, counsel submitted that a fine of $4,000 was the appropriate sentence. He informed the court that B2 was a grab driver who was friendly, trustworthy, respectful and generous. He had little savings. Given his good character, he was unlikely to re-offend. The harm caused by B2 was only tenderness to Nyu’s left maxillary area. Counsel also submitted that this was not a road rage case as B2 only got involved after B1 was attacked by Nyu. Counsel informed the court that a custodial sentence could impact B2’s vulnerable financial position. He could lose his license as a real estate agent, and his two pet dogs would have no one to care for them in his absence.

65     In _Public Prosecutor v Lim Yee Hua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1106</span> (“_Lim Yee Hua_”), Chan Seng Onn, J provided a definition of what a road rage case would entail. He stated at \[21\]:-

> 21    In my view, an incident of violence should be labelled as an episode of road rage violence only where the facts disclose violence perpetrated by road users as a result of real or perceived slights by other road users stemming from differences that arise in the course of the shared use of our roads. The litmus test for whether the deterrent sentencing policy associated with road rage offences should apply for a particular offence of violence is thus whether the violence originates from differences arising through common road use. In other words, the harsh deterrent sanctions for road rage incidents only apply when road users engage in violence _specifically_ over disputes that arise from the shared use of our roads. It follows that where incidents of violence happen to break out on the roads, but the cause of the violence has _no nexus to the parties’ shared use of the roads_, the road rage deterrent sentencing policy should _not_ apply.

66     I agreed with the prosecution that this was a case involving road rage. In my view, the violence was perpetrated due to differences that arose over the shared use of the road. Both B1 and B2 were clearly frustrated by how Ms Chan had been driving. A large part of the cross-examination by defence counsel centred on the manner in which Ms Chan had driven and whether she had used her mobile phone. Whether Nyu or B2 stepped out first was not a material consideration, since B2 was clearly willing to square up to Nyu. B1 also stepped out to confront Nyu. By B1’s own admission he used force by pushing Nyu towards Ms Chan’s car. Even if B2 had pushed Nyu away from B1 when they were fighting, it would be artificial to say that the violence did not stem from his anger over the shared use of the roads when the issue of Ms Chan’s driving had been simmering all evening.

67     In any event, whether or not this was a case involving road rage, a deterrent custodial sentence was called for due to the circumstances under which the offences were committed. In relation to the harm caused, Chan J noted at \[27\] in _Lim Yee Hua_, that the following factors are relevant:-

> … The harm caused by the offence would invoke the considerations of the nature and degree of: (a) personal injury directly sustained by the victim; (b) collateral harm or damage caused to other persons or property respectively; and (c) disruption or distress caused to the public...

68     Although Nyu had suffered grievous hurt, the prosecution could not prove which of the accused persons had inflicted the grievous injury on him. Contrary to the prosecution’s submissions, the court could not sentence either of the accused persons on the basis that he had caused grievous hurt. The harm caused to Nyu had to be considered as simple hurt as stated in the amended charges.

69     Disruption or distress caused to the public were relevant in assessing the harm caused. Alternatively, this was an aggravating factor. The assaults by B1 and B2 on Nyu occurred at the Second Link, a strategic gateway between Singapore and Malaysia, which thousands of motor vehicles use every day. Traffic was very bad that day. Many cars were caught in a bad traffic jam from Malaysia to Singapore. The actions of B1 and B2 caused a serious traffic disruption. Other road users were inconvenienced and distress must have been caused to them. Public disquiet was occasioned due to the conduct of B1 and B2. In view of the distress and disruption caused to the public, the harm caused was moderate.

70     In assessing culpability, Chan, J had stated in _Lim Yee Hua_ at \[27\]:-

> On the other hand, the culpability of the offender would primarily involve an assessment of the manner in which the assault was carried out (_eg_, the duration of the assault, whether the attacks were onesided or aimed at a vulnerable part of the body, or whether a weapon was used).

71     In terms of culpability, while Nyu may have thrown the first punch, I did not assess the culpability of both accused persons to be significantly lower than his. Both accused persons had responded more than equally and prolonged the altercation. They had punched Nyu in his head and face which are vulnerable parts of his body. I assessed their culpability as being low to moderate.

72     There were no aggravating factors which were specific to the accused persons. Both had no similar antecedents. There were no significant mitigating factors raised in their favour. In view of the harm which was caused, it was necessary for a deterrent custodial sentence to be imposed. Offenders who resort to acts of violence at our border crossings should face harsh prison sentences.

73     In considering parity of sentence, Nyu had pleaded guilty to assaulting B1 and B2 which showed his remorse. He was sentenced to a total of three weeks’ imprisonment. B1 and B2 displayed no remorse and proceeded with trial, where they did not even admit to punching Nyu. They were therefore not entitled to any sentencing discount associated with a plea of guilt.

74     Taking into account the sentencing considerations, it was just and proportional to impose a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment on each accused person. They were sentenced accordingly.
