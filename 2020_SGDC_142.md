Civil procedure – costs – principles

24 June 2020

### District Judge Loo Ngan Chor:

1       This decision on costs is supplementary to my decision of 15th April 2020, reported at <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 98</span>, by which I dismissed both the claim and the counter-claim, with costs to be fixed by me, if necessary, after I had the benefit of parties’ submissions on costs.

2       There has been no appeal against the principal decision.

3       The plaintiff submits that I should make no order as to costs. Its argument is that the counter-claim raised a point distinct from the defence, in the form of “the issue of the plaintiff’s failure to make payment for the construction works done by the defendant up till sometime on or around April 2014… Accordingly, the breach of the plaintiff’s obligation to make payment to the defendant is the separate and substantial question raised by the defendant”.

4       The plaintiff relies on the Court of Appeal decision in _Benzline Auto Pte Ltd_ v _Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd and anr_ \[2018\] 2 SLR 239 at \[76\]-\[80\]. In calling for parties’ submissions on costs, at \[78\] of the _Benzline_ decision, the Court of Appeal said this:

> 78    For the parties’ guidance, we observe that this is a case where both the plaintiffs’ claim and the defendant’s counterclaim should have been (and have now been) dismissed. The applicable principles as to costs in such an outcome are accurately summarised in the headnote to _Mok Kwong Yue v Ding Leng Kong_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 737</span> as follows:

>> (1)    … in a situation where both a claim and the counterclaim failed and were dismissed with costs and where there was a separate and substantial question raised by the counterclaim, there had to be substantial costs paid by the defendant to the plaintiff in relation to the counterclaim, and an apportionment of the costs. But where the subject matter of the counterclaim was identical to the defence or part of the defence, no apportionment should be ordered, but rather the plaintiff should be allowed only the extra costs incurred by reason of the counterclaim. …

5       The context of this issue is set out in the earlier part of the headnote of _Mok Kwong Yue_, which bears setting out for my purpose:

> In 2004, Mok Kwong Yue (“the plaintiff”) sued Ding Leng Kong (“the defendant”) to recover monies allegedly paid under mistake of law. The defendant resisted the claim and mounted a counterclaim. The judge dismissed both the claim and the counterclaim with costs (see <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 65</span>).

> In November 2010, the plaintiff presented his bill of costs for the work done in respect of the counterclaim for taxation. The defendant only filed the defendant’s bill of costs for the work done in resisting the claim on 28 September 2011. The plaintiff claimed, _inter alia_, $80,000 in respect of getting up for the counterclaim. The assistant registrar (“the AR”) awarded the plaintiff $7,000, applying the principle in _Medway Oil and Storage Company, Limited v Continental Contractors, Limited_ <span class="citation">\[1929\] 1 AC 88</span> (_“Medway”_) that where the counterclaim arose from the defence to the main claim, no apportionment would be ordered but rather extra costs arising from the counterclaim could be allowed. The defendant appealed and argued that the principles in _Christie v Platt_ <span class="citation">\[1921\] 2 KB 17</span> (_“Christie v Platt”_) were applicable: namely that costs should be apportioned between the plaintiff and defendant where each had been successful (_ie_, on the claim and counterclaim respectively) in accordance with a consideration of how much of each item of costs had been incurred in relation to either the claim or counterclaim.

6        _Mok Kwong Yue_ was a decision of Judith Prakash J, as her Honour then was, in which she upheld the learned assistant registrar’s taxation. Her Honour reviewed the authorities pertaining to costs where both claim and counter-claim had been dismissed, each with costs, and espoused the principles laid down by the House of Lords in _Medway Oil and Storage Company, Limited v Continental Contractors, Limited_ <span class="citation">\[1929\] AC 88</span>. _Mok Kwong Yue_ at \[7\] reads:

> 7    The first case in the series of authorities that was cited to me was _Saner v Bilton_ (1879) 11 Ch D 416, the decision of a very well respected judge, Fry J. That case had a result that was similar to the one here in that the plaintiff’s claim was dismissed with costs to the defendant and the defendant’s counterclaim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff. Fry J’s decision laid down the basis for the _Medway_ principles and it was subsequently explained in _Medway Oil_ (\[1\] _supra_) by Viscount Haldane as follows:

>> In 1879 Fry J. decided _Saner v Bilton_. … The question was whether the defendant ought to pay only so much of the costs pertaining to the claim as were occasioned by the counterclaim, or whether the costs of all the proceedings which related to both claim and counterclaim should be apportioned. Fry J. consulted some of the most eminent of the Taxing Masters, who advised against apportionment. He afterwards gave a considered judgment, in which he said that analysis of the practice before the Judicature Act threw but little light on the question before him. _The true view seemed to him to be that the plaintiff having begun the litigation, and the counterclaim having only arisen in it as a consequence, the claim should be treated as if it stood by itself, and the counterclaim should bear only the amount by which the costs of the proceedings had been increased by it._ Special directions might be given by the Court which would vary the application of the rule, but in a case where both claim and counterclaim were simply dismissed with costs, there should be no apportionment, and no question of quantum arose. \[emphasis added\]

7       In _Mok Kwong Yue_, the plaintiff sought a review of the taxation of his costs of defeating the counter-claim. He sought $80,000 but was only allowed $7,000. Prakash J, in applying the said principles relating to costs, found that much of the defence related to the claim itself (and thus would have been the defendant’s costs). Only one element of the defence related to the counter-claim and was “marginal” so far as costs were concerned.

8       The plaintiff submits (at \[3\] above) that the defendant’s counter-claim for payment of its progress claims goes beyond its defence.

9       The defendant relies on O59 r3(2) of the Rules of Court which provides for costs to follow the event “except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs.” It says that I should order costs in favour of the defendant “based on the circumstances of the case”. The defendant seeks $40,000 fixed costs and $5,000 fixed disbursements (without a detailed break-down of the disbursements). O59 r3(2) reads:

> (2)    If the Court in the exercise of its discretion sees fit to make any order as to the costs of and incidental to any proceedings, the Court shall, subject to this Order, order the costs to follow the event, except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs.

10     In the present case, I have to decide whether, on balance, to fix costs in favour of either party or whether I should order each party to bear its own costs. The authorities are relevant and I need to apply these principles in making my decision.

11     The latter position at \[10\], _ie_, that each party should bear its own costs, is the plaintiff’s submission. With respect, this would only be right if I am of the view that the issues raised in the claim/defence, on the one hand, and the distinct and additional issues raised in the counter-claim/defence to the counter-claim, on the other hand, are such as to cancel each other out, as a matter of apportionment (at \[4\] above).

12     The former position at \[10\], which is the defendant’s submission, would be correct if either its counter-claim comprised only its defence or else, that as a matter of apportionment, there is a balance in costs in its favour.

13     The plaintiff’s claim was for damages arising from the defendant’s breach of contract including costs for excavation which the defendant allegedly failed to do and alleged costs of completing works that the defendant failed to complete, by the deployment of the plaintiff’s own manpower and the hire of other contractors. The defendant’s defence was that excavation was not its job and the plaintiff’s alleged costs were not incurred.

14     The defendant’s counter-claim was for the plaintiff’s failing to pay the progress claims which the defendant had submitted but which the plaintiff did not certify. The plaintiff’s defence to the counter-claim was that it was not due and payable because certification was a pre-condition to payment and the defendant’s progress claims were inflated in terms of the work in fact completed and the rate claimed which exceeded the “market rate”.

15     In the result that I came too in the principal decision, the defendant succeeded in its defence but failed in its counter-claim. As might be seen from \[13\] and \[14\], the defendant’s uncertified progress claims, on which it failed, did raise an issue distinct from and additional to its defence on which it succeeded.

16     Hence, in deciding who, if anyone, should have the fixed costs of the action, and how much, I think that I should look at the question of how much costs might have been ordered if the case proceeded on the basis of only either party’s claim.

17     The plaintiff’s claim for damages was $146,863.94. The defendant’s counter-claim for work done was for $149,621.15.

18     Based on the internal costs guidelines of the State Courts, I take into account several factors in the exercise: the claim quanta, complexity of the claim, and where a matter is resolved post-trial, the number of days of trial.

19     In respect of the plaintiff’s claim, I consider it factually complex. On the other hand, the defendant’s counter-claim was of a simple order, given _inter alia_ the absence of certification and the correspondingly _ipse dixit_ character of the progress claims in question. The trial occupied four days, of which I would attribute a day to the counter-claim and three to the claim.

20     With those criteria in mind, the costs of the plaintiff’s claim would have been $16,000 for the first day and $4,000 for each of the balance two days, _ie_, $24,000. The defendant’s counter-claim would have incurred $10,000 costs for one day.

21     Since the cost considerations are such, the costs on both sides do not cancel each other out. It would not be right to order each party to bear its own costs.

22     Instead, applying the _Medway_ principles, if this matter had involved a taxation of the plaintiff’s costs of defeating the defendant’s counter-claim, this would be a matter for apportionment of the costs attributable respectively to the claim and counter-claim. Doing this, and taking $10,000 off $24,000, I obtain $14,000 in the defendant’s favour. In other words, in the hypothetical taxation, the plaintiff would in fact have a deficit.

23     My decision concerning the costs of the claim and the counter-claim is thus that the plaintiff shall pay the defendant’s costs fixed at $14,000. As for disbursements, the defendant has given no break-down or basis for the amount of $5,000. More likely than not, the defendant’s disbursements pertained as much to the counter-claim as they did to the claim. Hence, there would be no order concerning disbursements.

24     By reference to O59 r3(2), my decision in \[23\] might be characterised as not one where costs follow the event but an application of the exception thereunder owing to the circumstances of the case, _ie_, I am making an order fixing costs overall for both the claim and the counter-claim with a nett quantum in favour of the defendant.
