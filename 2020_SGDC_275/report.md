### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused committed Robbery on 14 August 2019, an offence under Section 392 the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). He pleaded guilty and was convicted of the charge in DAC 923357 of 2019. He admitted to the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) in support of the Charge. He also admitted to one charge of driving without a licence under Section 35(2) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) and another charge of not having the requisite insurance under Section 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed). The Accused gave his consent for these two charges to be taken into consideration for sentence. The Accused was sentenced to three years and three months of imprisonment and the mandatory minimum caning of six strokes.

2       The Accused has filed an appeal against the sentence. He is currently serving his sentence which was backdated to take effect from 3 February 2020.

## Charge

3       The Charge in DAC 923357 of 2019 reads as follows:

>     “You, M Jegatheesh (Male, 27 years old, DOB: 22 January 1992), are charged that, sometime on 13 August 2019 in Singapore, did engage with one Veeramani s/o Subran Das in a conspiracy to rob Hock Cheong Jade and Jewellery (“Hock Cheong”) located at Blk 574 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 #01-1835, Singapore 560574, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on the 14th day of August 2019, between 3.50 p.m. and 4.19 p.m at Hock Cheong, _to wit_, you committed robbery of jewelleries worth $119,288, in the possession of one Ling Hew Kwong and Leng Yew Weng, and whilst committing the robbery, voluntarily caused fear of instant hurt to the said Ling Hew Kwong and Leng Yew Weng, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 392 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

## Statement of Facts

4       The following is a summary of the relevant facts in the **SOF** pertaining to the charge in DAC 923357 of 2019.

5       The victims were Ling Hew Kwong (“LHK”), male 70 years old, and his elder brother Leng Yew Weng (“LYW”), male 75 years old. Both of them are the owners of Hock Cheong Jade & Jewellery shop (“the shop”).

6       The accomplice is Veeramani S/O Subran Das (male 37 years old) and he was working as a Grab Driver and owned a white Toyota Vellfire SKF3755Z (the “Toyota”) at the time of the offence.

7       The informant was Lim Lay Khim. On 14 August 2019 at about 4.09pm, she called “999”, stating “There is suspect robbery. I saw Uncle shouting. Can you send someone down?” The location provided was the shop located at Blk 574 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 #01-1835, Singapore 506574.

8       On 13 August 2019 at about 9pm, the Accused, Veeramani, and one Sharavindran met at Geylang Lorong 20. The Accused informed Veeramani that he intended to rob the shop the following afternoon. The Accused had targeted this shop as the shop looked old and he thought that the shop would not have any alarms installed. Further, the Accused was aware that the owners, LHK and LYW, were of advanced age. The Accused asked Veeramani to play the role of the getaway driver and to ferry the gold to Sharavindran. The Accused informed Veeramani that he would be paid for his role. The Accused further asked Sharavindran to help with the sale of the gold. Sharavindran was non-committal at that point in time.

9       On 14 August 2019 at about 2.40pm, Veeramani drove the Toyota into the carpark of Blk 521 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 and parked there. At about 2.53pm, the Accused drove the Honda into the same carpark, and parked next to the Toyota. Veeramani then entered the Honda and sat in the driver’s seat, while the Accused moved to the Honda’s rear passenger seat. The Accused then dressed in a long-sleeved blue shirt, a black hoodie, black pants, black shoes, black gloves, and a black helmet.

10     The Accused instructed Veeramani that 5 minutes after he exited from the Honda, Veeramani was to drive to the carpark of Blk 565 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. Veeramani would wait there for the Accused to commit the robbery, arrive at the said carpark, and board the Honda. After conveying these instructions, the Accused exited from the Honda at about 3.50pm while carrying a black duffel bag and began walking to the shop.

11     The Accused had chosen the carpark at Blk 521 as it did not have an electronic gantry and it would therefore be harder to track the cars that were used by the Accused and Veeramani to commit the robbery. The Accused reached the shop at about 4.07pm. LHK and LYW were sitting within the store. The Accused entered the shop and attempted to pull down the roller shutter at the entrance of the shop. However, the roller shutter became stuck midway and the Accused gave up trying to pull the shutter down. He then shouted at the victims: “Don’t move, don’t talk!” and jumped over the jewellery display counter. At this point, LHK and LYW pressed the pre-installed hidden alarm buttons to notify an external security company that the shop was being robbed.

12     The Accused noticed that the keys for the jewellery display cabinets were hanging behind the cabinet doors. He took the keys and unlocked the flaps and swept the jewellery of gold necklaces, bracelets and pendants into his duffel bag.

13     While the Accused was robbing the shop, LHK told the Accused in Malay: “Tolong, tolong, kedai kecik, cukup lah”, which he meant as telling the Accused not to take so much jewellery as he had a small shop. LHK also shouted “Tolong Tolong” in Malay, which meant “help” in English. The victims did not confront the Accused as he was much bigger than them and they were of advanced age. The feared that they would be hurt if they resisted.

14     LHK’s shouts for help attracted the attention of the informant and one Teo Heng Seng (“Teo”), who was occupying a unit next to the shop. Both of them realized that the shop was being robbed. Alarmed, the informant called the Police immediately. Both the informant and Teo did not confront the Accused as they were fearful that the Accused would hurt them.

15     Once the Accused had filled the duffel bag with jewellery, he jumped over the counter and fled towards Blk 558 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10. The Accused had taken jewellery valued at $119,288.

16     While waiting for the Accused, Veeramani drove the Honda out from the carpark of Blk 521 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 at about 3.57pm. He then drove to the car park of Blk 565 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 and entered it at 4.02pm. At that point, Sharavindran called Veeramani, who then realised that he was at the incorrect carpark, and he drove to the carpark of Blk 558 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 instead, to wait for the Accused.

17     The Accused then entered the carpark of Blk 558 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 at about 4.15pm. He boarded the Honda and changed out of the clothing used during the robbery. He placed the used clothing inside the same duffel bag used to contain the gold jewellery. He then drove out of the carpark at 4.20pm, returning to the carpark of Blk 521 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. Veeramani then placed the duffel bag inside the Toyota and entered the Toyota’s driver seat. The Accused instructed Veeramani to drive the Toyota away and await further instructions. Veeramani did so, and the Accused drove the Honda away.

18     Swift police follow-up actions led to the arrest of the Accused and his accomplice and all the jewellery items were recovered.

## Antecedents

19     The Accused did not have any previous convictions of note. He was placed on Probation for the offence of Theft-in-dwelling in 2011 when he was 19 years old. I gave no weight to this antecedent since he had completed the Probation and the offence was committed when he was relatively young.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

20     The Prosecution submitted that the dominant sentencing principles in this case are general deterrence and retribution. The DPP suggested a sentence of imprisonment of at least three and a half years and the mandatory minimum six strokes of the cane and put forth the following factors in support:

> (a)     The Accused was the mastermind in a daring daylight robbery.

> (b)     The offence was highly premeditated and elaborately planned.

> (c)     The robbery was committed against elderly victims and the offence had caused public alarm.

> (d)     The accomplice Veeramani, who had pleaded guilty earlier, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the same offence.

> (e)     The jewellery items robbed were of a significant value amounting to more than one hundred thousand dollars in total.

21     The Prosecution tendered sentencing precedents to show the range of sentences imposed for robbery offences. The DPP was mindful that these precedents had aggravating factors absent from the present case.

### Mitigation plea

22     The Accused was unrepresented. He pleaded for leniency and highlighted that he did not carry any weapon during the robbery. He had helped the police to recover the items.

## Sentence

### The Reasons for the Sentence

23     The offence of Robbery under Section 392 of the Penal Code, committed during the day (before 7pm), is punishable with a mandatory minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The maximum imprisonment term is ten years. Since only the mandatory minimum six strokes of the cane were ordered, the following will only deal with the reasons for the calibration of the length of imprisonment imposed.

24     The calibration of the appropriate sentence must take into account the harm caused and the offender’s culpability that is based on the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the relevant sentencing factors.

25     In the present case, the following sentencing factors were considered:

> (a)     The offence of robbery is a very serious offence.

> (b)     The items and amount involved is $119,288 worth of jewellery.

> (c)     The full recovery of the items.

> (d)     The role of the Accused in the planning and carrying out of the robbery.

26     Based on the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution, it was reasonable for the DPP to suggest three years and six months as the sentence for this offence of robbery, bearing in mind that the offence of robbery by day is punishable up to ten years of imprisonment. In my view, the sentence for this case cannot be the mandatory minimum of two years as that is more appropriate for a robbery of a small amount which did not involve vulnerable elderly victims and not premeditated and planned.

27     In the present case, the Accused had it all worked out, from targeting a gold shop manned by two elderly men of more than 70 years old, choosing of the carpark without an electronic gantry, coming up with the escape route, the recruiting of accomplice Veeramani to drive the cars and Sharavindran to dispose of the loot. The commission of the offence was well-planned, carefully coordinated and boldly executed.

28     I decided to give the Accused a sentence lower by three months than what the Prosecution had submitted because I had found the suggested uplift by the DPP for the offence to be on the high side, bearing in mind the sentences handed out in precedent cases which were more serious. I had also given more mitigatory weight to the full recovery of all the items, in view of the uncontradicted claim by the Accused in his oral mitigation that he and Veeramani had helped the police to recover the items.

29     The Accused asked for a lower sentence on the basis that he had not used any weapon during the robbery. The Accused failed to appreciate that if weapons had been used during the robbery, his sentence would have been higher by reason of such an aggravating factor.

### The Parity Principle in Sentencing

30     Where two persons have been involved in the commission of the same offence, the parity principle in sentencing requires that their sentences ought to be similar unless there are reasons for a heavier or lighter sentence in view of individual factors.

31     In the present case, the following factors differentiated the Accused from the accomplice Veeramani in the commission of this offence:

> (a)     The Accused was the mastermind of the robbery. He recruited the accomplice and planned the whole operation. He decided on the shop as the target, determined the time and directed the accomplice to be the driver of the cars to be used before and after the robbery.

> (b)     The Accused was the person who personally went into the shop, instilled fear upon the victims and physically removed the jewellery items.

32     The aforesaid facts showed the central role played by the Accused and formed the reasons for the heavier sentence of three more months for the Accused than Veeramani. Nevertheless, I had refrained from imposing more than three months to avoid any hint of unjustified disparity in the two sentences. Veeramani also did not have relevant antecedents.

33     The two remaining charges which the Accused admitted to were not given any consideration in the calibration of the sentence for the convicted charge of robbery as these were minor and usually attracted non-custodial sentences for a first offender.

## Conclusion

34     The sentence of three years and three months of imprisonment and six strokes of the cane is lower than what the Prosecution had submitted but should adequately address the sentencing objectives as presented by the facts and circumstances of this case. The significant fact is that the Accused was the mastermind as well as the perpetrator in carrying out the brazen act of robbery in broad daylight. Veeramani acted as the driver and was sentenced to imprisonment of three years and six strokes of the cane. It would be a travesty of justice if the Accused was given the same or less than the accomplice who had played a lesser role.
