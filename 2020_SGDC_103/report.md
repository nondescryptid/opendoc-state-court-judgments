Civil procedure – costs – offer to settle

22 April 2020

### District Judge Loo Ngan Chor:

1       This is my decision on costs, which is supplemental to my substantive decision reported at <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 60</span>. The parties’ dispute involved renovation works done by the plaintiff at the defendant’s apartment, with the plaintiff claiming for unpaid works and the defendant counter-claiming for, amongst other things, defective works.

2       By my principal decision, I allowed the plaintiff’s claim of $121,257.69 in the sum of $114,662.90. I allowed the defendant’s counter-claim in the sum of $17,759.60, which was a fraction of what he hoped to recover. After setting off the two sums allowed, I decided that the defendant was to pay the plaintiff the nett sum of $96,903.30 with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ.

3       In making my decision on costs, I have had regard to counsel’s respective costs submissions dated 1st April 2020.

4       The plaintiff had issued an offer to settle dated 29th December 2017 whereby the plaintiff offered to accept a sum of $93,888 “within fourteen (14) days from the defendant’s acceptance of this offer” in full settlement of both the claim and the counter-claim. Two further paragraphs provided for costs fixed at $20,000 and reasonable disbursements or indemnity costs, depending on whether the defendant’s acceptance of the offer was within or after the said 14 days.

5       This offer to settle is inferentially in no small part based on the opinion of Mr See Choo Lip, which guided me in my principal decision. He was the parties’ single joint expert whose opinion was to bind parties, except that the defendant implicitly rejected it. His report was dated 14th March 2017 and the addendum thereto was dated 18th August 2017.

6       The sum due to the plaintiff as decided by me is more favourable than the amount in the plaintiff’s offer to settle. The plaintiff is thus entitled to standard costs down to 29th December 2017 and indemnity costs afterwards unless I order otherwise in the exercise of my discretion, based on O22A r9(1) of the Rules of Court.

7       In his costs submissions, Mr Mervyn Foo has asked that I order indemnity costs from 17th June 2016. This was the date of the CDR mediation session during which the learned CDR District Judge suggested that parties appoint an expert surveyor.

8       Chan Sek Keong CJ, as his Honour then was, sitting in the High Court in _CCM Indusrial Pte Ltd_ v _Uniquetech Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 20</span>, explained the interplay of O22A r9(1) and (3), r9(5) and r12. Mr Foo referred me to this authority. CCM was an appeal from the District Court which ordered indemnity costs to be borne by the appellant when O22A r9(1) and (3) were not applicable. His Honour explained that the empowering provisions in O22A concerning costs are to be found in rr 9(1), 9(3) and 9(5) whilst r12 lays down guidelines for the exercise of the court’s discretion. See \[27\], \[44\] and \[45\] of the judgment.

9       I now cite the relevant rules which are rr 9(1), 9(5) and 12:

> **9.—(1**)    Where an offer to settle made by a plaintiff —

>> (_a_)    is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made; and

>> (_b_)    is not accepted by the defendant, and the plaintiff obtains a judgment not less favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,

> the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date an offer to settle was served and costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless the Court orders otherwise

> …

> (5)    Without prejudice to paragraphs (1), (2) and (3), where an offer to settle has been made, and notwithstanding anything in the offer to settle, the Court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent any costs are to be paid, and the Court may make such a determination upon the application of a party or of its own motion.

> …

> **Discretion of Court (O. 22A, r. 12)**

> **12**.    Without prejudice to Rules 9 and 10, the Court, in exercising its discretion with respect to costs, may take into account any offer to settle, the date the offer was made, the terms of the offer and the extent to which the plaintiff’s judgment is more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle.

10     In respect of Mr Foo’s submission, I accept that I do have the power to consider an earlier start date for the defendant to pay indemnity costs. O22A rr9(1) gives me the discretion to depart from the default position. And r9(5) too, because acceding to the submission would affect the extent of any costs to be paid by the defendant.

11     In this instance, I am of the view that it would not be appropriate here to depart from the default position set out in O22A r9(1). It was only when Mr See’s report and addendum were released that the defendant could have known what his prospects were. The plaintiff’s OTS, issued a few months afterwards, apparently drew from Mr See’s views.

12     This being the case, my decision is that the defendant shall pay the plaintiff’s costs on a standard basis from the start of the action until 29th December 2017, and on an indemnity basis from 30th December 2017.

13     The learned defendant’s counsel has submitted that I should ignore a _Calderbank_ letter dated 23rd April 2019 which was issued in response to the defendant’s _Calderbank_ letter dated 16th April 2019, days before the second tranche of the trial. Given counsel’s limited point, I accept it and shall ignore the said _Calderbank_ letter. The learned counsel did not refer to the OTS. As an aside, for my part, I also note that the said letter was not a withdrawal of the OTS in that whilst the said letter offered two slightly higher amounts to be paid by the defendant, depending on the timing of the payments, it did not mention the OTS and did not purport to withdraw it. It was also not in Form 34 (as per O22A r3(3)).

14     I now deal with the quantum of costs. First, the case was complex owing to the defendant’s conduct having made it so. Secondly, the amounts in dispute arising from the claim and the counter-claim added up to a sum of more than $210,000. Thirdly, since the hearing of the preliminary objection occupied the better part of a day during the first tranche, I would count that towards the number of trial days, giving three days in all.

15     Given these considerations, if the matter involved only standard basis costs, I would have fixed costs of $27,000 comprising $18,000 for the first day and $4500 for each additional day. If this matter had been resolved before the summons for directions which was filed on 1st December 2017, standard basis costs would have been about $10,000. Viewed in the round, I would assign $10,000 as the standard basis costs down to the date of the OTS and $17,000 as the standard basis costs after the OTS.

16     To arrive at the indemnity basis costs post-OTS, I would, as requested by Mr Foo, apply an uplift of 20%. I would apply this uplift to $17,000, which gives $20,400.

17     I thus fix the costs payable by the defendant to the plaintiff at $30,400.

18     For disbursements, I have gone through the list attached as Annex B to the plaintiff’s costs submissions, which seeks $18,860.95. Purely for expediency, since the dates of the disbursements straddled the OTS date, I have viewed the list from the point of view of the defendant as the paying party (ie, the standard basis costs approach if the matter were taxed: O59 r27(2)). I am of the view that the disbursements were reasonably incurred and should be allowed.

19     In summary, my decision is that the defendant shall pay the plaintiff costs fixed at $30,400 and disbursements fixed at $18,860.95.
