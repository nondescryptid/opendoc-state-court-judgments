Statutory interpretation – Construction of statute – Section 22 of the State Courts Act – Abandonment of excess amount in claim to give District Court jurisdiction – What constitutes abandonment

27 July 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       An interesting question of law on the jurisdiction of the District Court arose for determination in this case. The claimant in the present case chose to quantify his claim in _excess_ of the jurisdictional limit for monetary claims filed in the District Court which is currently fixed at $250,000. The Plaintiff took the view that there is no impediment in the District Court hearing and determining the claim, provided that the Court caps the award at $250,000. The Defendant took the view that the Plaintiff must cap his claim at $250,000, _before_ the Court can proceed to hear and try the claim. The answer to the contention turns on the proper interpretation of section 22 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed), which provides that a claimant can abandon the excess amount of his claim to give the District Court jurisdiction to hear and try the claim. Parties are at divergence on what constitutes an abandonment. Even though the provision is well-entrenched within our jurisprudence, local case law is surprisingly sparse. This case offers an opportunity for me to pronounce my views on this jurisdictional issue. I begin with the background facts.

## Background facts

2       Like many assessment of damages arising from motor accident claims, the background facts of this case is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial. The Plaintiff met with a motor accident involving the Defendant on 12 October 2011. The Plaintiff allegedly sustained personal injuries from the accident for which this action was commenced. Interlocutory judgment was entered in the Plaintiff’s favour against the Defendant. The matter proceeded to assessment of damages before me.

3       In his Opening Statement filed one day before the assessment hearing, the Plaintiff quantified the amount of damages claimed for both general and special damages.[^1] What is significant is that the aggregate amount of damages claimed stood at $397,551.08. This amount far exceeded the jurisdictional limit for monetary claims filed in the District Court which is currently fixed at $250,000. Upon realising this, counsel for the Defendant promptly raised a challenge as to the court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim at the assessment hearing the next day. Counsel for the Defendant informed the court that the Plaintiff should have either transferred the matter to the High Court or reduced the claim sum.[^2] Counsel for the Plaintiff, at that point in time, took the view that the court had the power to give judgment in excess of $250,000, and it was then for the Plaintiff to limit the enforcement of the judgment to $250,000.[^3] He stated that there were authorities on this.[^4] When I queried what were these authorities, counsel for the Plaintiff said he did not have any with him.[^5] In these circumstances, I directed parties to address the jurisdictional issue in their written submissions.[^6]

4       Neither party filed written submissions on this issue in the course of the assessment. The assessment therefore proceeded afoot, with evidence adduced from both sides. Closing submissions were filed after both parties closed their respective cases. In the Defendant’s closing submissions, the Defendant once again reiterated that this court lacks the jurisdiction to hear the claim. I turn now to summarise the parties’ respective arguments on this issue.

## Parties’ submissions

5       The Defendant argued that the District Court does not have jurisdiction to hear monetary claims in excess of $250,000. Pursuant to section 22 of the State Courts Act, the Plaintiff must first abandon the excess amount of the claim, before the District Court can acquire the jurisdiction to hear and try the action.[^7]

6       The Plaintiff initially failed to address the jurisdictional issue altogether in his written submissions. He went straight to address the merits of the claim, as though it was a foregone conclusion that the court had jurisdiction to determine his claim. Contrary to what was represented to the court at the hearing, no authorities were cited in support of the proposition that the court had the jurisdiction to deliver a judgment in excess of $250,000 and that the only impediment was against the Plaintiff enforcing the judgment beyond $250,000. It was only upon perusing the Defendant’s written submissions that the Plaintiff filed further submissions to address this issue.[^8] I pause here to note that the further submissions were not filed by stipulated deadline for parties to file reply submissions. Not only did the Plaintiff omit to seek an extension of time, the submissions were filed two weeks later. At the end of the deadline, the court is entitled to commence its deliberation based on the materials tendered. If the Plaintiff had wanted to file further submissions, he should have notified the court and sought leave by the deadline. As the further submissions were filed without leave, I informed parties that until and unless the Plaintiff seeks the requisite leave of court, I would assume that the Plaintiff would not be relying on those submissions.[^9] The Plaintiff subsequently filed a Summons seeking leave and leave was duly granted with costs of $500 ordered against the Plaintiff’s solicitors.[^10] I also acceded to the Defendant’s request to file submissions in response to the Plaintiff’s further submissions.

7       In his further submissions, the Plaintiff took the position that he had “implicitly abandoned” the excess amount of the claim.[^11] He argued that section 22 of the State Courts Act does not prevent the Plaintiff’s claim from being heard and tried, by the sole reason that it may exceed $250,000.

8       In the Defendant’s reply submissions, the Defendant rejected the concept of “implicit abandonment”. Referring to foreign case law, the Defendant argued that the word “abandon” envisages a positive act on the Plaintiff’s part to disavow the excess amount of the claim, and that such abandonment must take place before the court proceeds to hear and try the case.[^12]

## Discussion

9       It is undisputed that the District Court’s jurisdiction allows it to hear monetary claims up to the value of $250,000. A claim in excess of this sum should be filed in the High Court, unless the claim falls within one of the exceptions prescribed in the State Courts Act. In the present case, the Plaintiff seeks to invoke section 22 to confer this court with the relevant jurisdiction to hear the claim.

10     Section 22 of the State Courts Act reads as follows:

>      **Abandonment of part of claim to give District Court jurisdiction**

> **22.**—(1)    Where the amount claimed in an action exceeds the District Court limit, or any remedy or relief sought in an action is in respect of a subject-matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit, and a District Court would have jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action if the amount or value, as the case may be, did not exceed the District Court limit, the plaintiff may abandon the excess amount or that remedy or relief, as the case may be, and thereupon a District Court shall have jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action, provided that the plaintiff —

>> (a)    shall not recover in the action an amount exceeding the District Court limit; and

>> (b)    shall not obtain in the action any remedy or relief in respect of a subject-matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit.

> (2)    Where a District Court has jurisdiction to hear and try an action by virtue of this section, the judgment of the court in the action shall be in full discharge of all demands in respect of the cause of action.

11     As is evident from the title and the express wording of the provision, a claimant can abandon the excess amount of a claim to give the District Court jurisdiction to hear and try a claim. It is clear to me that a claimant must first abandon the excess of the claim, _before_ the court can proceed to hear and try the action. The ordinary meaning of the word “thereupon” is “immediately after something that is mentioned” (Cambridge Dictionary <https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/thereupon> (last accessed on 26 July 2021)). The insertion of this word between the phrases “the plaintiff may abandon the excess amount” and “a District Court shall have jurisdiction” signals Parliament’s intent for the former to take place before the latter can take effect.

12     What then constitutes an “abandonment”? The Plaintiff argued that the act of pursuing a claim in excess of $250,000 in the District Court implies that he intended to abandon the excess amount, since $250,000 is the maximum amount recoverable under the District Court jurisdiction. In support of this argument, the Plaintiff cited the case of _Corwin Holding Pte Ltd v Dragon’s Nail, Foot & Body Massage Place Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 108</span> (“_Corwin_”), where DJ Loo Ngan Chor made the following observations on section 22:

> 18     _On its plain meaning, s22 does not require that the plaintiff expressly abandons the excess above the jurisdictional limit of the District Court._ Unlike s23, s22 does not require writing. Unlike s54B, s22 does not require an application. Comparison with the wording in ss54C and 54E might also be made; these two sections, which have to do with transfers from the High Court to the lower courts and counter-claims in the lower courts exceeding the jurisdictional limit, speak of applications to the High Court or of the High Court acting on its own motion. On the face of the Statement of Claim, even given the liquidated character of the claim, it was not apparent from the record that the claim overall would exceed the limit. _If the plaintiff desired its full pound of flesh, one would have expected the plaintiff to have made application for the matter to be transferred to the High Court for trial. Given these considerations, the plaintiff must be taken to have impliedly or implicitly abandoned the excess pursuant to the operation of s22._ It was too late to disinter the issue in its closing submissions.

>     \[emphasis added\]

13     I take the view that the passage above does not represent the _ratio_ of _Corwin_. _Corwin_ concerned the plaintiff’s request to transfer proceedings to the High Court. The plaintiff contended that the damages, if properly computed, would have brought the claim beyond $250,000, and accordingly in its closing submissions sought a transfer of the assessment of damages to the High Court. DJ Loo dismissed the request for abuse of process. He observed that the power to transfer the proceedings resided in the High Court and not the District Court (at \[14\]). While he went on to discuss other matters such as section 22, the request strictly speaking could have been dismissed on this ground alone. In these circumstances, the passage cited above concerning s 22 of the State Courts Act was _obiter dicta_, which is not binding on this court. Accordingly, I am at liberty to arrive at an independent view on this issue.

14     The Plaintiff submits that _Corwin_ stands for the proposition that the claimant suing in excess of $250,000 in the District Court would have _implicitly_ abandoned the amount in excess of $250,000, so as to give the District Court the jurisdiction to hear and determine the case and award judgment up to $250,000. To the extent that _Corwin_ stands for this proposition, I am respectfully unable to agree. This proposition contradicts the express wording of the provision. The word “abandon” signals a positive course of action. The mere act of suing sums in excess of $250,000 in the District Court does not constitute an abandonment of the amount in excess of that. If that were the case, there would have been no need for the draftsman to expressly impose an obligation on the claimant to abandon the excess amount. If the Plaintiff were correct, every claimant would have a _de facto_ right to bring a claim of any amount in the District Court, and a District Court would have the jurisdiction to hear all claims, regardless of its monetary value. No abandonment on the claimant’s part would be required. Instead, the obligation would have been on the _District Court_ to hive off the excess amount and deliver a judgment no more than $250,000. The Plaintiff’s contention would result in differently worded section 22. For instance, the following deletions (in strikethrough) and additions (in underline) would have to be made:

>      **~Abandonment of part of claim to give District Court jurisdiction~**

>      **District Court must reduce part of claim in excess of the District Court limit**

> **22.**—(1)    Where the amount claimed in an action exceeds the District Court limit, or any remedy or relief sought in an action is in respect of a subject-matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit, and a District Court would have jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action if the amount or value, as the case may be, did not exceed the District Court limit, ~the plaintiff may abandon the excess amount or that remedy or relief, as the case may be, and thereupon~ a District Court shall have jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action, provided that the plaintiff —

>> (a)    shall not recover in the action an amount exceeding the District Court limit; and

>> (b)    shall not obtain in the action any remedy or relief in respect of a subject-matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit.

> (2)    Where a District Court has jurisdiction to hear and try an action by virtue of this section, the judgment of the court in the action shall be in full discharge of all demands in respect of the cause of action.

15     But that is not how the provision is worded. The Plaintiff’s interpretation runs contrary to the phrase “_the plaintiff may abandon the excess amount …_” and would effectively require this court to re-write the provision. That function resides with Parliament; the court’s task is to interpret the provision.

16     In my judgment, the draftsman’s decision to impose the duty on the claimant – and not the court – to hive off the excess amount of the claim was made for good reason. While neither party cited extrinsic materials on this, in my view requiring the court to bear that responsibility would place the court in a rather invidious position. Where an action comprises multiple heads of claim of different amounts, and the judgment sum exceeds $250,000, how is the court supposed to decide which heads of claim to hive off in order to meet the requisite amount of $250,000? Is the court’s decision to hive off one head of claim but not the others appealable, and if so on what grounds? To further complicate matters, not all claims are homogeneous. For instance, in the present case, the claim comprises both general and special damages. It is trite that general and special damages attract different rates of pre-judgment interest (_Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> at \[151\]). Hiving off the award for one type of claim as opposed to others would evidently have a knock-on effect on the amount of interest recoverable on the judgment sum. There may also be cost implications, as costs could be assessed separately for each discrete head of claim, having regard to the judgment sum awarded for each head of claim. In my view, it is therefore entirely logical and sensible for the draftsman to require the claimant to circumscribe his claim within the monetary limit, before the court proceeds to hear and try the claim. One may argue that these difficulties may be avoided in homogeneous claims, but that is not a relevant consideration under section 22. The provision also does not require the court to speculate as to whether the judgment sum would fall below $250,000 in which case these difficulties may be avoided. The provision operates as a bright-line rule, imposing on the claimant the obligation to reduce the claim sum to $250,000, in order to confer the court the jurisdiction to hear and try the claim.

17     Aside from the plain meaning of the provision and the logical force behind that interpretation, I have also considered English case authorities predating the enactment of the provision. It would appear from _Corwin_ that DJ Loo did not have the benefit considering foreign case law on this issue as I did. The Defendant cited foreign cases which stood for the proposition that the mere fact that part of the claim falls within the jurisdictional limit of the court does not give rise to an abandonment of the excess amount. I will discuss two of them.

18      _Vines v Arnold_ (1849) 13 JP 795 is one of the cases cited. The plaintiff in this case sued the defendant for 17 and 21 pounds in respect of two parcels of flour in the English county court, which at that time had the jurisdiction to award sums up to 20 pounds. At the hearing, the plaintiff failed to appear. The defendant admitted to the cause of action and the court pronounced judgment for 17 pounds. The plaintiff then brought another action against the same defendant for the second demand in the sum of 21 pounds in a higher court. The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff had abandoned the excess of his demand beyond 17 pounds. The court held that there was no abandonment on the plaintiff’s part, as “there must be something done by the plaintiff to constitute an abandonment”.

19      _Vines v Arnold_ was cited in a later decision of _Isaac v Wyld_ (1851) 16 JP 186 to stand for the proposition that “the mere fact of suing for a portion of an entire demand is not an abandonment of the excess, but that some act of abandonment in the court is necessary”. In _Isaac v Wyld_, the plaintiff sued for a debt of 50 pounds but at trial it turned out that the plaintiff’s entire claim was in excess of 98 pounds. The court required the plaintiff to abandon the excess above 50 pounds – which was then the jurisdictional limit of monetary claims filed in the English county court – and the plaintiff duly complied. The relevant legislative provisions provided that:

>     It shall not be lawful for any plaintiff to divide any cause of action for the purpose of bringing two or more suits in any of the said courts; but any plaintiff having cause of action for more than \[50 pounds\] for which a plaint might be entered under this act if not for more than \[50 pounds\], may abandon the excess, and thereupon the plaintiff shall, on proving his case, recover to an amount not exceeding \[50 pounds\].

20     The defendant objected to the abandonment and filed an appeal. The appellate court held that the judge had the power to record the abandonment at the hearing, explaining that the provision, although equivocal, seems to intimate that the abandonment may take place “on or before the hearing”. As the plaintiff had made a formal abandonment of the excess demand at the hearing, the appellate court found that the judge in the county court did have the jurisdiction to give judgment in the sum of 50 pounds.

21     While neither of these two English cases have been discussed in local cases, the holding is nevertheless significant, given that these cases have not been overturned and remain good law today. The abovementioned statute was later on enacted as section 42(1) of the UK County Court Act 1934 which reads (see _Legon v Count_ \[1945\] 1 All ER 710 at 712):

>     Where a plaintiff has a cause of action for more than two hundred pounds in which, if it were not for more than two hundred pounds, a county court would have jurisdiction, the plaintiff may abandon the excess, and thereupon a county could shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the action.

22     The modern equivalent of the jurisdictional provision is found in section 17 of the UK County Courts Act 1984 which reads:

> 17    Abandonment of part of claim to give court jurisdiction

> (1)    Where a plaintiff has a cause of action for more than the county court limit in which, if it were not for more than the county court limit a county court would have jurisdiction, the plaintiff may abandon the excess, and thereupon a county court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the action, but the plaintiff shall not recover in the action an amount exceeding the county court limit.

> (2)    Where the court has jurisdiction to hear and determine an action by virtue of this section, the judgment of the court in the action shall be in full discharge of all demands in respect of the cause of action, and entry of the judgment shall be made accordingly.

23     Both these provisions are substantially similar to section 22 of the State Courts Act. Given the similarity in wording, it seems to me that section 22 of the State Courts Act was modelled after section 17 of the UK County Courts Act 1984 and/or its predecessors. In deciding to model section 22 after its English counterpart, the Singapore draftsman is presumed to have considered the relevant English case law, which would include _Vines v Arnold_ and _Isaac v Wyld_. To quote Lord Reid in _London Corporation v Cusack-Smith and others_ <span class="citation">\[1955\] AC 337</span> at 361, “where Parliament has continued to use words of which the meaning has been settled by decisions of the court, it is to be presumed that Parliament intends the words to continue to have that meaning”.

24     Based on its plain meaning, logic and precedent, I find it inconceivable that Parliament would have intended the mere commencement of an action in the District Courts to constitute an “abandonment” within the meaning of section 22 of the State Courts Act. In my judgment, abandonment requires an express act of the claimant. That express act could come in the form of the claimant amending his Statement of Claim (and/or the Opening Statement in this case).

25     As to the timing of the abandonment, the phrase “thereupon … to hear and try the action” suggests that the abandonment should take place before or at the hearing or trial. I need not make a definitive ruling on this given my finding that there was no abandonment in this case.

26     In summary, the Plaintiff did not unequivocally abandon the excess amount of his claim before or at the hearing. Even if there were an intention to abandon the excess, he did not identify which portions of his claim he wishes to abandon. While the Plaintiff’s claim may well be meritorious, his refusal to abandon the excess amount means that this court had no jurisdiction to hear and try the claim. The fact that parties have entered interlocutory judgment and led evidence in this action does not cure this jurisdictional defect, as jurisdictional defects are not capable of being waived by parties (see _Arunachalam Balasubramanian v Lion City Rentals Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 33</span> at \[16\], citing _Rank Xerox (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Ultra Marketing Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 2 SLR(R) 912</span> at \[10\] and _Wilkinson v Barking Corporatio_n <span class="citation">\[1948\] 1 KB 721</span> at 725). Once the court discovers it lacks jurisdiction, it should disclaim jurisdiction.

## Conclusion

27     For these reasons, I make no order on the claim and will hear parties on costs.
