22 July 2019

### District Judge Sarah Tan:

1       This case arose out of an incident on 6 December 2014 at 35 Lorong 4, Geylang Road (“Premises”): in the wee hours of the morning, a fire broke out, claiming the lives of 4 persons.

2       Prosecution was initiated by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) for offences under the Planning Act and the Fire Safety Act. The following persons were charged:

3       The 3 Accused claimed trial. Chiang was represented, while Ong and Khah were unrepresented.

## VERDICT AND SENTENCE

4       After the joint trial, I found them guilty of their respective charges.

5       I sentenced the 3 Accused as follows:

6       Chiang and Khah have started serving their sentences. Ong has appealed against (only) sentence.

## FINDINGS AT TRIAL

7       It was undisputed that on 6 December 2014, in the wee hours of the morning, a fire broke out at the Premises. 4 persons died as a result of the fire. The Premises were owned by Chiang and tenanted to Khah at material time.

8       At the end of the trial, I found that:

> (a)     The Premises were designated for “residential” use.

> (b)     There was a material change of use: the Premises were used, not for “residential” use, but as a “workers’ dormitory”.

> (c)     Fire safety works were carried out.

> (d)     There were no applications made and no approvals obtained.

> (e)     The involvement of the Accused rendered them liable for their respective charges.

9       I will now proceed to elaborate on my findings.

## (A)    THE PREMISES WERE DESIGNATED FOR “RESIDENTIAL” USE

10     PW1, Claudia Chim Chai Yong, an executive planner attached to the Development Control Group of the URA, placed before the Court, a floor plan which she retrieved from URA’s records, with the Premises marked out in red. [^1]

11     PW1 testified that the annotations showed that the Premises was a residential flat unit. [^2]

12     PW1 further pointed out that Exhibit P2, a more detailed floor plan with the Premises outlined in red, showed a typical layout of a residential dwelling unit because it had a hall, a living area, bedrooms and a kitchen. [^3]

13     PW1 further testified that the Premises was zoned for “residential purpose” in the 1958 Master Plan. [^4] She highlighted that in fact, the nearby units (No. 33, 37, 39, 41 and 43 Lorong 4, Geylang Road) had similar layouts and uses annotated, and all were approved for residential flat dwelling purpose. [^5]

14     PW1 thus testified that a workers’ dormitory was therefore not a compatible use of the Premises, given that the Premises were a residential one and the Premises were immediately or near to residential areas: there would be a concern of “amenity issue such as noise, and other social issues and problems associated with a workers’ dormitory use in a residential area. [^6]

15     PW1 shared that a previous application to convert (the nearby) No 41A Lorong 4, Geylang Road, to proposed workers’ quarters in 1998 was rejected, on grounds that “the proposed workers’ dormitory \[was\] not in line with the land use intention for the site, which \[was\] residential/institutional”. [^7]

16     I was satisfied that the Premises were designated for “residential” use.

## (B)    THERE WAS A MATERIAL CHANGE OF USE: THE PREMISES WERE USED, NOT FOR “RESIDENTIAL” USE, BUT AS A “WORKERS’ DORMITORY”

## (I)    The State Of The Premises At Material Time: Physical

17     The following 2 witnesses were involved in the aftermath of the present fire:

> (a)     PW3, Major Yazeed Bin Abdul Rahman, attached to SCDF’s Fire Investigation Unit at material time; and

> (b)     PW5, Captain Neo Jin Xiang, attached to SCDF’s Central Enforcement Department at material time.

18     PW3 was the Lead Fire Investigator and with his team, was responsible for preparing Exhibit P7, a series of sketch plans and photographs setting out their observations and documenting the state of the Premises after the present fire.

19     Both PW3 and PW5 noted the partitioning of the Premises:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.12%"> <col width="33.54%"> <col width="33.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">PW3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">PW5</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Many partitions and “carve-outs”</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“...room 7 is, previously, could have been a kitchen” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“open area…there’s actually three room---four rooms altogether that is noted as room 3, room 4, room 5 and room 6 that’s being erected” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“…hall is just an open path, then the open area…[now] there are partitions right here” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“I made a comparison with the URA original plans.

20     It was also not disputed by Khah and Ong, that the Premises were partitioned into 10 rooms at material time. [^17]

## (II)    The State Of The Premises At Material Time: Tenants / Occupants

21     The report of PW8 Lee Ming Wei Mervyn set out the full extent of the occupancy at the Premises, a list of 24 names. He testified that the occupants were groups unrelated to each other, distinct groups of:

> (a)     husband-and-wife pair(s) (e.g. Room 3’s Ding Xiuqin and Zu Ying Hai);

> (b)     boyfriend-and-girlfriend pair(s) (e.g. Room 10’s Main Uddin Abdul Hashem and Ragas Felera Road);

> (c)     co-workers (e.g. Room 2’s Ramu A/L Kotiah and Maslan Bin Musundo); and

> (d)     solo occupants (e.g. Room 8’s Siow Kun Seng).

22     The occupants were also of different professions (e.g. cleaner, construction worker, food stall helper) and of different employers.

23     The Coroner’s Report also reported on the number of occupants at the Premises. [^18]

24     Chiang stated in his Statement dated 6 December 2014 [^19] that “the partitions of the rooms were as such which means 9 rooms in total” and he “saw many foreign workers stayed there \[sic\]”.

25     Khah was also aware of the number of foreign workers housed at the Premises. In his statement dated 16 January 2015, he gave an account of the occupants at the Premises. [^20]

26     In his statement dated 16 January 2015, Ong, indicated that “of the 7 small rooms and 2 big rooms in the unit, \[he had\] found 8 persons to stay in the 5 small rooms and 6 persons each for the 2 big rooms” and the “rental amount is SGD $600 per small room per month and SGD $1500 per big room per month”. [^21]

## (III)    “Residential” versus “Workers’ Dormitory”

27     The Planning Act itself did not define what constituted a “material change in the use of any building or land”.

28     PW2, Chng Chee Yong, a Senior Planner with the Development Control Group of URA, testified as to what amounted to “workers’ dormitory”.

29     He referred to Exhibit P5, URA Development Control Parameters for Non-residential Development (“Handbook”), at page 115:

> “…residential premises shall be deemed to be a workers’ dormitory if the total number of workers staying in the residential premises exceed 8 workers.” [^22]

30     He further testified that such workers would be those “unrelated by blood, marriage, adoption or legal guardianship”. [^23]

31     He confirmed that such information found in the Handbook would have been the same as at December 2014, the time of the subject fire.

32     He noted from information provided by the police that at the time of the subject fire, the Premises had 22 occupants, unrelated by blood, marriage, adoption or legal guardianship. When referred to Exhibit P2, he was of the view that it “\[appeared\] to be a dormitory with separate rooms, no communal living facilities”. [^24]

33     He reiterated that if the Premises were leased to more than 8 persons to convert to workers’ dormitory, then an application would have to be made because a change of use from residential to workers’ dormitory was constituted. [^25]

34     The Handbook was published under the authority of the Competent Authority. These control parameters were also published in the URA website to assist landlords and tenants to determine what constituted material change in use for which approval was required. [^26]

35     The Prosecution argued that what constituted a material change was a matter within the province of the Competent Authority, a position in line with UK case law, where likewise the term “material change in the use” was not defined in legislation. [^27]

36     Under paragraph 1 of the Appointment of Competent Authority (Cap 232, N7), the Chief Executive Officer of URA would be the Competent Authority “responsible for the operation of the provisions of the Planning Act”. The Handbook was published pursuant to such mandate. [^28]

37     The cap of 8 persons, in excess of which premises would be deemed a “workers’ dormitory”, was something which was even considered in Parliament. As recently as 2017, during the Second reading of the Planning (Amendment) Bill (Bill No. 3 of 217) (Singapore Parliamentary Debates Official Report (6 February 2017) Vol94), the Minister for National Development, Mr Lawrence Wong, had made reference to the increase of the cap of 6 persons to 8 persons in 2008, and the subsequent need to revert to the cap of 6 persons at the time of the Bill. [^29]

38     I was therefore satisfied that the Premises were indeed used as a “workers’ dormitory” at the time of the offences, and for this material change of use, permission would have to be obtained.

## (C)    FIRE SAFETY WORKS WERE CARRIED OUT

39     The Fire Safety Act defines “fire safety works” as “any fire protection works, fire safety measures, relevant pipeline works or minor works”.

40     In turn, “minor works” is defined as:

> (a)     The “**_addition, alteration_** or repair of a building that involves the use of **_combustible materials_** or that **_affects the means of escape or the effectiveness of fire safety measures_**”; or

> (b)     The “provision, extension or alteration of any air-conditioning service or ventilating system in or in connection with a building”.

> \[emphasis my own\]

41     Khah and Ong did not dispute that partitions were put up at the Premises. [^30]

42     The evidence of PW3 and PW5 largely corroborated each other, as to what works were done and the effect that such works had:

43     PW3 testified that:

> “Normally, walls won’t burn. So, if you have a **_partition that is non-concrete_** like, most likely, the **_fire could have consumed_**. So, what is you---left there is only the metal frames that’s holding the---that’s left behind from the partition.” [^44]

> \[emphasis my own\]

44     PW5 was also of the view that as only “the skeletal remains of what is supposedly a frame” were left, “the hollow space” “should be the partitions, **_consumed by the fire_**, which is non-concrete in nature.” [^45] He also went on to say of the room that lead to room 10: “You can also see some part of the boards that are missing. Most probably, it was **_consumed by the fire_**, as well.” [^46]

> \[emphasis my own\]

45     PW3 was of the view that the extent of smoke and heat damage was “extensive”:

> “Q:Based on the extent of the heat damage, how would you describe the **_intensity of the fire_**?

> A:It’s **_quite, I would say, large_**, because, as you can see from the photographs, from all these photographs, that smoke actually propagate into the respective rooms and as fire develops, combustion gases and smoke will generally, naturally, will fill up the ceiling and travel. So, as the fire progresses, naturally, you will see the **_extent of fire damage_**, it’s **_quite extensive_**.” [^47]

> \[emphasis my own\]

> “Q:How would you describe the **_level of damage_** based on \[photo 17\]?

> A:The level of damage is **_quite extensive_**. The walls, the ceilings, even the partition of room 10 is consumed by fire…

> The walls and the ceilings sustained heat and smoke damage, just to clarify, and the partition of room 10 was badly damaged as a result of the fire.” [^48]

> \[emphasis my own\]

> “Q:Let’s move on to photo 18, P7(21). What do you see in photo 18?

> A:Photo 18 actually shows the extensive spalling of concrete that was observed on the ceiling in front of door to room 10…

> Spalling of concrete normally happens when it’s subjected to entens---heat. Only then, it would crack and crumble. So, the spalling of concrete at area means to say that the **_fire is quite intense_** at the area…” [^49]

> \[emphasis my own\]

46     Indeed, No. 37 Lorong 4, Geylang Road was also effected. [^50]

47     PW3 testified that smoke build-up had occurred:

> “Q:Based on mac---your experience, what would cause the smoke to travel faster to dissipate out?

> A:The constraint for smoke is if you have---it oils---it all boils down to how much available space that it has. If you have a larger---f you have a larger volume in which the smoke can accumulate, then the smoke layer accumulation or build-up will be much more lesser as compared to **_when you have partitions or you are actually constricting or restraining the amount of available space for the smoke to actually move out_**. So, **_by having partitions or enclosed spaces per se, you are actually allowing smoke to build up_** and, hence, the build-up is---the concentration of smoke within the available space itself is quite huge as compared to a room without partition.” [^51]

> \[emphasis my own\]

48     PW3 testified:

> “Q:Okay. And how do these alterations to the premises **_affect fire safety_** in this case?

> A:Well, one, like just now I mentioned, it---having enclosed spaces actually reduce the volume in which, you know, the same could have progressed and accumulate. Thus, reducing concentration---increasing concentration. **_Having without partition is will be better because it’s now having a larger volume to fill and, you know, able to escape freely_**. The other thing with---with partition is because of combustibility of these partitions that you need to take note---

> Q:Combustibility, is it?

> A:Combustibility of this partition. You also need to take note that it may add additional fuels to the fire and---yah.” [^52]

> \[emphasis my own\]

49     PW5 also supported the position taken by PW3:

> “Q:How would space affect smoke? Or the movement of smoke?

> A:Okay, an example would be just---a large space would of course give the smoke more time and room to---to fill up. **_In such a scenario, where the partition created the narrow corridor as well as the narrow spaces, right, the smoke has less places to---to move and disperse._** So it most probably created a situation where---where smoke actually had nowhere else to disperse and there was a faster than normal smoke movement and descent in that area.” [^53]

> \[emphasis my own\]

> “Q: And how would the use of the premises, as what you have just described, affect the number of people living there?

> A: For example, a family unit living there would not have coma---compartmented \[sic\] into so many different rooms. Partitioned up to so many different rooms. And of course, the individual rooms would not have so many personal items in them as well. Yah, t**_he occupant load is definitely much larger_** than any family residential I have ever inspected…

> Q: And how would the **_number of people affect the rate at which they can escape the unit_**, in the event of an emergency?

> A: It would **_really, greatly slow them down_**. Because of the **_large number of people trying to use these limited number of exits here_**. If it was, let’s say, if we were to compare to the---if we were to have an approved dormitory, things like means of escape would have been looked ut---looked at. We have---we would have provided, say a third or even a fourth exit. Then things like fire safety measure would have also been taken in to consideration. Like adding extinguisher or even hose reels…” [^54]

> \[emphasis my own\]

50     PW6, Bryan Ng Chee Heng, a Fire Safety and Shelter Department in SCDF, observed that “it’s actually a zig zag…kind of setting, so the openings are not actually on both sides facing each other. So, it does not confirm to the requirement set forth in the Code”. [^55] The doors narrowed the width of the corridor, the addition of the door actually obstructed the means of escape. [^56]

51     PW6 testified that the addition of the partitions would be considered minor works, so required submission to SCDF [^57] and anyone could apply for the approval, including the tenant and the landlord. [^58]

52     I agreed with PW6. It was clear to me that partitions were made of material that was readily consumed by the fire and combustible.

53     The Defence for Chiang tried to argue that the partitions were not consumed by the fire but were damaged in the firefighting or removed. [^59] This contention was rebutted by PW5, who contended that if indeed the partitions were broken up or destroyed by water, pieces would have remained; and their training would have prevented such destruction.

54     The Defence for Chiang also argued that without a sample, there was little ground to contend the partitions were combustible. I was not persuaded by this argument. In fact, the very fact that little or no trace of the partitions was left after the fire bore testament to the fact that they were combustible.

55     It was also clear that me that such partitions, when added to the Premises affected the means of escape or the effectiveness of fire safety measures. The partitions created enclosed spaces leading to a build-up of noxious, asphyxiating fumes. The narrow spaces and large occupant load also affected the means of escape or the effectiveness of fire safety measures.

56     The Defence for Chiang tried to downplay the effect of the partitions, by arguing that the partitions were not full height, so smoke could flow as there would have been “air flow at top”.

57     PW5 indicated that even partial height partitions would have some adverse effect: “\[the occupants\] would have more time to react \[when\] there’s more time for the smoke to disperse if \[there had been\] no partition”. PW5 also reiterated that doors, whether opened or closed, still provided some form of obstruction, because of the larger than normal amount of people. [^60]

## (D)    THERE WERE NO APPLICATIONS MADE AND NO APPROVALS OBTAINED

58     I was satisfied that there was a material change of use of the Premises from “residential” to “workers’ dormitory”. No approval was obtained for this material change of use.

59     I was also satisfied that the erection of partitions constituted “fire safety works”, which required approval from the Commissioner of the Singapore Civil Defence Force, which approval was not obtained.

60     PW5 confirmed that in the Fire Safety Online Processing System (“FISOPS”), there were no approved plans for the Premises. [^61]

61     Indeed, none of the Accused ventured to argue that they had in fact submitted any applications for the relevant approvals. Rather, their respective Defence was to downplay their role and take the position that it was not for them to make such applications; each Accused argued instead that it ought to be either or both of the other Accused to have made the applications.

## (E)    THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE ACCUSED RENDERED THEM LIABLE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE CHARGES

62     It was not disputed that Chiang, the owner of the Premises, previously rented the Premises to Ong [^62], for the purpose of sub-letting to other tenants. Chiang was aware that Ong was renting out the rooms in the Premises to mainly foreign workers. [^63]

63     When Chiang increased the monthly rent of the Premises to $1,500, Ong asked to partition more rooms in the Premises to sustain his business and increased the number of rooms from five to nine.

64     It was also not disputed that following a raid by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority in early 2014, Chiang terminated the lease and demanded that Ong tear down the partitions and reinstate the Premises to its original condition. Sometime in July 2014, Ong engaged Khah to reinstate the Premises and Khah tore down the partitions and reinstated the Premises to its original condition.

65     Sometime in August 2014, Chiang and Khah entered into a 24-month tenancy agreement where Khah agreed to rent the Premises at a monthly rent of $2,500. Khah followed the previous layout used by Ong and erected partitions in the Premises to increase the number of rooms from five to nine again. Khah also subsequently erected partitions to create another room, thus making it a total of 10 rooms.

66     Chiang’s Defence was that he was merely a landlord and he had no knowledge of what Ong and Khah were doing, and that he was not obliged to apply for the necessary approvals.

67     Khah’s Defence essentially was that he was a mere contractor who carried out works at the Premises.

68     Ong asserted that he had no role to play in the renting of the Premises from Chiang, and the subsequent renting out to the various tenants. He asserted that he was merely a lender of monies to Khah.

69     I was satisfied that as owner and landlord of the Premises, Chiang permitted Khah to erect the partitions, for the purpose of renting out the Premises. In doing so, Chiang had also intentionally aided him in carrying out development of land outside a conservation area, causing a material change of use from “residential” to “workers’ dormitory”.

70     Chiang saw the partitions when he visited the Premises in August 2014. He also knew there were many foreign workers staying in the Premises.

71     I was also satisfied that a common intention existed between Ong and Khah to erect partitions on the Premises. Ong had also intentionally aided Khah in causing a material change of use of the Premises by providing money to rent and renovate the Premises and sourcing for workers to rent the Premises.

## (F)    INVOLVEMENT OF ONG AND KHAH

## (I)    Chiang’s version

72     Chiang and Khah signed a tenancy dated 1 August 2014 for the Premises.

73     Subsequently, Khah approached Chiang about putting up partitions after 13 August 2014; he wanted to increase the number of rooms from 5 to 9 to rent out to earn more money. [^64]

74     However, when payment was made, Chiang noted that it was with Ong’s cheques:

> “Q:Do you happen to look at the cheques to see whether it’s Mr Khah’s cheque?

> A:I took a look carefully and it was not Mr Khah’s cheque.

> Q:Whose cheque was this?

> A:It was Mr Ong’s cheques.” [^65]

> “A:When I collect \[sic\] the rent from Mr Khah, I realise \[sic\] the cheque belongs to Mr Ong. When I ask Mr Khah why the cheque belongs to Mr Ong, Mr Khah told me he don’t have money and he borrow the money from Mr Ong.” [^66]

## (II)    Khah’s version

75     Khah testified as follows:

>   
| 

“A:

 | 

…So, in the year of 20---in---in the year of 2014---2014, \[Mr Ong\] ask \[sic\] me to do the reinstate \[sic\] at the house at Lorong 4, number 35 for mis---for---to do all the reinstate \[sic\] because he need \[sic\] to hand over the shops back to the owner. To---so, during the time of doing the reinstate \[sic\], **_Mr Ong did approach me to convince the owner to let me rent the premises, so that he still can carry on running this business_**.

 |
| 

Ct:

 | 

Sorry, carry on what…business?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Carry on to do the rent---rental of the---the premises.” [^67]

 |

  
  

> \[emphasis my own\]

76     The plan was described by Khah:

> “A:So, as his contractor for a few---few years, I have---I need \[sic\] to agree with him because he did help me with many customers. Because he know \[sic\] many---many peoples \[sic\] in the markets. So I agree \[sic\] with him and **_I persuade \[sic\] the owner to rent the premises to me_**. And I told him that---I told Mr Ong that I do not have the money to run the business. **_He said that he will pack up everythings \[sic\], he will do everythings \[sic\] and he agree to---he agree \[sic\] to give me certain percent if the business is okay_**. Means that, is a **_big profit_**…After---after the reinstate \[sic\], almost the final of the reinstate \[sic\], Mr Chiang agree \[sic\] to rent the premises to me and…

> I do---I did the---I did the partitions in the premises with the support, with the materials and item by Mr Ong. And he give me---he pay \[sic\] me daily salary to make the houses, daily of $100 a day…” [^68]

> \[emphasis my own\]

77     Khah went on to say:

> “A:Because I make \[sic\] the door locks---I’m the contractor, I making \[sic\] the door and the door locks. I’m the one who hand \[sic\] him the keys. And all the---all the---all the new air cons, furnitures \[sic\], washing machines, water heaters are \[sic\] all supported by Mr Ong, in the way that he’s the backup boss. **_He paid for all the beds, the furniture, the water heater, the washing machines and the fridges._** I’m---I’m \[was\] helping him to ov---overlook \[sic\] at this premises, to look at the premises, the housekeeping. And all things in the premises, I need \[sic\] to report to him.” [^69]

> \[emphasis my own\]

78     Khah also added that besides providing financing, Ong also sourced for tenants:

> “A:As for the room 5, at the back, there is \[sic\] two Singaporeans and one couples \[sic\] staying behind. It’s **_all engaged by Mr Ong_** and I totally don’t \[sic\] know them at all…” [^70]

> \[emphasis my own\]

79     Khah tried to downplay his role:

> “A:I did---I did collect one---I did collect little bit rentals \[sic\] from the tenant as---as Mr Ong ask \[sic\] me to **_collect some from them and to pay the SP, Singapore Power_**. In other words, I’m just only the name of the premises, where I don’t do much of the operation, and **_I do---I only---my---my work in this premises is only handy---handyman and housekeeping_**.” [^71]

> \[emphasis my own\]

> “A:The term is \[sic\] he asked me to persuade the owner to rent the premises to me. And he is the one who’s running the---

> Q:Exactly.

> A:\---operation…

> Q:…Did he tell that that it was his intention to continue what he had been doing but now using you as a front?

> A:Yes, Sir...

> Q:\---that means to say, he will become in the background.

> A:Yes, Sir.” [^72]

80     Khah asserted that he was just a handyman:

> “Q:Right, so during the reinstatement works, you and Mr Ong had this discussion and then he expressed his desire for you to become---to ask the—Mr Chiang to make you the tenant and he will become the guy---the man behind you?

> A:Yes.

> Q:Right? Now, did you agree to do this?

> A:Yes…

> A:\---you see, if I take \[sic\] over this premises, I still got a salary by pay if---he will give me a certain small percent by maintaining the houses. Housekeeping and handy jobs.” [^73]

## (III)    Ong’s version

81     Ong’s Defence essentially was that his role was confined to that of a lender of monies to Khah, to enable Khah to take on a tenancy of the Premises from Chiang. He said that he thought that Khah was a very diligent person so he agreed to lend him money to operate the business of renting the Premises, with certain conditions:

> (a)     Ong would not have anything to do with this at all;

> (b)     Ong would help Khah find tenants because Ong had good relationships with people and could help Khah fill up the rooms with tenants;

> (c)     Ong would collect the rent from the tenants personally and Khah was not to touch any of the money;

> (d)     Ong would not give Khah money to buy things or pay the rent. Ong would buy the things and then send to Khah, or Ong would pay for things on behalf of Khah; and

> (e)     Ong would deduct 500 to 800 dollars from the amount to pay for the debt Khah owed him. [^74]

82     Ong testified that he kept track of the sum in an “accounts book” but this “accounts book” was said to be destroyed in the fire. [^75]

## (G)    ONG AND KHAH WERE “IN CAHOOTS”

83     I was not persuaded by Khah that he was a mere handyman. Neither was I persuaded by Ong that he was a mere lender to Khah.

## (I)    Khah’s role not a mere handyman

84     It was clear to me that Khah was not a mere handyman who took on assignments at the Premises and was paid for such assignments.

85     Khah agreed during his cross-examination that both Ong and himself represented to Chiang that he (Khah) was the tenant, when, in fact, Ong was the person behind him. [^76] He would not have rented the place from Chiang if not for Ong approaching him to rent the place. [^77]

86     A mere contractor need not have, and would not have, taken on such tenancy.

87     Ong collected all the rent except for 2 rooms which Khah collected in order to pay for the utilities bills to Singapore Power.

88     Again, a mere contractor need not be, and would not be, involved in the collection of rent and the payment of utilities bills.

89     In his Statement dated 16 January 2015, Khah also stated that he had rented a room to a Bangladeshi man known as Main, and asked him to “help…look out for illegal people in the unit”, and upon receiving any information, Khah would inform Ong. [^78]

90     It was also clear that Khah had an interest in the rental and operations of the Premises. Khah got part of the profit [^79], and Ong paid him for the handyman jobs too [^80]:

> “My benefit is that I can **_maintains \[sic\] this house with a certain small percentage of the---the rentals coming in to pay me_**. So I got the---a---a stable incomes \[sic\] in this premises. This is my in---this is what I think that is---will be quite useful to me.” [^81]

> \[emphasis my own\]

> “The **_percentage of the rental is to do the handy jobs and the housekeeping_**. Beside **_anythings \[sic\] that broke downs \[sic\], additional, I will charge Mr Ong for that.”_**[^82]

> \[emphasis my own\]

## (II)    Ong’s role not a mere lender

91     For Ong, similarly I found his assertion of being a mere lender incredible.

92     Ong and Khah had discussed about installing the partitions to the same extent as that during Ong’s tenancy earlier. They had formed the common intention to install partitions at the Premises for it to serve the same purpose as it had when the tenancy was undertaken by Ong.

93     Ong was very actively involved in Khah’s development of the land.

94     For various payments, Ong issued the cheque. [^83] Ong paid for all the materials and paid the monthly rent to Chiang: he would give Khah a cheque and Khah would pass this to Chiang. [^84]

95     Ong exercised a lot of control over the operations at the Premises: Who the tenants were, the amount of rental to be paid by the tenants, etc. Ong even collected the rental from these tenants himself.

96     Khah testified that Ong paid for the air conditioner, water heaters, all the furniture, beds, cupboard. Ong went to buy and order the materials and they sent it to the house. [^85] There were a number of queen size beds in the room, purchased by Ong. [^86]

97     In fact, when Khah needed to buy a fridge, Ong had to go and purchase the fridge and then get it sent to the Premises. [^87]

98     Ong was concerned with even the payment of utilities: “So we had a verbal agreement that whatever needs to---whatever application that he needs to do, for example, to the Singapore Power Services and things as such, Khah would be the one doing all these”. [^88]

99      **In the premises, I was satisfied that both Khah and Ong had the common intention to carry out fire safety works, by erecting partitions, on the Premises. It was also clear that Ong was intentionally aiding Ong in causing a material change of use of the Premises, by providing money to rent and renovate the Premises and sourcing for workers to rent the Premises.**

## PRESCRIBED PUNISHMENT

100    The punishment prescribed for an offence under Section 24(2) of the Fire Safety Act is as follows: fine not exceeding $200,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.

101    The punishment prescribed for an offence under Section 12(1) punishable under Section 12(4) of the Planning Act is as follows: fine not exceeding $200,000.

## SENTENCES SOUGHT BY THE PROSECUTION

102    The Prosecution sought the following sentences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="19.76%"> <col width="33.06%"> <col width="47.18%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Planning Act offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fire Safety Act offence</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Chiang</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$50,000 fine</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 12 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ong</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$60,000 fine</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 14 to 16 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Khah</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$60,000 fine</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 14 to 16 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

103    The Prosecution pointed out that when Section 12 of the Planning Act was amended in **1998**, the maximum penalty was **increased by around 66 times** from a fine of $3,000 to $200,000. [^89] The Court’s sentencing ought to be calibrated in tandem.

104    The Prosecution pointed out that in **2013**, the punishment provision for Section 24 of the Fire Safety Act was increased to align the penalties with similar offences under the Building Control Act and ensure that the penalties continue to have a deterrent effect. [^90] The punishment **increased** from $50,000 and/or 12 months’ imprisonment, to $200,000 and/or 24 months’ imprisonment.

## (A)    PLANNING ACT OFFENCE

105    The Prosecution argued that there was a need for deterrence: based on statistics provided by URA, there has been a substantial number of cases being investigated for owners/tenants converting private residential premises to unauthorised workers’ dormitories [^91]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="19.0561887622475%"> <col width="20.2359528094381%"> <col width="20.2359528094381%"> <col width="20.2359528094381%"> <col width="20.2359528094381%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Year</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2014</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2015</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2016</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2017</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Number of cases</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2500</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2600</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2740</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2800</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">%</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">48.0</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">57.7</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">40.1</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">35.7</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

106    The Prosecution highlighted that in 2017, Parliament had specifically amended the Planning Act to provide for enhanced penalties for an offence in section 12(1) or 12(2) when the use of any land or building is to provide dormitory accommodation. The new section 12(4B) of the Planning Act prescribes a fine not exceeding $200,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 12 months or both. While the Prosecution acknowledged that this provision was not operative at the time of the present offence on 6 December 2014, this underscored Parliament’s intention to treat such offences more seriously. [^92]

107    In their Submissions, the Prosecution also highlighted the following public policy reasons [^93]:

> (a)     Foreign workers, while an essential cog in Singapore’s economy, are a vulnerable group with little bargaining power with respect to their conditions of employment, including their living conditions. They are not likely to know if their housing premises are fire-safety compliant. They need to be protected from abuse and exploitation.

> (b)     Illegal dormitories can cause serious dis-amenities to neighbouring residential or business estates.

> (c)     Offences affecting public safety and public health warrant general deterrence and conduct that hinders or impedes public or social policies must be categorically denounced.

> (d)     It is difficult to detect such offences.

> (e)     Such offences are committed for profit and financial gain, and are extremely lucrative.

108    The Prosecution submitted that for the Planning Act offence, Ong fell into the category of **medium harm - medium culpability** and thus the fine of $60,000 was appropriate:

109    The Prosecution argued that **harm** was **medium**, as it involved the unauthorised use of premises as a worker’s dormitory and unauthorised erection of large structures / earthworks. This was not just a technical breach or minor unauthorised structures in private homes. [^94]

110    In terms of culpability, the Prosecution urged the court to consider:

> (a)     the mens rea of the Accused: whether negligent, reckless or intentional;

> (b)     the level of planning and sophistication of operations;

> (c)     steps taken to increase the number of bed spaces;

> (d)     steps taken to avoid detection or prosecution;

> (e)     whether Accused had committed the offence for profit; and

> (f)     length of time of offending behaviour.

111    The Prosecution pitched Ong’s culpability at the higher end of the **medium culpability** because it was clear Ong and Khah were in cahoots to convert the Premises into a workers’ dormitory. Over 20 foreign workers were housed there.

112    The Prosecution submitted that the mens rea of Ong, as well as Khah, should be pegged as “intentional”, since they were both acting in common intention in relation to the erecting of the partitions which contravene the Planning Act, resulting in a change of use from “residential” to “workers’ dormitory”, knowingly doing so without obtaining the necessary approval for such change of use.

## (B)    FIRE SAFETY ACT OFFENCE

113    For the Fire Safety Act, the Prosecution highlighted that the penalties were enhanced in 2013 to “align the penalties with similar offences under the Building Control Act and ensure that the penalties continue to have a deterrent effect. [^95]

114    In the case of **_PP v Grand City Investment Pte Ltd_** <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 484</span>, the accused, who pleaded guilty, had erected full height partitions to create 20 rooms over its car park lots. It then rented out these rooms to the building occupants for storage purposes. The accused was sentenced to the then maximum fine of $50,000 for the offence under Section 24 of the Fire Safety Act.

115    In the Grounds of Decision of **_Grand City_**, the District Judge in that case noted that the requirements of Section 23 of the Fire Safety Act “put in place public safety on 2 prongs”, namely,

> (a)     Prevention: prior to the erection of any new structures, fire safety requirements are taken in to consideration in the building plans.

> (b)     Containment of fire: Approved building plans will aid the fire-fighting capabilities of the SCDF.

116    For the Fire Safety Act offence, the Prosecution proposed the following framework for claim trial cases and submitted that for the Accused, they fell into the **high harm - medium culpability** category:

117    The Prosecution argued that harm would be considered as high if there was serious property damage and / or personal injury; and fire safety works had severe impact on the means of escape and effectiveness of the fire safety measures. [^96]

118    The Prosecution also argued that the culpability of the Accused would also be medium because they had been reckless in not obtaining the necessary approval from SCDF. In particular, Ong and Khah were driven by profit and had set out in this enterprise to partition the Premises and sublet to the workers. [^97]

119    The Prosecution sought guidance from the Workplace Safety and Health Act and the case of **_Nurun Novi Saydur Rahman v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 236</span>, where the sentencing framework for reckless acts was relied on [^98]:

120    The Prosecution highlighted that as the sentencing framework in **_Nurun_** focused on potential harm, the High Court held at \[107\] that an additional 8 to 40 weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate in cases where death is caused. [^99]

121    The Prosecution argued that the starting point of their sentences should be the higher end of the sentence for medium culpability and high potential harm, i.e. 35 to 40 weeks’ imprisonment.

122    The Prosecution argued that the potential harm was very clear, given that for a fact 4 deaths occurred and various other persons were injured, one of which sustained 30% burns to his body. In the premises, harm would be on the high end. The Prosecution clarified that potential harm was presented by the fact that a lot of foreign workers were placed at risk, and no fire safety measures were in place, and the means of escape were affected, such that when there was a fire there would be an increase in risk to these people being injured. There could have been more than 4 deaths. The Prosecution sought an uplift of 20 weeks because of 4 deaths that resulted. The Prosecution argued that an uplift of 20 weeks was appropriate because in the case of **_Nurun_**, which involved an offence under the Workplace Safety and Health Act, it had an uplift of 12 weeks for 2 deaths.

123    The Prosecution accepted that for Chiang, his culpability would be lower compared to Ong and Khah, though not to the extent that he was merely “negligent”. They argued that by “permitting” and “intentionally aiding by permitting”, Chiang was committing an inentional act. He knew, by 13 August that year, that Khah had erected the partitions, with the intention of subletting the Premises out to more workers. Indeed, he had asked Khah whether the approvals had been obtained, so he must have known of Ong’s and Khah’s intended enterprise. Even if it were not a question of absolute knowledge, it would have been recklessness.

## ONG’S SUBMISSIONS

124    In his mitigation, Ong sought to downplay his role in his incident, stating that he was merely “a party in marketing the services provided by Khah and was not instrumental in the renovations or the operational management of the said premises” [^100]. He asserted that he was never instrumental in the planning process nor the operational stages.

125    He submitted that a fine of $60,000 would be excessive and a custodial sentence would be unwarranted.

126    Ong submitted that he was a 69 years of age, jobless and devastated by the “tragic incident”. He indicated that he was deeply sorry for the sufferings of the families of the 4 deceased, and remorseful, “not that \[he\] had played a pivotal part in \[the\] saga but for the fact that \[he\] should have done more to find out the regulatory and statutory provisions in place at that material time” and “\[he\] could have been more proactive in getting more information and not merely adhere to the advice given by Chiang and Khah”. [^101]

## MY DECISION ON ONG’S SENTENCE

127    Ong had no antecedents. However, I noted also that he had not pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and thus the mitigating factor of a timeous plea of guilt could not be availed to him.

## (A)    PLANNING ACT OFFENCE

128    The setting up of partitions and the soliciting of tenancies with the foreign workers were no mere technical breaches. The partitions were extensive and calculated to generate sufficient rental income for Ong and Khah. There were 24 persons, including 22 foreign workers, staying at the Premises. Preparations, such as the procurement of furniture (including double-decker beds), were also carried out. The operations continued for some 4 months, until the day of the fire.

129    A higher level of occupancy and overcrowding, apart from impeding escape during a fire as the Prosecution witnesses have testified, would also conceivably lead to sanitation and health issues.

130    In terms of culpability, the culpability of Ong cannot be said to be low. Ong was no stranger to the business of renting to foreign workers. Even before the present tenancy taken under Khah’s name, he had already been in the practice of renting out the Property to foreign workers. He formed the common intention with Khah to erect the partitions. He was savvy and had to connection to be able to get tenants readily. Furniture, in particular double-decker beds, were installed at the Premises.

131    The operation was clearly driven by financial considerations: taking Ong at his own best case, it was to generate profits to relieve Khah of his debts owing to Ong, thus clearly of financial benefit to both Ong and Khah.

132    I was not able to peg Ong’s culpability at a mere “negligent” level.

133    I could thus accept for the Planning Act offence, Ong’s involvement could be pegged at **medium harm-medium culpability**.

134    The Prosecution had set out some precedent cases at Annex A of the Prosecution’ Submissions on Sentence, namely:

135    It may well be tempting to note that the cases involving the change of use from residential to workers’ dormitory (cases of **_Emergent Engineering, Lee Tech Engineering, Lai Hung Mei, Soh Mon Kwoi_**) attracted fines no more than $6,000.

136    However, the Prosecution itself noted that since they were unreported cases they are of little precedent value. Also, these cases were not strenuously argued for/against by the Accused.

137    In any event, our present case can be distinguished from the precedent cases involving “workers’ dormitory”.

138    Due to the use of the Premises as a workers’ dormitory and the presence of a grossly huge number of occupants in excess of 8 persons, a great number of people were affected by the fire: 4 persons died, and various others were affected by issues such as smoke inhalation.

139    I was of the view that a fine of $60,000 imposed on Ong would adequately reflect the level of harm and culpability on his part, and also give effect to the full sentencing spectrum.

## (B)    FIRE SAFETY ACT OFFENCE

140    In the present case, not only was there a risk of harm (various Prosecution witnesses had testified about the partitions causing build-up of harmful gases, and about the partitions impeding the means of escape, as well as the adverse effects of a higher occupancy), harm actually materialised, with not 1, but 4 deaths.

141    The actual harm in this case was great. Besides the 4 deaths, other tenants sustained harm or injury due to issues such as smoke inhalation. The Premises were also gutted: the evidence tendered at trial showed the extent of the blackened walls and fixtures (whatever remained) and the loss of personal belongings.

142    The fire safety works carried out were extensive. Ong and Khah sought to partition the Premises to generate sufficient rental income. They failed to obtain the necessary approvals, and as such, the fact that the material used for the partitions was combustible, and that the layout of the partitions impeded escape and caused a build-up of noxious gases, went unchecked.

143    This was not a simple case of, say, a homeowner installing partitions in his own home to create another room for another purpose. Ong and Khah had formed the common intention to install the partitions, with a view that this running of a worker’s dormitory would be a money-making enterprise.

144    I could thus accept for the Fire Safety Act offence, Ong’s involvement could be pegged at **high harm-medium culpability**.

145    For **_Grand City_**, it was fined $50,000 (the **_maximum_** fine **_then_**). Considering Ong’s culpability, it was in no way lesser than **_Grand City’s_** and the punishment meted to Ong must reflect that, taking into account also the applicable sentencing spectrum.

146    In any event, insofar as Ong had argued that the custodial threshold was not crossed in his case, **_Grand City_**, and the other 2 unreported cases cited by the Prosecution (**_PP v Aliyah’s Restaurant and Catering Pte Ltd_**, SCDF00002-2011 and **_PP v Orchard Mall Pte Ltd_**, SCDF000021-2012) were of little guidance in determining whether the custodial threshold was crossed, as these accused were corporate entities. Further, I noted from the Brief Facts distilled by the Prosecution that in **_Aliyah’s_** case, there were 11 persons injured in the gas leaker explosion, but no deaths. In the case of **_Orchard Mall_**, sparks had ignited polystyrene boards stored nearby and sparked a fire, but “there were no fatalities or serious injuries”.

147    I was satisfied that the circumstances of the case warranted a custodial sentence for Ong. That being said, I found the 14 to 16 months’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution to be on the high side. It appeared that Prosecution could have found justification in asking for 16 months’ imprisonment by adding 43 weeks (the higher end of the high potential harm – medium culpability band in **_Nurun_**) to 40 weeks (proposed uplift of 20 weeks for the 4 deaths). However, the need for deterrence and retribution needs to be weighed against the need for proportionality. The punishment must fit the crime. I was of the view that a term of 14 to 16 months’ imprisonment would be crushing.

148    I was of the view that an imprisonment term of 13 months imposed on Ong would adequately reflect the level of harm and culpability on his part, and also give effect to the full sentencing spectrum.

## CONCLUSION

149    I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that “where Parliament has enacted a range of possible sentences, it is the duty of the court to ensure that the full spectrum is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence: **_Ong Chee Eng v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> at \[24\] [^102] .

150    Given the prescribed punishment and the sentencing spectrum, the sentences imposed against Ong cannot be said to be excessive, much less manifestly excessive.

151    It was brought to my attention in the course of this trial that this was the first case of its kind where such deaths had occurred in an illegal workers’ dormitory. This was an unfortunate case where financial gain was sought at the expense of the health and safety of others.

152    Only Ong has appealed, against (only) sentence. Ong is presently on bail pending appeal.
