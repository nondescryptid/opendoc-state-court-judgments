\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9876/2020/01.\]

7 December 2020

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

1       The Accused, Mr Mohamad Ibrahim Castillo bin Ghani (25 years old), pleaded guilty to three charges for cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). I sentenced the Accused to a total of _26 weeks’ imprisonment._

2       The Accused being dissatisfied with the _sentence_ has filed an appeal. The Accused had initially commenced serving sentence on 11 November 2020. After the Accused filed his appeal, I granted his application to stay the execution of his imprisonment term. He was released on _bail pending appeal_ on 19 November 2020.

## The Charges

3       The details of the three charges which the Accused pleaded guilty to were as follows:

>      DAC-915400-2020

>     You \[…\] are charged that you, on the 04th day of March 2020, at about 5.30pm, at Yio Chu Kang MRT Station, Singapore, did cheat Transit Link Pte Ltd (“Transit Link”), to wit, by deceiving Transit Link into believing that you were authorised to use a UOB bank card bearing card number XXX, in the name of Chua Kim Hua, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Transit Link to deliver property in the sum of $100 by crediting it to your EZ-Link card bearing card number 1111700809128461, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

>      DAC-915404-2020

>     You \[…\] are charged that you, on the 04th day of March 2020, at about 7.29pm, at 2 Jurong East Central 1 #XXX, JCube, Singapore, did cheat Abaavo Group Pte Ltd (“Abaavo”), operates the restaurant Wingstop, to wit, by deceiving Abaavo into believing that you were authorised to use a UOB bank card bearing card number XXX, in the name of Chua Kim Hua, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the Abaavo to deliver property in the sum of $57.95 by handing over their merchandise to you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

>      DAC-915405-2020

>     You \[…\] are charged that you, on the 04th day of March 2020, at about 7.57pm, at 2 Jurong East Central 1 #XXX, JCube, Singapore, did cheat Owndays Singapore Pte Ltd (“Owndays”), to wit, by deceiving Owndays into believing that you were authorised to use a UOB bank card bearing card number XXX, in the name of Chua Kim Hua, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Owndays to deliver property in the sum of $356 by handing over two pairs of eyewear to you, valued at $58 and $298 respectively, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

## Facts

4       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification[^1]:

>      **I. PERSONS INVOLVED**

> 1.    The accused is Mohamad Ibrahim Castillo Bin Ghani, male, 25 years’ old, Filipino. At the relevant time of the incident, he was in Singapore under a valid social visit pass.

> 2.    The complainant is one Chua Kim Hua, male, 65 year’s old, Singaporean. He was the owner of a UOB bank card, bearing serial number: XXX (the “**UOB card**”).

> 3.    The first victim is Transit Link Pte Ltd (“**Transit Link**”), located at 9 Maxwell Road #03-02 Annexe A, MND Complex. The company specialises in processing public transport transit transactions and apportions its revenue to the public transport operators in Singapore.

> 4.    The second victim is Abaavo Group Pte Ltd (“**Abaavo**”), located at 16 New Industrial Road, #01-02, Hudson Technocentre, Singapore 536204. It operates Wingstop, a restaurant located at 2 Jurong East Central 1 #01-18, JCube Shopping Mall.

> 5.    The third victim is Owndays Singapore Pte Ltd (“**Owndays**”), an eyewear retailer located at 8 Wilkie Road, #06-01/02, Wilkie Edge, Singapore 228095. The affected Owndays store is located at 2 Jurong East Central 1 #01-11, JCube Shopping Mall.

>      **II. FIRST INFORMATION REPORT**

> 6.    On 6 March 2020, at about 1.44 pm, the complainant lodged a police report at Ang Mo Kio South Neighbourhood Police Centre. He informed that his UOB bank card was missing after making a bank transfer at a UOB Automated Teller Machine near Block 632 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 (the “**UOB ATM**”). Subsequently, upon checking with UOB Bank, he realised that there were unauthorised transactions made on the said card.

>      **III. CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING UP TO THE SECOND, SIXTH, AND SEVENTH CHARGE (DAC-915400-2020, DAC-915404-2020, DAC-915405-2020)**

> 7.    On 4 March 2020, at about 10.20 am, the complainant made a bank transfer at the UOB ATM using the UOB card. After making the transfer, the complainant had forgotten to retrieve the UOB card from the UOB ATM. He then returned home.

> 8.    Subsequently, the accused arrived at the UOB ATM, intending to withdraw money. He then realised that the UOB card was left unattended at the UOB ATM. The accused knew that the UOB card did not belong to him and took it into his possession.

>      **IV. FACTS PERTAINING TO THE SECOND CHARGE (DAC-915400-2020)**

> 9.    After the events in \[8\] had transpired, the accused then travelled to Yio Chu Kang MRT Station. At about 5.30 pm, the accused used the UOB card to top-up $100 onto his EZ-Link card. In doing so, he had therefore falsely represented to Transit Link that he had the authority to use the UOB card, and thereby induced Transit Link to deliver $100 worth of credits into his EZ-Link Card (Card No.: 1111700809128461). Full restitution has been made by the accused to Transit Link.

> 10.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had cheated and thereby dishonestly induced Transit Link, who was so deceived by the accused, to deliver property to him. He has thereby committed the offence of Cheating and Inducing the Delivery of Property, punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

>      **V. FACTS PERTAINING TO THE SIXTH CHARGE (DAC-915404-2020)**

> 11.    On 4 March 2020, at about 7.29 pm, the accused visited Wingstop at JCube Shopping Mall. He then purchased $57.95 worth of items from Wingstop by falsely representing to Abaavo, which operates Wingstop that he had the authority to use the UOB card card, and thereby induced Abaavo to deliver $57.95 worth of Wingstop products to him. Full restitution has been made by the accused to Abaavo.

> 12.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had cheated and thereby dishonestly induced Abaavo, who was so deceived by the accused, to deliver property to him. He has thereby committed the offence of Cheating and Inducing the Delivery of Property, punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

>      **VI. FACTS PERTAINING TO THE SEVENTH CHARGE (DAC-915405-2020)**

> 13.    On 4 March 2020, at about 7.57 pm, the accused visited Owndays at JCube Shopping Mall. He then purchased two pairs of eyewear with a total value of $356.00 from Owndays, by falsely representing to Owndays that he had the authority to use the UOB card, and thereby induced Owndays to deliver $356.00 worth of Owndays products to him. The two pairs of eyewear are valued at $58.00 and $298.00. Full restitution had been made to Owndays. In addition, the 2 pairs of eyewear, along with the warranty card issued by Owndays, had since been recovered from the accused.

> 14.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had cheated and thereby dishonestly induced Owndays, who was so deceived by the accused, to deliver property to him. He has thereby committed the offence of Cheating and Inducing the Delivery of Property, punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Charges taken into consideration

5       The Accused admitted and consented to have the following seven charges be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing:

> (a)     Six charges under section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating using the same UOB card on 4 March 2020; and

> (b)     One charge under section 403 of the Penal Code for dishonestly misappropriating the UOB card.

## Antecedents

6       The Accused had the following antecedents:

7       Prior to the above convictions, the Accused had been placed on 18 months’ probation by the Juvenile Court in 2009 in relation to offences of theft and theft in dwelling under sections 379 and 380 of the Penal Code respectively.

## Sentence

### Prescribed punishment

8       Section 420 of the Penal Code provided that an offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

9       The prosecution tendered skeletal sentencing submissions, supplemented by oral submissions in Court, and sought a global sentence of at least 7 months’ imprisonment against the Accused. This comprised of the following proposed sentences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"> <col width="50%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Imprisonment Term</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-915400-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-915404-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 months (concurrent)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-915405-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

10     The prosecution submitted that the dominant sentencing considerations were general and specific deterrence. Citing the case of _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (“_Fernando Payagala_”) at \[19\] and \[20\], the prosecution emphasised that given the pre-eminence and pervasiveness of credit cards as a preferred mode of payment in day-to-day commerce, as well as the need to preserve public confidence in our financial institutions, a severe stance must be taken in relation to credit card frauds. As such, general deterrence would be a vital consideration and harsh custodial sentences were to be expected.

11     As for specific deterrence, the prosecution submitted that the Accused had multiple property-related antecedents and thus a strong deterrent sentence was warranted.

12     The prosecution next referred to _Fernando Payagala_ at \[75\] where the High Court indicated that the starting point of the sentencing tariffs for non-syndicated stolen or misappropriated credit card offences was 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment per charge. In considering the appropriate sentence, the prosecution urged the Court to take into account factors such as the degree of planning and premeditation, sophistication of the offence, number of offences and quantum involved, extent of actual loss caused, as well as remorse shown.

13     The prosecution submitted that in this case, the quantum involved in the proceeded charges was $513.95, which was not an insignificant amount. Furthermore, there were seven related charges taken into consideration. However, the prosecution acknowledged that the Accused made full restitution to all affected parties.

14     In support of the proposed sentences, the prosecution referred the Court to various sentencing precedents and submitted that the precedents indicated that similar charges involving $200 to $300 would warrant an imprisonment term of about 2 to 3 months. However, in view of the charges taken into consideration and the Accused’s property-related antecedents, the prosecution submitted that an uplift was warranted, to arrive at a global sentence of at least 7 months’ imprisonment.

### Mitigation

15     In mitigation, the Accused informed the Court that his father was old and could no longer support him. The Accused had also tried his best to make full restitution, with some help from his mother, even though it had been financially difficult to do so. The Accused pleaded for leniency and highlighted that he might be repatriated to the Philippines after serving sentence.

16     At the further mentions of the case, the Accused tendered a letter to the Court to highlight additional points in mitigation. In the letter, he stated that he realised he was wrong and had the intention to surrender and return the money to the victim, but was not mentally prepared to face the consequences of his actions, until he was arrested.

17     The Accused stated that he wished to apologise and pleaded for a shorter sentence. He explained that he was born in the Philippines but raised in Singapore by his biological parents. He had struggled for years when he was previously deported to the Philippines as he did not have anyone to rely on. The Accused added that he would be marrying his Singaporean fiancée in September 2021 and the wedding was planned before his family was informed about his court case. The Accused pleaded that it would be most heart-breaking if the Court were to deport him.

18     The Accused sought the Court’s forgiveness and sympathy and promised not to repeat or commit any offence again.

### Sentencing considerations

19     In calibrating sentence in this case, I took guidance from the High Court’s decision in _Fernando Payagala_ which laid down the sentencing principles applicable to offences relating to credit card fraud, as well as the sentencing tariffs for section 420 Penal Code credit card cheating offences. The High Court noted that general and specific deterrence must feature as the vital, if not dominant sentencing considerations for such offences and observed that the larger the number of offences committed and the higher the quantum involved, the heftier the sentence. In addition, the High Court held at \[48\] that the total sentence imposed on a serial cheat would not only be higher than the sentence imposed on an offender convicted of a single cheating offence for the same quantum, but be “significantly higher” in the appropriate circumstances since a serial offender would be hard put to submit that his conduct was the result of momentary indiscretion.

20      _Fernando Payagala_ was also instructive as a sentencing precedent for the current case as it similarly involved a relatively young foreign national who went on a spending spree after misappropriating a credit card. The offender in that case had pleaded guilty to two charges -- one under section 403 of the Penal Code for misappropriating the credit card belonging to a fellow passenger on a flight to Singapore, and another under section 420 of the Penal Code for using that credit card to purchase a laptop valued at $1,522. Two other similar cheating charges and one attempted cheating charge were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

21     In enhancing the sentence for the charge under section 420 of the Penal Code from 2 to 6 months’ imprisonment, the High Court adopted the starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment as the appropriate benchmark. In this respect, the High Court noted that the value of the fraudulent purchases made by the offender amounted to about $6,000, which was not an insubstantial amount. The offender had made three successful purchases with the credit card and only stopped on the fourth attempt because the card was rejected. The offender also could not be said to have committed the offences as a result of momentary indiscretion as he had embarked on “an extended shopping binge” and stopped only because the last transaction was blocked by the issuing bank. The High Court also found the offender’s conduct in seeking to take advantage of his short transit stay in Singapore and, thereafter, attempting to take flight, troubling.[^2]

22     Nonetheless, the High Court discounted the benchmark sentence of 12 months to take into account certain mitigating factors, including the fact that the offences, though premeditated, were committed without any proper planning and lacked sophistication. In addition, no loss was occasioned. Also, the offender was relatively young (being 20 years old when he committed the offences), did not have any antecedents, and was assessed to possess a higher amenability to rehabilitation and a correspondingly lower necessity for specific deterrence. The High Court also made allowance for the fact that the offender had been released from prison custody before the hearing of the appeal whereby the sentence was enhanced.[^3]

23     Turning to the present case, for each of the three proceeded charges, I similarly adopted the starting benchmark of 12 months’ imprisonment. This was at the lower end of the 12 to 18 months’ tariff per charge set out in _Fernando Payagala_ for first-time offenders involved in non-syndicated stolen or misappropriated credit card offences. Next, I proceeded to calibrate the sentence for each charge based on the facts and circumstances of the case. In doing so, I took into consideration the following factors:

> (a)     The sums involved in the proceeded charges in this case were not particularly large and were significantly lower than those in _Fernando Payagala_. That said, the amounts set out in the proceeded charges could not be considered to be negligible either. Further, the facts showed that the Accused had embarked on a fraudulent spending spree lasting about four hours and chalked up a total of $587.08 on the UOB card over nine distinct transactions with nine different victims.

> (b)     In addition, unlike the offender in _Fernando Payagala_, the Accused was neither a youthful offender below 21 years old at the time of the offences, nor was he a first-time offender. Indeed, as submitted by the prosecution, the Accused’s previous property antecedents (all of which involved an element of dishonesty) pointed to a heightened need for specific deterrence in this case. In particular, I noted with concern that the Accused’s previous incarceration at the Reformative Training Centre (coupled with his self-professed fear of deportation) did not appear to have been sufficient to deter him from committing multiple offences in the instant case.

> (c)     Nonetheless, similar to the offender in _Fernando Payagala_, the offences committed by the Accused, though pre-meditated, were not elaborate nor sophisticated. Unlike the offender in _Fernando Payagala_, the Accused did not take any steps to avoid detection or apprehension. In the Accused’s favour, I noted that he had made full restitution to all affected parties and had pleaded guilty as a sign of his remorse.

24     In arriving at the appropriate sentence for each charge, I also had regard to the other sentencing precedents highlighted by the prosecution. In particular, the outcomes of the appeals in _PP v Sofian bin Ismail_ (MA 53/2009, <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 69</span>) and _PP v Ong Xiao Li_ (MA 6/2008, <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 11</span>) indicated that the sentence for _first-time offenders_ for a credit card fraud charge under section 420 of the Penal Code involving between $200 to $300 was about 2 months to 10 weeks’ imprisonment.[^4]

### Sentence imposed

25     Hence, having carefully weighed all the facts and circumstances of this case, I discounted the sentence for each of the three proceeded charges from the 12 months benchmark and imposed the following sentences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.62%"> <col width="28.08%"> <col width="38.3%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Imprisonment Term</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-915400-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$100</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-915404-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$57.95</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-915405-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$356</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 weeks</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

26     I further ordered the sentences for DAC-915400-2020 and DAC-915405-2020 to run consecutively and the sentence for DAC-915404-2020 to run concurrently. In my view, the total sentence of 26 weeks’ imprisonment would be proportionate to the Accused’s culpability and sufficient for the purpose of deterrence.
