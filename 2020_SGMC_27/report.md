Road Traffic – Offences – Failure to conform with traffic red light signal

Evidence – Identification evidence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9330/2019/ 01.\]

5 May 2020

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against an order of acquittal.

2       Ngan Gim Seng (“the Accused”) is a 54 year-old male Singaporean who claimed trial to one charge under s.120(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap 276 (“RTA”) for failing to conform with the traffic red light signal along North Canal Road towards Merchant Road (junction of Eu Tong Sen Street) on 20 November 2017 at about 1827 hrs whilst driving motor vehicle SBU1881H.

## CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

3       Four witness were called by the Prosecution. The main witness is PW3 and he is the officer that saw the Accused’s vehicle beat the the red light signal.

### Evidence of Muhammad Nazri Bin Sapar (“PW3”)

4       PW3 is a Traffic Police Officer and is the main witness in this case. On 20 November 2017, he was on duty from 1300 hrs to 2300 hrs. Later that day, he was assigned to a static station duty by himself at the junction of North Canal Road and Eu Tong Seng Street. The aim of this duty is to keep a look out for vehicles who fail to conform to traffic red light signal at the junction. He had previously observed that vehicles tended to beat the traffic lights at this junction.

5       PW3 parked his motorcycle nearby and walked to the junction. At about 1805 hrs, he commenced his static duty at the junction. He positioned himself near lamppost 9. From this position, he would be looking across the junction at the three traffic lights near Merchant Road.[^1] These traffic lights would be visible to vehicles traveling from North Canal Road towards Merchant Road. He estimated that these lights would be 30 to 40 metres away from his position.[^2]

6       He explained what he would usually do. First, he would make sure that his left shoulder was in line with the stop line. Then he would look at the abovementioned traffic lights. Once the lights turned red, he would start counting _“one thousand, two thousand”_, then at the same time look over to the stop line which was in line with his left shoulder. If all four wheels of a vehicle crosses the stop line after the count, he would proceed to record the vehicle registration number, followed by the vehicle make, vehicle colour and the vehicle type.

7       At about 1827 hrs, when the traffic light signal turned red for vehicles turning right into Eu Tong Sen Street, he proceeded to count _“one thousand, two thousand.”_ He then turned his head left towards the stop line and saw a vehicle cross the stop line on the extreme right lane of North Canal Road. When all four wheels of the vehicle crossed the stop line, he focused his attention on the vehicle registration number.

8       PW3 explained that the width of the junction meant that the vehicle would have to travel straight for a short distance before turning right. He would therefore have an opportunity to note the vehicle registration number without any obstruction. The vehicle would be about 3 car lengths away from his position when this happened.[^3]

9       Having seen the number, he repeated to himself – _“Sierra, Bravo, Uniform, 1-1-8-1 Hotel”_ – ie. SBU1181H aloud, followed by the vehicle colour and vehicle type before recording this information in his notebook. He would later transfer this information into the Patrol Log Sheet.[^4]

10     Without speeding, the vehicle gradually turned right, entering Eu Tong Seng Street in the direction of Hill Street. From the time PW3 noticed the vehicle until the time it left his sight, he estimated that the duration to be about five seconds. PW3 identified the vehicle as a White Hyundai motorcar with the registration plate number SBU1881H. There was nothing unusual about the vehicle, it was _“typical Hyundai white car”_.[^5]

11     PW3 further noted that traffic flow was moderate, road surface dry, weather was fine and visibility was clear although it had been raining earlier. PW3 did not notice the driver. He was therefore unable to tell if the driver was male or female. Neither could he say whether there were any passengers in the vehicle. He confirmed that there was no video recording available as it was not his practice to make a video recording and this was not part of the standard procedure.[^6]

12     PW3’s duty ended at about 1845 hours, then he return to Traffic Police Headquarters (“TPHQ”). At TPHQ, PW3 lodged the report in the Traffic Information Management System at about 2247 hrs[^7]. PW3 highlighted that the system would only generate a report if a valid vehicle registration number were inserted. It would, however, not prompt PW3 if the other information regarding the car, such as the model and colour, was incorrect.

### Evidence of Fong Ah Kiew (“PW1”)

13     PW1 is the General Manager of ATS Traffic Private Limited that maintains the traffic lights at the junction in question. He prepared the traffic light report.[^8] The report noted that there was no report of malfunctioning of the traffic lights at that junction. It also sets out the traffic light sequence for that intersection.

### Evidence of Ridhayanti Binti Jalah (“PW2”)

14     PW2 is the Operations Executive of Secure Parking Pte Ltd. The company maintains the carparks located at Clement Avenue 4 (“C13M”) and 470 Upper Serangoon Crescent (“HG1C”). Based on the In-Vehicle Unit (“IU”) number provided by the police, the company extracted the entry and exit information of the vehicle from the two carparks from their computer system a few weeks prior to the present trial. The extracted information[^9] show the entry and exit records for SBU1881H on 20 November 2017 for carparks CM13 and HG1C:

> a.     1520 hrs: entered CM13;

> b.     1754 hrs: exited CM13;

> c.     1928 hrs: entered HG1C;

> d.     2125 hrs: exited HG1C; and

> e.     2228 hrs: entered CM13.

### Evidence of Kevin Koh (“PW4”)

15     PW4 is the Investigation Officer. He was assigned this case only in March 2019 as the case was going for trial.

16     He explained that once the report of a traffic offence is lodged, a _Notice to Furnish Driver’s Particulars_ would be issued to the registered owner of the vehicle. In this case, the Accused’s name was furnished by the registered owner of the vehicle. Thereafter, a _Notice of Traffic Offence_ was issued against him.

17     As part of his investigations, he calculated the time taken to travel to the different locations. The time taken for him to drive from Clementi Block 309, Clementi Avenue 4 to North Canal Road would take about 22 minutes and thereafter from North Canal Road to Upper Serangoon View, it would have taken another 25 minutes. A total of about 47 minutes. The time taken for him to travel from Clementi Avenue 4 directly to Upper Serangoon Road was about 40-45 minutes.

18     PW4 also made other checks. He checked the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) to establish whether SBU1881H had crossed the Electronic Road Pricing (“ERP”) gantry along Eu Tong Seng Street on 20 November 2017. However, LTA informed him that such records would only kept for 2 days, or, if an ERP offence has been committed, 2 days after payment has been made. He did not check the police cameras in the area as he knew that the recordings would be kept for, at most 9 months. He did not check the Accused’s cash card transaction records for the day in question because it did not occur to him to do so.

## CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

19     The case for the Defence is also straightforward. This was a case of mistaken identity on the part of PW3.

### Evidence of Ngan Gim Seng (“the Accused”)

20     The Accused does not dispute that he was the driver of SBU1881H on 20 November 2017. On the day in question, he exited carpark C13M located at Clementi Avenue 4 at about 1754 hrs. He was heading towards Serangoon Secondary School located at Upper Serangoon Road for his son’s concert. His daughter, DW2 accompanied him.

21     According to the Accused, upon leaving the carpark. He first made a U-turn, passed Clementi Avenue 5, thereafter

> “ …. turned left into Clementi Avenue 2, then on to Clementi Road ….. kept right, then to Ulu Pandan Road then Holland Road. Then after Holland Road, turned left to Farrer Road. Then, went straight to Adam Road, Lornie Road then straight. And then, Braddell Road, Toa Payoh Flyover, and went straight to\[wards\] Serangoon. Turned left to …. Upper Serangoon ….. And then, straight to --- turned right and then turned left and reached that school.”[^10]

22     The Accused explained that, as it was raining, he let his daughter DW2 alight under a shelter at the school. He then waited for a carpark lot within Serangoon Secondary School as he did not want to walk too much. This was in part due to his medical condition, a heart condition.[^11] Unfortunately, he was unsuccessful in finding a carpark lot as two or three schools were also involved in the concert. As and the concert was about to start, he had no choice but to search for a carpark lot nearby. He was unfamiliar with the surrounding roads but eventually managed to find a carpark lot nearby.

23     Later that evening, the Accused left carpark HG1C at 2125 hrs and returned to carpark CM13C at about 2228 hrs. There was no reason for him to enter the city area that day and he did not travel past North Canal Road.

### Evidence of Jasmine Yan ZiYun (“DW2”)

24     DW2 is the daughter of the Accused. At the time of the trial, she was a law graduate doing her Part B. On 20 November 2017, she attended a concert at Serangoon Secondary School with her father. Her brother was performing in the concert that was scheduled to start at 1930 hrs.

25     She left home with her father at about 1800 hrs. It was an early start as her father did not like to rush. As a non-driver, she was unable to tell the court which route her father had taken that day but she was able to say that her father did not drive into the city because she had previously worked in the area. By “city” she meant the area that included Chinatown, North Canal Road, Eu Tong Sen Street, the area around Central Mall etc.

## Closing Submissions

### Prosecutions Submissions

#### Quality of the identification Evidence

26     It was submitted that the quality of the identification evidence in this case was good. This was because:

> a.      Observation time. The size of the junction[^12] meant that the Accused would have to travel straight for some distance before making the right turn. PW3 had observe the Accused’s vehicle for about five seconds. This was sufficiently long for PW3 to have a good observation of the vehicle licence plate number, model and colour of the vehicle;

> b.      Distance from vehicle. The distance of PW3 from the offending vehicle was about 3 car lengths[^13] when he observed the vehicle licence number, before it commenced its turn into Eu Tong Sen Street;

> c.      Lack of obstruction. PW3 had positioned himself in such a manner so that nothing that would block his view. In addition, visibility was clear.

#### Accuracy of the Identification Evidence

27     In addition to the quality of the identification evidence, the Prosecution submitted factors that would affect the accuracy of the information obtained by PW3 were:

> a.      A police officer. PW3 is an experienced police officer who had undergone structured training by traffic police including training on how to spot traffic violators;

> b.      Lapse of time between observation and recording of details. Once the Accused’s vehicle had filed to conform to the traffic red light signal, PW3 would recite aloud the details of the vehicle and record this information on the notepad. This information was then be transferred to the patrol log-sheet within a day;

> c.      No discrepancies between observation and details recorded. The description of the offending vehicle was a total match with that of the Accused’s vehicle. When PW3 lodged a report of a traffic offence in the computer system, he was able to do so because he had entered a valid vehicle registration number. The system does not track the accuracy of a vehicle’s make or colour.

#### Other Factors Supporting the Identification Evidence

28     The Prosecution also highlighted the other factors supporting the identification evidence of PW3. This included:

> a.      Opportunity. PW4 had done a time trial from Block 309, Clementi Avenue 4 to North Canal Road and then to Upper Serangoon View. The time taken was 22 and 25 minutes respectively. A total of 47 minutes. The objective evidence showed that 94 minutes had elapsed from the time the Accused’s vehicle left CM13 and entered HG1C;

> b.      Evidence of PW3. His evidence was both internally and externally consistent. He explained clearly how he recorded the offending vehicles registration number, colour and make and how he recorded the details.

#### Quality of the Defence’s Evidence

29     The Prosecution submits the lack in quality of the Defence’s evidence, in particular, that of the Accused.

> a.      Defence is an afterthought. The Accused only chose to give his version to the court at trial. He had no explanation why he failed to provide such details to the traffic police. The route described by the Accused was the route he _would have_ taken from Clementi to Serangoon;[^14]

> b.      DW2’s evidence does not assist the defence. The Prosecution highlighted the inconsistences in DW2’s evidence. Although she was unable to recollect the route, she was nonetheless certain that the vehicle did not drive past where the alleged offence occurred. Her evidence does not therefore corroborate the Accused’s version. She had an opportunity to raise this at her various appeals to the traffic police but only did so in March 2019.

### Defence Submissions

#### Identification Evidence

30     The Defence essentially challenges the quality of PW3’s identification evidence. The Defence submits that the positioning of PW3 near lamppost 9 with the stop line perpendicular to his left shoulder affected the accuracy of the identification of the Accused’s vehicle for the following reasons:

> a.      Viewing angle. This was an awkward angle to note the vehicle licence plate of any vehicle turning right from North Canal Road into Eu Tong Sen Street. Even PW3 acknowledges that the angle at which he could see the vehicle registration number plate may be less than 45 degrees. A better position for PW3 would have been directly across the road (ie Merchant Road side) from where he was standing. This position would have given PW3 a better view of vehicles turning right into Eu Tong Sen Street from North Canal Road[^15];

> b.      Visibility. According to the Astronomical and Tidal Information (Monthly Data),[^16] for 20 November 2017, sunset was at 1852 hours. As the incident occurred at about 1827 hours, the period of twilight between day and night, as the sun is setting, it would affect visibility. This was acknowledged by PW3 himself;[^17]

> c.      PW3’s vision. It was submitted that due to PW3’s eyesight and astigmatism, it would be more difficult for him to see a moving target at about sunset, in particular, as what his was attempting to do was to read off something that was about the size of an A4 piece of paper.

> d.      Traffic condition. The alleged offence occurred on Monday, 20 November 2017 at 1827 hours. This was a workday. PW3 acknowledge that traffic at the junction would be heavy, with vehicles coming out of the Raffles Place area[^18] and this this heavy traffic flow would have caused a distraction.[^19]

#### Investigations were lacking

31     It Defence submits that, notwithstanding the resources available to the police, investigations into this matter was lacking. First, although the Accused had, as early as April 2018, about 4 months after the alleged incident, no attempt was made to obtain any video footage from the police cameras in the area.[^20] Also, no attempt was made to obtain any details from the cash card in the car as this did not cross PW4’s mind.[^21]

#### Evidence of the Accused

32     The Defence submitted that the Accused was a credible witness. He had clearly explained the route that he took to travel from Clementi Avenue 4 to the Upper Serangoon area where Serangoon Secondary School was located. His had explained that he did not enter carpark HG1C till much later as he had dropped off DW2 at the school and he was looking for a carpark lot within the school compound due to his medical condition. He only sought an alternate place to park his vehicle as the concert was about to begin. His explanation lot was clear and unequivocal. His version never wavered at any time during the cross-examination.

33     It was also submitted that DW2 was a credible witness and her evidence ought to be accepted. DW2 was candid in her testimony to acknowledge that she did not know the exact route that was taken by the Accused and did not overstate her evidence in anyway. It was also submitted that that the evidence of DW2 should be accepted as it was left unchallenged by the Prosecution and the Prosecution did not put its case to DW2.

## Analysis of the Evidence

34     I first note that the Defence does not dispute the following evidence.

> a.     That the Accused was the driver of SBU1881H and was registered in the name of the Accused’s wife;

> b.     The Accused lives at Block 309 Clementi Avenue 4 and had left the carpark C13M located at Clementi Avenue 4 at 1754 hrs driving SBU1881H;

> c.     The Accused entered carpark HG1C located at 470 Upper Serangoon Crescent in SBU1881H at 1928 hrs;

> d.     The Accused left carpark HG1C at 2125 hrs in SBU1881H and returned to carpark C13M at 2218 hrs.

### The quality of the identification

35     The main issue rested on the quality of PW3’s identification of the vehicle allegedly driven by the Accused. As the case for the Prosecution depended wholly on the correctness of the identification evidence which the Defence alleged to be mistaken, I considered the following factors:

#### Length of time that PW3 observed the vehicle

36     PW3 had an opportunity to observe the vehicle for five seconds[^22], from the time when all four wheels of the vehicle crossed the stop line until it turned right into Eu Tong Sen Street. I agreed with the Prosecution that five seconds would be sufficiently long enough for PW3 to have a good view of a vehicle licence plate. However, the issue is whether PW3 did indeed have the vehicle under observation for five whole seconds, and, if not (or yes), how long did he have to observe the vehicle licence plate.

37     We first look at the relative distances involved[^23]. An estimate of the distance from the static position of PW3 to the extreme right lane of Eu Tong Sen Street is about 25 or so metres. Whilst the distance from the static position of PW3 to the extreme right lane of North Canal Road is about 15 metres. A vehicle turning right from the extreme right lane of North Canal Road into the extreme right lane of Eu Tong Seng Street would therefore have to cover a distance of about 30 metres. There is no evidence to show how fast the vehicle was travelling, except that it was making a _gradual turn_ and was not speeding. Therefore, in all likelihood, the vehicle would have cleared the _entire_ junction between 3 seconds (at 40km/h) and 4 seconds (at 30 km/h), conservatively speaking. We are also able to note this timing from the video footage tendered by the Defence.[^24]

![]([2020] SGMC 0027_Image/[2020] SGMC 0027_image1.png)

38     Even if I were to accept that PW3 might have been able to observe _the vehicle_ for about 5 seconds, it was highly unlikely that he could observe _the vehicle licence plate_ for the same amount of time. PW3 would only be able to observe the vehicle licence plate when the vehicle was in the middle portion of the junction. This would therefore mean that the observation time would be at most about 2 seconds, more likely a shorter period. This is significantly less than the 5 seconds stated by PW3.

#### Angle of observation

39     Due to the positioning PW3, his line of sight to the vehicle licence plate would always be at an angle. However, PW3 has explained that, due to the size of the junction, a vehicle would have to travel straight for _some_ distance before it could make a right into Eu Tong Seng Street. This is as shown in the sketch plan drawn by PW3 but admitted as D3.

![]([2020] SGMC 0027_Image/[2020] SGMC 0027_image2.png)

40     However, I note that this sketch plan does not sit well with the satellite photo at Fig 1, above. In Figure 1, we can see the rubber tire marks on the road cutting across the junction from the extreme right lane along North Canal Road into the extreme right lane of Eu Tong Sen Street showing how a vehicle would execute this turn. It is clear that it is unlikely a vehicle would be travelling straight first before turning right as explained by PW3 as to how he managed to see the vehicle licence plate.

41     In addition, from the video footage in D4, we can clearly see that the vehicles turning right from North Canal Road into Eu Tong Seng Street did so by making a gradual right turn. None of the vehicles captured by the video footage appeared to execute the turning in the manner as described as PW3. We are also able to see that throughout the entire turn, their vehicle licence plates could only be seen at an angle, if at all. In fact, none of the vehicle licence numbers in the video could be made out in the video footage.

42     I therefore have my doubts as to whether PW3 had a good observation of the licence plate as he would be looking at it at from an angle at all times. The best view of it would be when the offending vehicle reached the apex of the turn, in the middle of the junction and even then, it would have to have been for an extremely short period of time.

#### Distance at which the observation was made

43     As mentioned, PW3 testified that when he saw the licence plate of the offending vehicle, it was about three car lengths away, just before it commenced its turning into Eu Tong Sen Street[^25]. This appears to put the vehicle at the apex of the turn. Based on the satellite image at Figure 1, this would be in the approximately range of about 12 – 15 metres. In my view, this appears to be relatively good approximation. However, I would not characterize PW3 as being in _“close proximity to D1’s vehicle”[^26]._

44     Even if the offending vehicle had to travel _straight_ for a distance before commencing executing the right turn, rather than making a gradual turn to the right, it would mean that PW3 first saw the vehicle licence plate when it was already halfway through its turn. This view of the vehicle licence plate would have lasted for an extremely short time before the vehicle started its right turn and the angle at which PW3 could see the vehicle licence plate would be reduced very rapidly with distance between PW3 and the vehicle expanding just as fast.

45     While the distance at which PW3 says he observed the vehicle licence plate would have provided good observation if a vehicle was stationary, the offending vehicle was not. Hence there was a doubt as to how good PW3’s observation of the vehicle and the vehicle licence plate was.

#### Weather, Visibility and Road Conditions

46     It appears strange to me that PW3 has characterized the weather to be _fine_ and the road surface _dry_. At 1757 hrs, just half an hour before the Accused’s vehicle allegedly crossed the junction, PW3 had noted in Exhibit P3 that the road surface was _wet_ and that it was _drizzling_. In fact, this description is consistent with the Metrological Report prepared by the Metrological Service Singapore[^27] which assessed that the weather at the junction included, amongst other things, that there was light rain from 1730 – 1900 hrs. D2 is not disputed by the Prosecution. Accordingly, if there was light rain in the area, it may affect PW3’s ability in reading off a vehicle’s licence plate while it was executing the turn.

47     It is also not disputed by the Prosecution that sunset was at 1852 hrs on 20 November 2017. This would mean that 1827 hrs, the sun would be low in the sky to the west. I note that North Canal Road towards Merchant Road lies in a general north-west direction, therefore, the setting sun would lay in the general direction of offending vehicle as it executed the turn from North Canal Road into Eu Tong Seng Street. This could affect the observation of the offending vehicle’s licence plate.

48     Looking at all the various factors that I have described above, I am unable to agree with the Prosecution that PW3’s identification evidence can be characterized as “good” although PW3 did record down the particulars of the offending vehicle on his notebook and subsequently transferred this information on to the log sheet

### Other evidence

#### Report of Traffic Offence

49     Although I am hesitant to describe the identification evidence as good, I note that at the end of the day, a report of traffic offence was lodged by PW3. The description of the offending vehicle and vehicle licence plate number SBU1881H was a total match.

50     As the computer system would only generate a report if a valid vehicle registration number was keyed in, the Prosecution submits that, in order for PW3 to make a mistake in the vehicle registration number, “_PW3 would have to commit several mistakes to randomly obtain the correct permutation of features that matches DW1’s vehicle_.”[^28] I do not disagree with the submission by the Prosecution.

#### Evidence of PW4

51     As part of his investigations as the Investigation Officer, PW4 calculated the time taken to travel to the various locations. In particular, he calculated the time taken to travel directly from Clementi Avenue 4 to Upper Serangoon Road directly ie. 40 minutes and from Clementi Avenue 4 to Upper Serangoon Road _via_ North Canal Road ie. A total of 47 minutes.

52     Although this would show that the Accused could have travelled to Upper Serangoon Road _via_ North Canal Road and would still have been able to reach Serangoon Secondary School on tie, I was not particularly satisfied with this “test”. First, there is no evidence led as to what day or what time this test took place. Also, no evidence was led as to what the traffic conditions were at the time of the test and neither was any information given regatrding the weather. I was therefore unable to assess how accurate this test was. For example, roads heading out of the city area in the evening peak hour would invariably be more crowded, in particular, major arterial roads out of the city like Serangoon Road that the Accused had to use if he were heading towards Upper Serangoon Road. Hence, while PW4 had done due diligence by performing this “test”, I put little weight on it as there are many factors that are not accounted for.

### Whether PW3’s evidence was unusually convincing

53     PW3 is a traffic police officer of a few years standing. He has performed many of these static duties at this very same junction. There appears to be nothing out of the ordinary regarding this incident on 20 November 2017 that would cause it to be etched in PW3’s mind.

54     The Prosecution has submitted that PW3 was detailed in his recollection of the events and had given a step-by-step demonstration as to what happened. In my assessment, it would appear that what PW3 had described was not so much what actually happened on 20 November 2017, but what he would do at the junction to record the particulars of a vehicle that had failed to conform with the traffic red light signal.

55     Overall, I would conclude that while I found PW3’s evidence convincing, I would not describe it as unusually convincing.

## Evidence from the Defence

#### Evidence of the Accused

56     As it is common for many traffic offences of this nature, the Prosecution would have one main witness while the defence would usually also have one main witness, the Accused. This would usually be in the form of a denial, which would ultimately be very difficult to prove.

57     Unlike PW3, 20 November 2017 was special to the Accused. His son was performing in a concert at Serangoon Secondary School. While this may be so, it would be difficult for him to recall the exact route that he would take. Unlike PW3, drivers do not keep written records of their routes. I therefore accept that whilst he may not have been able to recall the exact route to the school, he was clear in the route that he would have taken to the school. This route appears to be the most logical and fastest route if one were to travel from Clementi Avenue 4 to Upper Serangoon Road directly.

58     The objective evidence show that 94 minutes had elapsed from when the Accused left carpark C13M until he entered carpark HG1C. However, I note that this timing did not reflect the entire travel time. The Accused own estimate was that he reached the school in 40-45 minutes.[^29] It was raining and he had dropped DW2 at a shelter at the school and then waited to see if he could get a parking lot within the school. He did not want to walk too far due to his heart condition. Only when he could not get a parking lot and the concert was about to begin did he then look for a nearby carpark lot. In my view, this this sequence of events appear logical and externally consistent.

59     The objective evidence thereafter showed that the Accused left HG1C at 2125 hrs and entered C13M at 2218 hours, about 53 minutes later. It does not appear that the Accused had made any detour from his stated route if at all. Nether has the Prosecution suggested that this was the case. As highlighted by the Defence, he has accounted for the longer time taken for the onward journey as opposed to the return journey.[^30]

#### Evidence of DW2

60     Like the Accused, except for the fact that her brother was performing at a concert at Serangoon Secondary School, 20 November 2017 was like any ordinary day. Whilst, it is true that the evidence of DW2 could have been better, it does not mean that her evidence is an afterthought.

61     I found her to be straightforward and truthful in her evidence. She candidly admitted that she was unable to tell the court what route her father, the Accused, took that day. She could only say that the vehicle did not enter the city. She further explained that although she did not recognise the route taken, she did not recognise passing by any of the familiar buildings in the area on the day in question. I believe she has tried to explain to the best of her ability what had happened that day. She did not, overstate her evidence, nor did she attempt to manufacture any evidence.

## Conclusion

62     The onus is always on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not on an Accused to prove that he is not guilty. In this case, the Prosecution’s case lies almost solely on the visual evidence of PW3. Therefore, the quality of his identification evidence should be high.

63     As I have noted above, for a variety of reasons I did not think that the quality of PW3’s identification evidence was as good as the Prosecution would like to make it out to be. For example, in cross-examination, PW3 conceded that the traffic at the junction at peak hour would have caused a distraction, and that twilight would cause visibiity to decrease. It also appears that PW3’s description of the weather that day appears to be incorrect.

64     Although there is other evidence that suggests that the Accused may have driven through the junction in question on 20 November 2017, in particular what was recorded by PW3, this was in my view, not totally conclusive. As highlighted by the Defence, PW3’s own evidence is that it is possible for other cars, even other white Hyundai cars to have the licence plate with ‘1881’[^31]. This was also acknowledged by PW4[^32]. There is therefore a possibility that PW3 had mistakenly recorded the particulars of the Accused’s car by mistake.

65     In this case, when the defence was called, the Accused opted to testify. He has, from the beginning, maintained the version that he told the Court at trial. I did not think that it was an afterthought. I also did not think that his answers were evasive. His answers were clear and straight forward. His decription of his trip from Clementi Avenue 4 after leaving the carpark C13M until he entered HG1C was logical and consistent. His daughter, DW2, was in my view a truthful witness. In addition, it was never put to DW2 by the Prosecution that the car did not enter the city area.

66     The quality of the identification evidence and the explanation by the defence was sufficient for me to conclude that a reasonable doubt had be raised as to whether the Accused had driven SBU1881H through the junction at 1827 hrs on 20 November 2017 and in doing so, failed to conform with the traffic red light signal. I adjudged that a conviction in this particular case would not be safe.

67     All considered, I therefore found the Accused **_not guilty and acquitted him of the charge_**.

68     The Prosecution, being dissatisfied with my order of acquittal, has now appealed against it.

69     It leaves me to thank ASP Kelvin Lee and Mr Kalidass for their assistance and the work and effort that they have put into this matter.

70     As a form of postscript, I would highlight that this matter began its’ journey through the court system _via_ the night courts. It took some 2 years for this matter to come to trial, a very long time by any standards, let alone relatively minor nature of the offence. By this time, not only will memories fade, but important evidence such as video camera footage (from the LTA and police), cash card transaction records may no longer be available. If one were available, it would have put to bed any issues in this case. Perhaps it has reached a time that police officers who are on static station duty, like PW3, begin using video equipment to capture offending vehicles on video as a matter of course, if this is not already the case. This is already very widely used. For example, LTA enforcement officers are already use video cameras to capture footage of vehicles that enter the bus lanes during restricted hours. This would certainly assist all parties involved and would lead to a speedier resolution for such cases.
