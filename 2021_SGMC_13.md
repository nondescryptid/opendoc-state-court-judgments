### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The Accused, Mr Parmar Arun, a 50 year-old Singapore Permanent Resident claimed trial to a charge of voluntarily causing hurt to Mr Ding Hock Ming (“the Victim”) by punching him about five to ten times on the right side of his face, an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). Before the commencement of the trial, his Defence Counsel Mr Wilson Foo discharged himself. As such, the Accused conducted the trial in person.

2       The alleged incident took place on the 1st December 2018 at or about 2:00pm, at Level 4 male toilet of Far East Shopping Centre located at No 545 Orchard Road, Singapore. The Victim who was then 60 year old, suffered a contusion of about 3cm by 3cm over the right side of his face. At the material time, the Victim and the Accused were known to each other as they were business owners at Far East Shopping Centre. No other person was in the male toilet during the incident and hence it was essentially a case of one person’s word against another.

3       At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Upon delivering brief oral grounds for my decision to find him guilty, the Accused was convicted on 25 January 2021. On 5 February 2021 after a consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Accused’s plea in mitigation, he was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment. The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision filed an appeal against both his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.

4       I now set out the grounds of my decision in full. 

## The Charge

5       The proceeded charge in MCN 902426 - 2019 read as follows:

> …that you, on the 1st day of December 2018 at or about 2 pm, at Level 4 male toilet, of Far East Shopping Centre located at No 545 Orchard Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Ding Hock Ming, to wit, by punching the said Ding Hock Ming about 5 to 10 times on the right side of his face, thus causing contusion over the right side of the face about 3cm by 3cm, you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

## Issues to be determined

6       The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     whether the Prosecution had established all the essential elements of the charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt;

> (b)     whether the Accused could lawfully invoke the right of private defence under s 97(a) of the Penal Code;

> (c)     And if so, whether the Accused had acted within the bounds of the right of private defence.

## Undisputed facts

7       It was undisputed that the Victim and the Accused were employment agency owners dealing mainly with foreign domestic workers (FDWs) at the Far East Shopping Centre. The Accused's employment agency, ADP Consultants was located at Level 4 while the Victim's employment agency, SG Manpower was located at Level 5 of the shopping centre. Their offices were at opposite ends of an escalator that links the two floors. The Victim became acquainted with the Accused after his employment agency moved to Far East Shopping Centre about ten years ago.

8       It was further undisputed that they did not have a friendly relationship since end-2013 to 2014 as a result of various incidents between them. The Accused lodged at least ten police reports against the Victim. This is also evident from the Accused's personal log entitled “Stalking and Harassment Log” which listed various incidents involving the Victim and other persons. Between 2014 to 2017, the Accused had documented 67 entries, 28 of which involve the Victim. Notably, 11 of these entries relate to instances when the Victim had allegedly walked past the Accused's employment agency along the common corridor which is accessible to the public.

9       In addition, it was undisputed that shortly before the incident on 1 December 2018, the Accused had seen the Victim walking past his office on two occasions and was upset by this. He called the police on 24 November 2018 and 26 November 2018, complaining that the Victim had walked past his office.

10     It was unchallenged that on 1 December 2018, the Accused had seen the Victim walk past his office. The Victim had entered the male toilet at Level 4 before the Accused entered the same toilet. While they were both in the toilet, the Victim did not speak to the Accused and after using the toilet, the Victim tried to leave the toilet.

11     It was also unchallenged that as the Victim made his way to the entrance of the toilet, the Accused stood at the entrance of the toilet and confronted the Victim about the alleged stalking. The Victim then pushed his way past the Accused, made contact with the Accused's shoulder and soon after the Accused punched the Victim in his face multiple times.

12     The Accused had not sustained any injuries on the day of the incident or sought any medical treatment. He had not lodged any police report alleging that the Victim had attacked him in the toilet. It bears noting that the Accused is 6 feet (approximately 182cm) tall and 12 years younger than the Victim, who is approximately 174cm in height and slightly built.

## Elements of the charge

13     In order to establish its case on the charge under s 323 of the Penal Code, the Prosecution must prove the following:

> (a)     The Accused caused hurt to the Victim;

> (b)     The Victim suffered an injury namely, a 3cm by 3cm contusion over the right side of his face;

> (c)     The Accused intended to cause hurt to the Victim or that the Accused knew that hurt would likely result from his actions.

## The Prosecution's Case

14     It was the Prosecution's Case that the Accused and the Victim shared an acrimonious relationship that ultimately culminated in the confrontation on 1 December 2018 at the Level 4 male toilet and the subsequent assault. The Accused had long harboured deep suspicion towards the Victim, believing that he stalked him and ganged up with other competitors to bring his business down. Frustrated that his multiple police reports against the Victim appeared ineffective, the Accused finally decided to take matters into his own hands on 1 December 2018.

15     When he saw the Victim walking past his office that day, the Accused followed him to the toilet and confronted him while blocking the exit. Fearing for his safety, the Victim squeezed his way through to escape, only to be assaulted by the Accused immediately as he tried to leave the toilet. The assault on the Victim by the Accused only stopped when a male member of public separated them. According to the original investigating officer, Senior Staff Sergeant Sariah Binte Mohd Yusoff, the Victim was unable to provide information of any witnesses to this incident.

16     It was also the Prosecution's Case that the Accused's claims that he was acting in self-defence was baseless and ought to be wholly rejected. Even if any right to private defence had existed, the Accused had clearly exceeded the boundaries of such right by inflicting more harm than was necessary when he inflicted multiple punches on the right side of the Victim's face.

## The Defence's Case

17     In contrast, it is the Defence's case that prior to the incident on 1 December 2018, the Victim had intentionally and unlawfully stalked and harassed the Accused at his place of work. According to the Accused, the Victim would regularly use vulgarities, make racist remarks, use a middle finger, taunt the Accused to fight, disturb his office staff, unlawfully stalk the Accused at his office premises, in the carpark and at the stairwell. He alleged that the Victim also harassed the Accused on his own Facebook account and claimed that he incited hatred against the Accused within the premises of the shopping centre.

18     On 1 December 2018, the Accused saw the Victim walk past his office. The Accused then went to the toilet and was shocked to see the Victim in the toilet and thought that it was an ambush. As the Accused was about to leave the toilet, the Victim came up from behind him. As he sensed that the Victim was going to attack him, he turned around to face him.

19     When the Accused asked the Victim to stop walking past his office, the latter became angry. The Accused then saw something coming towards him and everything went black. He presumed that the Victim was about to headbutt him at his face and reacted in a completely involuntary manner, with his right hand coming out to defend himself against the attack. Thereafter, the Victim rammed his shoulder against the Accused's right shoulder and the Accused responded by punching the Victim more than once.

20     It was the Defence's Case that the Accused had acted entirely in self-defence throughout the incident. He also did not have his mobile phone with him at the material time, and therefore did not have recourse to local authorities.

## Assessment of the Victim’s Evidence

21     The main issues for my determination was whether the Accused had intentionally caused hurt to the Victim by punching the latter on his face or in the alternative, that he knew that hurt would likely result from his actions and whether he had lawfully exercised his right of private-defence. I was mindful that the Accused himself had admitted that he punched the Victim on his face more than once in the toilet at the material time but claimed that his acts were involuntary and in self-defence.

22     From the facts, it was clear that the Victim and the Accused had an acrimonious relationship that ultimately culminated in the confrontation on 1 December 2018. The Victim himself candidly gave accounts of past incidents between himself and the Accused. He testified that initially they were on neutral terms during their agency operations ten years ago but from 2013 they grew increasingly hostile towards each other.

#### Events leading to the incident

23     According to the Victim, two weeks prior to 1 December 2018 after he walked past the Accused’s office in search of an Indonesian FDW, the Accused tapped his shoulder from behind and demanded to know why he had walked past his office. The Accused then threatened the Victim “_don’t you ever dare walk past my office again or else”_. This account was not challenged by the Accused during his cross-examination of the Victim. The Victim was aggrieved by this threat against walking in a public area. In order to show that he was not intimidated, the Victim intentionally walked past the Accused’s office on the days that followed. Each time he did so, the Accused called for the Police. The Accused finally decided to take matters in his own hands on 1 December 2018 when he saw the Victim walk past his office.

#### The incident on 1 December 2018

24     The Victim testified that on 1 December 2018, he walked past the Accused’s office to go to the male toilet. As he was using the urinal, he suddenly noticed the Accused standing next to him while staring at him. Although he was surprised to see the Accused, the former ignored him. The Victim next went on to wash his hands and noticed that the Accused had followed suit at the next wash basin. He continued to ignore the Accused and when he tried to leave the toilet, the Accused walked ahead to the door and blocked his way. The Accused asked the Victim why he kept walking past his office. The Victim responded that it was a public place and that he could go wherever he liked.

25     Sensing that the Accused was going to be violent, the Victim tried to leave the toilet by pushing his way out past the Accused, making contact with the Accused’s right shoulder. He testified that when the Accused responded by hitting him from the back, the Victim turned around and tried to defend himself by putting both his hands up. The Accused then started hitting the Victim about five to ten times on his face. The assault ended when an Indian man separated them. The Victim immediately took the escalator to his floor and called for both the police and the ambulance. He spoke to the police for awhile and when the ambulance came, he followed them to the Singapore General Hospital. He gave evidence that he sustained a big bruise just below his eyes as a result of the assault.

#### Medical Evidence

26     In respect of the medical evidence in support of the injury _ie_ the 3cm by 3cm contusion or bruise suffered by the Victim, I was informed by the Prosecution that Dr Vetrivel Ramar, who prepared the Singapore General Hospital medical report has been in the United Kingdom since May 2019 and would not be returning to Singapore any time soon. The Prosecution submitted that in view of the current pandemic, it would be even more challenging for him to make travel arrangements to come down for the trial. Thus, the Prosecution applied to admit his original medical report that contained statements of relevant facts pursuant to s 32(j)(iii) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, Rev Ed 1997) as he is outside Singapore and it is not practicable to secure his attendance. In support of its application, the Prosecution had tendered email communication between the current investigating officer and the doctor showing the attempts made by the police to secure the doctor’s attendance as a witness.

27     The Accused objected to the admission of the medical report as part of the Prosecution’s case. He argued that the contents of the report was written by a doctor who was unable to verify or act as a witness at trial should be rescinded. He highlighted that there were two dates _ie_ 26 December 2018 and 1 December 2018 in the medical report, that there was no follow-up medical report and there were no photographs.

28     With respect, I found little merit in his argument on the two dates as it was evident from the report that one date reflected the date of the report while the second date was the date of the assault as well as the date the doctor had examined the Victim at the hospital. There was no follow-up medical report as the Victim had not received any follow-up medical treatment. Further, it is not uncommon for the unavailability of photographs for cases involving minor injuries. In the present case, I was satisfied that reasonable attempts had been made by the police to secure the doctor’s attendance. Since the report contained statements of relevant facts namely the victim’s injury, I admitted the medical report pursuant to s 32(j)(iii) of the Evidence Act as Dr Vetrivel Ramar is outside Singapore and it is not practicable to secure his attendance at the trial before me.

29     In my assessment of the Victim’s evidence, I found that the Victim had given clear, credible and convincing evidence of his interactions and past disputes with the Accused. I accepted his account of the assault in the male toilet on 1 December 2018 as consistent and corroborated by the objective evidence from his contemporaneous First Information Report as well as his medical report. In my view based on the surrounding circumstances of the case, the Accused was clearly the aggressor at the material time and not the Victim as alleged by the Accused.

30     I agreed with the Prosecution that as the Accused was frustrated that his numerous police reports were not effective against the Victim, he had decided to take matters in his own hands by confronting the Victim in the toilet. It was unchallenged that it was the Accused who first confronted and spoke to the Victim while they were in the toilet. The Accused then assaulted the Victim when the latter in attempting to escape from the confined space, pushed his way out past the Accused and made physical contact with the Accused’s right shoulder.

## Assessment of the Accused’s Evidence

31     The Accused testified that he is an arbitrator as well as an owner of an employment agency. His official residence is in Gelang Patah, Malaysia. The main focus of his defence was his claim that the Victim had intentionally and unlawfully stalked and harassed him at his office premises, in the carpark and at the stairwell. He alleged that the Victim had ganged up with other competitors in the building to bring his business down. According to him on 1 December 2018, he was working inside his office when he noticed the Victim walked past, stopped and peered through the window to stare. The Victim then disappeared.

32     According to him, few minutes later he entered the toilet and was shocked to find the Victim in the toilet. He proceeded to use the urinal and the Victim stared at him during the entire time. The Accused felt uncomfortable and sensed that something was not quite right. The Victim then walked behind him and headed to the wash basin. He followed suit and found the Victim staring and glaring at him. As he was leaving the toilet, the Victim came up from behind him. As such, he turned around to find out what the Victim was trying to do. He felt that the Victim was going to attack him as there was a long history of harassment activities.

33     According to him, the police were called several times previously and the Victim had been warned to stop the harassment activities going on past the office. The Victim had been cautioned to stay away from the Accused’s office and to keep to his floor. The Accused was of the view that the Victim was intent on causing trouble and as such told him to stop his unlawful stalking past his office. He testified that the Victim became very angry and the Accused’s recalled his own eye going black. There was something coming at him and he presumed the Victim was going to headbutt his face and reacted involuntarily. His right hand came out to defend himself against the attack which he believed to be a headbutt to the right side of his face. Two seconds later, the Victim rammed his arm against his right shoulder and believing he was under attack, he reacted in self-defence.

34     The Accused testified that he did not have any recourse to go down to the local authorities. He also did not have his hand phone with him at the material time. He was unable to recall the exact number of punches but it was more than one punch in order to protect himself. He highlighted that the Victim did not suffer any broken bones and only took one day off work. This demonstrated that he had employed minimal self-defence without the intention of harming the person. He further testified that even after the attack, the Victim had walked past his office on a few occasions.

35     From the evidence before me, I found the Accused to be a deeply suspicious man who did not get along with his other business competitors in the building. He was convinced that the Victim had not only stalked him but had ganged up with other competitors to bring his business down. This is evident from the regularity of his ‘999’ calls to the police and the numerous police reports lodged by him. He maintained a personal log with 67 entries since 2015, of incidents involving the Victim and other individuals, both known and unknown to him. In particular, 28 of the entries involved the Victim, of which 11 relate to instances when he had allegedly walked past the Accused’s office.

36     In my view, the Accused is an overly sensitive man as his reaction to the Victim’s act of merely walking past his office would often trigger an irrational reaction of him of immediately calling the Police. He saw himself as a victim of what he perceived to be the negative actions of other business owners at Far East Shopping Centre, particularly the Victim whom he believed stalked and ganged up with other competitors to bring his business down.

37     He claimed that the Victim would regularly use vulgarities, make racist remarks, use a middle finger, taunt the Accused to fight, disturb his office staff, unlawfully stalk the Accused at his office premises, in the carpark and at the stairwell. He further accused the Victim of inciting hatred against the Accused within the premises of the shopping centre. What is noteworthy is that despite his various claims against the Victim and his numerous police reports, there was no evidence of the police initiating any action against the Victim. Unlike the Victim, there was no evidence that the Accused had filed any Magistrate’s Complaint in respect of the alleged offences that he claimed were committed against him.

38     In the present case, I rejected his claim that he was shocked to see the Victim when he entered the toilet and had thought that it was an ambush. In any event, if he was of the view that it was an ambush, he could have immediately left the toilet to avoid any further interactions with the Victim as he was closer to the exit. Instead he had elected to remain in the toilet to confront the Victim regarding the alleged harassment activities going on past the office.

39     Based on the above, I rejected the Accused’s account of the incident in the toilet on 1 December 2018. I found his account of his eye going black and that there was something coming at him to be inherently incredible. It bears noting that the Accused himself testified that he only presumed the Victim was going to headbutt his face. In view of their height and age disparity, I agreed with the Prosecution that it was highly improbable that the Victim would headbutt the Accused in his face. His evidence that he had reacted involuntarily was clearly an attempt to downplay his culpability and to evade responsibility for his actions against the Victim. Instead I was of the view that it was the Accused who had intentionally confronted the Victim in the toilet and assaulted the Victim when the latter sought to escape from him by pushing past the Accused.

#### Intention to cause hurt

40     On the issue of the Accused's intention and knowledge at the material time, based on a careful and objective assessment of his conduct in punching the Victim multiple times, targeting a vulnerable portion of the Victim's body as well as all the surrounding circumstances, I found that this clearly established his intention to cause hurt to the Victim.

41     I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s intention to cause hurt to the Victim can be inferred from his use of force. He had resorted to punching the Victim more than once instead of simply pushing or shoving the Victim away when their shoulders came into contact. Even if the Accused had intended to defend himself against what he perceived to be an attack from the Victim, there was no necessity for him to punch the Victim several times in his face to subdue him, given his significant comparative advantage in size and age. I also agreed with the Prosecution that it was plain that the Accused had punched the Victim out of anger, intending to cause hurt to him. The Accused would have known that punching a person multiple times would cause hurt or that hurt would likely result from his actions.

42     Even taking the Accused’s account at its highest that punching was necessary, a _single_ punch would have sufficed. As highlighted by the Prosecution, his assault on the Victim was unrelenting until he was restrained by a male member of public. He had also aimed his punches at the Victim’s face which is a vulnerable part of the body. This resulted in the victim suffering a 3cm by 3cm contusion _ie_ a bruise on the right side of his face. Hence, it was clear from his actions that the Accused had intended to cause hurt to the Victim. At the very least, the Accused would have known that hurt would likely result from when an elderly individual is punched several times in the face.

#### Right to private defence

43     In addition, based on the evidence before me I also found that the right to private defence relied on by the Accused did not lawfully arise at any point in time during the incident on 1 December 2018. I agreed with the Prosecution that firstly, there was no reason for the Accused to reasonably apprehend that an offence was being or would be committed against his body.

44     The Accused claimed that he was defending himself as he perceived that the Victim was attempting to headbutt him and that the latter had subsequently rammed his shoulder into his body. It was clear that there was no basis for his belief as the Accused conceded that he had merely presumed that the Victim was going to do so and had not actually seen the Victim attempting to headbutt him. As for his claim that the Victim had rammed into him, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had exaggerated on the amount of force the Victim had actually used when he pushed past him to leave the toilet in order to justify his actions.

45     It was clear that the Victim was seeking to escape before the Accused turned violent on him inside the toilet after the Accused confronted him. It bears highlighting that it was the Accused who had blocked the Victim from exiting the toilet and confronted him in a threatening manner, causing the Victim to reasonably fear for his own safety. There was no reasonable apprehension of danger on the part of the Accused but rather his confrontation of the Victim resulted the latter apprehending danger and resorting to pushing past him to escape.

46     Even if the Accused had so reasonably apprehended that an offence was being or would be committed against his body, he had reasonable opportunities to seek recourse from the relevant public authorities but failed to do so. It was unchallenged that he was closer to the doorway and could have easily made a quick exit from the toilet. Having left the toilet, he could have also sought assistance from the members of public at the shopping centre to call for police assistance if he was indeed in any danger. Hence, on the facts of the present case I find that the Accused was not entitled to raise this as his defence to the charge.

47     After having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence, I am satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution has established all the essential elements of the charge in the present case. Consequently, I rejected the Accused's defence that it was the Victim who had ambushed him in the toilet and he had reacted in a completely involuntary manner as I found his evidence to be inherently incredible. I also find that given the relative sizes and built of the Victim and the Accused, it was also inconceivable that the Victim would initiate an attack against the Accused in the manner alleged by him. Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution had proven the charge under s 323 of the Penal Code against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I found him guilty and convicted him of the charge in MCN 902426-2019.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

48     The relevant prescribed penalty for the present charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment of up to two years, or with a fine which may extend to $5,000 or with both. For offences committed from 1 January 2020 onwards, the maximum term of imprisonment term has been since been increased to three years.

### Antecedents

49     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

50     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least two weeks’ imprisonment for the present case and had relied on the sentencing framework set out by the High Court in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“_Low Song Chye”_). This sentencing framework for s 323 cases is applicable for a first-time offender who had pleaded guilty.

51     It was submitted that the present case fell under Band 1 as low harm was caused. The Victim’s injury was minor as he sustained a 3cm by 3cm contusion on his face and was given five days of medical leave.

52     It was the Prosecution’s case that the custodial threshold had been crossed in this case due to the aggravating factors present:

> _Offence-specific factors_

> (a)     The Accused had punched the Victim multiple times (at least five to ten times) until he was restrained;

> (b)     The assault was directed at a vulnerable area (_ie_ the Victim’s face);

> (c)     Relative vulnerability due to his age and size – the Victim was 60 years’ old and approximately 174cm tall; the Accused was 48 years’ old, approximately 182cm tall, and was substantially larger in size than the victim.

> (d)     Incident took place in a confined space in a toilet, with the Accused blocking the Victim from escaping;

> (e)     Some degree of pre-meditation and deliberation – the Accused had one to two weeks before warned the Victim not to walk past his office again and issued an implicit threat “or else”. On the day of the incident the Accused had seen the Victim walking past his office and decided to follow him to the toilet and blocked the exit door, before proceeding to assault the victim;

> (f)     Some degree of public disturbance as the offence was committed in a shopping mall bustling with weekend human traffic.

> _Offender-specific factors_

> (g)     The Accused displayed a lack of remorse by maintaining throughout the trial that the Victim was the aggressor and he was merely acting in self-defence;

> (h)     The fact that the Accused claimed trial must also be factored into the sentence.

53     The Prosecution relied on three precedent cases that were dealt with after _Low Song Chye_ namely: _Public Prosecutor v Mohamad Faiza Bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 168</span> (“_Mohamad Faiza”)_, _Public Prosecutor v S Elamparithi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 67</span> (“_S Elamparithi”)_ and _Public Prosecutor v Stuart Boyd Mills_ MCN-901108-2019 and another (23 September 2019) (“_Stuart Boyd Mills”)_.

54     It was highlighted in _Mohamad Faiza_, the offender had punched the victim once on his right cheek. Thereafter the victim fell to the ground and the offender escaped. The offender who did not have any violent antecedents was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment. His sentence was affirmed on appeal. Next, in _S Elamparithi_, the victim had pushed the offender and the offender had slapped the victim three times on the left side of his face. The victim sustained soft tissue contusion and compensation was paid to the victim. The offender was initially sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment but the sentence was reduced to ten days’ imprisonment on appeal. Lastly, in _Stuart Boyd Mills_, the offender got angry with the victim and punched him on the right side of his face. This caused the victim to fall and his spectacles to break. The victim felt pain on the right side of his face and swelling around his right eye region. The victim made voluntary compensation of $2,000 to the victim. The offender was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment.

55     It was the Prosecution’s case that in light of these precedents, two weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate for the present case. The sentence would commensurate with the case of _Mohamad Faiza_ even though in that case the offender had only punched the victim once. In the present case, the Accused had punched the Victim at least five to ten times and there were also aggravating factors as set out earlier. For the cases of _S Elamparithi_ and _Stuart Boyd Mills_, compensation was paid to the victims whereas this was not a mitigating factor on the Accused’s part. It was submitted that there was a need for a higher sentence than these two cases as the Accused’s acts were more aggravated as he punched the Victim at least five to ten times.

### Mitigation

56     In his written plea in mitigation, the Accused once again set out his defence to the charge and made references to matters that were not part of the evidence properly admitted at trial. He maintained that he had not reciprocated any of the harassment activities perpetuated by the Victim. He alleged that on 1 December 2018, he was assaulted by the Victim in the toilet.

57     The Accused has two children aged 6 and 7 years old and a wife who resides in Malaysia. According to him, the fact that his wife and children are fully dependent on him did not deter the Victim's harassment activities. He claimed that his wife was harassed online by the Victim and one Zainal. Due to the sustained harassment, he decided to keep his family in Malaysia for their protection and safety.

58     He lamented that he was kept in the Pre-Trial Conference stage for a prolonged period of time _ie_ for over a year during a Covid 19 Circuit Breaker period and claimed that no information being provided to him. He highlighted that the decision to go to trial was initiated by his then Defence Counsel in view of expediting the process since this right to self-defence did arise on the 1 December 2018.

59     He submitted that the Prosecution had not provide any witnesses of fact to substantiate the content in the Magistrate’s Complaint lodged by the Victim and that his right to self-defence had not been taken into account despite stating this in his statements to the investigating officer.

60     The Accused requested for leniency as he had demonstrated that he does seek the assistance from the local authorities. Unfortunately he was in a situation where he had no option but to protect himself from an imminent assault against him in a confined area.

61     According to him, he has grounds to believe that the harassment activities are motivated by business jealousy and the intention was to harass him so that he would relocate his office premises out of Far East Shopping Centre.

62     The Accused highlighted that he was untraced and regularly reports incidents at Far East Shopping Centre to the local authorities, building management and security.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Sentencing principles

63     In my consideration of the appropriate sentence, I was bound by the sentencing framework for offences under s 323 of the Penal Code as set out by the High Court in _Low Song Chye_. I was mindful that this framework is intended to apply to a first-time offender who had pleaded guilty. An appropriate uplift would be applied in cases where the offender elects to claim trial as the offender is not entitled to the usual sentencing discount afforded to an offender who pleads guilty. I also considered and was guided by the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution, particularly the post-_Low Song Chye_ reported cases in _Mohamad Faiza_ and _S Elamparithi_.

64     After a careful consideration of the facts before me, I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case falls under Band 1 low harm category of the sentencing framework as set out at \[50\] above. The Victim had suffered a 3cm by 3cm contusion over the right side of his face. As such, the hurt suffered was considered as minor. The indicative sentencing range for offences under Band 1 are fines or short custodial term of up to four weeks.

65     I next considered the appropriate type of sentence to be imposed namely whether a fine was appropriate or whether the factual matrix called for the imposition of a custodial sentence. The Prosecution’s position was that the custodial threshold has been crossed in the present case in light of the offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating factors present in this case. In contrast, the Accused offered no mitigating factors for my consideration save for the fact that he was a first offender. He remained unremorseful for his actions even during his plea in mitigation and continued to assert the defence raised at trial.

66     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the offence-specific aggravating factors present were as follows:

> (a)     The Accused inflicted multiple punches on the Victim and only stopped when he was restrained by a member of public;

> (b)     The Accused had assaulted the Victim at a vulnerable area of the body namely the Victim's face;

> (c)     The relative vulnerability of the Victim due to the differences in age and size – at the material time the Victim was 60 years' old and approximately 174cm tall while the Accused was 48 years' old, approximately 182cm tall and is substantially larger in size than the victim;

> (d)     The incident had taken place in a confined space of a male toilet, with the Accused blocking the Victim from escaping;

> (e)     There was some degree of pre-meditation and deliberation. The Accused had warned the Victim not to walk past his office. On the day of the incident, the Accused had seen the Victim walking past his office, and decided to follow him to the toilet and blocked the exit door, before proceeding to assault the Victim;

> (f)     there was some degree of public disturbance as the offence was committed in a shopping mall bustling with weekend human traffic.

67     In addition, I found that the offender-specific factors were:

> (a)     the Accused's lack of remorse throughout the trial and even in his plea in mitigation. He continued to maintain his defence to the charge and insisted that he was the actual victim of the incident on 1 December 2018;

> (b)     the fact that the Accused had claimed trial. The _Low Song Chye_ sentencing framework is intended for a first offender who had pleaded guilty. Thus an uplift in sentence was warranted.

## Conclusion

68     Based on the above factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that the custodial threshold had been crossed and that a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment was just and appropriate. In my view such sentence was warranted as both a specific deterrence to the Accused from repeating the unlawful use of violence on others as well as general deterrence to other like-minded offenders. In the present case, the Accused had reacted disproportionately and resorted to violence against the Victim who had refused to be intimidated by the Accused’s threats against walking past his office. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for MCN902426-2019.
