Contempt of court – Civil contempt

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/CJTB 1/2021.\]

17 November 2021

### District Judge Jasbendar Kaur:

## Introduction

1       Summons No. 1433 of 2021 in PHA OS No. 70002 of 2020 was taken out on 8 April 2021 by the Applicant, Tokio Marine Life Insurance Singapore Ltd, for an Order of Committal against the Respondent, Tay Tiang Choo for failing to comply with two court orders:

> (i)     DC/ORC/70002/2020: an interim stop publication order and an interim notification order granted under sections 16A and 16B of the Protection from Harassment Act (Act 14 of 2014) (the “POHA”) on 2 November 2020 (the “Interim Order”); and

> (ii)     DC/ORC 652/2021: a stop publication order and a correction order granted under sections 15A and 15B of the POHA on 10 February 2020 (the “Final Order”).

2       These orders concern the application made by the Applicant to stop the Respondent and her representatives and/or agents from publishing false statements of fact in relation to the Applicant and to publish a correction notice on her Facebook and Tik Tok accounts and to forward the correction notice to the persons and entities to whom the Respondent had forwarded the false statements of fact.

3       Pursuant to the leave granted by the court on 31 March 2021 (DC/ SUM 1164/2021), the Applicant filed an application for the Respondent to be committed to prison or fined for her contempt of court. On 19 July 2021, I found the Respondent guilty of contempt of court as I was satisfied beyond reason doubt that she had (i) repeatedly and deliberately refused to comply with the Order of Court DC/ORC/70002/2020 and (ii) deliberately refused to fully comply with the Order of Court DC/ORC 652/2021 and I sentenced her to 4 weeks’ imprisonment. The Respondent appealed against my decision on 2 August 2021

## Background Facts

4       The Respondent had purchased two life policies with the Applicant - TM Retirement (LP) Policy No. XXX (TM R Policy) and the TM FlexiAssurance Policy No. XXX (TM FA Policy). A dispute between the parties arose in May 2018 when the Respondent applied to purchase the TM FA Policy through her agent. When the application was made, an internal written warning was triggered to alert her agent that her TM R Policy that she had purchased in 2012 had been “discontinued” when in fact it was still in-force, but the Non-Forfeiture Loan option had been activated against the policy’s surrender value due to missed premium payments. When this information was shared with the Respondent, she became upset, and she sought clarification in May 2018. The Applicant’s staff did attempt to assure the Respondent that the said policy was still in force and that the information in the internal alert was inaccurate, but the explanations were not accepted by the Respondent.

5       She then sent a letter to Tokio Marine Holdings Inc in Japan, wherein she accused the Applicant of committing “scam and fraud and in cheating my money by discontinued my policy” and she demanded “Compensation equivalent to paid premium till today” to be paid to her, failing which she would report the matter to the police. She also alleged that there were other victims of this scam and fraud. A detailed explanation with supporting documents was issued by the Applicant on 26 June 2018 but the Respondent was not appeased, and she proceeded to forward her complaint to the President of the Applicant’s Head Office, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co Ltd on 11 July 2018. A copy of this letter was also forwarded to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the “MAS”), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Minister Indrani Rajah and Ms Amelia Ang from M/s Lee & Lee.

6       On 13 July 2018, the Applicant’s staff met the Respondent together with a third party at Amara Hotel. Parties managed to resolve the matter and the Applicant issued a letter dated 17 July 2018 to document the terms of the settlement. The said letter revealed that the Applicant had agreed to issue an apology for their service lapse and had offered shopping vouchers worth $890 as a token of appreciation and a gesture of goodwill. The letter also revealed that the Respondent had initially demanded $3000 as compensation.

7       Things were quiet until June 2019 when the Respondent learnt that her TM FA Policy that was issued on 2 April 2018 had lapsed due to repeated failed GIRO deductions from her DBS bank account in March and April 2019 due to there being insufficient funds. The Respondent insisted that the cancellation of the policy was erroneous as her bank account had sufficient funds during the relevant period and that the policy should not have been cancelled without first informing her. She claimed that she did not receive the lapse notification and that she only learnt of the cancellation when she made enquiries on her own. She then proceeded to demand a full refund of the premiums that she had paid for this policy as compensation. The Applicant rejected the Respondent’s request and countered that the Respondent was notified of all the unsuccessful deductions and the automatic lapse. They offered to reinstate her policy upon payment of the unpaid premiums.

8       The Respondent rejected the Applicant’s response. A meeting was then arranged on 23 August 2019 to explain to her in person why the TM FA Policy had lapsed and thereafter on 26 August 2019, a written explanation was issued to her to reiterate the Application’s position and the reinstatement option.

9       On 25 December 2019, the Respondent sent a complaint email to the General Manager and Head of Compliance of Tokio Marine Inc in Japan, which was copied to Minister Indranee Rajah, the MAS and the Corrupt Practices Investigations Bureau (the “CPIB”). In this email, she called the Applicant’s staff “unethical, irresponsible, and unprofessional”. She also revealed that she had reported to her Member of Parliament and the MAS about the erroneous lapse action and the wrongful disclosure of her personal information by DBS to the Applicant and to the CPIB about the Applicant’s “irregular practices”. She demanded full compensation because of the “ruckuses that she had undergone” and the turmoil that she suffered and made it clear that she was not a “No Action Talk Only (NATO) woman”.

10     On 3 June 2020, she sent a letter to the Prime Minister’s Office (copied to Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Kiat, Minister Indranee Rajah and the MAS) wherein she alleged that the Applicant had obtained information from her personal bank account through an “illegal method”, and she further alleged that the Applicant “is playing a wait out game to bleed my policy out until it cannot sustain the premium anymore.” On 25 July 2020, she wrote to Tokio Marine Holdings Inc in Japan again, alleging that the Applicant was “like a scam company” and that she had been “scammed 99.999%”. She demanded $1 million compensation and threatened to go to the press and to publicise the matter on social media if she is not appropriately compensated. Thereafter, she issued the following emails:

> (i)     On 3 August 2020, her representative sent an email to Mr Taro Aso, Minister of Finance and Minister of State for Financial Services and the Financial Services Agency of Japan (copied to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Kiat, Minister Indranee Rajah, Minister Lawrence Wong, the MAS and the CPIB). In this letter, she repeated her allegations and demanded $1 million as compensation for the Applicant’s “incompetent staff, negligence, unethical twisting of events”. The Applicant responded on 8 August 2020 and demanded that she refrain from making public remarks or posting comments or statements that may be defamatory in nature to harass the Applicant; and

> (ii)     On 25 August 2020, she sent an email to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Kiat and to the MAS alleging that the Applicant had acted “unprofessionally”, and that she is “dun cooperating…regardless they send me duress letter dated 18 Aug 2020”.

11     Thereafter, the Respondent uploaded various posts on her Facebook and Tik Tok accounts alleging that she had been cheated and defrauded by the Applicant.

12     On 30 October 2020, the Applicant filed the Ex Parte Summons under sections 15A, 15B, 16A and 16B of the POHA to stop the Respondent and her representatives and/or agents from publishing the following statements until the final determination on the basis that these were false statements of fact (the “Relevant Statements”):

> (i)     “The Applicant had wrongfully discontinued the Respondent’s insurance policies with the Applicant;

> (ii)     The Applicant had scammed or cheated the Respondent;

> (iii)     The Applicant had actively been lying to and misleading its customers regarding their policies, or otherwise being nonresponsive to customers’ inquiries or concerns about their policies;

> (iv)     The Applicant is unprofessional and disrespectful to the Respondent and refuses to admit its mistakes;

> (v)     The Applicant had accessed the personal data and sensitive financial information of the Respondent without proper authorisation;

> (vi)     The Applicant had committed commercial fraud;

> (vii)     The Applicant was engaged in corrupt practices;

> (viii)    The Applicant had sought to cover its dishonest and sharp business practices by offering money to customers or placing customers under duress;

> (ix)     The Applicant will cancel their customers’ policies without justification or warning; and

> (x)     The Applicant is “bleeding out” the Respondent’s policy until she is no longer able to pay the premium.”

They also sought an interim notification order to require the Respondent to publish a notification on her Facebook and Tik Tok accounts and to forward the same notification to the persons and entities to whom the Respondent had forwarded the Relevant Statements.

13     On 2 November 2020, the court found that there was prima facie evidence that the Relevant Statements were false statements of fact. The interim stop publication and interim notification order (the Interim Order) was granted which required the Respondent to comply within 24 hours of it being served on her. The order contained a penal notice that provided that should she disobey the order, “you will be liable to process of execution for the purpose of compelling you to obey this order. In addition, you may be guilty of contempt of court.”[^1].

14     The Respondent failed to comply with the Interim Order, and she had in fact reposted the Relevant Statements on her Facebook account on three separate occasions after the Interim Order was issued (on 30 November, 1 December and 16 December 2020) and she had also encouraged others to like and share the posts.

15     The matter proceeded for hearing on 4 January 2021. The Respondent did not deny posting and reposting the offending posts on her Facebook and Tik Tok accounts and sending the emails and letters containing the Relevant Statements to the various parties. However, she opposed the application and argued that all the statements were true, and she insisted that she had the right to make and share the Relevant Statements as she was publishing the truth. Having considered the evidence adduced and the submissions by the Applicant’s counsel, I decided that the Applicant had managed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the Relevant Statements were false and that it would be just and equitable to grant a stop publication order under section 15A of the POHA and a correction order under section 16A of the same (the Final Order) that required the Respondent and her representatives and/or agents to:

> (a)     stop publishing the Relevant Statements and not to publish any substantially similar statement with immediate effect, and the Respondent had remove the posts containing the Relevant Statements on her Facebook account (accessible at https://www.facebook.com/XXX) and Tik Tok account (User ID: @hyperwindXXX) within 24 hours of issuance of the order (pursuant to section 15A of the POHA); and

> (b)     publish a correction notice on her Facebook Tik Tok accounts by 3 March 2021, and to send an email containing the correction notice to each of the persons and entities at their email addresses (pursuant to section 15B of the POHA).

16     The Respondent failed to comply with the Final Order that was granted on 10 February 2021 that had the same penal notice. In fact, she republished three posts on her Facebook account on 10 February 2021 after receiving judgment and she had asked her followers to like and share the said posts. According to her, it was only after the Final Order was served on her on 22 and 23 February 2021 that she had considered complying with the stop publication order and had taken down the posts in March 2021[^2].

17     On 16 March 2021, the Applicant filed the Summons for Leave to Commence Committal Proceedings (DC/SUM 1164/2021) on the following grounds:

> (a)     The Respondent had repeatedly and deliberately refused to comply with Order of Court DC/ORC/70002/2020 dated 2 November 2020; and

> (b)     The Respondent has repeatedly and deliberately refused to fully comply with Order of Court DC/ORC 652/2021 dated 10 February 2021.

18     On 31 March 2021, leave was granted under O 52 r 2 of the Rules of Court (hereinafter referred to as (the “ROC”) as there was prima facie evidence of contempt (DC/ORC 1206/2021). The Summons for Committal Proceedings was filed on 8 April 2021 together with the statement made pursuant to O 52 r 2(2) of the ROC, and the supporting affidavit of Yong Yi Xiang dated 16 March 2021. The application was granted, and the Summons and the supporting documents were served through email on the Respondent on 14 April 2021.[^3]

19     After the committal papers were served on the Respondent, she took further steps to purge her contempt and the offensive posts were completely removed from her social media accounts by 1 June 2021:

> (a)     She removed the Tik Tok video containing the offensive statements before the pre-trial conference on 19 May 2021; and

> (b)     She removed an image of the offensive posts in one of the photo albums on her Facebook account that remained viewable by all visitors after 19 May 2021.

20     The Respondent was granted legal aid pursuant to section 8 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act, Cap 160 on 27 April 2021 and Mr Chey Cheng Chwen Anthony was appointed to represent her. [^4] On 1 June 2012, Mr Chey filed her Affidavit and the following “Further Hearing Request” on her behalf:

> Pursuant to the directions given by the Judge during the JPTC on 19 May 2021, we write to inform the Court that the Respondent has given instructions that she has taken down the Facebook image as per the Judge's direction but will not issue the correction notices for the reasons set out in her affidavit which is filed today. Further, the Respondent confirms that she will proceed with the committal proceedings hearing fixed for 17 June 2021 at 9.30am.

21     The parties appeared before me for the Committal Proceedings on 17 June 2021 with the Respondent being represented by Mr Chey. To afford her full opportunity to refute the allegations of non-compliance, the Respondent was permitted to give oral evidence to respond to the allegations.[^5] During her testimony, she admitted that she did not make any effort to comply with the Interim Order and that she only decided to partially purge her contempt after 25 February 2021.

22     After considering all the evidence, including hearing the Respondent and the submissions by both parties, I decided that the Applicant had managed to prove beyond reasonable doubt[^6] that the Respondent had breached the Interim and Final Orders with the full knowledge of her legal obligations under the said orders. It was also my finding that the Respondent’s conduct did not entitle her to the defence under section 21 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (No. 19 of 2016) since her own evidence showed that her failure and/or refusal to comply with the two Orders was not “wholly or substantially attributable to an honest and reasonable failure by that person, at the relevant time, to understand an obligation imposed on the person…”[^7] On 19 July 2021, I found the Respondent guilty of contempt of court for (i) repeatedly and deliberately refusing to comply with Order of Court DC/ORC/70002/2020 dated 2 November 2020 and (ii) deliberately refusing to fully comply with Order of Court DC/ORC 652/2021 dated 10 February 2021. After hearing sentencing submissions from the parties, I ordered the Respondent to stand committed to prison to be there imprisoned for 4 weeks.

23     The matter was then adjourned for Mr Chey to take instructions on whether the Respondent was willing to purge the contempt and to seek a suspension of the execution of the Order of Committal under O52 r6 for this purpose. On 30 July 2021, the Respondent appeared before me without a counsel as Mr Chey ceased acting as her solicitor upon the cancellation of the provisional grant of aid. She informed the court that she was not willing to purge her contempt– “I will never do it. It means that I lied in Court and I will charged for doing that.” She also indicated that she would be lodging an appeal against her conviction and I proceeded to explain to her that the appeal proceedings would not automatically operate to stay the execution proceedings and that she may wish to apply to stay the proceedings after filing her appeal. The Applicant lodged her appeal on 2 August 2021 but failed to file an application to stay the execution of the Order of Committal.

24     The Applicant proceeded to file the Order of Committal dated 19 July 2021 on 6 August 2021 (DC/ORC 2811/2021). On 17 August 201, the Applicant filed the Warrant (Order) for Committal directing that the Respondent be apprehended and be conveyed to prison (DC/WFC 2/2021) and sought a suitable date to execute the Warrant for Committal. The Applicant was informed on 19 September 2021 and 19 October 2021 that the execution could not be scheduled because of the regulations set out in COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 and the associated public health concerns. The Warrant of Committal is yet to be executed.

## The Appeal

25     The Respondent filed an appeal to the General Division of the High Court against the “whole decision” made by the Court on 19 July 2021 on the following grounds:

> (i)     “The Appellant is in dilemma to comply the Court Order due to plight in redress for claim in contradiction.

> (ii)     By complying to Court Order, the Appellant is breaking in conscious to tell lie to the public. There is no professionalism in service in deal as evidence in the apologised letters to the Ap(p)ellant in black and white as evidence and in the erroneous in system making the Ap(p)ellant suffers great losses in maturity in number of years invested in insurance. Vouchers given to the Ap(p)ellant and to make up premier payment only to deal with instead of looking into the maturity years of fruitage in compensations.

> (iii)     The Ap(p)ellant felt cheated and being scammed of her hard earned money in great losses.

> (iv)     The Appellant felt that Tokio Marine Life Insurance Singapore Limited can continue to do the same thing to the public having different dates in deduction then discontinue the policy, no need to pay up the maturity in the policy in the upper hand in the same tactics.

> (v)     Appellant pleads to review in sentencing jail term to an elderly not learned in law not doing correction order prepared by Tokio Marine Life Insurance Singapore Ltd has exceeded the punishment as she is not committing criminated crime act.

> (vi)     The Appellant pleads the High Court to review the sentencing in discretion made by the State Court Judge as it involves the public interest.”

26     Although the Respondent indicated that she is appealing against the “whole decision” made by the court, it can be inferred from the grounds that she is not appealing against the substantive finding that she is guilty of contempt and that she is mainly unhappy with the sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment. This inference is supported by the fact that she did not deny the acts of non-compliance during the Committal Proceedings and had only attempted to justify why she did not or could comply with the court orders.

27     Therefore, these grounds will focus on my reasons for imposing the sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment and why this is an appropriate and fair sentence on the facts of this case.

## Court’s Sentencing Approach and Decision

28     The issue that I had consider was whether the facts of this case justified and required the imposition of a custodial sentence since a committal order should only considered as a measure of last resort for acts of contempt (see **_Lee Shieh-Peen Clement and Anor v Ho Chin Nguang and Ors_** <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 801</span> at \[49\]). Having considered all the evidence, I decided that the custodial threshold was crossed in this case because of the serious nature of the contempt.

### Why it was necessary to impose a custodial sentence?

29     The Respondent’s counsel submitted that pecuniary punishment would suffice in this case since the Respondent’s non-compliance was not done out of spite. She decided not to comply with the Interim Order as she had believed that she had a “decent case” and being an interim order, she assumed that she could “continue what she was doing until adjudication” [^8]. In relation to the Final Order, he emphasised that she had taken remedial action when it became clear to her that she had “lost” and submitted that the “_mens rea_ element” was no longer present after 25 February 2021 or that if it did, it involved “a very low tier _mens rea_ element”.

30     He referred to **_Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd_** <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 73</span>[^9] and **_STX Corp v Jason Surjana Tanuwidjaja and Ors_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 45</span>[^10] to argue that the sentence to be meted out in this case “need not be a definite custodial sentence, it can be a fine” as the court has the discretion to impose a high fine.[^11]

31     On the other hand, the Applicant’s counsel submitted that a custodial sentence was warranted as there were several aggravating factors in this case and the sentence imposed by the court should be sufficiently lengthy to compel compliance on the part of the Respondent. In support of this submission, they referred to the sentencing principles laid down in **_Sembcorp Marine Ltd v Aurol Anthony Sabastian_** <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 245</span> (“**_Sembcorp Maine_**”) at \[68\] and in **_Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1</span> (“**_Mok Kah Hong_**”) at \[104\] and argued that a custodial sentence should be imposed for the following reasons:

> (a)     she had wilfully disregarded the court orders just to “spitefully cause continuing damage to the Applicant by ensuring that her false statements are not corrected”;

> (b)     she “had acted in knowing and disregard of the Interim ORC and Final ORC”;

> (c)     she was not remorseful and had wilfully refused to accept the court’s findings that the Relevant Statements were false;

> (d)     her “contempt is continuing and egregious”;

> (e)     the Respondent was given numerous opportunities to purge her contempt; and

> (f)     a high fine would not be an “effective deterrent” as her reasons for non-compliance were non-pecuniary and not for any financial gain.

32     In determining the appropriate sentence, I considered the sentencing factors identified in **_Crystal Mews Ltd v Metterick_** \[2006\] EWHC 3087 (Ch) for cases involving contempt by disobedience, which the Court of Appeal in **_Mok Kah Hong_** at \[104\] had observed was a useful sentencing framework – “Although these factors were not intended as sentencing guidelines, we are of the view that they do provide a useful framework for the courts to analyse the relevant facts in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence.” This observation was reiterated in **_Tay Kar Oon v Tahir_** <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 31</span> at \[55\]:

> “55    In _Mok Kah Hong_ (\[29\] _supra_), this court referred (at \[104\]) to the decision of Lawrence Collins J in _Crystal Mews Ltd v Metterick_ \[2006\] EWHC 3087 (Ch), where Collins J identified (at \[13\]) a number of factors which would be relevant to the issue of sentencing. These factors included (a) whether the applicant had been prejudiced by virtue of the contempt and whether the contempt was capable of remedy; (b) the extent to which the contemnor acted under pressure; (c) whether the breach of the order was deliberate or unintentional; (d) the degree of culpability; (e) whether the contemnor had been placed in breach of the order by reason of the conduct of others; (f) whether the contemnor appreciated the seriousness of the deliberate breach; and (g) whether the contemnor had co-operated. Although these factors are not exhaustive, they provide a useful framework for analysis.”

33     Taking guidance from this framework, I considered the following factors to determine the sentence:

> (a)     Degree of continuity in the contemptuous conduct;

> (b)     Motive and intention; i.e.; whether the non-compliance was intentional or fraudulent and if the Respondent had appreciated the seriousness of her disobedience;

> (c)     Evidence of any genuine or substantive attempts on the part of the Respondent to comply with the judgment or order; and

> (d)     Impact of the contemptuous conduct; whether the Applicant had been prejudiced and whether the prejudice is capable of remedy.

34     Having analysed the facts with reference to the abovementioned factors, I decided that it was appropriate and necessary to impose a custodial sentence. My reasons are as follows:

#### Reason 1: The Respondent’s disobedience was persistent and deliberate involving repeated breaches

35     It was not in dispute that her non-compliance was persistent and currently, continuing. She disobeyed the Interim Order until final judgment was given, making her contemptuous conduct irreversible. In relation to the Final Order, she made no effort to comply with the order until March 2021 and even then, she only partially purged her contempt by taking down the offensive posts on her Facebook account and the offensive video on her Tik Tok account. She categorically refused to publish the correction notice on her social media accounts and forward the correction notice to the persons and entities that had received her letters or emails containing the Relevant Statements, proclaiming that she could not be compelled to comply in any circumstances – “Like what I have said many times, Ma’am, even if you kill me, I will not do this correction order or correction notice.”[^12]

36     The Respondent’s own evidence revealed that the disobedience was deliberate as she allegedly did it to broadcast the “truth” to prevent other policy holders or potential clients from being “scammed”. In my view, this was not her main motivation. The main reason she refused to comply with the Interim Order was because she wanted to continue embarrassing and pressurising the Applicant to accede to her demand for compensation. She was also not willing to accept anything other her own “truth” and she admitted as much during the Committal Proceedings when she stated that she was only willing to comply with the court order if it suited her - “Like what I had been emphasising, I do whatever that I can but whatever that I am not able to do, I will not do it.”[^13]

37     The reasons for her unwillingness to obey the court orders also revealed that her conduct was deliberate. When she was queried during the Committal Proceedings why she did not comply with the Interim Order, she gave excuses like she was looking for a lawyer, that she had believed that she had not “entirely lost” as the Judge conducting the pre-trial conference had informed her that her stand was “justified”[^14] or that it was too much trouble to take down the offensive posts pending the hearing because “I were to upload it and then take it down, wouldn’t it be a waste of effort.”[^15] She had also claimed that she did not comply with the Interim Order as “I wanted to wait until the last or final Court Order then I would do it.”[^16] Yet, the first thing she did after the Final Order was issued was to republish the offensive posts three times on her Facebook account and she encouraged visitors to her Facebook account to like and share the posts. She did this even though the court had explained the terms of the Final Order to her on 10 February 2021 and had informed her that she was required to comply.

38     Further, she did not take any action to comply with the Final Order until it was served on her and even then, she refused to fully comply with it. Although her counsel suggested that she decided to take down the posts when she realised that she had “lost”, her evidence during the Committal Proceedings and her grounds of appeal suggested that she still believes that the orders were wrong. Therefore, it was likely that she had taken down the posts not because she accepted the decision of the court but because she believed that this would support her plan to vary her obligation under the Final Order to publish and issue the correction notice. In order words, the Respondent continued to “do whatever that I can but whatever that I am not able to do, I will not do it.” and based on this, it was clear that a fine would have been inadequate. As observed by the High Court in **_OCM Opportunities Fund II and Ors v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and Ors_** <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 81</span> at \[37\] (“**_OCM Opportunities_**”), a custodial sentence is necessary when “there was no other effective means to ensure compliance.”, I can to

#### Reason 2: Respondent chose to not comply appreciating the seriousness of her disobedience

39     The Respondent had suggested that she may not have appreciated the seriousness of the situation or the consequences of her non-compliance as she did not read the contents of the Interim Order and the demand letters issued by the Applicant’s lawyers - “I just run---run through them once ---had a flick through them.”[^17] She further claimed that she did not read the penal clause in the orders that had cautioned that any disobedience of the order would make her liable “to process of execution for the purpose of compelling you to obey this order. In addition, you may be guilty of contempt of court.” The Respondent’s evidence, however, showed that she had committed the breaches intentionally and with the full knowledge of the serious consequences that may follow.

40     First, when she was questioned on whether she had read the contents of the orders, including the penal clause, she gave evasive answers before admitting that she had read the orders[^18]:

| 

Court:

 | 

Yes, but you read it?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I did but I did not really understand it.…

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. I’m going to ask you again. Did you or did you not read the Interim Order that was served on you?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I ran through it once.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay, “I ran through it once”. That will be your evidence. Did you read the Final Order once it was served on you?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

So, when I received it, it was around 23rd or 24th February, it was when I was going to appeal. And then I was told---I was told by---so, I was told by people from the State Courts that it had passed the timeline for the appeal.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, my question still remains unanswered. Did you or did you not read the Final Order?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I had read it but I did not know what to do.

Basically, her prevarications suggested that she was unwilling to admit that she had read and understood the contents of the orders and that she had disobeyed the orders knowing and appreciating the consequences.

41     Second, even if for whatever reason she did not manage to read and understand the contents of the orders, she would have been fully apprised of the potential consequences after Mr Chey was appointed to represent her in the Committal Proceedings. Which meant that leading up to the proceedings on 17 June and 19 July 2021. she had continued to disobey the Final Order knowing that she was in contempt of court.

42     Third, the Court had explained to the Respondent on several occasions the potential legal consequences that she may face should she continue to disobey the court orders and each time she had responded to say that she could not and/or would not comply. The Applicant’s lawyers had also issued numerous demand letters to compel the Respondent to comply. Yet, no effort was made by her to purge the contempt until March 2021.

43     Further, she had on several occasions portrayed herself as an old and helpless litigant with poor eyesight who was incapable of fully appreciating the import of the proceedings or her legal obligations under the orders. During the Committal Proceedings, she suggested that that she was quite lost and did not know what do after reading that Final Order. The fact is that the order is not difficult to understand. It only required the Respondent to do three things – (i) stop publishing the statements that were declared to be false, (ii) publish and issue the correction notice and (iii) pay costs to the Applicant. Based on her employment history that she had worked as a public auditor and an insurance agent from 1985 to 2003, reading a 3-page court order would not have been a challenging exercise[^19].

44     In any event, her alleged sense of helplessness was belied by her conduct in the court proceedings. The Bundle of Exhibits that she had tendered during the substantive hearing in January 2021 was adequately paginated and tagged and it contained relevant documents. More impressive was the fact that she was able to read and understand the cases in the Applicant’s Bundle of Authorities and submit that their cases were not relevant as the critical facts in those cases were different from the facts of her case - “I wish to say that the cases that the learned lawyers from Rajah & Tann brought up are all not insurance cases.” What was quite remarkable was the fact that she managed to discern the main facts by simply “flicking through” the cases and then submit with conviction that Applicant’s lawyers “were not really comparing apple to apple. They are sort of comparing an apple to may be a durian. It’s not really relevant to my case.”[^20] and why their cases were not relevant:

> “So, the cases that the learned lawyers from Rajah & Tann brought up were not between insurance policyholders and the insurance companies. They were more of like from finance or other big companies. So, I’m just a very small person, so I cannot be compared on the same scale as the cases that they have brought up.”[^21]

45     Essentially, I found that the Respondent committed the breaches knowingly and she had decided to be non-compliant “Because my mindset was that I just did not want to take down---"[^22]

#### Reasons 3: The Respondent did not make any genuine or substantive attempts to comply with the judgment or order

46     It was not in dispute that the Respondent did not make any attempt to comply with the Interim Order. In fact, she had blatantly reposted the offensive posts and encouraged people to share them after the said order was issued. She also did not comply with the Final Order when it was issued that required her to take down the offensive posts within 24 hours and to publish and issue the correction notice by 3 March 2021. The evidence also suggested that she had taken down the offensive posts in March 2021 not in a genuine attempt to respect and comply with the court order. She did it as she had believed that this would aid her plan to vary the Final Order so that she could continue to “do whatever that I can but whatever that I am not able to do, I will not do it.”.

47     Further, her reasons for not publishing and issuing the correction notice were unreasonable and inexcusable. She claimed that she could not comply “Because if I were to do the corrective actions it will mean that I lied in Court, then the Court can charge me what.”[^23] Her disrespect for the judicial process was clearly demonstrated when she insisted that she had done enough to purge her contempt and should not be required to publish and issue the correction notice, “I have already complied in the sense that I had removed the Facebook things but for this correction notices, I would never do it… So, I hope Your Honour will understand my predicament, okay? I---and---I don’t---I do not want to be in contempt of the Court, okay? I had already re---removed the Facebook and the TikTok but with---for this correction notice, I really am not able to do it. So, I hope---I hope---I just hope Your Honour can pity me and understand my position. I hope Your Honour will be lenient.”[^24]

#### Reason 4: Impact of the Respondent’s contemptuous conduct

48     I accepted the Applicant’s counsel’s submission that the Respondent was motivated to “make the applicant look as bad as possible” when they refused to accede to her demand for compensation.[^25] Even if the Applicant did not suffer any quantifiable harm, the evidence showed that the Respondent had taken active steps to cause harm. To increase her outreach, she repeatedly asked her followers to share the offensive posts and to keep her outreach up, she reposted her posts repeatedly. I accept that with only 57 persons sharing the posts, the potential of the posts going viral was rather dim, but the fact remained that as long as the posts remain uncorrected online, the published posts may potentially damage the Applicant’s reputation. The Applicant’s lawyers had submitted, “So, again I ---I---I don’t have figures for actual loss because obviously it would be impossible to determine how many people perhaps didn’t approach my client because they saw this information. But the fact is this---these falsehood in these postings were made with the intention of doing that and that I would submit it is the more important thing to consider rather than the actual loss.”[^26] I accepted this submission as the Respondent had 88,154 followers at the material time and she had published her posts specifically to embarrass and damage the Applicant’s reputation.

49     In addition, her deliberate contemptuous conduct also affected the authority of the courts. Her contempt in relation to the Interim Order is now incapable of being purged or remedied. As for the Final Order, she is still in breach because for some reason she continues to believe that she can choose to not comply to avoid being called a liar. Because of the persistent defiance on her part, a firm sentence had to be considered to protect and preserve the authority of the Courts \[See **_PT Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and Ors_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 20</span> at \[85\] (“**_PT Sandipala_**”).

#### Reason 5: Public policy considerations

50     In this case, the false statements were shared through the issuance of letters and emails to various persons and agencies and publication on the two social media platforms. The evidence showed that the Respondent had attempted to instigate the authorities in Singapore and in Japan to conduct investigations against the Applicant to pressurise them to accede to her demand for compensation. Her main motivation in taking her cause online was for the same reason; i.e.; to publicly embarrass the Applicant into giving in to her demands by actively taking steps to achieve wide dissemination. Since information can easily and very quickly be disseminated online and can remain permanently displayed for the general online community to view, there are compelling policy reasons to deter the publication of false statements online to embarrass and harass. Therefore, the Applicant’s contemptuous decision to broadcast and re-broadcast the false statements required the imposition of a custodial sentence not just to coerce her to issue the correction notice but also to achieve the punitive effect to deter her and other like-minded persons from engaging in contemptuous conduct online.

51     For the aforesaid reasons, it was clear in my mind that her deliberate and persistent refusal to comply with the court orders during and after court proceedings to pursue her agenda against the Applicant justified the imposition of a custodial sentence. This was necessary especially when her contempt is yet to be fully purged and she had unequivocally stated on 30 July 2021 that she did not wish to and could not publish and issue the correction notice.[^27] As highlighted by the High Court in **_Tan Beow Hiong v Tan Boon Aik_** <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 870</span> at \[63 – \[64\] and **_Sembcorp Marine Ltd v Aurol Anthony Sabastian_** <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 245</span> (“**_Sembcorp Marine_**”) at \[57\], the continuing and deliberate contemptuous conduct and where the contempt has yet to be purged in wilful defiance of a court order would warrant a custodial sentence. In other words, I decided that a fine, even a high fine, would not be adequate to punish the egregious nature of the contempt and to deter the Respondent from continuing with her contemptuous behaviour or to achieve general deterrence.

### Why 4 weeks’ imprisonment was the appropriate sentence to impose?

52     Having determined that the Respondent’s contemptuous conduct warranted the imposition of a custodial sentence, I decided that it would be appropriate to sentence her to 4 weeks’ imprisonment. I will now explain why this sentence is not just fair but appropriate to achieve the punitive and coercive effect that is required on the facts of this case.

53      _Applicant’s sentencing position:_ Relying on their sentencing precedents, the Applicant’s counsel had initially urged the court to impose a custodial sentence of between 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment and had also objected to the sentence being suspended “given that the Respondent has been told time and time again to comply and has refused.”

54     After hearing the Respondent declare during Committal Proceedings that she could not be compelled to publish and issue the correction notice and that she would rather die than comply with the Final Order, the Applicant’s lawyers reviewed their sentencing position and urged the court to sentence her to 6 month’s imprisonment:

> “As such, we would in light of what she has said at the last hearing, now recommend a term of **6 months with a suspended period of 2 weeks** to procure compliance. We respectfully submit that if this Court is to take into account the coercive effect of sentencing, anything shorter is likely to not have any effect on the Respondent.”[^28]

55     They further argued that the facts in the sentencing precedents referred to by the Respondent’s counsel in support of a short custodial sentence were distinguishable from the facts of this case and that the following six sentencing precedents were more analogous and relevant:

> (i)      **_Cartier International BV v Lee Hock Lee and another application_** <span class="citation">\[1992\] 3 SLR(R) 340</span> (“**_Cartier International_**”) (6 months’ imprisonment imposed);

> (ii)      **_Mok Kah Hong_** (8 months’ imprisonment with a suspension of sentence for 4 weeks);

> (iii)      **_OCM Opportunities_** (6 months’ imprisonment imposed);

> (iv)      **_Maruti Shipping Pte Ltd v Tay Sien Djim and Ors_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 227</span> (“**_Maruti Shipping_**”) (6 months’ imprisonment imposed);

> (v)      **_Toyota Tsusho (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd v Foo Tseh Wan and Ors <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1215</span>_** (**_“Toyota Tsusho”_**) (3 months’ imprisonment with a suspension of sentence for 10 days); and

> (vi)      **_Technigroup Far East Pte Ltd and Anor v Jaswinderpal Singh s/o Bachint Singh and Ors <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1391</span> (“Technigroup Far East”)_** (4 months’ imprisonment with a suspension of sentence for 4 weeks).

56      _Respondent’s sentencing position_: The Respondent’s counsel on the other hand submitted that if the Court was minded to impose a custodial sentence, it should be shorter than the sentence imposed in **_Tay Yun Chwan Henry v Chan Siew Lee Jannie_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 181</span> (“**_Tay Yun Chwan Henry_**”) which was 2 weeks’ imprisonment. Her counsel argued that the facts of this case are “akin to the facts in the case of Tay Yun Chwan Henry” but with fewer aggravating factors.[^29] He referred to the sentences imposed in **_Sembcorp Marine, PT Sandipala_** and **_Global Distressed Alpha Fund I Ltd Partnership v PT Bakrie Investindo_** <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 105</span> (“**_Global Distressed Alpha Fund I_**_”_) to propose that it would be appropriate to impose a sentence between 5 days to 7 days’ imprisonment.

57     To determine the appropriate period of incarceration, I considered the following sentencing factors:

> (a)     nature of the contemptuous conduct – one-off or continuing or repeated;

> (b)     aggravating factors;

> (c)     mitigating factors and evidence of genuine remorse; including any attempt to purge the contempt; and

> (d)     harm or loss caused.

58      _Nature of the contemptuous conduct_: As stated above, the Respondent had wilfully refused to comply with the two court orders over a period of eight months and this involved repeated breaches. She disobeyed the Interim Order until the conclusion of the substantive hearing on 10 February 2021 and she had republished the offensive posts on several occasions during this period. Thereafter, she proceeded to disobey the Final Order in toto until March 2021 when she retracted the offensive posts from her Facebook and Tik Tok accounts. As hers was a continuing breach and she is still refusing to publish and issue the correction notice, I had to impose a sentence that is sufficiently coercive to effect compliance. See **_Mok Kah Hong_** at \[103\]:

> “103  We are of the view that a distinction should also be drawn between breaches which are one-off in nature and breaches which are either continuing or repeated in nature. Even among cases involving contempt by disobedience, the sentencing principles applicable to a one-off breach and a continuing breach are likely to be different. In this regard, we find the following observations by Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in _Lightfoot v Lightfoot_ \[1989\] 1 FLR 414 (at 416–417) to be instructive:

>> …Sentences for contempt really fall into two different categories. There is the purely punitive sentence where the contemnor is being punished for a breach of an order which has occurred but which was a once and for all breach. A common example, of course, is a non-molestation order where the respondent does molest the petitioner and that is an offence for which he has to be punished. In fixing the sentence there can well be an element of deterrence to deter him from doing it again and to deter others from doing it. That is one category.

>> There is a second category which I might describe as a coercive sentence where the contemnor has been ordered to do something and is refusing to do it. Of course, a sentence in that case also has a punitive element since he has to be punished for having failed to do so up to the moment of the court hearing. But nevertheless it also has a coercive element.

>> Now, it is at that point that it is necessary to realise that in earlier times the court would in such circumstances have imposed an indefinite sentence. That is to say a man would be committed to prison until such time as he purged his contempt by complying with the order. …

> It is acknowledged that the above observations were made in the context of cases involving contempt by disobedience. Nevertheless, we are of the view that the same considerations will apply in the case of a “once and for all breach” as regards contempt by interference. For instance, publishing material which scandalises the judiciary or acting in a manner which amounts to contempt in the face of the court will likely fall within the category of one-off breaches. In this category of cases, the overriding sentencing principle is one of punishment, in that the breach has already been committed. There is no coercive value in the sentence to be imposed as the contemnor is usually not in a position to remedy the breach, apart from the expression of contrition by way of retraction of the scandalising material or a public apology. This stands in contrast to a situation where a contemnor is ordered to do an act but continuously refuses to comply, as in the present case. In these circumstances, the objective of compelling the contemnor to effect compliance with the order is likely to be a given a significant degree of weight. That is not to say that there is no punitive element in the sentences imposed on such contemnors. In fact, in most instances of a “continuing” breach, the sentence imposed will include both _punitive_ and _coercive_ elements. However, the same cannot be said as regards one-off breaches, where the coercive element is _not_ likely to feature at all. In our view, it is important to keep this distinction in mind when examining case precedents on contempt, regardless of whether they involve contempt by interference or contempt by disobedience.”

59     There was also no doubt that the contents of her offensive posts and the video that were uploaded online were intended to cause deliberate and calculated harm to the Applicant. Her Tik Tok video showed her protesting in front of the Applicant’s office with a board containing the false statements and she had used her Facebook account to broadcast the offensive posts in an equally dramatic manner:

![]([2021] SGDC 0258_Image/[2021] SGDC 0258_image1.png)

60     While the Respondent may have done this to warn others, this was probably secondary to her to main motivation to embarrass the Applicant and to compel them to give in to her demands by generating a viral outrage. Simply put, any sentence imposed in this case had to be sufficiently long to have both a punitive and coercive effect considering the length of disobedience and the motivation underpinning the contempt.

61      _Aggravating factors_: There were several aggravating factors in this case and a few of them were egregious. First, she failed to take down the posts even after being given numerous opportunities to take remedial action and her reasons for her non-compliance were wholly unacceptable. For e.g.; she did not comply with the Interim Order as she decided that it was less binding than a final order and that it would be inconvenient to comply. This suggested that the Respondent believed that she had the option to disregard a court order if it did not suit her.

62     Second, the Respondent had committed a litany of breaches over the 8-month period, and she is still in breach. Further, unlike the contemnors in **_PT Sandipala Arthaputra_** and **_Global Distressed Alpha Fund I_** who had disobeyed EJD Orders, the Respondent’s contempt was not tacit in nature. She had on several occasions uploaded the offensive posts in active defiance of the directions issued by the court. She re-posted the false statements several times in breach of the Interim Order after being directed during the pre-trial conferences to take them down. The most egregious breach took place when she reposted the offensive posts three times on 10 February 2021 after the terms of the Final Order were explained to her by the court. This was a blatant and defiant breach as it was probably committed to provoke and generate online interest in her posts before the end of the 24-hour period. This inference is supported by the fact that she did not republish her offensive posts after 10 February 2021.

63      _Mitigating facts and evidence of genuine remorse; including any attempt to purge the contempt:_ Apart from the fact that the Respondent had taken down the offensive posts on her Facebook and Tik Tok accounts before the Committal Proceedings, there were no other mitigating factors in her favour. While she did take steps to purge her contempt, I could not ignore the fact that she is still uncooperative and refusing to notify her followers that she had posted false statements against the Applicant. Further, I was also not able to discern any demonstration of genuine remorse or regret on the part of the Respondent during the Committal Proceedings.

64      _Impact of the contemptuous conduct – harm or loss caused_: Although as alluded to above, the harm caused to the Applicant was not quantifiable, I agreed with the Applicant’s counsel that the potential damage to the Applicant’s reputation was real. This is because the Respondent’s falsehoods were broadcasted online, and she had encouraged others to disseminate the falsehoods. Apart from the possibility of a wide online sharing with 88,154 followers, there was a real possibility that these falsehoods may be shared for a long time due to the permanence nature of online publications; thereby having the potential of causing long-lasting harm; especially when the Respondent is refusing to publish and issue the correction notice. As noted in **_Sembcorp Marine_**, “the loss of reputation or embarrassment for an established and listed company like SCM may be significant and cannot always be compensated by costs.”[^30]

65     More importantly, by disobeying the court orders, the Respondent perverted the course of justice and she continues to challenge the Court’s authority and undermine the administration of justice for inexcusable reasons by refusing to publish and issue the correction notice. In fact, her contemptuous conduct went beyond non-compliance. She had contumaciously on several occasions encouraged others to disseminate the offensive posts. This wilful interference with the course of justice clearly warranted a firm sentence to achieve the punitive effect.

66     I also compared the facts of this case with the precedents referred to by the two parties. The Applicant’s counsel relied on a set of precedents where the sentences imposed ranged from 3 to 6 months’ imprisonment whereas the Respondent’s counsel referred to cases where the custodial sentences ranged from 5 days to 2 weeks’ imprisonment. Although lengthy sentences of 4 to 8 months’ imprisonment were imposed in some cases, it is trite that any sentence imposed must “turn on its own facts” and the nature of contempt: **_PT Sandipala_** at \[68\] - “On the question of what the appropriate sanction is, it is clear the sanction must depend on the facts of each case and the nature of the contempt.” Having analysed the cases referred to by the Applicant’s counsel in their submissions, I decided that they were not the most relevant as the nature of contempt in those cases was quite different and further, the gravity of the contemptuous conduct was significantly higher, involving fraudulent or dishonest conduct.

67     In relation to **_Cartier International_**, the nature of the contemptuous conduct and the context in which it was committed were quite different from that in this case. The contemnor had breached an interlocutory order restraining him from infringing a trademark by continuing to sell counterfeit watches. It can be inferred from the decision that a fairly lengthy imprisonment was imposed as (i) the contemnor disobeyed the court order to continue running his unlawful business (i.e.; for financial gain) and (ii) he had made extensive arrangements to avoid detection of his contempt – “He also had been contumelious and clever in the way he went to circumvent orders of the court.”[^31] In order words, the 6-month deterrent sentence was probably imposed “to persuade offenders that law-breaking is not the way to make a living.”

68     As for the other cases, the sentences ranged from 3 months to 8 months’ imprisonment and in my judgment, the gravity of the contemptuous conduct in those cases was much higher. **_Mok Kah Hong_**’s case concerned the division of matrimonial property and the Court of Appeal had decided to impose a stiff sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment as the contemnor had belligerently impeded “a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets” by divesting his assets. He also had a long history of disobeying court orders and disregarding judgements, causing his wife to be evicted from her home on one occasion. His persistent and deliberate disobedience caused the Court of Appeal to observe that “Almost all the egregious factors which were employed by the courts to impose a stiff sentence on the contemnors in the above cases can be found on the facts if this case.”[^32] and that “the non-compliance on the part of the husband was both _deliberate_ and _fraudulent_.”[^33]. This serious aggravating factor of engaging in fraudulent conduct is absent in this case.

69     For the three cases, **_OCM Opportunities_** (6 months)[^34], **_Maruti Shipping_** (6 months), **_Technigroup Far East_** (4 months)**_[^35]_**, where sentences between 4 to 6 months’ were imposed, it can be inferred that the firm sentences were imposed in those cases as the contemnors had disobeyed mainly to impede the judicial process[^36] and then tried all means to avoid being convicted for contempt[^37]. In these cases, the contemnors had also deliberately dissipated assets/monies in breach of court orders. In **_Maruti Shipping_**, the contemnor dragged the proceedings for more than three years and was a “repeat offender”. He had breached a Mareva injunction in another case for which he was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment. Even in **_Toyota Tsusho_** where the contemnor was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment, the gravity of the contemptuous conduct was higher than that in this case. First, the contemnor **_Toyota Tsusho_** had refused to comply to impede the tracing and recovery of monies and second, the contemnor was found to have been untruthful in his affidavits. Accordingly, it was clear to me that any sentence passed in this case had be less than 3 months’ imprisonment.

70     In my judgment, the nature of the contemptuous conduct of the contemnors in **_Sempcorp Marine Ltd_** and **_Tay Yun Chwan Henry v Chan Siew Lee Jamie <span class="citation">\[2018\]SGHC 181</span>_** (“**_Tay Yun Chwan Henry_**”**_)_** was most similar to that of Respondent’s but less egregious. In **_Sembcorp Marine_**, the contemnor had breached the interim sealing order by forwarding two sealed documents to a journalist and the court had found that he had done this out of spite to embarrass the plaintiff – “Mr Aurol was not motivated by pecuniary advantage or even by exercising his freedom of expression. His primary motivation was spite and to cause maximum embarrassment to SCM, a public listed company.”[^38] While the contemnor’s breach was irreversible, it was one-off, and this was the main distinguishing factor. In this case, the Respondent had deliberately breached the court orders on multiple occasions and her disobedience is continuing. Therefore, the sentence in this case had to be higher than 5 days to reflect the gravity of the Respondent’s wrongdoing.

71     In **_Tay Yun Chwan Henry_**, the contemnor was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment after three sets of committal proceedings for her “unwilful, unrestrained and irresponsible behaviour of sending emails to large number of recipients” in breach of the court order. While the sustained offending behaviour on the part of the contemnor in that case was comparatively more serious, I bore in mind that when determining the sentence, the court had taken into account the contemnor’s worsened psychiatric condition and the causal link that may have reduced her culpability – “I accepted that the defendant was labouring under severe stress at the time of the breaches, no doubt exacerbated in part by her psychiatric condition, as well as her having to deal with the other legal proceedings commenced against her and having to care for her daughter.”[^39] Since this significant mitigating factor is absent in this case and the Respondent’s disobedience was mainly dictated by her wilfulness, I decided that her overall gravity warranted an uplift of the sentence to 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

72     For the reasons stated above, I was fortified in my conclusion that it was fair and appropriate to sentence the Respondent to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for her contempt of court. A sufficiently long sentence had to be imposed to coerce her to purge her contempt and to give a clear signal that she cannot at her own option, disregard and disobey court orders.

73     On 30 July 2021 when parties appeared before me to consider the issue of suspension of sentence to allow the Respondent one last opportunity to purge her contempt, the Respondent unequivocally stated that she could not be compelled to issue the correction notice and that she would rather die than comply with the Final Order. Considering her response, I decided not to suspend the sentence imposed.
