### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       The accused, _Mr Leong Kim Onn John_, a 55-year old male Singaporean, had pleaded guilty on 28 June 2019 to _seven charges_ out of _twenty-two charges_ of cheating under s 417 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **DAC 905694-2018, DAC 905695-2018, DAC 911889-2018, DAC 919829-2018, DAC 919830-2018, DAC 919832-2018** and **DAC 942810-2018**. Essentially, the accused had cheated his victims through the use of the online platform “Carousell” by inducing them to deliver monies to him as payments of deposit for room rentals and payments for hotel stays when he knew he was neither in a position to rent the rooms nor did he have the hotel rooms available.

2       The remaining _fifteen_ similar charges under s 417 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. In view of his lengthy antecedents for property-related offences which is indicative of a habitual offender and the specific requirements for the calling of such reports under s 304 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.) were met, I had called for suitability reports for both corrective training and preventive detention. His matter was adjourned for sentencing on 25 July 2019 to enable the preparation of these suitability reports.

3       On 25 July 2019, a reading of the suitability reports for both corrective training and preventive detention indicated he had been found to be physically and mentally fit and suitable to undergo corrective training as well as preventive detention. As I was satisfied that it was expedient for the protection of the public that he should be in custody for a substantial period of time, I sentenced him to the minimum prescribed period of seven years’ of preventive detention.

4       The accused is dissatisfied with my decision and he has filed an appeal against his sentence through his Counsel on 25 July 2019 itself. His Counsel applied for bail pending appeal and his bail was increased to $40,000 with one surety. To date, the accused had not furnished bail and is presently serving his sentence in Cluster A pending the hearing of his appeal. His late date of release (“LDR”) is on 24 July 2026.

## B.   Statement of Facts

5       The Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) prepared by the Prosecution which the accused had admitted to without qualification is as follows:

## D.   Prosecution’s Address On Sentence

7       In its oral address on sentence, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s antecedents speak for themselves. The accused had a lengthy antecedent for property-related offences. It was further submitted that the present set of charges came just five years after the accused had served a lengthy ten years of corrective training. In the present case, the accused had gone on to commit scams on Carousell.

8       The Prosecution urged the Court to call for corrective training and preventive detention suitability reports. It was submitted that both the principles of specific deterrence, prevention as well as the protection of the public feature in this case.

## E.   Mitigation

#### Background

9       In his written plea in mitigation, his Counsel submitted that the accused is 55 years of age and is divorced. He has had a difficult past with his family. He left home when he was in his 20s dues to difficulties living with his family and was estranged from his family. According to the accused, his parents refused to turn up at his wedding reception.

10     According to his Counsel that given the troubles at home, the accused found himself keeping with the wrong kind of company and as a result had several brushes with the law. It was submitted that he was disheartened when his family did not visit him during his incarceration. He further lost an avenue of support when his then-wife left him. According to his Counsel, the accused and his family have since reconciled and they are supportive of the accused in the face of the present criminal proceedings.

#### Circumstances of the present offences

11     It was submitted that the accused had made the misguided decision out of a sense of desperation to help his current romantic partner, Ms One Huynh Thi Bich Quyen. According to his Counsel, the accused found out that her mother had been diagnosed with cervical cancer. It was the case for the Defence that the accused had intended to help raise funds for the stricken woman but regrettably took an inapproproiate means to do so.

12     It was further submitted that the accused acknowledged his wrongdoing and was remorseful for his actions. It was highlighted that he had made full restitution to the victims. He had also provided letters of apology to the individual victims. It was suggested by his Counsel that his actions went beyond just making restitution and was an unequivocal demonstration of genuine remorse.

#### Sentencing considerations

13     It was submitted that the High Court in _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> held that a custodial sentence would generally be appropriate as long as the s 417 Penal Code offence in question causes victim to part with property that has more than a negligible value at \[47\]. Sentencing considerations include, _inter alia_, the value of the property and the level of deception involved at \[48\]. In that case, the appellate court had considered the full restitution made and the offence being the accused’s first cheating offence.

14     In the present case while it was conceded that the accused was not untraced, it was submitted that his antecedents were dated, the last one arising in 2002. It was further submitted that the relevant sums for the individual charges were low and full restitution was effected. Furthermore, the accused had pleaded guilty at the pre-trial stage and was genuinely remorseful.

#### Sentencing considerations – preventive detention

15     It was submitted that preventive detention was intended for habitual offenders considered too recalcitrant for reforming. It should be imposed where an offender is shown to be such a menace to society that justifies incarceration for a substantial period of time: _Public Prosecutor v Rosli bin Yassin_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 831</span>(“_Rosli bin Yassin_”). It was highlighted in that case, in addition to the accused’s history of reoffending, the Court of Appeal at \[29\] had considered the fact that the respondent did not have a supportive network. He was not in contact with both his ex-wife and children and did not have a fixed place of abode. It was further submitted that its significance stems from the fact that this sheds light on the possibility of reform and the need for courts to look at the “totality of the offender’s previous convictions.” at \[11\].

16     It was the case for the Defence that the present case bears several key distinguishing points namely, the existence of a supportive network and the absence of prior lengthy terms of imprisonment. The accused has the benefit of a supportive network as his family has since rallied behind him since their reconnection after years of estrangement. The accused also has his partner, Ms Huynh Thi Bich Quyen standing by him this time. It was submitted that the presence of the True Jesus Church was an additional pillar of support and medium for the accused’s reformation. It was further submitted the accused quite unlike his previous years of estranged familial relations is able to benefit from the community around him actively involved in the mending of his ways.

17     It was highlighted that a review of the accused’s antecedents would reflect the lack of lengthy custodial sentences like that in _Public Prosecutor v Tan Yong Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 289</span> (“_Tan Yong Seng_”). It was submitted that the accused’s previous imprisonment terms ranged from several months to a single year before culminating in corrective training in 2002. It was submitted that the extent of recidivism is lower in the present case as the deterrent effect of his shorter custodial sentences would have similarly been lower. It was further submitted that the accused in _Tan Yong Seng_ could more easily be said to be comparatively recidivist by virtue of the higher number of lengthier sentences served.

18     It was highlighted that the accused in the present case spent several years without incident since his release from corrective training. Due weight should be accorded to the substantial “break” in offending behaviour. In the light of the foregoing, it was suggested that the totality of the circumstances suggested that the accused had not necessarily crossed the threshold to be characterised as a menace to society requiring preventive detention for the expedience of public safety. His Counsel urged the Court to consider a short custodial sentence as an appropriate sentence to serve the need for both deterrence and proportionality.

19     It was orally submitted that the nature of the offences was cheating simpliciter and the amounts were small. It was highlighted that the set of offences in 2002 were far more serious although it was conceded that there was a spree of offences. His Counsel orally urged the Court to impose a stiff sentence on the accused.

## Pre-sentence reports

20     In view of the accused’s lengthy antecedents for property related offences including a prior ten-year term of corrective training and the fact that the technical requirements under s 304 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.) were met, I had called for suitability reports for both corrective training and preventive detention. His matter was adjourned for sentencing to 25 July 2019 to enable the preparation of these suitability reports. He was remanded on 28 June 2019 to facilitate the preparation of these reports.

21     On 25 July 2019, the accused was informed that the suitability reports for both corrective training and preventive detention indicated that he had been found to be physically and mentally fit and suitable to undergo corrective training as well as preventive detention. The reports also indicated that his LS/CMI score placed him in the Moderate Risk/Need level of criminal re-offeding. He was assessed to belong to a group of prisoners with a 30% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release.

## F.   Prosecution’s Further Submissions on sentence

22     Having noted that the accused had been assessed to be suitable for both preventive detention or corrective training, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of either corrective training or preventive detention. It was submitted that if the Court was minded to impose corrective training, the Prosecution sought a sentence which was guided by his most recent sentence imposed in 2002 which is for a period of at least ten years. In the alternative, if the Court was minded to impose preventive detention, the Prosecution further submitted that the statutory prescribed minimum period of seven years was appropriate.

23     It was the case for the Prosecution that there were two main reasons why such sentences were sought. Firstly, it was submitted in respect of the accused’s propensity to criminal behaviour as well as what was cited in the report, his attitudes and orientation from page 6 (of Part VI – General Risk Factors under the header Attitudes/Orientation) of the suitability reports shows that the accused held attitudes supportive of crime. He had justified his current offences as a quick way to meet his financial needs and he was the one who suggested cheating. It was further submitted that he had also tried to rationalize the offence away and minimize his role in the offences.

24     Secondly, it was submitted that as regards to the general risk of criminal recidivism at page 7 (of Part VII – under the header General Risk of Criminal Recidivism) of the reports, his score placed him in the Moderate Risk/Need level of criminal reoffending. He belonged to a group of prisoners with a 30% probability of recidivism within two years of release. It was further submitted that in relation to his habitual offending just based on the length of his antecedents and also the fact that in his previous records in 2002, there were at least ten cheating charges under s 420 Penal Code taken into consideration where the exact modus operandi was used. He had advertised that he had rental units and he received returns. In the present case, the accused had advertised hotel stays and received monies in his account.

25     In view of his reoffending after his ten years of corrective training, it was the case for the Prosecution that this indicated a lack of responsiveness on his part to the previous lengthy punishment. In that regard, it was submitted that the principle of specific deterrence would feature. Further, the principle of protecting the public would feature because of the similar modus operandi and also prevention of these similar offences.

26     The Prosecution sought a term of at least ten years of corrective training primarily because the accused had committed similar offences in the past from which he had not learned. The Court was urged to look at the ten years corrective training term which was last imposed as a minimum starting point.

27     It was further submitted that as for the sentencing option of preventive detention, it was noted that there would be no remission should the sentence be imposed. Nonetheless, it was also noted that the accused has not been sentenced to preventive detention before. The accused had a moderate risk of recidivism and taking that into account, the Prosecution was of the view that the statutory prescribed minimum period of seven years would be appropriate in the current circumstances.

## G.   Defence’s Further Submissions on sentence

28     His Counsel had applied to cross-examine the correctional rehabilitation specialist who had prepared the suitability reports as the accused disagreed with the assessment that he had tried to minimize his role in his offences. Counsel had submitted that this aspect of the specialist’s assessment might have gone towards the assessment made about the risk probability in this case.

29     I was mindful that the preparation of this report was based on an interview conducted with the accused on 2 July 2019 as well as information derived from the charge sheets for the present case, the Statement of Facts, the accused’s antecedents, the memo by the prison psychiatrist (indicating that he was of normal mental condition with no current indication of any major mental illness) and the Prisons Operations and Rehabilitation System. The purpose of this report was to determine his suitability for either corrective training and preventive detention. It was for the Court to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused. As it was an instance where the accused disagreed with the assessment that he had tried to minimize his role in his offences and there were no other cogent reasons provided or any objective basis to refute the assessment, I disallowed the application. I did not think that it was necessary to adjourn the matter further so that arrangements could be made to secure the attendance of the correctional rehabilitation specialist.

30     Counsel maintained that the accused had not minimized his role in his offences. He submitted that the accused had pleaded guilty and had fully admitted to the facts and circumstances of the case. It was further submitted that the accused had made full restitution with apology to the respective victims.

## H.   The Sentence

#### Prescribed punishments for cheating

31     The prescribed punishment for an offence of cheating under s 417 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) is a term of imprisonment which may extend to 3 years or with fine or with both.

32     In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of corrective training for at least ten years or in the alternative, preventive detention for the minimum prescribe period of seven years. This is in view of his lengthy antecedents for property-related offences and the fact that he committed the present offences just five years after serving a lengthy ten years’ of corrective training. This indicated a lack of responsiveness on his part to the previous lengthy punishment and in that regard, the principle of specific deterrence would feature.

33     In addition, it was the Prosecution’s position that the principle of protecting the public would feature because of the similar modus operandi used and also the prevention of these similar offences. It was highlighted that the accused held attitudes supportive of crime, he had justified his current offences as a quick way to meet his financial needs and he had minimised his role in the offences.

34     In contrast, his Counsel urged the Court to consider a short custodial sentence or a stiff sentence to serve the need for both deterrence and proportionality. His Counsel sought to distinguish his case from the cases of _Rosli bin Yassin_ and _Tan Yong Seng_ on the basis of the existence of a support network for the accused and the absence of prior lengthy terms of imprisonment in the present case. The accused also did not accept the correctional rehabilitation specialist’s assessment that he had tried to minimize his role in his offences. According to his Counsel, the accused had made the misguided decision out of a sense of desperation to help his current romantic partner.

#### Sentencing considerations

35     Based on the accused’s lengthy antecedents for property-related offences and the fact that he committed the present offences just five years after serving a lengthy ten years’ of corrective training, I did not agree with Counsel that a short imprisonment term was appropriate for the present case. Furthermore, in the present case this was not an instance where the accused was convicted of a single cheating charge but one where he was convicted on seven out of 22 cheating charges. His Counsel conceded that there was a spree of offences committed by the accused in the present case. It was clear that his previous imprisonment terms in 1987, 1990 and 1995 for property-related offences did little to deter him from reoffending or using the same modus operandi despite serving a lengthy ten-year term of corrective training in 2002.

36     I noted that Counsel had sought to downplay or gloss over the length of the accused’s previous imprisonment terms by stating that they _ranged from several months to a single year_ before culminating in corrective training in 2002. I further noted that in 1987, his global sentence was **10 months’** imprisonment, in 1990 his global sentence was **15 months’** imprisonment and in 1995, his global sentence was **two years’** imprisonment. These terms of imprisonment were by no means short custodial sentences and there was an escalation in the length of the imprisonment terms prior to his ten years’ of corrective training. Hence, I did not accept Counsel’s assertion that the extent of recidivism is lower in the present case (compared to the accused in _Tan Yong Seng_’s case) as the deterrent effect of the accused’s shorter custodial sentences would have similarly been lower.

37     In respect of the accused’s support network, I noted from the pre-sentence reports, the accused himself had indicated that he had limited contact with his adoptive family and had lost contact with his wife and two daughters since his last corrective training sentence. While it is undisputed that the accused had since reconciled with his adoptive family since the time of his remand for the present case, it could not be said that he had an established support network. It was also significant that his pre-sentence reports indicated that the accused generally spent at least three years in the community in between his last three incarcerations until his current offences from 1990 to 2017.

38     As I was of the view that a short imprisonment term was not appropriate in the present case, I then went on to consider whether a sentence of either corrective training or preventive detention was appropriate. I noted that as regards the accused’s general risk of criminal recidivism, his score placed him in the Moderate Risk/Need level of criminal re-offending. He belonged to a group of prisoners with a 30% probability of recidivism within two years of release.

39     In addition, he had committed the present offences just five years after serving ten years of corrective training. Accordingly, I disagreed with Counsel’s submissions that the accused’s antecedents were dated and the last one arising in 2002. I agreed with the Prosecution that this reoffending indicated a lack of responsiveness on his part to the previous lengthy punishment as well as to the training of a corrective character and in that regard, the principle of specific deterrence would feature. Furthermore, the accused was assessed to have held attitudes supportive of crime, he had justified his current offences as a quick way to meet his financial needs and he had minimised his role in the offences. Hence, I was not convinced that another stint of training of a corrective character for a substantial period of time i.e. more than his previous period of ten years would be beneficial to his reformation.

40     The general principles when a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed was set out by the Court of Appeal in _PP v Rosli bin Yassin_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 831</span> at \[10\]_._ In essence, a sentence of preventive detention is intended for habitual offenders aged more than 30 years that the court considers too recalcitrant for reformation.

41     The accused is presently 55 years of age. According to his pre-sentence reports, he presented with an early onset of offending when he was sentenced to probation in 1979 for theft-in-dwelling at 15-years old and in the past 40 years his subsequent six antecedents comprised mainly of theft and cheating-related offences. I agreed with the Prosecution that the principle of protecting the public would feature in the present case because of the similar modus operandi used when he committed the Carousell scams and also the prevention of these similar offences.

42     After having considered the pre-sentence reports as well as the written submissions for both the prosecution and the defence, I was of the view that his previous sentence of ten years’ corrective training in 2002 had no apparent effect on him. The accused was clearly a habitual offender too recalcitrant for reformation and his antecedents clearly reflect this. The accused is a menace to society and he should be incarcerated for a substantial period of time for the expedience of public safety. Hence, I was satisfied that it was expedient for the protection of the public that a sentence of preventive detention which carries a minimum period of 7 years and a maximum period of 20 years be imposed on the accused.

43     Nevertheless, in my consideration of the length of preventive detention to be imposed, I was mindful that the accused had pleaded guilty and he had made full restitution with apology to the victims. All things considered, I was of the view that the minimum prescribed period of seven years of preventive dentention was just and appropriate for the protection of the public in the present case. Initially I was prepared to backdate the sentence of preventive detention to the date when he was first remanded for the preparation of the pre-sentence reports namely, 28 June 2019. Nevertheless, as the accused had applied for bail pending appeal, I ordered the sentence to take effect from 25 July 2019.

44     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against his sentence through his Counsel on 25 July 2019 itself. I had fixed his bail pending the hearing of appeal at $40,000 with one surety. To date, the accused had not furnished bail and is presently serving his sentence in Cluster A pending the hearing of his appeal. His late date of release (“LDR”) is on 24 July 2026.
