### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, by all accounts, a successful businessman and who, at the material time, was a director and in charge of the operations of Asia Rail Engineering Pte Ltd (the Company) made false statements to the Controller of Work Passes in connection with the employment of five foreign workers by the Company. In the applications for the foreign workers, the Accused had over declared the fixed monthly salaries that the Company would pay the workers. The Company paid the foreign workers between $300 and $600 less than the amount declared. Based on the salary declarations in the applications the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) issued S Passes to the foreign workers.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to five charges for offences under s 22(1)(d) read with s 20(1)(a) and punishable under s 22(1)(ii) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). I sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment. The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

## Charges

3       The details of the five charges are essentially the same, the only differences being with respect to (i) the date of the false statement; (ii) the identity of the foreign worker that was the subject of the false statement; and (iii) his occupation. I have reproduced MAC 901058 of 2019 as an example of the proceeded charges:

> **MAC 901059 of 2019**

> You, Manjit Singh s/o Makhan Singh, are charged that, on 5 July 2016, one Asia Rail Engineering Pte. Ltd. (UEN No. 200822907D, a body corporate of which you were the Director, in connection with an application for a work pass for one Yu Yu Maw (FIN: XXX) to be employed by the company as a payroll executive, did make a statement to the Controller of Work Passes which was false in a material particular, in a “Declaration Form for an Application for an S Pass” submitted to the Work Pass Division, Ministry of Manpower, which offence was committed with your consent; to wit, you, in your capacity as the director of the company, made the decision for an on behalf of the company, to declare that the fixed monthly salary of the said foreign employee would be $2,500, when you knew this was false, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22(1)(d) read with section 22(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A), punishable under section 22(1)(ii) of the same Act.

## Facts

4       The Accused is Manjit Singh s/o Makhan Singh, a 59-year-old Malaysian and a Singapore Permanent Resident.

5       On 23 February 2018, MOM investigated the Company and discovered that the Accused had consented to the Company making false statements in connection with the applications for S-Passes for five foreign workers. The details of the false statements were as follows:

6       The Company, with the consent of the Accused, had informed the five foreign workers, prior to their employment, that their salaries would be the figure under the “Actual salary” column above. To this end, each the Company gave each worker two sets of employment contracts, one bearing the declared salary and the other bearing the actual salary. The Company would credit the declared salary to the respective worker’s bank account and informed the worker that he would have to withdraw the difference between the declared salary and the actual salary and pay it to another employee of the Company within a week of payment of the salary.

7       The Accused had, on behalf of the Company, falsely declared in the “Declaration Form for an Application for an S Pass” (the forms) that the foreign workers would be paid the declared salary knowing that they would in fact be paid the actual salary. The Accused never intended to pay the foreign workers their declared salaries. The Company submitted the forms to the Work Pass Division (WPD) of MOM. A key criterion for granting an S-Pass is that the applicant must meet the minimum salary requirements. WPD issued S-Passes to the foreign workers based on the declarations in the forms. WPD has confirmed that but for the Accused’s false declaration on the forms WPD would not have issued S-Passes to the five foreign workers.

8       The five foreign workers complied with the conditions of their employment and dutifully withdrew and returned to the Company the “overpayment” between their declared and actual salary. Details of the repayments were as follows:

## Charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing

9       The Accused admitted to and consented for another ten charges under s 22(1)(d) read with s 20(1)(a) and punishable under s 22(1)(ii) of the EFMA being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Eight of the TIC charges related to false statements made in connection with applications for work passes for an additional four foreign workers. As such, including the proceeded charges, the Accused made false statements in connection to applications for work passes for a total of nine foreign workers.

## Issues to be determined

10     The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     Whether a Short Detention Order (SDO) was appropriate in the present case; and

> (b)     If an SDO was inappropriate, then whether, on the facts and circumstances of the present case, a fine rather than a custodial sentence was appropriate.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

11     The s 22(1)(d) offence is punishable under s 22(1)(ii) with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both.

### Antecedents

12     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

13     The Prosecution submitted that the relevant sentencing considerations for a s 22(1)(d) offence involving false statements made in connection with the application (or renewal) of a work pass were set out in _Chiew Kok Chai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 169</span>. Abdullah J held at \[62\] that a custodial sentence should be the starting point for offences under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA and he endorsed a two-step sentencing bands approach.

14     With regard to the first-step, the offence-specific factors, the Prosecution submitted that there were five offence specific factor present in this case:

> (a)     Materiality of the falsehood – the false statement was material and had WPD been aware of the true state of affair it would not have granted the S-Passes to the foreign workers.

> (b)     Nature and extent of the deception – the deception was conscious, planned and deliberate, as the Accused had never intended to pay the salaries. The Accused had also taken active steps to conceal the offences and avoid detection by his use of two sets of employment contracts and because the Company paid the foreign workers their actual salaries and then required them to payback the overpayment (the clawback). The deception was maintained for periods between three months and 21 months. Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the offences were difficult to detect.

> (c)     Consequences of the deception – the Prosecution submitted that the offences were committed with the “nefarious purpose of saving labour costs”. They pointed out that these offences compromised the job and wage growth opportunities for Singaporeans and that honest employers who played by the rules would be disadvantaged vis-à-vis the Company.

> (d)     Specific role played by the Accused – the Prosecution submitted that the Accused was the mastermind of the scheme.

> (e)     Gains from the commission of the offence – the Prosecution submitted that the Company garnered relatively substantial savings because of the underpayment of salaries to the foreign workers.

15     The Prosecution submitted that based on the offence-specific factors the case fell within Band 1 of _Chiew Kok Chai._ They submitted that the indicative starting sentences after the first-step should have reference to the period that the deception was maintained for each of foreign workers. As such, they submitted that the indicative starting sentence should be between 10 and 14 weeks’ imprisonment.

16     At the second-step of the analysis, the offender-specific factors, the Prosecution submitted that it was an aggravating factor that a further ten charges were taken into consideration and that eight of these charges related to another four foreign workers. With regard to the mitigating factors, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused should receive credit for pleading guilty, cooperating with MOM, as he was a first-time offender and as he had made restitution to all the foreign workers. The Prosecution suggested a discount between three to four weeks’ imprisonment to the indicative starting sentence. The Prosecution submitted that a global sentence of 20 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate.

17     In oral submissions, the Prosecution submitted that the imposition of a Community Based Sentence (CBS) such as an SDO would be inappropriate. The Prosecution submitted that the Defence had not shown how rehabilitation should trump deterrence as the primary sentencing consideration.

### Mitigation

18     The Defence submitted, based on the mitigating factors, that a fine of $15,000 per charge was appropriate. In the alternative, and if a custodial sentence was warranted, the Defence submitted that an SDO was appropriate.

#### Personal and family background

19     The Defence highlighted that one of the Accused’s three adult children, Pavanjit, suffers from a congenital illness, thoracolumbar myelomeningocele and as a result Pavanjit is a paraplegic and is wheelchair bound. Pavanjit requires daily medical assistance, including daily catherization, and the Accused was his primary caregiver. Pavanjit was heavily dependent on the Accused.

20     The Accused’s mother was 83 years old and lived in Johor Baharu. The Accused was solely responsible for her welfare, including bringing her for medical appointments in Singapore. His mother was a diabetic, suffered from high blood pressure and had difficulty walking due to joint pain and arthritis.

#### The Accused was hardworking

21     The Defence submitted that the Accused was a hardworking person who had successfully gone on to run several companies.

#### The Accused’s charitable nature

22     The Defence highlighted that the Accused was a regular donor to the National Kidney Foundation, the Handicap Welfare Association and to an education fund administered by the Sikh Welfare Council. He had also participated in a charity run arranged by a running group he was a member of, the Hash House Harriers. The run raised $21,000 for the AWWA.

#### Chiew Kok Chai sentencing principles

23     The Defence submitted that Abdullah J had not found that a custodial sentence was mandatory for an offence under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA and that at \[68\] the Judge had found that a fine might be appropriate “where strong personal mitigating factors were present”.

24     With regard to the first-step of the of analysis, i.e. the offence-specific factors, the Defence submitted as follows:

> (a)     Nature, sophistication and extent of the deception – the Defence submitted that the extent of the deception was minimal and the offences were not sophisticated. It was emphasised that the underpayment to each of the foreign workers was “around $450 per month” and that this was a small difference in contrast to other cases where the underpayment ranged from $700 to $2,880[^1].

> (b)     Consequences of the deception – the Defence submitted that the consequences of the deception was not as severe as in precedent cases. The Defence highlighted that there was no harm caused, no threats issued and there was no exploitation of the foreign workers. The Defence contrasted the present case with _Public Prosecutor v Son Mi Jun_ (MAC 907771 to 907792 of 2017), where the foreign workers were only informed that they would receive lower salaries than what was promised after they had arrived in Singapore and were threatened with repatriation if they did not accept the revised salaries.

> (c)     The Defence highlighted that the actual salaries paid to the workers were close to (or the same as) the minimum salary of $2,200 mandated by MOM for S-Pass holders and, as such, that the foreign workers were not poorly paid.

> (d)     Motive of the deception – the Defence submitted that the reason the Accused had underpaid the foreign workers was to prevent tension between these workers and other employees on the Company’s payroll. MOM would only issue S-Passes if the foreign workers’ salaries were at or above the minimum salary stipulated by MOM for that class of work pass. However, if the Company paid the foreign workers the declared salaries then they would be earning more than the starting salaries of other employees who had joined the Company earlier. This would have caused unhappiness amongst these other employees.

> (e)     The Defence submitted that there was no exploitation of the workers and stated that for two of the employees, Ronquillo and Ansari, they were eventually paid a higher salary than the salary declared to MOM.

> (f)     Finally, the Defence pointed out that the case of _Chiew Kok Chai_ was considerably more egregious than the present case.

25     Based on the offence-specific factors, the Defence submitted that the Accused fell within Band 1 of the sentencing bands in _Chiew Kok Chai_. However, after consideration of the offender-specific factors the Accused should be placed at the lower end of Band 1. The offender-specific factors that the Defence relied on are as follows:

> (a)     The Accused had made full restitution of the amounts owed to the foreign workers. The Company had paid the foreign workers over $59,000.

> (b)     The Accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity.

> (c)     The Accused was a first time offender and was, otherwise, of a good character.

> (d)     The Accused was an elderly offender.

26     Based on the offender specific factors the Defence submitted that I should fine the Accused $15,000 for each offence.

#### Short detention order

27     However, if I found that a custodial sentence was appropriate then the Defence submitted that I should order an SDO. The Defence referred to the decision in _Bachoo Mohan Singh v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 1037</span> and submitted that the “clang of prison gates” principle applied to the Accused. They submitted that an SDO and the consequent incarceration would be sufficient to expose the Accused to the “clang of the prison gates” and to deter him and others from committing these offences in the future.

### Precedents

28     The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents. The Prosecution submitted that the present case was similar to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Tan Lee Hwa_ (MAC 908050 to 908061 of 2020).

29     The Defence submitted that the Court should consider four precedent cases[^2], primarily to show that the amount underpaid in the present case was far lower than the amounts underpaid in those cases.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Relevant legislative provisions

30     The relevant legislative provisions of the EFMA are as follows:

> **20.** —(1)    Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved -

>> (_a_)    to have been committed with the consent or connivance of an officer of the body corporate;

> the officer as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.

#### Sentencing considerations for s 22(1)(d) offences involving the work pass framework

32     Amendments to the EFMA, which came into force on 9 November 2012, increased the maximum fine to $20,000 and the maximum imprisonment term to two years for offences under section 22(1)(d). The objective of the enhancement to the sentences was articulated by the then Acting Minister for Manpower Mr Tan Chua-Jin during the second reading of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Amendment) Bill (Bill 22 of 2012) (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (11 September 2012), vol 89):

> Employers in Singapore are by and large responsible, but there are some who seek to profit by circumventing our work pass framework. **As we further tighten the policies on the hiring and retention of foreign manpower, we can expect errant employers to try harder to get round the rules**… **For example, we have found that some declaring higher salaries than they are actually paying their foreign workers…**

> **Singaporeans ultimately suffer when employers** fail to pay the true costs of hiring foreign manpower or hiring foreign manpower that they are not entitled to. **Local workers will lose out in employment opportunities. Honest employers who play by the rules are also unfairly disadvantaged…**

> Sir, the proposed amendments to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act will enhance the Government’s ability to ensure the integrity of our work pass framework. Recognising that EFMA contraventions range widely from administrative infringements to criminal offences, these amendments will introduce a calibrated and appropriate response to different types of contraventions. **In totality, the changes will allow my Ministry to step up enforcement actions against errant employers**, errant foreign workers and syndicates more expeditiously and effectively, **thereby enhancing deterrence against EFMA contraventions, which ultimately hurts Singaporeans**.

> **To further enhance deterrence, we will increase maximum penalties for EFMA contraventions …**

> Sir, as mentioned, this Bill is meant to go after errant employers, and most employers are fair and responsible. It ultimately bolsters our efforts in creating sustainable and inclusive growth in Singapore and ensuring that Singaporeans remain the core of our workforce. **It will do so by ensuring employers pay the true costs of hiring foreign workers and creating a level playing field for law-abiding employers…**” \[**Emphasis mine**\]

33     In _Chiew Kok Chai_, Abdullah J scrutinised the legislative objective of the EFMA. He held at \[36\] that the EFMA aimed to protect the work pass framework by imposing deterrence sentences and that offences involving deception justified stiffer penalties. He held that the legislative history of s 22(1)(d) reflected Parliament’s intention to deter such offences involving deception with stiff sentences: _Chiew Kok Chai_ at \[37\] to \[40\].

34     Having analysed the legislative objectives of the amendments to s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA, Abdullah J found that the predominant sentencing consideration for an offence under s 22(1)(d) was deterrence: _Chiew Kok Chai_ at \[49\]. He endorsed Chao JA’s statements in _Lim Kopi Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 413</span> at \[10\] and \[11\]: that deterrence was necessary to prevent the very object of the EFMA from being flagrantly undermined and that deception of a public institution that frustrates the aims of the EFMA should not be condoned: _Chiew Kok Chai_ at \[49\].

35     Abdullah J held that, as there was a significant wider interest to protect and where economic benefits may give rise to incentives to breach the provisions of the EFMA, a fine would generally be insufficient to deter would-be offenders. He took the view that the imposition of fines for these offences may encourage offenders to treat contraventions of s 22(1)(d) as mere business costs. As such he concluded that a “custodial sentence should be the norm for offences under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA”. Further, he found that a fine would be insufficient as a punishment unless “substantial mitigating factors” were present: _Chiew Kok Chai_ at \[50\] to \[52\].

36     Abdullah J also found that retribution featured as a sentencing consideration for s 22(1)(d) offences and that this further justified the imposition of a custodial sentence as a starting point: _Chiew Kok Chai_ at \[53\].

37     It was abundantly clear from the Parliamentary Reports and from the decision in _Chiew Kok Chai_ that deterrence and to some extent retribution were the primary sentencing considerations. It follows that I found that these were the sentencing considerations applicable to the present case.

38     I agreed with the Defence’s submission that _Chiew Kok Chai_ had not made a custodial sentence for offences under section 22(1)(d) mandatory involving the work pass framework. However, non-custodial sentences would be the exception and the Court would only consider such sentences if there were substantial mitigating factors.

#### Is an SDO an appropriate sentencing option?

39     Although the Defence submitted that I should impose an SDO as an alternative sentence in the event I found that a fine was inappropriate, I felt that it was more appropriate to deal with this submission first.

40     CBS options, including an SDO, are available as a sentencing option for s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA offences as the offence does not fall within the exceptions stated at s 337(1) CPC.

41     At the outset, I found that the Defence submission that in the event a fine was inappropriate then I should impose an SDO to be somewhat incongruous. By submitting that I should impose a fine, the Defence must have taken the view, as has been clearly held in _Chiew Kok Chai_, that the key sentencing considerations for offences under section 22(1)(d) were deterrence and retribution. The Defence’s did not premise its submission for a fine on issues of rehabilitation coming to the fore. Rather, the Defence submitted that whilst deterrence and retribution were relevant, the offender-specific factors placed the Accused’s offences at the lowest end of Band 1 of the _Chiew Kok Chai_ sentencing framework and, after I considered the offender-specific factors, a non-custodial sentence was appropriate. As such, considerations of rehabilitation do not appear to weigh heavily in the Defence submission.

42     However, by submitting, in the alternative, for an SDO, the Defence appeared to be urging me to consider the Accused’s rehabilitative potential as an important sentencing consideration.

43     The rationale for community based sentencing was enunciated by the Minister for Law and then Second Minister for Home Affairs Mr K Shanmugam during the second reading of the Criminal Procedure Code Bill (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (18 May 2010), vol 87 at col 422):

> CBS gives more flexibility to the Courts. Not every offender should be put in prison**. CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum**, i.e. regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions. For such, cases it is appropriate to harness the resources of the community. The offender remains gainfully employed and his family benefits from the focused treatment. \[**Emphasis mine**\]

44     I accept that an SDO as a form of CBS carries with it an element of deterrence. As stated by See J in _Public Prosecutor v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1163</span> at \[12\] an SDO is not premised purely on a rehabilitative philosophy involving community resources. However, I found that there should be some consideration of the Accused’s rehabilitative potential when considering whether an SDO was appropriate.

45     In _Teo Chang Heng_, the respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of mischief an offence under s 426 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The respondent saw his spouse’s boyfriend driving her car and, consumed by anger and frustration, he committed the offence. See J found that the respondent’s self-reporting of his offence was demonstrably spontaneous and that this reflected genuine remorse and palpable contrition, which was strongly indicative of his potential for rehabilitation and reintegration into society. See J upheld the District Judges sentence of a ten-day SDO and a 120-hour Community Service Order. It was apparent to me that this sentence addressed the needs of both deterrence and rehabilitation.

46     In the present case, the Defence did not put forward any evidence of the Accused’s rehabilitative potential. I agreed with the Prosecution’s oral submission that the imposition of an SDO in the present case, based purely on the mitigating factors raised by the Defence and not on any consideration of the Accused’s rehabilitative potential, would not satisfy the need for general deterrence or retribution, which are the key sentencing considerations for offences under s 22(1)(d). As such, I found that an SDO was not an appropriate sentencing option.

47     I also found that on the facts of the present case, unlike in _Teo Chang Heng_, an SDO would not achieve the need for deterrence and retribution. In _Teo Chang Heng_ at \[17\] to \[18\] See J found that the custodial threshold had been crossed and with the imposition of an SDO the respondent would spend time behind bars. In that case, an SDO still signalled the seriousness of the offence committed by the Respondent. However, See J also held that he might have viewed the sentence differently if the facts of the case warranted a much lengthier custodial sentence for instance of four weeks’ imprisonment.

48     On the facts of the present case, the custodial sentence that the Prosecution sought and that I eventually imposed was far higher than the maximum two weeks’ detention for an SDO. The Prosecution had submitted for a global sentence of 20 weeks’ imprisonment (with individual sentences between 8 weeks and 10 weeks imprisonment) and I had imposed a global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment (with individual sentences between six and nine weeks’ imprisonment). The Prosecution’s submission and the sentence I imposed were based on the facts of this case and those facts warranted a far lengthier sentences that the maximum 14-day sentence that can be imposed under an SDO.

49     Therefore, I found, that an SDO would clearly not achieve the objectives of deterrence and retribution.

#### Clang of the prison gates

50     The Defence premised their argument that an SDO was appropriate on the “clang of prison gates” principle. The Defence submitted that based on the Accused’s social work and contribution he “has been a prominent member of society” and this would justify applying the “clang of prison gates” principle.

51     In _Tan Sai Tiang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 33</span>, Yong CJ held at \[40\]:

> Now, the underlying premise of the “clang of the prison gates” principle is not that where first-time offenders are concerned, the mere fact that a jail sentence has been imposed is punishment enough. The actual basis for the application of this principle is that the shame of going to prison is sufficient punishment for that particular person convicted. As such, in order for the principle to be applicable, the convicted person must have been a person of eminence who had previously held an important position or was of high standing in society. In other words, it would hardly ever apply in most cases dealing with members of society who had never held and important post or were persons of sufficient standing in the eyes of society.

52     This principle was further expounded in _Bachoo Mohan Singh v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 1037</span> where Tay J (as he then was) held at \[74\]:

> … In essence, for the “clang of prison gates” principle to apply, the accused must be an older person in his or her 40s or 50s, is convicted for the first time, and must have previously held an important position or was of high standing in society. The underlying rationale for the application of the “clang of prison gates” principle is that the shame of going to prison is sufficient punishment for the convicted person. The closing of the prison gates behind him or her, regardless of the duration of imprisonment, is sufficient punishment by itself.

53     In _Bachoo Mohan Singh_, the Court convicted the appellant of an offence under s 209 read with s 109 of the Penal Code for intentionally aiding another person to make a claim that he knew to be false. The appellant sought to apply the “clang of prison gates” principle and have his three-month imprisonment sentence reduced to a one-day imprisonment sentence. The appellant, a 61-year old lawyer, had contributed significantly to charity, community work and his profession. Senior members of the legal profession had provided testimonials about the appellant’s good character and professionalism.

54     However, despite the circumstances of the appellant, Tay J did not reduce the sentence to one-day’s imprisonment. In fact, Tay J held at \[75\] that offence of presenting a false claim in court was serious as it struck at the root of justice and that the gravity of the offence was compounded by the fact that the appellant was a senior lawyer. Tay J held that because the conviction would severely affect the appellant’s livelihood because of impending professional disciplinary action this, and other mitigating factors, warranted a discount in the sentence. Tay J reduced the appellant’s sentence to one-month’s imprisonment.

55     However, it did not appear to me that Tay J had applied the “clang of prison gates” principle in his decision to reduce the sentence and this is despite the appellant’s obvious high standing and his societal contributions. With respect, I did not agree that the Accused fell within the category of accused persons identified by Tay J at \[74\] of _Bachoo Mohan Singh._ Whilst the Accused was a successful businessman and it was not disputed that he has contributed to charities, there is no evidence that he has “held an important position or was of a high standing in society” to warrant the application of the “clang of prison gates” principle. With the exception of a letter from the Sikh Welfare Council[^3], the Accused has not exhibited any other documents and/or testimonials to attest to his claim that he is a “prominent member of society”.

56     I noted that it was not uncommon for offenders charged with making false statements under s 22(1)(d) to be director(s) of company(ies). This fact alone should not raise an offender to the status of a “prominent member of society”.

57     Regarding the Accused’s social work and contributions being evidence that he was a “prominent member of society” I noted the Accused has stated that he is a regular donor to the NKF, the Handicap Welfare Association and to a fund administered by the Sikh Welfare Council. The Accused annexed a letter from the Sikh Welfare Council indicating that the Accused was a regular donor, however, there were no other documents from the other charitable organisations indicating that the Accused was a long-standing or regular contributor.

58     The mitigating weight to be attached to a person’s charitable or other unspecified good works was addressed by the Court of Three Judges in _Ang Peng Thiam v Singapore Medical Council and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 143</span>. In that case, the respondent had made significant contributions to society, including serving the Singapore Cancer Society for 26 years, having raised funds for needy patients and made significant contributions in public education. For his contributions, the respondent had been nominated for a National Day Award: _Ang Peng Thiam_ at \[96\].

59     Addressing the weight to be attached to the respondents charitable works, Menon CJ stated at \[101\] that:

> We therefore reject the view that an offender’s general good character, or his past contributions to society (such as volunteer work and contribution to charities) can be regarded as a mitigating factor in so far as this rest on the notion that it reflects the moral worth of the offender. First it is not the place of the court to judge the moral worth of those who are before it. Second, such considerations will generally have no relevance to the offender’s culpability or the harm that he has caused by commission of the offence for which he is being sentenced. Third, as observed in _Mitigation and Aggravation in Sentencing_ at p 11, treating contributions to society as mitigating may be perceived as unfairly favouring the privileged who will be more likely to be able to make such contributions because of their station in life, than will be the case with less privileged offenders.

60     Therefore, the concept of an offender’s previous charitable works as a mitigating factor is of limited application. Limited weight might be given to such works if they were sufficient to demonstrate that the offence in question was a one-off aberration and thus displace the need for specific deterrence: _Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 671</span> at \[24\]. In the present case, I found that the Accused’s charitable works would have limited mitigating value let alone much weight as a factor to consider whether the “clang of prisons gate” principle was applicable.

61     I found that there was no evidence to suggest that the Accused was a person as prominent as the appellant in _Bachoo Mohan Singh_, i.e. there was no evidence that the Accused had contributed “significantly to charity, community work and his profession”. In _Siah Ooi Choe v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1988\] 1 SLR(R) 309</span>, Thean J (as he then was) applied the “clang of prison gates” principle and reduced the appellants sentence from nine months’ to three months’ imprisonment. Thean J described the appellant, his contributions and his standing at \[4\] of the decision. I found that the Accused in the present case does not exhibit similar characteristics to the appellant in _Siah Ooi Choe_.

62     For the reasons above, I found that the “clang of prison gates” principle was not applicable in the present case.

#### Sentencing framework from Chiew Kok Chai

63     Having found in _Chiew Kok Chai_, at \[52\] and \[62\], that a custodial sentence should be the starting point for offences under s 22(1)(d) involving work pass applications or renewals, Abdullah J held, at \[63\], that the length of the sentence should be calibrated using the “two-step sentencing band approach”. Abdullah J, at \[63\], adopted the sentencing bands proposed by the Prosecution which are reproduced below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="13.64%"> <col width="57.28%"> <col width="29.08%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Elaboration</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lower end of the spectrum, involving one or very few offence-specific factors, or where offence-specific factors were not present to a significant degree</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Short custodial sentence of less than five months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Middle band of the spectrum, involving higher levels of seriousness or harm, comprising cases falling between Bands 1 and 3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Five to 15 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Higher end of the spectrum, involving numerous offence-specific factors, or were offence-specific factor were present to a significant degree.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

64     Abdullah J held, at \[67\], that at the first step the Court should consider offence-specific factors including:

> (a)     The materiality of the false representation on the mind of the decision maker;

> (b)     The nature, sophistication and extent of the deception;

> (c)     The consequences of the deception, which includes a consideration of the level of exploitation of the foreign workers, the use of public resources required to uncover and investigate the offence; whether better qualified applicants were deprived of a job opportunity and whether others were put at risk as a result of an unqualified foreigner performing the job;

> (d)     Whether there was a transnational element or the offence was syndicated;

> (e)     The specific role played by the accused and the number of people involved in the offence;

> (f)     Whether the offender obtained gains (financial or otherwise) from the commission of the offence; and

> (g)     The motive of the offender in circumventing the work pass framework.

65     After the Court had ascertained the gravity of the offence, the Court was to place the offence within the appropriate band. The Prosecution has submitted, and I have accepted, that the Court should decide an indicative starting sentence after the first step. At the second step, the Court would take into account offender-specific factors i.e. the personal mitigating factors and aggravating factors: _Chiew Kok Chai_ at \[68\] and \[75\].

#### Application of the sentencing framework to the present case

##### (1)   Offender-specific factors

66      **Materiality of the false statement.** I found that the false statements had an impact on WPD and its decision to issue the foreign workers with S-Passes, in that but for the false statement on the salaries WPD would not have issued the foreign workers with the S-Passes. The Defence did not submit that this factor was absent.

67      **The nature, sophistication and extent of the deception.** I agreed with the Prosecution that the deception was conscious, planned and deliberate. The Accused had never intended to pay the foreign workers the declared salary and had instead made the false statements in order to ensure that the Company would be successful in its application for S-Passes for the foreign workers.

68     I found that the scheme that the Accused had utilised was sophisticated. Every month the Company would credit the foreign workers’ bank accounts **with their declared salary**. The foreign workers would then be required to withdraw the portion of salary that the Company had overpaid them, i.e. the difference between their declared salary and their actual salary, and repay this amount to the company. I found that the Accused had consented to the creation of a false paper trail to disguise the fact that the Company was not paying the foreign workers their declared salaries.

69     The only conceivable reason why the Company would utilise this form of clawback scheme would be to give the impression to the authorities that the Company had paid the foreign workers their declared salaries and that the workers were entitled to the S-Passes that MOM had issued.

70     In the present case, there was an additional level of sophistication to the deception as the Company had also issued the foreign workers with two employment contracts, one that stated the declared salaries and another that stated the actual salaries. Again, there could be no conceivable reason why the Company would do this except to be able to show the contracts with the declared salary to the authorities to substantiate the claim that they paid the foreign workers their declared salaries. I found that there was a high level of sophistication to the scheme utilised by the Accused.

71     I disagreed with the Defence’s submissions that the scheme was unsophisticated and that the use of the two contracts was not aggravating, as it was merely to document the salary that each foreign worker was paid. If this was the case, and if this was an unsophisticated scheme, then the Company should have prepared a single contract that stated the actual salary and then paid that salary to the foreign workers without the need for a clawback. In such a situation, the deception would have been discoverable on a cursory inspection by the authorities. I found that the fact that the Accused utilised this scheme must have been because he wanted to increase the chances that the authorities would not detect the Company’s over-declaration of the foreign workers’ salaries.

72     The fact that the Accused utilised a sophisticated scheme to commit the offences would warrant an uplift to the indicative starting sentence.

73     The difficulty in detection of this deception was highlighted by the fact that the deception was maintained for a considerable period, between three months and 15 months (and up to 21 months if the periods in the TIC charges are taken into account). The difficulty in detection was warrant an uplift to the indicative starting sentence.

74     The Defence submitted that the difference in the salary between the declared and actual salary was not large. As shown at paragraph 8 above the difference between the declared salary and the actual salary in the proceeded charges ranged from $300 to $600 per month. I would accept that the underpayment in this case was not as high as the underpayments stated in the precedents relied upon by the Defence[^4]. However, I found that the amount of underpayment is merely one consideration under this offence-specific factor and on its own was insufficient to justify an indicative starting sentence as the lowest end of Band 1 or a non-custodial starting sentence, especially in view of the fact that other factors justified a higher indicative starting sentence.

75     In any case, I noted that the Defence’s precedents were all decided **before** the decision in _Chiew Kok Chai_ and, I found, were of limited value as precedents. It is arguable that if these cases were decided after _Chiew Kok Chai_ then more severe sentences would have been imposed taking into account the fact that the underpayment was very large. As such, I placed little weight in those cases.

76      **The consequences of the deception.** The Accused was the type of errant employer that the amendments to the EFMA in 2012 were enacted to address. By making the false statements and not paying the foreign workers their declared salaries the Accused was avoiding paying the true costs of hiring foreign workers. Honest employers who played by the rules and paid their foreign employees their declared salaries would be at a disadvantage to the Accused and his Company.

77     I also found that the Accused’s explanation that he had underpaid the new foreign workers to avoid unhappiness amongst the existing employees did not warrant a reduction in the indicative starting sentence.

78     In fact, this rationale demonstrated how the Accused’s existing employees and the new foreign workers would both suffer as instead of increasing the existing employees’ salaries to ensure that they were paid more or that they would not be unhappy with the new foreign workers starting salaries, he instead reduced the new foreign workers salaries. In such a situation, both the existing employees and the new foreign workers stood to lose. The only entity that gained out of this arrangement was the Company as it was able to lower its employment costs.

79     I accepted the Defence submission that there was no overt exploitation of the foreign workers. The foreign workers were all aware that the Company would not pay them their declared salaries before they came to Singapore. This is in contrast to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Son Mi Jun_ MAC 907771 to 907792 of 2017. In that case, there was real exploitation of the foreign workers as the Accused only informed that they would receive lower salaries after they had arrived in Singapore. The foreign workers had to accept the lower salaries failing which the Accused had threatened to repatriate the workers. In this respect, the current case is clearly less egregious than _Son Mi Jun._

80     In _Son Mi Jun_ the offender was sentenced a fine of $9,000 per charge. However, as stated at paragraph 75 above, _Son Mi Jun_ was decided before the decision in _Chiew Kok Chai_. It would be safe to assume that if a Court had heard _Son Mi Jun_ post-_Chiew Kok Chai_ the sentence would be far more severe. As such, I found that _Son Mi Jun_ had no value as a precedent. Had this form of overt exploitation existed in the present case, I would have considered a far higher indicative starting sentence or placing the Accused’s offences in Band 2 rather than Band 1 of the _Chiew Kok Chai_ sentencing framework.

81     I also considered the period that the deception was maintained as being indicative of the extent of the consequences of the deception. The longer the deception was maintained the greater the potential losses to Singaporeans and foreign workers. In the present case the length of the deception ranged from three to 15 months.

82     The Defence has also argued that the foreign workers were not poorly paid and that the Company paid them close to the minimum salary of $2,200 required by MOM for S-Pass holders. The Defence that the Company gave wage increments to two of the workers such that the Company eventually paid them more than what was declared to MOM[^5]. The Defence did not provide any details as to when the Company gave the increment, the eventual salary that these workers were paid and how long the Company employed them under the increased salary. One of the workers, Ansari Nadeem Ahmed Nasir Ahmed, is the subject of a proceeded charge, see paragraphs 5 and 8, and he the Company underpaid him by $350 per month for 15 months. I found that it is not mitigating to claim that the Company eventually paid this worker more than the declared salary. In any case, the Defence submission on this point was to emphasise that there was no overt exploitation of the foreign workers. I have accepted the submission that there was no overt exploitation.

83      **Specific role played by the Accused.** I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused was the mastermind of the scheme. However, I also noted that there was no evidence that the Accused had roped in any other employees in carrying out the scheme.

84      **Gains from the offence.** I accepted that the Accused did not personally profit from the scheme. However, by underpaying the foreign workers the Accused had allowed the Company to make financial gains. The Prosecution calculated that for the proceeding charges the total amount underpaid, and thus the gain to the company, amounted to $18,350. Whilst this was not an inconsiderable sum, I did accept that the gains made by the Company were not as large as in some of the precedent cases.

85      **The Accused’s motive.** According to the Defence, the Accused’s motive was to prevent tension between the foreign workers and the Company’s existing employees. As stated at paragraphs 77 and 78 I did not find that this motive would warrant a reduction in the indicative starting sentence. However, I accepted that the Accused did not have any other motive, for instance a lack of quota for work pass holder, to commit the offence that would result in an uplift to the indicative starting sentence.

##### (2)   Indicative starting sentence

86     I found that the five offence-specific factors were present in this case and I found that the indicative starting sentence for the offences should be at the mid-point of Band 1. I also agreed that there should be a slight adjustment made to the indicative starting sentence for each offence to account for the differing periods of deception.

87     The Defence submitted that the offences by the Accused were less egregious than the offences committed by the appellant in _Chiew Kok Chai_. Whilst I accepted that unlike the appellant in _Chiew Kok Chai_ the Accused person did not commit the offence because the Company was not entitled to manpower quota and that there was no conspiracy involving another person, I nonetheless found that the present case was more egregious than _Chiew Kok Chai_.

88     The scale of the deception in the present case was greater than in _Chiew Kok_ Chai both in terms of the number of foreign workers affected and in terms of the length of the deception. In addition, I found that the level of sophistication in the present case, as discussed at paragraphs 68 to 70 above, was higher than in _Chiew Kok Chai._ Therefore, I found that the indicative starting sentences in the present case should be longer than the indicative starting sentence of two months’ imprisonment held by Abdullah J, at \[75\] to be appropriate in _Chiew Kok Chai._

89     I found that the indicative starting sentences should be as follows:

> (a)     MAC 901059 of 2019 (period of deception 12 months): ten weeks’ imprisonment;

> (b)     MAC 901062 of 2019 (period of deception ten months): ten weeks’ imprisonment;

> (c)     MAC 901063 of 2019 (period of deception three months): eight weeks’ imprisonment;

> (d)     MAC 901066 of 2019 (period of deception four months): eight weeks’ imprisonment; and

> (e)     MAC 901067 of 2019 (period of deception 15 months): 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

##### (3)   Offender-specific factors

90     The primary aggravating factor was that the Accused consented to the Court taking an additional ten charges under s 22(1)(d) into consideration for sentencing. Eight of the TIC charges related to four additional foreign workers, therefore, the Accused’s scheme affected nine foreign workers. I found that this aggravating factor would result in an uplift to the indicative starting sentence.

91     With regard to the mitigating factors, I accepted that the Accused had made full restitution to all the foreign workers affected by the scheme (including the workers in the TIC charges). In all, the Company had paid over $59,000 in restitution to the foreign workers. This was a strong mitigating factor and I found that it would warrant a discount to the indicative starting sentence.

92     I accepted that the Accused was a first-time offender and had been cooperative with MOM during the investigation. In addition, the Accused had elected to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity and this was indicative of a genuine sense of remorse on his part. I accepted that these factors would also warrant a discount to the indicative starting sentence. However, whilst the Accused’s devotion to his son, Pavanjit, and to her mother is commendable, as a mitigating factor his family situation is not so exceptional such as to carry much mitigating weight. Similarly, I found, for the reasons stated at paragraphs 58 to 61, that the Accused’s donations to charity do not carry much mitigating weight. I did not find that the Accused’s age was a mitigating factor.

93     I did not find that there were “substantial mitigating factors” that would warrant the imposition of a fine. I also found that a fine in this case would undoubtedly just be a business cost to the Accused and would not achieve the aims of deterrence and retribution.

94     Having balanced the aggravating and the mitigation factors, I applied a discount of approximately 25% to 30% to the indicative starting sentences. I sentenced the Accused as follows:

> (a)     MAC 901059 of 2019: seven weeks’ imprisonment;

> (b)     MAC 901062 of 2019: seven weeks’ imprisonment;

> (c)     MAC 901063 of 2019: six weeks’ imprisonment;

> (d)     MAC 901066 of 2019: six weeks’ imprisonment; and

> (e)     MAC 901067 of 2019: nine weeks’ imprisonment.

95     I ordered the sentences for MAC 901059 and MAC 901067 to run consecutively. The total sentence was 16 weeks’ imprisonment.

#### Precedents

96     As stated above I did not place much reliance in the Defence’s sentencing submissions as all these cases pre-dated _Chiew Kok Chai_. With regard to the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents, I agreed that _Public Prosecutor v Tan Lee Hwa_ MAC 908050 to 908061 of 2018 was instructive. I found that based on the description of the factors in the table of sentencing precedents that the offences in _Tan Lee Hwa_ was slightly more egregious than in the present case and that the global sentence for the offences in the present case should be lower than the global sentence in _Tan Lee Hwa._

## Conclusion

97     In summary, I found that an SDO was not an appropriate sentencing option in the present case.

98     I also found that based on the offence-specific factors the indicative starting sentence for the Accused was at the mid-point of Band 1. I disagreed with the Defence contention that on the facts of this case the indicative starting sentence should be at the lowest end of Band 1. The mitigating factors that I took into account were not so exceptional that they warranted the imposition of a non-custodial sentence. As such, I found that a fine of $15,000 for these offences would have been inadequate.

99     I found that a global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment was not disproportionate to the scale of the Accused’s offending and it was not a crushing sentence.

100    Finally, I would express my gratitude to the Prosecution and Defence for their well-reasoned arguments, both written and oral, and the invaluable assistance that they rendered to me.
