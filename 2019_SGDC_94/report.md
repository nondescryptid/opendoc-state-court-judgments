\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9081/2019/01.\]

15 May 2019

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

1       Mr Theo Teo Leng, a Singaporean currently 54 years of age, was arrested on 17 May 2018 on suspicion of having consumed drugs. He ran away while police officers were conducting a spot check on him and his friend. He was detained shortly after. Reasonable force had to be used as he put up a struggle. His urine specimen was subsequently procured and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”) for analysis. Upon analysis the urine was found to contain monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine, both of which are controlled drugs under the _Misuse of Drugs Act_ (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”).

2       The defendant was subsequently charged with the consumption of both drugs. He claimed trial. The prosecution proceeded on two charges at the trial relating to the unauthorised consumption of the drugs. His initial defence at the pre-trial stage was that he had consumed certain medication which may have led to the drugs being found in his urine. At the trial, on 15 April 2019, he did not pursue that line of defence. He alleged, instead, that the officers who gave him water to drink prior to the taking of his urine specimen may have put the drugs in the water.

3       The defendant was found guilty and convicted on both charges. On 16 April 2019 he was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment. He filed the present appeal against his conviction and sentence the next day. He is currently serving the sentence.

4       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charges

5       The defendant faced the following two charges at trial:

> DAC-918447-2018 (1st Charge)

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on or before the 17th day of May 2018, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, **monoacetylmorphine**, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). \[...\]

> DAC-918448-2018 (2nd Charge)

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on or before the 17th day of May 2018, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, **methamphetamine**, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). \[...\]

#### Prosecution’s case

#### (a)   Arrest of defendant

6       The defendant was arrested on 17 May 2018 at about 11.30 pm.

7       Two of the police officers involved in the arrest were Sergeant Muhammad Fitri Bin Abdul Latif (PW2) and Sergeant Jonathan Lim Zi Xuan (PW3). They testified[^1] that at that time they were patrolling along Siglap Road in a patrol car when they spotted the defendant and a lady outside 578 Siglap Road, behind a bush. The officers stopped the car and alighted to conduct a spot-check. They screened the defendant and the lady and discovered that both had antecedents for drug offences. The officers proceeded to conduct a search. The lady’s handbag was searched, and a utensil for drug consumption was found inside the bag.

8       At that point the defendant ran away, and the officers gave chase. They managed to stop the defendant, and he put up a struggle. The officers used necessary force to detain the defendant. Both officers suffered minor injuries, and the defendant was also injured. An ambulance was called. After the ambulance had attended to the defendant he was placed under arrest.

9       The defendant was taken to the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters, and an arrest report was prepared (Exh P1).

#### (b)   Procurement of defendant’s urine specimens

10     The defendant’s urine specimen was subsequently procured.

11     Sergeant Ng Kok Wah Ken (PW4, “**Sgt Ken**”) was on duty at the lockup. He testified[^2] that on 18 May 2018, he escorted the defendant to procure a urine specimen. First he escorted the defendant to wash his hands. Then he brought the defendant to a room where the urine bottles were stocked. He asked the defendant to choose one master bottle with a red cap (from among more than ten such bottles) (the “**red bottle**”), and two bottles with blue caps (from among more than 20 such bottles) (the “**blue bottles**”). The bottles were all new, and each bottle was sealed inside a plastic bag.

12     Sgt Ken then led the defendant to a remand cell to procure the urine. The defendant opened the red bottle and provided his urine into it. After that he was asked to pour urine from the red bottle into the two blue bottles. The bottles were then capped, and Sgt Ken taped over them with masking tape to prevent leakage. The red bottle was placed inside a polymer bag; and the two blue bottles were placed inside another polymer bag. The defendant was then escorted to the temporary holding area.

#### (c)   Instant urine test (IUT)

13     An Instant Urine Test (“**IUT**”) was then conducted on the urine specimen.

14     Station Inspector Lee Seng Kui (PW5, “**SI Lee**”) testified[^3] that he conducted the IUT on the defendant’s urine specimen. The defendant was holding on to his urine specimens. SI Lee took the polymer bag that contained the red bottle. He cut open the polymer bag and used a siphon to take urine from the bottle and transferred it into a test-tube. He labelled the test tube with the defendant’s name and NRIC number. The test tube was then put into the IUT machine and processed. The urine specimen tested positive for amphetamines and opiates. SI Lee printed out the IUT result slip (Exh P2).

15     SI Lee also printed out two stickers bearing the name and NRIC number of the defendant. The defendant was asked to check the two stickers to verify that the details were correct. The defendant confirmed that they were correct and signed on each sticker. After that SI Lee took the polymer bag with the two blue bottles from the defendant. He cut the polymer bag and took out the two blue bottles, and taped around the two bottles with masking tape. He placed a sticker on each bottle, over the masking tape.

16     The defendant was subsequently instructed to deposit the blue bottles with the urine specimens into a locked metal container.

#### (d)   Analysis of the urine specimens by HSA analysts

17     Later that day (18 May 2018) the locked metal container with the urine specimens was sent by CNB officer Staff Sergeant Low Chee Tong (PW6) to the HSA for analysis.

18     The urine specimens were subsequently analysed separately by two analysts from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, Zhang Huifen Hannah (PW10) and Chang Hian Twan (PW11) (the “**HSA analysts**”). Upon analysis, the defendant’s urine specimens were found to contain monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine.[^4] The presence of monoacetylmorphine was consistent with the consumption of diamorphine or heroin; and the presence of methamphetamine was consistent with the consumption of ‘ice’ (street name for methamphetamine). The relevant certificates prepared by the two HSA analysts under s 16 of the MDA were admitted in evidence (Exhs P7, P8, P9 and P10).

19     The HSA analysts were also asked to comment on a list of medication prescribed to the defendant by the Tan Tock Seng Hospital in 2017. (The list of medication was set out in a medical report issued by the hospital dated 22 January 2019 – Exh P6). It was the unanimous opinion of both HSA analysts that consumption of the medication would not give rise to monoacetylmorphine or methamphetamine in the urine.

#### (e)   Presumption of consumption under s 22 MDA

20     Given that the defendant’s urine specimen tested positive for monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine, the defendant was presumed under s 22 of the MDA to have consumed the drugs, until the contrary is proved. Section 22 provides as follows:

> Presumption relating to urine test

> 22.    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b) \[i.e., urine tests conducted by analysts of the HSA\], _he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug_ in contravention of section 8(b).

#### (f)   Confessions in defendant’s statement

21     In addition to the presumption under s 22 MDA, the prosecution also relied on a statement recorded from the defendant on 18 May 2018, the day after his arrest (Exh P3). The defendant did not allege that the statement was recorded under any specific threat, inducement or promise; but he disputed the accuracy of its contents.

22     The statement contained, among other things, a detailed confession by the defendant regarding his abuse heroin and ‘ice’. Para 5 of the statement stated as follows:

> 5    Pertaining to my urine sample tested positive for Amphetamine and Opiates, _the last time I smoke ice and heroin was yesterday, 17/5/2018. I smoked alone at my unit_ but I cannot remembered what time I smoked. I smoked both but I cannot remember which I smoked first and how many puffs I had took. _I smoked both ice and heroin using “Chasing” method, by placing the ice and heroin on a aluminium foil and heat it up using a lighter then inhaled using a rolled up paper._ I felt relaxed and energetic after smoking. I would smoked 1 straw of heroin and 1 small packet of ice everyday, and I relapsed back to smoking of ice and heroin everyday ever since I stopped coming to Bedok for my urine reporting since 8/12/2017. I do not have any heroin and ice at home as I had finished off everything yesterday, 17/5/2018. After I smoked, I went down to the void deck to meet Ah J which we were then arrested together by the police.

\[ _Emphasis_ added\]

23     The statement was recorded by Sergeant (CNB) Guan Zhenfu (PW7, the “**recording officer**”). He testified[^5] that the statement was recorded on 18 May 2018 at around 11.20 am. He spoke to the defendant in Mandarin. The statement was typed in English. After the statement was recorded it was read back to the defendant in Mandarin. The defendant was given a chance to make any amendment, addition or deletion. There were amendments at paras 2, 5 and 7. The recording officer added that at para 2, the word “smoking” should not be there, but the cancellation had (inadvertently) not been made.[^6]

24     The recording officer further testified that during the recording of the statement the defendant was compliant and showed no signs of stress. The contents of the statement came from the defendant.

#### Defence

25     The defendant was called upon to enter his defence.

26     In his testimony[^7], the defendant asserted that he did not smoke heroin or ‘ice’ at all. As to why his urine specimen was found to contain the drugs, he thought it could be due to the water consumed by him, which had been provided by the officers just before the urine test was conducted.

27     He also disputed the confessions in his statement. He disputed telling the recording officer that he smoked the drugs alone in his unit (para 5). He said he told the recording officer that he did not consume drugs, but the officer kept saying that he did consume, so his denial was of no use. He also said that other portions of the statement (paras 6 and 7) were incorrect. He signed the statement (despite the inaccuracies) as he was feeling very tired and he wanted the recording process to be over so he could rest. He was told that after signing the statement he would be allowed to rest. He also thought that after the HSA result was out he would be released, as it would prove his innocence. So he did not care too much about whatever was written in the statement.

#### Decision

#### (a)   Presumption of consumption had not been rebutted

28     Having considered the totality of the evidence, including the testimony of the defendant, I found that the defendant had not rebutted the presumption under s 22 MDA that he had consumed the drugs.

29     I found that the defendant’s urine specimen had been properly procured. In his defence, the defendant sought to cast doubt by saying that the officers who offered him water before his urine specimen was procured could have put the drugs into the water. He provided, however, no cogent evidence of such a possibility. He did not question any of the officers who came to testify about such a possibility. Under cross-examination, he said that he was served by a number of officers and he did not know who put drugs into the water. He also conceded that when his Case for the Defence was filed in October 2018 (five months after his arrest) under the criminal case disclosure process, he did not make mention of anyone putting drugs into the water.[^8]

30     I found the defendant’s assertion plainly to be an afterthought and wholly incredible. On the evidence, it was clear that the defendant’s urine specimen had been properly procured and subsequently analysed. The defendant had not rebutted the presumption under s 22 MDA.

#### (b)   Defendant had voluntarily confessed in his statement

31     Further, I found that the defendant did voluntarily confess in his statement to having consumed the drugs (above, at \[22\]).

32     At the trial, the defendant sought to cast doubt on the accuracy of his statement (above, at \[27\]). I did not find his evidence to be credible. He was plainly aware that he faced severe enhanced punishments (LT-1) for the offences.[^9] It was simply illogical and unbelievable that he would give a statement that provided details of drug consumption that were self-incriminatory if there was no truth to it at all. His claim that he signed the statement out of convenience as he wanted to rest was not credible. On the other hand, I found the evidence of the recording officer, that the contents of the statement were provided by the defendant voluntarily, to be credible.

#### (c)   Verdict

33     Accordingly, I found that the prosecution had proven the two charges against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant was found guilty and convicted on both charges.

## SENTENCE

#### Antecedents

35     Additionally, the defendant was admitted into a drug rehabilitation centre (DRC) on 17 March 1995 for a period of 6 months for an offence of consumption of morphine (Exh P5).

36     Given the defendant’s prior admission to the DRC on 17 March 1995 and his conviction on 15 December 2014 for the consumption of a specified drug (methamphetamine), the defendant now faced an enhanced punishment under s 33A(1) MDA (LT-1). There is a mandatory imprisonment term of between 5 and 7 years. The offence is also punishable with caning, although the defendant was no longer liable to caning given that he was more than 50 years of age.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

37     The prosecution sought a sentence of at least 6 years’ imprisonment per charge. It was submitted that the defendant had raised scandalous and spurious allegations against the officers at the trial. He lacked remorse. Given that there were two charges, he should receive a heavier sentence than a person who faced only one charge. It was also highlighted that the sentence he last received for drug consumption (in 2014) was 4 years’ imprisonment; that lengthy sentence had not been sufficient to deter him.

38     The prosecution did not object to both sentences running concurrently, and also did not seek a term of imprisonment in lieu of caning.

#### Mitigation plea

39     In the defendant’s very brief oral mitigation plea, he pleaded for leniency, seeking to be given a “final chance”. He also asked that his period of remand be taken into account in the sentence.

#### Sentencing considerations

40     In offences relating to the abuse of controlled drugs, the primary sentencing objective is general deterrence. In the present case, given the defendant’s numerous antecedents for drug offences, which included drug consumption, the _specific_ deterrence of the defendant was also an important sentencing consideration.

41     The mandatory minimum imprisonment term for each charge is 5 years. I accepted the prosecution’s submission that given the defendant’s lack of remorse, and the fact that he had been convicted after trial for two charges, a sentence above that mandatory minimum would be appropriate. I also took into account that the defendant’s last sentence for drug consumption was fairly recent (in 2014) and he was sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment on that occasion. He reoffended not long after having served that imprisonment term. There should therefore be an adequate uplift from that sentence to achieve the objective of specific deterrence. Consideration was also given to the fact that the defendant was no longer liable to be caned given his age.

42     Taking into account these considerations, it was my judgment that the sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment sought by the prosecution was fair and appropriate.

#### Sentence imposed

43     Accordingly, the following sentences were imposed:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.5%"> <col width="40.72%"> <col width="38.78%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-918447-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 8(b)(ii) p/u s 33A(1) MDA (monoacetylmorphine)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 years’ imprisonment.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-918448-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 8(b)(ii) p/u s 33A(1) MDA (methamphetamine)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 years’ imprisonment.
