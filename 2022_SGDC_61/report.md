Tort – Negligence  –  Motor Accident – Causation

Evidence – Admissibility of evidence – Findings in Coroner’s Report

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 10/2022.\]

24 March 2022

### District Judge Clement Seah Chi-Ling:

## Introduction

1       The present case involved a fatal motor accident (the “**accident**”) between a power-assisted bicycle (“**PAB**”) ridden by one Heng Hock Kim (the “**Deceased**”) and a motor tipper owned by Second Defendant and driven by the First Defendant (the Second Defendant’s employee). It was not disputed that Second Defendant would be vicariously liable if the First Defendant were found liable, in whole or in part, for the accident.

2       The trial before me was bifurcated. At the end of the trial, I found the First Defendant had been negligent in the driving and control of the motor tipper which led to the accident and the Deceased’s demise. I found no contributory negligence on the part of the Deceased and accordingly held the Defendants wholly liable for the accident. The Defendants are dissatisfied with my decision and have filed the present appeal.

## Background Facts

3       The Plaintiff is the son of the Deceased who died on 18 November 2016, and is the Administrator of the Estate of the Deceased pursuant to the Letters of Administration granted by the Singapore Family Justice Courts.

4       The Plaintiff brought this action for the benefit of: (a) the Estate of the Deceased under Section 10 of the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43) (“the Act”); and (b) all Dependents of the Deceased under Section 20 of the Act and for a claim for bereavement under Section 21 of the Act.

5       The accident happened on 18 November 2016 at or about 10.15 am along Cecil Street in the direction of Collyer Quay, in front of Republic Plaza. Cecil Street is a one-way road with five lanes. At the material time, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry and the traffic volume was heavy[^1].

6       The Deceased was 62 years of age at the time of his death. He worked as a freelance courier and deliveryman and used the PAB in the course of his work.[^2]

7       The First Defendant was 54 years of age at the time of the accident and was the driver of motor-tipper vehicle no. XD4187M (the“**motor-tipper**”). The First Defendant was on his way to collect debris at Equality Plaza for disposal at the Tuas Incineration Plant[^3] when the accident happened. The First Defendant was driving the motor-tipper as the servant and/or agent of the Second Defendant, the owner of the motor-tipper.

## How the accident happened?

8       At around 10.15am on 18 November 2016, the Deceased was riding his PAB along Cecil Street in the direction of Collyer Quay when there was a collision between the PAB and the motor tipper. As a result of the said collision, the Deceased was knocked down and suffered fatal injuries leading to his death.

### Plaintiff’s case

9       The Plaintiff’s case was that the said collision was caused solely and/or contributed to by the negligence of the First Defendant in the driving and/or management of the motor-tipper.

10     The Plaintiff’s case theory was that the Deceased was at all material times in front of the motor tipper when the motor tipper negligently collided into the rear of the PAB. As a result of the impact, the PAB and the Deceased toppled over to the right and eventually went underneath the motor tipper and were run over. The Plaintiff contended that this was borne out by the Cecil Street Video (see below) which showed the PAB travelling in front of the motor tipper, near the front left of the tipper, when the front left portion of the motor tipper collided into the back of the PAB.

11     The Plaintiff’s case was that the First Defendant had been negligent in failing to check his blind spots and had failed to keep a proper look-out or to have any or any sufficient regard for the traffic along Cecil Street. The First Defendant also failed to exercise reasonable care, skill and prudence in the driving of the motor tipper and also failed to keep a proper lookout or maintain a safe distance when approaching the Deceased’s PAB which was on the same road. The accident was consequently caused solely by the negligence of the First Defendant in the driving and management of the motor tipper.

### Defendants’ case

12     The First Defendant denied that the accident was caused by any negligence on his part. The First Defendant averred that he was driving properly and carefully along the left lane of Cecil Street at the material time.

13     The Defendants’ case was that on 18 November 2016 at about 10.15 a.m., the First Defendant was driving the motor tipper along the extreme left lane of Church Street towards Cecil Street and Collyer Quay. The First Defendant then came to a stop at the traffic light junction of Cecil Street and Church Street where he was the second vehicle in the queue[^4].

14     When the traffic lights at the traffic junction of Cecil Street and Church Street turned green, the First Defendant moved off and traversed a left bending curve into Cecil Street. The First Defendant estimated his speed to be no more than 30 kmph[^5]. The First Defendant testified that his intention was to turn left into D’Almeida Street which was about 90 meters ahead of the abovementioned traffic junction[^6].

15     As he was proceeding down Cecil Street, the First Defendant claimed he suddenly heard a sound and felt some movement from the rear of the motor tipper. He thought the suspension of the motor tipper had malfunctioned or there might have been a punctured tyre. He had intended to drive further up to park at a safer place before alighting to check on the motor tipper. However, he then heard another sound from the rear of the motor tipper. He then stopped before the junction leading to D’Almeida Street where he was headed. He alighted from his vehicle, walked to the rear of his motor tipper, and was shocked to see a damaged power assisted bicycle and debris strewn along the extreme left lane with a person lying on the road[^7].

16     The First Defendant stated on affidavit that at all material times prior to the collision, he was unaware of the presence of the PAB. At paragraph 12, the First Defendant stated:

> “12. I wish to state that at all material times, I did not see any PAB approaching on my left side or in front of the Second Defendant’s motor tipper.”[^8]

17     Having viewed the video footages played at trial, the First Defendant’s position was that the Deceased had without any warning or signal, cut into the path of the Second Defendant’s motor-tipper causing the collision. He testified that after navigating the curve from Church Street into Cecil Street, because of the structure of the kerb on the left side of the road, the Deceased had “no more road” for him to travel straight. The Deceased thus “came out” into the path of the motor tipper leading to the collision. The First Defendant’s drawing of the road and kerb configuration right after the turn into Cecil Street was admitted as Exhibit D1.[^9]

## The issues

18     The issue before me before me involved a single dispute of fact, namely - whether the Deceased had been travelling in front of the motor tipper whilst traversing Cecil Street and the First Defendant had then collided into the rear of the PAB; or whether the PAB had suddenly cut into the path of the motor tipper leaving the First Defendant with no opportunity to avert a collision.

## The Evidence

19     Mr. Heng Choon Shin Adrian, the Administrator of the Deceased’s estate, was the sole witness for the Plaintiff’s case at trial. He conceded he did not witness the accident, nor did he have access to any witnesses. He, however, adduced and relied primarily on two CCTV video footages that captured the fatal accident that were provided by the Land Transport Authority (“**LTA**”) pursuant an Order of Court dated 12 November 2019 in these proceedings. The two (2) CCTV cameras were located as follows: -

> (a)     The first CCTV camera was located on the left side of Church Street, at the signalized junction of Church Street adjacent to Cecil Street. The first CCTV footage (the “**Church Street Video**”) was 59 seconds long, and ran from timestamp 10:27:00 to 10:27:59. It captured the motor tipper and the PAB at a much earlier point prior to the collision, i.e. whilst both vehicles were travelling along Church Street.

> (b)     The second CCTV camera was located on the left side of Cecil Street, after D’Almeida Street (the “**Cecil Street Video**”). It was 1 minute and 15 seconds long, and ran from timestamp 10:27:44 to 10:28:59. It captured: (i) the vehicles at the Church Street signalized junction (including the PAB and the motor tipper) moving into Cecil Street, (ii) the moments leading up to the collision, (iii) the PAB toppling in front of the motor tipper and eventually going underneath it, and (iv) the First Defendant stopping and coming down from the motor tipper to check on his motor tipper.

20     There was in fact a 3rd CCTV footage which was played at the coroner’s inquiry convened on or around 20 October 2017 (the “**Coroner’s Inquiry**”). The 3rd CCTV footage was taken from a camera situated at the entrance of the Raffles Place (“**RP**”) MRT Station facing Cecil Street, which was closer in proximity to the location of impact compared to the Cecil Street Video. Based on the Coroner’s Report, the RP CCTV video captured footages of the moments leading up to the accident from a nearer vantage point compared to the Cecil Street Video. Unfortunately, due to the effluxion of time, copies of the RP video footages were no longer available. This court therefore had to rely primarily on the Church Street Video and the Cecil Street Video tendered at trial.

### The Church Street Video

21     As mentioned, the Church Street Video captured the motor tipper and the PAB prior to the motor tipper and the PAB turning into Cecil Street.

22     The Church Street Video showed the First Defendant travelling along the extreme left lane along Church Street in the direction of Cecil Street. The First Defendant then came to a stop before the signalized junction of Church Street at around timestamp \[10:27:01\] as the traffic lights had turned red for vehicles travelling along Church Street in the direction of Cecil Street. While the First Defendant was still stationary, the Deceased’s PAB appeared for the first time at timestamp \[10:27:45\], and was seen riding past the back of motor-tipper on the motor tipper’s left at timestamp \[10:27:50\] before it disappeared from the coverage of the video footage. Some five seconds later, at timestamp \[10:27:55\], the motor tipper started to move off from its stationary position.

### The Cecil Street Video

23     The Cecil Street Video showed the vehicles which had stopped at the signalized junction of Church Street and Cecil Street turning into, and then traversing along, Cecil Street after the Church Street traffic lights had turned green. The First Defendant’s motor tipper and the PAB first appeared at time stamp \[10:28:02\]. At timestamp \[10:28:03\], the PAB was seen toppling to its right before it went underneath the motor tipper and was run over by the motor tipper.

## Findings of Fact

24     The key available video footage that captured the actual moments leading up to the collision between the PAB and the motor tipper was the Cecil Street Video, though the images were not very clear due to the distance of the Cecil Street camera from the point of impact.

25     Having studied the Cecil Street video repeatedly and very carefully, it was clear to me that while traversing Cecil Street, the PAB was directly in front of the motor tipper, near the front left edge of the motor tipper (“**My Finding**”). The front left portion of the motor tipper then collided into the rear of the PAB, causing the Deceased to lose control of the PAB, veer towards the center of the motor tipper and eventually collapse around the centre of the tipper where the deceased and his PAB eventually went underneath the motor tipper.

### The Cecil Street Video

26     My above findings were based largely on my study of the relative positions of the PAB and the motor tipper as depicted in the Cecil Street Video. I placed emphasis on the images at or around timestamp \[10:28:03\] which, based on my observations, showed the motor tipper’s front left hitting the rear of the PAB. This eventually caused the PAB to veer towards the center of the motor tipper before toppling over. Admittedly the Cecil Street Video was taken from a distance and the images were not very clear. However, having studied the footage carefully and multiple times, I concluded, on a balance of probabilities, that: (a) the Deceased’s PAB was indeed directly in front of the motor tipper around the latter’s left edge; (b) the left frontal portion of the motor tipper had then collided into the rear of the PAB; and (iii) there was no discernible evidence of any overtaking or cutting-in by the PAB into the motor tipper’s path.

### Inferences from the Church Street Video

27     While I relied primarily on the Cecil Street video in drawing the above conclusions, there were other supporting evidence which fortified my findings of fact.

28     First, the Church Street video showed the PAB travelling past the motor tipper for a good five seconds while the motor tipper was stationary at the signalized junction between Church Street and Cecil Street. While I agreed with Defendants Counsel that the exact location of the PAB after it had passed by the motor tipper along Church Street was outside the range of the Church Street video camera (and hence it could not be definitively said how far the PAB had travelled ahead of the motor tipper while on Church Street), in the ordinary course of things, the PAB was likely to have ridden some distance ahead of the motor tipper during the intervening five seconds, placing the PAB ahead of the motor tipper before the Church Street junction lights turned green and the vehicles proceeded to turn into Cecil Street. This rendered it likely that the PAB was indeed in front of the motor tipper when the two vehicles were first seen in the Cecil Street video.

### The Coroner’s Report

29     The Coroner’s report issued pursuant to the Coroner’s Inquiry (the “**Coroner’s Report**”) reported a similar account of the relative positions of the two vehicles moments before the impact. The Coroner’s Report, which was prepared with the benefit of the RP MRT Station video clip in addition, noted that: (a) based on the Cecil Street Video the deceased was “cycling on the extreme left lane, _on the front left of Mr Tan’s tipper_”; and (b) based on the RP MRT Station camera, “Mr. Heng was seen travelling _in front of Mr Tan’s tipper_, along the extreme left lane of Cecil Street”.

30     The material portions of the Coroner’s Report are set out below:

> _“15_.     _The camera located along Cecil Street, after D'Almedia Street_, **_showed Mr Heng cycling on the extreme left lane, on the front left of Mr Tan's tipper_**_. Mr Heng was then seen veering towards the front centre of the tipper, and the collision occurred. After the impact, the tipper had proceeded forward, before coming to a complete stop, on the extreme left lane, along Cecil Street (before D'Almeida Street)._

> _Raffles Place MRT Cameras_

> _16_.     _Cameras located at the entrance of Raffles Place MRT, at the right side of Cecil Street, also recorded the progress of the respective vehicles, just before the impact._ **_Mr Heng was seen travelling in front of Mr Tan's tipper, along the extreme left lane of Cecil Street._** _Mr Heng was seen to veer to the centre of the tipper, before the tipper was projected to have run over him and the PAB.”_ **_(emphasis added)_**

#### Evidential Value of Coroner’s Reports in subsequent proceedings

31     In _Great Eastern General Insurance Ltd and another v Next of Kin of Md Sharif Hossain Rana Abdul Malek_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 64</span> (“**_Great Eastern General Insurance Ltd_**”), Mavis Chionh JC (as she then was) held that a Coroner’s Certificate is admissible in subsequent judicial proceedings as evidence of the facts as determined or found by the coroner at the coroner’s inquiry. In coming to this conclusion, Her Honour held that the express provisions of the Coroners Act (Cap 63A, 2012 Rev Ed) (“**CA**”), in particular section 27(2) CA, clearly contemplated that the Coroner’s Certificate could be introduced in subsequent judicial proceedings and be relied upon by the court in those proceedings as the basis of its findings.

32     In response to the appellant in that case’s argument that the Coroner’s Certificate was inadmissible in subsequent judicial proceedings, Her Honour noted at \[16\]-\[17\]:

> “…. the \[Appellants’\] argument ignores the express provisions within the CA which clearly contemplate that the Coroner’s Certificate will be introduced in subsequent judicial proceedings and relied on by the tribunal or court in those proceedings as the basis of its findings. I refer to s 27(2) CA which states:

>> A Coroner at an inquiry shall not frame a finding in such a way as to determine any question of criminal, civil or disciplinary liability but _shall not be inhibited in the discharge of his function by any likelihood of liability being inferred from facts that he determines or recommendations that he makes_.

>> _\[emphasis added\]_

> The italicised words plainly contemplate that a Coroner’s Certificate may be admitted in subsequent judicial proceedings as evidence of the facts as determined or found by him at the coroner’s inquiry. It would not make sense otherwise to talk about the “likelihood of liability being inferred from facts that he determines”. Thus, for example, in _Li Gaiyun suing as the administrator of the estate of Ma Dewu, deceased v Chan Wei Lun Allan_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 53</span>, District Judge Seah Chi Ling made the point that “any factual findings made by the Coroner will be considered by the court in a subsequent civil action” though they will not be “binding or conclusive of any facts in issue in a subsequent civil action” (at \[23\]).

33     The contents of the Coroner’s Report noted at \[30\] above, which are admissible in the current proceedings, are consistent with My Finding that the PAB was directly in front of the motor tipper near its left edge as the vehicles were traversing along Cecil Street prior to the collision.

### Defendants’ contention that the PAB was adjacent to the motor tipper and attempting to overtake the motor tipper

34     The Defendants appeared to suggest that the PAB was in fact adjacent to the tipper and had attempted to catch up with and overtake the motor tipper. As noted in \[17\] above, the Defendants had contended that the Deceased had “run out of road” after navigating the curve leading up to Cecil Street and had thus “come out” into the path of the motor tipper – see also Exhibit D1 as drawn by the First Defendant. In my view, this was no more than pure speculation by the Defendant considering that his testimony throughout was that he never saw the PAB prior to the impact. This hypothesis was also not supported in any way by the Cecil Street Video from which there was no evidence of any attempts by the PAB to overtake the motor tipper.

35     The Defendants’ conjecture was, in any event, improbable in my view, as the Deceased was riding a PAB, while the motor tipper was an engine propelled vehicle capable of moving at a much faster speed. As noted in the Coroner’s Report, the width of the extreme left lane was further such that the deceased would not have been able to ride his PAB and travel adjacent the tipper to overtake the tipper without the risk of side swiping the left side of the tipper[^10]. The Deceased was thus unlikely to have been attempting this manoeuvre, as the Defendants speculated.

36     I also found it noteworthy that in the Coroner’s Report, which was prepared with the benefit of the additional RP MRT video clip, no reference was made to any attempts by the PAB to overtake the motor tipper or to the PAB intentionally cutting into the motor tipper’s path. Indeed, the only two possible causes postulated by the Coroner for the deceased losing control was that: (a) the Defendant had hit the PAB from the rear; or (ii) the deceased had spontaneously lost control of the PAB[^11]. The first paragraph of the Coroner’s conclusion stated as follows:

> _“Conclusion_

> _27_.     _……. On 18 November 2016, sometime before 10.30 am, \[the First Defendant\] was driving his tipper on the extreme left lane of the five-lane road, along Cecil Street towards Collyer Quay, while \[the Deceased\] was cycling on the front left of \[the First Defendant’s\] tipper. In front of Republic Plaza, \[the Deceased\]could be seen from CCTV footage, to lose control of his PAB._ **_This could have been caused either upon a direct \[sic\] collision with \[the First Defendant\]’s tipper, or \[the Deceased\] having spontaneously lost control of his PAB_** _(after completing a turn at the signalised junction of Church Street by Cecil Street), causing him and his PAB to fall underneath the tipper, and be run over by the tipper._ **_\[emphasis added\]_**

37     In my mind, having reviewed the Cecil Street video carefully, I found, on a balance of probabilities, that the first scenario was more likely, _i.e._ Defendant had hit the PAB from the rear while the PAB was all along travelling directly in front of the motor tipper. At the material time, the weather was clear and the road surface was dry[^12]. The Cecil Street Video at \[10:28:03\] showed what appeared to be a contact of the PAB by the motor tipper from the rear before the PAB veered towards the right and toppled over. This version of events was rendered even more likely by the Defendant’s admission that he never saw the PAB at any time along Cecil Street before the impact. Having no cognizance of the presence of the PAB ahead of him, this increased the probability of the Defendant colliding into the rear of the PAB inadvertently.

38     I also disagreed with the Defendants Counsel’s suggestion that if the tipper had collided into the rear of the PAB, the PAB would have “bunted forward”[^13]. This was based solely on conjecture. Depending on the nature and force of the impact to the rear of the PAB, and the instinctive reaction of the rider of the PAB in an attempt to control the PAB post impact, it was impossible to predict what the likely trajectory of the PAB would have been post impact. That the PAB would veer to the right before toppling over almost instantaneously was certainly plausible.

## Accident was caused by the First Defendant’s negligence

39     Based on my finding of fact, the collision was caused by the negligence of the Defendant who had failed to keep a proper look out for the PAB which was travelling in front of him. The negligence of the Defendant was evident from his testimony that he _at no time_ saw the PAB when they were traversing along Cecil Street, notwithstanding the Cecil Street Video clearly showing that the two vehicles were travelling within close proximity of each other:

> Re-examination of First Defendant on 12 October 2021 (pp. 24)

> _“Q_      _Mr. Singh \[Plaintiff’s Counsel\] said to you, “Had you kept a distance from all the vehicles in front of you, you will not have run over the deceased … because you would have easily seen him.” This is and you asked, is---this is an if, and you said it’s a put question, you can agree, disagree, and then say whatever you want to say. And then you responded to Mr. Singh by saying “I agree.” Then you said, “I have something to say.” And Mr. Singh said, “Yes, please.” And then you said, “If I had seen this bicycle in front of me this would not have happened at all.” That is what I wish to say. Okay._ **_My question arising from this, okay, did you see the deceased that morning before the impact. Yes, or no?_**

> _A_      **_No._**

> _Q_      **_Did you see at any point in time where the deceased was in relation to your vehicle that day based on what you saw and heard and felt that day. Did you?_**

> _A_      **_No.”_**

> **_(Emphasis added)_**

40     The Accident reconstructionist, one Mr. Ang Bryan Tani, who was called at the Coroner’s Inquiry opined that based on his simulation exercise to observe the sighting ability of the First Defendant, “the \[the First Defendant\] would likely have been able to see \[the Deceased\] riding his PAB, as the tipper was travelling along the extreme left lane of Cecil Street towards Collyer Quay”. This was so as there were “two blind spot mirrors at the front left of the tipper, \[which\] had provided clear and adequate reflection for the immediate area around the front, and the immediate area adjacent to the front left door of the tipper”[^14]. Thus, “even if \[the Deceased\] was riding his PAB along the left side of the tipper, the driver of the tipper would still have been able to see \[the Deceased\] riding his PAB, through the left wing mirror, and the blind spot mirror, that was for the immediate area adjacent to the front left door of the tipper”[^15].

41     The Defendants contended that as Mr Ang was not called as a witness at the present trial, his testimony proffered at the Coroner’s Inquiry was inadmissible hearsay.

42     I would make three observations in relation to this objection: (a) first, the Coroner’s Report was adduced by the Defendants as evidence in this trial and formed part of the First and Second Defendants’ own Bundle of Documents; (b) _Great Eastern General Insurance Ltd.’s case_ supports the proposition that a Coroner’s Report could be introduced in subsequent judicial proceedings and be relied upon by the court in those proceedings, though the findings therein will not be binding or conclusive of any facts in issue in the subsequent civil action; and (c) the First Defendant was questioned at trial about the mirrors installed on the motor tipper as shown in 2AB12[^16]. In particular, the First Defendant acknowledged that the mirror on front upper left of the tipper which he circled in green[^17] was designed to help the tipper drive see objects in front of the tipper given the size of the tipper[^18]. That the Defendant did not know the tipper was in front at all suggested that Defendant did not check the mirror in question, or at least did not do so adequately, which led to him being unaware that there was a PAB in front of his tipper travelling near to the left kerb.

#### No police action taken

43     I have taken due note of the fact that the police had not taken action against anyone in the present case. It is not for this court to speculate why the police arrived at the decision they did. I would just note that any criminal prosecution would require proof of fault beyond reasonable doubt. In contrast, in a civil lawsuit such as the present, the standard of proof of negligence is lower and is based on a balance of probabilities.

## Contributory Negligence

44     The Defendants have further not shown that the Deceased was contributorily negligent in any way. There was no evidence which suggested that the PAB had cut into the motor tipper’s path. The PAB was further travelling near the extreme left of the lane in line with the relevant traffic regulations. Rule 8 of the Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules promulgated pursuant to the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 276, Section 140) provides as follows:

> **“Bicycle, etc., to be ridden on left side of road**

> **8**.    A person who rides a bicycle, power-assisted bicycle, trishaw or tricycle on a road must ride the bicycle, power-assisted bicycle, trishaw or tricycle as near as practicable to the far left edge of the road.”

45     Based on the Cecil Street Video, the Deceased appeared to be riding on the far left edge of the extreme left lane of Cecil Street in the moments prior to it being collided into by the motor tipper. In the circumstances, no contributory negligence should be ascribed to the Deceased. The accident was caused solely by the First Defendant’s failure to keep a proper look out.

## Judgement

46     Based on the foregoing, I entered interlocutory judgment for the Plaintiff with damages to be assessed. I further ordered awards of costs and interest to be reserved to the assessing judge or registrar.
