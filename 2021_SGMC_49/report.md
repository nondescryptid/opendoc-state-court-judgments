CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND SENTENCING – Sentencing – Penal Code – voluntary causing hurt

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9152/2021/01.\]

29 July 2021

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       The Accused had pleaded guilty to slapping an 8 year old girl in an MRT carriage. The Accused committed the assault because the victim had accidentally stepped on her foot.

## The charge

2       The charge was one under s 323 of the Penal Code, Cap 224. It attracted the enhanced sentencing provision under s 74B(2) of the same Code. The offence was committed on 15 July 2020 at about 1.47 pm when the train was at the Yew Tee MRT Station at 61 Choa Chu Kang Drive.

3       The Accused also consented to take one charge under s 352 of the Penal Code into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. In this charge, she had poked the nose of the victim’s mother on the same day, time and location.

## The Facts

4       The victim was 8 years old at the time of the offence. The Accused accepted that she ought to have reasonably known that the victim was a person below 14 years old.

5       On 15 July 2020, the victim and her mother had boarded the train at Choa Chu Kang MRT station. As she was moving into the carriage, she accidentally stepped on the Accused’s left foot. She apologised to the Accused. The Accused did not hear the victim as she was talking loudly on her mobile phone at the time. Subsequently, the Accused confronted the victim’s mother and asked why the victim had not apologised to her. The mother informed her that the victim had in fact apologised to her earlier. An argument ensued between the Accused and the victim’s mother.

6       The train reached Yew Tee MRT station located at 61 Choa Chu Kang Drive at about 1.47 pm. As the victim and her mother proceeded to exit the carriage, the Accused slapped the victim once on her left cheek as she attempted to prevent the victim from leaving without apologising. The slap caused pain to the victim. She started to cry.

7       The victim suffered a contusion on her left cheek. She was assessed to be well. She was discharged with analgesia and was given two days medical leave from 15 to 16 July 2020. She was also excused from physical activity until 19 July 2020.

## Antecedents

8       The Accused was a first offender.

## Prescribed punishment

9       The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 323 punishable under s 74B(2) Penal Code was imprisonment not exceeding six years, or with fine not exceeding $10,000, or with both.

## Prosecution’s sentencing submission

10     DPP Joseph Gwee submitted that, given that the injury was minor, the case fell within Band 1 (low harm) of the the sentencing framework in _PP v Low Song Chye_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”). Under this sentencing band, the indicative sentencing range was a fine or a custodial term of up to four weeks. DPP Gwee submitted that as the Accused was liable to the enhanced punishment under s 74B(2) of the Penal Code, the indicative sentencing range should be increased by a factor of 1.5.

11     DPP Gwee described the Accused’s reaction as wholly disproportionate and unwarranted. The victim was only 8 year old. The Accused had been angry because she did not hear the victim’s apology. When the victim was leaving the carriage, the Accused had slapped her on the face, which was a vulnerable part of the body. The slap was sufficiently hard to cause a contusion on her cheek and caused her to cry. DPP Gwee described how the Accused then tried to leave after attacking the victim but was prevented from doing so by the victim’s mother by pulling the Accused’s T-shirt.

12     All considered, he submitted that a fine of at least $5,000 was appropriate under the circumstances.

## Mitigation plea

13     Mr Danny Quah, counsel for the Accused, disclosed that at the material time, the Accused was in a slightly agitated state and had spoken loudly because she did not have enough money to pay the monthly premiums for her existing life insurance policy. This was the reason why she had not heard the victim’s apology. He pointed out that because of the aggressive behaviour displayed by the victim’s mother, the situation had escalated, and that led to the assault on the victim.

14     Mr Quah submitted that the appropriate sentence was a fine of of not more than $800 and a short imprisonment term of two days in default. This was because the harm caused was minor. The slap was not a forceful one. It was not premeditated. The Accused was a first offender and she was deeply remorseful of her actions. A higher fine would be excessive. It would be unduly harsh especially because she was the sole breadwinner of her family comprising her elderly mother and youngest brother who was half-blind. Despite these responsibilites, she was not able to commit to full-time work because she tired easily due to her diabetes.

15     Lastly, Mr Quah rejected the prosecution’s submission that pursuant to s 74B(2), a 1.5 multiplier to the sentence was warranted. He argued that the sentence must fit the facts of the case. Mr Quah also highlighted that the Accused had made compensation payment to the victim the sum of $204.40.

## The sentence

16     The present offence fell into Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ sentencing framework The indicative stating range was a fine and up to four weeks’ imprisonment. However, as the offence is punishable under s 74B(2), the maximum fine and imprisonment were now increased two-fold. I was mindful that “where Parliament has enacted a range of possible sentences, it is the duty of the court to ensure that the full spectrum is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence: _Ong Chee Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> (“_Ong Chee Eng_”) at \[24\], and cited with approval by CJ Menon in _Poh Boon Kiat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> at \[60\]. In the same case, CJ Menon further noted that the statutory maximum sentence signalled the gravity with which Parliament viewed any individual offence and that the sentencing judge “ought to note the maximum penalty imposed and then apply his mind to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament” (emphasis mine).

17     I bore the above principles in mind and applied them to the present case. Since the full range of sentencing options should be considered, it followed that the same criminal conduct could attract a higher sentence where the prescribed maximum was enhanced. However, I was mindful that ultimately whether a higher sentence was warranted must still depend on a careful consideration of the gravity of the offending conduct in each case: _Ong Chee Eng_ at \[62\].

18     The purpose of s 74B(2) was to afford additional protection to victims of assaults who were below the age of 14 years old. This was because they fall into the category of vulnerable victims. The case of _PP v Lee Beng Yong @ Muhammad Zaki Lee_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 12</span> (“_Lee Beng Yong_”) was instructive to get a sensing in how the courts treated young victims of assaults by adult offenders. The case involved an assault (a slap) on a nine years old boy. In that case, the offender, a 47 years old male, had slapped his daughter’s 9 years old male classmate for allegedly bullying her. The offence was committed in the daughter’s classroom. The assault caused minor injury to the face. The offender pleaded guilty to one count of s 323. One count under s 447 Penal Code was taken into consideration. He was fined $3,500. On appeal, the sentence was increased to two weeks’ imprisonment. This case clearly showed that there was fundamentally a significant difference between an adult offender slapping another adult and an adult offender slapping a young victim. The former was clearly more egregious and more aggravating.

19     I agreed with DPP Gwee submissions on the aggravating factors present in the present case. These were set out at \[11\] above. In addition, the victim was a vulnerable victim. The Accused’s action was also wholly disproportionate to the alleged “slight” caused to her. However, I did not think that the custodial threshold was not crossed. The facts in the present case were not as egregious as that in _Lee Beng Yong_. A high fine was appropriate and would adequately address the consideration of deterrence. The proposed fine quantum submitted by Mr Quah was manifestly inadequate. The cases which he had relied on in support were distinguishable in that these cases were not punishable under s 74B(2).

20     I noted that the Accused had pleaded guilty. However, I gave little weight to this. The arguments made in the course of the mitigation plea showed very little evidence of genuine remorse. She had tried to minimise the whole incident. I also gave no weight to the compensation that was made because it was made at a very late stage of the court proceedings. In this case, it was made just before she was sentenced.

21     All considered, I agreed with the prosecution on the fine quantum that should be imposed. I therefore fined the Accused $5,000 in default to serve 20 days’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

22     The Accused has lodged an appeal against sentence. She is currently paying the fine in monthly instalments of $500 per month.
