Criminal Law – Statutory offences – Misuse of Drugs Act

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Date of commencement

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9071/2021/01.\]

26 October 2021

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The Accused, Shafie Bin Osman (“Shafie”), had earlier faced cheating charges, unrelated to the charges for which Shafie pleaded guilty before me.

2       In the midst of the trial (before a different district judge) for the cheating charges, Shafie brazenly joined a locally-linked organised criminal group with one Fadilah Bin Haron and two other individuals (collectively, the “OCG”). Shafie was on bail at that time. Shafie knew that one of the purposes of this OCG was the obtaining of financial benefits from the trafficking of 5-fluoro-MDMB-PICA or its fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act.

3       The Prosecution before me in the present case submitted that this particular drug (as stated in \[2\]) is a “synthetic new psychoactive substance (“NPS”) which produces similar effects to cannabis” and that this particular NPS (the “subject NPS”) “is a synthetic cannabinoid”. The introduction of NPS (including the subject NPS) into Singapore in recent times is a worrying aspect in the continuing fight against the dangers of the illicit drug trade. The subject NPS is classified as a Class A controlled drug. It is undoubtedly clear that deterrent sentences would be warranted for offences such as the trafficking of NPS, to prevent the further proliferation of such drugs in our social landscape.

4       Shafie was involved in separate acts of trafficking of the subject NPS. He was arrested in relation to these fresh drug offences. He was charged in Court accordingly and his bail was revoked. Shafie was thus held in remand. These fresh events had occurred during an interval between tranches for the trial for his cheating charges. Shafie then decided to plead guilty in relation to the cheating charges.

5       Shafie pleaded guilty on 8 October 2019 (before a different district judge) to six charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (with three other charges of cheating being taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing). For the six proceeded cheating charges, Shafie was sentenced to (in ascending order of the terms of the individual sentences) imprisonment for terms of eight months, eight months, 12 months, 12 months, 15 months and 24 months. The sentences of 12 months, 12 months and 24 months (that is, for three of the six proceeded charges) were ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence was imprisonment for 48 months, backdated to the date of remand, 18 July 2019.

6       It must be noted that the date Shafie pleaded guilty to, and was sentenced for, the cheating charges, was 8 October 2019. His arrest for the drug charges (the subject matter for these present grounds of decision) had occurred on a date that was less than three months prior to this date. Thus, the drug charges could not have been dealt with at the same time as the cheating charges, as there would have been insufficient time for the prosecution of the drug charges at that point. The reference to “drug charges” and “drug offences” in these Grounds applies to the charges for which Shafie pleaded guilty before me. As can be seen in the table in \[7\], the offence in DAC-935331-2019 (the “proceeded trafficking charge”) is punishable under the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”) read with the Organised Crime Act (“OCA”) which for this particular charge, enhanced the maximum imprisonment term by five years. The offence in DAC-935331-2019 was punishable with mandatory imprisonment for a minimum term of five years coupled with a mandatory minimum five strokes of the cane. The offence in DAC-935332-2019 (the “OCA charge”) related to Shafie’s role in the locally-linked organised criminal group which was concerned with the trafficking of the subject NPS, and was punishable under the OCA. The offence in DAC-935333-2019 (the “consumption charge”) related to Shafie’s illegal consumption of a specified drug and was punishable under the MDA: it carried a mandatory minimum imprisonment sentence of one year.

7       Before me, on 2 March 2021, Shafie pleaded guilty to the three stated charges and admitted and consented to three drug trafficking charges being taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing (the “present TIC charges”). Shafie was represented by Counsel. Shafie was sentenced as follows:

8       The sentences imposed on Shafie were in line with what the Prosecution had sought. The total sentence was **imprisonment for a total term** of **nine years and 6 months**, a **fine of $13,500** (**in default three months’ imprisonment**: the fine was not paid) and **eight strokes of the cane**. With regard the commencement date of the sentence, as Shafie was, at the date I sentenced him, undergoing the sentence of imprisonment for the cheating charges, s 322(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (the “CPC”) would apply.

9       Pursuant to s 322(1) of the CPC, as Shafie was “undergoing a sentence of imprisonment”, the “latter sentence of imprisonment must begin either immediately or at the end of the imprisonment to which he was previously sentenced, as the court awarding the sentence directs”. The Defence did not urge upon the Court that the current sentence being meted out should begin “immediately” (that is, with effect from the date of sentencing). In this case, it was clear that this fresh sentence ought to take effect with effect from the expiry of his sentence for the cheating charges, and I so ordered. The cheating charges for which Shafie had earlier been sentenced for were very different from the drug charges for which he had been convicted before me. To reiterate, the drug offences were committed whilst Shafie was on bail for the cheating charges.

10     In the Mitigation Plea, the Defence made it clear that they were in agreement with the Prosecution’s submission on individual sentences (save for the modification sought; this is elaborated upon, below) and for which sentences were to be ordered to run consecutively. At \[17\] of the Mitigation Plea, the Defence stated, “As such we agree with the Prosecution’s submission as to which sentences should run consecutively and the imprisonment terms sought for each of the respective offences and (_sic_) but only as an indicative starting point.”

11     For the three proceeded charges there were terms of imprisonment imposed for all of them. Pursuant to s 307(1) of the CPC, at least two of the imprisonment terms had to be ordered to run consecutively. The Prosecution and Defence were in agreement that the imprisonment terms for the proceeded trafficking charge and the consumption charge should run consecutively, and that the imprisonment term for the OCA charge should run concurrently. As stated in \[10\], the Defence did not challenge the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence for the individual proceeded charges. What the Defence sought to do, was to persuade the Court to revise the imprisonment term for the proceeded trafficking charge downwards, so as to achieve a lower total imprisonment sentence.

12     There could not be any issue with the sentence meted out for the consumption charge as this sentence (imprisonment for one year) was the mandatory minimum sentence that could be imposed.

13     With regard the sentence for the OCA charge, the Defence had apparently no issue with the imposition of a fine together with an imprisonment sentence. The imposition of a fine was for purposes of disgorging the profits that Shafie had earned from his illegal drug trafficking activities. The sum of $13,500 is derived from \[20\] of the Statement of Facts to which Shafie admitted without qualification, and represents the ill-gotten gains that Shafie obtained from his involvement in the OCG for the period March 2019 to 16 July 2019. The Defence agreed that the fine component be pegged at $13,500. A default term of imprisonment of three months was imposed and applied as Shafie failed to pay this fine. I fixed the default term at three months, after taking into account all the circumstances of the case including the totality of the imprisonment sentences meted out and the quantum of the fine imposed. The default term of three months’ imprisonment for the unpaid fine could not be said to be excessive in the circumstances. As for the imprisonment component of the sentence for the OCA charge, the Defence agreed with the Prosecution’s submission of 16 months’ imprisonment (\[17\] of the Mitigation Plea). This imprisonment sentence of 16 months was to run concurrently.

14     With regard to the imprisonment sentence component for the OCA charge, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission of an imprisonment sentence of at least 16 months. There are apparently no direct authorities or precedents to support this submission. The Prosecution referred to cases where the OCA operated in tandem with charges under the Remote Gambling Act. The Prosecution also submitted on the degree of culpability and harm demonstrated as a result of Shafie’s involvement in the OCG. The Defence did not take issue with the Prosecution’s submission of 16 months’ imprisonment. As mentioned above, both the Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement that the imprisonment sentence for the OCA charge could be made to run concurrently with the other sentences. I agreed with this proposition.

15     We now turn to the sentence for the proceeded trafficking charge. It has to be pointed out, that the Defence had no issue that the sentence of caning be set at eight strokes of the cane. Considering that the mandatory minimum sentence of caning is set at five strokes, this is at least tacit acceptance by the Defence as to the severity of this particular offence.

16     Again, it has to be emphasised that the Defence agreed with the Prosecution’s submission in respect of the “imprisonment terms sought for each of the respective offences” (\[17\] of the Mitigation Plea), but sought a modification of the imprisonment sentence for the proceeded trafficking charge to arrive at the “modified” total sentence that the Defence was seeking.

17     There are apparently no authorities or precedents for trafficking of NPS. The Prosecution referred to cases involving trafficking of drugs such as nimetazepam and ketamine. The Prosecution also referred to a case involving the _possession_ of an NPS (different from the subject NPS).

18     I was persuaded by the Prosecution’s submission that the appropriate imprisonment sentence for the proceeded trafficking charge was eight years (before factoring in the “uplift” in sentence pursuant to the OCA, to which we will return later). Of particular note, was that the amount of the subject NPS (in the proceeded trafficking charge) was large and was contained in 60 packets that were meant to be trafficked. There was also a need to mete out a deterrent sentence to stem the tide of NPS onto our shores – a stern message had to be sent out that NPS ought not to be allowed to gain a foothold in our society.

19     It should be stressed that Shafie also faced three other separate charges of trafficking (the present TIC charges). Each of these present TIC charges carried mandatory minimum sentences of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. Shafie’s involvement in the OCG and its trafficking enterprise spanned the period from sometime in March 2019 to 16 July 2019. As stated in \[2\] above, Shafie had the audacity of committing these serious drug offences whilst on Bail and during the period he was facing trial for the cheating charges. This was particularly aggravating.

20     All considered, the Prosecution’s primary submission of an imprisonment sentence of eight years for the proceeded trafficking charge was clearly appropriate. The operation of the OCA within the context of the proceeded trafficking charge meant that an “uplift” for the imprisonment sentence component had to be considered. The effect of the OCA was that the maximum imprisonment sentence for the proceeded trafficking charge was enhanced by an additional five years. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that, taking into account the activities of the OCG and Shafie’s degree of involvement, an uplift of 12 months’ imprisonment would have been appropriate. The Prosecution further moderated their submission for the 12 months’ uplift to an uplift of six months’ imprisonment, after taking into account that Shafie was already serving sentence for the cheating charges, and that the sentence for the consumption charge was to run consecutively. In my view, this concession on the part of the Prosecution (to peg the uplift component for the proceeded trafficking charge at only six months) was reasonable in the circumstances. I agreed with the Prosecution’s approach on this point and this is reflected in the total sentence meted out to Shafie.

21     The Defence had agreed with the Prosecution’s submission for the “imprisonment terms sought for each of the respective offences”. The Defence urged the Court to accept this agreement by the Defence as an “indicative starting point” for the totality of the sentence. I had carefully considered the mitigating factors put forward by the Defence. In the final assessment, the Prosecution’s submission on sentence was appropriate, and Shafie was sentenced as set out in \[7\].

22     The Defence recognised that the cheating charges related to “the violation of a separate distinct legal interest as compared to” the drug offences considered herein. The Defence submitted that Shafie was “still prejudiced as the … sentence of 48 months (for the cheating charges) had been passed without due consideration from a global perspective; especially the lengthy drug trafficking sentencing term”. The Defence further submitted that “if (Shafie) were to be sentenced together with his Section 420 Charges; only one of the Section 420 Charges would likely have been ordered to run consecutively instead of the three”.

23     The Defence thus submitted for an imprisonment sentence of six years and six months, together with an uplift of six months, to give seven years’ imprisonment for the proceeded trafficking charge. When added to the consecutive sentence for the consumption charge, the total imprisonment sentence urged by the Defence was eight years (the Defence agreed with the Prosecution’s submission in relation to the caning component and the fine component of the total sentence). The difference of the submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence for the imprisonment portion of the total sentence amounted to one year and six months’ imprisonment.

24     In my view, the Prosecution’s concession of a reduction of six months’ imprisonment (from the uplift component for the proceeded trafficking charge) was reasonable and appropriate in all the circumstances of the case: this would sufficiently take into account any “prejudice” Shafie may have suffered as a result of having been sentenced on two occasions. To be clear, I am of the view that Shafie had not suffered any prejudice.

25     I could not agree with the submission of the Defence on the issue of the totality of the sentence to be meted out. It was pure speculation that had all the charges (cheating and drug) been considered together, that only one of the sentences for the cheating charges would have been made to run consecutively, instead of three. The Defence’s submission that Shafie had been “prejudiced” could not be supported at all. The drug charges probably could not have been prosecuted at the same time as the cheating charges were (as the drug offences had been committed a very short time before the cheating charges were dealt with). What was conclusive towards the total rejection of the Defence’s submission in the present case, was that this situation was one entirely of Shafie’s own making. He had chosen to commit these very serious drug offences whilst he was on Bail and whilst the cheating charges were pending. He had chosen to commit offences for which very heavy mandatory minimum sentences would apply. He had chosen to commit offences that had the great potential of visiting upon hapless victims the immense suffering wrought by drug addiction.

26     This was not a situation where all the charges could have been considered together, having regard to the timing of Shafie’s decision to take a certain course of action for the cheating charges and the timing of his commission of the drug offences.

27     To be clear, I totally agreed with the Prosecution’s very carefully calibrated submission on sentence. I agreed with the Prosecution’s approach for the appropriate “discount” to be applied in the present situation where Shafie was already serving a substantial sentence imposed earlier. I sentenced Shafie as stated in \[7\], and ordered that the imprisonment sentences for the drug charges were to take effect from the expiry of the imprisonment term being served for the cheating charges.

28     I understand that Shafie is currently serving sentence for the cheating charges. Shafie appealed against the sentences for the drug charges.
