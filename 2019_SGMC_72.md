\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9173/2019/01.\]

17 November 2019

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused was a primary school teacher at the United World College of South East Asia-Dover Campus (‘UWCSEA’). He claimed trial to a charge of outraging the modesty of the wife of a colleague at the staff end-of-the-year gathering held at the Singapore Cricket Club (‘SCC’). He was acquitted after a four-day trial. The Public Prosecutor has brought this appeal against the acquittal. The charge reads:

> are charged that you, on 17 June 2017, at or about 12.00 a.m., at Singapore Cricket Club located at Connaught Drive, Singapore, did use criminal force on one XXX, Female/ 53 years old, to wit, by running your hand down the small of her back to her waist and to her right buttock cheek, knowing it to be likely that you will outrage the modesty of the said XXX, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).

## The Prosecution’s Case

2       The prosecution called three witnesses. Their evidence is summarised below.

#### Evidence of PW1 − the complainant

3       The complainant was 51 years of age at the time of the alleged incident.

4       On 16 June 2017 at about 8.30pm, the complainant and her husband (who shall be referred to as ‘G’) arrived at the SCC. They proceeded up to the reception area in front of the function room. There was a bar counter at the end of the reception area. They took a glass of wine each. The complainant took one or two sips of the white wine. She disliked the taste. She then tried the red wine and also disliked its taste. G then got a spritzer (white wine with soda or sparkling water) for her from the bartender.

5       The complainant claimed that she only had spritzers for the rest of the evening. Asked how many glasses of spritzers she drank, she replied that she did not count. She added that she barely finished each glass because it would be removed after she placed it on the cocktail tables when she went to dance.

6       The complainant and G initially mingled with the crowd and their social group at the reception area. At around 9pm, they went into the function room where the buffet was. The entrance and exit into the function room is via two arches at the right and left (numbered 1 and 3 respectively in the sketch plan P28). The complainant testified that the floor space in the function room was very tight. There was one row of sitting tables on both sides and cocktail tables nearer to the arches. The complainant and G had their dinner and chatted. There were also speeches delivered in the function room.

7       At around 10pm, the complainant and G went to the adjoining room (known as the Gilmour Room) where a live band was playing. They spent their time listening to the music, chatting and dancing.

8       At about midnight, the band stopped playing. According to the complainant, G knew the band members and one of them was a good friend. G went to thank the band whilst she chatted at the cocktail tables. After G returned, they left the Gilmour Room and proceeded into the function room to leave for home.

9       G was on her left whilst they were walking. She had her left arm in his right arm at the elbow. They proceeded towards the middle of the function room in the direction of the right (1st) archway, which is closest to the staircase. Whilst they were walking, G made ‘small talk’ with the people who were on his left. However, they did not stop at any point. It was the complainant’s evidence that it was not crowded on her right and there was no one beside her.

10     Around the middle of the room, she felt a hand on her back, which moved to the small of her back, down to above the right buttock and across to the hip, to the right side of her buttock and finally cupped her buttock cheek at the bottom. She marked the area where the incident occurred with a circle in the sketch plan P28A. She initially thought that it was her friend who was touching her when the hand was on her back. She was shocked when the hand moved to her hip and felt that it was wrong when the hand cupped her buttock. She illustrated how the hand moved down her body to her buttock in diagram P29A.

11     After the four to six seconds of contact, she stopped walking. She moved her right hand behind to remove the hand. In the process, she grabbed the wrist of the hand that was still on her buttock. Thereafter, she turned and saw the accused. She asked the accused, “Are you a member of UWC?” The accused did not reply. Next, she asked, “Are you a guest to this party or are you a teacher at UWC?” The accused again did not reply. She then asked, “Do you teach here?” The accused then responded, “Yes, I am a primary school teacher.” She then asked “Why are you touching me? Why have I got your hand on my buttock?” The accused then said, “Get real! I’m gay.”, and flicked his hand out aggressively from her wrist and walked off.

12     She testified that she turned to G after the accused left. She told him what exactly the accused did. She claimed that G saw her grabbing the accused’s hand.

13     Thereafter, she was approached by someone who introduced himself as Jo McWilliams (‘Jo’). He told her that he was a teacher at UWC. The complainant asked Jo if the accused was gay. Jo confirmed that he is. She said that Jo insisted that it was a misunderstanding as the accused was a nice man, and being a gay he would not touch a woman.

14     Nicola Hambelton (‘Nicola’) and Richard Hambelton (‘Richard’) who were her friends then approached her and Jo. Nicola said that she knew the accused and he was a ‘really lovely lad’. Nicola remarked that it could not have happened and said she will go and talk to the accused. Nicola went to speak to the accused. When Nicola returned, she told the complainant that the accused had said that he would not apologise as he did not do it.

15     The complainant gave evidence that Nicola began to doubt her and asked “Could it be a mistaken identity?” The complainant rebutted by saying she had caught hold of the accused’s wrist. Nicola then asked if she had caught the wrong hand. The complainant then proceeded to demonstrate on Nicola’s body how she was touched.

16     The complainant said that Jo kept insisting that the accused is a good person and he would not have done it as he is gay. He also told her that the accused had been drinking. At one stage, Jo started to cry. The complainant tried to demonstrate on Jo how she was touched. However, he declined.

17     The complainant testified that G also went to speak to the accused. When he returned, he informed her that he had told the accused that it did not matter whether it was intentional or accidental and that only an acknowledgment that he had touched and an apology was required. However, the accused was insistent that he did not touch and refused to apologise.

18     On 18 June 2017, the accused emailed G. He suggested a meeting to resolve matters to avoid any ill-feeling. Eventually a meeting was arranged to take place on 20 June 2017 with the school counsellor, Ian Andrew Moody (‘Mr Moody’), acting as a mediator. The complainant attended with G and the accused attended with his colleague, Claire O’Farrell (‘Claire’). The accused did not admit to touching the complainant during the meeting. His position was that “If I have touched you, I apologise.”

19     The school was closed for eight weeks from 23 June 2017. When the new semester started in late August 2017, G brought the matter up to the school’s management. However, no action was taken by the school ‘to formally record the incident’.

20     On 25 November 2017, the complainant lodged a police report against the accused. She explained the five month delay in making the police report on the ground that she only wanted an acknowledgment that the accused had touched her and an apology but it was not forthcoming. In addition, she said she “had trusted the school to do the right thing and they didn’t”.

#### Evidence of PW2 – G

21     G is the husband of the complainant. He is a secondary school teacher at UWCSEA - Dover Campus.

22     On 16 June 2017 at about 8.30pm, he arrived at the SCC together with the complainant. They took the staircase up to the second floor where the reception was held. He and the complainant were at the reception area for a short while. The complainant first took a glass of red wine. She took a sip of it and did not like the taste. She then tried two to three sips of the white vine and asked for it to be diluted with fizzy water. He got her a spritzer from the bar at the reception area.

23     Thereafter, they proceeded to the function room where the speeches were given and the buffet was set up. G recalled that the buffet tables were at the far end of the room (indicated as ‘buffet’ in P28A by G). He stated that there were standing tables near to the entrance/exit of the room. There was also a line of tables with chairs in front of the trophy cabinets on both sides of the room. He indicated where the tables with chairs were by circles in the sketch plan P28A and the five standing tables as ‘standing tables area’.

24     G and the complainant had their dinner in the function room. After the speeches ended, he went with the complainant to the Gilmour Room to watch the band and dance. He said he probably got four or five glasses of beer for himself and four or five glasses of spritzers for the complainant from the small bar within the Gilmour Room. The spritzers were one-quarter of white wine with sparkling water. He said the complainant did not finish the four or five glasses because on three occasions her glasses were removed from the cocktail tables when they went to dance.

25     After the band stopped playing, G went to speak to the band members. One of them was Martin Andrew Lyon (‘Martin’). It was his evidence that he and the complainant ‘hugely’ enjoyed the band. He testified that they were very happy when they came out from the Gilmour Room and entered the function room. He exchanged brief pleasantries with the people who were near the trophy cabinet at the left of the room. G stated that the function room had ‘emptied considerably’ and there were small groups of people who were finishing off their conversations.

26     He gave evidence that there was no one around as he and the complainant walked diagonally in the middle of the room. He said the complainant was walking on his right and she was very close to him – almost touching. He testified that roughly in the middle of the room, the complainant stopped and turned suddenly. He also stopped and turned. He saw the complainant holding the accused’s left wrist in her right hand at above waist height. He did not know who the accused was at that stage and had also not noticed him at the event prior to that. He agreed that he did not see any contact with the complainant by the accused.

27     He said the complainant asked the accused if he was a staff member or a guest. The accused did not respond. She then asked him “Are you a member of staff?” The accused again did not reply. She next asked a question to the effect why he had his hand on her. The accused then replied that he was a grade 5 teacher. The complainant then asked why she caught his hand and why was he touching her. The accused aggressively freed his hand and said ‘Get real! I’m gay”. The accused then walked off.

28     G asked the complainant what had happened. She told him that the accused had moved his hand down the back of her body to her hip and across and rested it under her buttock. He said that the complainant was very upset and angry and he too was upset and very angry. G recollected that Richard, Nicola and Jo arrived more or less at the same time but added that he was not sure. He said that Nicola or Jo suggested that the complainant may be mistaken as to the identity of the perpetrator. He said that upset the complainant tremendously. Nicola then asked if she could speak to the accused and if the matter could be settled with an apology. The complainant agreed.

29     He related that Nicola walked to the right hand side of the room. About two to three minutes later, she returned. She said that the accused had denied doing it and he therefore would not apologise. He said that Jo was insistent that the accused was the wrong person identified as he would not do such an act. G then decided to go and speak to the accused to find out if there was a way of resolving it. He told the accused that it did not matter whether it was accidental or deliberate and the situation could be resolved with an apology. The accused told G that he will not apologise as he did not do it.

30     G then returned to where the complainant was. He said that Jo and Nicola expressed the possibility that the complainant could have identified the accused wrongly. However, he said the complainant explained that she caught his hand and demonstrated how specifically the incident happened. He said Jo was quite distraught that the complainant had made a wrong identification and sobbed for a few minutes.

31     On 18 June 2017, he received an email from the accused. He did not expect to receive an email as they did not know each other in UWCSEA. G said that the school was informed of the incident and he and the complainant wanted a resolution without involving the authorities. To that end, a mediation session was conducted in the presence of the school counsellor, Mr Moody. However, the mediation was unsuccessful as the accused maintained that he did not touch the complainant.

32     When school reopened in August 2017 after the summer break, G informed the deputy head of the school, Sue Bradshaw (‘Sue’), about the incident. He said that he wanted Sue to be aware of the complainant’s ongoing psychological issues connected to the incident. He had a series of meetings with Sue in August and September 2017. She told him that she would find out more information about what had happened. He said that when the investigation by Sue came to an end, he and the complainant were invited to attend a meeting in the presence of Mr Moody. He said that Sue informed them that she would not be making a formal record of the incident as she did not feel the accused had a case to answer. He said that she turned down their request to have a formal inquiry.

33     Asked why a police report was not lodged immediately, G said that he felt that it was possible to resolve it. He also added that he did not know the ‘statutes and laws… which are connected to such an offence’.

#### PW3 – Station Inspector Jansen Lee (‘SI Lee’)

34     SI Lee is the investigation officer of the case. He testified that there was no CCTV footage available as there was a delay of five months in the reporting.

## Prima facie case

35     At the close of the prosecution’s case, there was no submission of ‘no case’ made. The two courses were explained to the accused and he elected to give evidence. He called seven witnesses in his defence.

## Defence case

#### Evidence of DW1 – Accused

36     The accused had been employed as a primary school teacher at UWCSEA- Dover Campus since 2013.

37     He arrived at the SCC at 8.15pm. He had dinner and a glass of white wine before that. He estimated that over 200 people attended the event. He estimated the width of the function room to be about 10 metres.

38     He spent the majority of his time with friends at a table between the 1st archway and the trophy cabinet. Between 12.15 to 12.30am, he decided to go to the toilet. From within the room, he proceeded to the second archway at the extreme right. He stated that there were cocktail tables placed in the vicinity of the archways. He indicated the cocktail tables with three circles in the sketch plan P28B. He stated that the band which was playing in the Gilmour Room had finished playing at midnight, and people were making their way out through the right archway closest to the toilets. He emphasised that it was ‘particularly crowded’ around the right archway. He estimated about 30 people were congregating in the area.

39     He squeezed through the people to make his way to the toilet. He took the same route back. He moved through the crowd by leading with his shoulder. When he was at the area which he marked with an ‘X’ in P28B, someone grabbed his right wrist. He turned around and was surprised to see the complainant whom he did not know. She said, “You grabbed my ass”. He was shocked and replied “What?” as he pulled his wrist away. She repeated “You just grabbed my ass.” He then replied, “Look, I’m gay. I wouldn’t have done that.” It was the accused’s position that he was unaware of any contact with the complainant, and if there was, it would have been accidental as he made his way through the crowd.

40     He went back to his table. He spoke to his colleague, Natalie Jayne Bane (‘Natalie’). He told her of the accusation. As Natalie was aware that he is gay, she just shook her head and dismissed the accusation as absurd. He sat down and looked across in the direction of the right archway. He saw the complainant talking animatedly and pointing in his direction. Later, his colleague, Nicola, came over and suggested to him to go and speak to the complainant. As he was walking towards the complainant, G came towards him. They spoke in front of the golden arch (Arch 2 in P28B). G told him that he should just apologise. He told G that he could not apologise for something that he did not do.

41     The accused returned to his table. Later, another colleague, Jo, approached and asked what was wrong. He told him of the accusation. Jo asked if he should go over and find out what was happening. The accused agreed. Thereafter, the accused went out of the room to the staircase. He was there with Natalie.

42     About 10 minutes later, Nicola and her husband, came down. Nicola told him that the complainant was repeating herself and could not be reasoned with. She suggested to him to leave. At 1.15am, he boarded a taxi and left.

43     On the following day (18th June), he contacted Nicola and asked for the email addresses of the complainant and G. He said that as G was a colleague, it was doubtless that they would see each other. Hence, he decided to email him to clear the misunderstanding.

44     He sent email 1 in D1 to G. He suggested a face-to-face meeting, if they wished. Eventually, a meeting was arranged with the school counsellor, Mr Moody, acting as a moderator. The meeting took place on 20 June 2017 in Mr Moody’s office. The complainant brought G along for moral support. The accused brought along his colleague, Claire.

45     He testified that the complainant read from a prepared script. He said that she was particularly upset that nobody believed her. She accused him of sliding his hand down her back to her buttock. He said that was the first time he heard the allegation that he slid his hand, as on the night of the alleged incident, she had just accused him of grabbing her buttock. She also told him that he ought to have apologised to prevent the situation from escalating. She accused him of rallying his friends to ‘attack’ her and claimed that a blonde woman had shown the middle finger to her. He said that the complainant made three demands. First, that he apologise for the alleged physical contact. Second, that he apologise for failing to apologise on the day of the incident and for rallying his friends against her. Third, that he refrain from talking about the incident.

46     The accused said that the allegation that he had rallied his friends made no sense to him as he had only informed two of his friends about the incident. The two friends were Natalie who has dark hair and Jo. He decided against pointing out that her allegation had changed from grabbing the buttock to sliding the hand down the back to the buttock. He also decided not to rebut that he had rallied his friends as the complainant was very upset and he did not wish to aggravate her further. Accordingly, he gave an apology for ‘any physical contact made’ as he was passing through the crowd. He also apologised for not having apologised on the day of the incident and for her account of the alleged reaction of his friends.

47     The accused was asked to put his apology in writing. On the same day, he wrote email 5 in D1. The e-mail reads:

> Thank you for taking the time to meet this afternoon, and thank you for explaining your feelings on the matter. I am sincerely sorry that you have been hurt and upset by this incident.

> Firstly, I would like to apologise for any physical contact that I made with XXX on Friday night. While I believe that this contact was accidental, I am sorry to have invaded XXX’s personal space, and for how this has made her feel.

> I would also like to apologise for how I reacted at the time. I should have said sorry to XXX for making physical contact with her, rather than being shocked and flippant when she told me that I had. I appreciate that, since I did not apologise at the time, the situation escalated and made XXX feel worse.

> As you have requested, I have contacted my friends this afternoon, and I have told them that I should have apologised to XXX that evening, as G asked me to, in order to stop the situation from escalating as it did.

> In addition, I have also asked people not to discuss the issue, so that we can move on and nobody is made to feel worse than they already do, and so that we can have positive interactions in the future.

> Thank you again for taking the time to meet with me this afternoon. As XXX said, none of us want to move around Dover Campus with people giving us looks like ‘daggers’.

> I am glad that we are all keen to put Friday night behind us, and to move on without any ill-feeling between us or our colleagues.

48     The accused received the following reply from G (email 6 in D1):

> I believe that it will help to address the issues raised in the meeting yesterday.

> You did at the end of the meeting apologise, as XXX had asked, for the 3 issues that she had raised about what happened after the incident itself. These are not full reflected in the email unfortunately.

> Could I ask that to fully address these points in the email, that you add that you did apologise in the meeting on behalf of your friends and their actions towards XXX.

> You have already mentioned in the email that you have spoken to your friends. Could your email reflect that in doing so you have pointed out that their responses were inappropriate not only to XXX but also in their capacity as teachers at UWSCEA, as you said you would yesterday when it was discussed.

> I strongly believe that this would help in bringing this matter to a close as we all hope.

49     Based on the email, the accused thought that the outstanding issues were that he had not apologised on behalf of his friends and he was also asked to comment on their capacity as teachers at the school. The accused stated that he was not aware of who the complainant was referring to. As he was not in a position to comment on whether they were teachers of the school, he sent the following reply (email 7 in D1):

> In addition to the e-mail that I sent yesterday evening, I would like to make a further apology, so as to fully address the points raised in our meeting on Tuesday.

> As discussed, I would like to apologise on behalf of my friends and their actions towards XXX.

> In order to ensure that this issue is resolved and no longer a topic of conversation, I have made it quite clear to my friends that I should have apologised when the incident arose, and that the actions of my friends and myself were inappropriate. Again, I apologise for the response of my friends and I.

> I would like to thank you again for meeting with me yesterday. I hope that I have fully addressed the points raised on Tuesday, and that this will bring this matter to a close as we all hope. I believe that we can enjoy our future as colleagues at UWCSEA, with no ill-feeling between any of us.

In response, G replied as follows:

> Thank you for your email Ben.

> I will pass this email on to my wife.

50     The accused stated that nothing happened over the next two months, which was the summer break. At the end of August 2017, the Deputy Head of the school, Susan Bradshaw, spoke to him. She informed him that the complainant was still very upset and felt that his apology was not sincere. She also told him that the complainant wanted to know the identity of the blonde woman who had stuck her middle finger at her. He replied that he did not know who the complainant was referring to.

51     On 28 November 2017, he received a call from SI Lee who informed him that the complainant had lodged a police report.

52     Under cross-examination, the accused said that he was snacking on the buffet food and drinking between 8.30pm and 11.30pm. He estimated that he had four or five glasses of beer. He was not sure when the bar at the reception area outside the function room closed. He estimated that it was between 11.30 to 11.45pm. He was sure that the bar had stopped serving before the band stopped playing at midnight.

53     At about midnight when the band stopped playing, people started coming out of the Gilmour Room. He stated that most people from the Gilmour Room were walking in front of the tables on the left hand-side (as one is coming out of the Gilmour Room) of the function room where there were people seated. He observed that the people were stopping to have brief conversations and some were finishing their drinks and saying goodbyes. He said the area where the three cocktail tables were placed and the area around the right archway, which was closest to the toilets, were where most of the people were congregating. He agreed that the area on the right of the function room was less crowded and the area at the centre of the function room was empty. He said that the majority of the people at the cocktail tables were not moving but the people around the right archway were stopping and moving.

54     The accused did not watch the band playing. He said he was in the main function room. Towards the end of the evening from around 10.30 or 11pm, he was speaking to Philip Jury and Anisha Welmink at the table nearest to the first archway. At about 12.15 to 12.30am, Anisha Welmink left for home. He said there were about 10 people near his table. He was only able to remember Philip Jury, Natalie and Kevin Hall were at his table. The accused then decided to go to the toilet.

55     He walked through the crowd at the standing tables and made his way to the right archway. He said it was busier around the right archway compared to the standing tables and he had to squeeze past the people who were standing and moving there. Asked why he did not go out through the left archway and through the reception area, he said the reception area was not empty, and he had simply got up and took the most direct route. He stated that whilst he had to make his way through the crowd, he could move pass the people. He said that there were also other people moving pass one another. Asked about his pace of walking, he said that he slowed down “a bit” and he had to stop at times when someone had stepped in front of him.

56     On his way back from the toilet, he took the same route. He said that he was leading with his left shoulder and his right hand was trailing behind at waist level. He said the complainant was on his right when he turned after she grabbed his right wrist. He disagreed that the complainant held his left wrist in the middle of the room at the circle drawn in P28A. He drew the place in P28B and marked it with an X in a circle. He said that after she grabbed his right wrist and spoke to him, he returned to his seat. He could see the complainant from where he was. He said that she was then close to the right-hand side of archway 3.

#### Evidence of DW2 – Martin Andrew Lyon (‘Martin’)

57     Martin is a teacher at UWCSEA. Martin had known G for 18 years. He said they were quite close friends but their friendship drifted after G married the complainant. He did not know the accused.

58     On 16 June 2017, Martin was the singer and the keyboard player in the band that was providing the entertainment in the Gilmour Room. They started playing at about 9.30pm. They were expected to stop at around 11am but continued until close to midnight as everyone was enjoying themselves. He was unable to estimate the number of people in the room but said that it was still very busy when they stopped.

59     After the band stopped, the complainant approached him. He said she was effusive, energised and probably euphoric. He said she stood too close to him and grabbed his arm and repeated again and again that it was good and she had a great time. She also asked him to play at an event. Martin was unable to recall what event she had mentioned. He estimated his interaction with the complainant to have taken between 30 to 40 seconds. Martin was left with the impression that the complainant was quite drunk.

60     About 15 minutes later, after packing his equipment, Martin went out to the function room. He walked diagonally across the room to take the 1st archway out to the staircase. When he was in the middle of the room, he saw G trying to pacify the complainant who looked upset. He said they were just outside the 3rd archway. He also saw a crowd of people in that area.

61     Under cross-examination, he agreed that the middle of the room was relatively empty when he left. Asked if he was assuming the complainant was drunk, he answered: _“…I am, but the evidence that I saw or kind of point to that way; the repeating the same thing again and again. And---the---the general overly positive nature of what was being said, standing too close. She stood way too close to me for a normal conversation.”_

#### Evidence of DW3 – Brian Sean Johnson (‘Brian’)

62     Brian is a teacher at UWCSEA. He knew the complainant, G and the accused prior to the incident.

63     He arrived at the event at about 8.30pm. His partner, Michelle, had arrived earlier. They had food and chatted with friends in the function room. Between 9.30pm to 10pm, they moved to the Gilmour Room where the band had started playing.

64     Whilst watching the band, he felt a tap on his shoulder from behind. He turned around and saw it was the complainant. She asked him if he would introduce Michele. He observed that she had a glass of red wine in her hand. They chatted for a short while. After which, he turned to watch the band again.

65     Later, whilst they were standing and watching the band, the complainant bumped into the back of Michelle and in the process tipped the glass of red wine on Michelle’s black dress. Brian’s evidence was that the room was not crowded at this stage and there was space amongst them. He said that he did not think that anyone had knocked into the complainant.

66     Subsequently, whilst he was dancing, the complainant hit onto his right shoulder. He turned and caught her from falling. He said they simply laughed it off.

67     Brian surmised that the complainant was drunk as he did not believe that anyone had knocked into her during the two incidents.

68     Around 11.00pm, Brian and Michelle went to the veranda of the room. He said that he did return to the room to dance from time to time. However, he did not notice the complainant again.

#### Evidence of DW4 – Natalie Jayne Bane (‘Natalie’)

69     Natalie is a high school English teacher at UWCSEA. She came to know the accused as a colleague when she started teaching at UWCSEA in 2014. Since then they have become friends. She said that she knows the accused’s character and that he is gay.

70     On the 16th of June 2017, she attended the end of term staff party at the SCC. She arrived between 8.45 to 9.00pm. She spent the majority of the time at the balcony outside the Gilmour Room. At around 11.00 to 11.15pm, she went into the function room where her partner, Philip Jury, was sitting with the accused and another colleague, Anisha Welmink. She joined them at the first table near the 1st archway. Shortly, they were joined by another colleague, Kevin Hall, who sat next to Natalie.

71     Shortly before midnight, another colleague, Sarah Denby, came over to inform them that the bar was about to close. Natalie decided to go to the bathroom and to collect some drinks for herself and two friends. She made her way diagonally across to the 3rd archway. She testified that the band had recently finished playing and everyone was making their way from the Gilmour Room through the 3rd archway to the bar and the bathrooms. She said that there was quite a bottleneck on both sides of the 3rd archway. She bumped into quite a few people and placed her hands on the backs of people to squeeze past. She also recalled having to duck under the arms of some people who were gesticulating with their hands.

72     After going to the bathroom, she managed to get three glasses of wine although the staff was putting the wine bottles away as the bar was closing. As she was carrying three glasses of wine, she decided to take a different route. She walked outside the function room and entered through the 1st archway. However, she said that it did not make a huge difference as the reception area outside the 3rd archway was also very crowded.

73     When she returned, she spoke to her friends at the area close to the air conditioning unit near to the 1st archway (see photograph P14). Thereafter, she sat at the table. Later, the accused came up to her and said, “That woman over there has just accused me of grabbing her ass.” He looked towards the 3rd archway when he said that. She noticed that the accused looked quite shocked. Natalie was unable to make out who the accused was referring to because the area was crowded. Natalie dismissed the allegation as ridiculous.

74     About 30 minutes later, she noticed Jo going over to speak to a group of people. She then realised that things had escalated and it was more serious than she had first thought.

75     Under cross-examination, asked if she saw the accused during the course of the evening, she said that she did bump into him a couple of times. She knew that he was speaking to Philip Jury in the function room. She went to speak to them once or twice but was not interested in their conversation and went back to join her friends at the balcony.

76     She estimated that there were probably around 35 people at the area just before the 3rdarchway. She said the crowd was both moving and static. She said that there were two high tables around the area of the 3rd archway and there were groups of people who were congregating around there. She said there were also a few people moving through to the bar or to the bathrooms. In comparison, she said that there were more people congregating at the area in front of the bar counter. She was asked by the learned DPP[^1]:

| 

Q:

 | 

In fact, Ms. Bane, would you agree with me that if there were that many people in---at or around the left archway, you would have exited the right archway and proceeded to the toilet through the reception area as opposed to having to squeeze through the left archway simply because you could see from where you were as you were making your way to the toilet the condition as to how jammed or how choked the left archway was.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Um, the route through that left archway, Your Honour, was the most direct route to the bathroom, um, particularly from where we were sitting which was the far end of the table, um, at the opposite end to where the right archway was, um, had I been seated at the other end of the table, perhaps, I would’ve gone the other way, but from that far end away from the arch, walking diagonally across to the left archway was the most direct route, um, and I felt that it was crowded. And but the---the bottleneck that forms around the bar and the bathrooms on the opposite side of the archway would mean that I was squeezing through people whichever route I took. It wouldn’t have avoided, um, that issue or that crowds completely had I gone in the other ---in the other direction.

 |
| 

….

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Right. And in front of the left---left archway, directly in front of left archway on the main hall side, is it your evidence also that that area was crowded?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Both. Inside of the main room and on the other side of the archway in front of the bar area because of the position of the bar being next to the toilet and people trying to get around to the bathrooms would also collecting those final drinks of the evening. Both sides of that area were particularly crowded at this point in time.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And despite the fact that you saw that both sides were crowded, you decided let’s just go through that left archway when you actually had the right archway which was not crowded for you to go through, right?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, as I’ve said that was the most direct route from where we were sitting, um, was to go through that area, um, I imagine as or because of the---the golden archway in the middle, I could see that the crowd on the other side of that---that golden archway by the bar, I could see that. I knew that that was crowded as well. So I felt that taking the direct route would be the easiest regardless of the crowd, as the crowd seems to be on both sides of that archway. So, I would’ve hit it whichever direction I took.

#### Evidence of DW5 – Richard John Hambleton (‘Richard’)

77     Richard is a teacher at UWCSEA. He has known the complainant and G since August 2010. He did not know the accused. He only met the accused on the day of the alleged incident at the SCC.

78     Sometime between 12.15 and 12.30am, he and his wife, Nicola, left the Gilmour Room. When they were halfway at the left side of the function room, he noticed a commotion directly ahead near the left (3rd) archway. He noticed that somebody was very upset. As he approached the archway, he realised that it was the complainant. He and Nicola decided to help as they were friends of the complainant and G.

79     He stated the complainant was quite hysterical. She was screaming a lot of slightly incoherent words. He said the complainant was very upset that somebody had grabbed her ‘ass’. He was not certain if the complainant used the word ‘grabbed’ but he was certain that she said ‘ass’. She was gesticulating with her hand and running it in the shape of somebody’s back and buttock to show how she had been touched. Nicola tried to calm her down but she did not listen. He said that she demonstrated repeatedly on Nicola how she was touched.

80     He testified that the complainant used her right hand to swipe around in the direction of the staircase and said “Look at them, they are taking a piss. They are giving me the finger.” The complainant held his arm when she did the sweeping motion about six times. He noticed that she was not very stable on her feet and very agitated. He was not able to see anyone who was antagonising the complainant. As a result, he formed the opinion that the complainant was drunk. He explained his basis as follows[^2]:

> She appeared drunk, she, uh---uh, you know, her eyes lacked some focus, she certainly wasn’t fully capable on her feet. She was a little bit wobbly when she was doing the sweeping motion. And it was a---that repetitive nature of somebody who find it really hard to listen to what might be a reasonable explanation that my wife was trying to give to her that actually just made her more and more angry, more and more hysterical. She---she was just having problems listening to anybody talking to her. I would say some of the things I described there would describe the previous occasions that I have observed XXX in a---in a drunk scenario and there have been a few.

81     Thereafter, he spoke to a colleague about school related matters. Later, he saw Jo had joined Nicola to talk to the complainant. Subsequently, he and Nicola decided to leave. They saw the accused downstairs. They hailed a taxi for him.

82     Under cross-examination, asked why he did not take the 1st archway, he said it was a less obvious way to go out. He said the left hand side of the function room was clear until half way down. Thereafter, he said that one would have to negotiate carefully by being polite and squeezing through the gaps of the people who were congregating.

#### Evidence of DW6 – Nicola Hambelton (‘Nicola’)

83     Nicola is the head of high school Art at UWCSEA. She has known the complainant and G since 2010. She described the complainant to be a good friend. She only knew the accused as a colleague.

84     Nicola arrived with Richard between 8.30 to 9pm. After having food whilst listening to speeches and talking to some friends, Nicola went into the Gilmour Room between 9.45 to 10pm.

85     Around midnight, the band stopped playing. She had an enjoyable evening. She continued talking to her friends in the Gilmour Room. Her husband, Richard, then came to the room. He joined in the chat. Thereafter, they left the room and went into the main function room. They proceeded to the 3rd archway on the left.

86     From a distance, Nicola noticed a commotion near the archway. She heard someone shouting and making quite a lot of noise. As she got closer, she saw the complainant gesticulating with her arms and saw she had tears falling down her face. She said the complainant was looking towards the right side of the room. She decided to approach the complainant to see if she could help.

87     She asked the complainant what had happened. The complainant told her that somebody had touched her. The complainant proceeded to use her palm to demonstrate by rubbing it down and up on the right side of Nicola’s body from below the underarm to around the hip. Nicola asked her who had done the act. Nicola’s recollection was that G stated that it was the accused. The complainant also told her that the accused had replied, “Get real, I’m gay.” when she grabbed his hand.

88     Nicola told the complainant and G that she knows the accused and that he is a really nice guy. She went to speak to the accused. She met the accused near the middle arch. She told him to just apologise because she was hoping that by apologising, it would make everything okay. The accused told her that he was unable to apologise because he did not do anything.

89     She went back to the complainant and told her that the accused said that he did not do anything to her. Nicola asked her if it could have been a mistake or an accident when he walked past. She said that this appeared to anger the complainant quite a lot more. The complainant then grabbed hold of Nicola’s right hand and gripped it at the wrist and did the same up down rubbing movement with the palm on the side of the body. She did this repeatedly for about four to five times. The complainant also kept repeating that she had grabbed the accused’s hand and what was his hand doing there. Nicola said it was very difficult to calm the complainant down. Richard tried to calm the complainant down by saying that she did not do anything wrong. The complainant was a little calmer momentarily when he said that. However, she said the complainant still did not listen to anyone’s assistance in helping her.

90     Later, Jo arrived and the conversation continued for some time. Nicola said that they could not calm the complainant down. Nicola found the complainant to be quite aggressive and decided to leave.

91     As they were walking down the staircase with Richard, they noticed the accused was queuing up for a taxi. Nicola and Richard were fearful for the accused’s safety. They went across the road and flagged a taxi so that the accused could leave in it.

92     Under cross-examination, she said that there were not many people in the centre of the function room when she saw the complainant. She said most people were further down from the centre and closer to the archways. She said there were people beyond and around the complainant but she was unable to remember how crowded it was.

#### Evidence of DW7 – Joseph Matthew McWilliams (‘Jo’)

93     Jo is a teacher at UWCSEA since 2013. He came to know the accused in the same year. The accused is part of his friendship group and a close friend.

94     He arrived at about 8.30pm for the staff event. He spent most of the evening with his partner and colleagues at the balcony and in the Gilmour Room. He saw the accused two or three times briefly during the evening at the SCC. He did not see him at the Gilmour Room.

95     At around 1am, when he was going home, he bumped into the accused at the top of the left-hand staircase. He noticed that the accused appeared visibly upset and shocked. He asked him what had happened. The accused told him that he had been accused of grabbing someone’s ass and pointed to the complainant who was standing in front of the 3rd archway. Nicola and G were with her. He told the accused he would find out what happened and calm the situation. The accused then proceeded downstairs.

96     Jo saw from a distance that the complainant was upset and distraught. He approached her and introduced himself as a close friend of the accused. He enquired what had happened. The complainant alleged that the accused had grabbed her ass and was adamant that it was intentional. She proceeded to grab his arm to attempt to demonstrate on him what the accused allegedly did. He told her to stop as he found it uncomfortable.

97     He said the complainant grabbed the left wrist of Nicola with her right hand and demonstrated by a quick rapid downward motion along the side of her body a number of times continuously. He was unable to recall the number of times she did that. He said she attempted to grab Nicola’s ass but Nicola was affronted and asked her to stop.

98     He informed the complainant that he has known the accused for four years. He told her that he found it impossible to believe the accused could have done what was alleged as it was absolutely not in his nature to do anything like that with intent or malice to cause harm. He also commented about the accused’s sexuality and told her that he is gay. He tried to explore the possibilities of mistaken identity or unintentional contact between the two of them. However, the complainant simply repeated herself. He said the complainant was getting more and more exasperated that she was not believed and said, “This is like when a rape victim is not being believed”. Jo found the remark and the whole situation upsetting and ended up crying.

99     It was his evidence that he was with the complainant for five to 10 minutes. He said that she appeared drunk to him as she was slurring her words. He was able to understand her but said her words were not clear. He said she was extremely invasive of personal space, loud, aggressive and repeatedly said somebody has grabbed her ass and it is like when a rape victim has not been believed.

100    On the Monday following the incident, Jo approached G during break time at the school campus. He apologised and said that his intention had been to calm the situation and to try to find out exactly what had happened but it did not get anywhere. He enquired about the complainant and hoped that she was okay. G replied that they had a difficult weekend and the complainant was more upset about having not been believed.

#### Evidence of DW8 – Claire O’Farrell (‘Claire’)

101    Claire is a teacher at UWCSEA. She attended the event at the SCC on 16 June 2017. She had known the accused for about four years than and described him to be a close friend.

102    At about 12.10 or 12.15am, she came out from the Gilmour Room and wanted to leave the venue via the main function room. She noticed there were scatterings of people stopping and chatting in the room and the crowd was denser at the two archways. She decided to take an alternative route to avoid making her way through the crowd. Beside the main function room, there is a narrow corridor which leads to the restrooms. So she went that way, and came out just by the bar into the reception area in front of the left archway. She testified that she had to brush past people. She spoke for about 10 minutes to a friend at the reception area. She then made her way downstairs. She left at 12.48am in a private hire car.

103    On 17 June 2017 at 10.20am, she met the accused at a cafe. She noticed that he looked visibly upset. He told her that the night had ended in a terrible way, and that he had been accused of grabbing a colleague’s wife by the ass. Claire was very surprised by the allegation. She had found him to be a principled person and one who would never intentionally hurt somebody. She also knew him to be gay. She felt that it must have been a huge misunderstanding as the room was extremely crowded about the time when she was leaving which she believed was the time when the incident would have happened.

104    On 20 June 2017, she attended a meeting between the accused and the complainant in the presence of Mr Moody, the school counsellor. The complainant was with G and the accused had asked her to be present. The complainant began by reading from some sheets of paper. Claire said that she then learnt for the first time that the complainant was also alleging that the accused had slid his hand down her back.

105    The complainant said that she was really upset that the accused did not apologise on the night and she would have left it at that, if he had done so. She said that the fact that people had not believed her and had not sided with her was more upsetting to her than what she was saying the accused had done to her. The complainant also told the accused to tell his friends not to discuss the incident.

106    She said that the complainant commented that she was more sober than everybody else. She also alleged that the accused had riled up his friends against her and spoke about a blonde woman who had made an obscene gesture at her. The complainant said that she was very upset by this.

107    The accused told the complainant that he was very sorry that she was so upset. He told her that if there had been any touch, it could only have been accidental. He apologised for the fact that he did not apologise on the night and that it had caused her to be further upset.

108    She recalled that either Mr. Moody or G suggested that the accused should put in writing what he had said in the meeting. She said the accused clarified what had to be included in the written resolution. He was told that the matters to be included were an apology for making contact or touching the complainant, an apology for not apologising at the time, that he would ask his friends to apologise or apologise on their behalf, and also that the matter was to be no longer spoken about.

109    Under cross-examination, she gave the following evidence on why she decided not to go through the function room from the Gilmour Room[^3]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So when you say scatterings of people, that would mean that one could easily pass through between these scatterings of people. Would---would I be correct to say that?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Not really because if that was the case, I would have probably gone that way and because I would have just had to get past people at the archways, but the way the scatterings of people were dispersed, um, you would have to kind of weave in and out of people and so you wouldn’t have, uh, a straight line, um, to get to either archway. So, not only were the archways a deterrent but also and the fact that there’re lots and lots of people in the room. I couldn’t have just walked straight and I’m---I---yah, I wanted to---I didn’t want to, um---uh, delay at the event any further and I would have been chatting as there were so many people.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, when you say “weave through the people”, can I understand that to be shoulder to shoulder that you have less than 1 arm’s length away from the person you’re weaving through?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, yes---yes, um, so, at different points. So maybe exactly where I was standing, there would have been more room and probably, um, easily, um, a---a full arm or maybe---maybe even longer. Um, but as you would get closer in the room, it would get, um, m---m---less and less space, more and more narrow and to weave in past people.

 |

  
  

110    As regards the meeting with Mr Moody, she disagreed that the accused was asked to give a written apology for intentionally touching the complainant. She said the complainant implied that it could not have been accidental and her face did not look very pleased. However, the complainant said that they could ‘agree to disagree’.

## Rebuttal witness for the prosecution

111    The prosecution was allowed to call Mr Moody who was present during the meeting on 20 June 2017 to testify on what was said at the meeting.

#### Evidence of PW4 – Ian Andrew Moody (‘Mr Moody’)

112    Mr Moody was the head of counselling at UWCSEA - Dover Campus. On 20 June 2017, he was the mediator where the complainant, G, the accused and Claire were present.

113    Mr Moody took notes of the meeting. In respect of the complainant’s account of the incident, he took it verbatim from her script. She had written:

> You ran your hand down from the small of my back to my waist and lingered on my right buttock cheek. You rested your hand there for so long that I had the chance to grab your wrist, as your hand was still on me. It was very clear that this was not a case of accidental brushing, nor barging through. This was a deliberate act. In Singapore, this constitutes an outrage of modesty – its legal term as it is an offence in Singapore. When caught red-handed and confronted, your response was flippant and aggressive. You flipped my grip off your wrist and told me, ‘Get real! I’m gay’ and walked off dismissively.

114    He said the complainant emphasised the impact on her of the accused not have apologised at the time of the incident. He said she was upset that the accused had engaged his friends in support of his view that it was an accident. He said that he was not aware that the complainant had used the phrase ‘agree to disagree’.

115    He said the accused stated he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part but that the complainant seemed to have been affected by some kind of interaction. The accused said he was sorry for the way the complainant felt and also apologised for not responding to say sorry at the time of the incident as well as the behaviour of his friends. The accused agreed to write an e-mail to the complainant to back up his apology.

## Determination

116    The undisputed facts are that sometime past midnight on 17 June 2017, at the end of what had been by all accounts an enjoyable end-of-year social event for the staff and their guests, an incident occurred between the complainant and the accused in the function room. The complainant who had been described to be exuberant after the band had stopped playing in the Gilmour Room had whilst on her way out through the function room seized the accused’s wrist and alleged that he had molested her. The accused denied the allegation. According to him, he said, “Look, I’m gay. I wouldn’t have done that.” The complainant’s version was that the accused said, “Get Real! I'm Gay”. It is not in dispute that the accused is gay. The difference in their versions is immaterial.

117    It is not in dispute that the complainant had seized the accused’s wrist. This put the accused in close proximity to her. But where in the function room they were in close proximity and whether the accused’s left wrist was seized as alleged by the complainant (or right as alleged by the accused) were in dispute.

118    It is a fact that the accused and the complainant were unknown to each other. There is therefore no discernible motive for her to lie. However, this by itself does not mean that her evidence must be treated as ‘unusually convincing’ and safe to convict.

119    The defence had sought to show that the complainant’s perception may have been impaired by the alcohol that she had consumed. It is not in dispute that there was a free-flow of alcoholic drinks that evening. However, the complainant claimed that she only drank white wine spritzers as the wine did not taste good.

#### Where was the interaction between the complainant and accused?

120    The complainant and G stated that they walked diagonally across the function room towards the 1st archway which is nearer to the staircase that leads to the ground floor. G’s evidence was that he was speaking to people on the left-hand side as they were walking. On his evidence, the people he spoke to briefly were gathered by the tables near to the trophy cabinet on the left-hand side. However, it is not clear from his evidence whether those people were standing, sitting or walking. If the middle of the room was clear to traverse as per their evidence, then there could not have been people in the middle of the room on G’s left whom he was exchanging pleasantries with whilst walking. The complainant’s evidence on the people whom G was speaking to was simply that there were people walking on the left-hand side of G and ‘maybe hanging around the trophy area’.[^4] The trophy cabinets are alongside the left-hand and right-hand sides.

121    It is not in dispute that the complainant and G were at the left (3rd) archway when the defence witnesses saw them. There was no explanation elicited from the complainant and G as to why they allegedly chose to move from the middle of the room to the left archway. This is very significant as the accused’s defence is that he was never in the middle of the room but had instead passed through the left archway to go to the toilet and returned via the same way when the complainant seized his wrist at the place which he marked in the sketch plan P28B.

122    On the unchallenged evidence, the accused was at a table on the right-hand side near the 1starchway at around midnight when Natalie left to go to the toilet and to get some last drinks. When she returned, the accused was no longer at the table. The accused testified that he too had left to go to the toilet as he was planning to leave the event thereafter. I found that there was no reason for the accused to head towards the centre of the room at that point. He stated that he simply stood up and made his way and did not think or calculate which way would be more or less crowded. In fact, Natalie had also proceeded to the toilet via the left archway although she made her way back through the right archway as she was carrying drinks. I found the accused’s evidence that he made his way to the toilet by the most direct route from his table via the leftmost archway to have a ring of truth. I accepted his evidence on how he proceeded to the toilet and that he made his way back through the same archway.

123    The fact that the complainant and G admitted being at the leftmost archway (albeit that they claimed they moved there) supports the accused’s evidence. Accordingly, I found that the alleged incident could not have taken place in the middle of the function room.

#### Was the complainant walking or standing?

124    The complainant claimed to have been walking during the four to six seconds of the continuous and sustained contact which moved from her back to the bottom of her right buttock cheek. It was her evidence that the accused was on her right and about one or two steps behind her when she caught hold of his wrist.

125    The area around the left archway was described by the defence witnesses to be crowded as people were congregating around the cocktail tables and the left archway and also moving through as the left archway is closest to the toilets and the bar area, although the bar had closed by then. Apart from people who were already in the function room, people were also coming out of the Gilmour Room where the band had finished playing around midnight. Accordingly, I found it hard to accept that the accused had the space to follow the complainant in the crowded area and was able to maintain the sustained contact whilst she was walking.

126    On the complainant’s evidence, G was beside her and the incident lasted four to six seconds. The complainant’s claim was that the hand was on her buttock for one to two seconds before she stopped walking. On her evidence, the hand was still on her buttock when she stopped and moved her hand back to remove it. I found it hard to accept that the accused took no action to remove his hand but continued to maintain his hand on the complainant’s buttock even after she had stopped walking. If that was so, the accused was enabling her to catch him in the act. This was an unlikely scenario.

127    Further, if both the complainant and G were walking side by side and there was sustained contact, it was odd that G did not realise the close presence of the accused. On the evidence of G, he stopped walking when the complainant stopped. If that was indeed so and the accused was indeed behind the complainant with his hand cupping her buttock at that stage, then G ought to have seen the complainant grabbing the accused’s hand from her buttock. However, his evidence was that he did not see any contact by the accused with the complainant.

128    I rejected the evidence of the complainant that she seized the hand of the accused whilst it was still on her buttock. I accepted the accused’s evidence that he was making his way through the crowd and his hand which was trailing behind was seized as he was walking.

129    The complainant asserted that she was able to tell that the left palm was used to touch her based on the movement of the hand on her body. I found it hard to accept that the complainant was able to discern that it was the left (and not the right) hand which was in contact with her body over her clothes without actually seeing or before grabbing the hand. In my judgment, this was an exaggeration to bolster her claim that she had correctly seized the accused’s left wrist.

130    There is no evidence that the accused is left-handed. Nicola’s evidence was that the complainant had demonstrated on her by holding her right hand. If the complainant had wanted to demonstrate how she was touched, then she ought rightly to have used Nicola’s left hand if that was indeed the manner in which she was touched. Nicola’s evidence lent support to the accused’s evidence that it was in fact his right wrist that was caught. I noted that Jo’s evidence was that the complainant held Nicola’s left hand. However, I found the evidence of Nicola which was unchallenged to be more reliable as it was her wrist that was held and she had described the grip to be uncomfortable.

131    I did not find the complainant’s evidence that she caught the left wrist of the accused to be reliable. I was more inclined to accept the accused’s evidence that his right wrist was seized.

#### Did the complainant ask a series of questions?

132    The accused denied that the complainant asked him a series of three to four questions to which he did not respond. The complainant had in her testimony placed emphasis on the fact that the accused did not respond to her series of questions relating to his presence at the event. She claimed that she was able to remember very clearly that the accused did not reply to her first three or four questions.

133    In this regard, I have noted that during the mediation three days later on 20 June 2017 before the school counsellor, Mr Moody, she had read from a written account of what had transpired during the alleged incident. In it, she did not allege that the accused did not respond to her questions. Instead, what she stated was as follows:

> When caught red-handed and confronted, your response was flippant and aggressive.

> You flipped my grip off your wrist and told me "Get Real! I'm Gay" and walked off dismissively

The complainant’s written account tallied with the accused’s version. Accordingly, I found the failure to state the alleged questions asked in her script which was prepared about two days after the incident throws doubt on both the complainant and G’s evidence on the alleged questioning.

#### Was the complainant’s account of the nature of the alleged molest consistent?

134    The complainant’s evidence was that the accused’s hand was first placed on her back, moved down to the small of her back, to her right waist, the side of her right buttock and finally cupped her right buttock cheek and that she removed his hand whilst it was still on her buttock.

135    I observed that the complainant did not in her account three days later at the mediation session with Mr Moody state that her buttock was cupped. Her allegation then was that the accused’s hand “lingered” on her right buttock cheek. This is a different description of the alleged act. The particulars in the charge on which the accused was tried simply allege that the accused had run his hand down to the buttock cheek. There is no allegation of the hand lingering on or cupping the buttock. On the day of the alleged incident, the complainant had described her buttock as having been ‘grabbed’. The nature of the act of grabbing may be said to be close to or identical to cupping. But such an action is more intrusive than the hand lingering or simply being on the buttock.

136    Further, when the complainant demonstrated the alleged molest on Nicola, she demonstrated by running her hand on the side of Nicola’s body. This demonstration was significantly different from the complainant’s evidence on how the hand moved down the middle of the back to her waist and hip.

137    It is plain that the complainant’s description of the alleged molest had been inconsistent and there is no explanation for the significant variations.

#### What was the reaction of the complainant when touched?

138    On the complainant’s evidence, she reacted after about four to six seconds but said that it felt like forever. Her explanation for not having reacted immediately to see who was continuously touching her was that she was concentrating on who G was talking to and what he was saying. However, in response to my question on when G became aware of the incident, she said[^5]:

> My husband became aware of the situation because we were walking, we were walking together. I had to stop. I had stopped with Ben Henry’s wrist and because I stopped, he stopped talking to whoever he was **or maybe he wasn’t even talking** and he turned around and saw Ben Henry’s wrist in my hand and heard the conversation. (emphasis added)

The complainant’s evidence that her husband may not even have been talking is a clear contradiction of her explanation that she did not react immediately as she was listening to his conversation.

139    In any case, on her evidence, G was merely exchanging pleasantries. She gave examples of him saying goodbye, hello, see you next year and have a good summer. Such being the case, I fail to see how she could have been distracted by such small talk to the extent of ignoring the intrusive contact by which she felt violated. In my view, if the complainant had felt such a sustained intrusive touch which started all the way from above the small of her back and moved down to her waist, hip and her buttock, which she said felt like forever, it would have been natural for her to have reacted at the very least when the hand went to her waist or hip.

140    It was also her evidence that the touch felt like someone whom she knew ‘intimately wanted to fondle me’ and added “My husband doesn’t even do that in public.” She stated that she did not like people to come into her ‘safety social place’. Her lack of reaction is thus hard to accept. She claimed she had intended to turn around when the hand moved to her hip as she was shocked and thought to herself ‘who is this person feeling so comfortable and tactile’ but yet she inexplicably chose not to do anything until after the hand allegedly cupped her buttock and stayed there.

#### Was the complainant affected by alcohol?

141    The complainant claimed that she took two glasses of white wine spritzers and her husband took two or three for her but she did not finish half of any glass as they were removed when she was away from where she had placed them. Her evidence that she only drank spritzers is doubtful as she was seen holding a glass of red wine which spilled onto the dress of Brian’s girlfriend. The complainant was very evasive when asked if she had spilled wine on the dress and claimed that she had no memory of such an incident. Brian also testified that he later had to catch hold of the complainant when she lost her balance. However, the complainant also claimed that she had no memory of this. I found that the complainant was being evasive by claiming she had no memory of the two incidents because she would have been hard put to explain her behaviour if she were to admit what had happened.

142    Further, she also claimed that was unable to remember speaking to Marin after the band had stopped playing. Martin’s evidence was the complainant was repeating herself and invasive of social space which suggested to him she was under the influence of alcohol. I found no basis to doubt his observation.

143    Richard also testified that the complainant was unstable on her feet and swept her hand repeatedly to show him that people were ‘taking the piss’ at her. However, he said that he did not see anyone doing anything.

144    Accordingly, I found that the evidence suggested that the complainant may have had her perception affected by alcohol.

#### Conclusion

145    I found that the accused was near the left archway which was crowded as people were congregating and leaving the Gilmour Room after the band had stopped playing. I found that it was there that the complainant had grabbed the accused’s right wrist. In my view, the complainant in all probability must have perceived some form of bodily contact but it was unlikely to have been of the exact nature that she had described. I also did not find it safe to accept her evidence that she held onto the accused’s wrist whilst it was still on her buttock. In my view, as she did not turn around before she grabbed the accused’s wrist, it is probable that the contact with her may not even have been by the accused but by someone else in the crowd.

146    Accordingly, I did not find the evidence of the complainant to be ‘unusually convincing’ and therefore did not find it safe to convict on the complainant’s testimony. I found that the prosecution had not established the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and the accused was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal.
