### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       At the material time, the Accused was a passenger in a private hire vehicle. He claimed trial to these two charges:

> **_MAC 912182/2019_**

> _are charged that you, on 30 July 2019, at about 11.40 p.m., in a Grab car no. SJK2390J, at the carpark of Block 125 Yishun Street 11, Singapore 760125, did use insulting behaviour, to wit, by pointing your middle finger at \[PW2\] (Male / 23 years old at the material time), thereby causing him harassment, and you have committed an offence under section 3(1)(a) punishable under section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A,2015 Rev Ed)._

> **_MAC 912183/2019_**

> _are charged that you, on 30 July 2019, at about 11.40 p.m., in a Grab car no. SJK2390J, at the carpark of Block 125 Yishun Street 11, Singapore 760125, did use criminal force on \[PW1\] (Female / 21 years old at the material time), to wit, by touching her right upper thigh (over her dress) and groin area (over her dress), with the intention of outraging her modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on both charges. On MAC 912182/2019, I imposed a fine of $2,500 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment) and on MAC 912183/2019, I sentenced the Accused to eight months’ imprisonment.

3       The Accused has appealed against the conviction in this case.

## The Prosecution’s Evidence

4       Prosecution called a total of eight witnesses, comprising of PW1 (“Complainant”) and \[PW2\], the parents of \[PW2\], the Grab driver - one Ganaysan s/o Rangaya and various police officers. The Complainant and \[PW2\] were the key witnesses in this case.

### Evidence of the Complainant

5       The Prosecution’s case unfolded with the evidence of the Complainant.

6       The Complainant, female, 21 years old at the time of the offence, testified that on 30 July 2019 at about 11:38 pm, she was at the home of her boyfriend, \[PW2\] in Block 125 Yishun Street 11 when she booked a GrabShare to go home. Complainant explained that GrabShare was a ride on the Grab application platform which allowed a few people to carpool together when headed in the same direction. After booking a GrabShare, she went to the shelter with \[PW2\] to wait for the car[^1].

7       When the Grab car (“car”) arrived, Complainant got into the left side of the back seat. She testified that when she did so, there was already another passenger seated at the right side of the back seat. She smelt a “_hint of alcohol_” but was not able to state conclusively if it was the “_car air-con or the “alcohol smell….like it just smelled like a mix of air freshener and alcohol”[^2]._ After \[PW2\] shut the door of the car and the car started to move, Complainant testified that the passenger touched the back of her hair. She then flinched and he quickly pulled away. Complainant was very shocked and asked him: “_Are you drunk_”? The passenger replied ‘_no_” in a very sheepish manner with a sly look on his face[^3].

8       Shortly, the passenger again touched the back of the Complainant’s hair and the side of her shoulder. It was skin-on-skin as Complainant was wearing an off-shoulder dress. She testified that he quickly pulled away as soon as the driver looked back and he told the driver to “_mind your own business_”[^4].

9       A few seconds later, the passenger touched the Complainant’s inner right thigh and groin[^5] in a sweeping motion. In her testimony, she informed the Court that the passenger touched her inner thigh for three to five seconds and her groin area for three seconds. It was not a skin-on-skin contact. At that point, the driver looked back and asked her to sit in front. Complainant hesitated. She testified that she was intimidated and was afraid that the passenger would “_lounge_” at her. However, she eventually relented and moved to the front seat because she was very scared[^6]. In cross-examination, Complainant explained that the passenger began to be very “_violent_” – she described him as “_lounging forward in a very jerking motion_”; seated beside him, she felt the seat “_jerking a lot_”. The passenger was also “_very loud_”. Complainant decided it was much safer to sit at the front[^7].

10     The car moved on after Complainant got into the front seat. When the car came to a stop at the stop line[^8] after making its round through the carpark (in cross-examination, First Complainant explained that the car had to make one round before it was able to exit the carpark[^9]), Complainant saw her boyfriend, \[PW2\] still at the shelter next to the recycling bin[^10]. At that point, she requested to alight. She then went to \[PW2\] and told him what had happened in the car but inadvertently left her belongings in the car.

11     \[PW2\] then went to the car to retrieve her shoe bag. It was at this point in time the Complainant noticed that the passenger wound down the window and pointed a middle finger at \[PW2\][^11]. After the car drove off, Complainant and \[PW2\] then went up to his home and confided in \[PW2\]’s mother, \[PW7\]. Subsequently, \[PW2\]’s father, \[PW8\] drove them to Nee Soon Police Station to make a police report.

12     In court, Complainant pointed to the Accused as the one who “_looks like_” the passenger who was in the car with her that night[^12]. Whilst she appeared uncertain if the Accused in court was indeed the passenger in the car with her, no issue as to identity arose since there was no dispute that the Accused was in fact seated at the back seat of the car with the Complainant on the night in question.

### Evidence of \[PW2\]

13     In his testimony, \[PW2\] confirmed that on 30 July 2019 at about 11:40 pm, he was at the shelter under his block with his girlfriend waiting for the GrabShare car to arrive. When the car arrived, he opened the left door of the passenger seat for the Complainant to enter. He noticed another passenger seated on the right side of the passenger seat. In court, \[PW2\] positively identified the Accused as that passenger[^13].

14     As the car needed to make “_a round turn around this carpark_” before it could exit, \[PW2\] waited at his spot under the shelter for the car to leave the area. When he saw the car again after five to seven minutes, the car stopped at the stop line[^14]. \[PW2\] testified that Complainant then opened the door and ran towards him, saying that the passenger had molested her[^15].

15     The Complainant informed him that she was very scared and told him that she “_wanted to go_”.[^16] \[PW2\] then went to the car to retrieve her belongings. After he did so, \[PW2\] testified that the passenger wound down his window and “_probably said something_” which caused him (\[PW2\]) to turn his back to look at him[^17]. That was when the passenger pointed his middle finger at \[PW2\][^18]. \[PW2\] was shocked and went towards him and asked: “_What is wrong with you? What are you doing_”? At this point in time, \[PW2\] informed the Court that the driver looked “_stressed out_” and the Complainant was really scared and wanted to go. He then told the Grab driver “_just go; just go_”[^19]. \[PW2\] then brought Complainant back to his home.

16     In his home, \[PW2\] related what had happened to his parents who advised them to make a police report. \[PW2\] then used Complainant’s handphone to contact the Grab driver to inform him that they were going to make a police report and he (the Grab driver) was to meet them at the police station[^20].

## Assessment of the Evidence in the Prosecution’s Case

17     There may be several other witnesses in the Prosecution’s case but in my view, the strength of the Prosecution’s case rested mainly on the evidence of the Complainant and \[PW2\]. I assessed their credibility and the reliability of their evidence alongside the other pieces of evidence adduced by the Prosecution.

### The Complainant’s Account was clear and coherent

18     I found the Complainant to be a credible witness. She was straightforward in the giving of her evidence and I did not observe any tendency on her part to exaggerate the events that night or to embellish her account as she offered her testimony. As submitted by Prosecution, Complainant did not exaggerate her response to the Accused’s initial touching of her hair despite being repeatedly questioned by Defence Counsel[^21]. She was forthright and honest in admitting that she did not inform the GrabShare driver about what the Accused was doing, nor did she attempt to call her boyfriend up[^22] but was able to sufficiently explain why. Her overall account of the incident was logical and coherent and externally consistent with the surrounding evidence.

19     On the night in question, Complainant had booked a ride on GrabShare - a ride which required her to share a private hire vehicle with another passenger headed in the same direction. She boarded the car and sat in the back seat, beside the Accused who was in the car before her. After an unpleasant encounter with the Accused in the back seat, she moved to the front seat of the vehicle. On its way out, as the car returned to the shelter where she first boarded the car, she noticed her boyfriend \[PW2\] still there and requested to alight from the vehicle. The sequence and development of events from the time Complainant entered the car until the time she alighted, as described by her, was clear and reasonable.

20     At the point of boarding, Complainant entered into the back seat of the car[^23]. However, when she subsequently alighted from the car at the shelter, she got out from the front seat of the car. Her evidence that she had moved to the front seat sometime during the car’s brief journey through the carpark of Block 125 Yishun Street 11 was supported by the testimony of \[PW2\] who witnessed her coming out of the car from the front seat[^24] when she had clearly boarded the car in the back seat. According to \[PW2\], he also retrieved her bag from the front passenger seat. But for the unwelcomed advances of the Accused as described by the Complainant, there could be no other plausible explanation why she would have made the decision to move to the front of the car in such a short period of time when she had declined to do so at the point of boarding[^25].

21     In this respect, I was aware that the GrabShare driver PW3 Ganaysan s/o Rangaya (“Mr Ganaysan”) who had picked the Complainant up that night, testified that he did not stop the car for her to move to the front seat. I accept that this aspect of his evidence was contrary to the Complainant’s account. However, I did not find this discrepancy to affect the strength of the Complainant’s account which was fully corroborated by the evidence of \[PW2\]. There was no basis to suggest that Complainant and \[PW2\] had colluded in respect of this aspect of the evidence. Further, I was satisfied that Mr Ganaysan’s contradiction on this detail did not amount to a material discrepancy.

22     Further, the undisputed evidence before this court was that Complainant booked the GrabShare ride to go home – her home being in Bukit Batok[^26]. It was also undisputed that even before the car made its way out of the carpark of Block 125 Yishun Street 11 shortly after she had boarded it, she chose to alight from the car when the car returned to exact same point where she had first boarded it. That would not make sense at all since there was no conceivable reason why Complainant would abort her journey home prematurely when the car had not even left the carpark of Block 125 Yishun Street 11. The only reasonable explanation for the Complainant doing so was her shocking encounter with the Accused at the back seat of the car whilst the car was making its way around the carpark to exit. She was so frightened that in her bid to get out of the car as soon as she could once she saw \[PW2\], she even left her belongings behind in the car such that \[PW2\] had to retrieve them for her from the front seat of the car.

23     I was aware that the evidence before the Court as to the time taken for the car to travel from the pick-up point back to the pick-up point differed between the Complainant/\[PW2\] and Mr Ganaysan. However, that did not trouble me. A discrepancy of this nature as to time may be attributed to fallibility in estimation and/or recollection of events between witnesses. The crucial (and undisputed) part of the evidence was the fact that the Complainant had in fact alighted at the same point where she had been picked up only shortly before. This key portion of the evidence remained firmly intact on all accounts.

### The Complainant’s Account was well-corroborated

24     The Complainant’s account of the incident was well-corroborated and consistent with the surrounding evidence:-

> (a)     Her description of events was corroborated by the evidence of Mr Ganaysan. He testified that he picked the Complainant up from Yishun area that night. After she boarded his car, she sat at the back passenger seat, on the left side. However, within one to two minutes of the journey (as estimated by Mr Ganaysan[^27]), she requested to be dropped off at the same place where she was picked up. Mr Ganaysan complied;

> (b)     The first reaction of the Complainant towards the Accused was heard by Mr Ganaysan. Mr Ganaysan testified that after she had boarded his car and it started to move off, he heard her ask the Accused: “_Are you drunk_?”[^28]. He was unaware of the context in which this question was asked by Complainant but it was clear from his evidence that he distinctly heard his female passenger utter those words. The testimony of Mr Ganaysan directly substantiated Complainant’s account and her spontaneous reaction to the Accused’s offending acts towards her;

> (c)     Mr Ganaysan’s testimony that he did not witness the Accused touching the Complainant in the car that night did not affect the strength of her evidence. The fact that he did not witness the incident did not mean that it did not take place. It bears noting that at the material time, Mr Ganaysan was seated in front and driving the car when both the Complainant and the Accused were seated in the back seats. The offences against the Complainant occurred when the car was in motion, not when it was stationary. It would be reasonable to expect Mr Ganaysan’s sense of sight to be largely focused on the road, not on what was happening behind him in the rear passenger seat. In my mind, it also did not trouble me that the Complainant testified that the GrabShare driver had seen the Accused touching her[^29]. I agree with the Prosecution that such differences may arise due to differing perspectives[^30];

> (d)     The Complainant’s assessment of the state of the Accused, evidenced by the words “_Are you drunk_”, when he began acting inappropriately towards her at the back seat of the car, had good basis and was consistent with the observation made by Mr Ganaysan. Mr Ganaysan confirmed several times whilst on the stand that the Accused who was “_sent_” to his car by a friends that night (prior to him picking the Complainant up), smelt of alcohol and was drunk[^31]. The Complainant’s spontaneous reaction to the Accused that evening was not something fabricated.

25     Defence took issue with the fact that the Complainant’s only reaction to the Accused at the point when he was alleged to have touched her were the words “_Are you drunk?_”; that she also made no complaint to the GrabShare driver Mr Ganaysan who was in the car with her. The contentions of the Defence in this regard are without merit. I agree with the Prosecution that the conduct and/or reaction of the Complainant in the entire incident was reasonable and within the realm of human responses expected of a victim of sexual assault[^32]. Suggestions by the Defence to Complainant that she should have reacted when in the car by saying: “_Why are you touching me_” or “_Stop touching me_” or failing to tell Mr Ganaysan there and then what the Accused was doing to her[^33] only served to unfairly straitjacket her as a victim of a sexual assault[^34]. The Complainant explained that she was overwhelmed and scared during the entire episode[^35] and her explanations as to why she may not have responded in a way Defence would have preferred, were valid. Given the situation she found herself in, I was satisfied that her reaction and conduct at the material time was wholly reasonable.

### The Complainant’s Account was externally consistent

26     The Complainant’s conduct post-incident and the events which swiftly developed after she alighted from the car, were also consistent with her experience in the car that night:

> (a)     Apart from aborting her journey home, upon alighting from the car, the Complainant immediately informed \[PW2\] that the Accused had molested her[^36]. Both of them went up to \[PW2\]’s home where the same was recounted to \[PW2\]’s mother, \[PW7\]. The critical points of the encounter where the Accused had molested the Complainant at her “_bottom”,“private parts_” were information which were communicated by the Complainant[^37] at that point in time;

> (b)     Acting on the complaint, using the Complainant’s mobile phone, \[PW2\] contacted the GrabShare driver Mr Ganaysan. He told him they were going to make a police report and then requested Mr Ganaysan to meet them at the police station[^38]. There was no dispute that the Accused was brought to Yishun North Neighbourhood Police Centre (“Yishun North NPC”) at about 11:30 pm that night[^39];

> (c)     That same night in his home, \[PW2\]’s father, \[PW8\] learnt that the Complainant had been molested. He then used his company van to drive both the Complainant and \[PW2\] to the same police station where the Grab car was headed to. A police report was lodged on the same night;

> (d)     The car driven by Mr Ganaysan proceeded to the police station as requested by \[PW2\]. At Yishun NPC on the night of 30 July 2019, PW3 Station Inspector Mohamed Sahir (“SI Mohamed Sahir”) was deployed to do counter duties. At about 11:30 pm, a car pulled up in front of the NPC. According to SI Mohamed Sahir, the Grab car driver informed him that he had two passengers in a GrabShare ride and one of them had been molested[^40]. The Accused who alighted from the car was subsequently placed under arrest for outrage of modesty[^41].

27     Piecing together the evidence adduced through various testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses, it was clear that the flow of events arising from the Complainant’s encounter with the Accused in the back seat of the car that night was as clear as it was spontaneous. The events were not contrived in any way and could not have been made up.

28     Considering the totality of the evidence before the Court, I was satisfied of the reliability of the Complainant’s testimony. Apart from the coherence of the Prosecution’s evidence, I found that the Complainant had no reason to falsely implicate the Accused - somebody whom she did not know or had met prior to the incident on 30 July 2019. On the evidence, it was clear that the Complainant herself was afraid and was reluctant to report the matter to the police. On all accounts, it was \[PW2\]’s mother, \[PW7\] who was adamant about making a police report after she learnt about it[^42]. If it was a lie against the Accused which Complainant had made up, it was inconceivable why she would stand by her lie all the way to trial, undergo rigorous cross-examination and even had to be re-called as a witness in the later stages of the trial. On the stand, the Accused himself conceded that there was no reason for the Complainant to make false accusations against him[^43].

### Evidence of \[PW2\]

29     I similarly found \[PW2\] to be a credible witness. He provided a straightforward account of what he witnessed that evening after his girlfriend the Complainant had boarded the car.

30     His account was clear and logical. He was at the pick-up point after ushering his girlfriend into the vehicle. He then waited at the shelter whilst the car made its round through the carpark before it exited. When he next saw the car, the Complainant had alighted from the car and ran towards him, telling him that she had been molested by the other passenger. As she left her belongings in the vehicle, \[PW2\] had to be the one to approach the car to retrieve her belongings from the vehicle. When he did so, he gave clear testimony that the Accused, who was the passenger in the back seat, showed him his middle finger. It did not matter that \[PW2\] could not remember which hand the Accused had used; the key evidence was that \[PW2\] had seen the Accused use a middle finger at him.

31     \[PW2\]’s account was well-corroborated by Complainant. Complainant testified that when \[PW2\] went forward to collect her belongings from the car, she was looking at \[PW2\]. It was then that she noticed the Accused winding down his window and sticking out his middle finger at \[PW2\][^44]. When re-called as a witness, she further confirmed that she did notice the pointing of the finger by the Accused. She stated that “_he stuck it out and it was very obvious…..it was very prominent_”[^45]. The shelter area was lighted[^46]. She could see well and she was certain that the Accused directed the gesture at \[PW2\] as the Accused’s eye contact was with \[PW2\]; the Accused “_wasn’t looking at \[her\] at all_”[^47]. \[PW2\] was also the one facing the Accused; not the Complainant[^48].

32     Again, the fact that the GrabShare driver Mr Ganaysan did not witness the Accused pointing the middle finger at \[PW2\] did not mean that such an incident did not happen. There was no clear evidence before the court as to the various positions of Mr Ganaysan viz-a-viz the Accused and/or \[PW2\] at the material time such that Mr Ganaysan should have or would have seen the Accused pointing his middle finger at \[PW2\].

33     As with the Complainant, \[PW2\] had no reason to make up this portion of the evidence against the Accused. The Accused was unknown to him prior to the incident. \[PW2\] had no personal knowledge of what had taken place in the car and he had approached the car only with the intention of retrieving the Complainant’s belongings. It was only when the Accused showed him the middle finger that he (\[PW2\]) was shocked and he went towards the Accused and said: _“…..what is wrong with you? What are you doing_?”[^49]. Mr Ganaysan testified that at some point, he recalled \[PW2\] shouting at the Accused[^50] after Complainant had alighted from his car.

34     The reaction of \[PW2\] (or lack of one) to the Accused’s molest of his girlfriend and to the showing of the middle finger by the Accused was criticised by the Defence. However, as far as \[PW2\] was concerned, it was clear from his testimony that his first instinct was to bring the Complainant to safety i.e. to bring her home. He did not even think of asking the GrabShare driver Mr Ganaysan if he had seen his girlfriend being molested[^51]. All he wanted to do was to retrieve Complainant’s belongings from the car. As \[PW2\] explained, this was the first time something like that had happened to him; he did not know how to handle it properly; he was shocked[^52]. I found \[PW2\]’s response to the situation at that time to be understandable and reasonable in the circumstances; there was no need for \[PW2\] to conform to any standard of behaviour.

35     On scrutinizing the evidence, I did not find any basis to suggest that there was collusion between Complainant and \[PW2\] in any aspect of their evidence. I found both of them to be credible witnesses and their testimonies were reliable and well-corroborated by the surrounding evidence. There may have been some discrepancies within the Prosecution’s case (for example, whether the Complainant went up to \[PW2\]’s flat that day[^53]) but I found these discrepancies to be minor in nature and did not affect the strength of the Prosecution’s case.

## The Defence’s Case

36     The Accused’s defence did not raise a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case.

37     The crux of the Accused’s defence was essentially that he could not have committed the offences, even though he did not remember what had happened after he consumed two different hard liquors and fell asleep at the table[^54]. Defence Counsel submitted that the “_Accused was too drunk to even walk, let alone talk_”[^55]. The Accused’s evidence was that he was very drunk[^56]; he did not know how he got into the car and the next thing he woke up, he was already at the police station[^57]. The Accused was absolutely sure he did not commit the offences that night in question on the basis of his good character and good up-bringing[^58].

38     I accept that the Accused was drunk on the night in question. By all accounts, the Accused was observed to be and described to be drunk. In the Accused’s own testimony, he admitted he was “_really drunk_” and that he was “_extremely….high…..intoxicated_”[^59]. The Complainant smelt alcohol when she got into the vehicle. GrabShare driver Mr Ganaysan repeated no less than three times in the course of his testimony that the Accused was drunk and that he was “_sent_” to the car by a friend. At the police station, SI Mohamed Sahir confirmed he smelt alcohol on the Accused. \[PW8\] (\[PW2\]’s father) testified that the Accused “_looked like he was drunk_” when he saw him at the police station[^60]. I had no doubt that the Accused was drunk that night.

39     Having said that, I found that the Accused was not so drunk to the state of being unconscious such that he would have been unable to commit the offences alleged:

> (a)     There was no corroboration of the Accused’s assertion that he was so drunk to the state of being unconscious on the night in question. Karim, a friend referred to by the Accused in his testimony, was not called as a witness; neither were any of the Accused’s friends with whom he stated he was playing basketball and drinking with that evening. None were called as witnesses to attest to the Accused’s state of drunkenness;

> (b)     The Accused was expected to pay for his GrabShare ride in cash. According to Mr Ganaysan, the Accused was “_sent_” to his car by a friend. Although his friend Karim had made the booking for him, the booking itself appeared to indicate that the Accused was supposed to pay Mr Ganaysan in cash at the end of the trip[^61]. If the Accused was completely unconscious due to his intoxication, how would the Accused’s friend have expected the Accused to pay for his ride home?;

> (c)     The Accused was observed to be in control of his basic physical abilities and mental faculties. SI Mohamed Sahir, the police officer on duty at the Yishun North NPC that night testified that after the Grab car pulled up in front of the NPC, he witnessed the Accused alighting from the car and walking away from the police station. SI Mohamed Sahir managed to stop him and told him to follow him to the NPC for an interview. The Accused complied. According to SI Mohamed Sahir, the Accused walked in a normal manner[^62];

> (d)     Whilst the Accused did smell of alcohol, had slurred speech and could not answer some questions asked of him, the clear evidence before the court was that at the NPC, the Accused was not in an unconscious state. The Accused tried to leave the interview room on his own[^63]; he could also follow SI Mohamed Sahir’s instructions, for example to face the wall so that he could be handcuffed[^64]. PW6 SSSgt Wilson Sze (“SSSgt Wilson Sze”) similarly testified that when the Accused was placed under arrest, he was able to comply with instructions such as placing his hands against his back and being able to walk to the police car without assistance[^65].

40     I accept the evidence of the police officers stationed at Yishun NPC that night. Based on the consistent accounts of the police officers, the Accused was conscious at the material time. The behaviour exhibited by the Accused at Yishun NPC in the presence of police officers was not that of a person “_totally drunk_” since if one was “_totally drunk_”, there would have been no way such an individual would have been able to walk away on his own or complied with the instructions of police officers. The absence of any evidence in the form of footage from closed circuit television camera (“CCTV”) in Yishun NPC and/or body-worn cameras did not affect the reliability of the evidence of the police officers who dealt with the Accused that night at the NPC[^66]. For one, SI Mohamed Sahir was able to sufficiently explain why he was able to remember this incident involving the Accused so well[^67].

41     The bare assertions of the Accused that he could not have committed the offences in question that night simply because he had been “_brought up well_”, that his character is “_not like that_” and that it was not in his character “_to do this kind of things_” [^68] was insufficient to cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case. The totality of the evidence before me bore out the fact that the Accused was indeed intoxicated that night but not to the point of being unconscious or rendering him incapable of committing the offences in question, even if he could not remember what he did.

42     The evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, particularly the Complainant and \[PW2\], was consistent in painting a picture of an individual who was capable of committing the alleged offences, albeit in a drunken state. As noted by the High Court in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Wong Hoi Len_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 146</span> at \[44\]: “_those who voluntarily imbibe alcohol must, in the usual course of events, take full responsibility for their subsequent offending_”. Even if the Accused could not remember what he had done on the evening of 30 July 2019, he would have to bear the full responsibility, as well as the consequences, of his actions.

43     In fact, since he could not remember what had happened after he had consumed the alcohol (as he stated so in his defence), I found it somewhat odd that he was able to assert that he could not have committed and/or did not commit the offences against the Complainant and \[PW2\]. In the face of cogent evidence adduced in court which reflected what happened that evening, the Accused should confront the likelihood that in his state of intoxication, he had committed the offences against the Complainant and \[PW2\].

44     The defence of intoxication under section 85 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, was not available to the Accused. There was no objective evidence before the Court that the Accused was so intoxicated at the material time that he could not form the requisite mens rea[^69]. In any case, the Accused had voluntarily consumed alcohol on the evening on 30 July 2019.

## Conclusion

45     On the evidence, I found the following:

> (a)     The Accused who was a complete stranger to the Complainant, had used criminal force on the Complainant, by touching her right upper thigh (over her dress) and groin area (over her dress) whilst seated with her in the back seat of a Grab car when sharing a ride. He had done so with intention to outrage her modesty;

> (b)     In showing his middle finger at \[PW2\] which in itself was insulting, I found that the Accused did intend to harass \[PW2\]. \[PW2\] was harassed by the action of the Accused.

46     On the totality of the evidence in the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that both the actus reus and mens rea elements of both the charges had been made out. The Prosecution had proved her case on both charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I thus found the Accused guilty and convicted him on both charges.

47     The Accused is currently on bail, pending the hearing of this appeal. A stay of execution has been granted on the serving of the sentence and the payment of the fines.
