\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9106/2019/01\]

23 May 2019

### District Judge Toh Yung Cheong:

1       In the early hours of 20 May 2018, the accused was working as a bouncer at Club Hollywood, a nightspot located at St. James Power Station. An incident occurred in the club around 2.26am. This led to the accused and other members of the club’s security team attacking a group of rowdy patrons and causing some of them very serious injuries. The fight only stopped when the police arrived at 3am to break up the fight.

2       As a result, the accused and a number of other security staff were charged for rioting under s.147 of the Penal Code. The accused eventually pleaded guilty to the following charge:

DAC 934698 of 2018

You, on 20 May 2018, between 2.26am to 3.00am at St James Power Station Club Hollywood, located at No.3 Sentosa Gateway Singapore, together with Muhammad Shahreen Azril Bin Rosli, Mohammad Irfan Bin Raman, Iszman Bin Sulaiman, Yit Hong You Jeffrey, Mohd Azrin bin Hussain, Frank Lui and Tay Boon Huat were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to Tan Song Chew, Tay Shao Bin Joshua and Tay Shao Qiang David, and in the prosecution of the common object of the assembly, the members of the unlawful assembly used violence by punching and kicking the said Tan Song Chew, Tay Shao Bin Joshua and Tay Shao Qiang David, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

3       After considering the pre-sentence reports and the submissions of the prosecution and the defence, I sentenced the accused to reformative training with a minimum period of detention of 6 months. As the accused has appealed against the sentence imposed, I will now set out the reasons for my decision.

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

4       The following facts are extracted from the Statement of Facts which the accused admitted to without qualification.

#### The incident

5       The victims were patrons of the Club at the material time. They are:

5.1     Tan, a 32-year old male.

5.2     David, a 33-year old male

5.3     Joshua, a 29-year old male

6       On 20 May 2018, the victims were drinking at the Club with some friends. They had a dispute amongst themselves and sometime before 2.26 a.m., they were told by Shahreen to leave the Club. Shahreen then ushered some of the victims’ friends out of the Club.

7       As they were walking out of the Club, the victims’ friends continued to be rowdy. At around 2.26 a.m., the accused grabbed Joshua’s neck from behind Joshua. Joshua turned around partially, and the accused punched him on the face several times. Following this, the accused and Joshua exchanged punches. Shahreen joined in to punch and kick Joshua. Irfan punched and kicked Joshua multiple times. Jeffrey kicked and punched Joshua.

8       David and Tan stepped in to help Joshua and bring him to his feet. Shahreen punched David. Iszman kicked and punched David. The accused punched David in the face and on the body. Azrin exchanged punches with David. Frank punched David. At some point, David fell to the floor because of the assault and the accused stomped on him twice.

9       The accused threw Joshua on the floor and stomped on him multiple times. Shahreen also stomped on Joshua.

10     Frank punched Tan multiple times on the head. At some point, Tan fell to the floor due to the assault. The accused kicked him twice on the torso and twice at his face while he was lying on the ground. At some point during the fight, Tay joined in and behaved aggressively and swung punches.

11     The fight only stopped when the police arrived to break up the fight at 3.00 am.

12     The fight was captured on CCTV footage.

#### The victims’ injuries

13     The victims were conveyed to Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) by ambulance.

##### TAN’S INJURIES

14     Dr Livia Teo, a Consultant with the Singapore National Eye Centre, prepared a medical report on Tan dated 29 June 2018. According to the medical report, Tan suffered the following injuries:

14.1     Left eye: subconjunctival haemorrhage with chemosis, 9x4mm cornea abrasion, microscopic hyphaema, iritis and commotio retinae, pupillary sphincter rupture, periorbital hematoma with limited ocular motility, left retrobulbar haemorrhage with fracture of the left orbital floor;

14.2     Right eye: subconjunctival haemorrhage; and

14.3     Mildly displaced nasal fracture.

15     Tan underwent a left floor fracture repair with orbital implant. He then underwent a repeat surgery with examination under anaesthesia. As of 25 June 2018, Tan still had some pain on eye movement with binocular diplopia, and residual limitation of upgaze and mild residual periorbital edema and hematoma of the left eye. He was hospitalised from 20-22 May, 5-8 June and 14 June 2018.

##### DAVID’S INJURIES

16     Dr Mohamed Madeena Faizur Rahman, a Resident Physician at the Department of Emergency Medicine, SGH, prepared a medical report on David, dated 11 June 2018. According to the medical report, David suffered the following injuries:

16.1     Mild tenderness over the left maxilla and mild bruising over the right forehead;

16.2     Abrasion over both upper and lower lips;

16.3     Multiple superficial abrasions over both arms and knees;

16.4     Mild tenderness over the right proximal interphalangeal joint; and

16.5     Comminuted fracture of the proximal phalanx of right little finger with intra articular extension.

17     David was given tetanus toxoid and analgesia, and a buddy splint was applied to his finger fracture. He was given hospitalisation leave from 20 to 26 May 2018 (7 days).

##### JOSHUA’S INJURIES

18     Dr Seah Zeyen, a Medical Officer at the Department of Emergency Medicine, SGH, prepared a medical report on Joshua, dated 7 June 2018. According to the medical report, Joshua suffered the following injuries:

18.1     Mild bruise over his left eye;

18.2     Swelling and tenderness over his left maxilla and temporal region; and

18.3     Cephalohematoma over his occiput.

## ANTECEDENTS

19     The accused has no previous convictions.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS

20     The prosecution’s submission adopted the two-stage analysis set out in _PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ \[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449 (“Al-Ansari”). While the prosecution recognised the importance of rehabilitation for an accused person under the age of 21, the DPP submitted that specific deterrence was nevertheless a key sentencing consideration and highlighted the following:

20.1     The accused and the other club employees were tasked to ensure the safety and security of the club’s patrons

20.2     The way in which the accused assaulted the victims.

20.3     The prolonged nature of the assault.

20.4     The severity of the victim’s injuries

20.5     The offence was one of group violence.

20.6     The safety of the public was affected

20.7     The offence engendered public disquiet.

21     In light of the above factors, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of reformative training would strike the appropriate balance between rehabilitation and deterrence.

## SENTENCE OF CO-ACCUSED

22     The prosecution informed the Court that the accused’s colleague, Muhammad Shahreen Azril Bin Rosli (“Shahreen”), pleaded guilty to a single charge under s.147 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

23     The prosecution submitted that the accused was more culpable than Shahreen as:

23.1     The accused was the aggressor who delivered the first blow.

23.2     Shahreen only assaulted two of the victims while the accused assaulted all three victims.

## MITIGATION

24     The defence tendered a written mitigation plea which highlighted the following points:

24.1     The accused graduated from ITE College West with a Higher Nitec in Security System Integration in May 2019. He has applied to further his studies in a polytechnic.

24.2     On the day in question, at 2.30am, the accused had completed his duty of playing recorded music at the Club where he was employed. The accused was then required to perform his duties as a security officer, which were to check the patrons to ensure that they were over 18 years of age and that no prohibited items were brought into the club.

24.3     The accused was informed by his colleague that a group of men were creating trouble at the back of the club. He saw one of the men punching someone. Counsel later clarified that the accused saw Shahreen being assaulted by Joshua, though that was not captured by the video camera.

24.4     The accused and his friends (i.e. the security officers), went to “pull the aggressor but things went out of control and there was sudden violence” (Mitigation plea at \[6\]). However, their original intent was to de-escalate further violence.

24.5     The offence was not premeditated as it happened suddenly.

24.6     The accused was only 19 years of age at the time of the offence.

24.7     The accused had completed the 45th Ship for Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Program in 2018.

24.8     The accused was of good character as evidenced by the various testimonials enclosed with the mitigation plea.

## DECISION ON SENTENCE

25     The decision on sentence is divided into four parts:

25.1     Part I: Availability of Reformative Training and Probation as sentencing options.

25.2     Part II: Approach Adopted

25.3     Part III: Applicability of Deterrence and Rehabilitation as sentencing principles in this case.

25.3.1       The individual prospects for rehabilitation.

25.3.2       The seriousness of the offence

25.4     Part IV: Ensuring that the sentence reflects all applicable sentencing principles.

### Part I: Availability of Reformative Training and Probation as sentencing options.

26     The accused was 20 years of age at the time of his conviction for an offence which was punishable with imprisonment.

27     He is therefore eligible for probation under section 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252) as well as reformative training (“RTC”) under s.305(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”). Section 305(1) of the CPC states:

\[T\]he court may impose a sentence of reformative training in lieu of any other sentence if it is satisfied, having regard to his character, previous conduct and the circumstances of the offence, that to reform him and to prevent crime he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre.

28     The pre-sentence reports state that reformative training and probation were suitable sentencing options for the accused.

### Part II: Approach Adopted

29     Taking into account the guidance of the High Court in _PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ \[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449 (“Al-Ansari”), I adopted the following steps:

29.1     I noted that for offenders below the age of 21, rehabilitation was often a dominant sentencing consideration. Therefore, it was important to form an assessment of the prospects for the accused’s rehabilitation based on the probation pre-sentence report, the Reformative Training pre-sentence report, as well as the evidence presented to the Court by the prosecution and defence.

29.2     Next, I looked at whether the seriousness (or heinousness) of the offence would lead to rehabilitation being diminished or even eclipsed by the sentencing considerations of deterrence and retribution.

30     After careful consideration, I found that the seriousness of the offence meant that deterrence was a relevant and applicable principle in this case. Rehabilitation was not the sole or dominant sentencing consideration.

31     Having made this finding, I had to ensure that both applicable sentencing principles were reflected in the sentence as the applicability of two principles meant that one could not operate to the exclusion of the other: _Al-Ansari_ at \[62\].

### Part III: The Applicable Sentencing Principles

### Individual Prospects for Rehabilitation

32     The probation pre-sentence report indicated that the prospects for the accused’s rehabilitation were good. The accused came from a stable family and his parents’ appeared willing to be more involved. The relatively good school reports suggested that he was able to follow rules. Finally, I noted that the accused was also not a hardened or recalcitrant offender.

### Seriousness of the offence

33     The second stage in the process set out in _Al-Ansari_ requires the Court to consider the seriousness of the offence. In order to assess offence seriousness, the Court had to look at the harm or potential harm caused as well as the culpability of the accused. In _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ \[2016\] 1 SLR 334, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon endorsed the two-stage process set out in _Al-Ansari_ and further noted at \[30\]:

But rehabilitation is neither singular nor unyielding. The focus on rehabilitation can be diminished or even eclipsed by such considerations as deterrence or retribution where the circumstances warrant. Broadly speaking, this happens in cases where (a) the offence is serious, (b) the harm caused is severe, (c) the offender is hardened and recalcitrant, or (d) the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable.

34     In _Muhammad Zuhairie Adely bin Zulkifli v Public Prosecutor_ \[2016\] 4 SLR 697 at \[26\] Justice Chan Seng Onn referred to the above passage and noted that it was not necessary for all four factors \[i.e. those listed in (a) to (d)\] to be present before a court can find that rehabilitation has been displaced as the primary sentencing consideration.

##### HARM / POTENTIAL HARM

35     Serious injuries were caused to multiple victims. Tan suffered a fracture of the left orbital floor and a mildly displaced nasal fracture. As a result, he had to be hospitalised. David suffered a fracture on one of his fingers and was given 7 days’ hospitalization leave. While Joshua’s injuries were less serious, the cephalohematoma over the back of his head indicated that blows were aimed at his head, a vulnerable part of the body and it is fortunate that he did not suffer more serious injury.

36     The scale of the violence increased the harm and potential harm caused by the offence. Apart from involving multiple persons, it also lasted for more than 30 minutes. The violence was only brought to the end after the police arrived to break up the fight.

37     The accused’s actions would also have caused fear and terror amongst patrons and members of the public in the general vicinity. There was also a risk that the violence could spread and that innocent bystanders could be hurt.

38     The fact that the security staff of the Club violently attacked patrons of the club would also generate disquiet amongst the general public who expect security staff to maintain order and ensure the safety of the club’s patrons.

##### INDIVIDUAL CULPABILITY

39     Even if I accepted that the accused saw one of his colleagues being assaulted, I was of the view that this did not reduce his culpability.

40     The facts clearly state that before the incident occurred, none of the three victims laid a finger on the accused. Yet the accused grabbed Joshua and assaulted him.

41     When David and Tan moved to assist Joshua and help him to their feet, the accused and his colleagues attacked them. At separate points during the incident, the accused:

41.1     Stomped on David after he had fallen to the floor.

41.2     Threw Joshua to the floor and stomped on him multiple times.

41.3     Kicked Tan twice on the torso and twice on his face while he was lying on the ground.

##### OTHER MITIGATING FACTORS

42     I noted that the accused had pleaded guilty and appeared to be remorseful. On the other hand, I noted that the probation pre-sentence report at page 3 noted that one area of concern was that the accused “minimised his involvement and attributed his actions to the immediate environment in the club.”

##### CONCLUSION ON SERIOUSNESS OF OFFENCE

43     I found that this is a case where a higher level of harm was caused and that the accused had a high level of culpability. The indicated that there was a need for deterrence, both specific and general. In conclusion, I was of the view that rehabilitation was diminished but not totally eclipsed by deterrence and that both were applicable sentencing considerations.

### Part IV: Ensuring that the sentence reflects all applicable sentencing principles

44     After the completing both steps of the _Al-Ansari_ analysis I had to consider the various sentencing options to decide on a sentence that would reflect the applicable sentencing principles. Given that there has been a change in the Reformative Training Regime since _Al-Ansari_ was decided, I referred to the Parliamentary Reports to confirm that Reformative Training continues to address the rehabilitative needs of the offender. During the second reading of the Criminal Justice Reform Bill, the Senior Minister of State for Law, Ms Indranee Rajah, stated:

Besides community sentences, the Bills also make major changes to another sentencing option that is focused on rehabilitation – the reformative training (“RT”) regime. The RT regime is specifically geared towards the rehabilitation of young offenders. It emphasises both discipline and rehabilitation in a structured environment, where officers provide supervision and guidance to the RT trainees. The trainees will go through programmes that will help them take charge of their rehabilitation. They will need to soberly reflect on their offences, on how to stay crime-free, and on how to strengthen their relationships with their family.

…

The proposed changes reflect this deeper understanding, allowing SPS to take on a risk and performance-based approach in determining the intensity of intervention in RTC for the trainee. A key feature of the proposed changes is that the minimum detention period for reformative training will be reduced from 18 months, to six or 12 months, depending on the intensity of the rehabilitation the offender requires. This will be based on the time required for programming to mitigate the risks and address the needs of the RT trainees, according to their profiles.[^1]

45     Taking into account the recommendation in the Reformative Training pre-sentence report as to the appropriate intensity of rehabilitation, I sentenced the accused to a term of reformative training with a minimum period of detention of 6 months’. At the time of preparing this judgment, the accused is on bail pending appeal.
