## Statement of Facts for POHA Charge

8       In respect of the POHA charge, Gavin admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification:

## The Background

9       The background to the offences for which both the accused claimed trial can be found in the SOF for the POHA charge.

## The Case for the Defence

10     Gavin’s defence was that any contact between his hand and the victim was accidentally caused by the victim moving forward towards him. Neo, on the other hand, denied any contact with the victim. He alleged that he merely stretched out his hand at the material time to grab his son and pull him away from the victim to prevent any contact.

11     The accused persons gave evidence in their own defence. One Tan See Hua, a senior language specialist with the Criminal Investigation Department, was also required by the Defence to give evidence.

## The Prosecution’s Case

12     The Prosecution relied on the evidence of the victim (Yow Meng Pung) who was a police inspector and his partner one Muhammad Syabil Bin Baharudin (“Syabil”), a Police Sergeant. The Prosecution also relied on the video footage (exhibit P1) captured by the victim’s body-worn camera (“BWC”). The audio transcription of the footage can be found in exhibit P2. The Prosecution had also admitted by consent the conditioned statements of some witnesses including Tan See Hua[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). These witnesses were respectively involved in the procuring of the body worn camera footage of the victim, compiling it into one single video file, and in the translation and transcription of P1.

13     The Prosecution also called the Grab driver Zakariah Kassim (“Zakariah”) to give evidence and to produce his in-car video footage. See exhibits P4A, P4B and P4C.

14     The footages from the BWC and the in-car camera were screened in court.

## The Offence

15     Section 353 of the Penal Code reads as follows:

> _353\. Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person in the lawful discharge of his duty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine, or with both._

16     The elements to be proven for a conviction on a s 353 charge are:

> (a)     that the victim of the criminal force was a public servant;

> (b)     that the accused used criminal force to such public servant;

> (c)     that the accused used criminal force on the public servant when the latter was in the execution of his duty as such public servant[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

17     In the present case, it was clear that the victim was a public servant in the execution of his duty. In fact, both the victim and his partner Syabil were in police uniform and were in a patrol car before they were approached by the accused persons and the Grab driver, to help resolve the dispute between the Grab driver and the accused. See also SOF at \[3\] and \[7\] to \[12\]. Accordingly, the only element in contention was whether each of the accused persons had intentionally used criminal force on the victim.

## Analysis of the Evidence

18     The circumstances leading to the offence under the s353 offence were briefly stated in the SOF above. For completeness, I will highlight some details.

19     It was not disputed that the accused persons and Mok Yoke Yee (“Mok”) had hired a Grab vehicle driven by Zakariah (the “Grab driver”). Mok was Neo’s wife. The vehicle had an in-car camera which captured the events that happened from the moment the Grab vehicle arrived at the scene. They called for the Grab vehicle after their dinner and drinking session which ended at about midnight.

20     When Zakariah arrived by the roadside, Gavin asked if Zakariah could wait for them to finish smoking. Zakariah refused Gavin’s request. Gavin was clearly irritated by the refusal, but nevertheless, he told Neo to throw away his lighted cigarette. Neo was not happy to have had to waste his cigarette. While in the vehicle, Gavin had a heated dispute with Zakariah and hurled vulgarities at him.

21     Along the way, the accused saw the victim’s patrol car and they alighted from Zakariah’s vehicle to seek the police assistance. Neo called out Zakariah to follow them to talk to the police to resolve the dispute.

22     Upon encountering both accused persons, Mok and Zakariah, the victim and Syabil assessed the situation and separated the disputing parties. The victim’s encounter with the accused persons was captured by the victim’s BWC, exhibit P1. The transcription of P1 was admitted as P2.

## Admissibility of the in-car camera footage

23     At this juncture, I will deal with the defence’s objection to the admissibility of exhibits P4A, P4B and P4C, the Grab driver’s in-car camera footage. I agreed with the Prosecution that the facts depicted in P4A. P4B and P4C were relevant facts under s9 of the Evidence Act (“EA”) as they were necessary to explain the facts in issue. I was of the view that these exhibits provided the backdrop as to why the victim engaged the accused persons at the relevant time. It also explained why the victim decided to let Zakariah leave the scene and the mental state of the accused persons at the material time.

24     With respect, the objections raised by counsel pertained to the weight of the exhibits and not its admissibility. Counsel conceded that the in-car camera and the SD card satisfied the requirements in s116A (1) of the EA but not the computer. Counsel questioned the accuracy of the video and contended that it could have been altered or it did not capture all events. A perusal of s116A(1) of the EA shows that it did not deal with relevance or admissibility but only with accuracy. Counsel also highlighted that there were no faces to identify to whom the voices belonged to and hence it was prejudicial. With respect, the submission by counsel was misconceived. I was of the view that Zakariah would be in a position to identify the speakers. In the circumstances, I admitted exhibits P4A, P4B and P4C into evidence under section 5 EA. Zakariah had given evidence as to how the footage was transferred from the car’s dashcam camera to his old phone and computer. He confirmed the video files were the same and unaltered or corrupted. There was no evidence that he had deliberately tampered with the video files or that it did not capture accurately the entirety of the incident. He denied he had edited the video files. He did not know why there was a 20-second gap. I had no reason not to accept Zakariah’s evidence. After all, he was not an interested party in the present case. In any event, even without these exhibits P4A, P4B and P4C, Zakariah’s evidence could also shed light as to what happened during the short trip in his car before the encounter with the police officers as well as the demeanour of the accused persons.

## Conduct of Parties leading to the altercation with the Police Officer

25     I found that while the 2 police officers were investigating into the dispute between the parties, they requested Gavin and Neo to provide their particulars. They refused and asked the police to find out what Zakariah wanted[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). The victim repeatedly warned Gavin that he was being uncooperative, but Gavin retorted that he was not talking to him.[^4] Gavin agreed that he was frustrated, uncooperative and hostile towards the victim.[^5]

26     The driver and the accused persons were separated by the Police to ensure a safety distance and to avoid dispute. The victim proceeded to interview Zakariah by the side. Having determined that Zakariah had no issue with the accused persons and that there was no offence disclosed on the part of Zakariah, the victim allowed him to leave. Thereafter, the victim returned to engage Gavin and Neo without telling the accused persons that he had allowed Zakariah to leave. Gavin took issue with how the victim was speaking to them, and told him “don’t be so rude”.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) Neo then noticed Zakariah’s car driving past them, and both accused then angrily questioned the victim as to why he had allowed Zakariah to leave.

27     I agreed with the Prosecution that the “building up to the timestamp of 00:40:16 of P1, Gavin and Neo’s frustration towards Yow escalated, and Gavin’s hostility increased even further into outright anger against Yow. As Gavin himself confirmed, his unresolved anger towards Zakariah also turned onto Yow. From the timestamp of 00:40:16 to 00:40:21 of P1, the BWC footage captures a violent jostling and shouting. The next clear image seen is the parties separated by some distance, with both Yow and Syabil having stepped back and with their hands stretched out in front of them in a defensive manner. At this time, Syabil had further placed one hand on his baton in anticipation for physical engagement. Yow shouted “Stop pushing”, while Syabil further repeatedly told Gavin to calm down. Gavin and Neo were held back by Mok, who placed herself in front of the two of them and stretched out her hands to prevent Gavin and Neo from approaching Yow and Syabil. Mok further pointed towards Gavin, and told him “It’s wrong. You cannot” in Chinese”[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

## Conduct subsequent to the altercation

28     I found that immediately after the altercation, the victim’s left hand pointed towards Gavin and asked him why he pushed him[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8). I accepted the victim’s explanation that he used the words “ who pushed me” at the material time as he was “traumatised”. He confirmed that he meant to ask Gavin, “why you push me”. This explained why the victim had pointed an accusing finger at Gavin. I also found that after the pushing, the victim immediately accused Gavin directly “You don’t call me bro, you touch me first”[^9], to which Gavin replies “_cunt_ (in Hokkien), I talk to you, I talk”[^10]. The victim then called for backup while Gavin made a call to police to complain about the victim. When Neo was speaking to the victim, the latter told Neo “Can see you being rough to us as well”.[^11]

29     Subsequently, when the victim and Syabil were leaving in their patrol car, Neo attempted to stop them from leaving by standing in front of the patrol vehicle and placing his hand on the patrol car.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) Neo even challenged the victim to “come lah” when the victim asked him to leave and not touch the car.[^13]

## The _Actus Rea_ of Both the Accused

30     I found the victim to be a credible and truthful witness. He had been a deputy team leader of the Ground Response Force in Jurong West NPC. When he gave evidence in court, he was an Investigation Officer in Jurong Division. His evidence was consistent and clear. There was no reason for him to falsely implicate the accused persons. His evidence was substantiated by P1. Based on P1 at 00:40:16 – 00:40:21, Syabil’s testimony and the evidence of the victim in court[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14), I found the victim was first pushed by Gavin with his right hand on the victim’s left chest area.[^15] The victim was clear and consistent during his cross-examination that Gavin pushed him on his left chest area[^16]. Moreover, the victim candidly acknowledged that after he was pushed by Gavin, he pushed back the accused persons. My finding was consistent with the fact that immediately before the pushing, Gavin who openly declared he had drunk alcohol, had been belligerent and confrontational towards the victim. He not only called the victim “idiot”[^17] but also hurled other abusive words at him at close range. He stood closely in front of the victim. He even challenged the victim by saying “who the fuck do you think you are”[^18] and threatened him “Yow Peng Mun, I will see you soon”[^19]. Gavin’s fiery anger and frustration finally escalated into pushing the victim. Before the pushing, Gavin had already turned his anger towards the victim.[^20] The pushing was also witnessed by Syabil who testified that Gavin moved forward towards the victim, and pushed him[^21]. Syabil confirmed that his view was focused on Gavin. At the material time, Syabil was standing to the right side of the victim and the left of Gavin. In the circumstances, I had no doubt at all that Gavin did use his hand to push the victim at his upper body area, namely the left chest area, to deter him from discharging his duty.

31     Next, I found Neo did push the victim on his upper body area after Gavin had been pushed back by the victim. The victim testified that after he had pushed back Gavin, Neo stepped closer towards the victim with his right hand across the victim’s upper body area and pushed him on his front chest right arm area[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22). Clearly, Neo did this in retaliation against the victim having pushed his son. The victim’s evidence was consistent with Neo’s evidence that he had stretched out his right hand across the victim at the material time.[^23] Neo also conceded during his examination-in-chief that when he grabbed his son away from the Chinese officer (the victim), he had physical contact with the Chinese police officer.[^24] Neo also admitted that his arm was “near the body of the Chinese police officer”[^25]. In these circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that “ Neo had moved forward towards and stretched his hand across Yow’s upper body area immediately preceding Yow feeling a push in that same region, is that Neo had pushed Yow.”[^26] My finding that Neo had pushed the victim was also supported by the fact that when the victim directly confronted Neo and alleged that he was pushed by both accused persons, neither Gavin nor Neo responded contemporaneously to these accusations by the victim. It was also clear that Neo naturally responded in the way he did to the victim as his son had been pushed back by the victim. I also had no doubt that at the material time the victim was discharging his duty. The police officers were there to resolve the issue the accused had with the Grab driver and to maintain peace and order.

## The shaking footage in P1 from 00:40:16 – 00:40:20 corroborates the Pushing by both accused persons

32     I also agreed with the Prosecution that “f(F)ollowing the shouting at 00:40:16, the BWC footage on P1 shakes in an uncontrolled manner up till about 00:40:21, when P1 now shows that Yow and Syabil had stepped back some distance from both accused persons. The footage thus clearly supports the fact that there had been pushing at this time – a fact that Yow and Syabil attested to, and Gavin agreed with.”[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) In my view, this footage further supported the victim’s evidence that he had been pushed by the accused persons.

## The Contemporaneous Reaction

33     Based on P1 from 00:40:21 onwards, I noted that the victim and Syabil were moving away from the accused persons and the victim shouted, “stop pushing”.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) The victim also accused Gavin that “you are the one pushing” and “you touch me first”.[^29] He also pointed an accusing finger at Gavin. There was no denial by Gavin that he did not push the victim. On the contrary, his immediate reaction was one of abusive word in an aggressive tone, “cunt (in Hokkien), I talk to you, I talk”[^30]. I also noted that the reaction of Syabil was to get ready to take out his baton in anticipation of further physical engagement[^31]. In view of Gavin’s aggression, Syabil had to repeatedly tell Gavin to “relax” and “calm down”.[^32]

34     In light of the above, I agreed with the Prosecution that the “immediate reactions of Yow and Syabil are entirely consistent with the fact that Gavin and Neo had pushed Yow. There is no other conceivable reason for Yow and Syabil to have reacted the way they did otherwise, and indeed, the Defence provided no alternative reason for these contemporaneous reactions by the two.”[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

35     As highlighted by the Prosecution, Mok’s reaction also supported the fact that both Gavin and Neo had pushed the victim. Based on P1 from 00:40:25 onwards, I found Mok moved to stop the accused persons from advancing towards the victim. At the same time, Mok, while pointing and looking at Gavin said, “it’s wrong, you cannot”.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) In my view, Mok was clearly reproaching Gavin for pushing a police officer. My view was fortified by the fact that the Defence has failed to call Mok to give evidence. She was in the best position to explain the situation. But the Defence failed to call her to give evidence despite knowing full well the case put by the Prosecution to Gavin[^35].

### The Mens Rea

36     It is trite that the element of intention is rarely, if ever, proved by direct evidence; it is inevitably to be inferred from the surrounding circumstances.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) In this respect, I examined the surrounding circumstances, the conduct and behaviour of the accused persons immediately before and after the altercation. There was no doubt that the accused persons had been drinking before the incident and they had a heated dispute with Zakariah. They wanted the victim and Syabil to settle their dispute. In the course of their conversation, Gavin told the victim to “Talk properly. Sorry, we drank alcohol”[^37]. After the altercation, he also told Syabil that “someone is drinking … you don’t play this kind of shit”.[^38] I accepted the Prosecution’s submission “that the necessary implication to be drawn from these two statements were that Gavin had drunk to an extent that he was quicker to get angry if provoked. There is simply no other reason for Gavin to bring up his having just drank alcohol in the context of these two instances, as his drinking is otherwise irrelevant to why Yow should “talk properly”, or why Yow should not “play this kind of shit”.”[^39]

37     Based on the recording captured in P4A at 00:29:17; P4B at 00:30:06; P4C at 00:30:51; P4C at 00:30:57 and P4C at 00:30:59, I found that the temper of both the accused persons was high before they approached the police officers to settle their dispute with Zakariah, the Grab driver. I was of the view that their heightened temper did not abate even when the police officers engaged them. This was especially obvious after the victim had allowed Zakariah to leave. See above at \[26\] and \[27\].

38     Next, I found the accused persons were uncooperative towards the police officers, particularly towards the victim. The police officers were there to facilitate the dispute between the Grab driver and the accused. But both the accused persons repeatedly refused to give their particulars to the police officer. Gavin, in particular, responded defiantly towards the victim. See P2 at pages 12 -13.

39     Based on the tone of the voice and behaviour of Gavin, I was of the view that Gavin was aggressive and hostile towards the victim throughout their interactions. See also P2 at pages 11-13[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40). It was without doubt that both the accused persons were upset when the victim allowed Zakariah to leave[^41]. This also contributed towards Gavin’s aggression towards the victim. In fact, Gavin conceded he was not happy with the victim[^42]. He also hurled vulgarities at the victim and jabbing his finger at close range towards the victim.[^43] Gavin agreed that after the victim had let the Grab driver go, his frustration and hostility increased even further into outright anger against the victim[^44].

40     Considering the circumstances, the state of anger and aggression shown by Gavin, I have no hesitation in finding that Gavin thereby intentionally used abusive words to the victim and pushed him.

41     I will now deal with Neo’s _mens rea_. When the victim and Gavin were pushing each other, Neo was standing nearby looking at the victim.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45) Neo responded a few times that the victim pushed him and Gavin[^46]. In this respect, I rejected Neo’s denial that he saw the victim pushed Gavin. In light of these circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that Neo, who was already upset with the victim for letting Zakariah leave, saw the victim pushed his son and immediately retaliated against the victim by intentionally pushing him on his upper body area.[^47]

## The Unusually Convincing Standard

42     Counsel submitted that the ‘unusually convincing’ standard should apply to determine the issue of whether Neo had pushed the victim. With respect, I disagreed. In my view, the present case was not one where the victim’s uncorroborated testimony formed the sole basis for a conviction which would have required the unusually convincing standard to be applied.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48) In the present case, the victim’s evidence against Neo was corroborated by the BWC footage in P1. The shaking footage in P1 from 00:40:16 – 00:40:20 corroborated the victim’s evidence that he had been pushed by both accused persons. Neo’s silence when confronted by the victim that he had laid hands on him was also corroborative of the victim’s evidence[^49]. Neo’s evidence that he had stretched out his right hand across the victim at the material time was also consistent with the victim’s evidence against Neo[^50]. Mok had also stepped in front of both Gavin and Neo and holding them back to prevent both accused from further physical contact with the victim.[^51] The conduct of Mok was clearly supportive of the allegation of a scuffle involving both Gavin and Neo against the victim.

43     In any event, even if the ‘unusually convincing’ standard were to apply, I was of the view that there was no reason to doubt the victim’s evidence that Neo had pushed him. I found the victim’s evidence to be unusually convincing. There was no reason for the victim who was a Police Inspector to falsely implicate the accused whom he had not met before the incident. In fact, I found the victim to be a credible witness. See above at \[30\] and below at \[50\]-\[51\]. The victim’s evidence was also consistent with (a) Neo’s evidence that he had stretched out his right hand across the victim at the material time and (b) Neo’s failure to rebut the victim’s accusation that Neo had laid hands on him. The victim’s testimony was also consistent with the conduct and behaviour of the accused persons and the video footage in P1. In the circumstances, I was of the view that the victim’s evidence was unusually convincing to convict Neo on his charge.

## Evaluation of The Defence

44     Gavin claimed that it was the victim who moved towards him and accidentally touched his hand which was outstretched and gesturing at that time, and was holding onto his phone[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52). At the same breath, he claimed that there “could have” been contact but he did not see it.[^53]

45     Neo claimed that he had no contact with the victim. He alleged that he grabbed Gavin away to maintain a distance between Gavin and the victim.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54)

46     With respect, I rejected the respective defences of both the accused persons. Both the victim and Syabil denied Gavin’s allegation that the contact with the victim was accidental[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55). Syabil was clear that the victim was stationary when Gavin stepped forward to push him, and that the victim moved forward after Gavin had pushed him.[^56] There was no reason for Syabil to falsely implicate the accused. Hence, I accepted Syabil’s evidence.

47     Next, I was of the view that the respective defences of the accused persons were inconsistent with the BWC footage in P1. At the material time, P1 recorded the violent shaking of the footage which indicated that there was contact with the victim. The shaking footage was also inconsistent with Gavin’s allegation that the victim could have come into contact with his fingers. It was also highlighted by the Prosecution that the mere accidental contact with Gavin’s fingers, or the act of Neo grabbing Gavin, could not have resulted in the violent shaking of about 5 seconds captured in P1 between 00:40:16 to 00:40:21.[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) And I agreed with the Prosecution that the violent shaking was more consistent with the victim’s evidence that there was an exchange of pushes.

48     Finally, the alleged defences by the accused were also inconsistent with the spontaneous and contemporaneous reactions of the parties at the material time. For example, the accused’s defences were inconsistent with the fact that the victim and Syabil had to step back and for Syabil to place his hand on his baton in anticipation for physical engagement. “There would be no reason for Mok to hold both accused persons back and tell Gavin that he was “wrong”. There would be no reason for Yow to accuse both Gavin and Neo of pushing him, and further no reason for Gavin and Neo to not refute Yow’s claims if they were baseless.”[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58)

49     Counsel submitted that Gavin should be given the benefit of doubt. With respect, I found there was no basis for the submission and rejected it. I agreed with the Prosecution[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) that Gavin was belligerent and uncooperative to the victim. His aggression and hostility culminated in him pushing the victim. Gavin’s push was supported by P1, the victim’s evidence, Syabil’s evidence as well as by the contemporaneous reactions of the victim, Syabil and Mok. In light of the overwhelming evidence, I therefore had no reasonable doubt at all that Gavin intentionally pushed the victim in anger.

## Credibility of the Prosecution Witnesses

50     The victim and Syabil had not met the accused persons before the incident. There was no reason for them to lie in court. I found them to be credible witnesses who gave consistent and textured evidence, and did not seek to embellish their accounts. The victim candidly admitted that he had pushed both Gavin and Neo.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) He also agreed that he did not see who pushed him the second time but surmised based on his observations that Neo had pushed him.[^61] Syabil also candidly admitted that as his focus was on Gavin at the time, he could not remember if Neo pushed the victim[^62].

51     Next, I found both the evidence of the victim and Syabil were consistent with the footage recorded in P1 which was highlighted above. Their evidence was also consistent with the defiant behaviour and conduct of the accused persons. There was, therefore, no reason not to believe in their evidence. In fact, counsel for the Defence also credited Syabil for being a fair and objective witness[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63).

## Credibility of the Accused

52     On the other hand, I found both the accused persons to be evasive and untruthful witnesses. I found their respective evidence to be inconsistent with the objective evidence. See above at \[47\]-\[48\]. I found Gavin lacked credibility and was not forthright in answering when questioned in court. This can be discerned when he asked for the questions to be repeated[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64) or did not answer to the questions directly[^65]. “He also feigned inability to hear the clear audio of Mok telling him “it’s wrong, you cannot”, and defensively refused to answer the Prosecution’s put that he did not deny Yow’s contemporaneous accusations of pushing as “it will be unfair to me””[^66]. He did not even want to admit to the fact that immediately after the pushing, the victim had said to him “You are the one pushing” as reflected at page 23 of P2. Instead, he said he cannot remember and asked for the relevant video footage to be replayed[^67].

53     I also noted that Gavin amended his Case for the Defence on the first day of the trial. By amending it at this late stage would seem to suggest that he was tailoring his evidence. It shows his lack of credibility. He amended \[11\] of his Case for the Defence to state “Mr Gavin Liang ShaoHui avers that he had gestured at the Complainant without any intention to touch the Complainant and the physical contact between the Complainant and him was the result of the Complainant moving closer or towards him”. This was different from his original Case for the Defence (dated 30th August 2020) which was that the “1st Accused avers that he had merely raised his hand by reflex to fend off the Complainant who happened to become closer to him.”

54     Likewise, Neo also amended his Case for the Defence on the first day of trial. See \[13\] of the Case for the Defence. Neo’s original Case was that the “ 2nd Accused avers that his action was purely accidental and non-intentional and the said action was by reflex due to the Complainant's proximity to the 2nd Accused. The contact with the Complainant was inadvertent and with minimal force.” The amended Case states “ the 2nd Accused Mr Neo Keng Hock avers that the subject video footage from the Complainant’s body camera shows that at that material time, he was standing at a distance further away from the Complainant and subsequently, Mdm Mok Yoke Yee came between him and the Complainant. The 2nd Accused Mr Neo Keng Hock avers that there should have been no physical contact between him and the Complainant himself said in the subject video footage that he did not know who had touched him. The 2nd Accused had not used physical force on the Complainant or the 2nd Accused had no physical contact with the Complainant and hence, no physical force had been used to deter the Complainant from discharging his duty as a public servant.” In my view, Neo was also tailoring his evidence after the disclosure given by the Prosecution. It also shows his lack of credibility.

55     Next, I found Neo to have given inconsistent answers. He not only backtracked from his earlier evidence that he had spoken to Zakariah whilst the police were trying to separate them but also gave three mutually-exclusive accounts that he was talking to himself,[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) talking to his wife,[^69] and lastly that he did not have a good memory and could not remember[^70]. In another instance, Neo initially confirmed repeatedly during examination-in-chief that at the time of pushing, he was looking at the victim and Syabil.[^71] But Neo then backtracked and said he “can’t really remember” whether he looked at Yow.[^72]

56     Even during his examination-in-chief, Neo could not maintain a consistent answer. Initially, Neo said that when he grabbed his son away from the victim, he came into physical contact with his wife who was in front of him while his son was behind him. However, he then changed his evidence to say he came into physical contact with the Chinese police officer.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) Later, he changed his version by saying that there was no contact with anybody[^74].

57     I also noted that during the cross-examination, Neo confessed that he was not able to remember things now as he had a short-term memory[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75).

58     Neo’s evidence was also inconsistent with Gavin’s testimony in respect to a material issue as to whether the BWC was shaking because there was physical contact between the inspector and at least one person on the scene at that time. Gavin said there was such physical contact but Neo disagreed.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) I also found Neo to be evasive and not forthright when asked whether he had heard the words “ can see you being rough to us as well”[^77].

59     In these circumstances, I was of the view that Neo was not a credible witness.

60     Having concluded that both the accused were unreliable and not credible witnesses, I therefore did not believe their evidence given in their defence.

## The Transcriber’s Testimony

61     The Defence submitted at \[12\] of the Defence’s closing submissions that the transcriber Ms Tan See Hua’s testimony was “inherently unreliable and pure conjecture and illogical”. With respect, I disagreed. Ms Tan See Hua was a Senior language specialist from CID. She had given her conditioned statement and was called by the Defence to give evidence. She had 13 years’ experience in transcribing and translating between English, Mandarin and Hokkien. She testified categorically that she did hear the words “chao chee bye” from Neo even though the Defence alleged that Neo was a distance away from the victim. There was no reason for the transcriber to lie. I believed in her evidence.

## Guilty and Convicted

62     Having considered all the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that both the accused persons had intentionally pushed the victim on 5 June 2019, whilst he was in the execution of his duty as a police officer and public servant, with the intent to deter him from discharging his duty. Accordingly, I found the accused persons guilty and convicted them of their respective charges under s353 of the Penal Code.

63     As for Gavin, he had indicated during the trial that he was pleading guilty to the POHA charge. He also admitted to the SOF stated above and was accordingly found guilty and convicted of the said charge.

## Gavin’s Antecedents

64     Gavin was untraced.

## Neo’s Antecedents

65     Neo was traced for a number of traffic offences committed in 1984. This was the first time that he was convicted of an offence under s353 of the Penal Code.

## Sentencing Submission by Prosecution

66     In respect of Neo, the Prosecution submitted for an imprisonment term of 4 weeks. As for Gavin, the Prosecution submitted for an imprisonment term of 6 weeks for the charge under s353 Penal Code and for a fine in respect of the POHA charge.

## Mitigation and Sentencing submission by Defence

67     Counsel for Neo submitted that the contact by Neo with the victim was fleeting in nature and minimal. Moreover, it was only one-off. It was out of his character in light of his clean record. It was submitted that Neo’s act was a reaction by a “nerve impulse”. The Court was also reminded that just before the commotion, Neo was focusing on his phone wanting to make a call.

68     Counsel also submitted that no weight or negligible weight should be given to Neo’s post-commotion conduct. It was highlighted that prior to the commotion, Neo did not act aggressively. Any questioning and expression of indignation by Neo should not warrant a custodial sentence.

69     In the circumstances, it was contended that Neo’s culpability was low and a fine of $2,000 would suffice for his offence[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78). However, at \[21\] of the Defence’s submission on sentence, it was revised to $2,500.

70     With the greatest respect, I did not see the relevance of counsel’s reference to the _Parti Liyani’s_ case in our present case. See \[6\] of the Defence’s written submission on sentence dated 22nd February 2022.

71     As for Gavin, counsel highlighted that Gavin was untraced. He should be given a fine for both his offences. If a custodial sentence was warranted for the s353 offence, the sentence should be less than 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

72     Counsel submitted that the physical contact between Gavin and the victim was minimal, of a short duration and practically no harm was caused to the victim. It was also contended that the physical contact was out of Gavin’s character.

73     Counsel for Gavin highlighted that he was indignant and uttered abusive and insulting words on the victim as the latter had let the Grab driver go without hearing both sides’ respective versions of the event.

74     As for the POHA offence, Gavin had pleaded guilty. Counsel submitted for a fine of $2000 for this offence.

## Sentencing Considerations

75     S 353 of the Penal Code provides for punishment of imprisonment for a term up to 4 years, or a fine, or both. The punishment for the POHA offence is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both.

76     Considering the nature and gravity of the s353 offence, the main sentencing considerations must be one of general deterrence and retribution.

77     I agreed with both the Prosecution and Defence that the _Aw Soy Tee_ sentencing framework[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79) is applicable in the present case for the s353 offence. It was also not disputed that for both the accused, the sentencing band was a fine or up to 3 months’ imprisonment (Category1 of _Aw Soy Tee_ framework). I also noted that the High Court in _Aw Soy Tee_ at \[45\] highlighted that fines are rarely imposed for s353 offences.

78     Having considered the non-exhaustive list of factors enumerated in _Aw Soy Tee_ at \[24\], I agreed that the present case was one of low-harm and low culpability which falls within Category 1 of the _Aw Soy Tee_ framework. I concluded that the applicable presumptive sentencing range was a custodial sentence of 4-6 weeks’ imprisonment. I also found no relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that warranted taking the starting sentence out of the applicable presumptive sentencing range of 4-6 weeks’ imprisonment.

79     I will now proceed to elaborate and deal with the relevant factors in determining the harm and culpability of both the accused persons.

80     First, I found there was negligible physical injury or hurt caused to the victim by both the accused’s pushing. Although it was a one-off push by each of the accused persons, it must be highlighted that the duration of the confrontation leading to the commission of the offence was long which was a relevant culpability-enhancing factor[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80). This will be elaborated below at \[81\] and \[82\]. In any event, as was highlighted in _Aw Soy Tee_ at \[58\], “custodial sentences are imposed even in cases where the force in question is nothing more than “minimal, fleeting contact” .

81     Next, I considered the circumstances leading to the commission of the offence by the respective accused persons. It was clear, as depicted in the video footage captured in P1, that both the accused were blatantly uncooperative at the outset and openly defiant to the victim who was a high ranking police officer holding the rank of an Inspector and was in uniform. For example, unlike Zakariah, they refused to provide their particulars to the victim. When Neo noticed the Grab driver was let off, he sarcastically said “ walao eh, you all police”[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81). After the incident, Neo mocked and scoffed by saying “I like you very much”[^82] and “okay la, you very, you very impressive”[^83]. He also used abusive word “smelly cunt”[^84] in Hokkien. Neo even sought to challenge and confront the victim to “come”[^85] when stopping the victim and Syabil from leaving in their police car by standing in front of the police car with his two hands on the bonnet. In respect of Gavin, his demeanour clearly demonstrated that he was disrespectful and defiant[^86]. I found him to be particularly provocative, aggressive, and hostile towards the victim during their interaction. “On three instances, Gavin purposefully stepped close towards Yow within an uncomfortable distance, and speaks in a confrontational way:

> (a)     P1 at 00:32:53 – Gavin steps forward towards Yow within half-an arm’s length distance, and blocks his view of Neo. At the same time he asks Yow “what is the issue” in a challenging manner;

> (b)     P1 at 00:34:43 – Gavin again steps forward towards Yow within less than a half-arm’s length as he challenges Yow “then what you want”;

> (c)     P1 at 00:34:52 – Gavin moves even closer towards Yow, now just a palm-sized distance from Yow, and stares confrontationally at Yow and says “then”.”[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87)

82     It was not disputed that Gavin was gesticulating at the victim with his hand holding on to his mobile phone. In fact, Gavin’s aggression was heightened after the victim allowed Zakariah to leave the scene.[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88) I also noted that besides jabbing his finger at the victim, Gavin ominously said “Yow Peng Mun, I will see you soon”[^89]. Just before the pushing, Gavin yelled and pointed at the victim at close range and shouted “who the fuck do you think you are”[^90] and called him “idiot” ( which was a subject matter of the POHA charge). He continued to behave in a hostile manner towards the victim after pushing him by threatening him again – “Yow Meng Pun, I will see you soon”[^91] and calling him “stupid inspector”[^92], “trash”[^93] and “bloody inspector”[^94]. In my view, looking at the context and having viewed the video footage (P1), Gavin’s behaviour was clearly intimidating even though he disagreed that the words “Yow Meng Pun, I will see you soon” were a threat. He even mocked and jeered at the victim saying, “Inspector don’t mean anything”[^95]. To him it was “shit”[^96]. Gavin even approached the victim at close range to take a photo of the victim and mockingly asked him to smile[^97]. Such provocative behaviour must not be condoned. “To cap things off, Gavin at trial openly declared his lack of remorse.”[^98] See NEs, Day 8 at page 47 Lines 15 – 32.

83     Next, I noted that there were two offenders involved.

84     In the present case, there were no exceptionally mitigating factors. I was of the view that both the accused had shown no remorse.

85     I gave due weight to the submission that the offence was one-off and out of character. The fact that both the accused had no similar antecedent was a neutral factor. In any event, these were not exceptional factors that warranted a departure from the presumptive sentence indicated at \[78\] above. The High Court[\[note: 99\]](#Ftn_99) has also exhorted that there is a need to protect law enforcement officers who are exercising their duties.

86     I noted in the mitigation plea at \[18\] that counsel conceded that Neo had some drink and was in a celebratory mood before the commission of the offence. Gavin took part in the drinking session too[\[note: 100\]](#Ftn_100). This was also reflected in the SOF. Although there was no evidence of the level of intoxication in respect of the accused persons, but it is common knowledge that alcohol intake does have an effect on one’s behaviour depending on, among other things, the amount of alcohol consumed. In fact, Neo admitted he had drunk alcohol, talking longer and a bit rough[^101]. This may also explain why Gavin bluntly told the victim that they had drank alcohol and asked him to talk properly[^102]. Gavin also told Syabil, that “someone is drinking…you don’t play this kind of shit”[^103] which appeared to suggest that he was under the influence of alcohol. In any event, I did not consider the fact that the accused had drinks in my consideration for sentencing.

87     I also concluded that there were no significant offender-specific aggravating factors which may warrant an upward adjustment of the presumptive sentencing range.

88     Having considered the above, in respect of the s353 offence, I was of the view that the custodial threshold has been crossed. The circumstances were not exceptional as to merit the imposition of a fine. For the factors stated above, I was of the view this was clearly not a case which laid at the lowest end of the low-harm, low-culpability spectrum for a s 353 offence. In the circumstances, I sentenced Gavin to a jail term of 6 weeks’ imprisonment. In respect of Neo, I sentenced him to an imprisonment term of 4 weeks as he was less culpable than Gavin in terms of his aggressiveness and hostility towards the victim.

89     In respect of the POHA charge, having considered the case of _PP v Chua Kok Thye_ _<span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 125</span>[^104]_ cited by the Prosecution, the confrontational attitude and challenging manner of Gavin and the abusive words uttered, I imposed a fine of $3000 for the POHA offence committed by Gavin. This was also in line with the sentence imposed in _PP v Stephen Albert[^105]_, wherein a fine of $3,000 was levied for vulgarities similarly used by Gavin.

## Sentencing Precedent

90     In his submission, Counsel placed much reliance on _Public Prosecutor v An Heejung_ _<span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 59</span> (“An Heejung”)._ With respect to counsel, I disagreed that the present case was similar to _An Heejung ._ In _An Heejung_, the facts as highlighted by the court was exceptional. It was a case decided pre -_Jeffrey Yeo_[^106]. In the present case, based on the video footage captured in P1, it can be seen that the behaviour of the accused persons, particularly in relation to Gavin, was clearly disrespectful, defiant, and belligerent. It finally culminated in criminal force being used on the victim by both the accused persons. In _An Heejung_, unlike the present case, the offender was sleeping and suddenly kicked the victim twice on his chest upon being awaken by the victim. Moreover, unlike the present case, there was no prior disorderly behaviour, or open defiance or challenge of authority by the offender. In the circumstances, I had no doubt at all that the present case was clearly distinguishable from _An Heejung_.

## Conclusion

91     I was of the view that the sentences were appropriate and commensurate with the overall criminality of the accused persons.

92     The sentences meted out to the accused persons were in line with the sentencing precedents (_PP v Neo Rong Hao Benjamin_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 9160 of 2017/01), _PP v Stephen Albert_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 9254 of 2017)) cited by the Prosecution. In _PP v Stephen Albert_, the offender was imprisoned 4 weeks for spitting at the police sergeant. In _PP v Neo Rong Hao Benjamin_, the High Court sentenced the offender to five weeks’ imprisonment for pushing the officer’s chest. Unlike the present case, the offenders in these 2 cases had pleaded guilty. Hence, the accused in the present case would not be entitled to any sentencing discount which was usually accorded to plead guilty cases.

93     Finally, the sentences imposed for the s353 offence reflected the need to give effect to the principles of deterrence and retribution.

94     Both the accused persons are currently on bail pending appeal.
