27 July 2021

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## INTRODUCTION

1       There are two appeals arising from my decision on this case. The first is an appeal against conviction and sentence filed by the Accused. The second is an appeal against sentence filed by the Prosecution.

2       The Accused had claimed trial to three charges of outrage of modesty, allegedly committed against his three step-daughters at the material time. He was found guilty and convicted after a trial. As the Accused was related to the victims at the material time, I have redacted the name of the Accused and all the witnesses in these grounds of decision so as to protect the identity of the victims.

3       I now set out the grounds of my decision.

### The charges

4       The Accused claimed trial to the following three charges:

>     3rd Charge DAC 926451/2019:

>> … sometime between 2014 and 2015, in the bedroom of Blk XXX XXX XXX #XXX, Singapore XXX (“the Flat”), did use criminal force to one C3, a female, then 11 – 12 years old (D.O.B.: 28 May 2003) to wit, by using your hand to touch her left breast over her clothes, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said C3 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).(“the Penal Code”)

>     1st Charge MAC 906733/2019:

>> … sometime in July 2014 or July 2015, at around midnight, at the master bedroom of (the Flat) did use criminal force to one C1, a female / then 14 – 15 years of age (D.O.B.: 26 May 2000), to wit, by using your hands to grab both her breasts over her clothes, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said C1 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code.

>     2nd Charge MAC 906734/2019:

>> … sometime between 2014 and 2015, in the afternoon, at the master bedroom of (the Flat), did use criminal force to one C2, a female / then 13 – 14 years of age (D.O.B.: 9 August 2001), to wit, by using your hand to touch her breast over her clothes, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said C2 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code.

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

5       The Prosecution’s case is that the Accused had committed outrage of modesty against each of his three step-children whilst they were living in him at the matrimonial flat.

### Background facts

6       The three step-daughters of the Accused are as follows (from the eldest to the youngest:

> (a)     C1 (DOB: 26 May 2000). She was 14-15 years old at the material time of the alleged offence (July 2014 or July 2015);

> (b)     C2 (DOB: 9 August 2001). She was 13-14 years old at the material time of the alleged offence (between 2014 and 2015); and

> (c)     C3 (DOB: 28 May 2003). She was 11-12 years old at the material time of the alleged offence (between 2014 and 2015).

7       The three step-daughters are the children of one M. They were living in Perak, Malaysia. M left them in Malaysia under the care of a nanny when she came to Singapore to work. The biological father was not involved in their lives. M became acquainted with the Accused whilst working as colleagues in Certis Cisco in Singapore in 2012. They developed a relationship and subsequently got married on 28 November 2013.

8       Upon their marriage, M’s three children came to Singapore to live with M and the Accused in the Accused’s HDB flat (“the Flat”). This was in the year 2014. The Accused had renovated the Flat and installed air-conditioning to prepare the Flat for M and her children. The three step-children occupied one bedroom by themselves whilst the Accused and M occupied the master bedroom.

9       In February 2014, the Accused had signed a statutory declaration to accept all the three victims as members of his family. The Accused also assisted to apply for and to obtain permanent residency for M in October 2014 and for his three step-children in October 2018.

### The circumstances leading to the arrest of the Accused

10     On the night of 10 February 2019, the Accused had consumed alcohol whilst waiting for M to return from work. After meeting her at the bus-stop, they then walked home together. M noted that he was not walking stably and knew that he had drunk a lot. She then started quarrelling with the Accused over his drinking. Their quarrelling continued into the Flat and extended into the early hours of the following morning. Due to the loud ruckus caused by the quarrelling, the Police were called by someone presumably in the neighbourhood at about 1.12am on 11 February 2019 with the message “a couple is quarrelling very loudly and the man is banging on the door. Can police help” (see P1 – First Information Report). As a result of the call, Police attended to the incident at the Flat.

11     Upon Police arrival, the Accused initially refused to allow the officers entry into the flat or to provide his NRIC for verification. M spoke to the officers outside the Flat, while the Accused remained near the kitchen area. The police checked with M if she was alright and whether she could spend the night at a relative’s place. M said that would be too troublesome as she needed to work the next day and assured the police that they would not quarrel again. M then mentioned to the police about her daughters being molested in the past and whether if “this incident that happened a few years ago was still valid”[^1]. On hearing this, the officers then interviewed C1 and C3. C2 was not at home when the Police attended to the incident.

12     Following the interviews with C1 and C3, the Accused was placed under arrest for an offence of Outrage of Modesty at 2.09am on 11 February 2019 (P2 – Arrest Report refers) and was brought back to the Woodlands Regional lock-up. Whilst at an interview room at the said lock-up, at about 11.59am on 11 February 2019, Insp Lua Mui Chin Joyce (“IO Lua”) recorded a statement from the Accused. The Accused spoke in a mixture of Mandarin and English and the said statement was handwritten by her (P3). This statement was admitted into evidence after an ancillary hearing was held. In P3, the Accused had admitted to touching the breasts of all three step-daughters.

13     Subsequently, the Accused contacted M to have her bail him out and she proceeded to do so. The Accused returned to the Flat but moved out of the Flat a few days later. He subsequently initiated divorce proceedings.

### The allegation of outrage of modesty – C1 (pertaining to charge MAC 906733/2019)

14     I will start with the eldest step-daughter, C1. She recalled that on or about her mother’s birthday on 12th July, in either 2014 or 2015, the Accused had purchased a cake for her and brought it home after he completed his morning shift, in order to celebrate. As M was working the afternoon shift, she only returned home at about midnight. In 2014, C1 was 14 years old and was in Secondary 1.

15     After M had returned home from working in an afternoon shift, at about midnight, C1 went over to the master bedroom to call the Accused. She noticed that the Accused was kind of drunk as she could smell alcohol coming from him.

16     After reaching the master bedroom and telling the Accused to come out, C1 began walking out when suddenly, the Accused came from behind her and used both of his hands to grab her breasts over her volleyball jersey forcefully.

17     Despite asking the Accused to let go of her, he did not listen to her. She then tried to escape by bending forward but her struggle to release herself from the Accused’s hold was unsuccessful. C1 then shouted to her mother for help. Her mother responded from the kitchen asking her “why”. C1 responded by saying that the Accused had touched her breasts. The Accused immediately let go of her at this juncture. The struggle lasted for a few seconds.

18     Later, upon being asked by her mother if she had said that the Accused had touched her breasts, C1 simply told her that nothing had happened, and elected to keep the matter to herself.

19     C1 felt panicked and disgusted by the action of the Accused. However, she also did not want her mother to worry. She was cognisant of the fact that her mother and the Accused had just married and they might fight over this matter resulting in the children being sent back to Malaysia.

20     The incident made her lose her respect for the Accused and she was determined to earn her own allowance and not rely on the Accused. Hence, when she turned 15, she started part-time work on weekends, firstly as a waitress at Jumbo Seafood and later as a hotel banquet staff. With the job, she also felt that she could stay out of the home for longer periods as she wanted to avoid seeing the Accused[^2].

### The allegation of outrage of modesty – C2 (pertaining to charge MAC 906734/2019)

21     C2 testified that on an occasion when she was in Primary 6, in 2015, she had returned home from school in the afternoon and had gone to the master bedroom to sleep as she could not feel the fan in her bedroom when she lies on the upper deck of the double decker bed. She was lying on her back, facing the ceiling, and was awakened from her sleep when she felt someone touching her. She turned around to find that the Accused was sleeping beside her. She realised that the Accused had used his right hand to squeeze her right breast over her clothes. No one else was present in the room at the time.

22     C2 then got up and left the master bedroom to go back to her room to sleep. She explained that she did not say anything to the Accused as she felt that she was still young at 14 years old and she did not know what to say.

23     She explained that she did not share what had just transpired with any of her family members as she was young and had found the entire ordeal “very revolting”. She was also unsure of how to broach the topic with her mother and feared that she may be blamed for making a false accusation. While C2 remained unsure of whether the Accused had committed this act of molest, her suspicions were confirmed when the Accused continued with other acts of molest subsequently. This was when the Accused would touch her breasts from behind her on a few occasions when he gave her pocket money.

24     After these incidents, C2 explained that she seldom spent time at home and instead became very rebellious and did not communicate much with her family members. She also got involved with bad company and did not attend school. She stayed away from home so she could hang out with her friends as well as to avoid seeing the Accused[^3]. Nonetheless, she would still seek him out to purchase food, and in particular, cigarettes, as her mother disapproved of her smoking and would not buy cigarettes for her[^4].

### The allegation of outrage of modesty – C3 (pertaining to charge MAC 926451/2019)

25     C3 testified that she was a Primary 4 student when she first started studying in Singapore in 2014. She described that she would address the Accused as “Ah Pa” which means father. It took some time for her to get used to living together with the Accused as she was not accustomed to living with a man in the house. Nonetheless, she found that he was nice to her and he was concerned about them and brought them food like what a father would do. However, this impression of the Accused soon changed after he had molested her.

26     On one occasion between 2014 and 2015, in the afternoon, while C3 was lying on her bed and alone in her bedroom, the Accused came and lay beside her. The bedroom door was only partially open at this juncture. She described that she lay on her side, with the left side of her body on the mattress, as she faced the wall. She was using her handphone when she noticed the Accused’s presence behind her. The Accused then placed his hand across her body to grab her left breast and thereafter moved his thumb in an upward and downward motion on her breast, over her clothes.

27     C3 demonstrated the act the Accused had performed in the course of her evidence using a piece of paper. Though she was not able to keep track of how long the touching lasted, she described that it felt long to her and estimated that it would have lasted for about a minute.

28     C3 explained that as she felt nervous and did not know what to do when the Accused committed the above acts, she pretended not to notice his presence and continued using her handphone. She did not tell him to stop as she was scared. She was also worried that as her mother and the Accused just got married, they might split up and her mother would be sad.

29     Following the incident, she kept her distance from the Accused and tried to forget it had occurred. She remained fearful of him and described that the incident was “like a trauma”, as she dreamt of the Accused opening the door on her while she was changing in her room[^5].

### Corroboration of the incident of outrage of modesty involving C1

#### Testimonies from other witnesses in the Flat

30     In relation to the incidents of alleged molest against the three step-daughters, only C1 asserted that she had reacted with a shout of help to her mother whilst C2 and C3 had kept quiet. C1 had said that her mother came to her after that but she told her mother that nothing had happened.[^6]

##### (1)   Testimony of C3

31     This was corroborated by C3. She testified that there was one day when everyone was at home and she was in her room when she heard C1 scream something like, “He touched me”. She said that all of them, including her mother and C2, went forward to C1. She heard C1 informing that the Accused had grabbed her breasts. However, C3 could not remember what their response was after that.[^7]

##### (2)   Testimony of C2

32     C2 testified that she had just been awakened by her mother to have a meal. She had been sleeping on the sofa in the living room. As she was going behind the sofa, she heard C1 shouting “Mummy” very loudly. She noted that her mother was in the kitchen whilst C1 was standing at the doorway of the master bedroom and that the Accused was behind her. She also heard C1 said either “Don’t touch me” or “Why are you touching me?”

33     She then saw her mother going towards C1 to ask her what happened. She heard C1 responded to say “Nothing”. C2 thought C1 did not want to say too much.[^8]

##### (3)   Testimony of M

34     M testified that in relation to this incident, she could only recall that she was in the kitchen when she heard C1 scream “Mummy”. When she asked C1 what had happened, C1 did not say anything.

#### Testimony from C1’s friend

35     C1 testified that she did tell one of her friends about this incident. She gave the name of that friend in court, one MC.

36     MC recounted that she and C1 were from the same Secondary School and was engaged in the same CCA (“Co-curricular Activities”). They became close in the year 2015. However, they quarrelled and their friendship broke up in 2019.

37     Subsequently, she was contacted by the Investigating Officer Liyana (“IO Liyana”) sometime in June 2020 and she was asked about whether she knew anything about this case. Before she was contacted by IO Liyana, she was not aware that there was an ongoing court matter.

38     MC testified sometime in 2015 or 2016, C1 had shared with her that the year before, her stepfather had molested her by touching her on her chest in her parents’ bedroom. She recalled that C1 looked very sad, angry and uncomfortable when she was sharing about this incident. She advised C1 to tell her mother about it and to try to distance herself from her stepfather.

### The discussion of the alleged outrage of modesty incidents amongst themselves

39     All the three children, C1, C2 and C3, had testified that they felt very disgusted by the incidents but at the same time felt very embarrassed to talk about it. They were also worried that the disclosure may jeopardise their mother’s marriage. Hence, they kept it to themselves.

40     However, they did subsequently disclose this matter to one another.

#### Conversation between C2 and C3, which was overheard by their mother

##### (1)   Testimony of C3

41     First, C3 recalled that sometime in the middle of 2017, whilst in her bedroom together with C2, they were talking about their lives when suddenly C2 talked about her being touched by the Accused. C3 was shocked that C2 was also touched. C3 then shared about what had happened to her as well. She could not remember what the mother and sister said after that. She could only recall that her mother was upset on hearing about this from them.[^9]

##### (2)   Testimony of C2

42     C2 stated that sometime in 2017, when she was alone with C3 in their bedroom, they were talking about how the stepfather would touch their leg or thigh when calling them to have their meals. It was at this point that C3 mentioned that the Accused had hugged her from behind and touched her breasts while she was sleeping on her own bed. C2 was shocked to hear that. C2 also shared with C3 about what had happened to her.[^10]

43     They were talking halfway when their mother entered their bedroom and heard part of their conversation about being molested. Hence, C2 told her mother as well. She could not remember as to whether C3 also shared with their mother.

44     C2 recalled that their mother was very angry. They did talk about what to do but were unsure. She also could not remember about what their mother said she would do. She explained that it was a topic she tried to avoid and she wanted to forget something like that as she found it very disgusting.[^11]

##### (3)   Testimony of M

45     M testified that C2 sometime in or before June 2016 was not willing to come home. She thought that it was because C2 was entering a rebellious phase and was mixing around with bad company.

46     However, in 2017, she realised unexpectedly that it was not because of those reasons. She had entered her daughters’ bedroom and had overheard C2 and C3 talking about something that appeared to have been kept from her. She then asked them and they informed her that “Ah Pa touched us”. She began to ask more questions like “where did he touch?”, “what happened?”, “how did it happen?” and “why did you not let me know?”

47     She shared that C3 informed her that the Accused had hugged her and touched her breast while she was lying down on her bed. C3 had described to her the manner of touching the breast as grasping her breast and doing an up and down motion using the thumb on the breast.

48     C2 also shared with her that she was touched on the breast while she was sleeping in M’s room. C2 also told her that the Accused had touched her also when he gave her money.

49     M was upset about what she had heard but she was not able to decide on what to do.[^12]

#### The subsequent discussion on the molest incidents by all three children and their mother

50     Another common part of the Prosecution’s evidence is that all the three daughters and mother did subsequently talk about the incidents of molest against each daughter.

##### (1)   Testimony of C1

51     C1 testified that she first talked about her incident with her sisters and her mother when they were on vacation in Malaysia in December 2017. When their mother asked about what they should do, C1 opined not to mind about it since it has happened some time ago and to just let it go. They also came to the conclusion that as there were no witnesses, it would be hard for anyone to trust them.

52     She remembered her mother was feeling very sad and heart-broken that she could not do anything for them.[^13]

53     C1 further recalled that after the trip to Malaysia, all four of them did discuss again, this time at a prata shop at Ang Mo Kio Hub. They talked again about the Accused molesting them. The outcome of the discussion was similar in that they decided to let the matter rest. C1 had expressed the fear that the Accused might send them back to Malaysia and as the matter had happened quite long ago and there was no evidence, no one might believe them. M had lamented in response as to why they did not disclose these incidents earlier to her. C1 explained to her that she felt shamed and disgusted by what the Accused did and was also afraid that they would fight over this.[^14]

##### (2)   Testimony of C2

54     C2 could only remember that there was a discussion amongst all the three sisters and their mother about the incident but she could not remember what the conversation was about and was not able to provide any details about it.[^15]

##### (3)   Testimony of C3

55     C3 could remember having a conversation with C2 about the incident and her mother joining in that conversation as set out above. However, she could not remember if all three sisters together with their mother had such a conversation.[^16]

##### (4)   Testimony of M

56     M testified that the first time she talked to all the three girls about the molest incidents was at a prata shop at Ang Mo Kio Hub about two weeks after her conversation with C2 and C3 when she had overheard their conversation.

57     C1 recounted to her how the Accused had molested her. C1 then told her to just leave the matter alone and to give the Accused a chance. C2 had no opinion and C3 simply agreed.

58     M felt torn between her daughters on the one hand and the Accused who was her husband, on the other. In the end, the decision was to give the Accused a chance.[^17]

59     M then recalled there was another conversation she had with the three children and this was in 2017 when they went to Malaysia during the end of school year holiday period. It was during this time that the Accused had sent some phone text messages to them, telling C1 not to return home as he will lock the door.

60     M presumed that the Accused must have drunk before sending out those messages. The messages received prompted them to talk about the Accused not changing his ways of drinking and that led to conversation about the molest incidents again about how the Accused had not changed despite being given a chance. When they returned from Malaysia, they did find the door locked. M thought the Accused might have been drinking again. She sent one of his daughters to the coffeeshop downstairs to look for him and found him indeed drinking. She managed to retrieve the keys from him to enter their home.[^18]

### The quarrel on the night leading to the arrest of the Accused

#### The testimony of M

61     M had testified that during the quarrel with the Accused on the night leading to the arrest, the Accused had, amongst other things, complained that the step-daughters did not show respect to him or address him. M had retorted by asking how he would expect the children to respect him or call him “Ah Pa” when he had ‘touched’ their breasts. The Accused denied and further responded by saying C1’s boyfriend could touch her and there was no problem. M then replied that that was because he was the boyfriend but the Accused was the “Ah Pa”.[^19]

#### The testimony of C1

62     This conversation was heard by C1. C1 had testified that she could hear the Accused and M quarrelling outside her bedroom. Only she and C3 were in the bedroom. She heard the Accused and M quarrel about money, as well as about why the children did not call the Accused “Ah Pa”. He also talked about the boyfriends of C2 and C1.

63     When the Accused had complained about why the step-daughters did not address him as father, M had said what he did to them had made them lose their respect for him. When the Accused questioned M to clarify what she had said, M had replied that he had molested them. The Accused then responded by saying, “Now their boyfriends can touch them but I cannot touch them.”

64     The next thing C1 could recollect after that exchange was the Accused banging loudly on her door. C1 quickly locked her door. She only opened it later when her mother came to tell her that the police had arrived.[^20]

#### The testimony of C3

65     C3 said she did not pay attention to the quarrel whilst she was in the bedroom as she was trying to do her homework.

### The Accused’s apology to the family after being bailed out

66     The final significant event was after the Accused was released on bail and returned to the Flat. According to C3, the Accused had apologised to her mother and her but did not specify what he was sorry for.[^21]

67     C1 did not see the Accused after he was released from the police station as she was busy with work. C2 also did not mention meeting the Accused after his release from the police station.

68     M testified that she had gone together with C3 to bail the Accused out. On the way back while they were still out, the Accused apologised to her and C3. He said he would apologise to C1 and C2 when he got home.

69     M testified that when the Accused apologised to the children, he had said “Sorry, Ah Pa does not want to go to jail”. M responded to ask him why he then did such a thing and that he should not drink so much every day. She also asked him to tell his elder sister these things.[^22]

## The Defence

70     The Defence submitted firstly regarding the Accused’s statement P3, that there was reasonable doubt of the accuracy of the recorded statements. Amongst other points, the statement was taken when the Accused was in an inadequate state of mind due to lack of sleep and hangover effect, and he was also intent on getting the statements over and done with. He also mentioned that he trusted the Investigating Officer when she said he would only get a warning.

71     The Defence also contended that the alleged incidents of molest did not happen, and were either embellished or concocted after M had discussed the plan with her daughters in December 2017. The Accused also stated that M, using her influence over her daughters, had come up with these false allegations so as to get the Accused out of the Flat. This was because they had quarrelled over the issue of him refusing to make M a joint owner of the Flat. The Accused highlighted the fact also that the allegations of molest were made against him only after the three children had obtained their Singapore Permanent Residency in October 2018.

72     The Defence highlighted the inconsistences, repeated vagueness, and lack of relevant details in the testimonies of the three girls. The Defence also further highlighted the multiple contradictions in the accounts of M and the three girls, and the bringing up of other alleged incidents of molest by M which the three girls did not even raise in their testimonies.

73     Finally, the Defence adduced evidence of the Accused’s good character and caring attitude towards his family. The Accused’s elder sister, S, and nephew, K, testified that the Accused was a simple, trusting, trustworthy and responsible person and also a dutiful father who did his best to provide for his new family. He had a normal and respectful relationship with his step-daughters. It was thus extremely difficult to conceive that just a few months into his marriage with M, that the Accused would jeopardize his marriage by allegedly molesting his step-daughters.

74     The Accused’s elder sister and nephew also testified that when they accompanied the Accused to report at the police station as a condition of his bail, M had informed them not to worry as the IO had told her it would only be a warning.

## THE COURT’S ANALYSIS

### The burden of proof

75     The burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt in order to secure a conviction. This standard of proof also applies to the ancillary hearing with respect to the issue of voluntariness of the making of the statement P3 (the handwritten version) before it can be admitted into evidence.

76     It is trite law that in trials involving allegations of sexual offences where the complainant is the sole witness of the alleged offence and there are no other evidence, the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt can only be discharged where the complainant is found to be “unusually convincing”.

77     However, in the present case, the complainants of the allegations of outrage of modesty are not the only witnesses as in addition, there is the crucial evidence of the self-incriminatory statement of the Accused, P3. Hence, I will start off the analysis of the evidence on the admissibility of P3 and thereafter the effect of the contents of the statement.

### Ancillary hearing on the issue of voluntariness in the making of P3

78     The recorder of the Accused’s statement, P3, IO Lua, holding the rank of Inspector, was the Investigating Officer of the case at the material time. The Accused chose to speak in Mandarin. IO Lua did not call for an interpreter as she was able to speak in Mandarin. She spoke with the Accused in a mixture of Mandarin and English. She did not encounter any difficulties understanding each other during the recording of the statement.

79     She started recording the statement from the Accused at 11.59am and finished the session at 1.45pm on 11 Feb 2019. The recording took place in an interview room at Woodlands Police Division lock-up. IO Lua explained that she had travelled to Woodlands Police Division from her home without her laptop on that day as the laptop was at her office in the Ang Mo Kio Police Division Headquarters. Hence, she had recorded the Accused’s statement, P3, in her own handwriting. A typewritten version had been subsequently prepared by IO Lua and admitted as P4.

80     It is undisputed that the Accused had signed on P3 and not on P4. However, P4 has been admitted into evidence as the Defence did not challenge or raise any issue of any error in the transcribing from the handwritten text into typewritten form. The Defence Counsel had the opportunity to clarify with IO Lua while she was on the stand pertaining to any part of P4 any words which may not appear to be correctly transcribed but Counsel did not do so.

81     IO Lua explained the process of the recording. She recorded the statement in English in her own handwriting. When it came to the question and answer format, she would read back the answer given by the Accused before moving on to asking the next question and recording the question and answer.

82     At the end of the recording, she read through the statement, paragraph by paragraph in English to the Accused. She would ask if he understood before moving onto the next paragraph. Where there were certain words which he did not understand, she would explain to him by translating some words into Mandarin.

83     Where there are amendments to be made, IO Lua would delete the portion by underlining across it and write the amended words just above the deleted portion. The Accused would then sign next to the amendment[^23].

84     After the statement has been read over to the Accused, the Accused confirmed his statement by signing on every page. The Accused did not raise any complaints or issues with her in the course of the recording. IO Lua stated that there was no threat, inducement or promise given to the Accused in the making of this statement.

85     IO Lua accepted that it was possible that the Accused was not able to decipher her handwriting but she has read over the handwritten statement to him and the Accused understood and signed the statement[^24]. The only issue that IO Lua was confronted with during cross-examination that was relevant to the issue of voluntariness was that she had informed the Accused, “This is your first offence. Don’t worry, you will get a warning.”[^25]

86     IO Lua firmly denied this allegation made against her and that further she did not promise him that he would only get a warning if he signed the statement.

87     It was also put to IO Lua that for the cancellation and addition made to paragraph 2 of P3, the Accused was asked to sign without them being read back to him. IO Lua again firmly denied this allegation[^26].

88     I found that IO Lua had given clear and cogent evidence that the statement had been recorded without any threat, inducement and promise. There was no reason for her to give such an assurance to the Accused in order to get him to give his statement or to sign his statement. The Accused had stated that he trusted her as she is a police officer. There was no evidence that he showed any defiance or non-cooperation. By all accounts, the recording of the statement appeared to have been done smoothly without any difficulty.

89     IO Lua during re-examination when asked if the Accused had any previous offences, had stated she did not do any background screening at that point in time on the Accused. Hence, with a follow up question of whether she had checked with the Accused, she said she did not ask him. However, on being pointed out that in P3, at the end of paragraph 1, the Accused had stated that he did not have any case with the Police before, she conceded that she might have asked the Accused that question and that she had forgotten about this part[^27].

90     I accept that she could have genuinely overlooked this part given the passage of time and the fact that she would have recorded many other statements from accused persons. I did not think she was deliberately lying to cover any inducement to the Accused or that she was trying to distance herself from any knowledge that the Accused had no previous court cases.

91     Furthermore, as rightly pointed out by IO Lua, she is not in a position to provide such an assurance. She was able to explain cogently that as Investigating Officers, at the end of the investigations, their role would be to submit the Investigation Papers to the Attorney-General’s Chambers for a decision to be made and a direction would be given by them[^28].

92     In contrast, the Accused waffled in his evidence as whether the statement was read back to him by IO Lua before he signed it. The first time when he was asked the question, he answered yes[^29]. When he was then asked whether what was read back to him was what he had told IO Lua, he then claimed that although the IO did read back to him his statement, he did not understand what the IO was saying as his mind was a blank due to shock, confusion, hangover and that he had not slept since 3:00am in the lock-up. However, even though he did not know what the IO was saying, he still proceeded to sign the statement because he trusted her as she is a police officer[^30].

93     However, he subsequently changed his position on his understanding of the statement that he was signing. He agreed during cross-examination that he did know that he was facing serious allegations of molesting his three step-children. He then agreed that despite not knowing what was in the statement, he was prepared to sign it. The Prosecution then asked the Accused if he was prepared to admit to doing the acts of molest just because the IO had promised him a warning and he again agreed because he trusted IO Lua.

94     Prosecution then asked a few times and I had to clarify with him on his answer and he confirmed that he although he did not commit the acts and was wrongly accused, he was willing to admit to the acts because he trusted the Investigating Officer[^31].

95     I found the Accused’s position rather contradictory. On the one hand, he claimed that he did not understand what IO Lua was saying when she was reading his statement back to him due to his state of mind. However, on the other hand, he accepted that he knew that the statement was about serious allegations of molest committed by him against his three step-daughters and he was prepared to admit to them because of his implicit trust in IO Lua’s assurance that he would only be given a warning.

96     In my view, the Accused therefore clearly knew what the contents were of the statement when he signed on it. His position that he did not understand what IO Lua was saying when she was reading out the statement had been implicitly contradicted by himself and was therefore untenable.

97     I am reinforced in my belief that the Accused clearly understood the contents of his statement by his subsequent answers on his understanding of the statement. When it was put to him by the Prosecution that the answers to the questions posed by the IO came from the Accused, the Accused initially replied “No, disagree”. However, he then in the same breath said that most of the time the IO was speaking, which did not quite flow from his answer. When he was asked again about whether the contents and the answers to the questions in the statement came from him and him alone and the Accused answered yes and agreed with that[^32]. This was the first clear admission that the answers in the statement came from him.

98     Given the Accused’s response of agreeing that the answers in the statement came from him, Defence Counsel during re-examination then tried to ask the Accused to clarify his answer and if he understood the question. I will reproduce this part in full:

> Q:    …earlier, the Prosecutor first asked you if the contents of the handwritten statements all came from you, your answer was, “No. Disagree. Most of the time it’s the IO talked.” Shortly after this His Honour asked you whet---whether the contents all came from you then you said, “Yes.” Can you explain your understanding of the word “content”?

> A:    Uh---uh, Your Honour, content means, uh, what is happening.

99     The Defence Counsel then tried to explain to him the meaning of “contents” as “what is inside the handwritten statement, what is written there”. She again asked the Accused to therefore explain his earlier answer when he agreed that the contents of the statement came from him and his response was as follows:

> Q:    What did you try to answer just now?

> A:    I’m trying to tell Your Honour is that I trust the IO that she speak behalf of –as a police officer, so I take it that trust.[^33]

100    As the above answer clearly did not clarify his position as to whether the answers as recorded by the IO in the statement came from him, I had to clarify once again with him, he again answered “Yes” for the second time. He then said he wished to explain his answer. The series of questions and his answers are set out here:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

But now you also have been given a typewritten version?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. So---so, do you agree that the typewritten answers now which you can read, right, the answers to those questions did it (sic) come from you?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

It (sic) came from you?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes, ye---yes, Your Honour. But I need to ex---explain.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. Sure. You---just make---get your answer first.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Because---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Did---let me ge---get the---type down your answer first. Just hold on first. Okay. Yes, what’s your explanation?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Because this---all this was happened on 2014 and I really I can’t recall this thing, it is happened. So, when the IO said this is my first offence I’m, uh, get warning. So, I don’t want to drag the---the statement too long again, you know. And I trust her, the IO. At one time, at not eve---even one---not even one time, my mind can’t recall these things happening. I’m wrongly ac---accused.[^34]

 |

  
  

101    The Accused thus once again confirmed that whilst he maintained he had been wrongly accused, he accepted that the answers recorded in the statement came from him. He again resorted to explaining his statement on the basis that he trusted the IO and he did not want to drag on the matter further.

102    The Defence Counsel then made one final attempt to try to get his client to clear up any misunderstanding by telling him that the Court’s question was directed at the typewritten statement and not the handwritten statement. The Accused latched on to this and said he was confused and thought he was being asked about the handwritten statement.

103    I then once again gave the Accused a chance to confirm once again his answer to this question being asked by his Counsel as to whether the answers in the typewritten version came from him. After reading the typewritten statement in court, the Accused confirmed for the third time that his answer still remained as “Yes”[^35].

104    It was clear to me that the Accused was trying to achieve 2 things at the same time. First, he tried to distance himself from the contents of the statement by saying that he did not understand what the IO was saying to him. Secondly, he had nonetheless taken the positon that whilst he had been falsely accused and he did not admit to the truth of the allegations of molest against him, he agreed he did give a self-incriminatory statement to IO Lua as he had trusted her word as a police officer that he would only be given a warning. These two positions are contrary to each other and irreconcilable.

105    Finally, I found that his position that he had docilely signed trusting in IO Lua that she is a police officer contrary to his earlier stance at his home where he had refused entry to the police into the Flat as he felt they had no right to come in. He also was acting defiantly by refusing to provide his NRIC when requested by the police. He was clearly acting very assertively and was not cowed by the sight of police officers.

106    I found therefore that the burden of proof of beyond a reasonable doubt had been discharged by prosecution that the statement was made without any threat, inducement or promise.

107    The Accused had merely made a bare allegation that such an assurance was given by IO Lua. I found it hard to believe that the Accused would have readily given a self-incriminatory statement just based on the assurance by the IO that only a warning will be given. By his own admission, he understood that the contents of the statement contained allegations of outrage of modesty against him committed on his three stepdaughters. It beggars belief that the Accused would be prepared to sign such a statement based simply on an assurance by the IO that he would be given a warning, knowing full well that he could be charged and serious consequences would follow.

108    The Accused also did not raise this allegation of an inducement to him in his subsequent cautioned statements when he was informed that he would be charged. If indeed such an assurance was given to him which had caused him to falsely incriminate himself, he would naturally have raised this in his cautioned statements.

109    The Defence Counsel tried to make much of the fact that IO Lua ought to have recorded a typewritten version as the Accused was not able to read the handwritten statement. This argument is clearly not relevant to the issue of voluntariness of the statement. In any case, the Accused accepted that the statement was in fact read out to him and he had signed it. He further confirmed in court that the answers in the typewritten version came from him. Defence had also implicitly accepted that the typewritten version was correctly transcribed from the handwritten version. I also accepted the explanation given by IO Lua that she had handwritten the statement as she did not travel from her office where her laptop was kept.

110    I accordingly admitted both the handwritten and typewritten statements of the Accused. I will next go into the contents of the statements and the weight to be given to them.

### The weight to be given to the Accused’s statement P3

111    Once a statement is admitted, the next issue is the weight to be given to them. On this issue, the Defence has raised 2 points. One is that the Accused was not in the right frame of mind, as he was experiencing a hangover and had also been lacking in sleep. The Accused also claimed he was in shock and confusion over the fact that his family have accused him falsely.

112    This can be addressed quite easily. I found no merit in this as the Accused did not inform IO Lua of any discomfort he was experiencing. IO Lua also herself did not observe anything untoward which would cause her to think that the Accused was not in a position to make any statement. Furthermore, IO Lua was able to able to conduct the statement recording without much difficulty and was able to elicit relevant information from the Accused. The Accused’s responses to her questions were logical and relevant showing that he had sufficient cognitive capacity to understand IO Lua’s questions. He was also able to apply his mind during IO Lua’s reading of the statement by asking to make amendment to paragraph 2 at line 8.

113    IO Lua had initially written out the second sentence at paragraph 2 as –

>     I recalled back then, I had about 1 year after my marriage, was at home with the girls and had tapped them to call them to eat or do household chores at the house but about me groping the chest of the girls at home, **I did not do so. However, I had do not deny that I had touched them at their chest when we were in contact with one another.**[^36]

114    Upon reading this line, pursuant to the Accused’s request, IO Lua had deleted the underlined portion and replace it with the following:[^37]

>     I clarify that I had indeed groped their breast from behind to feel over their clothes once. Only one time I am sure. That was only on \[C1\].

115    I found this amendment to clarify that the groping of the breast from behind was only done one time and it was on C1 made sense as it gelled with the rest of the statement. This was because for the rest of the statement, the Accused made a distinction in the manner in which he had molested C1 in comparison with C2 and C3.

116    I will now set out the rest of the statements that made clear this distinction:

>      On C1

>     Paragraph 3, 1st line: On the touch of the three girls chest, it was a grope from behind the body onto the chest to get a feel of it on C1.

>   
| 

Q1:

 | 

It was alleged that you had sometimes in 2014 July, when C1, female 19 years came to your bedroom to eat at midnight, you had come from her behind and grabbed both her breasts and squeeze over her clothes with your hands for a few seconds, did you?

 |
| 

A1:

 | 

I will say that I did that one time to my girls. That was a foolish act when I think of it now as I recalled back then, I just want to get a feel of it, so, I did it. It was a fast grope over the clothes and after it, I never repeat it onto C1 anymore. I am sorry for what I’ve done.

 |

  
  

>      On C3

>   
| 

Q3:

 | 

Apart from C1, you had been alleged to have groped the chest of C3, F/16 year on her left breast over her clothes with your hand in end of 2014 or 2015, did you?

 |
| 

A3:

 | 

On this, I will say that I had come into the girls’ bedroom to call her and when I called her, I recalled she was sleeping sideway, so when I called her, my hand slide downwards thereby causing my hand to glide onto her breasts. I am sorry for that. That was the only time I did that.

 |
| 

Q4:

 | 

Can I confirm that you only touched C3 once on her chest once and not groped her breasts from behind her body like what you did to C1?

 |
| 

A4:

 | 

Yes, that’s right.

 |

  
  

>      On C2

>   
| 

Q7:

 | 

Can I clarify that on the acts of touch, did you do it on your 2nd daughter C2?

 |
| 

A7:

 | 

I think could be at the side of breast as what I did to C3.

 |

  
  

>      On C2 and C3

>   
| 

Q8:

 | 

In this regard, can you tell me why the reason to touch them at the shoulders and letting your hand to slide onto their breasts. Do you have any intention to molest both C3 and C2 then?

 |
| 

A8:

 | 

Paused and said ‘Yes’. It was to get a feel of it frankly.

 |

  
  

>      On C1 vs C2 and C3

>   
| 

Q10:

 | 

This said, can I confirmed you only groped the breasts of C1 once from behind her body and not on C3 and C2?

 |
| 

A10:

 | 

Ya.

 |

  
  

117    From the above, it is clear therefore the amendment was a conscious decision on the part of the Accused that he wished to clarify that the groping manner of molest on the breast from behind only occurred on C1. This clearly showed that the Accused was very alert about his account given to the IO on the three different incidents. He had differentiated the manner of the acts of outrage of modesty on C1 from his other two stepdaughters.

118    I therefore found that the Accused had clearly retained his cognitive capacity and was able to consciously respond to IO Lua’s questions and was not impaired by lack of sleep or hangover. The precise distinction made in the manner in which outrage of modesty was committed also reinforced further my belief that the contents of the statement had come from the Accused rather than something which has been concocted by IO Lua.

119    The second challenge was on the accuracy of the recording and this came rather belatedly. At the ancillary hearing, the Accused had on three occasions confirmed that the answers as recorded in the statement and transcribed to P4 came from him. After the statements had been admitted on conclusion of the ancillary hearing, whilst IO Lua was on the stand, the Defence did not put to her that the statement had been inaccurately recorded from the Accused or that she had fabricated his statement.

120    However, after the defence was called and when the Accused was on the stand, he then asserted that he did not make those self-incriminating statements to IO Lua. He said that he did not admit committing the acts of molest on the three stepchildren during the statement recording.

121    When the Defence Counsel went through his statement, the Accused practically denied stating anything that amounted to an admission of molest. In relation to C1, where it has been recorded by the IO at paragraph 2 of the statement, that the Accused had stated, “Only one time I am sure. That was on C1”, the Accused claimed that what he said to IO Lua was “I’m not even one time. Even on C1”.[^38]

122    Similarly, when the Accused was referred to the next line in the same paragraph 2, “So, I had touched the chest of my three girls. Chest, only one time each”, the Accused claimed that his words to the IO were instead, “No, not even one time on the chest.”

123    I found that the Accused was clearly very contrived and disingenuous in his attempt to try to explain away how the IO could have wrongly recorded his words. I find it hard to believe that the IO could have either inadvertently misheard his words or deliberately twisted his words to turn from a denial of “not even one time” to “one time”.

124    When it came to the Q and A section of the statement, the Accused was clearly floundering in his evidence and came across as totally unsure as to whether he should deny or admit that those questions were asked of him by IO Lua. I will just highlight the direct questions posed by IO Lua as set out in P4.

125    In Q1 in relation to C1, the stated question was –

>     It was alleged that you had sometime in 2014 July, when C1, female 19 years old came to your bedroom to eat at midnight, you had come from her behind and grabbed both her breasts and squeeze over her clothes for a few seconds, did you?

The Accused’s response was no, the IO did not ask this question. This would be rather surprising given that this was the whole purport of the statement recording which was to obtain the Accused’s response to the allegations made by each stepdaughter.

126    Q3 sets out the question in relation to the allegation of molest on C3:

>     Apart from C1, you have been alleged to have groped the chest of C3, F/16 years on her left breast over her clothes with your hand in end 2014 or 2015, did you?”

The Accused’s response to whether the IO had asked was initially, no. When he was asked this question again, his answer became “I can’t recall”.

127    Q4 was a follow up question from the Accused’s alleged response to Q3, where he had admitted to touching C3 by sliding his hand downwards and causing his hand to glide onto her breasts. Q4 was intended for him to confirm that he “only touched C3 on her chest once and not groped her breasts from behind her body like what \[he\] did to C1”. The Accused’s response to whether Question 4 was asked was, “Yes”. The Accused was then asked what his response was to Q4 and he said, “Yes, that’s right, I did not do it”[^39], instead of what was recorded in the statement: “Yes, that’s right”.

128    I found the Accused’s evidence to be clearly contrived. On one hand he agreed his answer was correctly recorded as “Yes, that’s right”, which would be an admission to having touched the chest of C3, but in the same breath, the Accused added the words, “I did not do it” to his alleged response to IO Lua which would turn an admission into a denial.

129    If a question posed was whether he did something and his response was to deny committing the act, he would have naturally said “No, I did not do so”. Instead, he came up with a confusing answer of yes and no at the same time. I found the Accused’s alleged answer incongruent with the question and that he was obviously trying to tailor his answer to suit the recorded answer without incriminating himself.

130    Finally, to whether IO had asked the direct question in relation to C2, Q7: “Can I clarify that on the acts of touch, did you do it on your 2nd daughter, C2?”, the Accused’s response was finally a clear “Yes” confirming that the IO had asked him this question.

131    Having agreed that he was asked this question by the IO, the Accused had to respond to the next question which was whether he had answered this question in the manner as was recorded in P4.

132    The recorded answer was “I think could be at the side of breast as what I did to C3”.

133    The Accused’s confusing answer was “I did not do it on the side of the breast for what I did to C3. What I did to C3, uh, I said something like, uh, I think I did not do it”[^40]. The Accused whilst denying he did the act on C2, seemed to be also saying that he had committed touching the side of C3’s breast.

134    Even his own Defence Counsel was a bit dumbfounded by his response when she told him, “ Your answer is a bit confusing. What did you say to the IO?” to which the Accused answered in a slightly clearer way but still stuttering away, “I did not do it at the --I did not do it at the ---to 2nd daughter C2, uh, I said something like, uh, I think I did not do it.”[^41]

135    The Accused clearly came across as trying desperately and clumsily to untangle himself from the incriminatory parts of his statement.

136    I will just highlight one last part of his response to his statement that really amplified his ambivalent state of mind as to whether to admit that his statement has been accurately recorded.

137    A12 was his response to the last question asked as recorded in the statement. The Accused was asked if he had anything to add before the IO ended the recording of the statement. His stated response was, “I will like to apologize to the girls and will ensure I not do such a thing on them again. Anything will be thru my wife. I will also cut down on my drinking habit as I was feeling stressed with my financial strains too”.

138    Coming in the background of his earlier admissions, the apology to the girls would be clearly understood as the Accused expressing his remorse to his stepdaughters for the wrong he had committed on them.

139    However, instead of a flat denial that he had made such a statement to the IO about wanting to apologise to his children which would have been an implied admission to having committed the offences, the Accused tried to give a different spin to what the apology was about.

140    He admitted to saying, “I apologise to the girls and to my wife, to cut down on my drinking habits as I’m feeling stressed with my financial strains”. His Defence Counsel then asked him why he was apologising to his girls and his response was that he was apologising to them for accusing him of molesting them.

141    He then gave a series of bizarre answers in trying to explain why he was apologising to them. He claimed he was feeling angry and disappointed that they would accuse him when he had treated them so well.

142    When pressed further as to why this would cause him to apologise to them, he then said that he apologised to them because “this house is broken now. My family is broken”[^42].

143    This is clearly another example of the Accused trying to wriggle his way out but, in the process, came up with illogical explanations for his recorded answers. If the Accused felt he had been wrongly accused and this false accusation had caused his family to be broken, it would be totally inexplicable for him to be telling the IO that he would be apologising to his stepdaughters.

144    It would also be totally at odd with his position that his wife had falsely accused him to get him out of the house for him to then apologise to her and to make amends by cutting down his drinking habits. The only explicable reason for him informing the police that he wished to apologise to his step-daughters and his wife is that he really did commit the acts of molest on his stepchildren as alleged by them and he was expressing his regret for having done so in the hope that he will be forgiven and shown some leniency.

145    On the whole, I found the Accused’s credit with regard to his evidence on the contents of the statement totally impeached and that full weight can be given to his admissions.

146    It is settled law that a conviction may be grounded on an accused’s confession alone, even if that statement is subsequently retracted, so long as the court is satisfied that the confession was voluntary, true and reliable: _Lim Thian Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 319</span> at \[43\]. Once the above is fulfilled, no other corroborative evidence of the confession is required. In the present case, I have found that the confession of the Accused is voluntary, true and reliable. In addition, there was strong corroborative evidence coming from the evidence of C1-C3 and M. The Accused himself also had implicitly admitted to the truth of his confessions by his conduct after his arrest as shall be elaborated later.

### The creditworthiness of C1, C2 and C3

147    I will now go on to give my analysis on the evidence of the three principal witnesses on the allegations of outrage of modesty. In assessing the credibility of a witness, the approach in _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ \[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 59272 at \[9\] is instructive. The trial judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following:

> (a)     demeanour of the witness;

> (b)     the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of the witness’ evidence; and

> (c)     the external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of the witness’ evidence and the extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

148    It bears emphasising that the step-daughters’ evidence in the case is not required to meet the “unusually convincing” standard given that the victims’ evidence does not form the sole basis of the conviction in view of the confession contained in the statement of the Accused which has been admitted.

149    My general assessment of the three sisters are that they have been able to give a cogent and forthright account of the alleged molest on them. Their evidence was both internally and externally consistent. They kept to their evidence despite a rigorous cross-examination by the Defence Counsel.

150    All three of them were able to describe what had happened to them and how shocked they were when the incident happened. I found that they did not try to exaggerate the account. Their evidence is that the Accused’s act of molest was over their clothes and did not last long. Both C1 and C3 also stated that the touching of their breasts only happened once. Only C2 alleged that over and above the incident which happened while she was sleeping, there were further occasions for which the Accused did touch her breast when giving her pocket money. I will come back to this allegation by C2 later.

151    C1 was able to pinpoint the event as related to the celebration of her mother’s birthday. The Accused had bought a birthday cake for her mother. They had to wait until her mother returned home from the evening shift. It was late at night when she went in to call the Accused from his bedroom to come out to celebrate the event. Hence, she was able to link the incident of molest to the celebration of her mother’s birthday.

152    C2 could recall that she had gone to lie down in her parents’ bedroom as the wind from the fan did not reach her upper deck in her own bedroom whereas there was a fan in her parents’ bedroom. She was sleeping but woke up when she felt the Accused molesting her. As she was still feeling tired after waking up from her sleep, she did not say anything and went back to her bedroom to continue to sleep. She also explained her fear of saying the wrong thing about the incident and thereby making a false accusation against the Accused. She only became sure of what the Accused did on that day when the Accused repeated his act of molest by touching her breast from behind her on a few occasions when giving her pocket money.

153    C3 gave a clear account of her lying down and looking at her phone when she felt the Accused touching her breast and using his thumb to stroke her breast in an up and down manner. She was too scared to react and pretended to continue looking at her handphone. After a while, the Accused got up and left the room. She felt it was revolting and she was too embarrassed to talk about it then.

154    All three incidents happened quite early in the marriage of the Accused with M. It happened between the first and second year into the marriage and they have all just come over to Singapore to start a new life in this new family. Hence, I found their explanation convincing about why they elected to keep silent initially which was out of concern as to what will happen to the their mother’s marriage. The possibility that they could be sent back to Malaysia after the breakdown of their mother’s marriage was a very real prospect for them and that would have easily caused them to keep mum about the incident. It also bore emphasising that all the three of them were of relatively young age at the material time, ranging from 11 to 15 years old and would thus be more fearful and unsure as to what they should do.

155    All three of them were also fair in their evidence in respect of how well they were treated by the Accused in all aspects other than the acts of molest. They agreed that the Accused took care of them by providing them pocket money and buying food for them at times. C2 in particular also admitted that the Accused was the person who would help her to buy cigarettes and had bailed her out when she got into trouble with the law. They also accepted that the Accused had put in effort to obtain Singapore permanent residency for them.

156    However, it is also clear and largely unchallenged by the Accused that at some point, they had grown distant from the Accused and C1 and C2 had minimised their time with him by staying out of the home more often. The Accused admitted to the strain in their relationship as he had testified that he had quarrelled with M over the issue of the children not showing respect to him, amongst other complaints. This strain in their relationship is consistent with the evidence of the three stepchildren.

157    More crucially, all their allegations that they had been touched on the breasts had been corroborated by the Accused’s admission in his statement.

158    Additionally, C1’s evidence that she had informed her friend MC that she had been molested by her stepfather, was corroborated by MC’s testimony that C1 had disclosed this information to her in 2015 or 2016. MC was able to recount a version that is consistent with the evidence given by C1, which was that she was touched on the chest whilst in her parents’ bedroom. MC also testified that her friendship had broken up with C1 in 2019 and was not aware of any ongoing trial until the IO Liyana contacted in 2020[^43]. She clearly did not have any axe to grind against the Accused and I accepted that there was no collusion between her and C1 to come up with this story of an earlier disclosure in 2015 or 2016.

159    I also found all the testimony of C1-C3 and M on the fact that after talking about the incident in 2017, they had decided to let the matter rest consistent with the account of the Accused as well as in how the matter came to be reported.

160    Firstly, the Accused confirmed that the allegation of molesting the step-children hurled at him by M did not just happen on the night of the quarrel when he was arrested. He had testified that M would bring this up every time they quarrelled. He then confirmed that this allegation started in 2018 around the time when the stepchildren obtained their permanent residency[^44].

161    This confirmed M’s testimony that although she came to know about the allegations of molest from her children in 2017, they had all decided to let the matter rest since the incidents had happened more than 2 years ago. M only brought this matter up in the heat of the moment during her quarrels with the Accused in 2018. She only disclosed this to the police after the police had attended to a police call by a neighbour over the disturbance caused by their loud quarrelling in February 2019.

162    The random manner in which the police report was made in my view is a strong indication that there was no collusion on the part of M with her children to come up with a false allegation of molest against the Accused for the purpose of getting the Accused out of the house or to get a share of the Flat or to obtain a divorce. If it was so motivated, M and her children would have planned together and initiated the making of a police report on their own and not wait for an unplanned visit by the police to the Flat on the said night.

163    This reluctance to report the Accused and the willingness to let the past remain in the past was also indicated in C2’s police statement recorded on 18 February 2019 (exhibit D2) that was used to impeach her credit by the Defence. C2 had stated at paragraph 5, “I will say that I will not want to testify against my step-father in court as he had no matter what, cared for us and treated us like his own daughters, even when he had no money, he will still buy us dinner and things we want…… I know he likes to drink and when he drank, he will talk louder but will never lay hands on us or mother too. We are thus prepared to let the matter rest and give him another chance”.

### Challenges to credibility of C1-C3 as raised by Defence

#### The credibility of C1’s evidence

164    I will now deal in details the challenges on their credibility as raised by the Defence. First was in relation to the evidence of C1 who had stated that she had shouted where she was molested by the Accused as she was coming out the master bedroom after calling the Accused to come out.

165    There were some minor discrepancies over exactly what the actual words used by C1 were when she shouted whilst struggling to break free from the Accused’s hold. The Defence highlighted several discrepancies.

166    Firstly, C1 said she shouted Mummy and that the Accused “touched her boobs”. C2 heard it as “Don’t touch me” or “Why are you touching me?” whilst C3 heard “He touched me”. M merely heard C1 screaming “Mummy”.

167    The next discrepancy is the reaction to her shout. C1 had stated that M had come to her and asked her “Did you say that the Accused touched your boobs?” to which she had replied that nothing happened, whilst M said she just responded by asking C1 what had happened but C1 did not say anything. C2’s recollection was similar to M’s in that she heard M asked C1 what had happened and C1 had merely said, “Nothing”. C3 on the other hand said that when all three of them went towards C1, C1 had said that the Accused had grabbed her breast and it was very disgusting.

168    There were also discrepancies as to whether they checked on C1 in the living room or in the kitchen.

169    It is quite explicable why every witness would have remembered the account of C1 screaming and the reaction thereafter differently given different levels of memory retention and the time lapse of over 5 years from the time of the incident and the trial. It must also be borne in mind that the incident happened very quickly with a shout and the matter died down just as quickly when C1 said it was noting. In fact, it would be strange and smack of collusion if all the witnesses were able to give exactly the same evidence.

170    I therefore did not find it surprising that each of them was not able to give the exact words spoken by C1 when she screamed. I also find it unsurprising that their accounts would differ in detail as to whether M had heard the allegation made by C1 about being molested by the Accused. C1 recalled that when M had clarified with her, she said it was nothing whilst M said she had merely asked what happened. At the end of the day C1 had said it was nothing. Even if M did hear something about someone touching her breast, she would easily have let it go as her having misheard when C1 said it was nothing and over time, might easily have forgotten about it.

171    I also did not find it unusual that the witnesses were not in agreement on the location of where they were when they responded to C1’s scream, whether it was in the living room or in the kitchen, given that the locations of these 2 places were just next to each other and not a very significant part of the event.

172    What was materially consistent was that all of them heard C1 shouting but when M asked her what had happened, C1 chose to keep silent and said it was nothing.

173    The only glaring discrepancy was C3’s account that C1 had given details of the molest when all the other three witnesses have said that C1 said it was nothing. I am prepared to accept that C3’s memory could have been less accurate given the lapse of time and more importantly that they have all talked about the incident subsequently in 2017. It would not be surprising that some of the things discussed could have caused a distortion to her memory of the incident. I accept that C1 had chosen to remain silent about it when her mother asked her what her scream was about and that C3 was mistaken in her recollection of what C1 had said in response at the material time.

#### The credibility of C2’s evidence

174    I move on to another criticism raised by Defence. This is concerning C2’s failure to mention this allegation of further acts of molest by the Accused in her statements to the police. C2 had given 2 statements to the police. One was D2 recorded on 18 February 2019. Another was given on 30 April 2019[^45]. In D2, at paragraph 6, C2 had stated specifically that “was the only time he did such a thing to me” after talking about the incident of molest on her while she was sleeping in the master bedroom.

175    When she was confronted with this contradiction with her evidence in court where she had said that there were further touching of her breasts when the Accused gave her pocket money, C2 had explained that as her mother had suddenly informed the police, she was caught mentally unprepared to piece everything together and hence did not say everything to the police. She also stated that when the event happened, she was still young and by the time she gave the statement to the police, there was already a lapse of a few years . She thus disagreed that she had lied but rather she had not been able to remember the additional incidents.

176    C2 further explained that after giving her statements to the police in February 2019 and another time in April 2019, it was only later when her mother informed her that she would be required to testify in court that she tried very hard to recollect all the things that had happened to her[^46].

177    C2 was quite candid that she was not quite sure whether the Accused had really molested her in his bedroom. She had just woken up to feel the hand of the Accused on her breast. She then got out of the bed and went back to her bedroom to continue with her sleep. She only confirmed her suspicion about that incident when the Accused touched her breast again subsequently upon giving her pocket money the following year when she was in Secondary One.

178    In my view, C2 could have easily stuck to her earlier version given to the police that there was only one incident which was the molest on her while she was asleep in the master bedroom. There was no need to paint the first incident as something she was unsure of until her suspicions were confirmed by further acts of molest committed on her by the Accused.

179    However, on the other hand, it is a big strange for her to remember only the first incident when reporting the act of molest of the Accused. This is because if her suspicion of the first act of molest was only confirmed by subsequent acts of molest of the Accused committed on her, she ought to have a better memory of the subsequent acts. After all, these subsequent acts were allegedly committed on her while she was fully awake when she received pocket money from the Accused. Yet, she had omitted to mention these subsequent events when she had 2 opportunities to do so in her 2 police statements.

180    This omission would have ordinarily given rise to a reasonable doubt in her evidence or cause her to be less than “unusually convincing”. However, as emphasised earlier, her evidence on the first act of molest has been corroborated by the Accused’s admission in his statement. I therefore found that her evidence on this first act of molest has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

181    For completeness, I also noted that this touching of her breast during the giving of pocket money was actually alluded to on two instances by M. M had firstly recollected that C2 had revealed this to her on the day she had overheard her conversation with C3 about the molest incidents. She said that C2 had informed that in addition to the molest on her while she was sleeping in the master bedroom, the Accused had also “touched” her when giving her money[^47].

182    The second instance was in the WhatsApp message she had sent to the Accused’s elder sister, S. This is exhibit D3 tendered by Defence during the cross-examination of M. The message was sent on 26 February 2019. M had stated the following at page 2 of the English transcript

>     “Don’t mention that you find it hard to believe, an even I find it hard to believe that the guy shares the same bed with me my husband will do such a thing. However, this is an irrefutable fact that cannot be changed. It’s hard to even speak out such things that he did, do you know? All my 3 daughters have been mistreated by him! It happened more than once, many times, you know?! **The most pitiful is my second daughter, who was touched by him every time she took money from him!** What does he think of my daughters? Did he regard me as his wife? In fact, he knew very well what he had done.” (my emphasis)

183    M explained that she had met S and the Accused’s nephew K at the police station in the first month after she had bailed the Accused out. During this encounter, they had given her the impression that she was trying to frame the Accused and also blaming her for reporting the matter to the police. Hence, she felt she needed to explain the situation to S and to tell her about what had happened.

184    Hence as early as 26 February 2019, M had already disclosed such an allegation of molest during giving of money to C2. Hence, if there was any collusion with C2, then M could have easily instructed C2 to mention this in her statement to the police either on 18 February 2019 during the recording of D2 or at the very latest on 30 April 2019 in her second police statement.

185    I will now address another inconsistency highlighted by the Defence in respect of her statement D2 where she had stated that she did not witness the incident of molest on C1. In court, C2 was consistent that she did not witness the Accused touching C1’s breast. However, she did say in court that she saw that the Accused was standing behind C1 when she turned to look after C1 had shouted. The Defence had put it to her that she was lying in court as this piece of information was not in her statement.

186    C2 disagreed that she was lying. She said that she only stated in her statement she did not witness the act because at the time of the recording she did not remember about seeing her stepfather standing behind C1 at the material time[^48].

187    I found this explanation believable given that the incident had happened quite a while ago and she was consistent in that she did not witness the touching of C1’s breast by the Accused. The fact that she had seen the Accused standing behind C1 at the material time might not have been so significant to C2 at the time of the giving of the statement and would not have been foremost in her mind. I therefore did not find this omission to have cast any significant doubt on her credibility.

188    Finally, although C2 was not challenged on her evidence that she had gone to sleep in the master bedroom because there was a fan there and the fan in her bedroom was not effective for her as she was sleeping on the upper deck, the Accused in his evidence belatedly attacked her evidence on the ground that there was an air conditioner in her bedroom and thus there was no reason for C2 to be lying on his bed[^49]. I did not give weight to this challenge because C2 was never given a chance to respond to this assertion that she could have easily used the air conditioner in her room if she was feeling warm that afternoon. The Court was thus deprived of a chance to hear her response. She could very well have given a very cogent explanation as to why she would not make use of the air conditioner and instead resort to using the fan in the master bedroom. This principle of regarding the witness’s evidence as unchallenged is known as the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 (“_Browne_”).

#### The credibility of C3’s evidence

189    The Defence finally also attacked the credibility of C3 in that she was not able to give a lot of details about the incident and was very unclear about the manner of touching of her breast. The Defence also found the claim that C3 could continue using her handphone without flinching or any resistance despite being touched on a sensitive part of the body unbelievable.

190    I found the hesitating manner in which C3 had described the act of the Accused, firstly saying it was a “scratch” then changed it “grab” and later demonstrating it by her and down movement of her thumb, unsurprising. I could see that she was trying her best to describe an embarrassing moment in her life which episode had taken place about 5 years ago. I also found her explanation of her pretending to carry on using her phone without any resistance perfectly understandable and consistent with the fear and shock of a young child confronted with such a situation involving her new stepfather.

### The Defence’s criticism of the credibility of M

191    The Defence had alleged that M had embellished her evidence and had plotted with the children to get the Accused out of the house and also because she coveted a share in his property. The embellishment was evidenced by her allegation that she had seen the Accused kissing C2 on the lips but this was never raised by C2. M had also alleged that she had seen Accused touching C3 on her thigh and hugging her inappropriately over her chest. This evidence came out when M was cross-examined on her Whatsapp conversation with the Accused’s elder sister, one S, and she was asked what she had meant by her words, “In fact, he knew very well what he had done. I have seen his deeds myself many times and I even yelled at him”[^50].

192    I accepted that M’s relationship with the Accused was clearly strained by frequent quarrels between the couple. M had also readily admitted that one of the issues between them was the Accused’s refusal to make her a joint owner of the Flat and that the Accused had threatened to chase her and the three children out of the house during the last quarrel.

193    However, I found that these facts do not provide a strong motive to instigate her children to trump up false allegations of molest against the Accused. First, the link between making such allegations of molest and the supposed goal of a share of the property is quite tenuous. Making false allegation of outrage of modesty could get the Accused into trouble with the law but will not have any impact on her getting a share of his property. It would probably ruin her marriage with the Accused causing a divorce but that would end up with a lot of uncertainty as to her future and did not provide any guarantee over whether she would have any share or an increased share of the Flat. According to M, it was the Accused who initiated divorce proceedings. This evidence was not challenged by the Accused[^51]. M did not take any steps to advance her position in securing the Flat or a share in the flat after the police entered the scene. In fact, after the Accused had left the Flat, she had lamented to the Accused’s sister in her WhatsApp conversation about whether the Accused was going to stay out and ignore her until the case was over. I set out the excerpt of her message here:[^52]

>     I know you will protect him, and tell him not to go home, fearing that we may quarrel again, and ask him to wait until the case is over. If it takes several months, does it mean that he will not come back home for several months? How about me? Is it that as far as the case is not over, he will ignore me and not call me? Was it you or he who wanted us to separate?

194    Furthermore, it was not the first time that the Accused had made such a threat about evicting M and the children and he had never taken any action on it. According to M, the Accused would say “This is my house” each time they quarrelled but he would not carry out his threat to ask them to move out. Hence M was not afraid that the Accused would drive them out of the house on the night of the quarrel[^53]. At the end of the day, M had never taken the initiative to make a police report. The police had come to the Flat in response to a complaint by a neighbour and it was during the interview that she had asked the police about past acts of molest that this matter then took on a more serious development. M herself did not contemplate that the Accused would be arrested[^54].

195    As for her embellishments, these were matters not brought up in her evidence in chief but instead was something that the Defence adduced through asking M about what she had meant in her WhatsApp conversation with S. I therefore found that this was not something cooked up by her to strengthen her false accusation in court. She had maintained that she had not witnessed any of the more serious acts of molest which had been alleged by her daughters to have been committed by the Accused and what she witnessed were less serious forms of inappropriate behaviour.

### The Defence’s portrayal of the Accused as a person of good character

196    In addition to the criticising the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, the Defence also sought to portray the Accused as a trustworthy and responsible man who had worked hard to provide for his family. His good character was supported by the evidence of S and the Accused’s nephew, K. in court. The Defence thus submitted that the alleged acts of molest were clearly out of character and that he would not have jeopardized his marriage by doing such acts.

197    However, a good image projected to others clearly is not a safe indication as to what a person would do in private. It cannot be gainsaid that many sexual offences have been committed by offenders in secret whilst being able to present a very clean image to the outside world. Thus, good character is at best a neutral piece of evidence and is clearly not helpful in assessing the likelihood of whether such a person would have committed an alleged offence.

### Evidence of S and K on alleged promise of police warning to be given to the Accused

198    S and K also provided some evidence in support of the contention of the Accused that he had been promised a stern warning by IO Lua. Both of them were present with the Accused at the police station during the reporting by the Accused as part of his bail conditions. They were there as they wanted the Accused to change his bailor as they did not trust M. They claimed that when they met M, M had assured them that everything will be fine as the IO had told her that she will be giving a warning to the Accused.

199    I found this assertion that M had given such an assurance clearly an afterthought in the Defence case. This matter was never raised with M when she was on the stand. Neither did the Accused testify to this in his evidence. The Accused had 2 opportunities to do so, once during the ancillary hearing and secondly after his defence was called and he elected to give evidence.

200    The rule in _Browne_ is similarly applicable here to exclude any weight to be given to the evidence given by S and K on this issue. I also found it hard that the IO would have given such an assurance to M. First, at that early stage of the investigations, it is unlikely that the IO would have received any direction on the charging position. She was not herself in a position to give such an assurance. Secondly, assuming she had given such a false assurance to the Accused to induce him to give an incriminatory statement, it then begs the question as to why, having obtained the statement, the IO would still continue with such a lie to M.

201    I thus found this assertion devoid of truth and gave no weight to it.

### The Accused’s implied admission to his guilt

#### The Accused’s response to M during the quarrel about touching of the stepdaughters

202    Finally, I found that the Accused had in his evidence reinforced my conclusion of his guilt. First was the fact that the Accused had implicitly admitted to touching the girls, in particular C1, during the quarrel with M. M had earlier testified that during the quarrel on the night of the Accused’s arrest, the Accused had complained that his stepdaughters did not respect him. M rebutted him by asking him how he would expect them to respect him when he had touched their breasts. M said the Accused had responded to this rebuke with these words, “C1’s boyfriend touched her and nothing happened”. M had then responded that the person was the boyfriend but it is different as he is the “Ah Pa”. M then said the Accused went to C1’s bedroom and banged on the door asking her to come out and saying to her, “Your boyfriend touched, is okay?”[^55].

203    This evidence of M was not challenged during her cross-examination. Instead, the Accused himself admitted to such a conversation in his evidence in chief. He stated that during the quarrel, M suddenly brought up the allegation that he had touched the three stepdaughters. He denied doing so, asking M why she kept making such an allegation. He then went to C1 who was in her room to question her, saying “Your boyfriend can touch you, why I cannot touch you?”

204    However, immediately after giving this evidence, he sought to explain that he meant that “touch” was referring to touching of her shoulder and that her boyfriend could hold her hand[^56].

205    His explanation that he was only referring to touching on the shoulder and holding of hand made no sense in the context of the allegation. He knew very well that the allegation was about touching the stepdaughters inappropriately, particularly on the breasts. When he replied that C1’s boyfriend could touch her, he was obviously referring to touching on an intimate part of the body and not merely on the shoulder or on the hand.

#### The Accused apologising to his stepdaughters after his arrest

206    Secondly, the Accused admitted to apologising to his stepdaughters and telling them that he did not want to go to jail. This happened after his arrest and upon being bailed out by M. M had earlier testified that when she bailed him out, the Accused had apologised to her and C3 who was with her. He informed her that he would apologise to C1 and C2 when he returned to the Flat. Subsequently, when he met C1 and C2, he had apologised to them and said, “Ah Pa does not want to go to jail”[^57].

207    In my view, this is again another implicit admission of his guilt in relation to the acts of molest on the three stepdaughters. The apology was also linked to his concern about going to jail as he must have recognised the seriousness of his wrongdoing and thus expressed his concern about the possibility of going to jail.

208    M’s evidence on this was not challenged during cross-examination. Instead, the Accused had expressly admitted to this aspect of the evidence. The DPP had specifically referred him to this evidence of M about his apology with the accompanying words of him not wanting to go to jail. The Accused confirmed that this evidence was correct on 2 occasions[^58].

209    The Accused maintained that he had apologised to them because the family had been broken up due to their false accusation against him.

210    I found his action of apologising to all three stepdaughters totally illogical and incongruent with how he was alleged to be feeling. He claimed that since they have wrongly accused him, he was feeling very angry and disappointed[^59]. In such a state, the last thing he would do is to apologise to his false accusers who had caused his family to be broken. He claimed that it was his character to apologise even though he was not the one who caused the problem.

211    Even if I can stretch the interpretation of his action to one where he is saying sorry for the fact that the family will soon be broken, it does not gel with his accompanying words about him not wanting to go to jail. These words brook no room for any misunderstanding about the nature of his apology. It was clearly an apology for the wrong he has done and an acknowledgment of his realisation of the very real prospect of a jail term.

## CONCLUSION ON THE ISSUE OF CONVICTION

212    In conclusion, I found that there was a preponderance of evidence to support the evidence of C1-C3 that they have been molested by the Accused in the manner and on the said dates in question. The main evidence in support of their evidence would be the Accused’s own admission in his police statement P3 and transcribed into typewritten form P4.

213    The Accused had further made implicit admissions in his interaction with M and with his three stepdaughters as set out above.

214    Accordingly, I found that the charges had been proven against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and found him guilty and convicted of the charges.

## THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE

### The Prosecution’s submissions

215    The Prosecution submitted that the principles of general deterrence and retribution must be given prominence in sexual offences which involved a breach of trust arising from a familial relationship, as was firmly reiterated by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span> (“_UI_”).

216    Based on the sentencing framework laid down in the case of _GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> (“_GBR_”), and subsequently adapted in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_) the Prosecution proposed the following sentences:

217    The Prosecution submitted for a global term of **at least 48 months’ imprisonment and 18 weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of caning**, given that the Accused is past 50 years old and was not eligible to be caned. The Prosecution also asked for all three individual sentences to be run consecutively as the offences were committed on different victims on different occasions.

218    The Prosecution highlighted a number of aggravating features of the case, such as the breach of trust reposed in the Accused as the stepfather of the victims, the degree of sexual exploitation and the young age of the victims in respect of the section 354(1) offences.

### The Defence’s submission on mitigation and sentencing

219    The Defence in their written submissions had asked for a sentence of 12 weeks for the offences under section 354(1) and for 6 months for the offence under section 354(2). It was also submitted for one sentence of 12 weeks to run consecutively with the 6 months’ sentence, giving a global sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment.

220    The Defence highlighted that there was no skin to skin contact and that the Accused was of good character with a clean record.

221    However, in court, the Defence Counsel changed their sentencing position and instead submitted for individual **sentences of 5 months’ imprisonment for each of the section 354(1) offences and 12 months’ imprisonment for the section 354(2) offence**. She also changed the Defence position on the number of sentences to be run consecutively from just two sentences to all three, giving **a global sentence of 1 year and 10 months’ imprisonment**.

222    The Defence further submitted that no additional imprisonment of caning should be imposed since at the time of the offences, the Accused was below 40 years’ old and would not think that caning would not be imposed on him at the time when he committed the offences.

### The Accused’s antecedent record

223    The Accused has no record of any previous convictions.

### The reasoning for the sentence

224    There are several aggravating features in the present case.

225    First and foremost, the offences were committed by the Accused on his step-daughters. They were thus in a familial relationship where he is put into a relationship of the authority over the victims and there would be much trust reposed in him. While these offences may have occurred early on in his marriage with M, nonetheless, the victims were clearly in a vulnerable state as they had just been brought into a totally new environment with a newly formed family nucleus. They also had to adapt to new school and living in a foreign country. They were clearly in a very dependent relationship _vis a vis_ the Accused. They looked to him to provide a roof over their heads as their new father. He obviously had to play a role in them obtaining a place in the schools here as well subsequently applying for their permanent residency. Hence it would have been very difficult for them to expose the Accused should he commit any wrongdoing on them. Hence, by preying on them, the Accused had committed a very egregious breach of this trust.

226    Secondly, the three victims were very young at the material time of the offences. This is especially so for C1 and C2 who were just above the minimum age of 14 for which an aggravated offence would have been committed. This factor of a young victim would already be taken into account in C3's case based on the aggravated outrage of modesty charge under s 354(2) of the Penal Code, hence would not be considered as an additional aggravating feature to avoid double counting.

227    Finally, the nature of the intrusion here involved the touching of sexual private parts of the victims, although there was no skin to skin contact. The Accused had specifically targeted the breasts of the three victims. It was not merely a fleeting touch. For C1, she had to struggle to free herself before the Accused let go of her after she had shouted. For C2, she felt a squeeze over her breast while she was asleep. C3 described her ordeal as one of a grab over breasts and using of thumb to rub over her breast in an up and down motion lasting for about a minute.

228    There clearly would be psychological harm given the young ages of the victims from 11-15 years old. There is no need for any Victim Impact Statement to be specifically prepared. In any case, all three of the victims had testified about the fear and disgust they felt. C1 had testified about feeling of insecurity and would wear a jacket even on a hot day as she would feel others are looking at her chest[^60]. C2 testified that she felt disgusted and she coped by trying to forget about the incidents[^61]. C3 felt fear after the incident and even dreamt about the Accused coming into the room while she was changing[^62].

229    Fortunately, they have all testified that they have decided to give the Accused a chance and I found that this seemed to have helped them to put the incidents behind them and they were able to move on with their lives.

230    As the Accused had claimed trial, no doubt, the harm caused would have been increased through the victims having to come to court and reliving the experience of those offending acts committed against them. During cross-examination, they would invariably had to endure allegations that they have lied about them being molested, thus having their credibility put into question. Hence no sentencing discount can be given to the Accused on the ground of a plea of guilt and the benefit sparing the victims of the trauma of recounting the sexual offences committed against them.

231    I note that the Accused has no previous convictions and this was the first time he is being sentenced for committing an offence and I accept that this is a mitigating factor.

232    It is undisputed that the 2 leading cases on offences in relation to sentencing of section 354(2) of the Penal Code offence and section 354(1) of the Penal Code offence are _GBR_ and _Kunasekaran_ respectively.

233    The “two-step sentencing bands” approach laid down in _GBR_ is as follows:

> (a)     The court would first identify which band the offence in question falls within and determine precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an indicative starting point, which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the offending act; and

> (b)     The court would then consider the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender.

234    The indicative starting points for the two offences as set out in _Kunasekaran_ and _GBR_ are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.3%"> <col width="39.26%"> <col width="36.44%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Section 354(1)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Section 354(2)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 5 months</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 1 year</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">5-15 months</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1-3 years</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">15-24 months</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3-5 years</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

235    In _GBR_, the High Court has classified Band 2 cases as those with two or more aggravating factors. Based on the number of offence-specific aggravating factors enumerated above which are more than three, I found that the offences committed by the Accused fell clearly somewhere on the midpoint of Band 2 for C1 and C2 and within the lower half of Band 2 for C3. The High Court in _GBR_ also held that caning would nearly always be imposed for cases within Band 2 of at least three strokes of the cane (see \[33\] of _GBR_).

236    In terms of mitigation, I find that the Accused did not show any remorse and hence there was no mitigating factor such as timeous plea of guilt present. I note however that the Accused to his credit did cease his offending behaviour and played his part of caregiver to the three stepchildren to a reasonable extent by buying food and giving of pocket money. He also bailed C2 out and helped all three stepchildren obtain permanent residency in 2018.

237    For C1 and C2, a sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. For C3, an appropriate sentence would be in the region of 16 months’ imprisonment. In the light of the aggravating factors, I would have also imposed a sentence of caning of three strokes for each offence

238    In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[41\] (“_Raveen_”), it was laid down that “as a general rule, a multiple offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively”. This is based in part on the fact that, “all else being equal, a multiple offender bears greater culpability and will have caused greater harm than an offender who has committed only a single offence” (see _Raveen_ at \[42\]).

239    Applying this principle, in order to give full effect to the fact that the Accused had committed an offence against three young children separately, all three sentences of imprisonment ought to be ordered to run consecutively. Each offence although similar is unrelated to each other.

240    The next step is to apply the principle of totality, which is for the sentencing judge to take “a last look” at all the facts and circumstances and be satisfied that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offeder’s overall criminality (see _Raveen_ at \[73\]).

241    It bears reminding that the totality principle is not an exercise in bulk discount but it is really to see if the overall sentence is proportionate to the overall criminality of the Accused and that the sentence should not be “crushing”. Here, totalling up the individual sentences would result in a sentence of 38 months’ imprisonment or slightly over three years. In my view, taking into account the mitigating circumstances, I would consider this sentence to be slightly on the high side. I took into account his age and the fact that this would be the first time he has been convicted of an offence and experience of prison time. Accordingly, I have calibrated the sentences for the individual sentences down to 9 months’ imprisonment for the offences committed against C1 and C2, and 14 months’ imprisonment for the offence committed against C3. With the three sentences of imprisonment ordered to run consecutively, the global sentence would 32 months’ imprisonment.

242    The final issue is whether I should impose imprisonment in lieu of caning. In _Amin Bin Abdullah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 904</span> (_Amin_), the High Court had held that the correct starting point was that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced, unless there were grounds to justify doing so and listed out the following factors:

> (a)     the need to compensate for the deterrent effect of caning that was lost by reason of the exemption;

> (b)     the need to compensate for the retributive effect of caning that was lost by reason of the exemption; and

> (c)     the need to maintain parity among co-offenders.

243    In present case, factors (a) and (b) would be relevant. The sentencing objectives of deterrence and retribution have already been set out earlier.

244    For factor (a), the first key question is whether the offender would have known before committing the offence that by reason of his own circumstances, he would be exempted from caning. Here, as pointed out by the Defence, the Accused being below 50 years old at the material time (2014-2015), he would not have known that he would be exempted from caning. The Accused turned 50 on 2 June 2017.

245    However, this is not the only consideration, as factor (b) is highly relevant here. Retribution has been identified as one of the dominant sentencing objectives and hence there is a need to compensate for loss of the retributive effect of caning lost by reason of the exemption from caning. Given the nature of the offences of sexual offences against vulnerable victims and the abuse of trust, I am of the view that imprisonment in lieu of caning is clearly warranted to compensate for the loss of the retributive effect.

246    Based on the indicative guidelines in _Amin_ at \[90\] of imprisonment term of 3-6 months for avoidance of 7-12 strokes of the cane, I agree with Prosecution’s submission of 6 weeks for every three strokes for each charge, giving a total 18 weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of 9 strokes of the cane. The additional 18 weeks’ sentence against the contemplated global sentence of 32 months would not be considered as only having a marginal retributive effect as it will cause the sentence to be increased by about 14%. I had accordingly imposed an additional imprisonment term of 18 weeks in lieu of 9 strokes of the cane which had been avoided by virtue of the age of the Accused.

## CONCLUSION

247    Based on the overall criminality of the Accused and the distinct nature of the offences with harm caused to three different individuals, I have ordered all the three sentences of imprisonment imposed to run consecutively. In addition, to ensure that the retributive effect of caning is not lost, I have imposed a total of 18 weeks’ imprisonment _in lieu_ of the 9 strokes of caning which I would have otherwise imposed but for the age of the Accused.
