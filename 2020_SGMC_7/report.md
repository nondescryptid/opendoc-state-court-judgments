\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9244/2019/01.\]

20 February 2020

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Part 1   Charges

1       On 26 Aug 2019, the Accused pleaded guilty to the following two charges:

> MCN 900117/2019 (marked ‘C1A’)

> You, Ainon Binte Mohamed Ali, …, Female/50 years, …, are charged that you, on 15 August 2017, at or about 8.00 pm, at Block 842D Tampines Street 82 #XXX, did voluntarily cause hurt to \[the Victim\] (Male / 12 years old … …), _to wit_, by using your knuckles to knock him on his head multiple times and using your right hand to pull and twist his left ear, causing him to sustain bruising and swelling on his head and suffer bodily pain, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> MCN 900118/2019 (marked ‘C2A’)

> You, Ainon Binte Mohamed Ali, …, Female/50 years, …, are charged that you, on 18 August 2017, at or about 8.00 pm, at Block 842D Tampines Street 82 #XXX, did voluntarily cause hurt to \[the Victim\] (Male / 12 years old … …), _to wit_, by using your right hand to pinch both his thighs multiple times, causing him to sustain bruising on his thighs, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)).

## Part 2   Conviction, Sentence and Appeal

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) (Exhibit P1) without qualification. I found her guilty and convicted her accordingly.

3       The Accused also admitted to a third charge (MCN 900116/2019 – marked as ‘C3A’) of voluntarily causing hurt to the same victim. The Accused gave her consent to have this third charge taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

4       In my deliberation on sentence, I have considered the Prosecution’s oral address on sentence and the Defence’s written Plea-in-Mitigation (Exhibit D1) supplemented by oral arguments. I have also studied the various case precedents used by both parties. In the final analysis, I was not convinced by the psychiatric reports adduced by the Defence that there was a causal link between the commission of the offences and the Accused’s mental conditions. As such, I declined to call for a Mandatory Treatment Order suitability report. Having done so, I proceeded to sentence the Accused. I found that a custodial sentence was warranted. I imposed a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment on each of the two proceeded charges. The two sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently. Thus, the aggregate sentence is four weeks’ imprisonment.

5       The Accused was dissatisfied with the said sentences. She has filed an appeal against sentence. She was released on bail pending appeal.

## Part 3   Facts of The Case

### A   Background

6       The Accused, who is currently 51 years old, was working as a Senior Staff Nurse at Sunlove Abode for the Intellectually-Infirmed (see Plea-in-Mitigation at \[11\]). She gave tuition on a part-time basis (see SOF at \[3\]).

7       The Victim was tutored in Mathematics by the Accused. He would go over to the Accused’s place of residence at Block 842D, Tampines Street 82, #XXX, for his Mathematics tuition lessons. He started his first tuition lesson with the Accused on 2 May 2017. Each tuition lesson was from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. The tuition lessons were held together with Accused’s other students. The students were seated around the Accused’s dining table, and the Victim sat next to the Accused, on her right.

8       The Victim was only 12 years old at the time when the Accused assaulted him.

### B   The Proceeded Charges – Two Incidents of Assault on the Victim

### (i)   MCN 900117/2019 (marked as ‘C1A’)

9       On 15 August 2017, at about 7 p.m., the Victim went to the Accused’s residence for his Mathematics tuition lesson. At or about 8 p.m., the Accused knocked the Victim on his head with her knuckles several times. This assault caused to the Victim to suffer bruising and swelling on his head. The Accused pulled and twisted the Victim’s left ear with her right hand. This caused the Victim to suffer bodily pain.

10     That night, the Victim returned home crying. He informed his mother of the assault he had received at the hands of the Accused. His mother checked his head and found some bruising and swelling on his head.

11     The Victim’s mother sent a text message to the Accused to find out what had happened. The Accused admitted to the Victim’s mother that she had used his knuckles to hit the Victim for making mistakes and getting the wrong answers to the questions that he was given to do.

12     The Victim’s mother told the Accused not to assault the Victim. Instead, the Accused should inform her so that she could discipline the Victim accordingly. The Accused agreed to do so.

13     The Victim’s mother decided to let the Victim continue his tuition lessons with the Accused because his examinations were approaching, and the Victim’s mother held the belief that the Accused would not repeat her actions, presumably using physical force to discipline the Victim.

### (ii)   MCN 900118/2019 (marked as ‘C2A’)

14     On 18 August 2017, at about 7 p.m., the Victim went to the Accused’s residence for his Mathematics tuition lesson. At or about 8 p.m., the Victim made a mistake while answering some questions. This angered the Accused. The Accused used her right hand to pinch both of the Victim’s thighs multiple times. The Victim tried to move away, but the Accused pinched and held onto the Victim’s thighs.

15     That night, when the Victim was returning to his home, he found some bruises and slight bleeding on his thighs. There were also fingernail marks on his left arm. Upon reaching home, the Victim informed his father. His father took some photographs of the Victim’s injuries.

16     The Prosecution tendered seven photographs of the Victim (Exhibit P2). The first photograph shows the Victim. The other six photographs show the injuries on the Victim’s inner thighs and left arm. A close-up photograph of the Victim’s left inner thigh shows some dried-up blood surrounded by a very large bruise.

17     On 19 August 2017, at the Pasir Ris Neighbourhood Police Centre, the Victim’s mother lodged a police report against the Accused for the physical assaults she has committed on the Victim.

### C   Victim’s Medical Reports

18     The Victim’s medical report (Exhibit P3) was prepared by Dr Wong Jia Min, a Medical Officer with the Department of Emergency Medicine, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“KKH”). The said medical report revealed that the Victim was seen by Dr Glenn Goh at the Children’s Emergency Department of KKH on 20 August 2017 and the following injuries were documented:

> (i)     A 10 cm by 8 cm bruise over his left thigh, with small central areas of superficial abrasions with scab formation.

> (ii)     A 9 cm by 6 cm bruise over his left thigh, with small central areas of superficial abrasions with scab formation.

> (iii)     Two bruises, measuring 2cm by 1cm, over his right thigh.

> (iv)     Two sub-centimetre scabs over his left forearm.

> (v)     Left thigh pain upon extension of his left knee joint.

19     The medical report also documented that the Victim had complained of residual pain over his head and bruises over both thighs.

20     The Victim was given six days of medical leave (20 – 25 August 2017). He was referred, amongst other referrals, to the hospital’s Psychosocial Trauma Support Service (“PTSS”).

21     The Prosecution also adduced a report on the Victim by PTSS (hereinafter referred to as the ‘PTSS report’). The PTSS report (Exhibit P4) was prepared by Lim Xin Yi, Senior Principal Psychologist and Head of PTSS. The most pertinent paragraph of the PTSS report is reproduced in its entirety below:

> 4.    At initial presentation, \[the victim\] presented with some symptoms of post-traumatic stress since the alleged physical abuse. \[The victim\] reported re-experiencing symptoms such as having nightmares about the alleged physical abuse (about once a week), and thinking about the alleged physical abuse when he sees people fight or he hears people say the Malay word "sedap" (a word frequently said by the tuition teacher when he was physically abused by her). He reported feeling very upset whenever he was reminded about what happened. \[The victim\] said he felt angry towards the tuition teacher and some self-blame, for not being able to physically protect himself during the episodes of physical abuse. He avoided talking about the alleged physical abuse especially with friends, and would stay away from Tampines, which is where the tuition teacher's home was located. \[The victim\] was also very hesitant to start tuition with another tuition teacher, especially when it would be at the tuition teacher's place. \[The victim's\] mother reported similar concerns about \[the victim’s\] presenting difficulties. In addition, she said that \[the victim\] was more irritable at home, and seemed to have a drop in his appetite, and required more encouragement to finish his food during mealtimes.

22     The Victim was seen by Dr Cai Yiming (“Dr Cai”), an Emeritus Consultant with the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”). The Victim was already 13 years old and attending school at secondary one level when he saw Dr Cai. Dr Cai prepared a report on the Victim (hereinafter referred to as the ‘IMH report’). The IMH report (Exhibit P5) was also adduced by the Prosecution. The relevant portions of the IMH report are reproduced below:

> 4.    … … The worse incident was in August 2017 when the accused used fingers to “grab and pinch” his inner thigh over his pants very hard as she asked him whether it was “sedap, sedap (Malay words for nice)” ? As he left the home of the accused and went into the lift, he realised that had bleeding in his thighs.

> 5.    Following the alleged offence, he had developed fear of going for private tuition again. He also had dreams in which he saw the accused scolding and hitting him in his sleeps. He tried to forget these past incidents.

## Part 4   The Accused’s Antecedent

23     The Accused has a previous conviction in 1999. This was for an offence of Voluntarily Causing Hurt to a Domestic Maid under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 1985 Rev Ed.) read with section 73 of the same Code. Another charge of the same nature was taken into consideration. The Accused was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment.

## Part 5   Sentence

### A   Prosecution’s Position on Sentence

24     The Prosecution sought a four weeks’ imprisonment term for the Accused. The Prosecution submitted that the factual matrix of this case brings it within Band 1 of the sentencing guideline enunciated in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”). The sentencing guideline for the offence under s 323 PC as enunciated in _Low Song Chye’s_ case is reproduced below.

25     The Prosecution highlighted three main aggravating factors. These were:

> (a)     The Victim was young and vulnerable at 12 years of age;

> (b)     The Accused, being in a superior position as the Victim’s tutor, has clearly abused the trust placed upon her by the Victim and the Victim’s mother; and

> (c)     The bruises sustained by the Victim were rather significant in size (see \[18(i) & 18(ii)\] above) and there was also psychological distress (see \[21\] and \[22\] above).

26     The Prosecution submitted a Table of Sentencing Precedents in which three cases were stated for this Court’s consideration. The three cases _are Public Prosecutor v Moe Thu Zar Oo_ (SC-905405-2019, unreported), _Public Prosecutor v Lalkhawngaihi_ (SC-904802-2015, unreported) and _Foo Ah Choo v Public Prosecutor_ (MA 384 of 1992, unreported).

> (a)     The first two cases involved offenders who were foreign domestic workers who had physically assaulted their respective employers’ young children – age seven years’ old and nine months’ old respectively. The accused persons were each sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment.

> (b)     For the third case, the care-taker offender inflicted cane marks and bruises on a two years’ old victim. In respect of the s 323 PC charge, the offender was given a two months’ imprisonment term. Her appeal against sentence was dismissed.

27     The Prosecution’s submission was that the above case precedents were more egregious than the present case. Hence, the Prosecution has calibrated the sentence downward, and submitted that a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment would be an adequate sentence for the present case.

### B   Plea-in-Mitigation and Defence’s Positions on Sentence

### (i)   Defence’s main sentencing position – Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”)

28     The Defence submitted that the Accused was suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder following the death of her mother on 30 July 2017. The Defence also submitted that the Accused was suffering from severe grief and trauma at the material time of the offences and continues to suffer from the same, for which she is undergoing treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. \[See \[9\] of Plea-in-Mitigation (Exhibit D1).\]

29     The Defence relied on Dr Munidasa Winslow’s (“Dr Winslow”) report \[hereinafter referred to as the _“Initial Report”_ (see Annex A to Exhibit D2)\] which stated at paragraph 19 that the Accused’s _“behaviour of pinching the boy_ **_appears to be_** _directly related to her experience of acute distress following the unexpected loss of her mother and work pressures that results in a Major Depression Disorder. It was noted to be highly out of character for her and occurred at a time in her life when she was undergoing intense stress that resulted in clinically significant mental health symptoms.”_ (Emphasis in bold and underline added). The _Initial Report_ was dated 3 January 2018.

30     In a letter dated 29 July 2019, which was slightly more than 18 months from 3 January 2018, the Defence sought a clarification from Dr Winslow, although the nature of such clarification was not stated. In his letter dated 15 August 2019, Dr Winslow gave a simple reply: _“\[p\]aragraph 19 of our Medico-legal Report dated 3 January 2019 sets out the medical opinion that Ms Ainon’s commission of the act is directly attributed to the symptoms she was suffering. In other words, that there is a casual link between her mental conditions and the act.”_ It appeared to me that the clarification sought pertained to whether there was any causal link between the Accused’s Major Depressive Disorder and the commission of the offences. No reasoning or analysis was provided. I shall refer to Dr Winslow’s letter of 15 August 2019 as the _“2_nd_Report_”. (See Annex B to Exhibit D2.)

31     The Defence also adduced a report from Dr Lim Wen Phei of Tan Tock Seng Hospital (see Annex C of Exhibit D2). Dr Lim’s report was dated 15 April 2019. Dr Lim diagnosed the Accused with Major Depressive Disorder. Dr Lim’s report did not give any forensic insight on the issue whether there was any causal link between the Accused’s commission of the offences and her mental conditions.

32     Relying on the abovementioned three reports, the Defence made its case that this Court should call for a MTO suitability report. The Defence’s main argument was that _“\[i\]t is unlikely that the Accused would have reacted the way she did, had she not been experiencing acute distress, traumatic grief and Major Depressive Disorder at the material time.”_ (See Plea-in-Mitigation at \[21\].) The Defence referred this Court to the case of _GCX v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1325</span> at \[34\] (_“GCX”_) where the High Court sets out some guidance as to how the sentencing principles of deterrence, retribution, prevention and rehabilitation should be balanced in cases where the offender suffered from a mental disorder at the time the offender committed the offence.

33     Needless to say, the Prosecution disagreed with the Defence’s position on calling for a MTO suitability report. The Prosecution submitted that little weight should be given to Dr Winslow’s _Initial Report_. The Prosecution argued that firstly, there were factual inaccuracies in the _Initial Report_ and highlighted two – (a) the Accused’s assertion to Dr Winslow that she has no previous criminal history; and (b) the Accused downplaying the extent of her assault on the Victim. The Defence conceded on (b). The criminal records (Exhibit P6) has disproved (a). Secondly, the Prosecution criticised both Dr Winslow’s _Initial Report_ and his _2_nd_Report_ for the lack of specificity as to how the Accused’s mental condition(s) can be said to have contributed so significantly to the offending conduct that it diminishes the Accused’s capacity to exercise self-control and restraint, and hence reduces her culpability for the commission of the offences : _Chong Yee Ka v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 309</span> at \[82\].

34     The Prosecution’s critic on Dr Winslow’s _Initial Report_ and his _2_nd_Report_ did not go unnoticed by the Defence.

35     The hearing on 26 August 2019 was adjourned for this Court to consider sentence. The next hearing date was set for 1 October 2019.

36     In the meantime, on 3 September 2019, the Defence submitted online, via the State Courts’ Integrated Case Management System, another report from Dr Winslow (hereinafter referred to as the _“3_rd_Report”_). The _3_rd_Report_ was dated 2 September 2019. The _3_rd_Report_ arose out of an email dated 20 August 2019 sent by the Defence seeking an explanation from Dr Winslow how the Accused’s mental condition at the material times had a direct causal relationship to her commission of the offences. Responding to the said email, the _3_rd_Report_ stated that individuals who suffer from Major Depressive Disorder have difficulty with effectively controlling his/her emotional state. Such individuals respond to difficult and frustrating tasks with greater anger reactivity. Further, such individuals display a tendency to react impulsively to negative emotions. These would thus explain the Accused’s behaviour in relation to the offences when she lost her cool and unusually over-reacted towards the Victim’s wilfulness during tuition. Dr Winslow also stated that it was important to note that there is no history of the Accused ever behaving violently or aggressively towards children.

37     The Prosecution submitted that Dr Winslow appeared ignorant of the Accused’s antecedents. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused has not been forthright and candid with Dr Winslow. Taken together, this does not inspire confidence in Dr Winslow’s reports.

38     The Defence submitted orally that there was an error in the _Initial Report_. The Defence asserted that Dr Winslow was aware of the Accused’s previous antecedents and that it was dated.

39     I shall digress a bit and deal with \[37\] and \[38\] above. I was not persuaded by the Defence’s submission. Firstly, Dr Winslow has stated unequivocally in the _Initial Report_ that _“Mrs Ainon has no previous criminal history.”_ This sentence is crystal clear. Secondly, this Court cannot accept evidence given by Counsel from the bar.

40     I shall deal with other aspects of the Defence’s application to call for a MTO suitability report at Part 5 – Section C below.

### (ii)   Defence’s second sentencing position – Seeking a fine

41     In addition to the Accused’s mental conditions, the Defence raised the following in the mitigation plea:

> (a)     The Accused has pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity;

> (b)     The Accused is remorseful and deeply regrets the distress which she has caused to the Victim and his parents;

> (c)     The Accused’s previous criminal conviction is dated, being almost 20 years old. Whilst not expressly stated, I took this submission as little or no weight ought to be attached to the Accused’s antecedents;

> (d)     The Accused is also suffering from other medical ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, cervical spondylitis and a growth on her spine compressing her nerves, resulting in numbness on her right side; and

> (e)     The Accused’s general good character which was based on the notes submitted by her students and ex-students from her tuition classes (see Annex E to Exhibit D2), as well as a letter from Sunlove (see Annex F to Exhibit D2).

42     I understand the Defence’s alternate sentencing submission to be that the Accused’s conduct, for sentencing purposes, falls within Band 1 of _Low Song Chye’s_ sentencing guideline. Unlike the Prosecution, the Defence submitted that a fine would be an appropriate sentence. The Defence argued that the Victim suffered minimal injuries; the Accused’s action was not premeditated and were committed on the spur of the moment out of frustration and under the influences of her mental disorder and traumatic grief; and the incidents had occurred over a very short period of time.

43     In the Plea-in-Mitigation, the Defence drew this Court’s attention to the cases of _Soh Meiyun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 90</span> (_“Soh Meiyun”_) and _Public Prosecutor v Lee Beng Yong @ Muhammad Zaki Lee_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 12</span> (_“Lee Beng Yong”_) where the offenders were given fine of $4000 or $3500 for committing a s 323 PC offence.

### (iii)   Defence’s third sentencing position – Short Custodial Sentence

44     In a mere one-liner, devoid of any substantive arguments, the Defence urged this Court to consider a sentence of not more than three weeks’ imprisonment.

### C   Rejecting Defence’s application to call for a MTO suitability report

### (i)   Application of MTO principles to the facts of this case

45     I can understand and appreciate the Defence’s argument if the case had been a one-off incident, and the Accused has a clean record. However, this was not a one-off incident as can be seen from the charges that three offences were committed on different days, namely, one day in May 2017, 15 August 2017 and 18 August 2017. Even though the Accused’s antecedent is dated, it nonetheless revealed that the Accused has used violence from a position of authority, which was the same in the present case.

46     I accept that rehabilitation may be a relevant consideration, but it does not necessarily dictate a lighter sentence. An MTO should be ordered where rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing consideration on the facts of a particular case. The threshold for calling for an MTO suitability report, on the other hand, is lower, and the court may call for an MTO suitability report if there is evidence that the offender possessed rehabilitative potential. See _GCX_ at \[32\]. In my judgment, I found that the Defence has not presented any evidence showing the Accused possesses any rehabilitative potential. The Defence’s psychiatric reports were so lacking in cogency and reasoning that they simply did not do anything to establish some rehabilitative potential.

47     During oral arguments, the Prosecution drew this Court’s attention to _Chong Yee Ka_ at \[59\] where the High Court stated:

> 59.    I am not prepared to accept as a general rule that depression in whatever form, … …, will “cause” one to commit violence. I accept that it can contribute to various behavioural manifestations of maladjustment such as irritability or idiosyncratic conduct or impulse control. But I do not accept that it will directly and inevitably “cause” violence. There may be exceptional cases where such an opinion might be credibly proffered…

48     I agree fully with the High Court’s opinion, and I found it applicable to the present case. In the present case, the Accused was able to function normally as she was able to give tuition class to the Accused and other students at the same time. There were nothing amiss or abnormal. The critical fact was that the Accused found the Victim to be a more challenging student to teach. It was in such circumstance that she had resorted to physical abuse. It was very telling when the Defence has conceded as much in its Plea-in-Mitigation:

> 19.    We are instructed that on 15 August 2017, Ainon had a meeting with her CEO after she had an altercation with her Associate Director. Later that day, she found it extremely challenging to tutor \[the Victim\]. … … \[The Victim’s\] mother had also told Ainon to treat \[the Victim\] like her own child and _“to be hard on him please”_. Unable to control \[the Victim\], she then rapped him on the head. On 18 August 2017, \[the Victim\] misbehaved yet again and continued to act in an obstinate and defiant manner. … … Ainon reacted uncharacteristically in a moment of frustration and pinched \[the Victim\] on his thighs to get him to behave.

49     The use of physical force by the Accused was to assert control and instil discipline. Nonetheless, it was wrong in the eyes of the law.

### (ii)   Lack of cogency and reasoning in the psychiatric reports that there was a causal link between the Accused’s commission of the offences and her mental conditions

50     In _Kanagaratnam Nicholas Jens v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 887</span> (_“Kanagaratnam”_), Sundaresh Menon CJ highlighted the importance of psychiatric reports. In the said judgment, CJ Menon said:

> 1.    … … In the context of criminal cases, psychiatric reports prepared by psychiatrists or psychologists are professional assessment of the offender’s mental capability, which is a key factor in questions of liability as well as sentencing. It is therefore no exaggeration to say that psychiatric reports are of vital importance because they can have real impact on an offender’s life and liberty.

> 2    Given the importance of such evidence, experts must appreciate that they cannot merely present their conclusions without also presenting the underlying evidence and the analytical process by which the conclusions are reached. Otherwise, the Court will not be in a position to evaluate the soundness of the proffered views. Where this the case, the Court will commonly reject that evidence: _Singapore Medical Council v Lim Lian Ann_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 172</span> at \[43\]; _PP v Chia Kee Chen and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 249</span> at \[119\].

51     It was clear to this Court that in both the _Initial Report_ and the _2_nd_Report_, Dr Winslow has failed to provide the analytical process by which he had arrived at the conclusion that there was a causal link between the Accused’s mental conditions and her commission of the offences. On the authority of _Kanagaratnam_, I rejected the Defence’s contention that there was a causal link between the Accused’s mental conditions and her commission of the offences.

52     Paragraph \[19\] of the _Initial Report_ reads: _“Mrs Ainon’s behaviour of_ _pinching the boy_ **_appears to be_** _directly related to her experience of acute distress following the unexpected loss of her mother and work pressures that results in a Major Depressive Disorder.”_ (Emphasis inserted by the court.). There were two areas of doubts with the said paragraph. These were:

> (a)     The use of the phrase “appears to be” shows that the conclusion reached is not unequivocal. It is suggestive that it was equally possible that there was no direct relationship between the mental conditions and the commission of the offence.

> (b)     Paragraph \[19\] of the _Initial Report_, if accepted, only addresses the second proceeded charge (see MCN 900118/2019 at \[1\] above) _viz_ the act of pinching the Victim’s thigh. The said report was completely silent on the use of force by the Accused in respect of the first proceeded charge (MCN 900117/2019 – using her knuckles to knock on the Victim’s head as well as using her right hand to pull and twist the Victim’s head). The _Initial Report_ was also silent on the use of force by the Accused in respect of the charge that was taken into consideration (MCN 900116/2019 – using her right knuckles to knock the Victim’s head).

53     From the _2_nd_Report_, one can detect that Dr Winslow has shifted his initial equivocal position of _“appears to be directly related to”_ to a committed position _“that there is a causal link between her mental conditions and the act”._ However, Dr Winslow did not provide any reasoning or analysis for the conclusion stated therein. The Defence did not provide any explanation for the change in Dr Winslow’s position. For want of an adequate explanation by the Defence, I rejected the _2_nd_Report._

54     I shall now deal with the _3_rd_Report_. Paragraph \[3\] of the _3_rd_Report_ reads:

> “As stated at \[19\] of the Report, Mrs Ainon’s commission of the alleged offences was (emphasis added) “…**_directly related to_** _her experience of acute distress following_ **_the unexpected loss of her mother and work pressures that results in a Major Depressive Disorder_**_…”_ (Emphasis came from the _3_rd_Report_ itself.)

55     The _3_rd_Report_ contained the same failing as the _2_nd_Report_, namely, the Defence has failed to provide any explanation for the shift in position between the equivocal position of the _Initial Report_ to there being a direct causal link. From the manner that paragraph \[19\] was quoted and used in the _3_rd_Report_, it was obvious that Dr Winslow has conveniently glossed over the phrase “appears to be”. Furthermore, Dr Winslow has now extended the coverage of his opinion from one single act (_viz_ pinching of the Victim’s thigh) to the “alleged **offences**”. Again, no explanation was provided by Dr Winslow nor the Defence. The Defence bore the evidential burden to prove there was a causal link between the Accused’s mental conditions and the commission of the offences. In my judgment, the Defence has failed to discharge its burden.

56     In _Anita Damu v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 233</span>, another decision of Menon CJ on psychiatric report, it was held:

> 1.    The evidence of psychiatric experts is often of considerable value when the court is confronted with the issue of an accused person’s mental state, such as when a diagnosis of a mental illness at the time of the offence would negate any _men rea_, or reduced the accused person’s culpability for the offence. … … it is incumbent on the court to satisfy itself that any expert evidence it is invited to accept is first relevant and admissible, and then, coherent and resting on sound premises.”

57     I did not find that the _3_rd_Report_ was coherent _vis-a-vis_ the _Initial Report_. I also did not find that _3_rd_Report_ was resting on sound premises.

58     For the reasons given in the preceding four paragraphs, I rejected the _3_rd_Report_.

59     For avoidance of doubt, this Court’s rejection of the _Initial Report_, the _2_nd_Report_ and the _3_rd_Report_ was a rejection of Dr Winslow’s assessment that there was a causal link between the Accused’s mental conditions and her commissions of the offences. In the final analysis, I exercised my discretion in not calling for a MTO suitability report.

### D   Court’s Decision on Sentence - A custodial sentence was warranted

60     The applicable sentencing guideline in the present case is that set out in _Low Song Chye_ (see \[24\] above).

61     In addition, I took the position that general deterrence in sentencing was applicable to this case. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender. The use of wanton violence, in addition to harming their immediate victims, also have the wider-felt impact of triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public. It is in the public interest that a strong message be sent that that the commission of such crimes would be met with a lengthy custodial sentence. See _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[24\] – \[25\].

62     Next, I also held the view that specific deterrence in sentencing was also applicable in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an offender to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition: _PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[25\] – \[29\].

63     In determining the appropriate sentence, I followed the two-step framework stated at \[78\] of _Low Song Chye_. The first step was to determine the indicative starting point for sentencing based on the seriousness of the injury. The second step was to make adjustment for the offender’s culpability by taking into account the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating circumstances.

64     At the first step, I was in agreement with the Prosecution and Defence that the present case comes within Band 1 of _Low Song Chye’s_ sentencing guideline. At this point, I disagreed with the Defence’s submission that a fine is an adequate punishment. In my judgment, even the imposition of the maximum fine of $5000 would not have any general deterrent effect at all. The sentencing outcome in _Soh Meiyun_ has limited scope for application as that was an exceptional case, and one can expect that the mitigatory weight accorded to any mental illness must ultimately turn on the nature and severity of the illness and how that impacted upon the commission of the offence: _Soh Meiyun_ at \[52\]. As for the case of _Lee Yong Beng_, the Prosecution has provided an update that on appeal by the prosecution, the fine imposed by the trial judge has been set aside and a custodial term of two weeks’ imprisonment was meted out by the appellate court. (See Certificate of Result of Appeal – Exhibit P10). In my judgment, on account of the injuries suffered by the Victim, both physical and psychological, as well as the strong need for specific and general deterrence, a sentence of imprisonment was warranted. At this stage of the sentencing analysis, it was my assessment that the appropriate indicative sentencing range was between two to three weeks’ imprisonment.

65     At the second step of the sentencing framework, I had to exercise caution in determining the appropriate length of sentence. Whilst I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the case precedents it has cited were more egregious than the present case, I would place little weight on these case precedents because they were unreported cases. Sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations should bear little weight, if any, because they are unreasoned. Such decisions have to be approached with caution. See _Janardana Jayasankarr v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1288</span> at \[13(b)\]. See also _Yap Ah Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span> at \[39\] and _Keeping Mark John v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 627</span> at \[18\].

66     It is my assessment that there should be uplift on the indicative sentencing range. There were three reasons for the uplift. Firstly, the culpability of the Accused was assessed to be medium on account of the aggravating factors (see \[25\] above) presented in this case. Secondly, another charge was taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The said charge is also for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to the Victim. Thirdly, I have taken into account the Accused’s previous conviction (see \[23\] above).

67     The only mitigating factor present in this case was the Accused’s plea of guilt. Other than the Accused’s plea of guilt, there are no significant mitigating factors in the Accused’s favour.

68     In the final analysis, the need for an uplift of the indicative starting sentences far outweighed the sole mitigating factor.

69     For the reasons given, I imposed a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment on each proceeded charge.

### E   Sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently

70     The two offences were clearly distinct. However, the two offences were committed against the same victim within a short space of time. As such, it would be proper to run the individual sentences concurrently. In my judgment, this would be in line with the totality principle: _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[47\] – \[66\].

## Part 6   Conclusion

71     For the reasons given above, the Accused was given a custodial sentence and the total aggregate sentence was four weeks’ imprisonment.
