### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## INTRODUCTION

1       Mr Loon Wai Yang (also known as Axl Loon), currently 39 years of age, was the vice-president and a manager of a company known as Web Weaver Fusion Pte Ltd (“**WWF**”). In 2006 to 2008, WWF submitted goods and services tax (“**GST**”) returns for five quarterly accounting periods which contained _false_ entries. This resulted in the undercharging of GST or overclaiming of GST refunds worth a total of $144,363.52.

2       Following investigations by the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax (the “**Comptroller**”), five charges were brought against the defendant in relation to the false GST returns submitted by the company. The charges were brought under s 62(1)(b) read with s 74(1) of the _Goods and Services Tax Act_ (Cap 117A, Rev Ed 2005) (the “**GST Act**”).

3       The defendant claimed trial to the charges. After a trial he was found guilty and convicted on the charges. On 12 March 2019 he was sentenced to a total of 8 weeks’ imprisonment, and also ordered to pay a penalty of $433,090.56 (three times the GST amount) to the Comptroller. He filed the present appeal against his conviction and sentence the same day. The prosecution subsequently filed an appeal against the sentence on 26 March 2019. The defendant is presently on bail pending the appeal.

4       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charges

5       The defendant faced five charges under s 62(1)(b) read with s 74(1) of the GST Act. The five charges were similarly worded, with different particulars relating to the date on which the false GST return was submitted, the relevant accounting period, and the details of the false return:

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on or about _\[date\]_, in Singapore, being a manager, in your capacity as Vice-President of Web Weaver Fusion Pte Limited (ROC 199501448N) (“WWF”) when WWF did wilfully with intent to evade tax, made a false entry in the Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) return of WWF for _\[accounting period\]_, to wit, by _\[details of false return\]_, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 62(1)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap. 117A), read with section 74(1) of the same, and punishable under section 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the same.

6       The particulars of the charges are set out in the following table:

#### Relevant statutory provisions

7       The relevant statutory provisions are reproduced below.

8       Under s 62(1)(b) of the GST Act, it is an offence to make any false entry in any return under the Act with the intent to evade tax:

> 62.—(1)     _Any person who wilfully with intent to evade_ or to assist any other person to evade _tax_ —

>> \[...\]

>> (b) _makes any false_ statement or _entry in any return_, claim or application made under this Act;

>> \[...\]

> shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction —

>> (i)    pay a penalty assessed under section 48 of 3 times the amount of tax which has or would have been undercharged in consequence of the offence or which would have been undercharged if the offence had not been detected; and

>> (ii)   be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.

9       Under s 62(2) of the GST Act, when it has been proved that any false entry has been made in any return, there is a (rebuttable) presumption that the false entry was made with intent to evade tax:

> Whenever in any proceedings under this section it is proved that _any false_ statement or _entry is made in any return_, claim or application furnished under this Act by or on behalf of any person or in any books of account or other records maintained by or on behalf of any person, _that person shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have made that false_ statement or _entry with intent to evade tax_.

10     Under s 74(1) of the GST Act, an officer of a company may be found guilty of an offence committed by the company:

> 74.— (1)    Where an offence under this Act has been committed by a company, firm, society or other body of persons, _any person who at the time of the commission of the offence was a_ director, _manager_, secretary or other similar officer or a partner of the company, firm, society or other body of persons or was purporting to act in that capacity _shall be deemed to be guilty_ of that offence unless he proves that —

>> (a)     _the offence was committed without his consent or connivance; and_

>> (b)     _he exercised all such diligence to prevent the commission of the offence as he ought to have exercised, having regard to the nature of his functions in that capacity and to all the circumstances._

#### Prosecution’s case

#### (a)   Overview of prosecution’s evidence

11     The prosecution’s case was established by way of the conditioned statements[^1] and oral testimony of a number of prosecution witnesses, as well as a large quantity of documentary evidence. The main evidence came from two officers of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“**IRAS**”), who conducted the audit of WWF and investigated the offences committed by the company:

> (a)     Ms Yong Pei Shan, Senior Tax Auditor with the GST Division of IRAS (PW5, “**Ms Yong**”; conditioned statement marked as “**Exh P5**”).

> (b)     Ms Tan Mei Ling, Senior Tax Investigator with the Investigation and Forensics Division of IRAS (PW6, “**Ms Tan**”; conditioned statement marked as “**Exh P6**”).

12     Other relevant evidence was adduced from the following witnesses concerning their dealings (or lack of such dealings) with WWF:

> (a)     Ms Phyllis Chua Siew Hwa (PW1, “**Ms Chua**”; conditioned statement marked as “**Exh P1**”). Ms Chua was the Executive Director of City Life Advertising Pte Ltd, which was the owner of a sole proprietorship known as Singnan Advertising Agency (“**Singnan**”).

> (b)     Ms Long Chay Tai (PW2, “**Ms Long**”; conditioned statement marked as “**Exh P2**”). Ms Long was the Group Financial Controller of Cathay Organisation; she provided the statement on behalf of Cathay Organisation and Cathay Building 2002 Private Limited (“**Cathay Building**”).

> (c)     Geoffrey Lee Hock Eng (PW3, “**Mr Lee**”; conditioned statement marked as “**Exh P3**”). Mr Lee was the Director of Kian An Realty Limited (“**Kian An**”).

> (d)     Mohamad Pauzi Bin Ali (PW4, “**Mr Pauzi**”; conditioned statement marked as “**Exh P4**”). Mr Pauzi was a representative of the DBS Bank Ltd (“**DBS Bank**”).

13     Two statements recorded by IRAS from the defendant were also tendered in evidence:

> (a)     Statement of the defendant recorded on 8 October 2008 (LWY/1, (“**Exh P9**”); and

> (b)     Statement of the defendant recorded on 18 April 2011 (LWY/3, “**Exh P8**”).

#### (b)   Defendant’s role in WWF

14     It was not in dispute that WWF was a family business owned by the defendant and his parents. The defendant held 50% of the shares in the company (1000 shares), while his mother (Ong Luan Choo, “**mother**”) and father (Loon Peng Thong, “**father**”) each held 25% (500 shares each).[^2] The defendant held various positions in WWF, including “Managing Director”[^3] and “Secretary”[^4]. From 2003 to 2014 he was “Vice-President”.[^5]

#### (c)   False entries in WWF’s GST F5 returns

15     WWF became GST-registered on 24 June 2002 under the voluntary registration scheme. The declarant for the company’s GST registration form was the defendant, whose designation was stated as “Director”. The company elected to file its GST returns (the “**GST F5 returns**”) on a _quarterly_ basis. [^6]

16     Over five accounting periods between 2006 and 2008, the GST F5 returns filed by WWF contained false entries.[^7] The false entries were contained in two rows of the GST F5 returns:

> (a)     row 7 (“Input tax and refunds claimed”); and

> (b)     row 8 (“Net GST to be paid to IRAS” or “Net GST to be claimed from IRAS”).

17     This led to: (a) the undercharging of GST payable to the Comptroller; or (b) an excess net GST being claimed from the Comptroller. The relevant accounting periods (the “**Relevant Periods**”), the dates on which the GST F5 returns were filed, and the amount of tax involved are summarised in the following table:

18     Ms Yong, a Senior Tax Auditor with the GST Division of IRAS (referred to at \[11(a)\], above), conducted an audit on WWF’s GST F5 returns. The audit was done for the accounting periods from the second quarter of 2006 (period ended 30 June 2006) to the third quarter of 2007 (period ended 30 September 2007) (the “**Audit Period**”). During the audit process, she liaised with the defendant to obtain WWF’s sales listings (to support its output tax figures) and purchases listings (to support its input tax claims) in respect of the GST F5 returns.[^8]

19     Ms Tan, a Senior Tax Investigator with IRAS (referred to at \[11(b)\], above) was subsequently assigned, in March 2008, to assist Ms Yong in the matter. She undertook an investigation to ascertain whether any criminal offences had been committed, as WWF was suspected of having made fictitious GST refund claims. Ms Tan sought documents from the company relating to the Audit Period as well as further documents relating to other accounting periods, including the fourth quarter of 2007 (period ended 31 December 2007) and the first quarter of 2008 (period ended 31 March 2008). (The entire period from the second quarter of 2006 to the first quarter of 2008 will be referred to as the “**Investigation Period**”). Throughout the investigations into WWF, Ms Tan liaised mainly with the defendant. [^9]

20     The defendant furnished documents to IRAS relating to WWF’s sales and purchase listings, and provided tax invoices that were purportedly issued to WWF, but a significant number of discrepancies were found.[^10] Among other things, there were tax invoices _purportedly_ from the following entities: Singnan, Cathay Building and Kian An (referred to at \[12(a)\]-\[12(c)\], above). Ms Tan wrote to these entities to verify the purported transactions with WWF. It was found that Singnan, Cathay Building and Kian An had not made any sales to WWF – the tax invoices bearing the date and invoices numbers (as provided by the defendant) had not been issued to WWF.[^11] These were confirmed by the evidence of the representatives from Singnan, Cathay Building and Kian An.[^12]

21     Having reviewed the documents furnished by the defendant, and the replies from WWF’s suppliers and customers, it was found that there was a vast disparity in the amount of gross purchases reported in WWF’s GST F5 returns and the actual amount that was supported by valid documents. The disparities are summarised in the following table:[^13]

(The defendant did not dispute the accuracy of these figures.[^14])

22     Ms Tan ascertained the amount of input tax claims that WWF was in fact entitled to, against the amounts it had claimed in its GST F5 returns for the Relevant Periods. The outcome of Ms Tan’s review is reproduced in the following table:[^15]

#### (d)   Offences committed by WWF

23     Accordingly, WWF’s GST F5 returns for the Relevant Periods contained false entries. The prosecution relied on the presumption under s 62(2) of the GST Act (reproduced at \[9\], above) that when it has been proved that any false entry has been made in any return, there is a (rebuttable) presumption that the false entry was made _with intent to evade tax_. Making any false entry in any return under the GST Act with the intent to evade tax is an offence under s 62(1)(b) of the Act.

#### (e)   Defendant guilty as a manager of WWF

24     The prosecution further relied on the presumption under s 74(1) of the GST Act (reproduced at \[10\], above). Given that the defendant was a manager of WWF at the material time, he was deemed to be guilty of the offences committed by the company unless he proved that: (a) the offences were committed without his consent or connivance; _and_ (b) he exercised all such diligence to prevent the commission of the offences as he ought to have exercised, having regard to the nature of his functions in that capacity and to all the circumstances.

#### Defence

25     The prosecution having established a prima facie case against the defendant, the defendant was called upon to enter his defence. He elected to testify.

26     The crux of the defence was that the defendant was a young man unfamiliar with business and accounts. It was his adopted sister Ms Loon Cheng Yee (“**Ms Loon**”) who was responsible for the financial matters of the company.

> (a)     In respect of the first four charges, Ms Loon was the person responsible for filing the GST F5 returns. The defendant was not involved. He did not know, or could have reasonably known, that false entries had been made in the GST F5 returns at the time they were submitted.

> (b)     In respect of the fifth charge, the defendant had to prepare and submit the GST F5 returns as Ms Loon had left the company. But he was not familiar with accounting and GST matters. The errors in the returns were an honest mistake.

#### (a)   First four charges – no involvement in filing GST F5 returns

27     The defence to the first four charges was that the defendant was not involved in the submission of the GST F5 returns.

28     The defendant testified that he joined WWF as a director in 2002 (or 2003). He resigned as director in 2004 due to some disagreements with his mother (who was the other director) and his adopted sister (Ms Loon) on how the company should be managed. Nevertheless he remained in the company and continued to do business development, mainly outside the country.[^16]

29     According to the defendant, Ms Loon joined WWF in July 2003 and left the company in September 2007. She was appointed as the chief technical officer of the company and was responsible for financial administration, financial control, including GST reporting. She took charge of the “finance function” of the company from its former finance manager in December 2005. Ms Loon alone handled WWF’s accounts and GST filings between 2005 and 2007. It was her responsibility to file the GST F5 returns. She was the most qualified person in the company to do so. She was 12 years older than him, and had the trust and respect of their mother. Prior to joining WWF, she had 17 years’ experience working at a number of banks and a consulting firm.[^17]

30     The defendant was not the declarant on any of the GST F5 forms during the Relevant Periods. The person who had signed as the declarant on each form was his mother Ong Luan Choo (“OLC”). His participation was limited to that of a contact person on two of the forms. The declarant and contact person listed on each of the GST F5 forms during the Relevant Periods are summarised in the table below:

31     The defendant said that he had various disagreements with Ms Loon over work matters from 2003 to 2007. He did ask her to show him how she arrived at the figures for the GST F5 returns, but she would throw things at him or complain to their mother about him. As a result, he stopped checking her work on GST matters.[^18]

#### (b)   Fifth charge – honest mistake

32     In respect of the fifth charge, the defendant testified that he was “not … accounts trained”. But he had to prepare and submit the GST F5 return as Ms Loon had left the company (in September 2007). The company was unable to locate the listings she had prepared, and he was forced to “_reconstruct_” the listings based on whatever documents he could find. He had relied on _pro forma_ invoices as he did not realise the difference between a pro forma invoice and a tax invoice. He only understood that a pro forma invoice was not valid for the purposes of claiming input tax after being advised by IRAS. On 11 March 2008 he attended at the Revenue House to submit several invoices requested by IRAS. He attended a meeting with IRAS officers where it was communicated to him that IRAS “will adjust the figures”. Following that meeting, he sent an email to IRAS on 14 March 2008 in which he sought clarifications, with the view that “\[...\] those submission that was wrongfully included will be reversed out.”[^19] He had the impression that when he gave the listings to IRAS, they would help him to remove the items that were incorrect.[^20]

#### Issues before the court

33     On the evidence, it was not in dispute that:

> (a)     false entries had been made in the GST F5 returns of the company WWF for the Relevant Periods, which resulted in GST being undercharged or an excess net GST being claimed for those periods (summarised at \[17\], above).

> (b)     Under s 62(2) of the GST Act, where such false returns are made, it is presumed until the contrary is proved that the false entries in the returns were made with intent to evade tax. The wilful making of false entries with the intent to evade tax is an offence under s 62(1)(b) of the GST Act (relevant provisions reproduced at \[8\]-\[9\], above).

> (c)     The defendant was acting in the capacity of a “manager” and Vice-President of WWF at the material times. Under s 74(1) of the GST Act, he is deemed to be guilty of that offence unless he proves that — (a) the offence was committed without his consent or connivance; and (b) he exercised all such diligence to prevent the commission of the offence as he ought to have exercised, having regard to the nature of his functions in that capacity and to all the circumstances (relevant provisions reproduced at \[10\], above).

34     The key issue before the court was whether the defendant had rebutted the statutory presumptions in s 62(2) and s 74(1) of the GST Act on a balance of probabilities.

#### Decision

#### (a)   Whether defendant had consented or connived (first four charges)

35     In respect of the first four charges, a key issue was whether the defendant had consented to or connived in the offences committed by WWF.

36     The meaning of the words “consent” and “connive” were considered by the High Court in _Abdul Ghani bin Tahir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 125</span> (“**_Abdul Ghani_**”) at \[99\]-\[100\]:

> 99    \[...\] there is also a fine difference in culpability between “consent” and “connivance” under English law – **_consent_** requires more explicit an agreement for the illegal conduct to take place. In _Huckerby v Elliot_ \[1970\] 1 All ER 189, although the Divisional Court was essentially concerned with whether the appellant had committed an offence by reason of her neglect, Ashworth J noted that a fellow director of the company had pleaded guilty to a charge under the “consent” limb. In this connection, he expressed his approval for the following remarks which had featured in the magistrate’s judgment from whose decision the appeal arose (at 194):

>> It would seem that where a director **_consents_** to the commission of an offence by his company, he is well aware of what is going on and agrees to it … Where he **_connives_** at the offence committed by the company he is equally well aware of what is going on but his agreement is tacit, not actively encouraging what happens but letting it continue and saying nothing about it.

> 100    In _Attorney General’s Reference (No 1 of 1995)_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 WLR 970</span>, the English Court of Appeal was asked to answer the question as to what was required to be proved against a director to show “consent”. Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ concluded that a director must be shown to have known the material facts that constituted the offence by the body corporate and to have agreed to its conduct of the business on the basis of those facts (at 981). Subsequently, Lord Hope in _Chargot_ \[...\] endorsed this test, adding that consent can be established by either inference or proof of an express agreement (at \[34\]).

\[Emphasis in **_bold and italics_** added\]

37     The prosecution submitted that the defendant had consented to the offences committed by WWF. He was the person who solicited for business and procured supplies for the company. He had access to the company’s DBS bank account and the authority to jointly sign off on cheques issued by the company. The account balance in the company’s bank account for the Relevant Periods was relatively low, and the company was not in a financial position to incur large gross purchases ranging from some $65,084.00 (in 2006 Q1) to $806,200.00 (in 2007 Q2).[^21] The substantial amounts of GST refunds ranging from $2,704.20 (for 2006 Q1) to $36,010.00 (for 2007 Q2) paid by the Comptroller into the company’s bank account[^22] would have alerted the defendant to the fact that these were wrongly credited. These amounts far exceeded the account balances in the company’s bank account at the respective dates.[^23] The defendant withdrew large amounts from the company’s bank account via ATM withdrawals, Business Advance Card transactions and cash cheques shortly after the quarterly crediting of the GST refunds.[^24] It was submitted that through these actions, it could be inferred that the defendant _consented to_ the criminal conduct that led to the claiming of fraudulent GST refunds from the Comptroller. He not merely agreed to it, but even partook in them by withdrawing and using the illegal gains. It was further submitted that, in the alternative, he had at the very least _connived in_ the offences.

38     The defence submitted that the defendant had neither consented nor connived in the commission of the offences. The defendant’s testimony was that WWF did not regularly deposit its monies into its bank account; there was a financial arrangement between their mother and Ms Loon, which he was not completely aware of, in which the company’s monies would be kept in Ms Loon’s accounts or in other accounts.[^25] As such, the defendant could not have reasonably known what the state of WWF’s bank account was and whether it was in a position to qualify for the GST refunds that were being credited to the company. The IRAS investigator Ms Tan conceded, under cross-examination, that her investigations did _not_ show that the defendant was _personally_ aware of the circumstances leading to the deposit of the GST refunds.[^26] It was also submitted that various factors came into play as to how businesses manage cash flow and deposit their money, such as the company’s credit terms and its internal practices for keeping cash. Figures in a company’s bank account may not tally with their declared supplies or deposits for various reasons, including the company’s sales cycle, credit terms and cash payments. Ms Tan had conceded that she did not clarify with the company what their credit terms were, she did not check with the defendant whether cash had been kept or deposited when it was received.[^27] It was submitted that it was fallacious and commercially implausible to assume that all declared taxable purchases and suppliers would be reflected in the company’s bank account during the relevant three-month GST period. Deposits and withdrawals from a bank account in a three-month period may not necessarily tally with the reported supplies and purchases in that period: the prosecution’s assumption that bank statements must reflect the taxable purchases and supplies declared by a company was unfounded. It was also submitted that the cashing out of cheques by the defendant was a neutral fact because it did not show that he actually spent the monies that were cashed out on personal expenses; his evidence was that the monies were kept by Ms Loon.

39     I accepted the submission of the defence that the evidence did not show that the defendant had consented to or connived in the offences committed by WWF. His testimony, that much of the monies of the company was not kept in the company’s bank account, was not implausible. For a small family-run business such as WWF, it was conceivable that not all the cash received by the company would be deposited into the company’s bank account. Hence it could not be reasonably inferred that from the state of the company’s bank account that the defendant would be in a position to know whether the company qualified for the GST refunds that were being credited to the account. In fact, as was highlighted by the defence, the investigations conducted by Ms Tan did not show that the defendant was _personally_ aware of the circumstances leading to the deposit of the GST refunds. While the prosecution had stated in its Opening Address (PS1) that evidence would be led from Ms Loon to show that the defendant “had instructed her to fill in the relevant GST F5 returns” for the Relevant Periods with false entries, Ms Loon was subsequently _not_ called as a witness.

40     Thus, in respect of the first four charges, the evidence did not prove that the defendant was _aware_ of the false entries in the GST F5 returns, such that he could be said to have consented to or connived in the submission of the false returns by the company. I found that the defence had proven on a balance of probabilities that the defendant had not consented to or connived in the offences by the company.

#### (b)   Whether defendant had exercised diligence (first four charges)

41     The prosecution submitted that the defendant had not exercised diligence to prevent the commission of the offences. He was intimately involved in the running of the family-owned company. He was responsible for its sales and purchases, and had joint authority over its bank account along with his mother. He had, in his capacity as a director, voluntarily registered WWF for GST in 2002. He was the declarant for the company’s GST F5 returns for the periods ended 30 June 2002 to 30 June 2003, 30 June 2004 to 31 March 2005 and 30 September 2005 (prior to the Relevant Periods for the present charges).[^28] He thus had some knowledge and familiarity in the filing of GST returns from the year 2002. He had been advised by his accountant on the need for tax invoices to be kept.[^29] Hence he must have been aware of the company’s obligations as a GST-registered business in the filing of its GST F5 returns. As a manager, he was expected to institute a system to ensure that GST returns were filed with the Comptroller accurately and on a timely basis, with appropriate safeguards in place for checks and balances. WWF was a closely-held family business, and the defendant could not have been unaware of the workings of the company. It was incumbent on him to take the necessary steps to prevent GST fraud from occurring.

42     The defence submitted that given the nature of his role in the company and his (difficult) relationship with his sister Ms Loon, he had exercised all such diligence possible in the circumstances; it was impossible for him to have exercised any further diligence in supervising her. Even though he was part of the senior management of the company, he was not in charge of finance or filing the GST F5 returns. Section 74(1)(b) of the GST Act provides that a person in the capacity of a director or manager must prove that he exercised diligence “_having regard to the nature of his functions in that capacity_”. It was submitted that not all directors, managers, officers and secretaries must face criminal liability for a completely separate department performing unrelated functions in the company. In the defendant’s capacity as a marketing and business development manager, it was unreasonable to expect him to exercise due diligence in the area of financial administration when he was entitled to entrust the matter to his sister. There was no reason for him to be put on notice that anything was amiss. There can be no failure on the defendant’s part to exercise diligence in an area in which he was not required to concern himself.

43     In my judgement, it was implausible that, as a member of the senior management of WWF—which was a small family-run company—the defendant had no involvement or responsibility in the filing of the GST F5 returns. The defendant, together with his mother and sister, were at the material times responsible for the affairs of the company. In such a small setup, it was hardly conceivable that there was such a clear demarcation of roles that the defendant was completely uninvolved in the process of filing the GST F5 returns, and that the matter was left entirely to his sister. This was particularly so, considering that it was the defendant who registered WWF for GST in 2002, and he was the declarant for a number of the company’s GST F5 returns in the period from 2002 to 2005. His claim to being ignorant about GST matters was not credible at all.

44     In this regard, I found the defendant to have been _not_ entirely truthful in his testimony about his role in the company and in the filing of the GST F5 returns. There were material inconsistencies between his testimony in court and the statements recorded from him.

> (a)     In his statement dated 8 October 2008, he stated that he was “_in charge_ in procuring sales and making purchases for \[WWF\]”.[^30] When cross-examined at the trial, he downplayed his role by saying that he did not make purchases on WWF’s behalf, but he only _recommended_ to his mother what purchases were needed, and she would defer to Ms Loon on whether those purchases should be made.[^31]

> (b)     In respect of the filing of GST F5 returns, in his statement dated 18 April 2011, he stated that he had completed the GST returns in 2002 to 2005 based on the figures prepared by Ms Loon _without verifying_ these figures.[^32] When cross-examined at the trial, he said that she would give him her workings on a piece of paper and a file with supporting documents, and _he would check through some of the invoices, and counter check against the major supplies_.[^33] During re-examination, he said that he had tried to do due diligence by asking Ms Loon to show him the workings, but when he probed she would throw things at him or complain to their mother about him; as a result, he _stopped questioning her_.[^34]

45     At the trial the defendant was plainly seeking to downplay his role in WWF, particularly in the filing of the company’s GST F5 returns, even as he sought to push the responsibility and blame to Ms Loon. His evidence on whether he had checked the figures in the GST F5 returns prepared by Ms Loon was inconsistent (summarised at \[44(b)\], above). I found it highly doubtful that he checked those figures. There was a vast disparity in the amount of purchases reported in WWF’s GST F5 returns and the actual amount that was supported by valid supporting documents (summarised in the table at \[21\], above). If it had been his practice to check the major supplies (which he claimed he did under cross-examination), it was inconceivable that there would have been such a vast disparity between the company’s reported and actual GST figures over so many accounting periods. Conversely, if he had stopped checking the figures (as he said during re-examination) and simply disengaged from the process, then it could hardly be said that he had exercised diligence to prevent the filing of the false GST F5 returns during the Relevant Periods. His claim that he stopped checking the figures because of his difficult relationship with Ms Loon was not mentioned in the statements that he gave in 2008 and 2011, and was uncorroborated. In my judgment, it was no more than an afterthought, and could not be believed.

46     On the evidence, therefore, I was not persuaded that the defendant had exercised due diligence in the matter. The statutory presumption in s 74(1) of the GST Act had not been rebutted by the defence. I found that the defendant was guilty, as a manager of WWF, for the offences committed by the company. Accordingly, the defendant was found guilty and convicted on the first four charges.

#### (c)   Fifth charge

47     In respect of the fifth charge, it was undisputed that the defendant himself completed the GST F5 return for the accounting period ended 31 March 2008.

48     The defence submitted that the “errors” were an honest mistake made without any intention of evading or assisting WWF to evade tax. The defendant was a young person who suddenly found himself saddled with the responsibility of regularising his company’s tax filings (after Ms Loon left the company in September 2007). He was unfamiliar with the formal requirements for GST filings. He was relying on the IRAS officers to guide him as to what he needed to do in order to verify and justify the company’s tax filings. He was operating under the misplaced assumption that the IRAS officers were going to help him regularise his company’s tax filings. It was further submitted by the defence that it was highly unlikely that the defendant would have attempted to cheat IRAS. By that time when the GST F5 return was submitted (in April 2008), WWF had already been under an audit investigation for about five months. The audit had been made known to the defendant when IRAS wrote to the company on 15 November 2007 requesting for information on the business of the company, as well as the sales and purchase listings for the periods ending 30 June 2006 to 30 September 2007.[^35] The severity of the situation would have been abundantly clear to the defendant, since the company’s bank account had been frozen, and travel restrictions had been imposed on him and his parents.[^36] Between December 2007 and March 2008, emails were exchanged between the defendant and IRAS in which IRAS continued to ask for more listings and original documents to support the company’s input tax claims.[^37] This meant that by April 2008, the defendant was already in the midst of an arduous project to piece together and “reconstruct” the listings for the earlier GST submissions. It was submitted that the defendant simply had no idea what he was doing, but was trying his best to meet the IRAS’s requests.

49     The prosecution submitted that if the defendant had entertained any doubts, he ought to have exercised due diligence by clarifying the matter with IRAS _before_ submitting the GST F5 return. The GST F5 return[^38] contained a declaration that the information given was “true and complete”. The defendant could not simply assume that IRAS would help him to correct the incorrect items in the listings. The defendant was aware of the importance of issuing _tax invoices_ for GST purposes,[^39] yet he proceeded to claim input tax indicated on _pro forma_ invoices (which were essentially quotations).

50     I agreed with the submission of the prosecution, and rejected the submission of the defence that the false entries in the GST F5 return were an honest mistake. This was not the first time that the defendant was being involved in the filing of a GST F5 return. He had done so as a declarant for a number of accounting periods from 2002 to 2005.[^40] In fact it was he who voluntarily registered the company for GST in 2002. His claim to ignorance was unconvincing. Regardless, it was incumbent upon him to ensure that the GST F5 returns were properly and accurately filed. He ought to have acquired the relevant knowledge and information to do so. It was not open to him simply to file a GST F5 return willy-nilly, expecting IRAS to correct any mistakes. Such an approach was completely antithetical to the exercise of diligence. There was a vast disparity between the value of taxable purchases reported in the GST F5 return ($643,014.02) and the value of taxable purchases supported by valid documents ($12,371.65) (above, at \[21\]). This disparity, in my judgment, could not simply be attributable to a mistake; it was suggestive of an attempt to overclaim GST refunds. In this regard I was not persuaded by the submission of the defence that the defendant was highly unlikely to have attempted to evade tax as the company was undergoing an audit by IRAS: it is, unfortunately, not uncommon that an offender reoffends while being investigated for prior offences, and even after having been charged in court.

51     Therefore, I found that the defence had not rebutted the presumption under s 62(2) of the GST Act, that the false entries in the GST F5 return had been made with the intent to evade tax. Further, under s 74(1) of the GST Act, the defendant, as a manager of the company, was deemed guilty of the offence. This was a presumption that clearly had not been rebutted on the evidence.

52     Accordingly, the defendant was also found guilty and convicted on the fifth charge.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

54     The prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 36 weeks’ imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was liable to pay a penalty of three times the amount of GST which had or would have been undercharged, under s 48 of the GST Act. The sentencing position of the prosecution is summarised in the following table:

55     It was submitted that the main sentencing consideration was deterrence. General deterrence is necessary where a public institution is a victim of fraud. GST is a self-assessed tax, where the taxpayer voluntarily self-declares and files the GST F5 returns without the need to file any documents to support the figures. It is a system based on trust. Any abuse of that trust should be viewed as an aggravating factor. The evasion of tax is difficult to detect. It was due to the diligence of IRAS’ auditors that the present offences were uncovered. Tax evasion is tantamount to a deliberate and pre-meditated fraud committed on the State and must be deterred.

56     It was also submitted that specific deterrence was applicable. The present offences were not an impulsive act, but a deliberate and systemic fraud repeatedly committed on the State over a period of two years from 2006 to 2008. The defendant also had antecedents a mere two years before the commission of the present offences which involved elements of dishonesty.

57     It was further submitted by the prosecution that the defendant had personally benefitted from the proceeds of the crime, and that he had used a proportion of the GST refunds for personal expenses. He did not show any remorse for the offences and attempted to deflect responsibility to his sister, Ms Loon. He repeatedly pushed the blame for all GST and financial matters to her.[^41] No restitution had been made by the defendant of the GST refunds wrongfully obtained.

#### Mitigation plea

58     The defence submitted that the sentence ought to be a fine. If a custodial sentence was imposed, the sentence ought to be at most 3 weeks’ imprisonment per charge; the sentences for the first four charges ought to run concurrently as they were multiple occurrences of the same offence, namely, failing to exercise due diligence in supervising his sister.

59     It was submitted that the defendant’s role was primarily in business development and marketing. In respect of the first four charges, the defendant did not exercise actual control over the company’s finance department, and he did not prepare or file the GST F5 returns. In respect of the fifth charge, the obligation to file the GST F5 returns fell upon the defendant’s shoulders after Ms Loon left the company and his mother had fallen ill. He thus prepared the GST F5 return without any prior experience. It was submitted that there was a low chance of the defendant re-offending. He had stayed crime-free over the long period of the investigations. He had made contributions to various social and charitable causes. It was submitted that the defendant’s antecedents were dissimilar and minimal weight should be placed on them. It was further submitted that there had been a delay in the prosecution of the matter, which ought to be taken into account in sentencing.

#### Sentencing considerations

#### (a)   Sentencing objective

60     In deciding upon the appropriate sentence, I accepted the submission of the prosecution that the primary sentencing objective was deterrence. Any fraud committed against a public institution must be deterred. With reference to the present case, there was a clear public interest to protect the integrity of the trust-based GST system. Any act that abuses or has the potential to undermine the system must be met with a deterrent sentence.

61     The objective of deterrence is reflected in the heavy punishments prescribed for offences relating to GST fraud. The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 62(1)(b) read with s 74(1) of the GST Act (at the time when the present offences were committed) was a penalty of three times the amount of GST that had been or would have been undercharged, and a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both.

#### (b)   Defendant’s culpability compared with his sister, Ms Loon

62     The prosecution informed that there have been no known cases prosecuted under s 62(1) _read with s 74(1)_ of the GST Act. It was submitted that although offences under s 62(1) of the GST Act have a higher _mens rea_ threshold (wilful intent to evade tax) compared to offences under s 62(1) read with s 74(1) GST Act (being the consent, connivance or failure to exercise diligence to prevent the s 62(1) offence), the culpability of the defendant was akin to and similar to that for s 62(1) offences. It was emphasised that WWF was a small family-run company and the defendant was part of the senior management of the company; it was unlikely that the defendant had no involvement in the offences relating to the filing of the company’s GST F5 returns. Furthermore, under s 74(1) of the GST Act, the defendant is “_deemed_ to be guilty” of the offence under s 62(1) itself. Therefore, offences under s 62(1) shared parity with offences under s 62(1) read with s 74(1).

63     Ms Loon had pleaded guilty (on 17 February 2017) to two charges under s 62(1)(b) of the GST Act, with two other charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The four charges mirrored the first four charges against the defendant. The two proceeded charges against Ms Loon mirrored the present second and third charges. She was sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment and 3 weeks’ imprisonment respectively, with both sentences ordered to run consecutively giving a total of 5 weeks’ imprisonment. It was submitted by the prosecution that the defendant was significantly more culpable than Ms Loon, given his control of WWF’s business and his participation in the senior management. It was also submitted that the defendant had personally benefitted from the proceeds of the crimes while Ms Loon had not.

64     The defence submitted that the defendant’s culpability (if any and as found by the court), was lower than Ms Loon’s. In respect of the first four charges, the defendant was not personally involved in the submission of the GST F5 returns, and it was Ms Loon who had handled the company’s accounts and GST filings. Even taking into account the fact that the defendant had claimed trial, the length of the sentence imposed on him should not exceed that of Ms Loon. His culpability pertained to his _ex officio_ failure to exercise due diligence during the period of time that Ms Loon controlled the company’s finances.

65     Having considered the evidence before me, it was my judgement that the defendant’s culpability was _comparable_ to that of Ms Loon. I did not accept the prosecution’s submission that the defendant was significantly more culpable than Ms Loon. The reasons are elaborated below.

#### (c)   Whether defendant had personally benefitted from the GST refunds

66     The main premise on which the prosecution sought a higher sentence for the defendant, compared with Ms Loon, was that he had personally benefitted from the wrongful GST refunds _while she had not_. I did not find this premise to be supported on the evidence.

67     It was the prosecution’s contention that the defendant had used a proportion of the GST refunds credited into the bank account of WWF for his personal expenses.[^42] This was based on a number of observations. The defendant’s signature was found on all 44 of the cheques issued by WWF for the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 March 2008. His name was on the back of several _cash_ cheques, indicating that he had encashed them. Three of the transactions on the Business Advance Card issued to WWF appeared to be for personal expenses, namely, the transactions in respect of “www.loversguide”, “Condomania”, and “Hot Spa Pte Ltd”.

68     The defence submitted that the defendant did not personally benefit from the GST refunds. The defendant’s signature would have had to be on all of the cheques issued by WWF, as he was the co-signatory for the company along with his mother. His evidence was that either he or his mother would help to cash out cheques and pass the cash to Ms Loon for safe-keeping. He shared the Business Advance Card (a corporate ATM card) with every member of his family, who were also officers of the company. The expenses, such as his overseas transactions, were business expenses and not personal expenses. There was no evidence to show that the expenses were personal expenses incurred by him.[^43]

69     In my judgment, the evidence adduced did not prove the prosecution’s assertion that the defendant had personally benefitted from the GST refunds while Ms Loon had not. The fact that cheques were encashed by the defendant and that expenses were incurred on the Business Advance Card did not lead to the conclusion that they were solely for his personal expenses. They were at best a suspicion or conjecture, which did not amount to proof. The defendant’s evidence that the cash withdrawn was handed to Ms Loon, and that the transactions on the Business Advance Card were business expenses were not implausible. The prosecution called no witness to rebut that evidence.

#### (d)   Whether there had been inordinate delay in the prosecution

70     The defence submitted that there had been an inordinate delay in the proceedings. The present charges related to events that occurred between 2006 and 2008. Investigations into WWF began in or around March 2008. Charges were tendered against the defendant on 15 September 2015, and the trial was held only in 2018. During this period the defendant had suffered undue agony, stress and anxiety arising from having the matter hanging over his head for an extended period of time. Since 2005, the defendant had suffered from depression and insomnia. As a result of the anxiety occasioned by the investigations, he began exhibiting depressive symptoms again in 2012 and received psychiatric treatment.[^44] The defence submitted that the delay should be taken into account in sentencing.

71     The prosecution disputed that there had been inordinate delay in the matter. It was submitted that tax investigations were unique, and tax offences required time to identify and investigate before criminal proceedings were initiated. After IRAS commenced the audit of WWF in November 2007, there was a series of correspondence between the auditor Ms Yong and the defendant. IRAS received incomplete documentation from the defendant and conflicting information from WWF’s suppliers. It was suspected that WWF had been making fictitious GST claims, and the matter was referred for investigation in July 2008.[^45] These were substantive investigations involving not one, but three persons (the defendant, his mother, and his sister). Considerable time was taken to determine their respective roles and responsibilities in WWF; conflicting statements were given by their counsel on their roles and responsibilities, all of which had to be investigated and verified. There were numerous delays by the defendant in providing the supplies and purchase listings and supporting documents to support the GST F5 returns of the company. He asked for numerous extensions of time to produce the documents requested by IRAS. Time was also taken to verify with the numerous suppliers and sales invoices of the company. Following the conclusion of the investigations, which were long drawn due to delays caused by the defendant, the matter was referred to the IRAS Law Division. Charges were filed against the defendant, his mother and Ms Loon on 15 September 2015.

72     The prosecution also explained the delay in the start of the present trial. At the second pre-trial conference (“PTC”) on 17 June 2016, counsel for all three co-defendants (as they then were) informed the court of their objections to a joint trial. A hearing date was taken for a court to hear submissions by parties on the matter. After three further PTCs and on the hearing date that was fixed on 3 November 2016 to hear the objections, counsel for all three informed the court that they were no longer objecting to a joint trial. The matter against the defendant’s mother was adjourned six times for her to obtain three different medical reports on her fitness to stand trial. Each adjournment was lengthy as it involved the preparation and consideration of the medical reports. The defendant similarly sought adjournments for his matter, saying that his position would be dependent on the outcome of his mother’s medical reports. Further, since the commencement of the proceedings against him, the defendant had appointed several different counsel. He had sought repeated adjournments to appoint new counsel, and the newly appointed counsel requested for adjournments to take instructions. It was submitted that the delays in the investigations and prosecution were occasioned primarily by the defendant himself. He had also not shown that any prejudice had been caused to him by the delay.

73     I accepted the submission of the prosecution. In the circumstances, given the complexity of the matter and the significant amount of time and effort required in the investigation, I did not find that there had been undue delay in the prosecution of the case. The defendant’s actions had contributed to the delay in bringing this matter to trial. While the defendant may have experienced some anxiety and depression from the pending case, the circumstances were not so exceptional as to warrant a reduction in the sentence.

#### (e)   Appropriate sentence

74     The principal justification put forth by the prosecution in seeking a much higher sentence for the defendant (36 weeks’ imprisonment) compared with Ms Loon (who received 5 weeks’ imprisonment) was that the defendant had benefitted from the payouts of the GST refunds, while Ms Loon had not. Having considered the evidence, I did not find that this assertion had been proven (discussed at \[66\]-\[69\], above).

75     That said, I found it implausible that the defendant had not benefitted at all, whether directly or indirectly, from the payout of the GST refunds. This was implausible given that it was a small family business managed essentially by the defendant, Ms Loon and their mother. It was however unclear from the evidence the _extent_ to which each person had benefitted from the GST refunds.

76     In any case, the law imposes on directors, managers and similar officers of companies the duty to ensure that the GST returns are properly filed. The law imposes the same liability and prescribes the same punishment in the event of fraudulent claims being made. _Prima facie_ therefore, the director or manager is equally culpable as the officer in the company who actually filed the GST return, unless there are cogent reasons to distinguish and differentiate their culpability.

77     For the present charges, it was my judgment that the defendant’s culpability was somewhat similar to Ms Loon’s (in respect of each of the first four charges). While Ms Loon was directly responsible for filing the GST F5 returns, the defendant could not simply seek to limit his culpability by claiming that he was not involved at all. The fact was that he was a manager of the company – indeed, a member of the senior management – and must equally be held to account for its lapses.

78     In respect of the fifth charge, there was no question that it was the defendant himself who filled in the details of the GST F5 return. He failed to exercise any diligence in the matter, considering the vast disparity between the value of taxable purchases reported in the GST F5 return ($643,014.02) and the value of taxable purchases supported by valid documents ($12,371.65). I did not accept that this was attributable to a lack of experience in such matters. (discussed at \[50\], above)

79     In deciding on the appropriate sentence, I took into account the fact that, unlike Ms Loon who had pleaded guilty to her charges, the defendant disputed all the charges and has refused to accept responsibility and has shown no remorse for the fraud committed by the company. I also noted that while Ms Loon had no prior convictions, the defendant had antecedents (which included the use of forged documents) for which some weight ought to be given.

80     Considering the amount of GST involved in each of the offences, which was not insignificant, and the sentencing objective of deterrence, it was my judgement that the custodial threshold had been crossed for all the offences. Having regard to the sentences imposed on Ms Loon, I considered it appropriate for the present offences to impose imprisonment terms of between one to 3 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, with the length of the imprisonment term varying according to the amount of GST involved. In addition, the defendant would be required to pay the prescribed penalty of three times the total tax that had been or would have been undercharged.

81     I also considered it appropriate that three sentences be ordered to run consecutively to reflect the overall culpability of the defendant. This would give a total sentence higher than that received by Ms Loon. Five charges were proceeded against the defendant at the trial, compared with the two charges to which Ms Loon pleaded guilty. Apart from the first four charges (which were mirror charges faced by Ms Loon), the defendant was guilty of the additional offence in the fifth charge. The defendant’s overall culpability was therefore higher and ought to be reflected in a correspondingly higher total sentence.
