### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## Introduction

1       The Defendant company, Koon Seng Investments Pte Ltd (“the Company”), claimed trial to seven charges under section 32A(1)(_a_) of the Street Works Act (Cap 320A, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) for causing “to display potted plants at the carriageway on the public street at Ah Soo Garden in front of No. 31 Ah Soo Garden”, thereby creating obstruction or inconvenience to road users on the street. The offences were alleged to have been committed on 7 June, 1 August, 12 September, 22 October, 19 November and 5 December 2018, and 16 January 2019. There was a remaining charge against the Company that was stood down.

2       The Company’s representative was Mr Toh Tian Hock, who was the Managing Director of the Company. The Company was not represented by counsel.

3       The Prosecution closed its case on 6 August 2020. On 1 October 2020, I found that the Prosecution had failed to make out a case against the Company on the seven charges, and the Company was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal. A pre-trial conference was fixed for remaining charge.

4       The Prosecution filed an appeal against the acquittal. I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The Prosecution’s case

5       The Prosecution called four witnesses for its case, two officers from the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) and two officers from the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”):

> (i)     Muhammad Afiq Zainuddin, a Senior Principal Enforcement Officer from the LTA;

> (ii)     Tan Puay Joo, a Deputy Director from the SLA;

> (iii)     Mohd Rashid Noor, an Assistant Manager from the SLA; and

> (iv)     Jamaludin Othman, a LTA Investigation Officer.

6       Through these witnesses, the Prosecution led evidence that 31 Ah Soo Garden (“No. 31”) was owned by the Company and the Company’s registered address was 23 Ah Soo Garden (“No. 23”). The Prosecution also adduced evidence to show that the area in front of No. 31 (“the Area”), where the potted plants were deposited, was state land[^1], and that on the days in question, there were potted plants deposited in the Area[^2].

7       It was not disputed that Mr Toh was residing at No. 31 with his family at all material times.

### The evidence of the SLA officers

8       Mdm Tan Puay Joo (“Mdm Tan”) (PW2), who was from the Land Sales and Transfer Division of the SLA, produced a certified plan of Ah Soo Garden (“the Plan”) (P17) and testified that No. 31 was indicated as Lot 7523 Mukim 22. Mdm Tan further testified that the Area outside No. 31 was Lot 7524N Mukim 22[^3], and explained that while the Area is reflected as Lot 7524 Mukim 22 in P17, Lot 7524 and Lot 7524N referred to the same land parcel.

9       Mdm Tan confirmed that Lot 7524N Mukim 22 was state land[^4] according to the SLA Lot Base System (P18). The Area was vested to the State pursuant to an application made by the LTA under the Act, and the instrument was subsequently lodged by the LTA on 26 June 2002 (P19).

10     The Prosecution also adduced evidence from Mr Mohd Rashid Noor (“Mr Rashid”) (PW3) from the Survey and Geomatics Division of the SLA. Mr Rashid gave evidence that the SLA embarked on a project between 1994 and 1996 to computerise its system. In the course of computerising its system, an alphabet was introduced to every lot number in every mukim. The alphabet is necessary if an applicant wishes to do an online search on a particular lot number[^5].

### The evidence of the LTA officers

11     To prove the Company’s connection to the potted plants, the Prosecution adduced evidence from two LTA officers, Mr Muhammad Afiq Zainuddin (“Mr Afiq”) (PW1), who was a Senior Principal Enforcement Officer, and IO Jamaludin Othman (“IO Jamaludin”) (PW4).

12     Mr Afiq testified that on 12 April 2018, he went to the Area and saw that there was “a potted plant on the public street”. He proceeded to take some photographs of the scene[^6] and “moved the potted plants to the side”[^7] before returning to his office. In the office, Mr Afiq did a check on OneMap (P2) to confirm that the Area was state land[^8]. A written advisory dated 12 April 2018 was then issued[^9].

13     On 7 June 2018, Mr Afiq returned to the Area, and observed that there were potted plants deposited in the Area. In the course of his work, Mr Afiq visited the Area on 1 August, 12 September, 22 October, 19 November and 5 December 2018, and 16 January 2019 again[^10]. He found potted plants deposited in the Area, causing obstruction and inconvenience to motorists and emergency vehicles.

14     Mr Afiq gave evidence that the potted plants caused obstruction and inconvenience as the road was a _cul-de-sac_ and motorists would “need to carefully manoeuvre their cars” when making u-turns[^11]. In addition, the potted plants would obstruct a fire engine from “accessing the fire hydrant which was located beside the potted plants”[^12].

15     Through his “investigations”, Mr Afiq found that the “offender’s name \[was\] Toh Tiam Hock, Koon Seng Investments Private Limited”[^13]. Mr Afiq explained that on 12 April 2018, upon his return to the office, he received a call from a male caller who “claimed that he was living at No. 31”[^14]. The male caller, whom Mr Afiq gathered to be “the owner” of the potted plants, questioned Mr Afiq and asked why Mr Afiq had shifted his (the owner’s) plants[^15].

16     Mr Afiq issued a total of seven Reports of Offence (the “Notices”) – the “Offender Name” for the Notices dated 8 June 2018 (P3), 1 August 2018 (P5), 12 September 2018 (P7), and 24 October 2018 (P9) was “Toh Tian Hock \_ Koon Seng Investments Pte Ltd”, while the ones dates 29 November 2018 (P11), 11 December 2018 (P13) and 18 January 2019 (P15) was “Koon Seng Investments Pte Ltd”.

17     The final witness called by the Prosecution was IO Jamaludin. IO Jamaludin was the Assistant Manager of the Road Asset Regulation and Licensing, Traffic and Road Operations Group. IO Jamaludin testified that he did a search on the business profile of the Company using a search engine of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”). The ACRA search report (P20) showed that the Company was a live company and the registered address of the Company was No. 23.

18     Other than the ACRA search report, the Prosecution adduced a Government Gazette published on 31 May 2002 (P21). According to the Government Gazette, Lot 7524 Mukim 22 was “set aside as street reserve” and would vest in the Government with effect from 31 May 2002.

19     In relation to the ownership of the potted plants, IO Jamaludin’s evidence was that Mr Afiq had established the “ownership of the potted plants with the domestic helper” at No. 31. The domestic helper had “admitted that the potted plants were placed \[there\] by her employer”[^16].

20     When asked by me why the LTA did not charge the person who placed the potted plants in the Area, IO Jamaludin’s reply was that “to generate the offender (_sic_) details in the notice of offence, we need particulars. And we \[could not\] get it anywhere (_sic_)”[^17]. Therefore, Mr Afiq proceeded to check with the Singapore Titles Automated Registration System and found that the Company was the owner of No. 31[^18].

## Close of Prosecution’s case

### The Defence’s submissions

21     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, Mr Toh submitted that the Company “had nothing to do with” the potted plants although it was the owner of No. 31, and it was the resident of No. 31 who had deposited the potted plants in the Area.

### The Prosecution’s submissions

22     At the close of its case, the Prosecution made an application under section 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) to amend the charges, alleging instead that the Company “did allow potted plants to be deposited” on the public street. The Prosecution submitted that the amendment came about based on the cross-examination of IO Jamaludin by the Defence.

23     The Prosecution further submitted that the Company knew that its director (Mr Toh) had deposited the potted plants along the road and took no steps to remove them. In addition, the Prosecution relied on the case of _Trade Facilities Pte Ltd & Ors v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 7</span> and submitted that the acts of Mr Toh could be attributed to the company and for the corporate veil to be lifted. The Prosecution highlighted the following points:

> (i)     the Notices were served on the Company by registered mail at No. 23 which was the registered address of the Company;

> (ii)     the Company was the owner of No. 31; and

> (iii)     the amendments, if allowed, would not be prejudicial to the Defence, as the Defence could be allowed to recall any of the witnesses.

## My decision

### The ingredients of the charges

24     In order to establish the charges against the Company, the Prosecution had to establish that:

> (a)     the Area where the potted plants were deposited was a public street;

> (b)     the potted plants created obstruction and inconvenience to road users; and

> (c)     the Company caused or allowed the potted plants to be deposited in the Area on the dates stated in the charges.

25     At the close of Prosecution’s case, the Prosecution needed only to establish a _prima facie_ case against the Company.

### The Area was a public street and the potted plants caused obstruction to road users

26     It was clear from the photographs[^19] taken by Mr Afiq that the potted plants were deposited on the road on the dates stated in the charges. I accepted the evidence of Mr Afiq and IO Jamaludin that the potted plants created obstruction and inconvenience to road users, including emergency vehicles. This was because the potted plants were placed in front of a fire hydrant and in addition, the Area was a _cul-de-sac_, and the potted plants would cause obstruction to drivers who were making u-turns in the Area.

27     I further accepted the evidence of Mdm Tan that the Area was state land. It was also clear from the Government Gazetted (P21) that the Area had been vested in the Government since 31 May 2002.

### The party that caused or allowed the potted plants to be deposited in the Area

28     I next considered whether the Company was responsible for causing the potted plants to be deposited there, or by allowing them to be so deposited. In this regard, I considered the issue of the lifting of the corporate veil, as submitted by the Prosecution. In my view, this issue of lifting the corporate veil applied to both the original charges and the proposed amended charges.

#### Lifting of corporate veil

29     In the present case, there was no evidence before me that Mr Toh had treated the Company as his own, and that Mr Toh was the mind and will behind the Company. Neither was there any evidence that what Mr Toh did was related to the ordinary course of business of the Company, or that the Company was operating any business from No. 31.

30     While it was submitted that the Notices were served on the Company at its registered address at No. 23, there was no evidence that this was so from either the oral testimony of Mr Afiq or IO Jamaludin. Even if I accepted that the Notices were served on the Company at its registered address, this alone was not sufficient to lift the corporate veil in the present case, based on the case of _Trade Facilities Pte Ltd & Ors v PP_[^20].

31     If the corporate veil was not lifted, there was nothing to attribute the acts of Mr Toh to the Company. In fact, the evidence of Mr Afiq suggested that Mr Toh had called the LTA and questioned why the LTA had removed his potted plants. There was no mention by Mr Toh that the potted plants belonged to the Company. More critically, in four of the Notices dated 8 June 2018 (P3), 1 August 2018 (P5), 12 September 2018 (P7), and 24 October 2018 (P9), Mr Toh was named as one of the offenders and it was also the evidence of IO Jamaludin that Mr Afiq had found out from the domestic helper at No. 31 that Mr Toh was living in No. 31 and the potted plants belonged to Mr Toh. In relation to the original charges therefore, the Prosecution failed to adduce any evidence to show that the Company had caused the potted plants to be deposited on the public street, and that Mr Toh had acted on behalf of the Company when he did so.

#### Amendment of charges

32     As for the proposed amended charges, the Company was alleged to know that Mr Toh had deposited the potted plants on the public road, and had not taken steps to remove them thereby allowing it to happen. In this regard, the Prosecution submitted that based on the proximity of No. 23 and No. 31, it could be reasonably inferred that the Company had knowledge of what Mr Toh did.

33     The proposed amendment does not solve the fundamental evidential problem. If the corporate veil was not lifted, there was equally no evidence adduced by the Prosecution to show that the Company had knowledge that Mr Toh had deposited the potted plants along the public street, and had allowed Mr Toh to do so on the dates specified in the charges. I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence to impute knowledge on the Company of Mr Toh’s actions based merely on the fact that No. 23 and No. 31 were proximate to each other, especially since there was no evidence that the Company was operating from No. 31. I note that, in the Act, the section in question does not place a duty on the owner of the property _per se_.

34     The Prosecution further submitted that the Company would have knowledge of Mr Toh’s acts when the Notices were served on it. Assuming that the Notices were served properly on the Company, at best, the Company would come to know of the illegally placed potted plants after the dates as stated in the Notices, which was _expo facto_ the event. This did not show that the Company had knowledge of the illegally placed potted plants on the dates stipulated and had failed to remove them, thereby allowing them to be so deposited.

#### Observations

35     In relation to the original charges, the Prosecution explained that the Company was charged as it was the owner of No. 31. However, there is no presumption provision under the Act presuming knowledge on the part of the owner for offences reflected in the original charges and the proposed amended charges.

36     IO Jamaludin sought to explain that the Company was charged as they were unable to obtain the particulars of the offender in order to “generate the offender (_sic_) details” in the Notices. This was so even though they knew from the domestic helper at No. 31 that the potted plants belonged to her employer who was residing there. It was not disputed that Mr Toh was residing at No. 31 during the relevant period. It was also clear that the ACRA search report reflected the particulars of Mr Toh, who was one of the directors of the Company, and Mr Toh was named as one of the offenders in the Notices dated 8 June 2018 (P3), 1 August 2018 (P5), 12 September 2018 (P7), and 24 October 2018 (P9).

37     In the present case, there was insufficient evidence to establish a _prima facie_ case against the Company even though it was the owner of No. 31. The Company did not operate a business at No. 31 and the evidence suggested that the offender was a person residing in No. 31. There was no evidence linking the acts of this person to the Company, nor evidence showing that the Company had knowledge that this person had illegally deposited the potted plants in the Area.

## Conclusion

38     In the circumstances, I was of the view that the Prosecution had not established a _prima facie_ case against the Company in relation to either the original charges or the proposed amended charges, and the Company was accordingly acquitted.
