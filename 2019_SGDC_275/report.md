Negligence (Others - with Injury)

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 33/2019.\]

12 December 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

The Plaintiff stepped in a puddle of water and fell.

2       The Plaintiff, Robert Alexander White (“White”), was a member of the Defendant country club. White commenced this action against the Defendant, Raffles Country Club (“RCC”) for damages for and arising out of personal injuries suffered as a result of the said fall. The fall had occurred at the premises of RCC on 27 July 2014 (the “fall”).

3       White claimed that RCC were negligent, and that this had led to the fall. RCC denied that they were negligent, and averred that the fall was “solely caused by or substantially contributed to by the negligence of (White)”. The Defence averred that the fall was as “a result of (White’s) own carelessness and/or negligence in failing to wear proper footwear and/or keep a proper manner (sic) (RCC’s) carpark”.

4       The trial before me was on the issue of liability only. It was not substantially contended that the fall had not occurred. It was also not substantially contended that RCC did not owe White a duty of care.

5       The main issues to be tried were summarised in the Defendant’s (Closing) Written Submissions as being:

> •    Whether RCC had failed to take all reasonable steps to keep the floor on the 4th storey of the carpark free of slippery water puddles caused by rain; and

> •    Whether and, if so, to what extent the accident was caused and/or contributed to by White’s own negligence.

6       At the conclusion of the Defendant’s (Closing) Written Submissions, it was argued that “(e)ven if the Court finds (RCC) … to be negligent (which is denied), (RCC) humbly submits that (White) should be largely liable for the accident … (RCC) submits that (White) be (found) 75% liable for the accident”.

7       After hearing all the evidence and considering the closing submissions from both parties, I found that RCC had indeed been negligent, and that such negligence had resulted in White suffering the fall. I also found that White had been, to an extent, “contributorily negligent”, and found that the damages to be awarded to him (to be assessed by the Registrar) should be reduced by a factor of 15%. I therefore entered Interlocutory Judgment for White against RCC, for 85% of damages to be assessed. Costs and Interest were to be reserved to the Registrar hearing the Assessment of Damages. RCC appealed the decision.

8       As far as evidence went, only White gave direct evidence of the circumstances surrounding the fall. The two witnesses called by RCC were employees who were both employed by RCC after the fall had occurred (on different dates from each other). These two witnesses could not give direct evidence of the circumstances surrounding the fall nor could they give direct evidence of the state of maintenance of the carpark where White had suffered the fall.

9       On the fateful date, 27 July 2014, White had driven to the premises of RCC, intending to play a round of golf. It had been raining prior to his arrival at the club. White’s evidence was that when he was driving in, it was no longer raining.

10     White had parked his car at the upper deck of the carpark. This area was not sheltered and was exposed to the elements. White had come out from his parked car and was walking towards the lift. He was wearing his golf shoes. White’s evidence was that these shoes were “fairly new” and had “good traction”.

11     White was aware that there were puddles of water on the carpark ground. White’s evidence was that he was “unaware that the floor (of the carpark) was slimy and slippery”.

12     White had no recollection as to the actual mechanics of the fall. Video footage entered in evidence showed that White had walked into a puddle of water, slipped and this caused him to fall backwards. White suffered personal injuries as a result.

13     White’s evidence was that the puddle was slimy and slippery. He was able to ascertain this as he had tried to push himself up after the fall. White stated that his hand “kept slipping on the floor”. Whilst White had opined that the slimy and slippery nature of the puddle was due to algae growth, I found that there was no scientific evidence to conclude and find what the full nature of the liquid in the puddle was. However, it was sufficient, based on White’s evidence, to conclude that the puddle had not simply been a puddle of water. For the purposes of deciding whether or not RCC had been negligent, I therefore found that the puddle had contained liquid that rendered the surface “slimy and slippery”. And it was this very nature of being slimy and slippery which led to the fall. The liquid could not have simply been rainwater.

14     The evidence was also clear that RCC had failed to put up signs warning users of the carpark or anyone who had lawful reason to be there of the possible slimy and slippery nature of the surface.

15     Whilst it would have been clear to a person walking at that particular area (as White had himself admitted) that there were puddles of water, it would not have been apparent that the wet surface had been rendered slimy and slippery. I came to this finding, as there had been no cogent challenge to White’s evidence that he was not aware of the slimy and slippery nature of the ground. As stated earlier, he would only have been aware that the surface was wet with rainwater.

16     There was evidence that another person almost suffered a similar mishap as White’s, on the very same date as the fall suffered by White. Dr Yeoh Sin Hock gave evidence at trial. Dr Yeoh is a friend of White’s and had accompanied a guest to the club on the same date for a round of golf. At the 4th storey of the carpark, as Dr Yeoh and the guest were walking towards the lift, the guest slipped. Dr Yeoh managed to grab hold of the guest to prevent the guest falling backwards. Dr Yeoh said that the surface was “slimy and slippery with greenish looking substance which I think was algae”. Again, I did not find that Dr Yeoh was in a position to definitively state that there had indeed been algae present. However, I accepted that the surface had been rendered slimy and slippery.

17     On the evidence, I found that White had not been negligent by his act of wearing his golf shoes at the material time. As there was no cogent evidence to the contrary, I accepted White’s evidence on this point that his shoes had provided “good traction”. There was no evidence that the wearing of these golf shoes had caused or contributed in any way to the fall. It was my finding that White had not been acting unreasonably when he traversed the carpark wearing these golf shoes. From White’s testimony and the viewing of the video footage, it was also my finding that White’s manner of walking just prior to the fall did not contribute in any way to the fall. White had been walking and not running.

18     The evidence tendered by RCC was lacking in its purported demonstration of RCC having taken reasonable steps to prevent mishaps as that suffered by White. As alluded to above, the evidence of the two witnesses for the Defendants was of very limited value for RCC, as the two had only been employed by RCC after the events surrounding the fall. Direct evidence had not been led as to the extent of the performance of the cleaning contractors appointed by the club. RCC did not call any representative from the cleaning contractors to give evidence as to the performance of the cleaning services at the material time. RCC also did not call any members of its staff who were employed at the time of the fall, to give evidence of RCC’s efforts in keeping the area properly maintained and safe.

19     Indeed, the evidence indicated that there had been an earlier incident, in March 2013, involving another member of the club. This earlier incident was said to be “similar to (White’s) claim”. RCC would then be aware of the potential dangers at the said area.

20     RCC had tendered extracts of minutes of meetings of the club’s Estate and Facilities Sub-Committee. These were mere extracts, and the authors were not called to give evidence as to the full meaning and purport of the matters stated therein.

21     Suffice to say, what was before the Court suggested that the club was aware of the potential safety issues of the exposed carpark areas. Coupled with the actual occurrence of the earlier incident in March 2013, it should have been an urgent task to have rendered the exposed carpark surface as safe as possible. The evidence suggested that RCC only took concrete steps after the date of White’s fall.

22     As there was insufficient evidence to show that RCC or its appointed cleaning contractor had been properly carrying out cleaning and maintenance work at the material area, I came to the conclusion that RCC had been found wanting in this regard on a balance of probabilities. After rainfall, it would only reasonably be expected that the carpark surface be wet. It would not be reasonable to expect the surface to be “slimy and slippery”. RCC would, by the time in or around the date of the fall, have been aware of the consequences of not properly maintaining the carpark surface.

23     On a balance of probabilities, I found that the evidence had shown that RCC had been negligent in not ensuring that the carpark surface was free of substances that would render the same “slimy and slippery”.

24     Therefore, the finding for the issue in the first bullet point in paragraph 5 above must be answered in White’s favour and against RCC. The evidence of the 2 employees of RCC largely consisted of their duties and the carrying out thereof, during their employ with RCC. As far as their evidence about actions taken at the club at and around the time of the fall was concerned, it would all be hearsay and of very little probative value, if at all. Using the language setting out the first issue, the conclusion must be that, on a balance of probabilities, RCC “had failed to take all reasonable steps to keep the floor on the 4th storey of the carpark free of slippery water puddles caused by rain”.

25     RCC was therefore negligent in the cleaning and proper upkeep of the area where White had suffered his fall. The surface of the carpark on which White had traversed had been rendered dangerous as a result, due to the presence of “slimy and slippery” portions. This negligence led directly to White suffering the fall. The next issue to be considered was whether White had been “contributorily negligent”.

26     The evidence showed that White was aware of the puddles. By inference, he had expected these puddles to be puddles of rainwater. He had not been warned by RCC that the puddles may have been rendered dangerous by the presence of materials which made the puddles “slimy and slippery”. RCC had not cautioned users to be vigilant.

27     RCC in its submissions, relied on the High Court case of **Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 2668 v Rott George Hugo <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 787</span> (“Rott George Hugo”).**

28     In **Rott George Hugo**, the Respondent was a subsidiary proprietor and resident of the condominium for which the Appellant was the MCST. The Respondent had been walking in the basement carpark of the condominium with his wife. He slipped and fell “after he stepped on what seemed like a normal puddle of water on the ground”. The puddle was “in fact some water thrown over a patch of oil”. It was not disputed that the Respondent “saw the slippery patch and consciously stepped into it”. The Respondent’s wife had “circumvented the slippery patch by walking around it”. The Respondent suffered personal injuries as a result of his slipping and falling.

29     The High Court found that the “maintenance system put in place by the MCST was inadequate to deal with oil spills and water puddles in the car park”.

30     Similarly, in our present case, RCC had been found wanting in their responsibilities to keep the carpark safe for its users. The evidence indicated that RCC had been aware of the potential dangers posed and yet had not timeously taken proper steps to nullify such potential dangers. There was also no cogent evidence in favour of RCC to show that the carpark had been properly maintained at the material time.

31     In **Rott George Hugo**, the High Court considered the relative “blameworthiness” of the parties in apportioning liability. The High Court found that the Respondent should bear 75% liability for the accident and therefore the MSCT’s liability was set at 25%.

32     In **Rott George Hugo**, the High Court at paragraph 42(b) said that it “was common sense to appreciate the fact that puddles of water can make the floor slippery. One who knowingly steps into a puddle of water must realise the risk of slipping and falling. Further, given the prevalent practice of car washing in car parks including the car park in the Condominium, water puddles should be expected. **The Respondent was well aware of this fact, and was also aware of the presence of oil patches in the car park.**” (emphasis added).

33     In our present case, White was aware of the water puddles and had no reason to suspect that the puddles contained anything but water. In **Rott George Hugo**, the Respondent was aware of the presence of oil patches in the carpark. This would make a big difference in the relative conduct of the Respondent in **Rott George Hugo** and White in the present case. If White had known (for example by the placing of warning signs) of the possibility that the puddles would be slimy and slippery, then his “relative blameworthiness” would be of a much higher order were he to knowingly assume the risk despite being forewarned.

34     It would be clear that a puddle of only water would be quite different from a puddle of water that had been rendered slimy and slippery. The slimy and slippery puddle would be inherently more dangerous. There was no evidence to suggest that the subject slimy and slippery puddle which White stepped into or any other puddle White may have seen prior to falling, had outward signs (for example by being coloured or having an obvious sheen) suggestive of a different nature than that of merely water. On a balance of probabilities, the finding was that there was nothing present in the subject puddle itself or other puddles that could have sufficiently warned White to take extra care. What was also obvious was that RCC had not placed any warning signs.

35     Having considered all the evidence and the submissions, I found that White had to bear some responsibility for the fall, knowing that he was stepping into a puddle of what he reasonably expected was just water. However, his “relative blameworthiness” diverges to a great degree from that of the Respondent in **Rott George Hugo**, who knew of the oil patches and yet knowingly took on that risk. White could not reasonably have known of the slimy and slippery nature of the puddle he had stepped into. I therefore found that White should bear responsibility for the fall to the extent of 15%. Interlocutory Judgment was therefore entered in favour of White against RCC for 85% of damages to be assessed.
