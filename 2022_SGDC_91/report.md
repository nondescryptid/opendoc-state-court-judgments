28 April 2022

### District Judge Kok Shu-en:

## Introduction

1       The accused is a 40 year old male Singaporean who claimed trial to three charges of the offence under Section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) for voluntarily causing hurt to public servants in the discharge of their duties:

> **DAC-907666-2020**

> You… are charged that you, on the 3rd day of April 2020, at Blk 56 Edgedale Plains #XXX Singapore 828822, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officer, Yip Wai Zhong, holding the rank of Senior Staff Sergeant (SSS), a public servant, _to wit_, by biting Yip Wai Zhong on the right rib cage area, while he was discharging his duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (Rev. Ed. 2008).

> **DAC-907667-2020**

> You… are charged that you, on the 3rd day of April 2020, at Blk 56 Edgedale Plains #XXX Singapore 828822, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officer, Lim Chu Heng, holding the rank of Inspector (INSP), a public servant, _to wit_, by slamming the door against INSP Lim Chu Heng’s body, while he was discharging his duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (Rev. Ed. 2008).

> **DAC-907668-2020**

> You… are charged that you, on the 3rd day of April 2020, at Blk 56 Edgedale Plains #XXX Singapore 828822, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officer, Khoo Bao Ling, holding the rank of Staff Sergeant (SSgt), a public servant, _to wit_, by pulling her hair and slamming her to the floor, while she was discharging her duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (Rev. Ed. 2008).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted the accused on all three charges and sentenced him to a total of 20 months’ imprisonment.

3       The accused has filed an appeal against the convictions and the sentences imposed.

## Facts

### The Prosecution’s case

4       The three victims, Officers Lim Chu Heng (PW1), Yip Wai Zhong (PW2) and Khoo Bao Ling (PW3), were officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”). They were part of a team of CNB officers who were at Blk 56 Edgedale Plains, #XXX (“the unit”) on 3 April 2020 for the purposes of an investigation involving the accused.

5       After arriving at the condominium estate, a security guard (PW5) escorted five of the CNB officers, including the three victims, to the unit while a sixth officer, Officer Mohammad Adli Bin Mohamed Nawar (PW11) remained on the ground floor at a position outside the block where he could see the unit.

6       The officers who proceeded to the unit testified that they knocked on the door and identified themselves as either police officers or CNB officers and warned the occupants of the unit that they should open the door otherwise they would effect a forced entry. The security guard, PW5, was present outside the unit with the officers and testified that he saw and heard the officers knock on the door and identify themselves.

7       PW11 who was stationed on the ground floor outside the block also informed the officers outside the unit that he saw lights within the unit, which suggested that there were people in the unit. PW11 testified that he was able to hear the knocks on the door, the barking of the dog and the voices of PW1 and PW3 identifying themselves as CNB officers from where he was stationed outside the building.

8       The door of the unit was eventually opened slightly, and the officers were able to see a person inside the unit through the opening of the door. The officers testified that they again identified themselves as CNB officers and indicated that they were looking for the accused. A few of the officers said that they also held their warrant cards identifying themselves as CNB officers up so that the person at the door could see them.

9       The person at the door, who was later established to be the accused, moved to close the door. PW1 positioned himself between the door and the door frame to prevent the door from closing, and whilst he was in this position the accused slammed the door against PW1’s body. These actions were the subject matter of the second charge (DAC 907667-2020).

10     The CNB officers eventually managed to enter the unit, and PW1 and PW2 moved to restrain the accused. PW1 placed a handcuff on the accused’s left hand while PW2 grabbed the accused around the neck to push the accused’s body downward in order to facilitate the cuffing of the accused’s right hand. While the accused was in this lowered position, he bit PW2 on his right rib cage area, which caused PW2 to fall to the ground in pain. This action was the subject matter of the first charge (DAC 907666-2020).

11     While PW1 and PW2 were restraining the accused, PW3 and two other officers, Officers Muhammad Irfan Bin Asli (PW10) and Crystal Tan Si Jie (PW12) moved to restrain the other occupant of the unit, one Anthonius (DW2). They were able to cuff one of his hands, and as they attempted to cuff the other hand DW2 resisted and moved towards the accused by wriggling on the ground.

12     As PW3 moved with DW2 towards the accused, the accused grabbed PW3 by her hair. When PW2 saw that the accused had grabbed PW3 by the hair, he used his nightstick to hit the accused on the right hand and leg. The accused released and slammed PW3 to the ground, causing PW3 to fall forward and land on her knees and hands. This action was the subject matter of the third charge (DAC 907668-2020).

13     The officers were eventually able to restrain both the accused and DW2, and a search of the unit was conducted, during which the officers seized some poppers and an unknown capsule that was subsequently found to be stained with a controlled drug. The accused was eventually administered with a warning by the CNB for the possession of the said item.

14     The Prosecution’s case is that the officers identified themselves as law enforcement officers and that it was clear to the accused that they were law enforcement officers. Thus, when the accused proceeded to cause hurt to the three victims, what he did amounted causing hurt to public servants in the discharge of their duties.

### Close of the Prosecution’s case

15     The Defence did not make any submission of no case to answer at the close of the Prosecution’s case. Having the heard the evidence led by the Prosecution, I was satisfied that a _prima facie_ case had been made out on each of the three charges and accordingly I called upon the accused to enter his defence.

### The Defence’s case

16     The accused elected to give evidence in his own defence and called upon an additional witness, DW2, who was his house mate and in the unit with the accused at the time of the incident.

17     The accused testified that he and DW2 had gone to bed around 10pm on the night of 2 April 2020 and were awoken by the sound of the pet dog barking. He heard knocking on the front door and people shouting, “_open the door_”.

18     The accused said that he looked through the viewing hole of the door and saw a group of 4 to 5 people standing outside. He described them as dressed in t-shirts and jeans. The knocking was described as very loud, and the accused said that it put him in a state of panic and shock.

19     The accused then placed a call to the security office of the condominium to seek assistance, asking them who the people outside the unit were and why they were knocking on the door. The security office did not provide a response to the specific questions raised but indicated that they would get back to him.

20     Before the security office could get back to the accused, he proceeded to open the door as the knocking sounds were so loud and he was worried that the neighbours would be disturbed by the noise. The accused testified that he thought that the persons outside the unit were either pranksters or burglars and were unaware that they were in fact law enforcement officers. He opened the front door slightly and he said that a male and female immediately barged in without identifying themselves to the accused. The accused panicked and thinking that the people coming in could be pranksters or burglars, he pushed back against the door to prevent them from entering the unit. While doing this, the door slammed on the body of one of the people seeking to enter the unit.

21     After the group of persons entered the unit, the accused got into a fight with them and amid that he bit another person over the ribcage. He then saw DW2 struggling and being choked by a lady, and so he grabbed the lady by her hair to pull her away from DW2. The accused said that it was at this point that he suddenly realised that these were law enforcement officers and told DW2 to calm down.

22     DW2’s evidence was broadly consistent with the accused’s testimony. He testified after he had been woken by the sound of the dog barking, he heard knocking on the door and later people saying, “_open the door_”, but said that he did not hear anything else, and that the people outside the unit did not identify themselves. Even as the people outside were trying to push the door open, he said that he only heard the words “_open the door_”; after they had entered the unit and were trying to restrain DW2, he said that he only heard the words “_give me your hand_”. He maintained that he did not hear any identification of the officers while they were outside the unit and after they had entered, and that he only realised that these were CNB officers after he had been placed in handcuffs by them.

23     The Prosecution applied to impeach DW2’s credibility, highlighting portions in statements that he had provided during investigations. The first statement (P11), which was recorded at 4.15 am on 3 April 2020, just a few hours after the incident, contained the following portion:

> “When it was mentioned that they were officers on duty, I asked to see their badges but did not see any. I was afraid that the big group could have been burglars.

> Several minutes later, the group of people managed to gain access and pinned me on the ground.”

24     The second statement (P12), which was recorded slightly more than a year after the incident on 24 June 2021, contained the following sentence:

> “However, I remembered saying “who are you” and “show me your warrant”.”

25     The Prosecution suggested that these portions of DW2’s statements indicate that the officers had identified them as law enforcement officers, which then prompted DW2 to ask for their “badges” or “warrant”, which was at odds with DW2’s evidence that there had been no identification at all. When asked about these, DW2 maintained his earlier testimony in court that the officers had not identified themselves and that he did not see any inconsistencies between his testimony in court and the earlier statements. He explained that he had been scared at the time and it was out of instinct that he asked the officers to show their badges even though they had never identified themselves as law enforcement officers.

## Analysis of the evidence

26     The following are the elements of an offence under Section 332

> (a)     Voluntary causing of hurt to a public servant in the discharge of his/her duty as a public servant

> (b)     Intention to prevent or deter the public servant from discharging his/her duty as a public servant

### Voluntarily causing hurt

27     Section 319 of the Penal Code defines “hurt” as “_bodily pain, disease or infirmity_”, while Section 39 of the Penal Code defines “voluntarily” as “_when he causes it by means whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it_”.

28     Evidence was led by the Prosecution as to the injuries suffered by each of the victims, which the Defence did not challenge:

> (a)     PW1 sustained a 10 cm ovoid bruise over the lateral chest wall on the left and a 2 cm ovoid bruise over his right shoulder.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> (b)     PW2’s medical examination revealed a human bite injury, for which he was treated with a vaccine to prevent tetanus. He was also given a referral to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases as he found out after he had been bitten that the accused was HIV-positive.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

> (c)     PW3’s most significant injury was a left knee contusion. She was issued with a memo to have her placed on light duty for 4 months and physiotherapy.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

29     It was also not seriously disputed that the accused did voluntarily cause hurt, in the form of the injuries above, to each of the three victims in the manner stated in each charge.

> (a)     In relation to PW1, the accused claimed that he did not specifically recall any slamming of PW1’s body with the door though he was able to recall that there was a point where he had been pushing against the door to close it while the people on the outside were pushing against it to open it. PW1’s evidence on this point was not challenged during cross-examination. The accused also conceded under cross-examination that he must have caused PW1’s injuries even if did not specifically recall the slamming.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (b)     In relation to PW2, the accused stated during examination-in-chief that “_I bite one of the guy at his rib, uh, here_”.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) This was consistent with the evidence of PW2 and the security guard, PW5, who testified to seeing the accused bite one of the officers at the side of his body, which the Defence did not challenge.

> (c)     In relation to PW3, there was suggestion by the Defence during the cross-examination of PW1 that the accused’s act of pulling down PW3’s hair was a natural reaction to the pain of being hit by PW2 with the nightstick. PW1 disagreed with this, saying “_I could see very clearly that the action that was swinging Bao Ling was purposeful, uh, to the ground_.”[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) The accused later stated during examination-in-chief that “_I remember I pulled a lady hair away from Anthonius_”[^7] and accepted during cross-examination that he had grabbed PW3’s hair and slammed her to the ground.[^8]

30     On the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the accused had voluntarily caused hurt to the three victims.

### Intention to prevent or deter public servant from discharging duty

31     It was not in contention before me that the victims in this case were public servants within the definition of Section 21(1)(g) of the Penal Code. It was also undisputed that at the time of the incident, the victims were discharging their duties as public servants as they were at the unit for the purposes of an investigation involving the accused.

32     At the heart of the defence was the contention that the CNB officers had not identified themselves as law enforcement officers, or even if they had done so, the accused could not perceive this. It flowed from this position then that the accused did not know that the victims were public servants when he caused hurt to them, and accordingly could not have intended to prevent or deter them from discharging their duties as public servants.

33     In _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”), the High Court noted that while knowledge that the victim is a public servant going about his duties is not stated explicitly in Section 332, it is an implicit requirement, though “_the knowledge required is objective and not subjective knowledge… if an ordinary person would have such knowledge in the circumstances of the case, it is not open to the accused person to claim that he did not know_”.

34     With this mind, these were the two issues that I focused on in my evaluation of the evidence:

> (a)     Whether the CNB officers did in fact identify themselves as law enforcement officers; and, if they did,

> (b)     Would an ordinary person in the circumstances have such knowledge that they were law enforcement officers.

(A)   Did the officers identify themselves as law enforcement OFFICERS?

35     A total of seven witnesses – six CNB officers and the condominium security guard – testified that the officers had identified themselves as law enforcement officers. The accused and DW2, testified that they heard no such identification.

36     Among the Prosecution witnesses who were at the scene, I note that not all of them had identical recollections of the event. For example, PW10 testified that he was one of the officers who had knocked on the door of the unit, even though none of the other officers with him recalled that he had done so. Similarly, the security guard PW5 testified that he had identified himself to the occupant of the unit and confirmed to them that the officers were indeed law enforcement officers, though this did not feature in the testimony of any of the other witnesses. There was also some uncertainty as to whether the officers had identified themselves as being CNB or police officers, with the witnesses giving varying testimonies on this point.

37     The Defence also highlighted that some of the officers recalled that the accused had been brought to the hospital after the event, but the accused testified that this was not done. The defence argues that this suggests that the officers’ recollection of the events of the day, including whether they had identified themselves, is flawed.

38     When examined against the totality of the evidence, I was of the view that these discrepancies and inconsistencies were minor and falling well within the allowance to be given to human fallibility in observation, retention, and recollection. Given the dynamic nature of the events of that day, it would be unrealistic to expect that all the witnesses would have been able to fully observe and recall every aspect of what was happening with the same perspective and level of detail.

39     Apart from these minor inconsistencies, I was of the view that there was a significant degree of consistency in the recalling of the event by the officers and the security guard: from the arrival of the officers at the condominium estate, the escorting of the officers to the unit, the knocking on the door, the identification of the officers, the interactions after the door opened and the altercations that followed.

40     I note in particular that the security guard, PW5, was a neutral party, having never met nor had any association with any of the persons involved prior to the incident and having no reason to embellish or hide anything that he witnessed at the scene. His testimony substantially corroborated that of the officers, confirming that the officer had identified themselves to the occupants of the unit prior to the entry. In his words “_they were begging for a long period of time and they were identifying themselves_”.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

41     Accordingly, I was satisfied on the evidence that the officers had identified themselves as law enforcement officers prior to the altercation with the accused.

(B)   Would an ordinary person in those circumstances have such knowledge that they were law enforcement officers?

42     The alternative plank of the defence’s case rests on the position that even if the officers had identified themselves, the accused simply could not and did not hear this.

43     There was no real dispute that while the officers were outside the unit, there were knocks on the door and that the dog had been barking, and that these sounds were loud. This was readily accepted by several of the Prosecution’s witnesses. While the witnesses who were at the door of the unit all maintained that there had been identification of the officers before entry into the unit, given where they were physically situated – outside the unit – they would not have been able to confirm whether this identification was audible to occupants within the unit. As PW2 very reasonably put it when asked whether certain sounds could be heard inside the unit, “_I’m not there to judge because I’m not in the house_”.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

44     PW11, the officer who was assigned to remain at the ground floor, was the only witness apart from the accused and DW2 who was not standing at the door of the unit during this period before the officers entered the unit. PW11 gave a straightforward account of standing on the ground floor, outside the building, where he first heard loud knocking on a door, after which he observed the lights in the unit come on. After he informed the rest of his team via the team group chat about the lights, he said that he heard louder knocks and that he heard his colleagues identifying themselves as CNB officers. He testified that he was able to hear the voices of PW1 and PW3 identifying themselves as CNB and explained that he was able to recognise their voices because he had worked with them for two years.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) When cross-examined, PW11 confirmed that he did hear a dog barking loudly as the officers were knocking the door and maintained that he was able to hear PW1 and PW3 identify themselves as CNB officers.

45     In my view, PW11’s testimony demonstrated that even with the loud sounds of knocking and barking, the sound of the officers’ identifying themselves as CNB officers was audible to a person who was on the ground floor, five storeys down from the unit. If the sound of the officers identifying themselves as CNB officers could be heard by a person at the distance that PW11 was at, I could not see how the same would not have been audible to the occupants of the unit.

46     Moreover, it was not the Defence’s position that the accused could not hear the officers say _anything_ at all while they were outside the unit – both the accused and DW2 testified that they could hear the words “_open the door_”. If they were able to hear those words, I find it difficult to see how they would not have been able to hear the officers identifying themselves.

47     The accused testified that he contacted the condominium’s security guard for assistance regarding the people who were outside his unit. The Defence argued that he would not have made this call had he known that they were law enforcement officers. I accepted that it is possible that it may not have been entirely clear to the accused who was outside his unit at the point when he placed the call, which is what prompted him to call for help. However, it is clear to me that the accused must have known that the persons who were outside were in fact law enforcement officers, at the very latest by the time he opened the door.

48     According to the accused, there was a gap of about 10 to 15 minutes between the time that the accused placed the call to the security guards and the time that he opened the door. The officers testified that they had issued warnings and identified themselves to the occupants “_a few times_”[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) before the door was opened, and in the words of the security guard “_they were begging for a long period of time and they were identifying themselves, but no one wanted to respond until much later_”.[^13] The repeated identifications in this period would have enabled the accused to perceive and comprehend that the persons outside were identifying themselves as law enforcement officers.

49     If the accused truly had no idea who the people outside his unit were, or worse still, thought that they were burglars or troublemakers, the rational and logical course of action to take would have been to keep the door closed and wait for either the security guards or the police to arrive. The fact that he proceeded to open the door without waiting for the security guards to respond to his request for assistance suggests that he had become aware that the people outside the unit were not burglars or troublemakers but instead law enforcement officers.

50     Even if I was to accept that the accused had still not been able to hear the verbal identifications of the officers before the door opened, which I did not, their identities would have become clear to the accused by the time he opened the door of the unit for the first time. Evidence was given of the following steps taken to identify the officers to the occupants of the unit just after the door was opened:

> (a)     PW1 testified that when the door opened, he called out the accused’s name and the accused acknowledged. He then told the accused that he was from CNB and that “_we are looking for you and we need to speak to you inside the unit_”. PW1 said that he showed his pass identifying him as a CNB officer to the accused at this point, just after the door had been opened.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> (b)     PW2 and PW12 also said that they showed their identification cards and identified themselves as CNB officers to the subject inside the unit[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15), while PW3 and PW10 gave evidence that they saw other officers holding up their identification cards.[^16]

> (c)     The security guard, PW5, also testified that after the door was first opened, he was called to the door where he provided confirmation to the persons in the unit that these were indeed the authorities, which he said he did.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> (d)     PW1 testified that whilst he was being between the door and the door frame, which is the subject matter of the second charge, he kept repeating that “_we are from CNB and you don’t have to do this. You calm down_”.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

51     The evidence of the security guard, PW5, about the exchange between the officers and the accused at the door was particularly telling, as he clearly found it puzzling that the accused would say that he did not know who the officers were given the extent and effort that had gone into identifying the officers. His suggestion seems to be that the accused was being deliberately obtuse[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19):

> Q:    Okay. It is also my instructions that the ac---the---the---the group of officers, group of people, they barged in and the house occupant was afraid and, in that situation, the house occupant tried to close the door.

> A    He was resisting, yes. Uh, and **he was acting like he didn’t know who they were** and he kept on asking, “Who are you? Uh, what---what---” I mean, like---something, like, “What are you doing here?” and “Who are you people?” and all that. So, the thing is, uh---that’s when they asked me to come forward and---and, uh, you know, to identify that these, uh, people are legit.

> Q    Okay. If I were to say that, the CNB officers present did not identify themselves as CNB officers properly to the house occupant, would you agree or disagree?

> A    I disagree. Because, uh, they were calling out for a long period of time and I doubt---I doubt so it wasn’t heard.

> \[Emphasis added\]

52     These interactions that took place just after the door was opened, which went beyond just verbal identification but included the showing of the identification passes, would have made it amply clear to the accused that the persons standing outside his unit were in fact law enforcement officers who were at his unit to carry out their duties. I note it was not the Defence’s position that the accused thought that the officers had falsely identified themselves as law enforcement officers, but even if there had been any lingering doubts before the door had been opened, what took place immediately after the door opened would have put those doubts to rest.

53     The Prosecution applied to impeach the credit of DW2, whose testimony in court was largely along similar lines to that of the accused, _i.e._ that no identification of the officers was perceived. However, in his earlier statements to the police, DW2 had indicated that it had been “_mentioned they were officers on duty_” and that he had asked them to “_show me your warrant_”. The Prosecution argued that these portions of the earlier statements suggest that it was in fact apparent to DW2 by that point in time that these people had asserted their identities as law enforcement officers.

54     I note that in the earlier of the two statements, P11, which was recorded from DW2 on 3 April 2020, just shortly after the incident took place, DW2 did say that he was “_afraid that the big group could have been burglars_” though he also states that “_it was mentioned that they were officers on duty_”, which points to the officers having identified themselves as such. This stood in contradiction with DW2’s position in court that he had heard no identification at all.

55     There were also aspects of the accused’s testimony that betrayed his position. By the accused’s own account, he said that he did not hear any of the officers identify themselves as being from the police of CNB as he was focused on keeping the officers out of his house, but he realised that they were enforcement officers at the point when he was handcuffed and pinned to the ground, even though he had heard no one utter the words “_police_” or “_CNB_” to him. Yet as the Prosecution pointed out, it is curious that when he was asked by the officers whether he had anything to declare, he somehow instinctively knew that the officers would be interested in certain drug-related items in his house, even though he claims that he did not hear them identify themselves as being from the CNB. This again suggested that the accused must have known that the officers were from CNB prior to that point.

56     Having considered the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the CNB officers had identified themselves as law enforcement officers and that this was done in a manner that would have allowed an ordinary person to perceive this identification and to have knowledge that these were in fact law enforcement officers. Accordingly, it is not open to the accused to claim that he did not possess the same knowledge. On the evidence, I find that he did in fact know that the victims were law enforcement officers before he inflicted the injuries on them.

57     Given that the accused knew that the victims were law enforcement officers, it could clearly be inferred from the accused’s conduct against the victims that his intention was to prevent or deter them from discharging their duties as public servants. Indeed, his entire course of conduct during the incident was characterised by various witnesses as being resistant towards the officers. I was therefore satisfied that the accused had acted with intention to prevent or deter the victims from discharging their duties as public servants.

### Right of private defence

58     In its closing submission, the Defence’s position was that the accused had inflicted hurt on PW1, PW2 and PW3 in self-defence, because he believed that the officers were pranksters. I did not accept that the right to private defence had arisen in this case.

59     Section 101 of the Penal Code provides that the right of private defence arises where “_the defender reasonably believes that there is danger to the body (either his own or that of any other person) arising form any act which is an offence against the human body or an attempt or a threat to commit the offence_”.

60     During the accused’s testimony, he asserted that what he had done was in the interest of safeguarding his life and his property, which he said had been “_at stake_”[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20). However, at no point in the trial was there any evidence that any of the officers did anything that may have satisfied Section 101 of the Penal Code. From the rest of his evidence and that of DW2, it appears that all the officers had done prior to the altercation was to knock on the door loudly and say, “_open the door_”, and there is no dispute it was the accused who first moved to take any violent action when he slammed the door against PW1’s body.

61     Even if PW1, PW2 or PW3 had acted in such a way that would have given rise to the right of private defence (though on the evidence I was satisfied that they had not), Section 106A of the Penal Code clearly negated any right of private defence given that PW1, PW2 and PW3 had at all times been public servants acting in good faith under the actual authority of their office, and as I have explained above, the accused clearly knew, or at the very least had reason to believe, that they were public servants.

## Decision on the charges

62     Having considered the evidence before me and for the reasons I have set out above, I was satisfied that the Prosecution proved the elements of the three charges beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the accused on all three charges.

## Sentencing

63     Under Section 332 of the Penal Code, the punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant form his duty is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or any combination of such punishments.

64     In their addresses on sentence, both parties referred to the sentencing framework for offences under Section 332 of the Penal Code as set down by the High Court in _Jeffrey Yeo_, which comprises of three broad sentencing bands, within which the severity of an offence and hence the sentence to be imposed may be determined based on the twin considerations of harm and culpability:

65     To assist in the assessment of harm and culpability, the High Court set out a non-exhaustive list of factors relating to the harm and the culpability of the offence:

> (a)     the degree of hurt caused and its consequences;

> (b)     the use or attempted use of a weapon or other dangerous implement or means (eg, biting) and its capacity to do harm;

> (c)     the age, lack of maturity or presence of mental disorder where it affects materially the responsibility of the offender;

> (d)     the circumstances leading to the commission of the offence (eg, the offender’s motivations for causing hurt to the victim, whether the offence was planned or premeditated, whether it demonstrated contempt for police officers and their authority);

> (e)     the timing and location of the offence, in particular whether it was committed within the public’s view and hearing;

> (f)     whether the offence involved a sustained or repeated attack;

> (g)     the number of offenders involved;

> (h)     whether the offender intended to inflict more serious hurt than what materialised;

> (i)     whether any steps were taken to avoid detection or prosecution; and

> (j)     the offender’s criminal history and propensity.

66     The Court also indicated that the sentencing bands are premised on offenders pleading guilty and not having related criminal antecedents, and so appropriate adjustment may have to be made where the offender claims trial or when the offender has a bad criminal record.

### Antecedents

67     The accused was untraced for antecedents.

### Submissions on sentence and mitigation

68     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment, comprising of the following sentences on the individual charges, which they argued should all run consecutively:

69     On the individual sentences, the Prosecution argued that the charge involving the biting of PW2 on the right rib cage fell within Category 2 of the sentencing framework, while the remaining two charges fell within Category 1.

70     The Defence sought a global sentence of 9 to 12 months, on the basis that the accused’s entire course of conduct against the three victims fell within Category 1, for which the appropriate individual sentences should be in the range of 2 to 9 months’ imprisonment.

71     In mitigation, the Defence highlighted the fact that this was the accused’s first brush with the law and that he was not a hardened criminal. Testimonials from relatives and friends attested to his character, and a counselling report indicated that the accused possesses a large degree of self-awareness and is keen to learn from his tribulations.

### Reasons for the sentences imposed

#### DAC-907666-220

72     Of the three charges against the accused, the charge involving the bite over PW2’s rib cage was arguably the most serious, which the accused did whilst knowing that he was HIV-positive.

73     In urging the court to regard this as a Band 2 situation, the Prosecution highlighted two foreign cases that the High Court had cited in _Jeffrey Yeo_ as illustrations of cases falling within Category 2 of the sentencing framework, both of which involved offenders who were also HIV-positive.

74     I agreed with the Prosecution that the fact that the accused bit PW2 while knowing that he was HIV-positive was clearly an aggravating factor in this case and disagreed with the Defence that this was a neutral point. The act of biting is a dangerous means of causing harm, and the accused’s HIV-positive status meant that his act of biting carried a capacity to cause a very significant degree of harm given the risk of infection.

75     For an offence to fall within Category 2, the High Court in _Jeffrey Yeo_ noted that there would generally be three or more aggravating factors present. Indeed, a perusal of the case illustrations cited in the judgment do feature a significant number of aggravating factors. In particular, the two foreign cases that the Prosecution placed reliance on featured several other aggravating factors in addition to the fact of the HIV-positive status of the offender:

> (a)     In _R v Ramazan Gungor_ \[2015\] EWCA Crim 877, the offender bit a prison guard who was trying to calm him down in his cell. The bite was so deep that the guard bled, even though he was wearing a fleece. The guard was tested for Hepatitis B, C and HIV and received various vaccination. The tests came back negative after two to three weeks, and in the meantime the guard suffered some psychological harm. The bite left a scar behind. The offender was traced with violence-related antecedents.

> (b)     In _R v Dalius Ziemelis_ \[2015\] EWCA Crim 1220, the offender deliberately spat at a police officer as he was being arrested and his spittle into the officer’s mouth and eyes. Apart from the unpleasant side effects of the medication that she had to take to reduce the risk of contracting HIV, the officer also suffered a prolonged period of severe psychological and emotional consequences for a period of 6 months before she received news that she was not infected. The sentence imposed by the court took into account the fact that the offender wanted the officer to believe that she would be at risk of infection and the psychological consequences suffered by the police officer.

76     Relying on these two cases, the Prosecution argued that the fact that the accused bit PW2 while knowing that he was HIV-positive should in itself warrant this being a Category 2 situation. However, I noted that there was nothing in the High Court’s decision in _Jeffrey Yeo_ that suggested that the mere fact that an offender bites or spits while knowing he is HIV-positive without more would place a case within Category 2. In my view, the fact that the accused knew that he was HIV-positive was but one of the aggravating factors that ought to factor into the determination of the overall severity of the offence.

77     In terms of the degree of hurt to PW2, the photograph of PW2’s injury (P3) did show a rather significant mark on his body in the immediate aftermath of the incident, and there was unchallenged evidence during the trial that he was heard screaming in pain when he was bitten by the accused. This was certainly not a trivial injury.

78     However, apart from these, there was no indication that the injury had any more serious or lasting implications. PW2 was fortunately not infected, and the medical report (P5) indicated that there was no open wounds or laceration. There was no evidence of psychological harm suffered by PW2, even though he did have to wait for three months before he could be tested. There was also nothing in the evidence on which I could infer that the accused intended to infect PW2 or cause him to believe that he was at risk of infection.

79     While the present case bore similarities with the two foreign cases in terms of the HIV-positive status of the offender, I was of the view that the present case was less serious than the foreign cases. In terms of the overall level of aggravating factors present, I did not think that this case was sufficiently aggravated to be placed in Category 2 and was more appropriately placed at the higher end of Category 1.

80     The indicative sentencing band for Category 1 cases starts from fines and goes up to one year imprisonment. In my view, the appropriate starting point within this band for the charge involving PW2 was at the higher end of the band at around 10 to 12 months’ imprisonment. From this starting point, I calibrated the sentence upward to account for the fact that the accused had claimed trial and arrived at a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment.

#### DAC-907667-220

81     For the charge involving the slamming of the door on PW1’s body, I agreed with parties that this was a situation falling at the lower end of Category 1. The injuries sustained by PW1 was fortunately minor, with only to bruises and no other more serious injuries such as fractures. He was given two days of outpatient medical leave with analgesia.

82     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment was appropriate for this charge.

#### DAC-907668-220

83     For the charge involving the pulling of PW3’s hair and slamming her to the floor, I agreed with parties again that this was also a Category 1 situation. The most significant injury that PW3 suffered was a contusion to her left knee, and as a result she was issued with a medical memo indicating that she should be placed on light duty for four months and to attend physiotherapy.

84     Given the more significant degree of harm suffered by PW3 as compared to PW1, I agreed with the Prosecution that a slightly higher sentence was warranted on this charge and imposed a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment.

### Consecutive sentences

85     I ordered the imprisonment terms imposed on all three charges to run consecutively. In doing so, I bore in mind the one-transaction rule and the totality principle as set out in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>. While all three offences were committed on the same occasion and within a short span of time, they were committed against three distinct victims and invaded distinct legally protected interests.

86     I was also of the view that the aggregate imprisonment term of 20 months was not a crushing sentence in view of the accused’s entire set of offending conduct, his record and prospects, and accordingly did not offend the totality principle.

87     In considering the mitigation plea submitted by the Defence, I did not find anything of mitigating value that would warrant an adjustment on the sentence to be imposed. While the accused was indeed a first-time offender, in my view this was more of a neutral factor. Had he been a traced offender, this may have been an aggravating factor, and so the lack of this aggravating factor was not something I regarded as being mitigating in nature.

## Conclusion

88     The accused was therefore convicted on three charges and sentenced to a total of 20 months’ imprisonment.

89     The accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
