Tort – Negligence – Causation

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 9/2020.\]

12 May 2020

### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## Introduction

1       This is the plaintiff’s appeal against my decision at the bifurcated trial for liability for personal injuries sustained in a road accident.

2       At the end of the trial, plaintiff’s counsel requested that parties be allowed to submit a written closing submission. Defendant’s counsel, however, indicated that he would like to do an oral closing submission, and that was even if the court should allow plaintiff’s counsel to do a written submission. On that understanding, defendant’s counsel made his oral submission at the close of the proceedings, whilst plaintiff’s counsel was given some time to prepare his written closing submission which would include a reply to the defendant’s closing submission.

3       Having received the parties’ closing submissions, whether oral or written, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim and held him wholly liable for his own injuries and damages. I now elaborate on the reasons I had earlier given for my decision.

## Background

### Facts[^1]

4       31 July 2016 started as an ordinary Sunday for both the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff, a self-employed swimming coach, was on his way to Livia, a condominium along Pasir Ris Grove, to conduct swimming lessons. He was riding his motorcycle, registration number FBJ1584Z. The defendant was returning home from church,[^2] and driving his motor car, registration number SJP7476L.

5       A short distance into Pasir Ris Grove from Pasir Ris Drive 8, in the vicinity of the condominium, The Palette, the plaintiff and defendant allegedly collided. It was about 9.50am.

6       ‘Allegedly’, because whilst it was the plaintiff’s case that the defendant “overtook the Plaintiff’s motor cycle on the Plaintiff’s right against the traffic flow, and collided into the Plaintiff’s motor cycle…”,[^3] it was the defendant’s case that “there was no contact whatsoever between the Plaintiff’s motor vehicle… and the Defendant’s motor vehicle…”.[^4]

7       What was undisputed was that the plaintiff lost his balance and fell off his motorcycle onto the road. As a result of the fall, there was damage to the plaintiff’s vehicle. The plaintiff also sustained bodily injuries which included “abrasions over his right foot and left little finger”.[^5]

8       Pasir Ris Grove is a two-way road, with two lanes in each direction.[^6] A motorist coming from Pasir Ris Drive 8 would turn left to be on Pasir Ris Grove. The motorist would also pass many condominiums lining Pasir Ris Grove on the left. The condominiums he would pass, and in the order stated, would include: The Palette, NV Residences which the defendant stayed in, and Livia which was where the plaintiff was headed for to coach swimming.

### The plaintiff’s case

9       It was the plaintiff’s case that as he exited the TPE at Exit 3C to get onto Pasir Ris Drive 8 to head towards Pasir Ris Grove, he had already noticed the defendant’s white motor car as it was “driving too close to \[his\] motor cycle”.[^7] When he turned left into Pasir Ris Grove from Pasir Ris Drive 8, the defendant’s motor car was still behind his motorcycle.

10     Along the two-lane Pasir Ris Grove and near The Palette, the plaintiff noticed that “a black Mercedes”[^8] travelling in front of his motorcycle had stopped. The plaintiff was then travelling on the left lane of Pasir Ris Grove. Upon seeing that the Mercedes vehicle in front of him had stopped, the plaintiff filtered to the right lane. According to the plaintiff, this was what happened next:[^9]

> … suddenly the Defendant’s motor vehicle which was traveling \[_sic_\] behind my motor cycle on the left lane without signaling \[_sic_\] overtook me on my right and in the process the Defendant’s motor vehicle had overlapped partially into the opposite direction against the traffic flow, and had squeezed into my path.

The plaintiff went on to describe that because of the defendant’s actions, the defendant’s motor car “slightly impacted” the right handle of his motorcycle, causing him to fall off his motorcycle and sustain injuries.

11     The plaintiff was “shocked and angry”[^10] with the defendant for causing him to fall. When he managed to get up from his fallen position, the plaintiff confronted the defendant who was still seated inside his motor car by knocking on the defendant’s car bonnet. A female passenger was also inside the car. The defendant then alighted from his car and, according to the plaintiff, asked the plaintiff why the plaintiff had kicked his motor car. All these happened before the plaintiff’s motorcycle was towed away for repairs or the ambulance came and conveyed the plaintiff to Changi General Hospital.

12     The plaintiff submitted that the defendant’s negligence caused him to suffer pain and injuries and put him to loss and expenses.

### The defendant’s case

13     It was the defendant’s case that when he was on Pasir Ris Grove, he was travelling on the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove going in the direction of his home at NV Residences. He was, however, “intend\[ing\] to go to a petrol kiosk about 2km away before going home.”[^11]

14     The defendant’s account of what happened differed from the plaintiff’s:

> The Plaintiff was on the left lane travelling behind a black Mercedes. As the black Mercedes turned left into the Palette, the Plaintiff overtook the black Mercedes on its right by going into the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove. The Plaintiff did not check it was clear for him to do so. When the Plaintiff swerve \[_sic_\] right, he then realised my vehicle was on his right and he lost control of his bike. He then kicked the left rear bottom of my rear \[_sic_\] to move away from my car and he fell down on the road.

The defendant then described that the plaintiff became very aggressive, pounded on the defendant’s car bonnet and screamed profanities at him as being the cause of his falling from his motorcycle.

15     The defendant maintained that he was on the right lane of the two-way road of Pasir Ris Grove “\[t\]hroughout the incident”.[^12] He denied the plaintiff’s police report which stated that he had gone against the flow of traffic to overtake the plaintiff’s motorcycle. It was also the defendant’s case that “no part of \[his\] car hit the Plaintiff’s bike at any time as alleged.”[^13] In short, the defendant denied the allegations put forth by the plaintiff and refuted the plaintiff’s version of what happened.

## Issues to be determined

16     For purposes of determining the liability issue for this case, the plaintiff and the defendant listed a total of 12 questions of fact[^14] that the court should decide. I have condensed them to the three issues listed below as I considered that in answering these three issues, I would have addressed all issues listed by both counsel or rendered them unnecessary. The issues were:

> (a)     Whether the defendant was travelling on the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove at all material time;

> (b)     Whether the defendant overtook the plaintiff by travelling against the traffic flow; and

> (c)     Whether there was contact between the parties’ vehicles.

## Issue 1: Whether the defendant was travelling on the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove at all material time

17     When I rendered my oral decision, I had addressed this issue from the angle of which lane the plaintiff was travelling on. In his affidavit affirmed on 19 June 2019, the plaintiff had deposed that he was travelling on the left lane and the defendant’s motor car was behind his motorcycle, also on the left lane.[^15] His Statement of Claim dated 11 January 2019[^16] and his traffic police report made on 1 August 2016 at 8.36am[^17] however, stated that he was travelling on the right lane and the defendant’s motor car “kept tailgating”[^18] him, hence suggesting that the defendant was also on the right lane.

18     When confronted with this discrepancy during cross-examination, the plaintiff explained[^19] that what was reported in the police report was in response to the policeman’s question of where the accident had happened. What he deposed in his affidavit was in response to his lawyer’s invitation to explain the whole scenario.

19     From the plaintiff’s explanation, I accepted that when the plaintiff entered Pasir Ris Grove from Pasir Ris Drive 8, he had travelled on the left lane. When the alleged accident happened a short while after that, he had moved to the right lane. This would be consistent with the plaintiff’s accounts in his affidavit,[^20] that he was travelling on the left lane until he noticed a black Mercedes vehicle in front of his motorcycle “had stopped and was stationary”[^21] and so he “moved to the right lane”.[^22]

20     From the plaintiff’s description of the defendant’s “driving too close to \[his\] motor cycle”[^23] or “tailgating”[^24] him from when they exited the TPE, and being “still behind \[his\] motor cycle on the left lane”[^25] when they entered Pasir Ris Grove, it was the plaintiff’s suggestion that the defendant had followed the same path or pattern of travel as the plaintiff.

21     Plaintiff’s counsel even submitted in his closing submission[^26] that given the location of NV Residences to The Palette, it would be reasonable for a motorist to remain on the left lane of Pasir Ris Grove, drive past The Palette, and then turn left into NV Residences. After all, the defendant did state in his police report that he was on his way home.[^27] Plaintiff’s counsel therefore raised doubts on the defendant’s statement in his affidavit[^28] and his answer during cross-examination[^29] when the defendant said that he was intending to go to a petrol kiosk 2km away.

22     The plaintiff’s version of the defendant’s path of travel was of course at variance with the defendant’s version.

23     From the defendant’s police report made on 31 July 2016 at 12.45pm, three hours after the incident, the defendant had reported:[^30]

> I WAS DRIVING ALONG PASIR RIS GROVE ON MY WAY HOME. A MOTORBIKE WAS DRIVING IN FRONT OF ME.

> THERE WERE TWO LANES. HE TOOK THE LEFT ONE AND I TOOK THE RIGHT LANE. … (Uppercase in original.)

The defendant’s description in his police report was consistent with the sketch plan that the defendant provided in his Singapore Accident Statement made on 2 August 2016.

24     During his cross-examination, the defendant also maintained that he was on the right lane when he entered Pasir Ris Grove.[^31] The defendant explained that at that point he had already formed the intention to drop in at the petrol kiosk although his original intention when he left church was to head for home.[^32] That was _why_ he had taken the right lane. The defendant in fact agreed with plaintiff’s counsel that if he were indeed going directly to home, he would have kept to the left lane of Pasir Ris Grove.[^33] But he was not yet going home. It was therefore the defendant’s case that he was travelling on the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove at all material time.

25     Having reviewed the evidence before me, I was inclined towards the defendant’s account of what happened. My reasons follow.

26     In his affidavit, the plaintiff had also deposed that when he moved from the left lane to the right lane to avoid the black Mercedes in front of him which had stopped, the defendant’s motor car which was behind his motorcycle on the left lane overtook him on his right.[^34] The plaintiff then described the defendant’s motor car going onto the lane of the opposing traffic and then squeezing back into the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove going in the direction of the condominium, Livia.[^35]

27     By this account, the plaintiff was effectively saying that the defendant cut dangerously across two lanes from the left lane of Pasir Ris Grove, took the risk of travelling against oncoming traffic from the opposite direction, and then carelessly filtered back onto the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove going in the direction of Livia.

28     I had found the above incredible; if the defendant did make such an extraordinary move of cutting across two lanes, surely the plaintiff would have made a point of it in one of his reports. There was no mention of this extraordinary move. Instead, in his police report, the plaintiff even stated that he himself was “travelling at the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove road”[^36] and the defendant was tailgating him, as if both were on the right lane. Also, the filtering across two lanes would have to be at a fast speed, since plaintiff’s counsel in his closing submission[^37] stated that the defendant knew that the plaintiff was filtering to the right lane at that time and so –

> … decided to quickly filter into the right lane and inched into the lane going in the opposite direction to overtake both the black Mercedes and the Plaintiff…

Such acts could not have gone unmentioned if they did take place, particularly since traffic police reports and accident statements are meant to record what happened, and parties generally would use them to protect their own position.

29     Having therefore reviewed the evidence before me, I am inclined to believe that as the plaintiff and defendant exited the TPE at Exit 3C, the defendant was behind the plaintiff’s motorcycle. This continued even on Pasir Ris Drive 8 as it was only a short distance before the parties had to turn left again onto Pasir Ris Grove. However, when the leftmost lane along Pasir Ris Drive 8 led into Pasir Ris Grove, the road split into two lanes. That was when the plaintiff took the left lane of the two lanes on Pasir Ris Grove whilst the defendant took the right lane. Shortly after, in front of The Palette, the plaintiff noticed a black Mercedes vehicle in front of his motorcycle had stopped. The plaintiff therefore filtered to the right lane. Just at that moment, the defendant’s motor car, which had been travelling on the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove since the start of Pasir Ris Grove, came forward. That was when the plaintiff fell onto the road.

30     The conclusion from the above was that the defendant was indeed driving on the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove at all material time.

31     In the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions,[^38] the plaintiff took issue with the defendant’s opening statement which suggested that the defendant had modified his case just three days before the trial to say that he was travelling in front of the plaintiff. The plaintiff therefore urged this court to find the defendant’s evidence inconsistent. The plaintiff submitted:

> … in paragraph 4 of the Defendant’s Opening Statement which was filed on 24 February 2020, three days before the Trial, his evidence changed and he stated he was driving in front of the Plaintiff.

I was unable to appreciate this argument but considered that I should address it.

32     I did not interpret paragraph 4 of the Defendant’s Opening Statement the way the plaintiff did, as I considered that the whole paragraph needed to be read in context and in its entirety. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Defendant’s Opening Statement in fact read:

> 3.    The Defendant will show that the Defendant was travelling on the right lane and the Plaintiff was travelling in the left lane just before the accident. …

> 4.    The Defendant will also show that the said Pasir Ris Grove Road \[_sic_\] becomes a 2 lane road well before the Palette Condominium and that the Defendant was not travelling behind the Plaintiff _from the start of Pasir Ris Grove Road_ \[_sic_\] _to the accident site_ (emphasis is mine).

Reading these in context merely informed that from the start of Pasir Ris Grove, the defendant’s motor car was not travelling directly behind the plaintiff’s motorcycle.

## Issue 2: Whether the defendant overtook the plaintiff by travelling against the traffic flow

33     It was the plaintiff’s pleaded case[^39] that he was riding “along the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove Road \[_sic_\]” when the following happened:

> … suddenly and abruptly, without any warning and/or signal, motor vehicle… driven by the Defendant overtook the Plaintiff’s motor cycle on the Plaintiff’s right against the traffic flow, and collided into the Plaintiff’s motor cycle…

34     In discussing Issue 1 earlier, we had addressed the point about the lane that the plaintiff was travelling on. It was my finding that the plaintiff was on the left lane of Pasir Ris Grove when he first came onto this road. However, he had later filtered from there to the right lane. There is no dispute that the alleged accident happened on the right lane of Pasir Ris Grove.

35     Although the plaintiff made it a point to impress upon this court that before he filtered to the right lane he had turned on his indicator to signal right and checked his blind spot,[^40] and although these were not recorded in either his police statement or the accident statement, the defendant had not challenged these. No issue therefore arose from these.

36     It was the plaintiff’s case that the accident was caused by the defendant’s negligence in the driving and management of his motor car. The plaintiff therefore alleged that the defendant had travelled against oncoming traffic.[^41] When questioned during cross-examination on his basis for saying that the defendant went against the traffic flow, the plaintiff’s candid first response was that because he had filtered to the right lane and was occupying it, so, “there’s no more lanes on the right. So, the only way, I believe he overtook me from opposite direction.”[^42] This was reiterated when the plaintiff said, “I confirm that he overtook me from the opposite direction _because I was already in the right lane_” (my emphasis).[^43] The plaintiff then referred to the scene photograph at page 18 of his Affidavit of his Evidence-in-Chief[^44] to support his pleaded case.

37     The photograph showed the defendant’s motor car to be straddling a continuous white line.[^45] Although rather faint, it is reasonable to presume that to be the divider line of the two traffic flows of Pasir Ris Grove. The defendant denied driving against oncoming traffic. He explained that his two right wheels were, at most, on the divider line and that he had not gone against the traffic flow.[^46] He further explained:[^47]

> ... I tried to give a lot of distance between the m---the Mercedes-Benz and the motorbike. So that is the farthest I could go on the right-hand side of the lane.

38     From the photograph, I was unable to conclude if the defendant had indeed travelled against the traffic flow. I would actually consider that if he had in fact driven against the traffic flow and then filtered back to the left – that is, filtered to ‘the right lane’ that we had been referring to – the position of the motor car would be at more of an angle than was presently shown in the photograph. Further, it appeared to me that the plaintiff was also unsure what actually happened as he had based his allegation of the defendant’s driving against the traffic flow on his own position with nothing more to corroborate.

39     What might perhaps be more determinative on this issue was that despite the plaintiff stating that the defendant “went against traffic flow” in his police report,[^48] the police investigated and took no action.[^49]

40     While the plaintiff’s counsel in his closing submissions had raised issues about the defendant’s defence, it must be borne in mind that the burden continued to remain on the plaintiff to prove his case on a balance of probabilities. As Steven Chong J in _Goldrich Venture Pte Ltd and another v Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd_ \[2015\] SGHC so aptly put (at \[75\] and \[78\]):

> … both parties’ narratives are riddled with difficulties.

> …

> …\[T\]he difficulties in the defendant’s narrative, however numerous, do not assist the plaintiffs with the proof of its affirmative case. I am not faced with a binary choice between accepting either the plaintiff’s account of events or that of the defendant’s. In other words, rejection of the defendant’s case theory does not invariably entail acceptance of the plaintiff’s.

41     On this issue therefore, I considered that the plaintiff had not proven his case that the defendant was negligent in that he overtook the plaintiff by travelling against the traffic flow.

## Issue 3: Whether there was contact between the parties’ vehicles.

42     Following through with the plaintiff’s case theory, it was the plaintiff’s pleaded case that after the defendant allegedly filtered back to ‘the right lane’ from the lane with opposing traffic, the defendant’s motor car “collided into the Plaintiff’s motor cycle”[^50] at the motorcycle’s right handle.[^51]

43     According to the defendant, the only contact the plaintiff had with his motor car prior to the plaintiff’s confronting him by hitting on the motor car’s bonnet, was when the plaintiff allegedly kicked the left rear bottom of the defendant’s motor car “to move away from \[the defendant’s\] car”.[^52]

44     It was admitted by the plaintiff that he wobbled, jam-braked, skidded and fell forward.[^53] It was also the defendant’s observation that the plaintiff had swerved right, saw the defendant’s motor car and the plaintiff lost control of his motorcycle.[^54]

45     So was the plaintiff’s fall as a result of an impact with the defendant’s motor car, or was it because the plaintiff was startled to see the defendant’s motor car looming up as it was the plaintiff’s evidence that he did not see the defendant’s motor car before he filtered?[^55] That was the question this court had to grapple with when presented with the evidence. Of course, once again, the burden of proof remained on the plaintiff to prove this on a balance of probabilities.

46     It was not disputed that there were no other markings or damage on the defendant’s white Hyundai motor car except for what looked like a black print of a footwear at the rear bumper area of the defendant’s car.[^56] The plaintiff’s footwear was captured in the scene photograph.[^57] Whilst the plaintiff had alluded to the contact as a slight impact,[^58] it was also the plaintiff’s pleaded case that the defendant was “\[d\]riving at an excessive speed in the circumstances”.[^59] In his closing submissions, the plaintiff had also referred to the defendant “quickly filter\[ing\] into the right lane”.[^60] If that was the situation, it would be reasonable to expect a mark on the defendant’s car where there was the alleged contact. However, there was none.

47     In view of the absence of any evidence to corroborate the plaintiff in his assertion that the impact with the defendant’s motor car caused his fall, this court was unable to find that the plaintiff had proven his case on a balance of probabilities.

48     It would, instead, be reasonable to explain that the plaintiff having noticed that the black Mercedes vehicle had stopped or slowed down, it prepared to filter. However, he failed to notice the defendant’s motor car. When he filtered to the right lane, he was taken aback when the defendant’s motor car drove up. Surprised, and perhaps also agitated, the plaintiff kicked the defendant’s car. With so much happening, the plaintiff lost control of his motorcycle and that resulted in his fall, and consequently caused his injuries and damage to his motorcycle.

49     It is therefore my finding on this issue that there was no contact between the defendant’s motorcar and the plaintiff’s motorcycle. I should add that it was _not_ pleaded before me that despite there being no contact between the two vehicles, the defendant was nevertheless negligent in the management of his vehicle so as to cause the plaintiff to sustain the injuries and damages. I therefore make no finding from this angle.

50     Once again, I was unable to find in the plaintiff’s favour on this issue as the evidence in support was mostly absent.

## Conclusion

51     In my oral judgment, I had opined that the plaintiff’s closing submissions were largely based on how incredible the defendant’s case was, instead of establishing the plaintiff’s own case. I reiterate that even if this court was incredulous at the defendant’s case – and this court was not – the plaintiff would still have to prove his case on a balance of probabilities. This, the plaintiff had regrettably failed to do.

52     As sympathetic as this court might be towards the plaintiff for his injuries, it would be apt for me to conclude by quoting the words of the learned V K Rajah JC, as he then was, in the case of _Cheong Ghim Fah and another v Murugian s/o Rangasamy_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 19</span> (at \[30\]):

> It is axiomatic that in negligence cases, as in all other civil cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff to establish facts that will precipitate a decision in his favour. Our courts deal with facts and do not base their decisions on considerations of sympathy.

53     The findings of fact by this court supported the decision that the plaintiff’s claims be dismissed.

54     Cost was awarded in the defendant’s favour at S$4,500, with reasonable disbursements and GST (if applicable). This was after taking into consideration both counsel’s cost submissions and factors such as the level of complexity of the case, the duration of the trial and the nature of the claim.
