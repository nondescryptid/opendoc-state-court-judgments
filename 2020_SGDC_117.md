### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## Introduction

1       This is the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant for damages for, amongst other things, trespassing and for items of her belongings which went missing during her term of tenancy at the defendant’s property. Her alternative claim is in negligence; that the defendant owed her a duty of care to ensure that her belongings did not go missing.

2       The defendant counterclaims for, amongst other items, unpaid rent and interest.

3       As I considered the facts to be pertinent in this case, I have taken care to set them out in some detail.

## Facts[^1]

### The Tenancy Agreement

4       The defendant is the owner of an apartment unit at 38 St Thomas Walk (“**the Unit**”). On or about 15 September 2016, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a 2-year tenancy agreement (“**Tenancy Agreement**”) for the plaintiff to lease the Unit from the defendant from 17 October 2016 at a monthly rent of S$3,500.

5       By the terms of the Tenancy Agreement,[^2] save for “\[t\]he first payment of rent \[which was\] “payable on the signing of th\[e\] Agreement”, [^3] the plaintiff was to pay the rent of the subsequent months “monthly in advance without deduction whatsoever on the 17th day of each month”.[^4]

6       Also pursuant to the Tenancy Agreement, the plaintiff paid the defendant a deposit of S$5,000 “as security against the breach of any term or condition of th\[e\] Agreement”.[^5] It was also provided in the Tenancy Agreement that the “deposit shall not be utilised as set-off for any rent due and payable during the currency of th\[e\] Agreement”.[^6]

### Late rent payments

7       From the second month of the tenancy, however, it is not disputed that the plaintiff did not observe the due date for payment of the rent:[^7]

> (a)     the rent due and payable on 17 Nov 2016 was paid on 2 Dec 2016;

> (b)     the rent due and payable on 17 Dec 2016 was paid on 3 Jan 2017;

> (c)     the rent due and payable on 17 Jan 2016 was paid on 20 Jan 2017;

> (d)     the rent due and payable on 17 Feb 2016 was paid on 2 Mar 2017;

and so, it went on in that fashion.

### Short rent payments

8       It even came to a point when the rent was not just late. It was also short. Both the plaintiff and the defendant then became unsure for which month or months the incomplete payments were for. However, with the tabulation of the rental payments[^8] for purposes of the trial (information in the table not disputed by the plaintiff), the rental payments could be appropriated as follows:

> (a)     S$3,500 due and payable on 17 May 2017 was satisfied by –

>> (i)       S$1,500 paid on 5 June 2017;

>> (ii)       S$1,500 paid on 6 June 2017; and

>> (iii)       S$ 500 paid on 5 July 2017;

> (b)     S$3,500 due and payable on 17 June 2017 was satisfied by –

>> (i)       S$3,000 paid on 2 August 2017; and

>> (ii)       S$ 500 from the S$2,000 paid on 31 August 2017;

> (c)     S$3,500 due and payable on 17 July 2017 was satisfied by –

>> (i)       S$1,500, being the balance from the S$2,000 paid on 31 August 2017;

>> (ii)       S$1,000 paid on 4 September 2017; and

>> (iii)       S$1,000 from the S$2,000 paid on 5 September 2017;

> (d)     S$3,5000 due and payable on 17 August 2017 was satisfied by –

>> (i)       S$1,000, being the balance from the S$2,000 paid on 5 September 2017; and

>> (ii)       S$2,500 from the S$3,500 paid on 29 September 2017;

and so, this pattern continued.

### Notices of demand (28 August 2017) and repossession (2 October 2017)

9       In his affidavit, the defendant deposed that he made demands of the plaintiff for the outstanding rents. On 28 August 2017, the defendant issued the plaintiff a “Notice of Demand”[^9] (“**28 August Demand Notice”**). The 28 August Demand Notice referred to the plaintiff’s “failure to pay rent due to the Landlord on 17 July 2017 and 17 August 2017, totalling S$7,000.”[^10] It also mentioned the interest that is due on the late payments provided for in clause 4(b) of the Tenancy Agreement.

10     The 28 August Demand Notice also required the plaintiff to ‘rectify the breach’ (my paraphrase) within the next four days. It is noted that on 31 August 2017, the plaintiff paid the defendant S$2,000. However, the Court further noted that this S$2,000 still did not satisfy the rents which were earlier due on 17 July 2017 and 17 August 2017. Demands for rent payment therefore continued, including on 17 September 2017 and 1 October 2017.[^11]

11     On 2 October 2017, the defendant issued the plaintiff what he had referred to in his affidavit[^12] as a “Notice of Repossession”[^13] (“**2 October Repossession Notice**”). In this 2 October Repossession Notice, the defendant referred to the plaintiff’s “failure to pay rent due to the Landlord on 17 July 2017 and 17 August 2017, totalling S$7,000.”[^14]

12     The defendant also engaged his own locksmith to change the lock of the Unit “to keep Yu-Ling out of the Unit”.[^15] However, 2 days later on 4 October 2017, the defendant learnt that the plaintiff had “engaged her own locksmith (without \[the defendant’s\] permission or knowledge) \[and\] unlock\[ed\] the Unit in order to continue occupying the Unit.”[^16] From thence, as the defendant had not made available the key to the new lock to the plaintiff, it was not disputed that the plaintiff “continued to occupy the Unit with the main door unlocked.”[^17]

### Subletting without “written consent”

13     Despite what happened on 2 October 2017, the plaintiff continued to be late in paying her rent, and the defendant continued to make demands for the rent. In mid-December 2017, the defendant also discovered that the plaintiff had sublet a room in the Unit without his “written consent”[^18] as was required under clause 2(t) of the Tenancy Agreement.

14     On 29 December 2017, the defendant issued another “Notice of Repossession” [^19] to the plaintiff (“**29 December Repossession Notice**”). In this 29 December Repossession Notice, the defendant made reference to the plaintiff’s late payment of rent and her subletting of a room in the Unit without the defendant’s consent. The plaintiff was given notice to “evict from \[the Unit\]… by 1 January 2018… or on a later date as agreeable by the Landlord, subject to the Landlord’s consent in his sole discretion.”[^20]

15     The plaintiff did not move out of the Unit on 1 January 2018. On 2 January 2018, she made a payment of S$3,000 to the defendant. Again, this was not enough to clear her outstanding rent. Angry text messages continued to be exchanged between the parties.

### The 26 January 2018 Meeting and after

16     On 26 January 2018, “at around 1.30pm…”,[^21] the parties met to discuss the situation (“**26 January Meeting**”). Following from the meeting, according to the plaintiff, “Dominic and I agreed…”[^22] and the plaintiff went on to enumerate what they both allegedly agreed:[^23]

> (a)    My lease of the Unit would end on 25 February 2018.

> (b)    Before the end of my lease on 25 February 2018, I would be entitled to my full rights as tenant of the Unit, including my right to quiet enjoyment of the Unit.

> (c)    Before the end of my lease on 25 February 2018, I would try my best to pay the outstanding rent for January 2018 to Dominic as soon as possible. However, I made it clear to Dominic – and Dominic agreed – that my moving out date of 25 February 2018 was not conditional upon my immediate payment of the outstanding rent.

17     The plaintiff further deposed in her affidavit[^24] that at the 26 January Meeting, she also reminded the defendant about the S$5,000 deposit that she had paid him pursuant to the Tenancy Agreement. She was of the view that that would be sufficient to cover the 17 January 2018 rent.

18     Contrary to the plaintiff’s version of the story regarding the outstanding rent with the moving out date, it was the defendant’s position that the plaintiff “could stay in the Unit until 25 February 2018 provided that she made **immediate payment of S$3,500**”[^25] (emphasis in original).

19     It was also not disputed that after the 26 January Meeting, the defendant sent the plaintiff the following WhatsApp messages:[^26]

> 26/01/2018, 14:08 - dominiclimkg: Yuling, this is to confirm moving out on 25 Feb and handling \[_sic_\] back to me the unit. Thanks.

> 26/01/2018, 14:13 - dominclimkg: We have the discussion earlier and thanks for confirming the date. Please also settle the overdue rental for amount of S$3.5k immediately. Thanks.

> 26/01/2018, 14:36 - dominiclimkg: Just to put on record that the 25 Feb date is your proposed date and will be the agreed date by both parties.

20     After the discussion of the 26 January Meeting, the rent continued to remain outstanding. On 29 January 2018, the defendant asked for an update on the arrears of rent.[^27] On 30 January 2018, when the defendant still did not receive any rent, he sent a WhatsApp message to the plaintiff, timestamped 6.43pm saying, “I WILL LOCK UP THIS UNIT FROM TOM \[(tomorrow)\] ONWARDS !” \[Uppercase in original.\]

### The locking up of the Unit – 4 February 2018

21     On 3 February 2018, the defendant learnt that the plaintiff was overseas.[^28] The plaintiff had in fact travelled to Malaysia on Friday, 2 February 2018.[^29] According to the plaintiff,[^30] she was overseas in Kuala Lumpur to renew her employment pass and “was planning to stay \[there\] only for the weekend and return to Singapore thereafter”. That evening, at about 10.17pm, the defendant sent the plaintiff a WhatsApp message which reads: “I AM NOW GIVING YOU THE NOTICE OF REPOSSION \[_sic_\]”.[^31] (Uppercase in original.) There were a few text message exchanges and at 12.04am of 4 February 2018, the defendant messaged the plaintiff, “I HAVE TAKEN BACK THE UNIT. …”[^32] \[Uppercase again in original.\] The plaintiff was still overseas then.

22     In the evening of 4 February 2018, the parties made arrangement for the defendant to pick the plaintiff up that evening from the airport and to return to the Unit together. However, despite the defendant being at the airport from about 10.30pm to 11.30pm, he did not get to meet the plaintiff. It turned out that the plaintiff was denied entry into Singapore _via_ tourist visa and had to return to Kuala Lumpur to wait for her employment pass to be renewed.[^33]

### The S$2,000 to be paid by 8 February 2018

23     The issue of the plaintiff occupying the Unit until 25 February 2018 was again brought up on 5 February 2018. The plaintiff understood the defendant to be concerned that she might not be able to return to Singapore and move out of the Unit by 25 February 2018.[^34] The plaintiff was anxious that the defendant should not touch her things until she returned to Singapore.[^35] Through WhatsApp messages, the defendant negotiated that the plaintiff should “TT \[(telegraphic transfer)\] S$2k to \[his\] account to have assurance \[the Unit\] is available”[^36] and that the plaintiff would have “TILL \[that\] Thursday \[that is, 8 February 2018\] to arrange the payment”[^37] (emphasis in original).

24     In his affidavit, the defendant deposed about the occasion when the plaintiff sought his assistance to make his Unit accessible for viewing for purposes of subletting:[^38]

> On 8 February 2018, instead of making payment, Yu-ling blatantly attempted to sublet a room in the Unit despite knowing that the Tenancy Agreement did not permit this. Yu-ling even had the audacity to ask me to open the door to the Unit to allow her housing agent and a potential subtenant to view the Unit…

The defendant did not accede to the plaintiff’s request for assistance.

25     No S$2,000 came in from the plaintiff on 8 February 2018. In fact, no payment came in at all from the plaintiff that day.

### The “Notice of Repossession” – 9 February 2018

26     On 9 February 2018, the defendant issued the plaintiff a “Notice of Repossession”[^39] by way of a WhatsApp message (“**9 February Repossession Notice**”). In the 9 February Repossession Notice, the defendant made reference to, _inter alia_, the plaintiff’s habitual late and short payments of rent and his reminders to her, the interest that was chargeable on the late payments, and her “unauthorised subletting”[^40]. He therefore gave notice of the repossession.

27     Although the 9 February Repossession Notice stated that the repossession was “with effect from 8 February 2018…”,[^41] in his affidavit he corrected “8 February 2018” to “9 February 2019”. The defendant deposed that that was a typographical error.[^42] He re-confirmed this when in the witness box[^43] but also further re-re-confirmed that his affidavit correcting the date from “8 February 2018” to “9 February 2019”[^44] was also wrong.[^45] The date of the repossession should rightly be 9 February 2018, and the defendant finally corrected this from the witness box.

### Removal of the plaintiff’s belongings and after

28     According to the defendant, on 10 February 2018, he engaged and paid one Lee Wee Seng of Seng Tat Impex (“**the movers**”) to pack the plaintiff’s belongings into boxes and remove them from the Unit to a warehouse.[^46] The defendant claimed that he was “personally present at the Unit” when that was being carried out.[^47]

29     On 12 February 2018, the defendant received S$2,000 transferred to his account on the plaintiff’s behalf.[^48] This was not disputed. The plaintiff was still in Kuala Lumpur then.[^49] On 15 February 2018, the defendant sent the plaintiff a “Confirmation of Repossession” (“**15 February Confirmation**”).[^50] In the 15 February Confirmation, the defendant confirmed that the Unit had been repossessed. The 15 February Confirmation also stated:[^51]

> Your personal belongings and items… are stored at a warehouse pending your further instruction for collection. Upon receipt of your request, the Landlord will arrange for them to be delivered to your designated location in Singapore for your collection. The Landlord understands that you are currently prevented from entering into Singapore. Hence upon confirmation of your clearance by the Singapore immigration department to return to Singapore, please contact the Landlord to arrange for the delivery of your personal belongings and items to your designated location for your collection.

30     The plaintiff returned to Singapore from Kuala Lumpur on 23 February 2018. On that day and the days following, she repeatedly asked for the location of and the key to the warehouse as she wanted to “take \[her\] stuff”[^52] and “to check if \[her\] belongings damaged \[_sic_\] or missing”[^53]. The defendant repeatedly asked her to provide the forwarding address to send her “stuff” to as he himself did not have access to the warehouse.

31     On 1 March 2018, the defendant sent the plaintiff a “Reminder Notice On Retrieval of Personal Items and Used Furniture”.[^54] He referred to the warehousing costs and his not receiving any assurance from the plaintiff that she would bear the cost. He therefore gave the plaintiff –[^55]

> Up to 2 weeks… To furnish the Landlord with the designated location for the delivery of these stored items to you. In the event the Landlord does not hear from you to the satisfactory, the Landlord shall assume that you chose to abandon these stored items and will instruct the mover to treat them as unwanted items and to dispose them \[_sic_\] accordingly. (Emphases omitted.)

### The Tiffany bracelet & other “lost” items in the police report

32     On 8 March 2018, the plaintiff made a police report[^56] “regarding \[the defendant’s\] wrongful detention of \[her\] belongings and refusal to return them to \[her\]”[^57] (“**8 March Police Report**”). This was the plaintiff’s third police report. (For the record, the defendant had also made various police reports prior to 8 March 2018.) In this 8 March Police Report, the plaintiff gave a list of items which were described as “Lost”.[^58]

33     For purposes of the present case, the items notably described as “lost” were –

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="6.77728908436625%"> <col width="26.1695321871252%"> <col width="10.3958416633347%"> <col width="15.953618552579%"> <col width="4.55817672930828%"> <col width="18.2327069172331%"> <col width="17.9128348660536%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">19</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Jewellery</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lost</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Tiffany</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">[S$150]</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 Tiffany bracelet</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">General Property</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lost</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ferragamo</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">[S$3,000]</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 pairs of Ferragamo shoes</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

(Table and columns are as in Original. Note: The columns in the above table have no header.)

34     In her affidavit, the plaintiff clarified that the value of the Tiffany bracelet was “mistakenly \[written\]” as S$150.[^59] However, she had amended the record to S$150,000, being the price at which the bracelet was purchased by her then boyfriend. It was a gift to her.[^60] It should be mentioned that the plaintiff did not produce the amended police report in general discovery. It was only in the course of the trial that the plaintiff produced evidence of this amended police report and in the form of a photo image[^61]. The plaintiff gave evidence under affirmation that the correction was made on the same day, 8 March 2018.[^62]

### The joint inspection, the Tiffany bracelet and the “lost” items

35     The plaintiff did not get to inspect her belongings at the warehouse despite her requests. She also did not accept the defendant’s counsel’s counter-proposal for the inspection to be conducted “at the ground floor carpark of the Unit or at a location designated by \[the plaintiff\]”[^63].

36     It was finally only on 12 April 2018, that the plaintiff had the opportunity to inspect her belongings. It was arranged to be at the Unit.

37     A day before the scheduled joint inspection, plaintiff’s counsel sent the defendant’s counsel “an inventory list of \[the plaintiff’s\] belongings that were in the Unit prior to \[the defendant’s\] unlawful re-entry in early February 2018.”[^64] The following items listed are noteworthy:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.24%"> <col width="78.4%"> <col width="11.36%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Accessories and Jewellery</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Tiffany diamond bracelet</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">---</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Shoes</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">37.</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ferragamo heels (Colours: red, skin, navy and black)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

38     In the course of the joint inspection on 12 April 2018, the plaintiff spotted the familiar blue elongated Tiffany box. She deposed in her affidavit:[^65]

> …when I saw the blue Tiffany box, I fully expected my Tiffany bracelet to be in the box. However, when I opened it, I was shocked to find it empty. I shouted immediately that it is “_empty_”. I was very angry and worried that someone might have stolen the bracelet (italics in original).

39     The plaintiff “continued searching the same carton box frantically, hoping to find the diamond bracelet inside”.[^66] But she did not. The bracelet was also not inside a spare Tiffany box which she found in the same carton. As the plaintiff deposed of the spare Tiffany box, “I expected even before opening \[the spare Tiffany box\] that it would be empty and commented aloud that it must be empty.”[^67]

40     According to the plaintiff, she “opened each carton box in \[the defendant\]’s presence and checked whether \[her\] belongings were intact”.[^68] According to the defendant, however, some of the carton boxes contained storage boxes which the plaintiff had “refused to open… and insisted that they were empty”[^69] (emphasis in original).

41     This Court had the benefit of viewing a video of a segment of the joint inspection which video was played during the trial.

42     In the weeks following the joint inspection, the plaintiff claimed that she combed through her carton boxes which were moved into her warehouse, but was unable to find the Tiffany bracelet.[^70] She also subsequently recalled that the defendant did not return to her her red Ferragamo shoes, her Leica camera and Apple television (“**Apple TV**”). Hence, this suit.

## The claim and counterclaim

43     In her Closing Submissions, the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for the value of the following missing items:[^71]

>   
| 

(a)

 | 

Tiffany diamond bracelet

 | 

S$ 176,000;

 |
| 

(b)

 | 

Leica camera

 | 

S$ 1,000;

 |
| 

(c)

 | 

Apple television

 | 

S$ 300; and

 |
| 

(d)

 | 

Red Ferragamo shoes

 | 

S$ 1,000.

 |

  
  

44     The plaintiff also asks this Court to dismiss the defendant’s claims and to allow the following in the plaintiff’s favour –

> (a)     damages for trespass at an amount equivalent to unpaid rent, and she has quantified this at S$2,693.35;

> (b)     damages for loss of use of items and inconvenience at S$1,500; and

> (c)     return of the Security Deposit of S$5,000 and the S$2,000 paid to the defendant on 12 February 2018.[^72]

45     In his Closing Submissions, the defendant urges the Court to dismiss the plaintiff’s claims “in its entirety” and to allow his counterclaims against the plaintiff for –[^73]

> (a)     the outstanding rent from 17 January 2018 to 4 February 2018, at S$2,145.16;

> (b)     interests for the late rent payments amounting to S$765.28; and

> (c)     the to-and-fro costs of transporting the plaintiff’s belongings between the warehouse and the Unit, at S$900, which sum includes the cost of warehousing (“**transport and warehousing expenses**”).

## Issues

46     The issues this Court has to decide are:

> (a)     Were the Tiffany bracelet and the other “lost” items in the Unit when the defendant came to lock up the Unit on 4 February 2018?

> (b)     If they were, was the defendant negligent in failing to ensure that the items did not go missing?

> (c)     Was the defendant’s re-entry into the Unit lawful?

## The claim

### Issue 1: Were the Tiffany bracelet and the other “lost” items in the Unit when the defendant came to lock up the Unit on 4 February 2018?

47     The other “lost” items that the plaintiff claims for, besides the Tiffany bracelet, are the earlier stated Leica camera, Apple TV and red Ferragamo shoes. These items have not been recovered.

48     The plaintiff and defendant agree that 4 February 2018 was considered the relevant date. This was the day the defendant came to the Unit and re-entered it, according to the plaintiff; or locked it up, according to the defendant.[^74] In his affidavit, the defendant had deposed[^75], “On the morning of 4 February 2018, I locked the Unit and informed \[the plaintiff\] that “I have taken back the Unit” (emphasis in original).

49     This was further confirmed by the defendant when he was cross-examined on it, and also his understanding of what it is:[^76]

> Q:    … First and foremost, what is your position as to when you re-entered the unit? _Which date did you re-enter the unit?_

> A:     _4 February._

> Q:     _You re-entered the unit on 4 February?_

> A:     _I lock up the unit, actually. I lock up the unit. Maybe I use the word I lock up the unit._

> Q:    You lock up the unit on 4 February. But before you locked up the unit, did you not enter her unit to have a look at the state of the unit?

> A:    No, on 4 February I entered, and before I lock up I just ensure that nobody is around in the house, just to ensure that, otherwise somebody is in the house.

> Q:     _So you walked through the premises of the unit, the premises inside, before you locked it up?_

> A:     _No, I was just at -- just after the front door_, to ensure that the lights are off, there's nobody in the house, so before I locked it up.

> Q:    Right. _So you never entered the unit at all on the 4th? Is that your evidence?_

> A:    Okay. _When I say "entered" meaning just basically, just come in after the door._

> Q:    You did, didn't you? Enter through the door of that premises? On the 4th?

> A:    If it's on that basis, yes, it is.

> Q:     _And did you not walk through to see that there is nobody inside?_

> A:    The lights are off, so I was -- and _I basically shouted and to ask, is there anybody in the house, before I lock it up._

> Q:    What time was that?

> A:    It was quite late. I would say just past – almost around midnight.

> (Emphasis added.)

50     The pertinent dates this Court takes cognisance of are:

> (a)     2 February 2018 – when the plaintiff left the Unit and went to Kuala Lumpur and was there for about 3 weeks until 23 February;

> (b)     4 February 2018 – when the defendant came to the Unit and locked it up;

> (c)     8 February 2018 – when the defendant made arrangements with the movers to move the plaintiff’s belongings out from the Unit. The defendant took photographs of the defendant’s belongings on this day and sent the same to the movers;

> (d)     10 February 2018 – according to the defendant,[^77] this was the day when the movers came to remove the plaintiff’s belongings from the Unit; and

> (e)     12 April 2018 – the day of the joint discovery when the defendant realised that some of her belongings were “lost”.

51     For the plaintiff to succeed in this claim of the missing items, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove her case on a balance of probabilities. What this means was submitted most prescriptively by plaintiff’s counsel in their Closing Submissions,[^78] with reference to Pinsler SC (ed), _Evidence and the Litigation Process_ (2010, LexisNexis), at paras 12.87 and 12.88:

> In a civil case, the plaintiff has to show that he is more likely to be right about his case. Mathematically quantified, the plaintiff has to establish his case on the basis of 50+%. In determining whether the plaintiff has discharged the burden, the court is required to consider whether his case is more likely true on a balance of probabilities.

52     Of the missing items, the focus had been on the Tiffany bracelet, mainly because of its value, at at least S$150,000. I shall therefore deal with the Tiffany bracelet separately from the rest of the missing items.

#### The Tiffany bracelet

53     On 12 April 2018 when the carton containing the plaintiff’s belongings was opened, it is not disputed that the bracelet was not in the Tiffany box. It was also not to be found anywhere in the carton it was kept in, or amongst the other cartons and boxes that the plaintiff opened during the joint inspection.

54     It is also not disputed that on 8 February 2018 when the defendant sent a picture of the plaintiff’s belongings to the movers, the Tiffany box could be seen in the plaintiff’s wardrobe.[^79] There were in fact 2 such Tiffany boxes. The 2 Tiffany boxes were also retrieved when the carton box was opened.

##### (1)   The plaintiff was unsure _when_ she last saw the bracelet

55     At re-examination, the plaintiff was asked when she last saw the bracelet. Although she replied that it would be “the end of January / the beginning of February. Around there”,[^80] she was hesitant. She in fact admitted during cross-examination that she had no evidence that the bracelet was in the Unit on 2 February 2018, just before she left for Kuala Lumpur:[^81]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

… you have absolutely no evidence to show that your bracelet was in the \[U\]nit on 2 February 2018. You’ve got absolutely no evidence. You can agree or disagree with me, but I have to put that to you.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

I would really like to prove –

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Just respond to the question, please.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

I do not know.

 |

  
  

56     There is therefore no evidence that the plaintiff knew for certain or did actually see the bracelet prior to her leaving for Kuala Lumpur. While the Court can accept that she might have seen the boxes, but in order to prove her case, it was crucial for the plaintiff to persuade the Court that the bracelet was _inside_ the signature blue Tiffany box. It was not enough for the plaintiff to merely assert, without more, that “\[b\]efore \[she\] left for Kuala Lumpur, as \[she\] was arranging \[her\] things, the bracelet was still neatly placed in \[her\] wardrobe, in a box”[^82] when there was no evidence that she actually cast her eyes on them.

##### (2)   The defendant’s arguments

57     The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the bracelet was not in the Unit at the relevant time. These arguments include the following:[^83]

> (a)     the photographs which were meant to show the plaintiff to have possession of the bracelet predate even the start of the tenancy on 17 October 2016;

> (b)     even if the bracelet was in the Unit before the plaintiff left for Kuala Lumpur (which was denied), the plaintiff had not shown that it was in the Unit on 2 February 2018 after the plaintiff left for Kuala Lumpur and before the defendant came to lock the Unit on 4 February 2018;[^84]

> (c)     the plaintiff’s own conduct showed that the bracelet could not have been in the Unit at the relevant time. It was an expensive item and the plaintiff had admitted that she made no mention of it in any of her communications or WhatsApp exchanges with the defendant.[^85] It was not even mentioned when the defendant had referred to the plaintiff’s belongings as “rubbish”[^86] and so, a risk of her belongings being discarded.[^87] In fact, the plaintiff admitted at cross-examination that the first time she mentioned it was in her 9 March Police Report;[^88] and

> (d)     despite the plaintiff making 2 police reports on 23 February 2018,[^89] both reports made no reference to the plaintiff’s presumably most expensive and “most prized possession”[^90]. This was also in spite of her claiming to have mentioned “jewellery or cash”[^91] or “valuable items”[^92] to the Police.[^93]

58     The defendant even suggested that the plaintiff had “belatedly manufactured a scheme in an attempt to falsely claim the value of the Bracelet from the defendant”.[^94] The defendant highlighted WhatsApp exchanges where the plaintiff had warned the defendant that “valuables... will be deemed lost by \[the defendant\] if they are found to be missing”[^95] and that she would “claim from \[the defendant\]”.[^96]

59     I have found this last-mentioned argument difficult to swallow, as the parties had been communicating in this manner after their initial friendliness[^97] with each other had turned to hostility. The threats, the ultimatums, angry exchanges, the calling of names, these were all captured in the WhatsApp exchanges. I therefore do not consider it so unusual or extraordinary as to tantamount to a scheme when the plaintiff said that she would make the defendant accountable to her for any loss and forewarned him so.

60     This Court is, instead, struck by the fact that a day before the joint inspection, the plaintiff had requested for a valuation of the Tiffany bracelet.[^98] It was as if the plaintiff already knew that it would be missing and was getting the valuation in preparation for a showdown with the defendant. So, if there should be any suggestion of any scheme to raise a false claim against the defendant for the loss of the Tiffany bracelet, I would consider this the more suspicious act.

61     The defendant had argued that since the bracelet was not mentioned in the two police reports made on 23 February 2018, this meant that the bracelet was not in the Unit at the relevant time. I preferred plaintiff’s counsel’s suggestion to look at the factual context instead –[^99]

> When she was finally able to return to Singapore \[on 23 February 2018\]… she was without her personal belongings, clothes, shoes, without a place to stay and without sufficient funds to afford alternative accommodation at that point in time.

From her WhatsApp messages to the defendant, she was frustrated and anxious to get her things. The tension was likely magnified as the plaintiff had an event the day after for which she needed her clothes, shoes, and other personal items.[^100] She had also just arrived from Kuala Lumpur that day. It is noticed that her police reports of 23 February 2018, had the time recorded as 20.12pm[^101] and 8.52pm[^102]. Under those circumstances, it was not unreasonable to consider that the plaintiff was too highly-strung or tense to have noticed that the bracelet was not mentioned in the reports. Besides, the principal points of the reports pertained to the accommodation – or lack of – more than anything else. I am therefore not persuaded by the defendant’s arguments on this point.

62     The defendant also submitted that the bracelet could not have been in the Unit between 2-4 February 2018 as otherwise the plaintiff would have mentioned it to the defendant at some point of her many WhatsApp messages to the defendant, particularly when the defendant had referred to her belongings as “rubbish”. Contrary to defendant’s counsel’s interpretation of the situation, I agree with plaintiff’s counsel that as the plaintiff was stuck overseas, it was more prudent to not have mentioned about the bracelet. Mentioning it or its value “would \[indeed\] have increased \[the plaintiff’s\] exposure and the likelihood of it being stolen”.[^103]

63     However, on the others of the defendant’s arguments abovementioned, the Court accepts that they create a doubt on whether the Tiffany bracelet was in the Unit at the relevant time.

##### (3)   Photographs of the plaintiff wearing the bracelet were too predated

64     The photographs showing the plaintiff wearing the bracelet were indeed too predated to be useful for the plaintiff’s case. None was dated close to 2 February 2018, that is, around the time the plaintiff claimed to have seen the bracelet. The four photographs were dated 12 October 2014, 16 October 2014, 25 May 2015, and 24 October 2015,[^104] predating even the commencement of the tenancy. There were even no photographs that were produced to show the existence of the bracelet _during_ the tenancy period. All that the photographs were proof of, is that the plaintiff had the bracelet at the time of the photographs, that is, in 2014 and 2015.

65     I would agree with plaintiff’s counsel that it “cannot be right”[^105] to expect the plaintiff to “have taken a photograph of the Tiffany bracelet in the Unit just before leaving Singapore on 2 February 2018”.[^106] If there was such a photograph, the Court might even consider it contrived. However, there was nothing at all before the Court to suggest that the plaintiff saw the bracelet or any plausible reason why she might have looked at or seen the bracelet before she left for Kuala Lumpur. If there was any evidence at all, the Court might be persuaded on a “50+%” that the bracelet was present in the Unit on 2 February 2018. However, there was no such evidence. The Court only has the evidence that before the plaintiff left for Kuala Lumpur, the Tiffany box was neatly sitting on her shelf. It then should not surprise that the Tiffany box was found inside the carton at the joint inspection.

66     The plaintiff’s bare assertion regarding the Tiffany bracelet was only enough for the Court to draw the conclusion that the plaintiff had merely noticed, at most, the Tiffany boxes and not its contents.

##### (4)   No evidence that the bracelet was in the Unit on 2-4 February 2018

67     It is not in dispute that after the defendant locked the Unit the first time on 2 October 2017, the plaintiff was not provided with a key to the Unit. The defendant continued to occupy the Unit without it being locked.

68     Through the cross-examination, defendant’s counsel tried to show that there were other people who also accessed the Unit before 2 February 2018: around 31 March 2017 there was a Korean girl,[^107] a friend visiting from Kuala Lumpur around 5 April 2017,[^108] an electrician on 21 October 2017,[^109] a “water seepage man”,[^110] and even a subtenant.

69     However, according to the plaintiff, whilst she had all these persons who came to and went from the Unit, she was present on all those occasions. Even with the subtenant, they would “sometimes go to work and knock off from work together”.[^111] It was also the plaintiff’s position that “\[a\]ll these was before \[the defendant\] re-entered, and there were never any incidents of theft. …\[B\]efore the re-entering, I never lost anything.”[^112] The plaintiff even volunteered the information that “\[f\]or my neighbours, they even left their doors open when they slept. They did not lock the doors.”[^113] It seemed that the neighbours did not even close their doors when they slept.[^114] It should be heartening to hear the plaintiff, a Taiwanese, express such faith in Singapore’s security when she said, “In Singapore, security is very good. It’s internationally renowned.”[^115] However, it was also the plaintiff’s evidence that her room would be “locked occasionally when guests come”.[^116]

70     So, the plaintiff would either mostly be with the visitors to the Unit, or would lock her room. Also, the bracelet was in the walk-in wardrobe which wardrobe was situated at “the innermost part of the house, so you enter and you walk right in. …It’s the innermost part of the house. …\[I\]nside \[the plaintiff’s\] bedroom.”[^117] It therefore appears that as long as the plaintiff was present, her bracelet – if it were in the Unit – would be safe since it would be difficult for anyone to access the area of her walk-in wardrobe if the plaintiff was in the Unit.

71     However, the situation was likely to be different when the plaintiff was not around. At re-examination the plaintiff confirmed this, and particularly when her doors were not locked:

> Q:     _You mentioned earlier this morning that you lock your bedroom._ Can I ask –

> A:     _But for this time round when I leave the house, I did not lock the door._ Only when there were guests, I would lock the door.

> Q:     _Can I clarify, when you say "but for this time round", what are you referring to?_

> A:     _I was referring to when I left for Kuala Lumpur, I was in a rush, so I did not manage to lock._

> Q:    Okay. And when you do actually lock the room door, who has the key?

> A:    Only I have the key, and the landlord.

> (Emphasis added.)

72     So, the evidence before me was that the plaintiff’s door to the Unit was not locked. Her bedroom door was also not locked. She left the house on 2 February 2018. Anyone who enters the unlocked main door to the Unit, and with the plaintiff absent and no one inside the Unit, could walk all the way into the bedroom, which door was also not locked, and to the wardrobe in the innermost part of the house. This was the state of the security of the Unit when the plaintiff was in Kuala Lumpur and before 4 February 2018.

73     So, _even if_ the bracelet was in the Unit as at 2 February 2018 – which was not proven – can one confidently say, on a balance of probabilities, that the bracelet was still in the Unit on 4 February 2018?

74     It is trite but still warrants a reminder that even if _all_ of the defendant’s arguments fail to raise a credible defence, the legal burden would still remain with the plaintiff to prove her case on a balance of probabilities. Perhaps this is most aptly put by the High Court in _Goldrich Venture Pte Ltd and another v Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd_ \[2015\] SGHC103 at \[75\] and \[78\]:

> … both parties’ narratives are riddled with difficulties. …\[T\]he difficulties in the defendant’s narrative, however numerous, do not assist the plaintiffs with the proof of its affirmative case. I am not faced with a binary choice between accepting either the plaintiff’s account of events or that of the defendant’s. In other words, rejection of the defendant’s case theory does not invariably entail acceptance of the plaintiff’s.

75     In the present case, the Court finds that the plaintiff has not proven her case that her bracelet was in the Unit prior to the defendant’s coming to the Unit to lock it up on 4 February 2018. The plaintiff was not even sure when she last saw the bracelet. There was in fact no evidence of such at all, as was also earlier mentioned. Even if the defendant fails on all points raised in his defence, the Court is not bound to accept the plaintiff’s version. It rests upon the plaintiff to discharge her burden of proof. As it is, the defendant, to some extent, managed to further weaken the plaintiff’s case on this issue. So, as sympathetic as this Court may be to the plaintiff’s loss of a beautiful diamond jewellery, the evidence supports the findings reached.

#### The other “lost” items

76     The other items that the plaintiff seeks to claim from the defendant are: (a) a Leica camera; (b) an Apple TV; and (c) a pair of red Ferragomo shoes. Very little was submitted by the plaintiff on the claim for these items.

77     defendant’s counsel had first ascertained from the plaintiff that the items were all inside the Unit:[^118]

> Q:    These are the photographs of the missing items. Correct?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    These are photographs of the items that were actually inside the apartment?

> A:    Yes.

As it turned out, the items were _not_ inside the Unit.

78     The photos the plaintiff tendered in an attempt to show that the items were in the Unit failed to achieve their objective. Photographs dated 9 March 2017 showing the right side of a red Ferragamo shoe[^119] on a right foot (the left foot was wearing a shoe of a different colour) were admitted by the plaintiff to have been taken “while I was trying the shoes outside the apartment”.[^120] It was unclear whether that meant at another location. What is sufficiently clear, however, is that the Ferragamo shoe or shoes were not inside the Unit.

79     Photographs of the Apple TV[^121] as evidence to support the plaintiff’s case failed even more miserably during cross-examination. It was not only not taken in her apartment, it was not even her Apple TV:[^122]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

… Can you turn to page 264 of your affidavit. This is, I believe, intended to show an Apple TV. Would that be correct?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, correct.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

_Is this the Apple TV that is connected to the television in the apartment?_

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Actually, this Apple TV was not taken by – by apartment.

 |
| 

INTERPRETER:

 | 

Witness is pointing to the silver bar on page 264.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

_Actually, this is not my TV. I only tried to take a picture to show that my Apple TV looked like this. But this was not the Apple TV at my apartment._

 |
| 

(Emphasis added.)

 |

  
  

80     As for the Leica camera, it was not even mentioned anywhere, and definitely not in the two police reports made on 23 February 2018, or the 8 March police report. For the record, the Apple TV was also not mentioned anywhere. These two items were only raised for purposes of the suit.

81     Like the Tiffany bracelet therefore, there is no evidence that the Ferragamo shoes, the Apple TV and the Leica camera were in the Unit when the defendant came to the Unit on 4 February 2018. I therefore have to agree with the defendant that the plaintiff’s claims against the defendant for these other items also cannot stand.[^123]

82     In short, the plaintiff has failed to discharge her burden of proof on a balance of probabilities that the items were in the Unit before they went missing as a result of the defendant’s actions. Her claims against the defendant for the value of the Tiffany bracelet, the red Ferragamo shoes, the Leica camera or the Apple TV must therefore be dismissed.

### Issue 2: If the items were in the Unit, was the defendant negligent in failing to ensure that the items did not go missing?

83     In the pleading, the plaintiff seeks “\[a\] declaration that the defendant was negligent in failing to ensure that the plaintiff’s belongings were not damaged and did not go missing during the period in which they were in his sole custody.”[^124] For the record, the plaintiff’s case only pertains to the four items that were discussed.

84     The plaintiff’s case presumed that the items were in the Unit, to begin with. It follows from my earlier finding that, since the plaintiff had failed to prove that the Tiffany bracelet and the other items were in the Unit before 2 February 2018, Issue 2 has been rendered redundant.

### Issue 3: Was the defendant’s re-entry into the Unit lawful?

#### The 26 January Meeting – terms of the oral agreement

85     This issue begs the question of what was agreed between the parties at the 26 January Meeting. It is not disputed that the plaintiff and the defendant agreed that the plaintiff should move out of the Unit on 25 February 2018.

86     According to the plaintiff, “Dominic and I agreed…”,[^125] and she went on to enumerate the terms that they had both allegedly agreed on:[^126]

> (a)    My lease of the Unit would end on 25 February 2018.

> (b)    Before the end of my lease on 25 February 2018, I would be entitled to my full rights as tenant of the Unit, including my right to quiet enjoyment of the Unit.

> (c)    Before the end of my lease on 25 February 2018, I would try my best to pay the outstanding rent for January 2018 to Dominic as soon as possible. However, I made it clear to Dominic – _and Dominic agreed_ – that my moving out date of 25 February 2018 was not conditional upon my immediate payment of the outstanding rent.

> (Emphasis added.)

87     According to the defendant, however, the plaintiff being allowed to stay on in the Unit was conditional upon her satisfying the payment for her outstanding rent. The defendant deposed in his affidavit:[^127]

> … we agreed that she could stay in the Unit until 25 February 2018 provided that she made **immediate payment of S$3,500**. After the 26 January meeting, I immediately sent Yu-ling the following WhatsApp messages to record our agreement. I wanted to put our agreement on the record given her past conduct of twisting her words and mine, and reneging on her assurance that she would make repayment: … (emphases in original).

88     The defendant then referred to his WhatsApp messages of 26 January 2018 to the plaintiff immediately after the meeting on the same day of the meeting. In the messages, he had confirmed the date of moving out on 25 February 2018 and also reminded her to “settle the overdue rental for amount of S$3.5k **immediately**”[^128] (emphasis in original).

89     When she was cross-examined, the plaintiff also appeared to the Court to retract from her position on what was agreed between the parties at the 26 January 2018 meeting:[^129]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

_… So you are saying that you told Dominic, "I will not pay my $3,500 rent for January immediately." Is that what you are saying when you say you "made it clear" to Dominic?_

 |
| 

A:

 | 

_No, that was not what I meant._ Over here, _what I meant was –_

 |
| 

INTERPRETER:

 | 

Witness was pointing to paragraph (c) \[of paragraph 16 of her Affidavit\][^130].

 |
| 

A:

 | 

_\-- I would try my best to pay the outstanding rent._

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Oh. Because you used the word "however" in between, so it looked like there were two different things.

 |
| 

 | 

So what you are now saying is actually, it is the same thing. Is that what you are now saying?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

What took place on this day was we agreed that I would try my best to pay the outstanding rent. If I were able to raise the funds, I would pay the rent. We also agreed that the date that I would move out would be 25 February.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So let us be very precise, Ms Chang: _now you are saying that Dominic agreed that you would try your best. Is that it? That's the exact agreement?_

 |
| 

A:

 | 

_I do not have any impression of whether he agreed, but this was what I told him._ That I did not have the money to pay the rent, and if I had the money I would pay him as soon as I could.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

_So it is what you told him; it is not what he agreed to. Is that correct?_

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Because it has been quite long, _I really do not have any impression whether he agreed or not._ But he did agree with me that 25 February will be the date that I moved \[_sic_\] out.

 |
| 

 | 

But after the meeting he did send me text messages -- WhatsApp messages to ask me to pay the outstanding rent of $3,500.

 |
| 

(Emphasis added.)

 |

  
  

90     Given the plaintiff’s own uncertainty as to whether the defendant agreed to her merely trying her best to pay the rent which is still outstanding, the Court cannot be expected to accept that that was the agreement between the parties. What the defendant deposed in her affidavit must therefore be greatly discounted. This Court is, in fact, inclined to accept that the plaintiff’s staying on at the Unit until 25 February 2018 was conditional upon her paying the outstanding rent immediately. I provide other reasons below for my finding.

#### The stay until 25 February 2018 was conditional upon rent payment

##### (1)   Contemporaneous evidence of what was agreed at the 26 January Meeting

91     As discussed, immediately after the 26 January Meeting, the defendant had sent WhatsApp messages to the plaintiff about – (a) their agreed date for the plaintiff to move out of the Unit on 25 February 2018; and (b) to settle the overdue rent.[^131] It would not be far-fetched and would be reasonable to presume that the messages encapsulated the issues discussed at the 26 January Meeting. The WhatsApp communications between the parties on where to meet revealed that they had met at about 1.32pm.[^132] The plaintiff deposed that the meeting “lasted for about 40 minutes”.[^133] The said WhatsApp messages sent from the defendant to the plaintiff were timestamped “14.08” to “14.36”. In his affidavit, the defendant also deposed[^134] that he had “immediately sent”[^135] the plaintiff those WhatsApp messages.

92     In view of the contemporaneity or immediacy of the WhatsApp messages to the meeting , the contents of the WhatsApp messages – particularly the one on rent payment – could not have been an afterthought. If they were, there would be the WhatsApp messages of fresh protests or objections from the plaintiff. But there was none.

##### (2)   The defendant’s behaviour and follow-up actions from the 26 January Meeting

93     The behaviour of the defendant in the days that follow from the 26 January Meeting also suggested that the defendant did not compromise his position on getting the overdue rent from the plaintiff. It in fact shows that his making the Unit available for the plaintiff until 25 February 2018 was conditional and contingent upon her paying the outstanding rent.

94     From 29 January 2018, three days after the 26 January Meeting, the defendant had been sending Whatsapp messages to the plaintiff checking on the payment:[^136]

> 29/01/2018, 14:43 – dominiclimkg: _Please let me know the update from you on rental arrears._

> 29/01/2018, 15:02 – St Thomas Chang Yuling: I m very down and sick to see and reply ur msg now

> 29/01/2018, 15:02 – St Thomas Chang Yuling: Get back to you later

> 30/01/2018, 11:14 – dominiclimkg: You have yet to come back to me. Tom is the last day of the month. _I cannot be waiting and don’t think I will sit here waiting_.

> ….. …..

> 30/01/2018, 18:40 – dominiclimkg: _You signed the rental agreement and want to continue to rent this unit. THANKS JUST PAY!_

> 30/01/2018, 18:41 – dominiclimkg: HOW STUPID CAN ONE GET!

> ….. …..

> 30/01/2018, 18:41 – dominiclimkg: _If you can’t pay then just move out!_

> ….. …..

> 30/01/2018, 18:43 – dominiclimkg: LISTEN AND LISTEN HARD!

> 30/01/2018, 18:43 – dominiclimkg: I WILL LOCK UP THIS UNIT FROM TOM ONWARDS ! LISTEN AND LISTEN HARD!

> (Uppercase in original. Italics added.)

95     The defendant’s reaction was that of one who had been disappointed time and again, and so, was no longer taking kindly to another such occasion of being let down. This could only be because the understanding reached on 26 January 2018 was for payment to be made immediately, in order that the plaintiff be allowed to stay on in the Unit until 25 February 2018. On 4 February 2018 morning, the defendant also told the plaintiff in the most unequivocal of terms:[^137]

##### (3)   The plaintiff made no reference to, and did not rely on the alleged term of Agreement

96     After the 26 January Meeting, the defendant continued to be tenacious in his pursuit of the outstanding rent. However, despite the unpleasant WhatsApp exchanges between the parties on the rent issue, the plaintiff never once defended her position by referring to the alleged agreement made on the 26 January Meeting – that she only needed to try her best to meet the shortfall in rent, and that she was allowed to stay at the Unit until 25 February 2018 regardless of whether she paid the outstanding rent. This was what the plaintiff claimed to have been agreed between the parties.[^138] Even when the WhatsApp messages got heated with both sides calling names, issuing threats, dares, challenges, ultimatums, or just being plain rude, the plaintiff did not insist on her version of the terms of the 26 January 2018 agreement which she is now urging the Court to accept.

97     It was in fact the defendant who made references to 25 February 2018, in the context of evicting the plaintiff before 25 February 2018 if there was no payment. On 4 February 2018 alone, when the parties started their exchanges from 12.05am, the defendant had made at least 6 references to 25 February 2018 before the plaintiff responded that she would move out on 25 February 2018[^139]. There was still no insisting of her right to stay under the alleged agreement of 26 January Meeting.

98     For all the reasons above, it is my finding that the ‘immediate’ payment of the outstanding rent was inextricably tied to and was a condition of the arrangement for the plaintiff to remain in the Unit until 25 February 2018. Consequential to the plaintiff not fulfilling her obligation under this arrangement, the defendant had a right to enter and take possession of the Unit because the plaintiff, by her non-payment, had committed a breach of what the parties had agreed at the 26 January Meeting.

#### The right to forfeit the lease – clause 4(a) of the Tenancy Agreement

99     The relevant portions of clause 4(a) and (b) of the Tenancy Agreement provides:[^140]

> (a)    If the rent hereby reserved shall not be paid for seven (7) days after its due date or if there shall be a breach of any of the conditions, covenants or stipulations on the part of the Tenant herein contained, the Landlord shall be entitled to re-enter upon the said premises and thereupon this tenancy shall immediately absolutely determine…

> (b)    In the event the rent remaining unpaid seven (7) days after becoming payable (whether formally demanded or not), it shall be lawful for the Landlord to claim interest at ten percent (10%) per annum on the amount unpaid calculated from after the date due to the date of actual payment.

100    I would also make a point at this juncture about the plaintiff’s retort over Whatsapp to the defendant that any shortfall in her rent payments could be made good by the Security Deposit of S$5,000 which was held by the defendant. By clause 2(b) of the Tenancy Agreement, it was ineffective for the plaintiff to suggest that since it is clearly provided that “\[t\]his deposit shall not be utilised as set-off for any rent due and payable during the currency of this Agreement.”[^141] See also: _Abe Isaac (Pte) Ltd v Marieta Montalba Pacudan and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 46</span>.

101    Returning to the issue: whilst the plaintiff might have breached the terms of the arrangement made on 26 January 2018 and so, allowed the defendant to invoke the right to re-enter the Unit, the parties dispute on the execution of this right. The plaintiff argues that the common law requirement of forfeiture for non-payment of rent applies. The defendant argues that by interpretation of sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause 4 of the Tenancy Agreement, the formal common law requirement of re-entry for non-payment of rent is dispensed with. Besides, as the plaintiff had breached the clause against subletting in the Tenancy Agreement, the defendant was exercising his right to re-enter on that basis.

##### (1)   The right to forfeit for non-payment of rent

102    The common law requirement for lease forfeiture for non-payment of rent is that there must have first have been a formal demand of payment. See: _Protax Co-operative Society Ltd v Toh Teng Seng & Another_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 84</span> at \[41\] (“**_Protax v Toh_**”); _Alwee Alkaff v Syed Jafaralsadeg & Ors and another action_ \[1998\] 1 SLR 756 at \[25\]. According to _Hill & Redman’s Law of Landlord and Tenant_, Issue 107 (at A\[4630\]-\[4640\]), this formal demand must fulfil the following conditions:

> (a)     that it be “made upon the land, and if there is a house thereupon, at the front door”;

> (b)     that if it was occupied, to be made to the tenant and if the tenant is absent, to the occupier;

> (c)     that it be “for no more than the sum due for rent for the last period for payment”; and

> (d)     that it “be made before sunset on the last day of payment, and be sustained until after sunset”. Payment of rent “at any time on the last day for payment avoids the forfeiture”.

103    It is trite that the requirement of a formal demand can be side-stepped if there are suitable words such as “whether formally demanded or not” in the proviso.[^142] See: _Landlord & Tenant_, Butterworths, 1990; and _Land Law_, LexisNexis, 2017.

104    In the parties’ Tenancy Agreement, it is clear that the words, “whether formally demanded or not” appear in clause 4(b) which concerns imposing interest at 10% per annum on unpaid rents. No such words are in clause 4(a) which provides for the entitlement to re-enter.

105    The defendant has urged this Court to read “whether formally demanded or not” into the context of clause 4(a) of the document since it is superfluous in clause 4(b), given that there is no such formal requirement to make a formal demand for interest for rent which is late. The defendant cited the case of _Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design & Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 1029</span> (“**_Zurich Insurance v B-Gold_**”) for this proposition.

106    I agree that in interpreting the Tenancy Agreement, by the case of _Zurich Insurance v B-Gold_, I should consider its context. However, I am reluctant to export words from a context, even if they are superfluous there, to another context where these words are usually found, but for some reason, are not in the Tenancy Agreement before us. Precisely because they are usually found in the latter context, the fact that they are not, could arguably have been deliberate.

107    Even if the parties did not address their minds to this particular requirement at the time when they signed the Tenancy Agreement, at least at that point of time, they were _ad idem_ on what was drafted. They therefore did intend for the words “(whether formally demanded or not)” to be for purposes of late rent (clause 4(b)). After all, there was no harm to overstate this. Further, the likelihood of late rent (clause 4(b)) is higher than non-payment of rent (clause 4(a)) so, make provision for it for late rent. If they had wanted it also for clause 4(a), their reading it at clause 4(b) should have triggered them to also include it into clause 4(a).

108    There is no reason and no evidence in the present case to persuade the Court that the parties did intend to include “(whether formally demanded or not)” in sub-clause (b) to also apply to sub-clause (a). Further, I am wary that any addition of words to clause 4(a) of the Tenancy Agreement should only clarify what was agreed between the parties and not to introduce a contradiction: _Zurich Insurance v B-Gold_ at \[132(f)\]. That the words “(whether formally demanded or not)” are absent in clause 4(a) of the Tenancy Agreement, I therefore agree with plaintiff’s counsel that the formal demand for re-entry or forfeiture for non-payment of rent was not dispensed with. The defendant should therefore have issued the plaintiff a formal demand.

109    However, it was also the defendant’s case that he had re-entered the Unit or forfeited the lease on account of the plaintiff’s unauthorised subletting.

##### (2)   The right to forfeit for unauthorised subletting

110    The defendant had issued the plaintiff the 29 December Repossession Notice. In this Notice, he had referred to the plaintiff’s unauthorised subletting. The defendant argued that because of the plaintiff’s unauthorised subletting, he was entitled to re-enter the Unit, again by virtue of clause 4(a) of the Tenancy Agreement. As this breach is not for non-payment of salary, the common law requirement of a formal demand does not apply.

111    It is expressly provided in the Tenancy Agreement, that subletting is prohibited. The relevant excerpt of clause 2 of the Tenancy Agreement reads:

> The Tenant hereby agrees with the Landlord as follows:

>> (t)    Not to… sublet… the said premises or any part thereof without the written consent of the Landlord which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld…

112    The plaintiff counters the defendant’s arguments by arguing that, by the 26 January 2018 meeting, because the defendant had allowed the plaintiff to continue her tenancy despite knowing about the unauthorised subletting, he could not now cry breach. The defendant had elected to waive his right.

113    The case of _Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian Hiap Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 4</span> (“**_Audi Construction v Kian Hiap_**”) is instructive on the law on waiver by election. The Court of Appeal in that case sets out the general principles (at \[54\]):

> This doctrine concerns a situation where a party has a choice between two inconsistent rights. If he elects not to exercise one of those rights, he will be held to have abandoned that right if he has communicated his election in clear and unequivocal terms to the other party. He must also be aware of the facts which have given rise to the existence of the right he is said to have elected not to exercise. Once the election is made, it is final and binding, and the party is treated as having waived that right by his election… .

114    Applying the principle of waiver in _Audi Construction v Kian Hiap_ to the present case, it is my holding that the defendant has _not_ waived his right for re-entry or forfeiture of the tenancy. My reasoning follows.

115    If the defendant had elected to abandon his right to forfeit the tenancy on account of the plaintiff’s unauthorised subletting, this must have been communicated “in clear and unequivocal terms” to the plaintiff. This means that the defendant’s conduct must be capable of one construction only – that the defendant had elected to forgo that right. See: _Wilken & Ghaly: The Law of Waiver, Variation and Estoppel_ (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2012).

116    It is pertinent that in the defendant’s 29 December Repossession Notice[^143] to the plaintiff, he had referred to the plaintiff’s “failure to pay rents in full” and “\[i\]n addition”, to her “rent\[ing\] out the \[Unit\] to a third party, which is in clear violation of clause 2(t) of the Agreement.” The Notice continues:

> **In view of these breaches of the Agreement and by this notice, you are hereby given advance notice to evict from \[the Unit\]. You shall handover** \[sic\] **the \[Unit\] latest by 1 January 2018…** **_or on a later date as agreeable by the Landlord_****, subject to the Landlord’s consent in his sole discretion** (emphasis in bold in original; emphasis in italics added.)

That the defendant had relied on both the breaches of the non-payment of rent and the unauthorised subletting as reasons for his re-entry was affirmed when he was cross-examined. He told plaintiff’s counsel that the bases of his exercising his right to re-enter were “her (the plaintiff’s) non-payment of the rentals, and also at that point in time there’s also the – this subletting of the premises without my permission.”[^144]

117    The Whatsapp communications from 29 December 2017 showed that the parties consistently communicated over the issue of the plaintiff’s subletting, as well as tried to make appointment to discuss the same. Poring over pages and pages of the transcript of their Whatsapp messages from 29 December 2017 all the way to their meeting on 26 January 2018,[^145] if there was one position that the defendant was communicating to the plaintiff and in clear and unequivocal terms, it was that he was disapproving of the subtenancy. He made sure to impress upon the plaintiff that she had breached the terms of the Tenancy Agreement.

118    The 29 December Repossession Notice clearly stated that the plaintiff was to move out on 1 January 2018 “or on a later date agreeable by the \[defendant\]”. Hence, the meeting on 26 January 2018. It was the defendant’s case that the plaintiff could move out on 25 February 2018, provided that she satisfied payment for the outstanding rent. However, when the condition of the payment was not fulfilled, the intention conveyed by the 29 December Repossession Notice must resume effect: the right to forfeit was expressly reserved in the 29 December Repossession Notice.

119    The plaintiff had suggested that by the defendant’s inaction on 1 January 2018 to evict the plaintiff, “he is deemed to have waived a legal right by his conduct. This is irrespective of whether that party (that is, the defendant) subjectively believes that he had waived his right or gives testimony to this effect.”[^146] In _Protax v Toh_, the High Court opined (at \[24\]), “It would appear that waiver is entirely a matter of law and not of the parties’ intention.” So, if a landlord serves a notice to quit on the tenant for the latter’s unauthorised subletting, but accepts a payment of rent which has become due after the forfeiture occurred, the law steps in to imply a waiver on the landlord’s part. It then renders irrelevant whether the landlord had intended to waive the right of re-entry. See: _Hong Cheok Lam v Ong Sing Mai and 4 others_ \[1951\] 17 MLJ 34, cited by plaintiff’s counsel in _Protax v Toh_.

120    A waiver, however, has to be unequivocal, even if it is implied by conduct. See again: _Audi Construction v Kian Hiap_. An inaction is capable of being misunderstood, just as in the present case, when the defendant was still trying to work out with the plaintiff the date for moving out (and not trying to work out what the plaintiff could do to retain the tenancy). Perhaps that is why the High Court in _Protax v Toh_ also makes it clear that “\[a\] landlord does not waive the forfeiture by merely standing by and seeing it incurred… ; there must be some positive act of waiver.”

121    Reviewing the evidence before me, I noted that at no time did the defendant waver or vacillate in his position that he wanted the subtenancy terminated. As long as the subtenancy was continuing, the plaintiff remained in breach of the Tenancy Agreement between them. Whilst the defendant might have stalled his exercise of re-entry, he had not waived it. I must admit that under these circumstances, I had found it preposterous that on 8 February 2018, the plaintiff could have the nerve to ask the defendant to open the Unit’s door to allow her housing agent and a potential subtenant to view the Unit.

122    It flows from the above that, whilst the defendant had failed to meet the requisite notice for re-entry for the non-payment of rent, he nevertheless re-entered lawfully on account of the plaintiff’s breach of the Tenancy Agreement when she sublet the Unit without the defendant’s written consent as required under clause 2(t) of the Tenancy Agreement. I have found no evidence that he had waived his right to re-enter.

123    As I would have arrived at the above finding, I did not consider it relevant to discuss defendant’s counsel’s submissions based on _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67. The background was this: according to the defendant, the plaintiff’s case was that the defendant did not rely on the breach of the unauthorised subletting to re-enter the Unit. No evidence was therefore led by plaintiff’s counsel on this. defendant’s counsel therefore urged that the plaintiff should therefore be precluded, by the case of _Browne v Dunn_ from raising arguments on this. Of course the plaintiff had disputed this. My holding is that even if this Court were to allow for the plaintiff’s argument in this area, it would still be defeated.

## Summary of decision for the claim

124    In summary, it is my holding that the plaintiff has not discharged her burden of proof on a balance of probabilities that her allegedly missing items were even in the Unit when the defendant re-entered the Unit. These missing items are the Tiffany diamond bracelet, the Leica camera, the Apple TV and the red Ferragamo shoes. For the Apple TV and the Leica camera, the plaintiff did not even have evidence that they were ever in her possession since there was no photographic evidence that they were so. The photograph of the Apple TV that the plaintiff exhibited was admittedly not even her Apple TV.

125    Given that the plaintiff has not shown that the items were even in the Unit at the time of the defendant’s re-entry into the same, the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendant’s actions of removing her items caused the said items to go missing was a stab in the dark.

126    Although the plaintiff had pleaded that the defendant was negligent in failing to ensure that her belongings were not damaged or did not go missing, there was no evidence before me that any of her items were damaged. If her items were missing and she had suffered loss or damage thereby, she had not adduced evidence that the plaintiff was the cause.

127    The plaintiff also argued that the defendant had unlawfully entered the Unit while she still had occupation of it. This related back to the 26 January Meeting. The plaintiff had understood from the meeting that she could continue to occupy the Unit until 25 February 2018. She only needed to ‘try her best’ to pay the oustanding rent. On the defendant’s part, it was a condition for her continuing to reside there until 25 February 2018 that she satisfies payment of her outstanding rent. From the circumstances of the case and the parties’ actions and behaviour, the Court had found that what was agreed at the 26 January Meeting was the defendant’s version, rather than the plaintiff’s.

128    Since the plaintiff had continued to allow the rent to be outstanding, by clause 4(a) of the Tenancy Agreement, the defendant was entitled to exercise his right to re-enter and forfeit the lease.

129    It was admitted by the defendant that his re-entry was premised upon the two breaches of the plaintiff: (a) her non-payment of rent; and (b) her subletting of the Unit, against the express prohibition of subletting in the Tenancy Agreement unless there was written consent from the landlord.

130    However, it was my finding that the defendant had not fulfilled the common law requirement for re-entry for non-payment of rent. He would therefore have re-entered the Unit unlawfully but for his re-entry based on the plaintiff’s breach of clause 2(t) of the Tenancy Agreement when she sublet the Unit without the defendant’s written consent. Under the latter circumstance, and invoking clause 4(a) of the Tenancy Agreement, the defendant’s re-entry into the Unit was lawful. There are therefore no damages due to the plaintiff for any unlawful entry into the Unit to forfeit the lease and to remove her belongings.

## The counterclaim

131    We now deal with the defendant’s counterclaim for, _inter alia_, rent and interest payable under the Tenancy Agreement. The defendant’s prayers for his counterclaim in his pleadings are as follows:[^147]

> (1)    The sum of S$8,193.55 as referred to in paragraph 46 ~44~ above;

> (2)    Interest in the sum of S$428.47 pursuant to Clause 4(b) of the Tenancy Agreement;

> (3)    A declaration that the defendant is entitled to set-off the following costs against the Security Deposit:

>> (a)    Costs incurred… in moving the plaintiff’s personal belongings from the Unit to the Warehouse on 10 February 2018 and from the Warehouse back to the Unit on 8 April 2018, including the costs incurred in storing the plaintiff’s personal belongings at the Warehouse from 10 February 2018 to 8 April 2018; and

>> (b)    Costs incurred by the defendant in reinstating the Unit as a result of the plaintiff’s failure to keep the Unit in good and tenantable repair and condition.

> (4)    Costs on an indemnity basis pursuant to Clause 4(c) of the Tenancy Agreement; and

> (5)    Such other orders or further relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.

132    plaintiff’s counsel raised a point about the defendant’s changing amounts of claim for the outstanding rent since the beginning of the trial, and so, the unclear amount for the claim for interest. The Court was also urged to reject the claim for a declaration for the defendant’s transport and warehousing expenses. The argument is that these expenses were incurred on the defendant’s own accord and in violation of the plaintiff’s rights.[^148]

### Transport and warehousing expenses

133    Having found that the defendant had entered the Unit lawfully, by the case of _Protax v Toh_ the defendant may take steps to remove the plaintiff’s personal belongings from the Unit, especially since ample notice had earlier been given to the plaintiff. The Court in _Protax v Toh_ stated (at \[125\]):

> If the tenants or subtenants refused to take steps to remove their belongings after reasonable notice and opportunity had been given to them to do so, it would be too late now to complain that there was loss of or trespass to their goods by the landlord upon lawful re-entry and re-possession of the premises. Thereafter, the landlord or his agents would be entitled to remove these goods or discard them. The landlord cannot then be accused of committing trespass to the goods left behind in the premises.

134    Apart from the incessant exchanges of Whatsapp messages between the parties[^149] where the defendant had, on so many occasions forewarned the plaintiff, there were also the formal 28 August Demand Notice, and the two Notices of Repossession of 2 October 2017 and 29 December 2017. Reasonable notices and opportunities had indeed been given to the plaintiff to remove her personal belongings. The plaintiff cannot therefore claim that she did not see this coming. As a result of the plaintiff’s ignoring all of these, the defendant was driven to take the action which he did in the end. The plaintiff must therefore bear the expenses the defendant was put through to incur. No issue was raised on the quantum of S$900 for this claim.

135    On the costs incurred by the defendant to reinstate the Unit to its good and tenantable repair and condition, the parties have agreed on the amount of S$500.

### Outstanding rent and interest

136    In Annex A of their Closing Submissions,[^150] defendant’s counsel have set out in a table form the incidences of rent payments with its dates. They have also worked out the amounts of interest at 10% per annum which is allowable by virtue of clause 4(b) of the Tenancy Agreement. The plaintiff has not raised any dispute on the information. I have also reviewed and saw no issue with it.

137    In his Closing Submissions, the defendant has submitted that the outstanding rent owing by the plaintiff up to 4 February 2018 is S$2,145.16. The amount of interest accumulated from the many occasions of late payments is S$765.28. It is also clear from the table how these amounts were arrived.

138    I would have awarded these amounts to the defendant on their counterclaim if not for their pleadings.

### Issue with the defendant’s pleadings

139    It can be observed that the defendant had not included the usual words “or such sum as the Court deems fit” or words of similar effect at the ends of prayers (1) and (2). By the case of _Edmund Tie & Company (SEA) Pte Ltd_ v _Savills Residential Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 84</span> (“**_Edmund Tie v Savills_**”), unless this Court awards the defendant in his counterclaim at the amount of S$8,193.55 for rent due and payable, or the amount of S$428.47 for interest (“**the Pleaded Sums**”), this Court must dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim.

140    From my review of the table drawn up by the defendant, the correct amount of rent to be awarded to the defendant on his counterclaim would be S$2,145.16, and S$765.28 for interest. However, as the defendant has pleaded very specifically the Pleaded Sums and “no more, no less”, it would be “the correct order \[to\] not grant\[ \] something the \[defendant\] did not ask for”: _Edmund Tie v Savills_, at \[14\]. This Court must therefore dismiss his counterclaim.

141    Whilst I accept that in his Closing Submissions, the defendant had shifted his position from the Pleaded Sums to claiming the sums that this Court would have ordered. However, the defendant must stand or fall by his pleading. Perhaps that was why Choo Han Teck J also mentioned in _Edmund Tie v Savills_ (at \[10\]) that –

> Even at the close of the submissions, before judgment, the applicant could have asked the court for leave to amend its statement of claim by inserting the crucial eight words. The trial judge might not have granted an application to amend… but all that Mr Tan \[applicant’s counsel\] needed to do was to ask.

For the record, there was no such application for leave to amend the counterclaim before me.

142    In _Edmund Tie v Savills_, and so it is in the present case, it is small or no comfort that there is the ancillary prayer for “\[s\]uch other orders or further relief as this Honourable Court deems fit”. As Choo J ruled, “that was pleaded as a separate relief and such prayers are intended to enable the court to make such orders that may facilitate the execution of the main orders. The main orders, in the present case, are the order regarding the rent and the interest for delayed rent payments.

## Summary of decision for the counterclaim

143    It flows from the above that the defendant’s counterclaim for rent and interest must be dismissed. However, I would allow the setting off against the S$5,000 Security Deposit the transport and warehousing expenses of S$900, and the S$500 agreed between the parties for reinstating the Unit to its good and tenantable repair and condition.

## Conclusion / Order

144    This is my order for the claim:[^151]

> (a)     That the plaintiff’s claim for a declaration that the defendant was in breach of the Tenancy Agreement or any agreement with the plaintiff when he re-entered the Unit on or before 4 February 2018[^152] and removed the plaintiff’s personal belongings be dismissed;

> (b)     That the plaintiff’s claim for a declaration that the defendant was negligent in failing to ensure that the plaintiff’s belongings were not damaged and did not go missing during the period in which they were in his sole custody be dismissed;

> (c)     That the defendant return to the plaintiff the balance of the S$5,000 Security Deposit after setting off the sums allowed to be deducted therefrom under the counterclaim; and

> (d)     That the plaintiff’s claim for damages to be assessed for the defendant’s unlawful re-entry and/or trespass of the Unit and of the plaintiff’s personal belongings on or before 8 February 2018 and/or negligence in failing to ensure that the plaintiff’s belongings were not damaged and did not go missing be dismissed.

145    This is my order for the counterclaim:[^153]

> (a)     That the defendant’s claim for the sum of S$8,193.55 as referred to in paragraph 46 of the defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) Defence (Amendment No. 1) be dismissed;

> (b)     That the defendant’s claim for interest in the sum of S$428.47 pursuant to clause 4(b) of the Tenancy Agreement be dismissed;

> (c)     That the defendant’s claim for a declaration that the defendant is entitled to set off the following costs against the Security Deposit be allowed and to the extent of the amount ordered:

>> (i)       costs incurred by the defendant in moving the plaintiff’s personal belongings from the Unit to the Warehouse on 10 February 2018 and from the Warehouse back to the Unit on 8 April 2018, including the costs incurred in storing the plaintiff’s personal belongings at the Warehouse from 10 February 2018 to 8 April 2018, at S$900; and

>> (ii)       costs incurred by the defendant in reinstating the Unit as a result of the plaintiff’s failure to keep the Unit in good and tenantable repair and condition, agreed by the Parties at S$500.

146    Taking into account both the claim and the counterclaim, the defendant is to refund the amount of S$3,600 to the plaintiff, being the balance of the Security Deposit after setting-off the sums allowed to be deducted therefrom under the counterclaim.

147    I further order that the parties bear their own costs.
