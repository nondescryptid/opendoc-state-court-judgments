### District Judge Samuel Hwa Kuan Chua:

## The Charges

1       Shafie Bin Osman (“the Accused”), a 38-year-old male Malay Singaporean (Date of Birth 10 December 1980), faced nine similar charges under section 420 r/w section 109 Penal Code for engaging in a conspiracy with his accomplices to cheat elderly Malay victims of large sums of money between 21 April 2015 and 19 May 2015.

2       The Prosecution proceeded on six charges. The Accused admitted to the remaining three charges and consented for them to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

6       The Prosecution highlighted the sentences that were imposed on two of the Accused’s accomplices who had pleaded guilty, namely Annie Sahlawaty Binte Mohd Salleh (“Annie”) and Nur Khairunnisa Binte Mohd Ridzwan (“Khairunnisa”), albeit in relation to a different matrix of proceeded charges. The Prosecution also tendered a table of the following sentencing precedents:

> a.      **_PP v Sng Boon Chye_** (DAC 916941-2014 & ors) (Pleaded guilty);

> b.      **_PP v Goh Chye Meng_** (DAC 12976-2012 & ors) (Pleaded guilty);

> c.      **_PP v Terry Toh Kwang Huat_** (DAC 16281-2012 & ors) (Pleaded guilty);

> d.      **_PP v Goh Keng Huang_** (DAC 800683-2013 & ors) (Pleaded guilty); and

> e.      **_PP v Stefanovic Nenad_** <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 61</span> (Pleaded guilty).

## Mitigation

7       The Accused was unrepresented by defence counsel for the Plead Guilty hearing before me.

8       He tendered the following handwritten mitigation plea:

> “Your Honour, I am standing before you to plead guilty to all of the charges which have been brought upon me. As the final sentencing would be meted out by you, I have decided to state my mitigating factors and hopefully you would kindly show me much clemency and sentence me to a lower term. Honestly speaking, when I sit in my cell and reflect upon my actions, I feel an overwhelming sense of regret and remorse. Reality is hitting me harder than I expected, especially now when I realise the depth of my actions. I am going to channel all my efforts hence forth, in rehabilitating myself and embrace all the rehab programmes the prison and government offer me to mend my ways and live an upright life beyond the walls of the prison. Whatever I have done, it was all utter foolishness and folliness on my part and its impact has extended to my family. I sincerely apologise to have left a dent. All I seek now is your leniency and I plead to you to mete out a sentence which would allow me to go out sooner. The final decision falls on you and I hope you would pass out the minimum sentence within the confines of the benchmark. I also hope that your Honour would consider and backdate my sentence during my remanded period of 6 months in 2016 and 3 months in 2019. Last but not least, I hereby would like to say that I am truly remorseful and regretful to what had happened. Thank you for hearing me out and your leniency. God Bless and Good Day Your Honour.” (_sic._)

9       While there was no dispute that the Accused had been remanded since 18 July 2019, the Accused’s claim that he had been remanded for six months in 2016 was not supported by the court records. The Accused was also not able to substantiate his claim about the duration of his alleged first remand.

10     The Accused was first charged in Court 26 on 7 December 2016. Bail was offered in the sum of $40,000, with $30,000 to be furnished with monetary security and $10,000 with non-monetary security. During the Mention in Court 26 on 21 December 2019, bail was reduced to $30,000, with $20,000 to be furnished with monetary security and $10,000 with non-monetary security. During the Bail Review Mention in Court 26 on 27 December 2016, bail was further reduced to $20,000, with $5,000 to be furnished with monetary security and $15,000 with non-monetary security. The Accused was bailed out on 16 January 2017. The Accused was therefore in remand from 7 December 2016 to 15 January 2017, a period of one month and eight days. On 19 March 2018, the Accused did not appear on the first day of his trial, and a Warrant of Arrest was issued against him. On 20 March 2018, the Accused appeared for the second day of his trial. Bail was increased by $10,000, with $5,000 to be furnished with monetary security and $5,000 with non-monetary security. On 22 March 2018, bail was varied for the additional $10,000 to be furnished with non-monetary security. The additional bail was furnished on the same day. On 18 July 2019, bail was revoked as the Accused had allegedly re-offended while on bail.

## The Court’s Decision

11     The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 420 r/w section 109 Penal Code is up to 10 years’ imprisonment and a discretionary fine.

12     Upon considering the facts of the case, the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I sentenced the Accused to a total of 48 months’ imprisonment, which I backdated to 18 July 2019.

13     The predominant sentencing considerations in this case were general and specific deterrence.

## Offence-specific factors

14     The following offence-specific aggravating factors were present in this case:

> a.      **The offences were syndicated, premeditated and carefully planned.** The Accused and each of his three accomplices (namely, Annie, Khairunnisa and Noorfauziah Binte Yusof (“Noorfauziah”)) played different roles in the operations to deceive the victims. As summarised in the table below, the Accused had played an active and significant role in each operation. Further, the Accused and his accomplices had taken steps to avoid detection by using mobile phone lines which were not registered in their names and were not traceable to them to communicate with the victims.[^1]

> b.      **The Accused and his accomplices had targeted vulnerable victims.** The Accused and his accomplices had targeted elderly victims who earned a low monthly salary, had lost a significant amount of their savings in failed investments and were desperate to recoup their losses. The loss that had been caused to the victims would have represented a large proportion of their savings. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that they were a vulnerable class of victims.[^2]

> c.      **The Accused was in a position of trust vis-à-vis the victims and he had breached that trust.** In his capacity as an employee of Desa Amanah Ltd through which company the victims had made their failed investments, the Accused had access to information about the victims’ financial status and investments, and was able to equip his accomplices with information which helped them to contact the victims and deceive them. Having previously dealt with the victims, the Accused was able to tell his accomplices how much each victim could pay and whether that victim was easy to deceive. Since the Accused had previously dealt with the victims vis-à-vis their failed investments and had facilitated their futile visit to a lawyer to recover their investment money, the victims believed the Accused’s representations to them and trusted the persons whom the Accused had introduced to them as persons who were able to assist them to recover their invested moneys.

> d.      **The deception involved forging documents purportedly issued by public institutions and impersonating officers from the Singapore judiciary.** The Accused and his accomplices had presented to the victims forged documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. They had also impersonated officers who worked in the “Court” and the “Small Claims Tribunals”. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused and his accomplices had done so to create the illusion of governmental authority in their interaction with the victims and to cloak their misrepresentations with a veneer of credibility. In my view, these had the effect of undermining public trust and confidence in public institutions such as the Supreme Court of Singapore and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, as well as trust in officers who work within the Singapore judiciary.[^3]

> e.      **The frequency and scale of the offending was significant.** The Accused and his accomplices had committed the nine offences within a span of less than a month, namely, 21 April 2015 to 19 May 2015. In respect of the nine charges, the Accused and his accomplices had cheated a total of 10 victims of substantial amounts of money, namely, $268,398.[^4] The Accused and his accomplices had not made any restitution to the victims.[^5]

> f.      **The Accused was motivated purely by greed and self-interest.** He had received about 20% to 30% of each sum of money that was cheated from the victims. This translated into $53,679.60 to $80,519.40 (for all nine charges) and $48,239.60 to $72,359.40 (for the six proceeded charges).[^6]

## Prosecution’s sentencing precedents and determining the indicative starting sentences

15     Annie faced 213 charges and had re-offended while on bail. She was also traced for property-related offences. She was sentenced to six years and six months’ Corrective Training.

16     Khairunnisa faced five similar charges under section 420 r/w section 109 Penal Code. She pleaded guilty to three charges and consented for two charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Of Khairunnisa’s three proceeded charges, two charges mirrored the proceeded charges against the Accused. The sentences of the two mirrored charges were ordered to run consecutively, making a total of 24 months’ imprisonment.

17     Unlike Khairunnisa who faced five charges involving a total amount of $144,798, the Accused faced nine charges involving a total amount of $268,398. While the Prosecution had proceeded on three charges against Khairunnisa involving a total amount of $137,798, the Prosecution had proceeded on six charges against the Accused involving a total amount of $241,198. Khairunnisa pleaded guilty after eight days of trial and after all five victims in relation to her charges had given evidence during the trial. In contrast, the Accused pleaded guilty after 20 days of trial and after all 10 victim in relation to his nine charges had given evidence during the trial. While Khairunnisa’s property related antecedents were of Assisting in concealment or disposal of stolen property in 2006 (for which she was fined $800) and of Theft in 2009 (for which she was fined $700), the Accused’s antecedents were of four counts of Robbery with Hurt and one count of Gang Robbery in 2001 (for which he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane). In my assessment, the Accused’s criminality was significantly greater than Khairunnisa’s.

18     In respect of DAC 945329-2016 against the Accused and the parallel charge of DAC 945346-2016 against Khairunnisa, Khairunnisa telephoned the victim and told the victim that she was also an investor and had managed to recover her investment money. Khairunnisa asked the victim if she wanted to recover her investment money and told the victim that her friend, i.e. the Accused, could help the victim to do so. Khairunnisa then gave the victim the Accused’s contact number. There was no face-to-face interaction between Khairunnisa and the victim. In contrast, the Accused’s role in the operation was significantly more substantial than Khairunnisa’s. The Accused told the victim over the telephone that he was a former staff of ANI, that he had met her previously and that he could bring her to meet his friend who could help her to recover her investment money. He met the victim and brought the victim to meet Noorfauziah. After the victim had agreed to hand the money to Noorfauziah, the Accused brought the victim and her brother to a bank and Automated Teller Machines at Plaza Singapura, Takashimaya Shopping Centre and Chinatown to withdraw money, which the victim subsequently handed to Noorfauziah. In addition, the Accused had, together with Noorfauziah, provided his accomplices with information on the victim’s contact details, investment and financial ability, and an assessment of the victim’s financial sophistication, without which the operation to deceive the victim could not have commenced. In my assessment, the Accused’s culpability in respect of this charge was higher than Khairunnisa’s, which justified an uplift from the six months’ imprisonment term that had been imposed on Khairunnisa for that charge.

19     In respect of DAC 945331-2016 against the Accused and the parallel charge of DAC 945347-2016 against Khairunnisa, Khairunnisa impersonated as Annie’s assistant, met up with the victim and brought the victim in a car to the location where Annie was waiting for them. Upon arrival, Khairunnisa introduced Annie to the victim as her boss. Khairunnisa sat behind Annie while Annie spoke to the victim and showed the victim a forged document purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore. Although the Accused had no telephone or face-to-face communication with the victim, he had, together with Noorfauziah, provided his accomplices with information on the victim’s contact details, investment and financial ability, and an assessment of the victim’s financial sophistication, without which the operation to deceive the victim could not have commenced. In line with his role in the operation, he had remained in the vicinity of where Khairunnisa and Annie had met the victim in order to split the money that had been cheated from the victim. In my assessment, the Accused’s culpability in respect of this charge was still greater than Khairunnisa’s.

20     In respect of the Accused’s four other proceeded charges (namely, DAC 945332-2016, DAC 945326-2016, DAC 945328-2016 and DAC 945330-2016), the roles that he had played in each of the four operations to deceive the four victims were more active and more significant than the roles that he had played in DAC 945329-2016 and DAC 945331-2016. Consequently, the sentences that were imposed on him for these four charges had to reflect his greater culpability.

21     In **_PP v Sng Boon Chye_**, the accused, who was untraced, pleaded guilty to 38 charges under section 420 Penal Code and one charge under section 406 Penal Code, with 146 charges under section 420 Penal Code taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused asked various victims to sign up for mobile devices contracts and to pass the accused the mobile devices obtained under the said contract, in exchange for cash for the mobile device. The accused also represented that he would pay for the subscription and termination fees of the said contract. The victims were further promised commissions based on the number of mobile devices delivered to the accused. In fact, the accused was aware at all material times that he was unable to pay for the relevant fees and did not intend to pay for such fees. The accused then sold the mobile devices obtained at a second-hand shop for profit and used the sales proceeds for his personal expenses. Between March 2010 and April 2013, the accused deceived a total of 95 victims and dishonestly induced these victims to deliver to him a total of $299,599 worth of mobile devices. The mobile devices were not recovered and no restitution was made. For each of the section 420 Penal Code charges, the accused was sentenced to four to 12 months’ imprisonment, with a total sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment.

22     In **_PP v Goh Chye Meng_**, the accused, who was traced for Criminal Breach of Trust, pleaded guilty to five charges under section 420 Penal Code, with four similar charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused was a freelance salesman selling perfume. He put in false purchase orders from a customer to the company. He deceived the company into believing that a customer had ordered the perfume and induced delivery to himself. He then sold the perfume and gambled away the monies. The five proceeded charges involved $18,729, $11,400, $77,154, $39,496 and $35,113, totalling $181,892. The remaining four charges involved a further $38,400. The total value of the goods in respect of all nine charges was $220,292. For the charges involving $18,729, $11,400, $77,154, $39,496 and $35,113, the accused was sentenced to imprisonment terms of five months, four months, 17 months, 8 months and 8 months respectively. The total sentence was 30 months’ imprisonment.

23     In **_PP v Terry Toh Kwang Huat_**, the accused pleaded guilty to five charges under section 420 Penal Code, with six similar charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. For three charges, the accused cheated his friend by stating that he needed cash to purchase a car, which he would sell for a profit. The accused induced his friend to hand over various sums of $18,000, $20,000 and $35,000 to him. For two charges, the accused cheated his girlfriend into delivering $16,000 and $12,000 on the pretext of an investment opportunity. In total, the charges involved $162,500. The accused made partial restitution of $20,500 to his friend and $10,000 to his girlfriend. The accused was traced for Cheating, Criminal Breach of Trust, Theft as a Servant and Fraudulent Possession. In respect of the charges involving $18,000, $20,000, $16,000 and $12,000, the accused was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment per charge. In respect of the charge involving $35,000, the accused was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. The total sentence was five years’ imprisonment.

24     In **_PP v Goh Keng Huang_**, the accused, who was untraced, pleaded guilty to two charges under section 420 Penal Code and two charges under section 408 Penal Code, with five charges under section 420 Penal Code and one charge under section 408 Penal Code taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused was a consultant with a company. He deceived various potential franchisees to pay fees and other payments to obtain a franchise, which he had no intention to help the franchisees obtain. In respect of the ten charges committed over a period of seven months, four victims paid the accused a total of $547,295 in cash and gold, which the accused kept for himself. The two proceeded cheating charges involved sums of $180,000 and $32,657. Partial restitution of $56,000 was made to one of the victims. For the section 420 Penal Code charges involving $180,000 and $32,657, the accused was sentenced to imprisonment terms of 30 months and eight months respectively. For the section 408 Penal Code charges involving $50,000 and $81,000, the accused was sentenced to imprisonment terms of 10 months and 16 months respectively. The total sentence was 54 months’ imprisonment.

25     In **_PP v Stefanovic Nenad_**, the accused, who was untraced, pleaded guilty to four charges under section 420 Penal Code, with four charges under section 420 Penal Code, two charges under section 406 Penal Code and one charge under section 465 Penal Code taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused was a derivative trader who had approached various victims to invest their money with him. On eight occasions over two years, he promised his victims a return of 30% for one year. When the victims paid him various sums of money for the purpose of the investment, the accused used the money to cover his personal expenses and repay other victims whom he had cheated. The total sum cheated was $881,070. The total amount in the proceeded charges was $445,560. Out of this sum, $181,100 was recovered from the accused. For the proceeded charges which involved $50,000 to $165,000, the accused was sentenced to imprisonment terms of between 17 months and 30 months. The total sentence was 64 months’ imprisonment.

26     There was nothing in the Prosecution’s submission to suggest that the five cases mentioned above had involved the use of forged documents purportedly issued by government agencies or the impersonation of public officials in carrying out the deception of the victims, as in the present case. The individual and global sentences imposed on the Accused in the present case must necessarily reflect this significant aggravating factor.

27     As compared to the other three cases, the culpability of the Accused in the present case was relatively more similar to **_PP v Goh Chye Meng_** (“_Goh_”) and **_PP v Terry Toh Kwang Huat_** (“_Toh_”). The accused persons in the present case, _Goh_ and _Toh_ were traced for property-related antecedents. They faced a similar total number of charges, namely, nine in the present case, nine in _Goh_ and 11 in _Toh_. The Prosecution proceeded on a similar number of charges pursuant to their guilty plea, namely, six in the present case, five in both _Goh_ and _Toh_. The total value involved in all the charges was broadly similar, namely, $268,398 in the present case, $220,292 in _Goh_ and $162,500 in _Toh_. However, while partial restitution of $30,500 had been made in _Toh_, no restitution had been made in the present case and in _Goh_. While the value involved in the individual proceeded charges ranged from $11,400 to $77,154 in _Goh_, and $12,000 to $35,000 in _Toh_, the value involved in the individual proceeded charges in the present case ranged more broadly from $11,960 to $114,008. Further, while the present case involved a syndicated operation, use of forged documents purportedly issued by government agencies and the impersonation of public officials, there was no such suggestion in _Goh_ and _Toh_.

28     In my assessment, the sentences that were imposed in _Khairunnisa_, _Goh_ and _Toh_ were therefore instructive in determining the indicative starting sentences in the present case, but with the appropriate adjustments made to account for the similar or differentiating factors that I have discussed above.

## Offender-specific factors

29     The following offender-specific factors were present in this case:

> a.     The Accused was convicted of a series of Robbery with Hurt and Gang Robbery offences in 2001. Since it was a relevant albeit dated antecedent, I had placed some weight on it.

> b.     Little, if any, mitigating weight was given to the Accused’s decision to plead guilty, since he had done so at a very late stage of the long-drawn trial and after all ten victims whom he had played a part in cheating had given evidence in court.

> c.     Notwithstanding the Accused’s claim in his mitigation plea that he was remorseful for his offending behaviour, there was no concrete manifestation of his remorse, apart from his belated plea of guilt.

30     Having considered the facts of the present case, the Accused’s relative culpability vis-à-vis his accomplices, and the period that he had been in remand[^7], and keeping in mind the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences[^8], as well as the totality principle[^9], I sentenced the Accused to a total of 48 months’ imprisonment, which I backdated to 18 July 2019.

**Annex**

**PUBLIC PROSECUTOR V SHAFIE BIN OSMAN**

SC-912462-2016

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

**Parties involved**

**1.** The **Accused** is Shafie Bin Osman, a 38-year old male Singaporean, holder of NRIC No. XXX.

**2.** The Accused’s accomplices are:

> a.     Annie Sahlawaty Binte Mohd Salleh (“**Annie**”), a 46-year old female Singaporean, holder of NRIC No. XXX;

> b.     Noorfauziah Binte Yusof (“**Noorfauziah**”), a 40-year old female Singaporean, holder of NRIC No. XXX; and

> c.     Nur Khairunnisa Binte Mohd Ridzwan (“**Khairunnisa**”), a 32-year old female Singaporean, holder of NRIC No. XXX.

**Background facts**

3.     Sometime between April 2015 and August 2015, the Accused and his accomplices engaged in conspiracies and worked in a team to cheat elderly victims, who had previously invested in companies such as Desa Amanah Ltd (“**DAL**”) but failed to receive dividends due to them and/or have their invested moneys returned to them.

4.     Having previously worked in DAL, the Accused and Noorfauziah had access to information about the victims’ previous investments. Consequently, they were able to equip the team with information which helped them to deceive the victims. Having dealt with the victims, they were able to tell the rest of the team how much each victim could pay and whether the victim was easy to deceive. They provided the victims’ contacts and arranged for / brought them to meet the rest of the team, on the pretext that the victims would be able to recover the moneys they had lost through their investments.

5.     The Accused’s physical presence was deliberately orchestrated in order to give assurance to the victims, as he had been involved in the victims’ earlier investments and/or introduced some of them to lawyers to attempt to recover their invested moneys. He therefore had the victims’ trust.

6.     When the Accused’s accomplices met up with the victims, they brazenly pretended to be a lawyer or an officer from the Court, and presented to the victims forged documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and banks. They sought to create the illusion of governmental authority in order to cloak their misrepresentations with a veneer of credibility. The document purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore bore a seal with the Coat of Arms of Singapore and was purportedly issued by one “Lim Hui Ting” (Secretary) (**sample letter at Annex A**), while the document purportedly issued by MAS bore a MAS logo (**sample letter at Annex B**).

7.     In order to conceal their identities and evade apprehension, the team also used mobile phone lines, which were not registered in their own names and not traceable to them, as opposed to their personal lines, to communicate with the victims.

8.     Annie had introduced Noorfauziah into the team, while Khairunnisa was roped in by Noorfauziah. The Accused was introduced to the team by Noorfauziah.

9.     After the team received moneys cheated from the victims, they split the moneys according to the roles each of them played for each victim’s case.

10.    The Accused agreed to participate in the offences because he wanted a share of the moneys cheated from the victims.

11.    The Accused was consequently charged in Court on 7 December 2016 for 9 counts of offence under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

12.    The Accused elected to claim trial to all 9 charges against him, and a joint trial was held for the Accused, Khairunnisa and Noorfauziah, and heard by the learned District Judge Terence Tay on the following dates:

> a.     20, 22 and 23 March 2018; and

> b.     22, 23, 24, 26 and 31 October 2018;

> c.     26 - 28 December 2018; and

> d.     1 - 5, 11, 12, 25 and 26 April 2019. (20 days in total to date)

13.    The Prosecution has yet to close its case, and has called a total of 15 witnesses thus far to prove its case against the Accused and his accomplices. All 10 victims of the charges for which the Accused was complicit in have already given evidence against him in Court.

**Facts relating to DAC 945326 of 2016 (3rd Charge)**

14.    The victim is Azman Bin Suptu (**“Azman”**), a 52-year old male Singaporean. At the material time of the offence, he was working as a crew for a food and beverage outlet, drawing a salary of less than S$1,331 per month.

15.    Sometime in or around 2012, Azman invested about S$22,400 with DAL in fish rearing in Batam. He was supposed to be able to retrieve his invested moneys at the end of his investments, as well as receive dividends for his investments. However, Azman did not receive the dividends due to him. Neither were his invested moneys returned to him.

16.    Subsequently, the Accused contacted Azman and told Azman that he could help him get a lawyer to recover the moneys he had invested in DAL. The Accused also brought Azman to see a lawyer at Surian & Partners, but the latter did not manage to help them recover his invested moneys and the dividends due to him.

17.    Sometime in or before April 2015, the Accused engaged in a conspiracy with Annie to cheat one Azman Bin Suptu (**“Azman”**).

18.    On 24 April 2015, the Accused called Azman, and told him that he has a friend from the Court who could help him to recover money from his investments with DAL. They agreed to meet on 25 April 2015.

19.    On 25 April 2015, the Accused met Azman and his wife along the road above Orchard MRT first, before proceeding to a café at ION shopping centre to meet Annie. Annie used the alias “Liyana” when she met Azman. The Accused lied and introduced Annie to them as the assistant of his friend from the Court. Annie also lied that she was working in the court. She told Azman and his wife that she could help Azman recover the money he lost. After introducing Annie to Azman and his wife, the Accused exited the café, but hanged around outside.

20.    Annie told Azman that Azman would be able to receive his claim monies (totalling S$59,800) if he paid a refundable processing fee of S$11,960. Annie showed Azman two documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS.

21.    Azman was deceived into believing that Annie’s representations to him were true. He also believed Annie because she had been introduced by the Accused, whom he trusted.

22.    As he did not have sufficient money to pay Annie, he made a phone call to his sister to request to borrow money from her. His sister agreed to lend him the money and the agreed arrangement was that his sister would come and deliver the money to his wife while he proceeded to work. Upon receiving the money from Azman’s sister, Azman’s wife handed S$11,960 in cash to Annie on Azman’s instructions.

23.    Eventually, Azman did not receive the sum of S$59,800 or the S$11,960 handed to Annie.

24.    On 28 June 2015, Azman lodged a police report about the case.

25.    The Accused and his accomplice knew that the documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS were fake and that Azman was not entitled to any claim monies. Accordingly, no money was due to the Accused and his accomplice from Azman.

26.    The Accused and his accomplice deceived Azman in order to cause wrongful gain to themselves, as well as wrongful loss to Azman.

27.    Azman was dishonestly induced to hand S$11,960 to Annie. He would not have done so had he known the truth.

**Facts relating to DAC No. 945328 of 2016 (5th Charge)**

28.    The first victim is Rubiah Bte Nasiman (“**Rubiah**”), a 68-year old female Singaporean. At the material time of the offence, she was working as a cleaner earning between S$1,220 and S$1,400 monthly.

29.    The second victim is Suneh Bin Dahlan (**“Suneh”**), a 70-year old male Singapore. At the material time of the offence, he was retired. Prior to retirement, he worked as a delivery man earning about S$1,500 – S$1,900 per month.

30.    Sometime in or around 2012, Rubiah and Suneh invested about S$112,000 and S$56,000 respectively with DAL in rubber and palm oil in Malaysia, fish farm and resort in Batam and cocoa plantation in Aceh. They were supposed to be able to retrieve their invested moneys at the end of their investments, as well as receive dividends for their investments. Rubiah and Suneh had dealt with the Accused during their investments at DAL. However, they did not receive the dividends due to them. Neither were their invested moneys returned to them.

31.    The Accused brought Rubiah and Suneh to see a lawyer at Surian & Partners, but the latter did not manage to help them recover their invested moneys and the dividends due to them.

32.    Sometime in or before April 2015, the Accused engaged in a conspiracy with Annie to cheat Rubiah and Suneh.

33.    On 27 April 2015, pursuant to the said conspiracy, the Accused called Rubiah and told her that her case with DAL was settled and that money could be claimed by Rubiah. The Accused lied to Rubiah that his friend “Liyana”, worked in the Court and could help Rubiah to obtain the money. They agreed to meet.

34.    The Accused met Rubiah and Suneh at Orchard MRT before bringing them to meet Annie at a café named Gluto at Takashimaya Shopping Centre. Annie used the alias “Liyana” when she met Rubiah and Suneh.

35.    Annie told Rubiah and Suneh that they need to pay a refundable handling fee of S$48,260. Annie also showed Rubiah and Suneh two documents each, purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS. The documents falsely stated that the Supreme Court of Singapore had processed the recovery of funds for Rubiah amounting to S$83,900 and for Suneh amounting to S$73,500, and they were required to pay a fee which was 20% of the recoverable amounts so that the recoverable amounts would be released to them. The fake documents were shown to Rubiah and Suneh in the Accused’s presence.

36.    Suneh was deceived into believing that Annie’s representations to them were true. He also believed Annie because she had been introduced by the Accused, whom he trusted. He therefore agreed to hand S$48,260 to Annie.

37.    When Rubiah and Suneh could not locate a POSB bank to withdraw money, Rubiah called the Accused for assistance. The Accused showed them the way to the POSB bank.

38.    Suneh subsequently withdrew the money and handed S$48,260 in cash to Annie.

39.    Eventually, Rubiah and Suneh did not receive the sum of S$157,400 or the S$48,260 handed to Annie.

40.    On 26 July 2015, Rubiah lodged a police report about the case.

41.    The Accused and his accomplice knew that the documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS were fake and that Rubiah and Suneh were not entitled to sums of S$83,900 and S$73,500 respectively. Accordingly, no money was due to the Accused and his accomplice from Rubiah and Suneh.

42.    The Accused and his accomplice deceived Rubiah and Suneh in order to cause wrongful gain to themselves, as well as wrongful loss to Rubiah and Suneh.

43.    Suneh was dishonestly induced to hand S$48,260 to Annie. He would not have done so had they known the truth.

**Facts relating to DAC No. 945329 of 2016 (6th Charge)**

44.    The victim is Kamisah Binti Rahim (“**Kamisah**”), a 59-year old female Singaporean. Between November 2010 and 2016, she was working odd jobs. In 2016, she started working as a library assistant.

45.    Between 2011 and 2013, Kamisah had invested about S$27,000 in one Amanah Nusah Indah (“**ANI**”) / DAL. Kamisah was supposed to receive yearly dividends for her investments after 2 years. However, she had only received around S$200 in dividends on one occasion.

46.    Sometime in or before May 2015, the Accused engaged in a conspiracy with Khairunnisa, Annie and Noorfauziah to cheat Kamisah.

47.    On 16 May 2015, pursuant to the said conspiracy, Khairunnisa called Kamisah regarding her investments with ANI. Khairunnisa used the alias “Kartini” when she spoke with Kamisah. Khairunnisa asked Kamisah if she wanted to recover the moneys she had invested in ANI. Khairunnisa claimed that she was also an investor of ANI, and she had managed to get back her money from ANI. Khairunnisa told Kamisah that her friend, “Shafiq”, could help Kamisah to do so. Khairunnisa then gave Kamisah the Accused’s contact number.

48.    On 16 May 2015, Kamisah called the Accused and they agreed to meet on 18 May 2015. The Accused used the alias “Shafiq” when he spoke to Kamisah. He also introduced himself as a former staff of ANI, and told Kamisah that he had met her previously. He told Kamisah that he could bring Kamisah to meet his friend, who could help her recover the moneys she had invested in ANI.

49.    On 18 May 2015, the Accused brought Kamisah in a car from her home to a café at a hotel at Havelock Road to meet Noorfauziah. When Noorfauziah arrived, the Accused went out of the café to wait.

50.    Noorfauziah used the alias “Erni” when she met Kamisah, and she introduced herself to Kamisah as “Officer Erni”. Noorfauziah told Kamisah that she was a staff from the Supreme Court, and Kamisah would be able to recover S$59,950 from her investment with ANI if she paid a refundable security deposit of S$11,990. Noorfauziah showed Kamisah two documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS. The documents falsely stated that the Supreme Court of Singapore had processed the recovery of funds for Kamisah amounting to S$59,950 and she was required to pay a fee which was 20% of the recoverable amount so that the recoverable amount would be released to her.

51.    Kamisah was deceived into believing that Noorfauziah’s representations to her were true. She therefore agreed to hand S$11,990 to Noorfauziah. However, she did not have enough money in her bank account, and she told Noorfauziah so. Noorfauziah then suggested that she borrow the money from others. She told Kamisah that if she (Kamisah) failed to make the payment on that day, the “offer” would cease. Kamisah therefore asked her husband to transfer S$400 into her bank account, and asked her brother to lend her S$8,000.

52.    The Accused, who had been waiting outside the café, then brought Kamisah and her brother (when he arrived) to a bank and ATM machines at Plaza Singapura, Takashimaya Shopping Centre and Chinatown to withdraw money to pay Noorfauziah.

53.    Kamisah subsequently handed S$11,990 in cash to Noorfauziah.

54.    Eventually, Kamisah did not receive the sum of S$59,950 or the S$11,990 she handed to Noorfauziah.

55.    On 21 July 2015, Kamisah lodged a police report about the case.

56.    The Accused and his accomplices knew that the documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS were fake and that Kamisah was not entitled to any sum of S$59,950. Accordingly, no money was due to the Accused and his accomplices from Kamisah.

57.    The Accused and his accomplices deceived Kamisah in order to cause wrongful gain to themselves, as well as wrongful loss to Kamisah.

58.    Kamisah was dishonestly induced to hand $11,990 to Noorfauziah. She would not have done so had she known the truth.

**Facts relating to DAC No. 945330 of 2016 (7th Charge)**

59.    The victim is Kamisah Binte Da’ee (**“Da’ee”**), a 64-year old female Singaporean. She worked in a factory as a machine operator, earning less than S$1,200 plus a month.

60.    Sometime in or around 2012, Da’ee invested S$90,000 plus with DAL in fish farming in Batam and rubber plantations in Aceh. Da’ee was supposed to be able to retrieve her invested moneys at the end of her investments, as well as receive dividends for her investments. Da’ee had dealt with the Accused during her investments at DAL. However, she did not receive the dividends due to her. Neither were her invested moneys returned to her.

61.    The Accused brought Da’ee to see a lawyer at Surian & Partners, but the latter did not manage to help her recover her invested moneys and the dividends due to her.

62.    Sometime in or before April 2015, the Accused engaged in a conspiracy with Annie and Noorfauziah to cheat Da’ee.

63.    On 28 April 2015, pursuant to the said conspiracy, the Accused called Da’ee. As Da’ee was busy, she returned the Accused’s call subsequently. The Accused told Da’ee to meet him regarding her investment with DAL. They agreed to meet later on the same day at Orchard MRT.

64.    Upon arriving at Orchard MRT, the Accused brought Da’ee to a café at Paragon, where he told Da’ee to wait for his friend, “Sharifah”, who was working in Court. The Accused told Da’ee that “Sharifah” would be able to help her recover money from DAL.

65.    About 20 minutes later, Noorfauziah came to meet the Accused and Da’ee. Noorfauziah used the alias “Sharifah” when she met Da’ee.

66.    Noorfauziah told Da’ee that she (Da’ee) would be able to recover S$162,900 from her investment with DAL if she paid a refundable deposit of S$32,580. Noorfauziah also showed Binte Da’ee two documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS. The documents falsely stated that the Supreme Court of Singapore had processed the recovery of funds for Da’ee amounting to S$162,900 and she was required to pay a fee which was 20% of the recoverable amount so that the recoverable amount would be released to her. The Accused was not present when Noorfauziah explained the fake documents to Da’ee.

67.    Da’ee was deceived into believing that Noorfauziah’s representations to her were true. She took a look at her POSB bank book which she had brought along with her, and told Noorfauziah that she did not have enough money to pay the S$32,580. However, she would pawn her jewellery to raise funds after she returned home. Noorfauziah replied “okay”.

68.    Thereafter, the Accused re-appeared and brought Da’ee to a POSB bank at Paragon, where she withdrew S$13,000. The Accused then brought Da’ee back to the café, where she handed S$12,580 to Noorfauziah.

69.    Upon returning home, Da’ee pawned her jewellery before returning to the café at Paragon to hand another S$13,000 to Noorfauziah. The Accused had arranged for her to meet her at the taxi stand at Paragon so that he could bring her to meet Noorfauziah. In total, Da’ee handed S$25,580 in cash to Noorfauziah.

70.    When Da’ee told Noorfauziah that she could not raise any more money, Noorfauziah agreed that she could just pay S$25,580.

71.    Eventually, Da’ee did not receive the sum of S$162,900 or the S$25,580 she had handed to Noorfauziah.

72.    On 27 July 2015, Da’ee lodged a police report about the case.

73.    The Accused and his accomplices knew that the documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS were fake and that Da’ee was not entitled to any sum of S$162,900. Accordingly, no money was due to the Accused and his accomplices from Da’ee.

74.    The Accused and his accomplices deceived Da’ee in order to cause wrongful gain to themselves, as well as wrongful loss to Da’ee.

75.    Da’ee was dishonestly induced to hand S$25,580 to Noorfauziah. She would not have done so had she known the truth.

**Facts relating to DAC No. 945331 of 2016 (8th Charge)**

76.    The victim is Siti Aminah Binti Ismail (“**Siti**”), a 70-year old female Singaporean. She used to make a living out of selling Malay _kueh_, which gave her $3,000 monthly, before deducting her costs.

77.    Between 2012 and 2013, Siti, together with her husband, had invested S$85,500 with S.E.A Venture Pte Ltd (“**SEAV**”) for fish farming in Indonesia, and S$120,000 with Global Food Enterprise (“**GFE**”) for a fast food business, known as Chikano. The Accused had approached Siti for the investments in SEAV. According to the victim, the Accused was also working for Chikano. Siti and her husband were supposed to be able to retrieve their invested moneys at the end of their investments. They were also supposed to receive dividends for their investments. However, they did not receive the dividends due to them. Neither were their invested moneys returned to them.

78.    Sometime in or before May 2015, the Accused engaged in a conspiracy with Annie and Khairunnisa to cheat Siti.

79.    On 14 May 2015, pursuant to the said conspiracy, Annie (using mobile number XXX) called Siti. When Annie spoke with Siti, she used the alias “Nur Liyana Binte Abdullah”. Annie lied to Siti that she was a lawyer working “undercover” and directed by the Court of Singapore to look for victims like Siti to return their capital invested in SEAV and GFE, and that she could help Siti get back her capital invested with SEAV and GFE. When Siti asked Annie how she had obtained her contact number, Annie told her that “\[her\] case was in the system”. They agreed to meet on 15 May 2015. Siti was to wait at home on 15 May 2015, and Annie would send a car and her assistant to bring Siti to meet her.

80.    On 15 May 2015, Khairunnisa met Siti and brought Siti and her husband in a car to Memo café at Studio M Hotel to meet Annie. Khairunnisa introduced herself as the assistant of “Nur Liyana Binte Abdullah” (Annie) to Siti and her husband.

81.    Annie was already at the café when Khairunnisa arrived with Siti and Siti’s husband. The Accused[^10] introduced Annie to Siti and her husband as “\[her\] boss”. All four of them then sat down at a table. Khairunnisa sat just behind Annie. Khairunnisa was able to hear what Annie was telling Siti and her husband.

82.    Annie reiterated that she was an “undercover” lawyer and that she had been directed by the Court of Singapore to look for people like Siti and her husband to, first, stop companies who were involved in cheating, and secondly, get back the capital they have invested into SEAV and GFE, as well as the profits. Annie dressed in a black attire when she met Siti and her husband, and she looked like a lawyer. She also spoke well in Malay and looked smart. Annie also showed Siti and her husband many files which she claimed pertained to the people she had helped to get back their capital or were in the process of getting back their capital. Annie then told Siti that she has to pay a fee of S$114,008 to proceed with the case in order to get her capital back and to proceed with the case to make claims against SEAV. The claims against GFE were to be made on a later date. Annie also showed Siti one document purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore which had a court seal and also a case number. Annie also said that “in the name of Allah, she would get the money back”.

83.    Siti was deceived into believing that Annie’s representations to her were true. She therefore agreed to hand S$114,008 to Annie.

84.    Siti did not have enough money to pay Annie, and she told Annie so. She also told Annie that she would ask her sister to lend her S$110,000. Khairunnisa was also within earshot, and was looking at Siti, when she spoke to Annie about this.

85.    Subsequently, Siti borrowed $110,000 from her sister and withdrew S$4,008 from her joint account with her husband to pay Annie. Annie arranged for a car to send Siti and her husband to Centrepoint, where Siti’s sister withdrew and passed her S$110,000. Thereat, Siti also withdrew S$4,008 from the bank account she held with her husband.

86.    Thereafter, Siti and her husband were driven back to Memo café at Studio M Hotel in the same car. At the café, Siti handed S$114,008 in cash to Annie. Khairunnisa was no longer at the café by this time.

87.    Although the Accused did not meet Siti and her husband, he was in the vicinity, waiting to split the moneys cheated from Siti, as he had provided Siti’s contact to the team.

88.    Eventually, Siti did not receive the capital invested in SEAV or the sum of S$114,008.

89.    On 2 July 2015, Siti lodged a police report about the case.

90.    The Accused and his accomplices knew that the document purportedly issued by the Court was fake and no money was due to the Accused and his accomplices from Siti.

91.    The Accused and his accomplices deceived Siti in order to cause wrongful gain to themselves, as well as wrongful loss to Siti.

92.    Siti was dishonestly induced to hand S$114,008 to Annie. She would not have done so had she known the truth.

95.    One Gadafi subsequently introduced the Accused to Kamariah for the purpose of engaging a lawyer to act for her against DAL. The Accused brought Kamariah to see a lawyer at Surian & Partners, but the latter did not manage to help her recover her invested moneys and the dividends due to her.

96.    Sometime in or before April 2015, the Accused engaged in a conspiracy with Annie and Noorfauziah to cheat Kamariah.

98.    At Changi Hotel, the Accused introduced Kamariah to Annie and Noorfauziah. The Accused introduced Noorfauziah as “Sharifah” to Kamariah. He also said that “Sharifah” worked at the Small Claims Tribunal. Annie, on the other hand, used the alias “Nur Liyana” and told Kamariah that she was a lawyer.

99.    Annie told Kamariah that Kamariah would be able to recover S$147,000 from her investment with DAL if she paid a fee of S$29,400. Annie also showed Kamariah two documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS. The documents falsely stated that the Supreme Court of Singapore had processed the recovery of funds for Kamariah amounting to S$147,000 and she was required to pay a fee which was 20% of the recoverable amount so that the recoverable amount would be released to her.

100.       While Annie spoke to Kamariah, the Accused sat at the same table and listened to their conversation. Noorfauziah was also able to hear what Annie was telling Kamariah.

101.       Kamariah was deceived into believing that Annie’s representations to her were true because of the 2 documents shown to her. She also believed Annie because Annie and Noorfauziah had been introduced to her by the Accused, who had helped her engage a lawyer previously. She therefore agreed to hand S$29,400 to Annie.

102.       The Accused brought Kamariah to a POSB bank at Pasir Ris to withdraw money to pay Annie. After Kamariah had withdrawn the money, he brought her back to Changi Hotel. Kamariah then handed S$29,400 to Annie.

103.       Eventually, Kamariah did not receive the sum of S$147,000 or the S$29,400 she had handed to Annie.

104.       On 13 July 2015, Kamariah lodged a police report about the case.

105.       The Accused and his accomplices knew that the documents purportedly issued by the Supreme Court of Singapore and the MAS were fake and that Kamariah was not entitled to any sum of S$147,000. Accordingly, no money was due to the Accused and his accomplices from Kamariah.

106.       The Accused and his accomplices deceived Kamariah in order to cause wrongful gain to themselves, as well as wrongful loss to Kamariah.

107.       Kamariah was dishonestly induced to hand S$29,400 to Annie. She would not have done so had she known the truth.
