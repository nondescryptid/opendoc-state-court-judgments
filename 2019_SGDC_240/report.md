### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused had pleaded guilty to two offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185 (“MDA”). These were –

> (i)     One count of possession of 0.54 grams of diamorphine under s 8(a) punishable under s 33(1) MDA was taken into consideration (DAC 927647/18); and

> (ii)     One count of possession of 4.45 grams of methamphetamine under s 8(a) punishable under s 33(1) MDA. (DAC 927648/18).

2       The Accused had initially claimed trial to the charges, but he pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial. He was represented by Mr Wee Hong Shern.

3       One count of failing to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse, under s 31(2) punishable under s 33A(2) MDA (DAC 917304/18) was withdrawn. He was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on this charge.

**THE FACTS**

4       The Accused was arrested on 15 May 18 at about 11.05 pm at Jalan Bukit Merah. He had on him two purses and some ziplock bags. The ziplock bags contained brown and crystalline granular substances. HSA analysis revealed that the brown granular substances were diamorphine with a total weight of not less than 0.54 grams (the charge in DAC 927647/18), and the crystalline granular substances were methamphetamine with a total weight of not less than 4.45 grams (the charge in DAC 927648/18). They were the subject matter of the proceeded charges.

## THE SENTENCE

6       DPP Pavithra Ramkumar sought a sentence of at least four years’ imprisonment for each charge. She highlighted his two prior antecedents for possession of cannabis, with the most recent on 7 Nov 05 whereby he was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. She pointed out that it was apparent that he had not been deterred. Therefore, a stiffer sentence was merited.

7       Mr Wee pointed out the Accused’s remorse and accepted that he was looking at a long sentence of imprisonment. He nevertheless asked for leniency and Mr Wee argued that a sentence of three years six months’ imprisonment for each charge was appropriate under the circumstances. He also asked that the two sentences ran concurrently.

8       I noted the Accused’s MDA antecedents, and in particular, his possession antecedents. He had three such antecedents, the most recent being in November 2005. On that occasion, he was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. It was pertinent to note that soon after his release from prison, he committed trafficking in another Class A controlled drug, diamorphine. He was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. Undeterred, and soon after his release, he re-offended with the present set of possession offences. Both offences involved Class A drugs. There is clearly a need for deterrence, especially specific deterrence, as his previous transgressions and punishments had no effect on him. On his plea of guilty, its mitigating weight was reduced given that he had only done so on the first day of trial. Work had been done in preparation for the trial, witnesses had been summoned to appear, and valuable trial days have been lost.

9       Therefore, I agreed with the learned DPP that a sentence of four years’ imprisonment on each charge was warranted and appropriate. Mindful of the one-transaction rule, I ordered that the two sentences run concurrently.

10     The Accused has appealed against the sentence. He is currently serving his sentence.
