### District Judge Lim Tse Haw:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused person, Lee Chiew Yan (“the Accused”) claimed trial to one charge summarised as follows:

MCN 902249/2017

On 9 October 2016 at or about 10.07 a.m., at the multi-storey car park at Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre located at 30, Seng Poh Road, Singapore, the Accused did commit mischief by scratching the left side of the motor car bearing registration no. SDS 3355J belonging to one Wong Chiu Giau Nellie, thereby causing damage to the amount of $7395.14, which is an offence punishable under Section 427 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved its case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused of the charge. I now set out below the full grounds for my decision.

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

#### (A)    Background Facts

3       The background facts leading to the commission of the offence were largely not in dispute at the trial. Briefly, on 9 October 2016 at about 10.07 a.m., at the multi-storey car park at Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre (“the Car Park”), both the Accused and one Wong Chiu Giau Nellie (“the Complainant”)[^1] were waiting in their cars to park in the same parking lot. When the car which was then occupying the lot moved out of the lot, there was a dispute between the Accused and the Complainant as to who was entitled to park in that lot. After a short stand-off, the Accused decided to move her car away and the Complainant then reverse-parked her car in the lot. Shortly thereafter, the Accused found another lot, just opposite and to the left of the Complainant’s lot. The Accused then parked her car in that lot.

#### (B)   The Complainant’s Evidence

4       After parking her car, the Complainant locked her car and left to do some marketing in the Tiong Bahru Market. When she returned to her car about 20-30 minutes later, she noticed a long continuous scratch mark on the left side of her car[^2], starting from somewhere just below the left rear light of the car, running along the left side of the car, across the left rear passenger door, all the way until the middle of the left front passenger door.[^3]

5       The Complainant said she was sure that the scratch was not there before the incident as her domestic helper would wash her car every morning and she would have informed her if there were such a scratch that morning when she washed the car. It also could not have been caused on her way to the Tiong Bahru market as she was not involved in any accident. As there was an in-car camera installed in her car, with the help of her husband[^4], the relevant footage capturing the incident was retrieved and admitted as evidence at the trial without any objection from the Defence.[^5]

#### (C)   What the Relevant Footage Showed

6       The relevant footage showed that when the car which was then parked in the lot moved out, the Accused tried to reverse park her car into the lot while the Complainant moved her car (which was behind the Accused’s car) forward, thus blocking the Accused’s car from reversing into the lot. Both cars then stopped. After a short stand-off, the Accused was seen coming out of her car and approached the Complainant’s car. The Complainant said the Accused then knocked on the window on the driver side of her car. When the Complainant wound down the window, the Accused asked her “_now what do you want?”_ The Complainant told the Accused that she had arrived at the lot first. The Accused then told her it was not a question of who came first but who got to the lot first. The Complainant then wound up her window. She said the Accused then shouted “_you bloody asshole”_ at her, and walked back to her car. The Complainant said she then took a picture of the Accused’s car as the Accused was aggressive and in case the Accused were to harm her. The footage then showed both of them waited a few more seconds before the Accused drove away. The Complainant then reverse-parked into the lot. She then left her car and went to do her marketing.

7       After a short while, the footage showed the Accused approaching the Complainant’s car from the front left. She then walked to the right side of the car from the front. She was seen holding a purse in her left hand. As she was walking towards the right of the car, she seemed to be transferring something from her left hand to her right hand. She continued walking to the front right of the Complainant’s car until she was out of the view of the footage. She next appeared in the footage at the right rear of the Complainant’s car. She was seen looking over the parapet behind the Complainant’s car, then walked from the right to the left of the car at the rear until she was again out of the view of the footage. She next appeared in the footage at the front left of the Complainant’s car and walked away from the car from the front left.

8       After the Complainant discovered that her car was scratched, she saw that the Accused’s car was still at the car park. She then called the police and told the police that “_(a) lady just scratched my car and she is still here. I have CCTV.”[^6]_ She also called her brother who subsequently came to the Car Park. When the police arrived at the scene, the Complainant told the police officer to check the Accused’s car key but the police officer told the Complainant that they were not able to do so as they had many cases to attend to.

9       As a result of the scratch, the Complainant sent her car, a BMW 7 Series, to Performance Motors Limited (“PML”) for repair. The cost of repair came up to $7395.14.[^7]

10     In cross-examination, it was put to the Complainant that the Accused was walking towards the staircase at Exit B of the car park when she was seen approaching the Complainant’s car from the front right of the car in the footage. The Complainant disagreed and pointed out that the staircase at Exit B of the car park was to the far right side of her car where it was parked, and not behind her car to the right as shown in the sketch plan drawn by the investigations officer (“IO”) in P13.[^8]

11     It was further put to the Complainant that when the Accused was seen in the footage walking _away_ from the Complainant’s car from the left, she was walking back to her car to retrieve her mobile phone, and thereafter she walked towards lift B.[^9] The Complainant said that she would not know.

#### (D)   The Evidence of the Domestic Helper

12     Miss Sri Widayati, the Complainant’s domestic helper (“Widayati”)[^10], testified that she would wash the Complainant’s car every morning at about 7.00 to 7.30 a.m. On the morning of the day of the incident, she washed the car as usual and she did not notice any scratch on the car. Later in the morning, the Complainant called her and asked her if she saw any “line” on the car when she was washing the car. Widayati said no. She identified what she referred to as the “line” as the scratch as shown in P10, from somewhere below the back light beside the licence plate to the front passenger door just below the door handle. She said if she were to notice such a scratch when she was washing the car, she would have told the Complainant about it.

## THE DEFENCE’S CASE

#### The Accused’s Evidence

13     The Accused testified that on the day of the incident, she was waiting for a car park lot at the Car Park for about two minutes when she noticed that a car was trying to emerge from a lot just behind her car. She moved her car forward to allow the car to emerge. When she tried to reverse park her car into the lot, the Complainant suddenly just rushed her car forward to try to take that lot. No indicator signal was given. She then came down from her car and approached the Complainant. The Accused said she could have asked the Complainant “_what do you want?”._ She cannot remember what exactly she had said to the Complainant but her intention was to ask her nicely. The Accused said although she was always loud, she denied using any foul language at the Complainant. After a conversation of about 20-30 seconds with the Complainant, she decided to wait for another lot. Another lot soon became available and she parked her car in that lot.

14     The Accused then walked towards the staircase at Exit B. She said at that time she was not conscious of the route she was taking.[^11] She then noticed that the Complainant’s car was still parked at the same lot. She then walked along the right side of the Complainant’s car. When she reached the aisle between the car and the parapet behind the Complainant’s car[^12], she remembered that she had forgotten to take her mobile phone. She then walked back to her car to retrieve her mobile phone. She did this by walking around the Complainant’s car from the back and along the left side of the car. After retrieving her mobile phone, she went to the market by walking along the aisle between _her car_ and the parapet.[^13] She spent about an hour at the market. When she came back from the market to her car, she saw that a man was taking pictures of either her or her car. He was with the Complainant. She said there was a commotion but she just ignored it and drove home. The Accused denied causing the scratch on the Complainant’s car as shown in P9 to P12. She said there was no reason for her to do so as she was not upset with the Complainant for taking the parking lot.

15     In cross-examination, when asked by the learned deputy public prosecutor (DPP) if it would have been more logical for her to take the same route to walk back to her car when she realised that she had forgotten her mobile phone, instead of going one round around the Complainant’s car as seen in the footage, the Accused said she cannot explain if that would have been more logical or not but said that that was how “_most of us will walk”[^14]_.

16     When asked by the Court why she did not just walk directly from where she had parked her car to the staircase at Exit B but instead took a rather roundabout way of walking beside the Complainant’s car, the Accused said that the route she took was shorter as it was a “diagonal route” whereas the direct route from where she had parked her car to the staircase at Exit B was an L-shape route, which was longer.[^15]

17     The DPP also put the Accused that from the footage, when she was approaching the front right of the Complainant’s car, she was seen transferring something from her left hand to her right hand and that she had used it to scratch the Complainant’s car. The Accused disagreed.

18     When asked by the Court why she had said in her police statement[^16] at \[3\] that she took the staircase down to the market after she had retrieved her mobile phone from the car when it was her evidence in court during cross examination that she took lift B, the Accused at first said that she had made a mistake in her police statement as she had always taken the staircase down to the market.[^17]

19     However, when the trial resumed after the lunch break, the Accused changed her evidence and claimed that she “_cannot remember exactly_” whether she had taken lift B to the market and that normally she “_would have gone down the staircase_”. She then explained that as the police statement was taken only days after the incident, her recollection of the incident was probably fresher then and hence she had “_probably_” taken the staircase down.[^18]

20     When asked by the DPP why she did not take the same route to go the staircase at Exit B after retrieving her mobile phone from her car, i.e, by walking past the Complainant’s car again, the Accused explained that as by this time she was already at the back of her car, as opposed to at the driver side of her car earlier, it was natural for her to walk along the aisle behind her car to go to the staircase at Exit B.[^19]

## MY DECISION

#### (A)   The Law on Circumstantial Evidence

21     It was not in dispute at the close of the trial that the Prosecution relied solely on circumstantial evidence to prove the charge against the Accused. It is trite law that the circumstantial evidence on which the prosecution relies must, in the final analysis, “inevitably and inexorably” lead the court to a single conclusion of the accused’s guilt- _PP v Chee Cheong Hin Constance_ \[2006\] 2 SLR (R) 24 at \[77\]. Further, the standard of proof required to prove the accused’s guilt is that of beyond a reasonable doubt.[^20] On what amounts to beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court of Appeal in _Took Leng How v PP [^21]_ at \[28\] cited the following passage by Denning J in _Miller v Ministry of Pensions_ \[1947\] 2 All ER 372 at 373 with approval:

_“That degree is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence “of course it is possible but not in the least probable,” the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.”_

#### (B)   An Assessment of the Circumstantial Evidence

22     The key circumstantial evidence relied on by the Prosecution to prove its case was as follows:

i.     Before the dispute between the Accused and the Complainant over the parking lot on 9 October 2016, the scratch mark was not found on the left side of the Complainant’s car;

ii.     After the Complainant had parked her car and left for the market after the dispute, the Accused had approached the car from the front right side of the car, walked along the right side of the car to the back of the car, she then moved from the right to the left at the back of the car and emerged from the left side of the car at the front. This was captured in the footage from the in-car camera of the Complainant’s car;

iii.     When the Complainant came back from her marketing shortly thereafter, she saw the scratch mark on the left side of the car.

23     The key issue that I had to decide at the close of the case was whether the cumulative effect of the above circumstantial evidence was such that, in the final analysis, inevitably and inexorably led me to a single conclusion of the Accused’s guilt.

24     In coming to my decision in the present case, I made the following findings of fact:

#### i.   The scratch mark was not found on the left side of the Complainant’s car before the dispute

25     I found that the scratch mark was _not_ present on the Complainant’s car _before_ the dispute over the parking lot between the Accused and the Complainant. In coming to this finding, I accepted the evidence of the Complainant’s helper, Widayati, that she did not notice the scratch mark in the morning of 9 October 2016 when she washed the car. Widayati had given evidence in a straightforward manner and there was no basis for me to doubt her credibility.

26     I was also satisfied that the car was _not_ involved in any incident or accident on that day which may have caused the presence of the scratch mark on the car during the journey from the Complainant’s house until she had parked the car at the Car Park. Having examined the Complainant’s evidence carefully, I found the Complainant to be a credible witness and accepted her evidence that she was not involved in any such incident or accident prior to parking her car at the Car Park.

27     It was the Defence’s case that the scratch mark could have been caused by the people who were seen walking past the car in the footage. However, having examined the footage carefully, it was my considered decision that the scratch mark _could not_ have been caused by these people. First, these people were seen walking at some distance from the car which rendered it highly unlikely, if not impossible, for any of them to have caused the scratch. Second, the manner in which these people were seen walking past the car showed that they were merely going about doing their own things. Their manners were natural and did not exhibit any intention in wanting to cause damage to the car. This is to be contrasted with the unnatural and surreptitious manner in which the Accused was seen approaching the Complainant’s car in the footage. I will elaborate on this further in the later part of this judgement. Third, the Complainant was still in her car waiting for a parking lot when these people were seen walking past her car. She would have known if any of them were to cause such a long scratch on her car.

#### ii.   There was no reason for the Accused to approach the Complainant’s car in the manner seen in the footage if she had merely intended to walk from her car to the market

28     The Accused had given evidence that she was merely walking from where she had parked her car to the staircase at Exit B when she was seen approaching the Complainant’s car in the footage. She also explained that because she had left her mobile phone in the boot of her car, she had to walk back to her car to retrieve her mobile phone, hence she was seen walking away from the Complainant’s car back to her car. I did not accept her evidence for the following reasons:

i.     She was not able to give a consistent account on _why_ she took the route as shown in the footage. During her oral evidence, she said it was because she wanted to take the staircase at Exit B down to the market;

ii.     However, during cross-examination, she said eventually she took the lift down;

iii.     When it was pointed out to her that she had said in her statement in D3 that she took the stairs, she answered, without hesitation, that she had made a mistake in the statement due to the fact that she had always been taking the stairs down to the market;

iv.     However, in later part of her cross-examination, she changed her evidence and at first said that she could no longer remember if she took the stairs or the lift. Then she added that since the statement in D3 was recorded on 17 Oct 2016, soon after the incident, it was probably correct, namely, that she had taken the staircase.

29     Having considered the totality of the evidence adduced at the trial, I did not find the Accused’s explanations above to be credible. It was clear to me that the Accused had to say in her statement in D3 that she took the staircase down instead of the lift _in order to_ explain why she had approached the Complainant’s car, when it would have been more logical for her to walk directly to the lift at the lift lobby B along the pedestrian aisle behind her car without having to go anywhere near the Complainant’s car, if she had intended to take the lift at lift lobby B down to the market.

30     However, when the footage showed that she had _in fact_ walked towards the direction of the lift at lift lobby B after she had returned to her car from the Complainant’s car, she had to concede that she had in fact taken the lift and (initially) took the position that she had made a mistake in her statement. However, she then probably realised that this would also mean that she had no reason to approach the Complainant’s car in the way that she did _in the first place_. Hence, eventually she decided to change her evidence to say that she cannot remember whether she took the staircase or the lift but she probably had taken the staircase because the statement was recorded closer to the event. This has rendered her evidence not credible at all.

31     I also found her explanation at \[20\] above on why she had changed her route to go to the staircase after she had retrieved her mobile phone from her car to be contrived and one which did not accord with common sense. As I have said in \[29\] above, it would have been more logical for her to walk directly to the lift at the lift lobby B along the pedestrian aisle _behind_ her car without having to go anywhere near the Complainant’s car, if she had intended to take the lift at lift lobby B down to the market. This was regardless of whether she was at the driver side of the car or at the boot of the car. In my judgment, she had lied when she said that she took the staircase in her statement in D3 out of realisation of guilt because she needed to explain why she had approached the Complainant’s car _in the first place_. However, her lie was caught out by the footage when it showed that she had _in fact_ walked towards the direction of the lift at lift lobby B.

#### iii. The Accused had approached the Complainant’s car in an unnatural and surreptitious manner

32     In my judgement, the Accused’s behaviour in approaching the Complainant’s car was unnatural and surreptitious for the following reasons:

i.     I agreed with the Prosecution that when the Accused reached the Complainant’s car near the front right, she was seen to be transferring something from her left hand to her right. The Accused herself admitted that her car key was in her right hand when she was walking around the Complainant’s car[^22];

ii.     When she reached the back of the Complainant’s car on the right, instead of turning to her left to go to the staircase (as she claimed was her intention), she turned to her right and pretended to look down the parapet. In my judgment, this unnatural action of hers was in fact her way of trying to make her presence at the back of the Complainant’s car looked less suspicious, so that she appeared to other people to be merely searching or looking out for something at the back of a car. Further, I did not accept the Accused’s explanation that she had left her mobile phone in her car. In my judgment, this was another one of the Accused’s lies to explain why she was seen walking around the back of the Complainant’s car from the right to the left instead of turning to her left to go to the staircase at Exit B;

iii.     It was also unnatural for her to be leaning so close to the Complainant’s car as she was walking from the right to the left at the back of the Complainant’s car. If she were merely making one round at the back of the Complainant’s car to return to her car to retrieve her mobile phone as she had claimed, there was no need for her to lean so close to the Complainant’s car.

33     In my judgement, the Accused had approached the Complainant’s car in such an unnatural and surreptitious manner as described above so as to conceal her action of scratching the Complainant’s car using, most likely, her car key which she had admitted was in her right hand at the material time.

34     The Accused also had a motive to want to cause damage to the Complainant’s car. Contrary to her claim in court that she was not upset with the Complainant for taking the parking lot which she was also waiting for, she was clearly upset with the Complainant for having done so, as I accepted the Complainant’s evidence that the Accused had scolded the Complainant for taking the lot with the words as set out in \[6\] above.

#### iv.   The scratch mark, which was not present on the left side of the car when the Complainant left the car, was present after the Accused was seen walking around the car and when the Complainant returned to her car shortly thereafter

35     After the Accused was seen in the footage walking around the Complainant’s car in an unnatural and surreptitious manner as described above, when the Complainant returned to her car after her marketing, she found the scratch mark on the left side of her car which was not there when she first parked the car. It was the Defence’s case that the scratch mark could have been caused by the passers-by who were seen walking past the Complainant’s car when she was still waiting for a lot, or by someone whose act was not captured in the footage because of the “jump” in the footage.[^23] The short answer to this submission is that it is not in the least probable as the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence against the Accused is so strong as to leave me in no doubt that it was the Accused who had caused the scratch mark on the Complainant’s car.

36     In the circumstances, in view of the above findings of fact, it was my judgment that the cumulative effect of the above circumstantial evidence was such that, in the final analysis, inevitably and inexorably led me to a single conclusion of the Accused’s guilt.

#### (C)   The Repair Cost of $7395.14

37     It was the Defence’s submission that the Complainant ought to have engaged an independent surveyor to assess the extent of damage and cost of repair as this may lead to a lower repair cost. In my judgment, the Complainant’s car was only about 10-month old at the time of the offence. She had every right to send the car back to PML, which is the exclusive distributor for BMW cars in Singapore, for repair. Further, this was not an accident case where extensive damage was caused to the car, in which case it would have been reasonable for the Complainant to engage an independent surveyor to assess the extent of damage and cost of repair. On the contrary, engaging an independent surveyor to assess the extent of damage and cost of repair for such a scratch mark would have unnecessarily increased the cost that the Complainant would have to pay in order to repair her car. In any event, the Defence did not adduce any evidence to show that the scratch mark could have been repaired at a lower cost. In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the sum of $7395.14 was reasonably incurred by the Complainant in order to remove the scratch mark from her car.

38     I therefore found the Accused guilty of the charge and convicted her accordingly.

## SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE BY THE PROSECUTION

39     The Prosecution submitted for a custodial sentence to be imposed on the Accused but left the duration of the custodial sentence to the court. The Prosecution relied on the following three grounds[^24] for submitting for a custodial sentence:

i.     Lack of remorse on the Accused’s part as she was convicted after a full trial;

ii.     The act committed by the Accused was vengeful and malicious, with revenge over the parking lot incident as a motive. This was an aggravating factor;

iii.     The value of the damage sustained by the Complainant was high: $7395.14. No compensation was made by the Accused to the Complainant for the damage.

40     The Prosecution also tendered a table of sentencing precedents for the offence of mischief under section 427 of the Penal Code arising from road incidents. Out of the seven cases in the table, fines were imposed in six cases, ranging from $3000 to $4800.[^25] Only in one case where a sentence of one week imprisonment was imposed after an appeal to the High Court.[^26]

## MITIGATION AND SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE BY THE DEFENCE

41     In mitigation, Counsel for the Accused informed that the Accused was the sole care giver for her 86 years-old mother who had suffered multiple fractures in the ribs recently due to a fall. The Defence repeated its submission reproduced in \[37\] above that the Complainant ought to have engaged an independent surveyor to assess the extent of damage and cost of repair, as this may lead to a lower repair cost. He also submitted for a fine to be imposed.[^27]

## THE SENTENCE

42     As noted in \[40\] above, in six out of the seven cases cited in the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents, fines were imposed. In the only case where a sentence of one week imprisonment term was imposed by the High Court after an appeal,[^28] the facts of that case showed that substantial violence was used by the offender, in that there was a fight at first and the offender then went on to use a bamboo stick to smash the headlight of the victim’s car. In my judgment, the substantial violence used in that case constituted a significant aggravating factor which warranted a short custodial sentence being imposed. In the present case, although the damage caused was high, none of the above substantial violence was found in the facts. Further, in my judgment, the mere fact that an accused person was found guilty after a full trial, without more, should generally not result in a more serious sentence of a _different nature_ being imposed, than the appropriate sentence that would have been imposed had the accused person pleaded guilty. It should generally result in an accused person losing the usual discount in sentencing that would have been imposed had the accused person pleaded guilty.

43     In the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents, the facts in _PP v Zaidi Bin Ali[^29]_ were similar to the present case: there was also a dispute over a parking lot between the offender and the victim, with the victim eventually parking in the disputed lot. The offender pleaded guilty to causing a 40 cm scratch mark at the rear right fender of the victim’s car. The cost of the repair was $2354 and the offender made a restitution of $1000 to the victim. The offender was fined $4500. Given that the Accused in the present case was found guilty after a full trial and the damage caused was much higher at $$7395.14, with no restitution having been made by the Accused, I imposed a higher fine of $8,000 on the Accused, in default eight weeks’ imprisonment.

44     I also considered it appropriate that the Accused should compensate the Complainant for the repair cost incurred as it was a direct consequence of the Accused’s offence. In the circumstances, I made a compensation order against the Accused under section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) for her to pay the repair cost of $7395.14 to the Complainant, in default seven weeks’ imprisonment.

45     Being dissatisfied with the above judgement, the Accused has appealed against both conviction and sentence. She has since paid the fine and compensation amount.

[^23]: \[51\] of the Defence’s Closing Submissions. It was the evidence of the Investigations Officer Matthias Aw (PW6) (“IO”) that from the time when the Complainant parked her car, when the car was switched from driving mode to parking mode, there was a “jump” in the video footage whereby there was a gap of about 44 seconds during which there were no footages recorded, from 10.00.29 am to 10.01.13 a.m. The IO reasoned that the “jump” could be due to the driving mode of the car being switched to parking mode from driving mode when the Complainant drove and parked the car.
