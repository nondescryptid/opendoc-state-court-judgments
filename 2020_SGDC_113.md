### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Michael Frank Hartung (“Accused”), claimed trial to two charges of distributing information that is intended to promote conduct of commercial sex with minors under 18 outside Singapore under s 376D(1)(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) punishable under s 376D(3) of the Penal Code. The charges are reproduced below:

> **DAC 906127/2017 (“C1A”)**

> “…that \[the Accused\], on the 26th day of September 2015 at about 3.30 pm, at ‘Starbucks Coffee’ café located at Raffles City shopping Centre, Singapore, did distribute information that is intended to promote conduct of commercial sex with minors under 18 outside Singapore, to wit, by meeting with two Singapore Citizens, one ‘Jackson Fong’ and one ‘Michael’ and distributing information concerning the procurement of commercial sex with girls under the age of 18 in the Republic of the Philippines to the said ‘Jackson Fong’ and ‘Michael’, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 376D(1)(c) and punishable under Section 376D(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

> **DAC 906128/2017 (“C2A”)**

> “…that \[the Accused\], on the 15th day of April 2016 at about 7.45 pm, at ‘XI&O’ pub located at No 110 Mackenzie Road, Singapore, did distribute information that is intended to promote conduct of commercial sex with minors under 18 outside Singapore, to wit, by meeting with two Singapore Permanent Residents, one ‘Frank’ and one ‘Paul’, and distributing information concerning the procurement of commercial sex with girls under the age of 18 in the Republic of the Philippines to the said ‘Frank’ and ‘Paul’ and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 376D(1)(c) and punishable under Section 376D(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on both proceeded charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on both charges.

3       After reviewing the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I imposed the following individual sentences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.78%"> <col width="38.24%"> <col width="48.98%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C1A</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">36 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C2A</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">30 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

4       The sentences of imprisonment in both charges were ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence was therefore 66 months' imprisonment.

5       The Accused was dissatisfied with the conviction and sentences. He has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. On 6 September 2019, I granted a stay of execution on the sentence of imprisonment. Bail pending appeal was set at $60,000. However, as the Accused could not find a surety to bail him, he commenced serving the sentence on 6 September 2019.

6       I shall now set out my grounds of decision.

## Background to the Police’s Operations against the Accused

### The First Operation

7       The Police received information that the Accused was organising sex tours with minors outside Singapore. The Police then mounted two operations against the Accused. Each operation consisted of online communications with the Accused and a face-to-face meeting between the Accused and undercover police officers.

8       The first operation started around 3 June 2015. The undercover police officers involved in this operation were PW6 and PW8[^1]. On 3 June 2015, PW8, using the account XXX contacted the Accused at his account, XXX over Yahoo Online Messenger[^2]. Arising from the series of exchanges on Yahoo Online Messenger, the Accused met PW6 and PW8 on 26 September 2015 at Starbucks Coffee café in Raffles City Shopping Centre[^3] (“the September 2015 Meeting”). PW6 and PW8 are undercover police officers. The first operation ended around 27 October 2015[^4].

9       At the end of the first operation, the Police’s concerns about the Accused’s intention remained. PW8 obtained authorisation from PW6 to the second operation against the Accused.

### The Second Operation

10     The second operation started around 20 January 2016. The undercover police officers involved in this operation were PW8, PW9 and PW10[^5]. On 20 January 2016, PW8 using the account “Darkthrone” communicated with the Accused at his username “Lord Protector” on a forum called Darkfetish.net, which is a forum for people with interests in Bondage, Domination and Sadomasochism (BDSM)[^6]. The Accused and PW8 subsequently communicated on another platform called Wickr. Arising from the series of exchanges on Darkfetish.net and Wickr, the Accused met PW9 and PW10 on 15 April 2016 at the ‘XI&O’ pub located at No. 110 Mackenzie Road[^7] (“the April 2016 Meeting”). The second operation ended shortly after the April 2016 Meeting. Nonetheless, investigations against the Accused continued.

11     After the conclusion of the second operation, the Police assessed their case against the Accused. The Police then proceeded to conduct a raid at the Accused’s house on 30 August 2016 wherein the Accused was placed under arrest. The Police seized the Accused’s laptop (Exhibit P4) and other exhibits for further investigations.

12     Based on the evidence gathered from the two operations and from their investigations, the Police produced the Accused in court to face the aforementioned two charges (_i.e._ C1A and C2A).[^8]

## Case for the Prosecution

### Summary of the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses

13     To prove its case against the Accused, the Prosecution called ten witnesses. In the table below, I have summarised the respective witnesses’ evidence.

14     The evidence of PW1 to PW5, and PW7, are formal in nature as described in the table above. The salient parts of the other four witnesses’ evidence, who went undercover to meet the Accused in two different settings, are set out at paragraphs \[25\] to \[48\] below.

### Admissibility of Electronic Records and Ambit of Re-examination

15     A significant part of the Prosecution’s case was based on electronic records. Hence, I would digress at this stage to deal with two issues related to the admissibility of evidence before I delve further into the evidence of Prosecution’s material witnesses, the defence’s case, and the assessment of the evidence.

#### Admissibility of Electronic Records

16     During the evidence-in-chief of PW1, the Prosecution sought to admit into evidence a set of printout downloaded from Darkfetish.net. This was the chat logs between PW8 (masquerading as “Darkthrone”) and the Accused (using “Lord Protector”) (see Exhibit P9). The Defence objected to the admission of Exhibit P9. The Defence submitted that PW1 is not the author of these chat logs. According to the Defence, it is necessary for there to be witnesses _i.e._ the maker/producer behind Darkfetish.net, to testify regarding the production of these documents as contemplated in s 116A of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”). The Defence submitted that electronic records must be properly proved if it is to constitute primary evidence. The Prosecution argued that requiring the beneficiary of a presumption (i.e. the Prosecution in this case) to prove the presumption would be contrary to the plain meaning of s 116A EA. According to the Prosecution, it is clear that the presumption under s 116A EA applies in this case – having regard to the illustrations in the provision. Further, the Prosecution submitted that the chat logs were admissible because they were relevant to show the Accused’s motive and the occasion, cause or effect of the facts in issue. In support of this submission, the Prosecution cited ss 7 and 8 EA.

17     I ruled that the Darkfetish.net chat logs (Exhibit P9) was admissible. Firstly, I found that the chat logs were relevant evidence falling within one or more sections of ss 5 to 8 EA, in particular, s 8 EA. Secondly, there are applicable presumptions under s 116A(1) and s 116A(2) EA. The Defence has failed to adduce evidence sufficient to rebut the presumptions. In applying s 116A EA, I was guided by the illustration at s 116A(2):

> **_A_** \[the Prosecution\] seeks to adduce evidence against **_B_** \[the Accused\] in the form of an electronic record \[Exhibit P9\]. The fact that the electronic record was generated, recorded or stored in the usual and ordinary course of business by **_C_** \[content owner of Darkfetish.net\], a neutral third party, is a relevant fact for the court to presume that the electronic record is authentic.

> (Insertion in parenthesis are mine).

18     I was fortified in my ruling for subsequently when the Accused gave his defence, he did not deny being the person behind “Lord Protector” in the chat logs from Darkfetish.net (_i.e._ Exhibits P9, P10 and D2 to D6).

19     My reasons for the admission of Exhibit P9 are equally applicable to other electronic records (e.g. Exhibits P10, P13 to P16, P21, P22, D2 to D6, D14, D15, etc.) adduced by both parties.

#### Ambit of Re-examination

20     During the cross-examination of PW1, PW1 has testified that there was no evidence suggesting the Accused’s involvement in child exploitation.[^9] At re-examination of PW1, the Prosecution sought to admit Exhibit P12 as its response to this aspect of PW1’s evidence. Exhibit P12 is an acknowledgment slip given by PW1 to the Accused listing the devices seized from the Accused’s residence. The data uncovered from the devices seized included chat logs (Yahoo Online Messenger, Skype Messenger and Darkfetish.net[^10]) and photographs of naked young girls, which were suggestive that the Accused was involved in child sex exploitation.[^11] In particular, Exhibit P13 is a chat log between the Accused and one “maemae natividad” wherein the Accused has propositioned “maemae natividad” for extreme sex with no limits and they could have threesome with other girls including her sisters.[^12] Exhibit P14 contained photographs of a young girl in various poses, presumably that of one “XXX”. Exhibit P15 contained photographs of naked minor girls. Exhibit P16 is a chat log between the Accused and one “purity ngaia” discussing the purchase of young girls for commercial sex.

21     The Defence objected to the admission of Exhibits P12 to P16. The Defence submitted that these exhibits were not relevant to the Accused’s charges, and that producing fresh evidence during re-examination was not permissible. The Prosecution submitted that Exhibits P12 to P16 were a response to a matter raised by the Defence during cross-examination, and that the principle of re-examination allows the production of fresh evidence where it is a response to issues raised during cross-examination.

22     After reviewing the relevant literature on this topic, I ruled that Exhibits P12 to P16 were admissible and overruled the Defence’s objection. The governing provision addressing the scope of re-examination is s 140(3) EA, which states:

> (3)    Re-examination shall be directed to the explanation of the matters referred to in cross-examination, and if new matter is, by permission of the court, introduced in re-examination, the adverse party may further cross-examine upon that matter.

23     While there is no judicial authority from Singapore which interprets this provision, guidance can be gleaned from the commentaries in local textbooks on the law of evidence. It is trite that re-examination allows a party to allay the adverse effect of cross-examination on a particular matter by eliciting additional or peripheral facts so that a particular matter can be viewed in a wider context than that provided in cross-examination: Jeffrey Pinsler, _Evidence and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 4th Edn, 2013) at p 869 (See Exhibit F). Re-examination provides an opportunity to reconcile the discrepancy between statements in examination-in-chief and cross-examination, or to explain any statement inadvertently made in cross-examination, or to remove any ambiguity or suspicion cast on evidence by cross-examination: Sarkar et al, _Sarkar’s Law of Evidence_ (Wadhwa & Co, 24th Edn, 2011) at p 827 (See Exhibit H).

24     During cross-examination of PW1, I observed that the Defence had raised issues of child exploitation and human trafficking[^13] and therefore did not restrict its scope of cross-examination to the proceeded charges against the Accused (_i.e._ distribution of information concerning the procurement of commercial sex with minors in the Republic of Philippines). Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution was entitled to re-examine PW1: to ask relevant questions and to introduce relevant materials such as Exhibits P13 to P16 in response to the aforementioned issues raised by the Defence in cross-examination.

### Evidence of PW6, PW8, PW9 and PW10

#### PW6 alias ‘Michael’ – Undercover police officer

25     In relation to the charge C1A, PW6 testified that police investigations revealed that the Accused had a Yahoo email account, ‘XXX.[^14] Accordingly, PW8 created a Yahoo email account, ‘XXX.[^15] PW8 communicated with the Accused via Yahoo Online Messenger starting from 3 June 2015 to October 2015. PW8 would periodically update PW6 on his progress by providing PW6 with the Yahoo chat logs.[^16]

26     PW8 informed PW6 that the Accused agreed to meet to discuss details of the overseas child sex tour.[^17] PW6 agreed to accompany PW8 for the meeting.

27     At the September 2015 Meeting, PW8 introduced himself as ‘Jackson’ and PW6 as ‘Michael’. PW8 informed the Accused of their interest to look for young girls in the Philippines.[^18] When PW8 shared his fear of potential repercussions if PW6 and PW8 were to go to the Philippines without experience in looking for young girls in the Philippines[^19], the Accused told them: _“you need to have certain information, otherwise, many things may happen.”_[^20] PW6 testified that the Accused informed them that the Philippines is not a reliable country and therefore they needed _“relation\[s\] or connection\[s\]”_ with the people or organisation there.[^21]

28     When the Accused asked about their intended date of travel to the Philippines, PW6 and PW8 gave the dates of 15 to 18 October 2015.[^22] PW6 testified that the Accused asked them how many girls they wanted, to which they replied that they wanted one girl for each of them, each night.[^23] PW6 testified that the Accused followed up by mentioning that: (a) he would ask his friend to make the arrangements for them; (b) that he would arrange for PW6 and PW8 to go to Manila, Philippines, for the trip; and (c) that he would go to Philippines two days prior to PW6 and PW8’s arrival _“to make sure everything is okay.”_[^24]

29     The Accused stated that he would arrange for six virgin girls who were aged between 14 and 16 years old.[^25] PW6 testified that the Accused gave PW8 and himself the following information:

> (a)     The Accused would either pick PW6 and PW8 up from the airport, or PW6 and PW8 could take a taxi from the airport to the hotel arranged by the Accused, on the day of the arrival.[^26]

> (b)     PW6 and PW8 should stay in a hotel in the city as it is _“safer_._”_[^27]

> (c)     The Accused highlighted a small problem of staying in a hotel in the city – bringing young girls into the hotel may attract unnecessary attention and suspicion to the hotel security.[^28] The Accused provided PW6 and PW8 with a solution to minimise suspicion – the Accused would book two rooms, one under either PW6 or PW8’s name, and the other room in the girl’s name.[^29]

> (d)     PW6 and PW8 are discouraged from staying in an apartment or house, because those would be located in the countryside, which _“may not be that safe”_ and further, PW6 and PW8 may not be able to move around, and there would be limited amenities such as shopping.[^30]

> (e)     The Accused would book the hotel for PW6 and PW8, and once the Accused obtained the hotel confirmation, PW6 and PW8 were to pay the Accused 20% of the hotel charges. The remaining 80% would need to be paid upon arrival in Philippines.[^31]

> (f)     PW6 and PW8 were to buy their own air tickets.[^32]

30     PW6 also testified that PW8 continued to interact with the Accused via Yahoo Messenger after the September 2015 Meeting.[^33] PW6 testified that on 5 October 2015, the Accused informed PW8 that _“his partner”_ was overseas and was unable to deliver.[^34] The Accused mentioned that he needed to postpone the trip.[^35] PW6 testified that thereafter, there was no news from the Accused.[^36]

31     In relation to charge C2A, PW6 testified that investigations revealed that the Accused maintained an account in Darkfetish.net[^37], with the username ‘Lord Protector.’[^38] This led to the second operation against the Accused. PW8 created an account in Darkfetish.net using the username ‘Dark Throne’ and used this account to interact and communicate with the Accused via the messaging system in the portal.[^39] Subsequently, PW8 communicated with the Accused on another online chat portal, ‘Wickr.’[^40] PW8 would periodically update PW6 on the second operation.[^41]

32     PW6 testified that the Accused agreed to meet up at the ‘XI&O’ pub located at 110 Mackenzie Road.[^42] PW6 was aware that PW8 had recruited PW9 and PW10 for the meeting with the Accused. [^43]

#### PW8 alias ‘Jackson’ – Undercover police officer

33     In relation to the charge C1A, PW8 testified that investigation revealed that the Accused was using a Yahoo email account.[^44] He then created a Yahoo account, ‘XXX on 3 June 2015.[^45] After adding the Accused (at his account ‘XXX) as a friend, PW8 started a conversation with the Accused through Yahoo Messenger.[^46] In the conversation, PW8 asked the Accused whether the latter could organise a sex tour with minors in Thailand or Cambodia, and told the Accused that he was looking at the ages of 15 or 16.[^47] PW8 conveyed his request for virgin girls aged 15 or 16[^48], for at least three girls for 3 nights of the tour[^49], and for the girls to stay overnight in their hotel rooms.[^50] PW8 said that he did not mind the tour being in Thailand, Cambodia or Philippines.[^51] PW8 had also told the Accused that he was from Singapore.[^52] The Accused told PW8 that he could arrange a 3-day tour in Cebu for S$1,500 inclusive of a travel guide and companion.[^53] The Accused told PW8 that he would meet PW8 later to discuss in detail.[^54]

34     PW8 testified that he met the Accused with PW6 at the September 2015 Meeting.[^55] PW8 and PW6 told the Accused that: (a) they wanted young girls aged around 14 and 16 who were preferably virgins[^56]; (b) the tour dates would be 15 to 18 October 2015[^57]; and (c) only two persons would be going for the tour[^58]. PW8 told the Accused to make the arrangements and that money was not an issue so long as they got the girls they wanted.[^59] PW8 testified that the Accused told PW6 and him the following:

> (a)     The Accused would talk to his friend to arrange, and that the tour would be in Manila.[^60]

> (b)     The Accused would be there two days in advance to make sure the tour was planned and that the arrangements of the girls were in place.[^61]

> (c)     Upon arrival of PW8 and PW6 at the airport, the Accused would either receive them or direct them to take a taxi to meet him at the hotel.[^62]

> (d)     The Accused would arrange a 5-star hotel in the city because a 5-star hotel is safer[^63], and there is shopping near the city unlike in the countryside – which is unsafe and has no shopping area.[^64]

> (e)     The Accused would book two rooms – one room would be for PW6 and PW8, and the other room would be for the young girls. The Accused informed them of this arrangement because if the girls go directly to PW6 and PW8’s room, it would arouse the suspicion of hotel staff.[^65]

> (f)     Once accommodation is booked, PW6 and PW8 would have to pay 20% of S$1,500, and the balance of 80% is to be paid upon arrival to the Philippines.[^66]

> (g)     Air tickets were to be arranged by PW6 and PW8 themselves.[^67]

35     PW8 testified that the Accused said that he would try to meet the requests for specific characteristics, which PW8 sought.[^68]

36     In relation to the charge C2A, PW8 testified that he traced the Accused’s profile on Darkfetish.net by inputting the Accused’s email account ‘XXX into Darkfetish.net.[^69] PW8 testified that he engaged in conversations with the Accused on Darkfetish.net, where he used the name of ‘Darkthrone’ and the Accused used the name ‘Lord Protector’.[^70] These conversations were admitted as Exhibit P9. In particular, the Accused asked PW8 if he was interested in “_common and sharef \[sic\] projects_.” [^71] PW8 informed the Accused that he wanted to “_try young blood in asia._”[^72] In response, the Accused stated: _“\[d\]efinetely \[sic\] we can share ideas and try young blood.”_[^73] The Accused suggested that it was harder to find _“young blood”_ in Singapore, and that it was _“much easier”_ in Cambodia and Philippines.[^74] PW8 apprised the Accused of his preferences, including that he _“like\[d\] young blood \[aged\] between 14 and 18”_.[^75] PW8 then asked for the Accused’s advice in procuring “young blood” in Cambodia and Philippines.[^76] The Accused invited PW8 to meet for coffee and to _“share some ideas and tipps \[sic\].”_[^77] PW8 communicated that he is a Singapore Permanent Resident to the Accused.[^78] Thereafter, PW8 communicated with the Accused on Wickr, where the Accused’s Wickr ID is ‘Hartmic75.’

37     PW8 testified that the Accused agreed to meet him at ‘XI&O’ pub at 110 Mackenzie Road. However, since PW8 represented himself to the Accused as an expatriate who was a permanent resident in Singapore, he enlisted the help of PW9 and PW10.[^79] PW8 briefed PW9 and PW10, both of whom agreed to meet, and actually met the Accused on 15 April 2016 at the ‘XI&O’ pub.

38     For the meeting at the ‘XI&O’ pub, PW8 had equipped PW9 and PW10 each with an audio recording device to record the conversation at the meeting[^80] although it later transpired that only PW9’s recorder successfully recorded the conversation.[^81] The recording of the meeting from PW9’s recorder was extracted and transcribed. The transcript was tendered in Court as Exhibit P5.[^82] The device held by PW10 ran out of battery even before the Accused’s arrival.[^83] PW8 had also equipped PW9 and PW10 with two phones – the screen-shots obtained from one of these phones are that observed in Exhibit P25.[^84]

#### PW9 alias ‘Frank’ – Undercover police officer

39     PW9 testified that sometime in end March 2016, PW8 approached him by phone and asked if he was interested in being involved in the undercover operations.[^85] During meetings between PW9, PW10, and PW8, PW8 briefed the two officers of the details of the operation and the offences PW8 suspected the Accused was involved in. PW8 showed PW9 and PW10 the chat logs from Darkfetish.net.[^86] PW9 and PW10 were informed of the Accused’s name and were shown his photograph.[^87] When PW8 communicated to PW9 that a meeting with the Accused had been planned, PW9 agreed to participate in the meeting.

40     Two days prior to the meeting with the Accused, PW8 briefed PW9 and PW10 and confirmed the location of the meeting – i.e. the ‘XI&O’ pub[^88]. At this briefing, PW8 supplied PW9 with a USB recording device (Exhibit P6) and two iPhones – one of the iPhones contained the Wickr application where PW8 communicated with the Accused.[^89]

41     On 15 April 2016, around 7.45 pm, PW9 and PW10 met the Accused outside ‘XI&O’ pub.[^90] As PW9 and PW10 proceeded to ‘XI&O’ pub, PW9 switched on the recording device given to him by PW8 and placed it into his shirt pocket.[^91] PW9 introduced himself as ‘Frank’.[^92] PW10 introduced himself as ‘Paul’.[^93] The Accused introduced himself as ‘Mike’.[^94] The Accused started by telling PW9 and PW10 that there were two possible countries that they could consider for the sex tour[^95] - Philippines and Cambodia.[^96] PW9 testified that the Accused gave them the following information:

> (a)     Philippines would be a safer option and Cambodia was possibly more dangerous.[^97]

> (b)     People in the Philippines were basically poor and it was more about business than anything else. It was really a commercial transaction.[^98]

> (c)     There were two possible locations within the Philippines – Manila and Cebu. Manila would be a nicer and better location for them.[^99]

> (d)     They should choose to stay in an international hotel in the bay area, which PW9 testified, should be referring to Makati.[^100]

> (e)     There were two potential hotel options – Shangri-La and Pan Pacific, which were international hotels.[^101]

> (f)     An international hotel was less likely to arouse suspicion.[^102] The Accused advised against going to smaller hotels as they would likely have a doorman, and a westerner with a young underage Asian female would stand out much more, and the doorman would ask questions before allowing entry.[^103]

> (g)     International hotels would offer multiple key cards for a room, and accordingly it would be easier to provide a key to an underage female to get into a room[^104] – as opposed to a small hotel, which would likely have a physical metal key.[^105]

> (h)     They should book two rooms – one room would be for themselves, and the other room would be for the adult female and the underage girl.[^106]

> (i)     The girls would come from the provinces by bus and would arrive in Manila at an arranged location, with the underage girl being accompanied by an adult female, who could possibly be a relative.[^107] The purpose of the Asian adult would be so that it would not arouse the same suspicion that an Asian underage female with an adult westerner would.[^108]

> (j)     Upon arrival of the girls, they were expected to provide them with food, which could be fast food such as Jollibee fried chicken.[^109]

> (k)     They should be prepared to accept that there could be delays along the way.[^110]

> (l)     Once PW9 and PW10 specified an age range, the Accused would approach a middleman who would go to the villages to try to meet the specifications.[^111] The middleman would approach families of people to see if there was an appropriately aged female.[^112]

> (m)     There could be disappointments in the early days, but it gets easier over time, and that paying the middleman money also makes it easier.[^113]

> (n)     The cost of the endeavour was 10,000 pesos (approximately S$300) – 9,000 pesos would go to the adult female, and 1,000 pesos would go to the underage girl.[^114] The Accused shared that the price of 10,000 pesos is considered overpriced and that such a price was an overcharge.[^115]

42     PW9 testified that the Accused informed that the minors fell into two age brackets – one was 6 to 12 years old, and the other was 13 to 17 years old.[^116] The Accused said that girls of the 6 to 12 year old age bracket would be easier to supply, and that girls of the 13 to 17 year old age bracket would be harder – if the girls were having school examinations, it was potentially harder to procure the girls.[^117]

43     PW9 testified that sometime before parties wrapped up the conversation at the April 2016 Meeting[^118], the Accused asked PW9 and PW10 how many girls they would like to have, to which PW9 and PW10 responded that they would initially try one girl.[^119] The Accused told PW9 and PW10 that it could take three weeks to organise the tour.[^120]

#### PW10 alias ‘Paul’ – Undercover police officer

44     PW10 testified that on or around March 2016, he was contacted by PW8. PW8 invited him to participate in an undercover operation.[^121] PW10 informed PW8 that he was willing to meet and discuss with him, and subsequently he became part of the operation.[^122] PW10 testified that during the meetings between PW8, PW9 and himself, PW8 told them the Accused’s name and they were shown a photograph of the Accused.[^123] PW8 also showed PW9 and PW10 chat logs on Darkfetish.net with the Accused which occurred prior to the operation.[^124] During a briefing by PW8 to PW9 and PW10 that was held two days prior to meeting the Accused, PW8 gave PW9 and PW10 each an audio recording device to record the conversations at the meeting.[^125] PW9 was given two mobile phones. PW9 and PW10 then attended the April 2016 Meeting.

45     At the April 2016 Meeting, PW10 placed the audio recording device given to him by PW8, which was in the shape of a car key, on the table.[^126] The device had been switched on from the time before PW10 entered the pub.[^127] PW10 testified that after introductions at the meeting, PW10 directed the conversation to the communication with PW9 via mobile phones and chat logs.[^128]

46     PW10 testified that the Accused then provided them with the following information:

> (a)     There were two possible countries to go – Philippines or Cambodia.[^129] The Accused said that Philippines would be “safer”[^130], and that specifically in the Philippines, they should go to Manila.[^131]

> (b)     It was safer to have the tour in a city area than a remote area, as a city area was more reliable.[^132]

> (c)     The hotel options could be large international hotels such as Shangri-La in Makati, or smaller hotels.[^133] However, the Accused said that an international hotel was more suitable for what they had in mind, since international hotels use key cards which would facilitate easy entry and access. In comparison, they would stand out more in smaller hotels[^134].

> (d)     The Accused also said that it was strange for someone to enter a hotel with a 12 or 13 year old girl, but that international hotels do not care or do not seem to care and accordingly, it would not be a problem.[^135] In contrast, in smaller hotels, there was often a doorman who would take notice and be familiar with who goes in and out, and may query about what was happening and cause problems.[^136]

> (e)     The girls would come by bus to Manila[^137] from more remote areas of the Philippines.[^138] The girls were often accompanied by an adult female chaperone who was usually a cousin, family member, or a friend.[^139]

> (f)     They could provide a meal, such as from Jollibee, to the girls.[^140]

> (g)     The girl with the adult female chaperone would check in a separate room from PW9 and PW10, though possibly adjoining rooms for easy connection.[^141]

> (h)     The Accused has connections to find girls – he has a middleman who would go outside of Manila, and would ask around to see if there was such a girl available to come to Manila for such purpose.[^142]

> (i)     They could give indications, though not too specific, of the ages of the girls, and the Accused would bring someone of those specifications to Manila.[^143] The Accused said _“it would be bad business if they did not provide somebody of a similar description.”_[^144]

> (j)     The Accused shared his experience of being disappointed on previous occasions where no one showed up or he was overcharged.[^145]

> (k)     The cost of the tour would be about 10,000 pesos (about S$300) – 9,000 pesos paid to the adult chaperone and 1,000 pesos being paid to the girl.[^146] The Accused commented that such a price was actually an overcharge – a common amount was 5,000 pesos.[^147]

> (l)     The Accused would assist with hotel bookings, and arranging taxi from the airport to the hotels and other transport if necessary.[^148]

> (m)     It would take at least two to three weeks for the Accused to make arrangements[^149].

47     PW10 testified that the Accused asked him the age range of the girls PW9 and PW10 were interested in, and the number of girls they wanted.[^150] The Accused told them there were two age brackets – one being girls aged between 6 to 12 years old, and the other being girls aged between 13 to 17 years old.[^151] The Accused told them that there was an issue with the girls aged between 13 to 17 years old as they have examinations and if such examinations clashed with the tour dates, the girls would not be able to attend the tour.[^152]

48     PW10 informed the Accused of his preference for a girl up to 14 years old, while PW9 stated his preference of a girl up to 15 or 16 years old.[^153] The Accused then asked PW9 and PW10 how many girls they wanted, to which they responded that they would have one girl each.[^154] The Accused then informed PW9 and PW10 that he would make some inquiries, talk to his contacts in both Manila and Cebu.[^155] PW10 offered the Accused payment of a deposit, though the Accused rejected the payment and said that it was not necessary since he would only be making reservations[^156], and conveyed that it was not something he did as a business but that he was merely helping people with like-minded interests.[^157]

## Close of the Prosecution’s Case

49     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, counsel for the Accused made a submission of no case to answer. I did not agree with his submission. I was satisfied that there was some evidence not inherently incredible which satisfies each and every element of offences in charges C1A and C2A. Accordingly, I called on the Accused to give his defence to both charges.

## Case for the Defence

### Outline of the Defence’s Case

50     The Accused was the sole witness for the defence.

51     The Accused denied all elements of the charges under s 376D(1)(c). According to the Defence, he did not engage in any conduct that amounts to distribution of information for commercial sex with minors outside of Singapore under s 376D(1)(c) of the Penal Code. The Accused denied providing such information, and indicated that there was no intention on his part to distribute such information.

52     The Accused’s defence was that he had merely responded to PW6, PW8, PW9 and PW10’s queries. He did not initiate discussions or volunteer any information about having sex with minors in the Philippines or elsewhere. He did not solicit customers for such purposes. The Accused claimed that he was merely “playing along” in his chats on Yahoo Online Messenger (Exhibit P22) and with the witnesses at both meetings. The Accused claimed that he was incited and instigated into providing information relating to commercial sex with minors in the Philippines.

53     Another plank of the Accused’s defence was that the information he had given constitutes general information in the public domain. The Accused came to know of such information because he had worked in the Philippines and is familiar with the sexual services industry in the Philippines. Furthermore, the Defence submitted that the references to Manila and Cebu made by the Accused are extremely general and would not assist a like-minded person to further the mischief of enhancing demand for commercial sex with minors outside Singapore. The Accused took the position that the chat logs on Skype messenger between the Accused and one “XXX” (Exhibit P21) were incomplete, doctored or tampered by the police.

54     Finally, the Accused suggested that he had no intention to distribute information to promote commercial sex with minors in the Philippines. The Accused was motivated to attend the meetings on the September 2015 and April 2016 Meetings due to his legitimate business interests in ERASIG LLP. Further, the Accused was non-responsive in his communications with “XXX” on Yahoo Online Messenger (Exhibit P22) because he was not interested in distributing information relating to commercial sex with minors in the Philippines. The Accused even stopped communications after both meetings, thereby illustrating that he had no intention in distributing information relating to commercial sex with minors outside Singapore.

### The Accused’s Evidence

55     The Accused testified that he was a partner in ERASIG LLP[^158] (the “Company”), which was formally set up in 2014.[^159] However, even prior to the Company being set up, the Company had been engaging in the business of organising tours to Russians who visited Asia[^160], as well as in the areas of training and business consultancy.[^161] The Accused engaged in activities of the Company part-time from 2011 onwards, when he was still employed with Deutsche Bank, and continued such activities full-time when his employment in Deutsche Bank was terminated.[^162] The Accused testified that the tours organised by the Company include tours to the Philippines[^163] – specifically, the bay area in Manila[^164], and to Cebu.[^165]

56     The Accused testified that in his position in Deutsche Bank, he was in charge of outsourcing business activities from Singapore to Manila. Accordingly, the Accused travelled between four to six times a year to the Philippines, for about two weeks usually, to train people there and to coordinate business activities.[^166] The Accused testified that he mainly stayed in Shangri-La in Makati, and one or two times in other hotels and in Pan Pacific in the bay area.[^167]

57     The Accused testified that he was not interested in the conversation with XXX on Yahoo Online Messenger (Exhibit P22) and that he was merely playing along just to give XXX answers. Similarly, he stated that he was playing along with PW9 and PW10 when cross-examined on the April 2016 Meeting. The Accused further testified that he had mirrored and repeated what PW8 said in the Darkfetish.net chat logs in order to build rapport and connection with PW8.[^168]

## Applicable Legal Principles

58     The gravamen of a charge under s 376D(1)(c) of the Penal Code, as set out by the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _Chan Chun Hong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 465</span> (“_Chan Chun Hong”_) at \[128\] are as follows:

> (a)     Print, publish or distribute information; and

> (b)     That information is intended to promote conduct that would constitute an offence under s 376C or assist in the engagement of such conduct.

## Issues to be Determined

59     In essence, there were five issues to be considered:

> (a)     Whether the Accused distributed information to the undercover police officers in the September 2015 and April 2016 Meetings, and if so, what information was distributed;

> (b)     In relation to the main aspects of the Defence’s submissions:

>> (i)       Whether the Accused attended the meetings due to his legitimate commercial interest in ERASIG LLP;

>> (ii)       Whether the Accused’s alleged non-responsiveness illustrates his disinterest;

>> (iii)       The Accused’s reasons for terminating communication with the undercover police officers; and

>> (iv)       Whether the Accused merely played along with the undercover police officers.

### Issue 1: Distribution of Information by the Accused

60     First, I considered whether the Accused distributed information to the undercover police officers. I shall start with the charge C1A.

#### Distribution of Information in charge C1A

61     It is undisputed that the Accused (using the account ‘XXX) had communicated with PW8 (using the account ‘XXX) on Yahoo Online Messenger.

62     Having reviewed the testimonies of PW8, the Accused, and the documentary evidence in the form of Exhibit P22, I found:

> (a)     that the Accused had, prior to the September 2015 Meeting, conveyed to PW8 on the Yahoo Online Messenger that he (_i.e._ the Accused) could arrange a 3-day tour to Cebu for sex with minors aged 15 or 16 years old, for the amount of S$1,500 including a travel guide and companion[^169]; and

> (b)     that by the time the Accused attended the September 2015 Meeting, the Accused was well aware of PW8’s interest in commercial sex with minors outside Singapore~.~

63     At the outset, I considered the Accused’s replies in German within the first few message exchanges between the Accused and PW8 on Yahoo Online Messenger (Exhibit P22). When PW8 asked the Accused in English whether he helped organise tours specially for guys in Thailand or Cambodia, the Accused responded in English, _“Ok means you want get girls or guys?_. PW8 replied “_girls_”. The Accused then responded in his native German language: _“Ok wiviele wie lange und wie extreme?”_ Both PW10 and the Accused testified that this meant: _“how many, how long and how extreme?”_[^170] The use of German in his replies showed that the Accused understood the sexual context of the request made by PW8. The Accused then added, again in German, “_Und hast du budget? Alles ist moeglich.”_ Loosely translated, these two German sentences meant: “Do you have a budget? Everything is possible.” The use of German to ask for more details about the tour illustrates that the Accused knew what PW8 was asking of him. In response to the replies given by the Accused in German, PW8 replied: “_Sorry, I dun get you.”_ The Accused then proceeded to clarify: _“how many do you want and what type and for how long ?”_ and _“All is possible. With some details i can advise.”_

64     Further, PW8 was clear in conveying to the Accused that he (_i.e._ PW8) was _“new to overseas”_ and was looking to the latter to provide him with information on engaging in commercial sex with minors outside Singapore, including asking for suggestions on location, on the “_market rate_”, and the availability of virgin girls.[^171] I also found that PW8 had told the Accused that he was from Singapore.[^172]

65     Accordingly, this sets the context of the Accused’s knowledge in the subject of commercial sex with minors overseas in his discussions with PW8 on the Yahoo Online Messenger platform. These online discussions then led to the September 2015 Meeting.

66     The September 2015 Meeting was not disputed by the Accused. However, the Accused submitted that he had not distributed information to PW6 and PW8 relating to commercial sex with minors overseas. I rejected the Accused’s defence. Instead, I accepted the evidence of PW6 and PW8. I found their evidence to be consistent and were unshaken under cross-examination. I found that the Accused shared with PW6 and PW8 that they needed to have certain information to prevent _“many things”_ from happening[^173]. The Accused then proceeded to distribute the following information to PW6 and PW8 during the September 2015 Meeting:

> (a)     PW6 and PW8 needed someone with “relation” and “connection” in the Philippines because the Philippines was not a “reliable country.”[^174]

> (b)     The Accused would ask a friend to arrange for PW6 and PW8 to travel to Manila, in the Philippines, for commercial sex with minors.[^175]

> (c)     The Accused would arrange six virgin girls aged between 14 and 16 years old.[^176]

> (d)     The Accused would fly into Manila two days prior to PW6 and PW8’s intended date of arrival on 15 Oct 2015 to make sure that everything was in order.[^177]

> (e)     The Accused would either pick up PW6 and PW8 at the airport in Manila, or that PW6 and PW8 could take a taxi to the hotel the Accused booked.[^178]

> (f)     They should stay in a hotel in the city because it is safer than one located in the countryside. The Accused shared that PW6 and PW8 may not be able to move around if they opted for a hotel in the countryside, and that limited amenities such as shopping were available in the countryside.[^179]

> (g)     It was difficult to bring girls directly to hotels in the city because it would arouse suspicion of the hotel security.[^180] To minimise suspicion, PW6 and PW8 could book two rooms – one for PW6 and PW8 in either of their names, and the other room for the girls under one of the girl’s name.[^181]

> (h)     The Accused could assist with hotel booking. Upon confirmation of the booking, PW6 and PW8 could pay 20% of the hotel charges first. The remaining 80% could be paid when they met the Accused in the Philippines[^182].

> (i)     PW6 and PW8 should purchase their own air tickets[^183].

67     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the September 2015 Meeting was specifically for the Accused to share his plans with PW6 and PW8 pursuant to the request made by PW8 during the online discussion on Yahoo Online Messenger.

68     I found that the information provided by the Accused during the September 2015 Meeting was intended to promote the conduct of commercial sex with minors outside Singapore.

69     I shall now proceed with my assessment of the evidence in relation to charge C2A.

#### Distribution of Information in charge C2A

70     Having reviewed the evidence of PW8 and the Accused, as well as Exhibit P9, I found that the Accused had, prior to the April 2016 Meeting, conveyed the following information to Darkthrone (_i.e_. PW8 acting undercover), on Darkfetish.net:

> (a)     Darkthrone and the Accused could _“share ideas and try young blood_.”[^184] Darkthrone had informed the Accused that he liked young blood aged _“between 14 and 18.”_[^185]

> (b)     It was hard to engage in commercial sex with minors in Singapore, and that it was _“much easier”_ in Philippines and Cambodia.[^186]

> (c)     The Accused could arrange a tour in Asia for Darkthrone to try young blood.[^187]

> (d)     When Darkthrone asked if the Accused had _“pthc photos to share”_, the Accused responded that it was _“not really possible”_ and suggested _“little trace as possible.[^188]”_ PTHC is an abbreviation for Pre-Teen Hard Core, which refers to young children being sexually exploited online.[^189]

71     From the above evidence, it was clear to me that the Accused knew (by the time he attended the April 2016 Meeting) of Darkthrone’s interest in commercial sex with minors outside Singapore

72     It was clear in my mind that the Accused did not know of the actual identity of Darkthrone (the online username of PW8) during the online discussion on Darkfetish.net. In my assessment of the evidence, the Accused was not bothered by this lack of details. The Accused did not take any step, whether in the online discussion or at the April 2016 Meeting, to ascertain the real identity of Darkthrone. It was also clear to me that when PW9 and PW10 met up with the Accused at the ‘XI&O’ pub, the Accused had assumed either PW9 or PW10 to be Darkthrone. After the introductory exchanges and pleasantries, the Accused stated _“Philippines is good for_ **_your_** _case_. _So I work there. … it’s ok to arrange also, especially from the provinces. As usual people are poor, money a lot of things goes. It’s more commercial. Yah, it is just about money. Cambodia is also a possibility but it’s really, a bit more difficult so._” (see Exhibit P24)[^190] The use of the word “_your_” by the Accused showed clearly that he was making reference to the discussions on Darkfetish.net he had with Darkthrone. I found that the Accused knew that he was at the said meeting to follow-up on the discussions that had taken place on Darkfetish.net.

73     In respect of the April 2016 Meeting, I accepted the evidence of PW9 and PW10. I found their testimonies to be consistent and unshaken under cross-examination. Their testimonies were strongly corroborated by the amended transcript in Exhibit P24. From the testimonies of PW9 and PW10, I found that the Accused had distributed to PW9 and PW10 the following information at the said meeting:

> (a)     There were two possible destinations to engage in commercial sex with minor – _i.e._ Philippines and Cambodia[^191]. The Accused stated that Philippines would be a safer option and Cambodia was possibly more dangerous.[^192] The Accused informed them that people in the Philippines were poor, and accordingly, sex with minors was _“more commercial”_ and _“it is just about money”._[^193]

> (b)     Staying in an international hotel in the bay area[^194], either ‘Shangri La’[^195] or ‘Pan Pacific’[^196], was safer than staying in a smaller hotel which is _“dangerous”.[^197]_ The Accused shared that in a smaller hotel, PW9 and PW10 would attract unnecessary attention.[^198] The Accused shared that in smaller hotels, they may be issued with a single physical metal key instead of multiple hotel key cards.[^199] The Accused suggested a solution – he advised PW9 and PW10 to book two rooms, one for the adult female and underage girls, and the other room for themselves.[^200]

> (c)     There were potential difficulties of procuring minors within the 13 to 17 age bracket for sexual services if these minors were schooling were undertaking school examinations. The Accused advised that it was easier to procure girls in the age range of 6 to 12 years old during such periods.[^201] The Accused further informed that the age of the minors _“can go down to 6.” [^202]_

> (d)     It would take three weeks to procure the girls and organise the tour[^203]. The Accused informed them that the girls would commute by bus to Manila and the journey might face some delays due to traffic.[^204] The Accused informed that that these girls would be accompanied by an adult female (possibly a cousin or friend).[^205] The Accused further informed PW9 and PW10 that they were expected to provide the girls with some food such as a meal from Jollibee.[^206]

> (e)     Once PW9 and PW10 gave the Accused their specifications for young girls, he would approach a middleman who would go to the provinces and approach families, to find girls who met the requested specifications.[^207]

> (f)     One may encounter “_a lot of disappointment_” in the beginning[^208], but that the process would get easier over time[^209] as _“it takes time… to develop”._[^210]

> (g)     The price for procuring a single minor for sex in the Philippines costs around 10,000 pesos (approximately S$300)[^211] – 9,000 pesos would be paid to the adult female chaperone, and the remaining 1,000 pesos paid to the minor.[^212] The Accused opined that the price of 10,000 pesos was overpriced and that they were being overcharged if such a price was quoted.[^213] The Accused indicated that the “normal” price of procuring sexual services from a minor in the Philippines could be 5,000 pesos.[^214]

> (h)     PW9 and PW10 would have to inform the Accused of the age ranges of minors that they preferred. The Accused shared that the middleman are _“mostly quite reliable”_ because they know that there would be _“no deal”_ if the expectations were not met.[^215] The Accused suggested that PW9 and PW10 could specify the age range of minors such as _“6, 6 to 8, 6 to 10.”_[^216]

74     Having reviewed the evidence, I found that the Accused has used the April 2016 Meeting to share his knowledge and also to provide advice to PW9 and PW10 on “_try\[ing\] young blood_” (_i.e._ minors under 18 years) in the Philippines. The information that the Accused has distributed to PW9 and PW10 was precisely to address PW9 and PW10’s queries and to assist them in making the necessary arrangements to procure sex with minors outside of Singapore.

75     I found that the information provided by the Accused during the April 2016 Meeting was intended to promote the conduct of commercial sex with minors outside Singapore.

76     I shall now address the main aspects of the Accused’s defence.

### Issue 2: Whether the Accused attended the meetings due to his legitimate commercial interest in ERASIG LLP

77     The Defence’s case is that the Accused attended both meetings with the undercover police officers as he was seeking legitimate business opportunities for ERASIG LLP (“the Company”).[^217] The Accused is a co-partner of the Company together with his wife. The Company engages in the business of management consultancy and professional training in management skills.[^218]

78     During the cross-examination of PW8, the counsel for the Accused had put across the Accused’s instruction to PW8 that:

> (a)     the Accused attended the September 2015 and April 2016 Meetings with the intention of sourcing for legitimate business for the Company[^219];

> (b)     the reason why PW8 asked the Accused on Yahoo Online Messenger if he organised tours to Thailand and Cambodia was because he knew that the Company organises legitimate tours to Thailand and Cambodia[^220];

> (c)     the Accused could assist the former to buy air tickets because he was in a legitimate business[^221]; and

> (d)     the Accused chose a public place that is Starbucks Coffee café as the location for the September 2015 Meeting because he agreed to meet with the intention of promoting his legitimate tour business of the Company.[^222]

79     The Accused’s instructions, as narrated above, were materially inconsistent with his oral testimonies when he was cross-examined by the Prosecution. The Accused admitted that he did not raise the Company’s name at all during the meetings, or explain to the undercover police officers that he was running a legitimate tour business, or informed them that he could give them tours to Philippines and Cambodia for legitimate purposes, or suggested that he could not do what they wanted.[^223] When the Accused was asked to provide his explanation for not informing the undercover police officers about the Company, the Accused testified that there was no reason for him to do so – in his own words, _“why should I?”_.[^224] The Accused explained that the undercover police officers were unknown to him, and raising the Company’s name could put the Company at risk.[^225]

80     It was simply unconvincing that the Company could be put at risk if the Accused shared with the undercover police officers the legitimate business of the Company. I agree with the Prosecution that it is unlikely that paedophiles who mistakenly thought that the legitimate tour agency was a nefarious business enterprise would report about the Company for refusing to accommodate to their immoral ends.

81     Further, the Accused admitted during cross-examination that the Company only provides the administrative and logistical aspects of tours it organised (such as transportation, accommodation, entrance fees for sightseeing tours and travel insurance), but does _not_ provide a local guide. The Accused testified that he could not provide a local guide as the Company would need to be a registered tour company in the Philippines to do that.[^226] However, the Accused had conveyed to PW8 that the budget of S$1,500 includes _“individual travel guide/compagnion \[sic\]_.”[^227] Accordingly, the tour which the Accused was arranging for PW8 could not have been a legitimate business tour of the Company.

82     I also observed that the undercover police officers did not approach the Accused in his capacity as partner of the Company – instead, the undercover police officers were _very upfront_ about their predilections to the Accused as early as in the online conversations on Yahoo Online Messenger and Darkfetish.net, _i.e._ even _before_ the Accused attended the meetings. The Accused attended the meetings because he intended to distribute information relating to commercial sex with minors in the Philippines to the undercover police officers.

83     There is nothing in the conversations on Yahoo Online Messenger and Darkfetish.net as well as in both meetings, which would have suggested that there could be other business opportunities aside from commercial sex with minors outside Singapore.[^228]

84     In my judgment, I found that the September 2015 and April 2016 meetings had nothing to do with the legitimate businesses of the Company. In both these meetings, I found that the Accused knew that PW6 and PW8 (for the September 2015 Meeting) and PW9 and PW10 (for the April 2016 Meeting) had approached him for very specific purposes, namely, to seek the Accused’s advice for, and to get the Accused’s assistance to arrange for, commercial sex with minors outside Singapore.

### Issue 3: Whether the Accused’s alleged non-responsiveness illustrates his disinterest

85     In relation to the chat log between the Accused and PW8 on Yahoo Online Messenger (Exhibit P22), the Accused testified that there were various periods of long silence by him when “XXX” sent him various queries. The Accused testified that this was because he was _“not interested”_[^229] in providing information on commercial sex with young girls or with _“providing the tours”_[^230] and wanted _“to keep \[his\] distance”_[^231]. The Accused pointed to several examples of such intervals:

> (a)     a two-day interval between “XXX’s” message on 21/6/2015, 12.18 am and the Accused’s response on 23/6/2015 at 6.28 pm;

> (b)     a 10-day interval between “XXX’s” message on 4/7/2015, 9.44 pm, his chasers on 10/7/2015 and 14/7/2015, 9.27 pm before the Accused’s response on 14/7/2015, 10.16 pm; and

> (c)     a 9-day interval between “XXX’s” message from 14/8/2015, 12.07 am, his chaser on 22/8/2015, 11.27 pm, before the Accused’s response on 23/8/2015, 12.16 am.[^232]

86     The Accused’s submission is without merit. The conversations on Yahoo Online Messenger has to be viewed in its entirety, and not in bits and pieces. The entire conversation illustrated that the Accused did in fact respond to “XXX” despite his delayed responses.[^233] Further, I found that some of the exchanges between “XXX” and the Accused were linked to a different set of exchanges between the Accused and one “XXX” on Skype Messenger (Exhibit P21). Exhibit P21 clearly illustrates that the Accused had started to make enquiries to “XXX” to meet “XXX” requests. In my assessment, “XXX” was possibly a _middleman_, which is consistent with the information that the Accused had conveyed that he had a middleman who could arrange for sex with minors. One can readily observe from the table below that the enquiries directed to “XXX” mirror the requests made by “XXX”.

87     In my judgment, the Accused could not timeously respond to “XXX” because he was awaiting confirmation from “XXX” as to whether the requested minor girls were available. In this regard, I observed that during the 9-day interval between 14 August 2015 and 23 August 2015 (see \[85(c)\] above), the Accused had asked “XXX” how they can proceed[^234], whether he or she had thought about the Accused’s ideas[^235] and what the plan was.[^236] It is clear that these “ideas” refer to the Accused’s requests for minor girls because by 14 August 2015 (i.e. when the interval began), the Accused had conveyed to “XXX” the requests relating to the request for minors, number of girls, requests for virginity of the girls and the tour period.

88     Most crucially, I observed that the Accused’s counsel had during the Prosecution’s case challenged the admissibility of the Skype Online Messenger chats (Exhibit P21). I had overruled the objection. As the trial progressed, during the Accused’s cross-examination, he did not deny that he had spoken to “XXX” (as per Exhibit P21). In fact, he could not. As the evidence revealed, the content of the Accused’s conversation with “XXX” was detrimental to his defence. The Accused then adopted another approach by claiming that he had no intention to deliver to PW8 the minor girls as requested.[^237] The constant flip-flop and changes in evidence by the Accused whenever cornered by the Prosecution in cross-examination showed how incredible and poor his evidence was. To say the least, it was devoid of merit.

89     During Accused’s cross-examination in relation to the Skype Online Messenger chats (Exhibit P21) between the Accused and “XXX”, the Prosecution had suggested that he was in communication with “XXX” in order to convey the requests of “XXX” to the former.[^238] The Accused disagreed with the suggestion. Instead, he alleged that the _“chats ha\[ve\] been tampered in a way to provide this information”_ and that the _“chat is forged_.[^239]_”_ However, the allegations of tampering and forgery were not put to any of the Prosecution’s witnesses by the Accused’s counsel during cross-examination of these witnesses, and were only raised much later by the Accused when he was cross-examined. In my judgment, the Accused’s allegation of tampering and forgery was a mere afterthought. The Accused was clearly grasping at straws when he realised how damaging Exhibit P21 was to his case.

90     The Accused claimed that he was disinterested in the topic. I rejected his evidence. Firstly, I found no instance during the course of the conversations, both online and at the face-to-face meetings, suggesting that the Accused was not interested. On the contrary, I found him a willing and interested participant in the conversations. Secondly, I observed that the proposal for the meeting to discuss further, after the conversation on Yahoo Online Messenger, in fact came from the Accused, and not the undercover police officers.[^240] In my assessment, the Accused proposed to meet because he was interested in distributing information to the undercover police officers on commercial sex with minors outside Singapore.

### Issue 4: Whether the Accused’s termination of communication with the undercover police officers showed a lack of intention

91     The Defence submitted that the Accused stopped communicating with PW8 after the September 2015 Meeting and the April 2016 Meeting, and this points towards a lack of intention by the Accused to distribute information to promote commercial sex with minors outside Singapore. The Defence has clearly missed the point. The crux of the two charges was that the distribution of the information took place at the September 2015 Meeting and the April 2016 Meeting itself. The termination of the communications merely showed that the nefarious activities proposed by the Accused did not go any further than mere talks.

92     In any event, this submission is entirely without merit when I assessed the evidence in relation to the September 2015 Meeting. The Accused turned down the request of “XXX” to organise a tour **_only after_** obtaining confirmation from “XXX” that she was unable to meet the Accused’s requests for the provision of minor girls. The following chronology of events clearly illustrate that prior to the Accused turning down “XXX’s” request, he had asked “XXX” whether the girls were available:

### Issue 5: Whether the Accused merely played along with the undercover police officers

93     During the course of trial, the Accused repeatedly testified that he was merely “playing along” with the undercover police officers. Among these instances are as follows:

> (a)     During cross-examination of the Accused, the Accused testified that he had no intention to accede to the requests of the undercover police officers and that he was merely leading them on.[^245]

> (b)     During the April 2016 Meeting, PW10 asked how the Accused specified the age range to his contacts. The Accused suggested to PW10 that he _“can give an age range”_ and that this age range could be _“6, 6 to 8, 6 to 10."_ When questioned by his counsel during examination-in-chief, the Accused stated that he “_played along_” and “_wanted to challenge \[PW9 and PW10\] a little bit_” because they always told him they wanted young girls but did not specify the ages.[^246]

> (c)     On Yahoo Online Messenger (Exhibit P22), “XXX” messaged the Accused saying _“We need young, inexperience, we are tired of old pussy_._”_ In response, the Accused said _“Ok how many and how young_._”_ When questioned by his counsel during examination-in-chief on this exchange, the Accused testified that he was playing along because he did not want to offend PW8; that reference to “young” was simply that PW8 did not want to have “_grandmas_”; and that he did not know what age “young” meant[^247].

> (d)     On Yahoo Online Messenger (Exhibit P22), “XXX” messaged the Accused saying _“We have tried many in Singapore and even 18 yrs old. Do you have younger ones and better if virgin.”_ XXX asked the Accused to plan for them, that they did not have specific choices on location and that they wanted to have fun and that the tour should be covert and safe. The Accused replied XXX with _“Ok in progress. How many compagnions \[sic\] u need?”_ When questioned by his counsel during examination-in-chief on this exchange, the Accused testified that he kept playing along with PW8 and that his response did not mean that he had already planned.

94     In my judgment, it was incredible for the Accused to testify that he was merely “playing along” with the undercover police officers. The undercover police officers very clearly conveyed their predilections to the Accused (i.e. to engage in commercial sex with minors overseas), as early as 11 June 2015 in Yahoo Online Messenger in relation to charge C1A, and as early as 20 January 2016 in Darkfetish.net in relation to charge C2A. The Accused went so far as to meet the undercover police officers in person – in fact, the Accused was the one who suggested to meet in person to discuss further.[^248] I found that the Accused met the undercover police officers to ascertain the travel plans and demands of the undercover police officers with the intent to distribute information about commercial sex with minors outside Singapore. The Accused’s responses in both conversations on Yahoo Online Messenger and Darkfetish.net, as well as during both meetings, definitely do not support the Accused’s testimony that he was playing along with the undercover police officers. I found that there was completely no logical reason for the Accused to contact “XXX” and specifically, to convey the requests which mirrored those of “XXX” if he was simply “playing along”.

95     I found that the Accused’s specific suggestion of a child as young as _six years of age_ points towards the Accused’s culpability because PW9 and PW10 did not themselves express interest in girls as young as six years old. The Accused had effectively introduced potential sex tourists to the possibility of younger child victims than they had contemplated and so increased the potential for harm that could result if the tour took place. The Accused’s suggestion of a child as young as 6 years old was not beyond him for there is evidence in Exhibit P15 of a screenshot of a very young child performing fellatio. The filename of the said screenshot is “michelle\_4yo.wmv” – to my understanding, the term “4yo” could only refer to “4 years old”.

96     The Accused’s responses referred to in paragraphs 93(c) and 93(d) do not strike me as one where the Accused was merely playing along. The Accused, who was well aware that these undercover police officers wanted him to help organise a tour for commercial sex with minors outside Singapore, was asking the undercover police officers further questions in order to facilitate his planning of the tours for them.

97     In my overall assessment of the evidence, I rejected the defences put forth by the Accused. I found that the Accused has failed to raise any reasonable doubt.

## Conviction

98     I was thus satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused accordingly.

99     I shall now turn to address the issue of sentence.

## Sentence

### Sentencing Principles for offences under s 376D(1)(c)

100    This Court was guided by the decision of the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _Chan Chun Hong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 465</span> (“_Chan Chun Hong_”). In addressing the issue of sentencing an offence under s 376D(1)(c) of the Penal Code, Menon CJ suggested a three-stage inquiry (\[132\] and \[133\]):

> (a)     At the first stage of the inquiry, the Court should consider where in the spectrum the offending conduct lay. Menon CJ classified the spectrum into three broad categories in ascending levels of seriousness which would attract ascending levels of punishment.

> (b)     At the second stage of the inquiry, the Court should consider where in the spectrum between the _ad hoc_ facilitator and the commercial sex tour operator the offender falls. The further away the offender is from the _ad hoc_ facilitator, the greater the case for imposing a yet more serious sentence falling outside the ranges in _Chan Chun Hong._

> (c)     Finally, the Court should bear in mind the factors set out at \[54\] and \[129\] of _Chan Chun Hong_ to consider whether there are further aggravating or mitigating factors which call for an adjustment to the sentence.

### Stage One – Categorising Information Distributed by the Accused

101    In _Chan Chun Hong_, Menon CJ stated that the severity of an offence depends on the mischief that might be caused by the information transmitted. Menon CJ classified the spectrum of offending into three broad categories in ascending levels of seriousness and punishment, as follows (_Chan Chun Hong_ at \[132\]):

> (a)     General information in the form of reportage provided to like-minded individuals. This information may not actively further the mischief of enhancing demand for child sex tourism having regard to both the quality of the information and the inclinations of the recipient. This constitutes the lowest end of the spectrum. For offences falling within this category, a sentence of up to nine months’ imprisonment may be considered.

> (b)     Further up the sentencing spectrum, more serious offending conduct involves transmission of detailed knowledge, in particular information about the availability of the trade in specific locations or information as to particular contacts, but conveyed to like-minded individuals. This may be aggravated where it is done for an ulterior and objectionable motive such as to exchange corresponding information with others of a similar bent. What primarily aggravates the offence here is the nature of the information. For offences falling within this category, a sentence of between 12 and 30 months’ imprisonment may be considered as a starting point.

> (c)     The offender’s culpability increases sharply where he is found to have encouraged the recipient to embark on a venture that the recipient was not already intending to embark on. Both the nature of the information and the effect on the initial inclinations of the recipients can aggravate the offence and where this is the case, sentences in excess of 36 months’ imprisonment may be considered as a starting point.

102    The Defence submitted that the statements made by the Accused in the course of the September 2015 and the April 2016 Meetings constitutes general information in the public domain, _i.e._ constituting the lowest end of the spectrum. In support of its submission, the Defence referred to five articles obtained from the Internet (Exhibits D15, D16, D17, D18 and D19). The Accused testified that this was merely a _“small sample”_ of articles to illustrate that information relating to commercial sex with minors is available in a lot of internet articles and newspapers.[^249] Further, the Accused testified that in assessing the source of the information, regard must be had to the fact that the Accused has travelled to Asia since 2006[^250], and that he has a _“contact of friends”_ through which he _“learned a lot”_ about _“the practices in Asia”_ including the _“normal type of sex business in the various kind of countries.”[^251]_ To sum up, the Defence argued that the information provided by the Accused was too vague to pose any threat to a minor.

#### Stage One Sentencing Inquiry for charge C1A

103    I found that the Accused’s conduct in relation to charge C1A encourages and promotes the commission of an offence under s 376C of the Penal Code. The Accused portrayed himself as an experienced and knowledgeable person in relation to commercial sex with minors in the Philippines. Coupled with the solutions given by the Accused to potential problems that PW6 and PW8 might face, the Accused’s statements encourage potential sex tourists to think that the venture was unlikely to pose significant problems – thereby encouraging them to engage in commercial sex with minors in Philippines. The fact that the Accused shared the places which were _“safer”_ would encourage potential sex tourists to think that the Accused had identified the places he intended for them to visit.

104    The Accused even went as far as stating that he would arrange for minor girls of the particular specifications given by PW6 and PW8 – information that would encourage potential sex tourists to engage in even more of such conduct because they would be able to have their preferences met. This was amplified by the fact that the Accused shared that he had _“relation\[s\]”_ or _“connection\[s\]”_ to assist him in arranging for PW6 and PW8 to engage in commercial sex with minors in Philippines. Such information would reassure potential sex tourists that the venture would likely go smoothly as such relations or connections would be able assist the Accused to meet their demands. In distributing such information, the Accused appeared to be recommending particular places as worthwhile for PW6 and PW8 to visit.

105    In my judgment, the following information in particular did not constitute general information:

> (a)     the information that it was more difficult to bring the minor girls directly to the hotels because it could arouse suspicion; and

> (b)     the solution which Accused gave to address such a problem (booking two rooms).

The Accused could only have known these matters through his own experience and/or by actual knowledge through his “relation \[s\] or “connection \[s\] in the industry of commercial sex with minors in Philippines.

106    Most importantly, the fact that the Accused contacted “XXX” and attempted to procure minor girls is a significant aggravating factor. The Accused did not also shy away from the fact that he had connections with persons who could arrange for PW6 and PW8’s endeavours. Taken together, this would encourage PW6 and PW8 to engage in commercial sex with minors. It appears to be a degree of facilitation by the Accused which could have resulted in direct contact with the minor girls had “XXX” meet the Accused’s request.

107    Further, the specific location for commercial sex with minors overseas came entirely from the Accused. The Accused had suggested a specific city, _“Cebu”_, even though PW8 merely expressed interest in the following countries: _“Thailand, Cambodia or Philippines_._”_[^252] However, I observed that a basic Internet search reveals the following: (a) a news report stating that _“Cebu is now commonly known as one of south-east Asia’s hubs for child exploitation”_[^253]; and (b) a paper on child sex tourism stating _“Cebu…is widely known to have the highest rates of CST \[child sex tourism\] in the country…”_[^254] Nevertheless, I found that the Accused had conveyed the sense of greater and reliable knowledge of the city. By suggesting that PW6 and PW8 could go to Cebu _after_ they had indicated their preferences for minor girls of a certain age, the Accused gives the impression that he knew of the ages of minors available in that city. Such information would bring the Accused’s conduct within the moderate range of the scale. In this regard, I was guided by _Chan Chun Hong_ at \[135\].

108    I found that the information provided to PW6 and PW8 during the September 2015 Meeting involved transmission of detailed knowledge conveyed to like-minded individuals, and fell within the moderate range of the scale set out at paragraph 101(b) above.

#### Stage One Sentencing Inquiry for Charge C2A

109    In relation to charge C2A, the impression conveyed by the Accused was that engaging in commercial sex with minors in the Philippines was an easy and straightforward one. In fact, during the April 2016 Meeting, PW10 remarked to the Accused: _“To be honest, you make it sound so easy.”_ The Accused then responded to this statement stating that _“it is easy”_ and that to the people in Philippines, _“it is just about money_._”_ The Accused’s was actively encouraging potential sex tourists to engage in commercial sex with minors outside Singapore by conveying to them the ease at which the venture could be done by simply paying money.

110    The Accused’s passing on of information to PW9 and PW10 as to the required budget of 10,000 pesos (approximately S$300), coupled with the fact that he stated 10,000 pesos was _“totally overpriced”_, and his indication that the “normal” price could be even lower (5,000 pesos), would have encouraged potential sex tourists to engage in commercial sex with minors in the Philippines because of the extremely low cost involved. The Accused’s distribution of information as to the locations in the Philippines which would be “safer” would have led PW9 and PW10 to think that the Accused had identified locations which were safe and unlikely to pose serious risks to them. In this respect, I was guided by _Chan Chun Hong_, at \[140\], where the Court held that information relating to the relatively low budget, as well as information relating to the safe and well-organised nature of the place intended for commercial sex with minors, taken together was conduct designed to encourage and promote the commission of the offence under s 376C of the Penal Code.

111    The Accused’s statement that it was easier to procure girls aged between 6 to 12 years old as opposed to girls aged 13 to 17 years old (due to the latter’s school examinations) in circumstances where PW9 and PW10 merely indicated their preference for “young blood”, _without_ actually specifying the ages they preferred was directed towards encouraging the recipient to indulge in commercial sex with potentially _even younger and more vulnerable_ victims. The fact that the Accused even stated the age range of minors as young as 6 years old would suggest to PW9 and PW10 that it was possible to get minors that young, which could encourage them to consider a younger age group than they may have originally contemplated.

112    Further, the specific location for commercial sex with minors overseas came entirely from the Accused. PW8 in the Darkfetish.net chat logs did not indicate any countries to engage in such an endeavour, and left it to the Accused. The Accused in turn narrowed down to _“africa or asia”_[^255], then _“Southeast asia”_[^256] and at the April 2016 Meeting suggested _“Philippines”_[^257] and eventually narrowed down to _“Manilla \[sic\]_.”[^258] I observed that an Internet search reveals that Manila is a hotspot for commercial sex with minors. A paper on child sex tourism states that _“Manila and Cebu are the treasure lands of girl prostitutes.”_[^259] Nevertheless, I found that the Accused had conveyed the sense of greater and reliable knowledge of Manila by identifying the specific city where commercial sex with minors was available.

113    Further, various statements by the Accused were information which was not generally available information but information he directly obtained from his contacts:

> (a)     Information relating to which age groups of minors could be procured more easily, as well as the reasons why they could be procured more easily, was not general information readily available. This is information which the Accused would have known only if he had experience or direct knowledge of the industry of commercial sex with minors in the Philippines.

> (b)     Prosecution drew my attention to a statement in Exhibit D16, a MailOnline article[^260] adduced by the Defence: _“The idea that these women come from the provinces, naively seeking the city lights, is out of date. Most of them are second generation city dwellers”._ This article appears inconsistent with a statement conveyed by the Accused to PW9 and PW10 during the April 2016 Meeting – i.e. that the girls came _“especially from the provinces_.”[^261] This same piece of information was in fact conveyed by “XXX” to the Accused in the Skype Messenger conversation, Exhibit P21 – “XXX” told him that there were _“many girls in provence \[sic\]”[^262]_. The information that the girls came from the provinces therefore constituted detailed knowledge which the Accused relayed to PW9 and PW10 at the April 2016 Meeting.

> (c)     I also observed that the information that the girls would commute by bus to Manila was obtained from “XXX” who told the Accused that he needed to provide fare for the minor girls to come to Manila, and that the fare by bus would be 1,700 pesos each.[^263]

114    In my judgment, the information provided to PW9 and PW10 did not constitute generally available information but involved transmission of detailed knowledge conveyed to like-minded individuals, which fell within the moderate range of the scale set out at paragraph 101(b) above.

### Stage Two of the Sentencing Inquiry

115    In my judgment, the Accused fell within the middle range of the spectrum between an _ad hoc_ facilitator and the commercial sex operator. The Accused was acting as a middleman for the two proposed transactions. He was the “go-to” man for the undercover police officers. However, I considered that the Accused was at the lower end of this “middleman” chain.

### Indicative Starting Sentence for both Charges

116    Having come to the end of the first two stages of the sentencing inquiry, I looked to _Chan Chun Hong_ for further guidance.

117    I observed that in relation to the 138th charge in _Chan Chun Hong_, the offender had passed on information relating to the budget, assured the recipient that the place was “quite well-organised” and “definitely safe”, and sent explicit photographs of young girls with genitals exposed. Menon CJ stated that a sentence of around 30 months’ imprisonment would not have been out of place. I considered that the Accused in the present case had apprised the undercover police officers in _both charges_: of places which were _“safer”_, and informed them that he would make arrangements through his connections and the middleman. I also considered that although the Accused did not distribute explicit photographs to the undercover police officers in both charges, the information distributed by the Accused was of such a sheer quantity compared to that in _Chan Chun Hong_ – thereby justifying the imposition of a sentence in a similar range. This was especially so in charge C1A where the Accused had attempted to arrange through “XXX” for PW6 and PW8 to engage in commercial sex with minors in Philippines.

118    In relation to the 135th charge in _Chan Chun Hong_, where the offender actively encouraged a recipient to gravitate towards girls of even younger age by sharing his personal preference for girls aged 12 to 14, Menon CJ did not consider a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment to be manifestly excessive. In the present case, a similar information was distributed by the Accused when he suggested girls as young as 6 years old, and that girls aged 6 to 12 was easier to source. However, I noted that this was but _one such information_ falling within the scope of charge C2A.

119    All factors considered, the indicative starting point is 30 months’ imprisonment in relation to charge C1A and 26 months’ imprisonment in relation to charge C2A. In my judgment, the conduct of the Accused in charge C1A was more culpable amongst the two charges. Accordingly, a higher indicative starting point was given.

### Stage Three of the Sentencing Inquiry – Adjusting for aggravating and mitigating factors

#### Aggravating Factors in charge C1A

120    There were several aggravating factors that justified an uplift in the indicative starting sentence for charge C1A.

121    A very significant aggravating factor in relation to Charge C1A was the fact that the Accused made actual attempts to procure minor girls for commercial sex. He contacted “XXX” and conveyed the requests of PW8, asking “XXX” if she could procure the minor girls who met such requests.

122    Secondly, although the Accused did not go so far as to distribute child pornography, the _nature_ of the information conveyed by the Accused was so clinical and of such sheer quantity that it constitutes an aggravating factor. The Accused conveyed an impression that the places he recommended to PW6 and PW8 were worthwhile places to visit. The information given relating to the Accused having relations or connections, that he could ask his friend to make arrangements, that certain places were safer, the solutions given to potential problems which the undercover police officers may encounter, would encourage them to think that the Accused had identified places for them to visit and that there would unlikely be problems to the venture. This was conduct which would enhance the demand for child sex tourism.

123    Thirdly, the Accused had distributed information which would assist the undercover police officers to avoid suspicion and detection.

#### Aggravating Factors in Charge C2A

124    There were three aggravating factors which justified an uplift from the indicative starting sentence for charge C2A.

125    Firstly, the _nature_ of the information conveyed by the Accused was so clinical and of such sheer quantity that it constitutes an aggravating factor. The Accused conveyed an impression to PW9 and PW10 that engaging in commercial sex with minors in Philippines was easy and straightforward. I was also mindful of the fact that the Accused told PW9 and PW10 that engaging in commercial sex with minors was _“just about money”_ because the people there were poor. The information that certain places were safer, as well as the solutions given to potential problems which the undercover police officers may encounter, would encourage PW9 and PW10 to think that the Accused had identified places for them to visit and that there would unlikely be problems to the venture. Crucially, I found that the low budget required for the venture conveyed by the Accused would further encourage potential sex tourists to engage in commercial sex with minors overseas. This would enhance the demand for child sex tourism.

126    Secondly, the information distributed by the Accused was not information available in the public domain, but constituted actual knowledge he possessed. The Accused distributed information which the undercover police officers would have difficulty obtaining freely from the public domain.

127    Thirdly, I observed that the information distributed by the Accused included information which would assist the undercover police officers to avoid suspicion and detection. These were: (a) the fact that the Accused informed the undercover police officers to book an international hotel because they offered multiple key cards instead of a single physical key; (b) the fact that the Accused would arrange the minor girls to be accompanied by an adult female to minimise suspicion; and (c) the fact that he informed the undercover police officers that two hotel rooms (one occupied by the undercover police officers, and the other occupied by the minor girl and adult female) would be booked to minimise suspicion.

#### No Significant Mitigating Factor

128    In its plea in mitigation, the Defence submitted that the Accused was incited and instigated by undercover police officers who had entrapped and set him up. As such, mitigating weight should be given. I did not agree with this submission for two reasons.

129    Firstly, the involvement of an _agent provocateur_ in the commission of the s 376D Penal Code offence should not result in a reduction of sentences. The exception is where there was a reasonable basis for concluding that the offender would not have committed the offence in question had the _agent provocateur_ not been involved: _Chan Chun Hong_ at \[66\]. This usually arises in “_exceptional cases”_ such as the Australian case of _R v N_ \[1999\] NSWCCA 187 (“_R v N”_), where the police officers played an _active_ role in encouraging or inciting the offending conduct. Entrapment has no mitigating value if an _agent provocateur_ provides nothing more than an unexceptional opportunity for the crime to be committed (_Chan Chun Hong_ at \[66\]), and merely approaches a target as any other consumer or intending participant in such activities might: _Chan Chun Hong_ at \[67\]. In such cases, any trap set by the police is but a tool by which necessary evidence for the Prosecution can be obtained: _Chan Chun Hong_ at \[67\]. In the present case, the Defence has failed to satisfy the court that the exception was applicable on the facts of the case. On the contrary, I found:

> (a)     The undercover police officers approached the Accused as any intending participant in the same activities might; and

> (b)     Applying _R v N_, this was not a situation where the Accused was reluctant to commit an offence under s 376D and the undercover police officers attempted to overcome that reluctance. There was no suggestion by the Accused that he was reluctant to commit such an offence, and instead appeared very facilitative towards the undercover police officers; and

> (c)     The Accused, on his own volition, has taken an extra step to approach “XXX” to facilitate the arrangements before informing PW8 that _“\[n\]ot wasting your money or giving you something you need not asked for i need to postpone.”[^264]_

130    Secondly, I found that the Accused was neither incited nor instigated by the undercover police officers. There is no evidence which suggests that the Accused was incited, instigated or pressured in any way to divulge information. Instead, the evidence reveals a very willing Accused providing detailed information and solutions to potential risks to the undercover police officers. The evidence clearly shows that the undercover police officers provided no more than an unexceptional opportunity for the crime to be committed:

131    The Defence highlighted that the Accused does not have any previous criminal antecedent. The Defence also submitted that the offences committed by the Accused are out of character. A court may regard evidence of an offender’s long and unblemished record as a mitigating factor of modest weight if it is possible to infer that the offender’s actions were “out of character” and he was unlikely to re-offend. In the present case, the Accused did re-offend by his conduct leading to the April 2016 Meeting. Moreover, general deterrence should be the main consideration in this case. As such, the mitigating weight would be readily displaced: _Ang Peng Tiam v Singapore Medical Council and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 356</span> at \[103\], followed in _Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span>. The focus must be on sending a clear message to potential sexual predators of the harsh consequences that await them.

132    In conclusion, I found that there was no significant mitigating factor in favour of the Accused.

### Final Decision on Sentence

133    In the final analysis, continuing from the indicative starting point of 30 months’ imprisonment for charge C1A and 26 months’ imprisonment for the charge C2A , it is this Court’s assessment that:

> (a)     No downward adjustment was warranted because there are no significant mitigating factors; and

> (b)     An upward adjustment of the indicative starting point was warranted for both charges, with a higher upward adjustment in respect of charge C1A to account for the Accused’s higher culpability and aggravating factors involved.

134    Accordingly, I meted out a sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment for charge C1A and a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment for charge C2A.

### Consecutive Sentences

135    In my judgment, both sentences should run consecutively. In reaching this decision, I had regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle: _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ at \[25\]. In my judgment, these principles are not breached by running the two sentences consecutively.

136    I was not persuaded by the Defence’s submissions calling for the two sentences to run concurrently. Firstly, the two charges did not form part of a single transaction and involved _separate_ violations of a single legally protected interest (i.e. to protect minors in “destination countries” from being commercially exploited by sexual predators from “sending countries”): _Chan Chun Hong_ at \[145\] and \[146\]. The two offences were committed in separate time periods, were not part of a continuum of events and involved different undercover police officers. In my judgment, the two offences were “unrelated”: _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen”_) at \[68\] to \[70\]. An offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively: _Raveen_ at \[41\] to \[46\].

137    Secondly, consecutive sentences is necessary to ensure that the Accused does not benefit from the court’s failure to recognise the multiplicity of offences committed. Further, consecutive sentencing is also necessary in order to give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence to discourage similar behaviour.

138    I disagreed with the Defence’s submission that running the sentences consecutively would be contrary to s 307(1) of the CPC, and that s 307(1) of the CPC requires the sentences for two offences to run consecutively _only if_ an accused is convicted of at least three offences. Even where there are only two offences, as in the present case, s 307(1) of the CPC retains its relevance and operates regardless of whether the multiple offences form a single transaction or otherwise: _Raveen_ at \[52\]. The general rule of consecutive sentences for offences not forming a single transaction does not contravene s 307(1) of the CPC or render it otiose.

## Conclusion

139    For the reasons given above, I meted out the individual sentences of 36 months’ imprisonment for charge C1A and 30 months’ imprisonment for charge C2A. I ordered both sentences to run consecutively. The total sentence was therefore 66 months’ imprisonment.
