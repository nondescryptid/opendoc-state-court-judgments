Criminal Law – Offences – Property – Cheating

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9109/2022/01.\]

29 August 2022

### District Judge Lau Qiuyu:

1       The accused, Jaguar Tan, pleaded guilty before me after two days of trial to one charge of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “PC”). He admitted to and consented for two other charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing – one under s 420 of the PC, and the other under s 471 punishable under s 465 of the PC.

2       After convicting the accused, I imposed a sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment for the single proceeded charge.

3       The accused has lodged an appeal against sentence and I set out the reasons for my decision below. A stay of execution on the sentence was allowed further to the lodging of the appeal. The accused is presently on bail pending the appeal.

## The charge

4       The charge for cheating under s 420 of the PC is reproduced in full below:

> DAC-909197-2019

> You… are charged that you, on 15 October 2017 at about 10pm, at Block 9 Haig Road, Singapore, did cheat one Soh Chey Hean, _to wit_, by deceiving him into believing that you were borrowing money from him for your son’s medical bills, a fact which you knew was false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced him to transfer $35,000/- to your POSB bank account \[xxx\], and you have thereby committed an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Facts

5       The accused admitted to the statement of facts without qualification. The salient facts have been summarised and reproduced below.

6       The victim is Soh Chey Hean. The victim was a colleague of the accused’s brother, Tan Shi Feng, from the Navy. Tan Shi Feng (the “co-accused”) was convicted on multiple cheating charges on 1 October 2019, which, among others, included one charge of intentionally aiding the accused to cheat the victim of $35,000 (_ie_, the same incident for which the accused has pleaded guilty to in the current proceedings). The relevant material pertaining to the sentences that had earlier been meted out to the co-accused are found at Annexes A to D of the statement of facts: (a) see Annex A1 to A13 for the six charges which the co-accused pleaded guilty to and the seven charges which were taken into consideration; (b) see Annex B for the statement of facts which the co-accused admitted to without qualification; (c) see Annex C for the co-accused’s plea in mitigation; and (d) see Annex D for the Registrar’s Certificate setting out the sentences imposed on the co-accused.

7       By 15 October 2017, the co-accused had borrowed money from the victim on multiple occasions. On 15 October 2017, sometime before or around 9.30pm, the accused informed the victim that he was at a void deck near the victim’s residence. The accused informed the victim that he wanted to meet up with the victim to discuss the repayment of the monies that the co-accused owed to the victim.

8       At or around 10pm, the victim met up with the accused and the co-accused at the void deck at Block 9 Haig Road, Singapore. This was the first time the victim and the accused met.

9       When they met, the accused showed the victim a picture of a baby with some tubes attached (see Annex E of the statement of facts). The accused also showed the victim a newspaper article which featured his family including his son (see Annexes F and G of the statement of facts). The accused told the victim that the baby in the picture in Annex E was his son. The accused also told the victim that he needed money for his son’s medical bills – the accused knew this representation to be false, as the accused knew that he did not need money for his son’s medical bills.

10     The accused cheated the victim by deceiving the victim into believing that the accused was borrowing money from the victim for his son’s medical bills, a fact which the accused knew was false, and by such deception, the accused dishonestly induced the victim to transfer $35,000 from the victim’s bank account to the accused’s bank account. During the conversation, the co-accused chimed in and corroborated the accused’s lies. The victim was initially reluctant but later gave in when the accused and co-accused continued to pressure him.

11     After the meeting, the victim went home. There was no discussion of a repayment plan for the co-accused’s loans at the meeting. The victim transferred the sum of $35,000 from his bank account to the accused’s bank account on the same day (_ie_, 15 October 2017) at around 11.15pm by Internet banking.

12     After receiving the $35,000 from the victim, the accused transferred $17,290 from his bank account to the co-accused’s bank account at around 11.54pm. None of the $35,000 transferred by the victim to the accused was used for the accused’s son’s medical bills. The accused never required $35,000 for his son’s medical bills. The accused used at least $9,000 of the $35,000 to gamble.

13     On 26 November 2017, the victim lodged a police report (see Annex H of the statement of facts). No restitution has been made.

## Sentencing

### Antecedents

14     The accused is untraced.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

15     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 16 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution relied on two main submissions in support of their position: (a) general deterrence as the predominant sentencing principle; and (b) parity in sentencing with the co-accused.

16     First, as regards general deterrence, the Prosecution submitted that the proposed sentence was justified given the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     Planning and premeditation / sophistication of offence: The accused and co-accused had carefully organised the operation with deliberate deception, with the accused bolstering his false representation by showing the victim a picture of a sick baby and a newspaper article of his family.

> (b)     Significant value cheated and extent of actual loss: The victim was cheated of $35,000, of which no restitution had been made by the accused.

> (c)     Use of pressure on victim: The victim was initially reluctant to part with his money but later gave in when the accused and the co-accused continued to pressure him.

> (d)     Charges taken into consideration: There were two charges which were taken into consideration, of which one related to the cheating of the same victim with the same co-accused (involving a cheated sum of $7,000).

> (e)     Role of the offender: The accused had a heavier hand in the deception of the victim, as he painted the narrative that his child was sick and that he needed money. He had also taken a larger share of the cheated sum as compared to the co-accused. Nonetheless, the Prosecution recognised that the co-accused was complicit as he had introduced the accused to the victim at that meeting and had corroborated the accused’s lies at the meeting.

17     Second, as regards parity in sentencing, the Prosecution highlighted that the co-accused was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment for abetting the accused in cheating the victim for this same incident on 15 October 2017 (which was ordered to run concurrently). The co-accused was sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 30 months.

18     The Prosecution relied on the decision of _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span> (“_Chong Han Rui_”) for the proposition that where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, their sentences should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances. Further, the Prosecution also cited _BPH v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 764</span> (“_BPH_”) for the proposition that when looking at precedents which involved multiple charges, the sentence for each charge could have been calibrated downwards to ensure that the court arrived at a proportionate aggregate sentence (at \[83\] of _BPH_).

19     The Prosecution noted that the co-accused faced more cheating charges globally, several of which involved the same victim. The co-accused also had a long-standing relationship with the victim which the co-accused had abused. However, the Prosecution submitted that such aggravating factors pertaining to the co-accused were counter-balanced by the following factors present in the accused’s case: (a) the accused’s own heavier involvement; (b) that the accused had pleaded guilty only mid-way during trial; and (c) that the accused has not made any restitution to date.

20     Based on the above, the Prosecution was thus of the view that the accused and co-accused were to be viewed as equally complicit, and parity in sentencing would dictate that the accused’s sentence ought at the very least be equivalent with the co-accused.

### Mitigation

21     In mitigation, the Defence raised the following personal circumstances of the accused:

> (a)     At the material time of the incident, the accused had accumulated large debts notwithstanding that he was in stable employment earning an annual income of more than $100,000.

> (b)     The accused committed the offence in a desperate attempt to pay back his creditors, as he was unable to bear their non-stop harassment. The creditors had threatened to go to the accused’s workplace to harass him. Due to his circumstances, the accused used the money given by the victim and used it to gamble in desperate need to settle his debts.

> (c)     The accused is generally remorseful of his actions.

### Defence’s submissions on sentence

22     The Defence submitted for a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment, relying on the sentencing benchmarks set out at \[81\] of the District Court decision of _Public Prosecutor v Husniyati binte Omar_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 255</span> (“_Husniyati_”). In _Husniyati_, the sentencing benchmark for amounts ranging from $10,001 to $50,000 was in the range of six to 15 months’ imprisonment. Accordingly, the Defence submitted that a sentence of not more than ten months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the proceeded charge, which involved $35,000.

23     The Defence further submitted that the principle of parity should not apply in the given circumstance because the co-accused had cheated the same victim on multiple occasions. Accordingly, the co-accused’s case “ought to amount to a higher degree of aggravating factor”, resulting in “an uplift from the starting position”. In contrast, the accused was involved in only one incident. While the term of 16 months’ imprisonment would have been appropriate in the co-accused’s circumstances, it would not be so in the accused’s case “purely because it was only a one-off incident in relation to \[the victim\].” In the premises, a 16-month imprisonment term would be “unduly proportionate to what \[the accused\] has done”.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

### Decision on sentence

24     The offence under s 420 of the PC attracts a mandatory imprisonment term of up to ten years, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine.

#### Principle of parity in sentencing

25     Given that the co-accused had earlier been sentenced for his abetment of the same offence that is currently before this court, I was of the view that the principle of parity in sentencing would have to be considered in coming to the appropriate sentence for the accused. As was highlighted by the Prosecution (and from the documents annexed to the statement of facts), the co-accused was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment for his abetment of the accused.

26     In _Public Prosecutor v Ramlee and anor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 95</span>, the High Court held that sentences to be passed on offenders involved in the same offence should be the same, unless there is a difference in culpability or personal circumstances (at \[7\]):

> Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances: see _Archbold_ (1998), para 5-153. An offender who has received a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of appeal if the disparity is serious.

27     The need for there to be consistency in sentencing is “rooted in the notion that all are equal before the law” (_Chong Han Rui_ at \[1\]) and the “crucial consideration in considering the application of the parity principle is not whether the accused feels aggrieved that a co-accused person has been treated more leniently, but whether the public, with knowledge of the various sentences, would perceive that the appellant had suffered injustice” (_Chong Han Rui_ at \[47\]).

28     The Defence’s main objection to the imposition of the same sentence on the accused appeared to be that the co-accused was more culpable. The co-accused had cheated the victim on several occasions, whereas the accused had only cheated the victim on this one occasion. The Defence submitted that this meant that the accused was less culpable, and accordingly a sentence lower than the co-accused’s sentence of 16 months would be warranted for the accused.

29     Having reviewed the circumstances of the present case, as well as the relevant material relating to the sentence meted out in the co-accused’s case as contained at Annexes A to D of the statement of facts, I was unable to agree with the Defence’s submissions. My reasons are explained below.

##### (1)   Parity where the accused and co-accused face a different number of charges

30     The co-accused faced a total of 13 charges, of which 11 involved cheating of the victim (_ie_, Soh Chey Hean) under s 420 of the PC. Of the remaining two, one was a forgery charge involving the same victim Soh, and the other related to a separate incident of cheating by impersonation against a different victim (“s 419 Charge”). There were six proceeded charges, which included five cheating charges against the victim and the one s 419 Charge. The details of the six proceeded charges in relation to the co-accused are set out below:

31     As regards the seven charges which were taken into consideration in the co-accused’s matter, six related to cheating of the victim Soh under s 420 of the PC, and one was a forgery charge involving the same victim.

32     The total sentence imposed on the co-accused was 30 months’ imprisonment.

33     As the Defence highlighted, the co-accused had cheated the victim over multiple occasions. However, more charges were also tendered and proceeded with against the co-accused to reflect this fact. It was not a situation where there had only been one charge proceeded with against the co-accused, but the surrounding facts revealed that the co-accused had cheated the victim for a larger amount and for a longer period. If that were so, the Defence’s argument that the present accused should be given a sentence less than the co-accused would have had greater force.

34     Where co-offenders were charged with a different number of offences, a disparity in sentencing could be defensible if it were due to the application of the totality principle (see Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (2nd Ed, Academy Publishing, 2019) at \[12.063\]). In _Public Prosecutor v Hirris anak Martin_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 976</span> (“_Hirris_”), the court observed that a judge could decide to impose lower sentences on one co-offender who had pleaded guilty to more charges as compared to another who had pleaded guilty to fewer charges, on the basis of the totality principle (at \[21\]):

> It was, of course, possible for the Judge to give effect to the totality principle by lowering the second respondent’s sentence for the common charge and ordering it to run consecutively with the sentence for the second charge. This would give rise to the disparity of the second respondent being punished less than the first respondent for the first offence, but this disparity could still be justified on the totality principle. In _PP v McCrea Michael_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 3 SLR(R) 677</span> (‘_McCrea Michael_’), the accused pleaded guilty to two charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(_b_) of the Penal Code, and one charge of causing the disappearance of evidence with the intention of screening himself from legal punishment under s 201 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment for each of the s 304(_b_) offences and four years’ imprisonment for the s 201 offence, with all three sentences to run consecutively. In earlier proceedings, the accused’s accomplice had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 201 and was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for each of the two charges. The High Court noted this disparity but justified it on the basis of the totality principle, since the accused in _McCrea Michael_ was facing two additional charges under s 304(_b_). Similarly here, the Judge could have given effect to the totality principle by adjusting the individual sentences to arrive at an appropriate overall sentence instead of simply ordering them to run concurrently.

35     A similar observation was made in the case of _BPH_, which was cited by the Prosecution in relation to the approach to be taken when looking at precedent cases involving multiple charges. It should be noted, however, that _BPH_ was commenting on the reliance on precedents generally, and not specifically in the context of the principle of parity (at \[83\] of _BPH_):

> … it must be borne in mind when looking at precedents which involved multiple charges that the sentence for each charge could have been calibrated downwards to ensure that the court arrived at a proportionate aggregate sentence. It would therefore not be appropriate to look at the sentences imposed for the individual charges without taking into account the resulting overall sentence.

36     Based on the court’s observations in _Hirris_ and _BPH_, and given that there had been more proceeded charges in the co-accused’s case than in the present, this court has to be careful to consider that the co-accused’s sentence of 16 months for the same offending act could have been _lower_ than it should otherwise have been, due to the application of the totality principle.

37     In the co-accused’s case, the court appeared to have calibrated each proceeded charge having regard to, among others, the amount involved. The court then arrived at the total sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment by ordering two sentences to run consecutively, with the remaining four to run concurrently. I did not think that any adjustments were warranted to the 16-month sentence arising from the application of the totality principle _per se_ in the co-accused’s case as compared to the present case.

##### (2)   Relative culpabilities of the accused and co-accused

38     I next turned to consider the relative culpabilities of the accused and the co-accused in relation to the incident which was the subject of the proceeded charge.

39     I was of the view that the levels of culpability of the accused and co-accused in relation to the proceeded charge were comparable and that they were equally culpable in cheating the victim of the $35,000. The accused and co-accused acted in concert. They met the victim together on 15 October 2017 under the pretext of discussing the repayment of the monies that the co-accused owed the victim. Upon meeting, the accused showed the victim a picture of a baby with some tubes attached and told the victim that the baby in the picture was his son. The accused also showed the victim a newspaper article featuring his family including his son. The accused then falsely represented to the victim that he needed money for his son’s medical bills. During the conversation, the co-accused chimed in and corroborated the accused’s lies. Together, the accused and co-accused pressured the victim, who eventually gave in and transferred the sum of $35,000 to the accused.

40     The Defence submitted that the co-accused was more culpable as the co-accused had cheated the same victim on multiple occasions, whilst it was a “one-off incident” in relation to the victim for the accused. I first noted that it was not quite accurate for the Defence to categorise it as a “one-off incident” for the accused. There were two charges which were taken into consideration in the present case, for which one related to the accused’s abetment of the co-accused to cheat the victim, Soh.

41     In any event, and as discussed at paragraph 33 above, while the co-accused had cheated the victim over multiple occasions, there were also more charges proffered against the co-accused and subsequently proceeded with in the co-accused’s case. The court in the co-accused’s case considered the multiple proceeded charges and calibrated the sentence for each proceeded charge accordingly.

42     In light of the above, I similarly did not see any reason to make any adjustments downwards to the co-accused’s sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment on the basis of any differences in the levels of culpability between the accused and the co-accused.

##### (3)   Differences in the circumstances of the offence

43     I next dealt with the differences in the circumstances of the offender and the offence as between the accused and the co-accused.

44     First, the Prosecution highlighted that the co-accused had pleaded guilty, whereas the accused had only pleaded guilty only mid-way through trial, thereby diminishing any mitigating value to be accorded to a claim of genuine remorse.

45     Second, the Prosecution raised that the accused had taken a larger share of the cheated monies than the co-accused. Out of the $35,000, the accused took $17,710 and the co-accused took $17,290.

46     Third, the Prosecution submitted that the while the co-accused had made restitution of $2,000 (in total across the co-accused’s six proceeded charges), the accused has not made any restitution to date.

47     To my mind, these differences were not so significant as to warrant any adjustments from the sentence that was imposed on the co-accused. In any event, even if I were wrong, it should be noted that the above factors would typically be aggravating factors and would go towards adjusting the sentence _upwards_ rather than downwards.

#### Sentence is appropriate having regard to the circumstances

48     Finally, and quite apart from the principle of parity, I was satisfied that that a sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment was appropriate in the circumstances.

49     The Defence relied on the District Court decision of _Husniyati_ in submitting that a sentence of ten months would be appropriate for the cheated sum of $35,000 in this case. This was based on the observation of the court in _Husniyati_ that, “\[h\]aving considered the sentencing precedents submitted by parties … where the benefit/loss is in the range of $10,001 to $50,000, the sentencing benchmark should be in the range of 6 to 15 months” (at \[81\]). However, the court had also commented in a later paragraph that these were “mere guidelines and sentence cannot be computed just by looking at the value only. We will need to look at all the circumstances and the facts of the case as well as the accused’s personal circumstances before we can determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed” (at \[83\]).

50     In considering “all the circumstances and the facts of the case”, I found the following factors relevant in coming to my sentence:

> (a)     There was careful planning and premeditation in this case. The accused had taken deliberate steps to bolster his false representation that he required the money for his son’s medical bills by preparing the newspaper article of his family and a photo of a sick baby. These were showed to the victim to deceive him into believing that the accused required the money for the accused’s son’s medical bills.

> (b)     The amount that was cheated of the victim was significant, at $35,000.

> (c)     No restitution was made by the accused.

> (d)     The accused and co-accused had collectively pressured the victim into transferring the sum of $35,000 to the accused. While the victim had initially been reluctant to transfer the money, he eventually gave in when the accused and co-accused continued to pressure him.

> (e)     While the accused pleaded guilty, he had only elected to do so after two days of trial.

## Conclusion

51     All considered, I imposed a sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment on the accused. I was of the view that this would both be in line with the parity principle and appropriate in the circumstances of the case.
