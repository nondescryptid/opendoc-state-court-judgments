27 March 2020

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Part I   Introduction

1       The Accused was tried before me on the following charges:

> (i)     36 counts of corruptly receiving various sums of monetary gratification from one Tan Hock Chye (“PW4”) covering April 2016 to August 2009, which are offences punishable under Section 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (hereinafter referred to collectively as “the Corruption charges”); and

> (ii)     One count of concealing a sum of S$50,000 in cash for which he had reasonable grounds to believe that the said sum in whole or in part directly represents PW4’s benefits from criminal conduct. This is an offence under Section 47(2)(a) of the of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the CDSA”), and punishable under Section 47(6) of the CDSA (hereinafter referred to as the CDSA charge).

2       At the close of the prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has adduced some evidence that were not inherently incredible to satisfy each and every element of the Corruption charges. I then called upon the Accused to enter his defence. The Accused elected to give evidence in his defence after the standard allocution has been administered to him.

3       At the close of the prosecution’s case, I held that the Prosecution has failed to make out a _prima facie_ case against the Accused on the CDSA charge. Accordingly, I ordered a discharge amounting to an acquittal on the CDSA charge.

4       The Prosecution was dissatisfied with the acquittal of the Accused on the CDSA charge, and filed an appeal against his acquittal. The Prosecution applied for a stay of the proceedings to await the outcome of the appeal. I granted the application.

5       The Accused has been on bail for the Corruption charges. I made no change to the said bail. The Accused remains on bail.

6       I shall now provide my reasons behind my decision to acquit the Accused on the CDSA charge.

## Part II   Case for the Prosecution

### A   Statement of Agreed Facts

7       The undisputed facts, obtained from the Statement of Agreed Facts (“SOAF”) (see Exhibit D) are:

> (1)     At the material time, i.e. in 2005 to August 2009, the Accused was the Manager of a transport firm named Splendid Service and Supply (“Splendid”).

> (2)     During the same period, PW4, also known as Dean, was the Sales Manager at an international freight forwarding firm known as Worldgate Express Line Pte Ltd (“Worldgate”). One of Worldgate’s customers is NTN Bearing Singapore Pte Ltd (“NTN”). PW4 was in-charge of the NTN account.

> (3)     In order to transport its ball bearings for international shipment, NTN engaged Splendid for several years to transport NTN’s cargo to freight forwarders such as Worldgate. It was through this commercial activity that PW4 and the Accused became acquainted with one another.

> (4)     Sometime in 2005, PW4 proposed to his Managing Director, one Lim Chong Beng Ivan (“PW5”) that Worldgate would pay commissions to the Accused. PW5 agreed with the proposal. Thereafter, PW5 and the Accused met several times and PW5 agreed that the Accused would receive commission from Worldgate for increasing business between Worldgate and NTN (“the Commission Agreement”).

> (5)     Pursuant to the Commission Agreement, on 15 occasions between April 2006 and May 2007, and on one occasion in September 2009, Worldgate issued tax credit notes in the name of Splendid which reflected that “handling and commission payments” were being made to Splendid. Worldgate also issued payment requisition forms for these payments. The Accused signed on these payment requisition forms.

> (6)     Documentary exhibits corresponding to each of the 16 payments in \[7(5)\] were adduced and admitted. (See Exhibit P1: pages 1 to 16).

> (7)     Sometime in 2007, the Accused informed PW4 that he wanted to discontinue using Splendid to receive the commissions, and requested PW4 to issue the payment requisition forms in the name of Deili Hang Trading and Transportation (“Deili”) instead. PW4 proposed this to PW5 who agreed with the proposal to make the payments to Deili.

> (8)     Pursuant to the Commission Agreement, on 20 occasions between November 2007 and December 2009, Worldgate issued tax credit notes in the name of Deili, which reflected that “sales commission” payments were being made by Worldgate to Deili. Worldgate also issued payment requisition forms for these payments.

> (9)     PW4 would pass the payment requisition forms to the Accused, together with a cash sum of 5% of the sum stated on the form. The Accused would the hand the forms and the money to one Wong Yoke Chit Peggy (“PW3”), the General Manager of Deili. PW3 would sign the forms to reflect that Deili was receiving such payments, when in fact Deili was only receiving 5% of the sum stated on each of the payment requisition forms.

> (10)     Documentary exhibits corresponding to each of the 20 payments in \[7(9)\] were adduced and admitted. (See Exhibit P1: pages 17 to 36).

> (11)     PW4 and the Accused opened two joint bank accounts. The details of the two joint bank accounts are :

>> (a)       Citibank Joint Account : XXX (“Citibank Joint Account”)

>> The statements of the Citibank Joint Account for the period August 2005 to March 2011 were adduced and admitted as Exhibit P2.

>> (a)       UOB Joint Account : XXX (“UOB Joint Account”)

>> The statements of the UOB Joint Account for the period May 2008 to January 2011 were adduced and admitted as Exhibit P3.

> (12)     The Accused closed the UOB Joint Account on 6 January 2011 and transferred its entire balance of S$73,341.49 to a UOB account XXX. Subsequently, the Accused withdrew a cash sum of S$50,000 from UOB account XXX. The Accused passed the S$50,000 cash to his son, one Yeo Leng Chwee and informed his son that the money belonged to PW4. Yeo Leng Chwee kept the S$50,000 cash in his house.

8       The Prosecution adduced five investigation statements of the Accused as part of its case. These five investigation statements were admitted into evidence as :

> (1)      Exhibit P4 – Statement of the Accused recorded on 5 January 2011;

> (2)      Exhibit P5 – Statement of the Accused recorded on 15 March 2011;

> (3)      Exhibit P6 – Statement of the Accused recorded on 28 June 2012;

> (4)      Exhibit P7 – Statement of the Accused recorded on 12 December 2013; and

> (5)      Exhibit P8 – Statement of the Accused recorded on 12 January 2018

> (See \[34\] below for the material portions of the Accused’s investigation statements.)

9       The Prosecution also adduced the conviction records of PW4 (see Exhibit P9 – Certificate under section 45A of the Evidence Act (Chapter 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”) pertaining to PW4’s conviction on 49 cheating charges that have arisen from the Commission Agreement. In gist, PW4 had cheated Worldgate by dishonestly concealing from PW5 that the commissions which Worldgate were to pay to the Accused would in fact be retained by him. PW4 was sentenced to a total of 60 months’ imprisonment.

### B   Testimonies by Prosecution Witnesses

10     In addition to the abovementioned evidence, the Prosecution called five witnesses to give oral testimonies.

11     PW1 is Jeremy Goh, a former Investigation Officer with the Corrupt Practice Investigations Bureau (“CPIB”). PW2 is Tan Jun Kiat, a serving Investigation Officer with the CPIB. Their oral testimonies pertained mainly to their interaction with the Accused during the recording of the investigation statements of the Accused.

12     PW3 is Wong Yoke Chit Peggy. PW5 is Lim Chong Beng Ivan. The gist of their respective evidence is consistent with the SOAF – see \[7(4)\] to \[7(10)\] above.

### C   PW4 – Tan Hock Chye @ Ivan

13     The salient parts of PW4’s testimony are as follows:

> (1)     PW4 and the Accused came to know each other in 2003. PW4 joined Worldgate in 2005 and he was assigned to handle the NTN account. By servicing the NTN account, PW4 was re-acquainted with the Accused.

> (2)     One of PW4’s responsibilities was to increase the business volume from NTN to Worldgate. PW4 then facilitated several meetings among himself, PW5 and the Accused which then led to the making of the Commission Agreement (see \[7(4)\] above.) To re-cap, NTN had engaged Splendid (owned by the Accused) for several years to transport NTN’s cargo to freight forwarders such as Worldgate.

> (3)     PW4 could not remember the details of the discussion between PW5 and the Accused that led to the making of the Commission Agreement. According to PW4, PW5 had acknowledged that there was a threefold increase in business volume after the Commission Agreement was made.

> (4)     According to PW4, the payment made by Worldgate was for the Accused. After the payment requisition forms have been signed by the Accused, PW4 would collect the cheque. He would then encash the cheque with the Accused’s permission. The Accused allowed PW4 to keep the money. PW4 explained that the Accused was helping him to overcome his financial difficulties. PW4 did not see anything wrong in taking the Accused’s money. PW4’s evidence was : “_So I don’t see anything wrong. So, in fact, in return sometimes I give him a few hundred, sometimes 1,000, sometimes 2,000, sometimes he won’t even take, that’s why I set up the account and I want to give it back, the money to him_.”

> (5)     In November 2007, the payment requisition form was issued in the name of Deili, instead of Splendid. This change was made at the request of the Accused and PW5 agreed to it. According to PW4, even with the change of name of payee on the payment requisition form, the commissions were still meant for the Accused. PW4 would encash the cheque made out in the name of Deili. PW4 would then give the money and the payment requisition form to the Accused. Invariably, the Accused would tell PW4 to keep the money, which PW4 did. The Accused would take the payment requisition form and get Deili to sign on it. The Accused would then return the signed payment requisition form to PW4. For its role in this scheme, Deili would receive 5% of the sum reflected in each payment requisition form.

> (6)     PW4 did not dispute that he had opened two joint accounts with the Accused. One joint account was with Citibank and the other was with UOB. PW4 also testified that he was the one who would deposit the money into the accounts. PW4 believed that he had told the Accused to withdraw all the money from the UOB joint account although he could not be sure. PW4 was afraid that the CPIB would freeze the accounts.

> (7)     PW4 has always maintained that the commission payments were the Accused’s money and the Accused could do whatever he had wanted with his money, including giving the money to him.

14     The Prosecution applied to cross-examine and impeach the credit of PW4 with his previous statements. I allowed the application. Three investigation statements of PW4 were admitted into evidence and used by the Prosecution to cross-examine PW4. The material portions of PW4’s investigation statements are set out below:

> (i)     Exhibit P13 (recorded on 14 March 2011)

> 133    … … when I approached \[the Accused\] to ask him for his help, I did not tell him that it was a referral fee. Instead, I told him that it was meant as my commission and that my boss (\[PW5\] refers) needed the commission to be paid to a company. I did not tell \[the Accused\] that I will give him the money for his help. … …

> 134    … … Personally, I did not suggest any payment of money to him then because I did not want to offend him. The first time that I gave him a sum of money of S$500 to S$2200, for helping me when I first received the payouts from Worldgate. I had given him the money as a token of appreciation for helping me to acknowledge receipt of the payment.

> (ii)   Exhibit P11 (recorded on 15 March 2011)

> 8    Sometime in 2005, I met \[the Accused\] and told him that I needed a company to credit my commission to. …. The payment requisition form would be issued to Splendid and all that he needed to do was to sign on the payment requisition form

> 11    … … I would usually meet him at the coffeeshop of our convenience and will give him his token of appreciation, in the range of few hundreds to about S$2000/- plus, for helping me sign on the Payment Requisition form as well as for using his Splendid Services name on the forms.

> 12    … … I then asked him to help me find another company and he managed to get Deili Hang. … …

> 15    As a token of appreciation for their help, I decided to give 5% of the total amount on the payment requisition form for each of the payments to Deili Hang. … …

> (iii)   Exhibit P12 (recorded on 25 July 2012)

> 39    … … I gave him these sums of monies as a token of appreciation for allowing me to use his company’s name Splendid Services as the recipient of this commission payments. … …

> 42    … … For Splendid Services, I only gave \[the Accused\] a sum of money on and off, as a token of appreciation. … …

> 44.    … … I wish to add that the amount which I gave \[the Accused\] is not fixed but it usually ranges from a few hundred dollars to a few thousands. At the moment, I cannot recall how many times I had given \[the Accused\] money. If I recall correctly, each time, the maximum sum which I gave \[the Accused\] did not exceed $2000. I gave him this money as a token of appreciation for allowing me to use his company’s name as recipient of this commission payment. … …

> 53    Q2 : Why did you not tell your boss that you wanted this sum of commission payments for yourself and choose to go through all the trouble to get these monies ?

> 54    A2 : I think that my boss will not be agreeable for me to take this sum of commission payments for sure. My salary that I am entitled to is negligible and I needed the money with my family liabilities.

### D   Other evidence

15     The Prosecution further adduced the Grounds of Decision (see Exhibit F : **_Public Prosecutor v Tan Hock Chye @ Dean_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 295</span>) of the trial judge who has convicted PW4.

16     PW4 has appealed against his conviction and sentence on the 49 cheating charges. PW4’s appeal was dismissed by the High Court. See Exhibit P10 – Certificate of Result of Appeal for Magistrate’s Appeal No. 53/2016/01.

### E   Grounds of Decision for Disposal Inquiry 900011/2018

17     Separately, after the conclusion of the criminal case against PW4, a Disposal Inquiry (Disposal Inquiry 900011/2018) was held wherein the prosecution sought an order from the trial judge to forfeit a sum of S$50,000/- to the State. Incidentally, the said sum of S$50,000/- is the same subject matter in the present CDSA charge.

18     At the said Disposal Inquiry, the trial judge ordered the forfeiture of said sum of S$50,000/- to the State. The Accused, who was a party at the said Disposal Inquiry, appealed against the order of forfeiture. At the appeal hearing on 30 August 2019, at 10:00 a.m., the High Court dismissed the Accused’s appeal against the order of forfeiture. On the same day, at 4:00 pm, the High Court reversed its decision. The High Court set aside the order of forfeiture made by the trial judge. Having regard to section 370(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“Criminal Procedure Code”), the disposal inquiry for all the monies seized in the course of the investigation into the matter of the alleged commission paid out by Worldgate was to be held at the conclusion of the trial against the Accused. See Exhibit G : Certificate of Result of Appeal for Magistrate’s Appeal No. 9076/2019/01.

19     During the course of the prosecution’s case in the present trial, the Prosecution applied to admit into evidence the Grounds of Decision of the trial judge for the said Disposal Inquiry. The said Grounds of Decision is reported as **_Public Prosecutor v Yeo Kong Meow_** <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 92</span> (hereinafter referred to as “the DI GD”). The Prosecution sought the admission of the DI GD under section 45A(5) of the Evidence Act ( “s 45A(5) EA”).

20     S 45A(5) EA is reproduced below :

> (5) Where relevant, any document containing details of the information, complaint, charge, agreed state of facts or record of proceedings on which the person in question is convicted shall be admissible in evidence.

21     The Prosecution argued that the DI GD comes within the phrase “any document containing details of the information” or “record of proceedings” in S 45A(5) EA. The Prosecution also argued that the DI GD was “_relevant because it specifically makes reference to the conviction of \[PW4\] and clarifies certain findings_.”

22     The Defence objected to the admission of the DI GD on three grounds. Firstly, PW4’s criminal trial and the Disposal Inquiry dealt with issues and offences that were wholly different from the charges faced by the Accused. The DI GD is therefore irrelevant to the present case. Secondly, the DI GD is not a document containing details of information or recording of proceeding on which PW4’s was convicted. My understanding of the defence’s second argument was that the DI GD did not deal with the issues of guilt and conviction for these issues have already been determined in the criminal trial. It follows that therefore, it is the grounds of decision of PW4’s criminal trial (i.e. Exhibit F) that comes within the ambit of s 45A(5) EA. Thirdly, the order of forfeiture of the trial judge in the Disposal Inquiry has been overturned on appeal.

23     In reply, the Prosecution submitted that the Corruption charges in the present case are to a large extent, predicated on PW4’s cheating charges. The Corruption charges relate to the receipt of monies of gratification paid for signing on the requisition forms. Although the High Court has reversed the trial judge’s order of forfeiture, there was no express overruling of the findings of fact. The Prosecution then added that in respect of the DI GD, the Prosecution was confining it to the paragraph \[within the DI GD\] that is relevant to clarifying the grounds of PW4’s conviction.

24     After hearing parties submissions, I ruled that the DI GD was not admissible. At the trial, I did not state my reasons, which led to further arguments (see \[25\] below). I shall now give my reasons and they are :

> (i)     The conviction of PW4 was already established at PW4’s criminal trial and that conviction was affirmed on appeal. The Disposal Inquiry was an ancillary hearing following from that conviction. I found myself in agreement with the defence’s argument that the DI GD does not come within the ambit of s 45A(5) EA.

> (ii)     The order of forfeiture was reversed on appeal. It is therefore unsafe to rely on the DI GD. Section 45A EA deals with the relevance of conviction and acquittals. A conviction is relevant and admissible **_unless_** it has been quashed or set-aside : see s 45A(2)(b) EA. In my judgment, as a matter of legal principle, the approach in the said sub-section is equally applicable in respect of the DI GD.

25     After I had given my ruling on the DI GD, I gave leave to the Prosecution to raise further arguments. The Prosecution’s submission was that the criminal trial grounds of decision (i.e. Exhibit F : **_Public Prosecutor v Tan Hock Chye @ Dean_**) were not entirely clear, which was why the trial judge clarified the grounds of decision in the DI GD. In particular, the Prosecution submitted that the trial judge’s grounds at \[59\] of Exhibit F : **_Public Prosecutor v Tan Hock Chye @ Dean_** did not quite describe the scheme used by PW4 to siphon the monies given based on the Commission Agreement to himself and not to the Accused. The Prosecution pointed out that \[14\] of the DI GD provided the clarification for the basis of PW4’s conviction. In the words of the Prosecution, “_\[The DI GD\] covers up the holes that are in the previous GD_.”

26     I was not persuaded by the Prosecution’s further submissions. Whatever “holes” that might have been perceived by the Prosecution in respect of the trial judge’s grounds ((i.e. Exhibit F : **_Public Prosecutor v Tan Hock Chye @ Dean_**), it is a fact that the trial judge’s conviction of PW4 was upheld on appeal. That, in my judgment, brought an end, a finality, to PW4’s criminal matter. For the purposes of proving PW4’s conviction, the relevant evidence are therefore Exhibit P9, Exhibit P10 and Exhibit F.

27     In its further submissions, the Prosecution brought to my attention the Court of Appeal’s (“CA”) decision in **_Chua Boon Chye v Public Prosecutor_** \[2015\] 4 SLR 923 (“**_Chua Boon Chye_**”) (see Exhibit H). The **_Chua Boon Chye_**, the CA was asked to determine a question of law of public interest : “Whether the previous conviction of a third party is admissible as evidence against the accused in criminal proceedings.” The relevant statutory provision involved was section 45A EA. The CA held that the language of s 45A EA was general inasmuch as it drew no distinction between civil proceedings on the one hand and criminal proceedings on the other. Unless expressly stated otherwise, s 45A EA applied to both civil and criminal proceedings. The question was thus answered in the affirmative.

28     The CA in **_Chua Boon Chye_** was aware that while there could be potential risks to a fair trial in admitting evidence of third party convictions in later criminal proceedings, safeguards could be put in place to ensure that the accused would not be duly prejudiced. On this note, I would like to highlight the following paragraph of the CA’s decision in **_Chua Boon Chye_**:

> 72    …… we find the following propositions laid out by the English Court of Appeal in _R v Boyson_ \[1991\] Crim LR 274 (“_Boyson_”) to be instructive:

>> (a)    ……

>> (b)     **_Secondly, the judge concerned should consider s 78 of the 1984 UK Act and direct his or her mind as to whether the probative value of the conviction outweighs the prejudicial value._** Singapore has no statutory equivalent of s 78, but this court, in Muhammad bin Kadar v PP <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span>, has made it clear that the Singapore courts have a similar _discretion_ under common law.

> (Emphasis in bold is made by this court)

29     Even if I was wrong in my initial ruling (see \[24\] above), there was an alternative ground for not admitting the DI GD into evidence. In my assessment, the prejudicial value of the DI GD outweighs the probative. I shall now proceed to show where the prejudice could be found in the DI GD.

30     In the DI GD, the trial judge has reproduced the background facts provided by the prosecution as follows:

> 4    The background facts were adequately set out the in the Public Prosecutor’s Application, and which was reproduced below –

> 5.    During the course of the investigations, \[Dean\] confirmed the following in his statement to the CPIB which was admitted by consent into evidence at the trial and marked as **P171** : …

>> a.     **He had deposited some of his proceeds of crime into two joint accounts** with PW1 Yeo including the UOB joint account with Yeo,

>> b.    He asked \[the Accused\] to withdraw money from the UOB joint account and to safeguard this for him.

>> (Emphasis in bold is made by this court)

31     The said Dean referred to in the extract reproduced at \[30\] is PW4 in this present case. PW4’s investigation statement (i.e. **P171**) was admitted in evidence in the present case as Exhibit P11. The relevant portions of his statement are reproduced below:

> 32    I also placed some of the money in the joint accounts that I have with Yeo. I have 2 joint accounts with Yeo under Citibank and UOB. I am not able to remember the account number and the branch where the account was opened. I was the one who initiated the idea to have the joint account because of my gambling habits as well as to use the accounts for investment purposes. I am confident that Yeo will not run with my money because he is already in his 60s and have a family and business here.

> 33    The Citibank account is still in existence and there is about S$2,000/- plus in that account. As for the UOB account, it was closed either sometime this year or last year. The reason for closing the account was because CPIB had conducted investigations and as I was afraid that the bank account would be freeze, I asked Yeo to safeguard the money in cash. I had asked him to close the account and he is now holding on to about S$70,000/- to S$80,000/-. However, I am not certain of the amount. The purpose is to meet my future daily expenses due to the shortfall in the payment from Worldgate on the referral fee to Yield Services.

32     Upon a careful comparison of PW4’s statement (i.e. Exhibit P11) with the background facts presented for the Disposal Inquiry, it was clear to this court that there have been embellishment and wrong characterisation of the facts in the latter. In particular, there wasn’t any reference to any proceeds of crime from the above two paragraphs of PW4’s statement.

33     For the reasons stated in \[24\] and \[26\] to \[32\] above, I maintained my decision not to admit the DI GD into evidence.

### F   Material portions of the Accused’s investigation statements

34     At \[8\] above, I have mentioned that the Prosecution have admitted four of the Accused’s investigation statements as part of its case. The material portions of the Accused’s investigation statement are set out below:

> (i)     Exhibit P4 (recorded on 5 January 2011)

> 5    … … I wish to state that the places where we will meet are usually determined by \[PW4\] and the cash I received from \[PW4\] varies in amount. It can range from a few hundreds to a few thousands Singapore dollars. I wish to state that this “practice” happened a few years back and it is still continuing even till now. I did asked \[PW4\] on the first occasion why he passed me cash. He claimed that the cash are commission for me and told me just to take it. I did not ask him further and I just took the money from him. I believe that \[PW4\] gives me the commission as I always made prompt payment to \[Worldgate\] on behalf of NTN. …

> (ii)   Exhibit P5 (recorded on 15 March 2011)

> Q1    Why did you agree to open the UOB account with \[PW4\] ?

> A1    …. … he insisted to open the UOB account with me. I do not know why. Maybe he trusted me a lot. \[PW4\] told me that the amount in this account was for investment purposes ad he would give me some the dividends to be received in future. He did not tell me the exact amount he would give to me. … …

> … …

> Q3    Did you close the UOB joint account because of this CPIB investigation ?

> A3.    No. I honestly wanted to return the money inside the account to \[PW4\].

> Q4    Was the UOB joint account opened for you to receive the commission from Worldgate ?

> A4    I do not know

> Q5    Was the money in the UOB joint account the commission you received from Dean from Worldgate?

> A5    I do not know.

> Q6    Did you ever discuss with \[PW5\] of Worldgate of you receiving the commission ?

> A6    … … \[PW5\] told me that the commission I received was perfectly fine as long as the Worldgate payment vouchers stating the commission was issued to Splendid. From what I know, \[PW$\] received the commission from Worldgate and instructed me to sign the Worldgate payment vouchers stating the commissions. Quite oftenly, \[PW4\] gave me a few hundred to a few thousand dollars as a token of appreciation for signing the payment vouchers. … …

> (iii)   Exhibit P6 (recorded on 28 June 2012)

> Q3    What was the purpose of \[PW4\] giving commissions to you ?

> A3    It was given to me in return for me helping Dean to sign the payment vouchers. … …

> (iv)   Exhibit P7 (recorded on 12 December 2013)

> 38    … I wish to say that I remember that I had opened a joint account with \[PW4\] some years back. … … but I remember that I had since closed the UOB account as CPIB is conducting investigations on us and the money does not belong to me, hence I decided to closed the account and return the money to \[PW4\]. I remember that when I closed down the UOB account, there was still S$50,000 inside the account. I wish to say that I can remember that \[PW4\] approached me and told me that he wants to open a joint account with me. He then told me that he would put money in this joint account and that the monies in this bank account is meant for his investment. … …

> 39    After I closed down the bank account, I called \[PW4\] and told him that I had closed down the UOB account and that the money is with me. I asked him to take back his money. However, \[PW4\] refused and asked me to help safekeep his money. … …

## Part III   Assessment of the Evidence

35     To re-cap, at the close of the Prosecution’s case, I called upon the Accused to enter his defence to the Corruption charges and I acquitted him on the CDSA charge. To address the appeal filed by the Prosecution, I shall only deal with the CDSA charge.

36     There are sufficient evidence, which are not inherently incredible, to show that PW4 had come up with a scheme that resulted in him getting the commission payments instead of the Accused or Deili. The evidence showed that PW4 kept most of the monies. He only gave token sums to the Accused. For Deili, PW4 paid 5% of the amount reflected in the payment requisition forms. The balance of the monies retained by PW4 would constitute proceeds of his crime. The issue that follows is – where did all these balance monies (i.e. the proceeds of PW4’s crime) end up?

37     The burden of proof lies on the Prosecution to show that the money kept in the UOB Joint Account were the proceeds of PW4’s crime.

38     During oral arguments at the close of the prosecution’s case, I have queried the Prosecution : _“ … … the cheque is issued in cash cheque form, it goes to the bank, from cash cheque becoming cash, where did the money go to? Has there been any evidence that the money arising from all of these invoices, all these payment requisition forms, had gone into the UOB account ?”_ In reply, the Prosecution referred the court to the Accused’s statement, namely, Exhibit P7 at amended \[38\], which I have reproduced in \[34(iv)\] of this grounds of decision. It was clear to the court that the said portion of PW4’s statement did not state that the monies that PW4 would be depositing would come from the commission payments he would be receiving. The evidence on the source of the deposit was missing.

39     The court then followed up with a further question to the Prosecution whether there were any evidence from PW4, whether from his oral testimony or from his investigation statements, to show that the commission payments went into the joint account. The Prosecution conceded that there was none.

40     It is pertinent to point out that the Accused has opened two joint account with PW4. The evidence that was led by the prosecution did not show which specific payment made by Worldgate from the various commission payments went into the Citibank Joint Account; or the UOB Joint Account; or both. PW4 was not asked specifically by the Prosecution on this issue. The relevant portion of PW4’s oral testimony under examination by the Prosecution is reproduced below (see Day 2 of the Notes of Evidence at Day 2 at page 89):

>   
| 

_DPP :_

 | 

_So one was a Citibank joint account and one was a UOB joint account; do you remember this ?_

 |
| 

_PW4 :_

 | 

_Yes._

 |
| 

_DPP :_

 | 

_Now, who deposited the money in these bank accounts ?_

 |
| 

_PW4 :_

 | 

_I deposited the money._

 |
| 

_DPP :_

 | 

_Why did you open these joint accounts ?_

 |
| 

_PW4 :_

 | 

_As I have already explained earlier, that I wanted to give the money back to \[the Accused\], but he insist, so I have no other alternative. I wanted him to take the money, so I opened a joint account with him._

 |
| 

_DPP :_

 | 

_So it was your idea to open the joint bank accounts ?_

 |
| 

_PW4 :_

 | 

_Yes, you can say that_

 |
| 

_DPP :_

 | 

_Now, the money in those joint accounts, whose money is it ?_

 |
| 

_PW4 :_

 | 

_You can take it that I wanted to give back his money, so in fact it was joint account. If \[the Accused\] wants to encash the money, any time he cab encash the money._

 |

  
  

From the above, it was my assessment that the Prosecution was merely seeking to establish the reason behind the opening of the joint accounts and the ownership of the monies therein. The Prosecution did not establish the source of the monies that were deposited into the joint accounts.

41     PW4’s investigation statements did not contain any evidence regarding the source of the monies deposited into the joint accounts.

42     Furthermore, a comparison of the amounts stated on the payment requisition forms (see Exhibit P1) reveal no logical correlation between the sums of money stated on those payment requisition forms and the amounts of monies deposited into both joint accounts over the material period of time.

43     I found that the Prosecution has failed to adduce sufficient evidence showing the chain of evidence that PW4 has obtained the monies and then put them into the UOB Joint Account.

44     During my deliberation, I was mindful of the following evidence given by PW4 (see Day 2 of the Notes of Evidence at page 105):

>   
| 

_Court :_

 | 

_So if \[the Accused\] don’t accept the money, what do you do with the money ?_

 |
| 

_PW4 :_

 | 

_I will deposit some of the money into_ **_the joint account_** _._

 |
| 

_Court :_

 | 

_Some of the money ? Not the whole money ?_

 |
| 

_PW4 :_

 | 

_No. Some of the money. In fact, he wanted me to keep all his money. So, I will put – set aside a certain amount of money to put into_ **_the joint account_** _. In fact, I wanted him to have his money._

 |
| 

(Emphasis in bold is made by this court)

 |

  
  

45     PW4’s evidence, as set out above, is equivocal. He referred to “the joint account” in the singular, and he did not specify whether “the joint account” was the Citibank Joint Account or the UOB Joint Account. The Prosecution left PW4’s evidence as it was. During oral arguments, I have specifically highlighted to the Prosecution : _“So, in a sense, shouldn't there be evidence to show that the money arising from the commission, so-called commission, goes to \[PW4\], and \[PW4\] puts it into the bank. So which bank account did \[PW4\] use? There were two joint bank accounts. The question that was posed, both in the evidence in the court and in P11, seems to be unclear.”_ The Prosecution’s reply was : “_Yes, your Honour. We would submit that this is, however, prima facie evidence which the prosecution has produced at this point, and the defence should therefore be called, and it be for the accused to answer whatever that is left remaining to be clarified in terms of evidence for this charge.”_ With due respect, the Prosecution’s reply failed to address the gap in its case that I have highlighted.

46     In its Opening Statement (see Exhibit E), at \[11\], the Prosecution has stated : _“\[s\]ometime between 2006 to 2011, while the scheme was ongoing, \[PW4\] asked the \[Accused\] to open two joint accounts in UOB and Citibank with him_, **_where \[PW4\] could keep the money he had siphoned from Worldgate_**_”._ As I have pointed out, the Prosecution has failed to adduce direct evidence to prove this fact.

47     At the close of the prosecution’s case, the Prosecution changed its approach. The Prosecution submitted there were sufficient evidence to make an inference that _“\[t\]he money in the UOB Joint Account constituted PW4’s benefits from his criminal conduct (i.e. cheating Worldgate).”_ (See Exhibit K at \[29\]). I found that the prosecution had failed to adduce _prima facie_ evidence as to the origin of the monies in the UOB and Citibank joint accounts in question. It was an element of the CDSA charge that the sum of $50,000 (which was withdrawn at some point from the UOB account), represented PW4’s benefits from cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). Given the lack of _prima facie_ evidence as to fact that the $50,000 was obtained through a criminal offence, I did not call upon the Accused to enter his defence on the CDSA charge and ordered a discharge amounting to acquittal in accordance with s 230(1)(_j_) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

## Part V   Acquittal

48     For the reasons set out in Part III of this grounds of decision, I acquitted the Accused on the CDSA charge.
