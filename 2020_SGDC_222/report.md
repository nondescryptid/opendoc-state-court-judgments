### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The Accused, Tang Wai Kit, cheated and forged to cheat on 17 different occasions. He pleaded guilty to six charges and admitted and consented to 11 other charges being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing. He was sentenced to a total imprisonment term of 84 months. The Accused appealed against the sentence imposed.

2       The Accused was sentenced as follows:

3       Pursuant to section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), in the present case, at least two of the imprisonment sentences had to be ordered to run consecutively. I ordered the sentences for the three offences as shown in the Table in \[2\] to run consecutively. The Prosecution had urged the Court to order that three of the sentences (for the twelfth, thirteenth and seventeenth charges) be ordered to run consecutively. The Defence was in apparent agreement that the sentences for the said three offences be run consecutively. Where the Prosecution and Defence differed was in the length of imprisonment to be imposed, individually, for the said three offences. All considered, I found that the individual sentences and the resultant total sentence suggested by the Prosecution to be the more appropriate position in all the circumstances of the case. The Accused was thus sentenced to a total imprisonment term of 84 months. As stated, the Accused appealed against the sentence imposed. The Accused is currently serving sentence.

4       As set out in the Statement of Facts (“SOF”), at the material times that the offences were committed, the Accused was employed as an assistant sales manager of Inabata Singapore Pte Ltd (“Inabata”).

5       As stated in paragraph \[5\] of the SOF, Inabata trades in industrial chemicals and plastic products. As an assistant sales manager with Inabata, the responsibilities of the Accused included: oversight of the company’s purchasing department for chemical products, order placement for the sale and supply of industrial chemical products to customers, arranging for delivery of the company’s products to customers and collecting customer payments for Inabata.

6       The six proceeded charges are set out in the following paragraphs, together with the respective parts of the SOF (paraphrased where necessary, but largely quoted verbatim from the SOF) that relate to the said charges.

7       The first charge (C1) stated that the Accused, on or about 10 March 2014, in Singapore, did cheat one Chieko Martinez, a sales coordinator with Inabata, to wit, by deceiving her into believing that DuPont Company (Singapore) Private Limited (“DuPont”) had ordered two pieces of production machinery from Inabata, a fact which the Accused knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, the Accused dishonestly induced the said Chieko Martinez to issue a Purchase Order and make a payment of SGD41,730 to Gim Guan Freight Private Limited (“Gim Guan”), an act she would not have done had she not been so deceived, and the Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code.

8       As set out in the SOF, on or around 10 March 2014, the Accused informed a sales coordinator employed by Inabata, the said Chieko Martinez (“Martinez”), that DuPont had ordered two pieces of production machinery from Inabata. The Accused was lying as he knew that no such order had been placed.

9       The Accused then instructed Martinez to issue a purchase order to Gim Guan, claiming that Inabata could procure the two pieces of production machinery from Gim Guan. Gim Guan would arrange for the delivery to DuPont directly. The Accused did not arrange for Gim Guan to deliver any machinery to DuPont, and was lying to Martinez about this too.

10     The Accused then informed Gim Guan (through its director, one Terence Tan Hoe Yong) that it should issue an invoice for the sum of SGD41,730 to Inabata so that Inabata would make payment to it; and the Accused would allow Gim Guan to deduct a commission of 20% before it handed the balance of the payment to him. Gim Guan issued the invoice requested by the Accused, on the assumption that it was acting as an intermediary in a transaction arranged by the Accused.

11     The Accused then submitted the invoice to Inabata through Martinez. Relying on the invoice from Gim Guan, and relying on the false representation of the Accused that Gim Guan would be supplying the two pieces of machinery to DuPont, Martinez was induced to issue a payment of SGD41,730 to Gim Guan.

12     After Gim Guan received the payment, it deducted the 20% commission promised by the Accused and handed over the remaining money in cash to the Accused. The Accused person spent the said cash on gambling.

13     Thus, the Accused did cheat Martinez by deceiving her into believing that there was a genuine purchase transaction involving DuPont (as Inabata’s customer) and Gim Guan (as Inabata’s supplier). Martinez was induced by the deceit of the Accused into issuing a payment from Inabata to Gim Guan. The Accused had thereby committed an offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing the delivery of property, punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code.

14     The second charge (C2) stated that the Accused, on or about 14 February 2014, in Singapore, did commit forgery by making a false document, to wit, a Purchase Order Number 3200080711, purportedly issued by DuPont, intending that such document shall be used for the purpose of cheating Martinez, a sales coordinator with Inabata, into believing that DuPont had made an order for machinery maintenance services, and thereby dishonestly inducing Martinez to issue a payment of USD19,500 to Gim Guan, and the Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 468 of the Penal Code.

15     As set out in the SOF, on or about 14 February 2014, the Accused informed Martinez that DuPont required some of its machinery to be maintained, a service that DuPont had previously procured from Inabata. The Accused was lying as he knew that DuPont had not requested the maintenance service on this occasion.

16     The Accused obtained a genuine purchase order (“PO”) previously issued by DuPont to Inabata for the purchase of machinery, which had a PO number 3200080711. The Accused used it as a base to create a false PO purportedly issued by DuPont to Inabata for machinery maintenance. The Accused did so by first removing the description of the purchased machinery from the original PO, and thereafter replacing it with a description of the purported service relating to machinery maintenance that DuPont had requested. The Accused submitted the forged PO to Inabata through Martinez.

17     The Accused then informed Gim Guan (through the said Terence Tan Hoe Yong) that it should issue an invoice for the sum of USD19,500 to Inabata so that Inabata would make payment to it, and that the Accused would allow Gim Guan to deduct a commission of 20% before it handed the balance of the payment to him. Gim Guan issued the invoice requested by the Accused, on the assumption that it was acting as an intermediary in a transaction arranged by the Accused.

18     The Accused then submitted the invoice to Inabata through Martinez. Relying on the invoice from Gim Guan, the forged PO from DuPont, and the false representations of the Accused about the purported transaction, Martinez was induced to issue a payment of USD19,500 (equivalent to about SGD26,910) to Gim Guan.

19     After Gim Guan received the payment, it deducted the 20% commission promised by the Accused and handed over the remaining money to the Accused by way of a cash cheque. The Accused encashed the cheque and spent the proceeds on gambling.

20     Thus, the Accused did make a false document intending that such document be used for the purpose of cheating. The Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under s 468 of the Penal Code.

21     The tenth (C10), twelfth (C12) and thirteenth (C13) charges are dealt with together in the SOF.

22     In C10, it is stated that the Accused, on or about 25 November 2014, in Singapore, did commit forgery by making a false document, to wit, by fraudulently affixing the seal of one Sumitomo Bakelite Singapore Private Limited (“Sumitomo”) onto a Delivery Order Number PG216318, issued by Euro Chemo-Pharma Sdn Bhd (“Euro Chemo-Pharma”), intending that such document shall be used for the purpose of cheating one Lim Bee Hong, a sales coordinator with Inabata, into believing that Sumitomo affixed such seal and received 220 drums of Phenol Resin 4 from Euro Chemo-Pharma, and thereby dishonestly inducing the said Lim Bee Hong to issue a payment of USD104,500 to Euro Chemo-Pharma, and the Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 468 of the Penal Code.

23     In C12, it is stated that the Accused, on or about 22 December 2014, in Singapore, did commit forgery by making a false document, to wit, by fraudulently affixing the seal of one Sumitomo onto a Delivery Order Number PG217327, purportedly issued by Euro Chemo-Pharma, intending that such document shall be used for the purpose of cheating the said Lim Bee Hong, a sales coordinator with Inabata, into believing that Sumitomo affixed such seal and received 160 drums of Phenol Resin 4 from Euro Chemo-Pharma, and thereby dishonestly inducing the said Lim Bee Hong to issue a payment of USD152,000 to Euro Chemo-Pharma, and the Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 468 of the Penal Code.

24     In C13, it is stated that the Accused, on or about 26 February 2015, in Singapore, did commit forgery by making a false document, to wit, by fraudulently affixing the seal of one Sumitomo onto a Delivery Order Number PG219704, issued by Euro Chemo-Pharma, intending that such document shall be used for the purpose of cheating the said Lim Bee Hong, a sales coordinator with Inabata, into believing that Sumitomo affixed such seal and received 180 drums of Phenol Resin 4 from Euro Chemo-Pharma, and thereby dishonestly inducing the said Lim Bee Hong to issue a payment of USD85,500 to Euro Chemo-Pharma, and the Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 468 of the Penal Code.

25     As set out in the SOF, between November 2014 and February 2015, the Accused made false representations to the said Lim Bee Hong (“Lim”), a sales coordinator with Inabata. The Accused told Lim that a customer of Inabata, namely Sumitomo, had placed orders for industrial chemical products called Phenol Resin 4 (“PR4”) from Inabata. However, no such orders had been placed.

26     The Accused contacted a director of Euro Chemo-Pharma, one Jeryl Tan, and informed him to get Euro Chemo-Pharma to issue delivery orders (“DO”) for the delivery of PR4. The Accused said that Euro Chemo-Pharma could deduct a 10% commission for the transaction upon the moneys being received by it, before paying the balance to another company, SJT Holdings Pte Ltd (“SJT”). According to the Accused, SJT was to be the supplier of Euro Chemo-Pharma.

27     The Accused then made arrangements with SJT. The Accused told SJT that it could keep a 6% commission for every transaction in which it acted as a recipient of payment from Euro Chemo-Pharma. The Accused told SJT that the supply and delivery of goods would be arranged by him separately.

28     After the DOs had been issued by Euro Chemo-Pharma, the Accused forged the DOs by affixing the company seal of Sumitomo onto the DOs. The Accused forged the DOs to make it seem like Sumitomo had accepted delivery of the goods described in the DOs. The Accused then submitted the DOs to Inabata through Lim. Lim was deceived by the forged documents and false representations of the Accused into believing that Sumitomo had made an order for the PR4 and that Euro Chemo-Pharma had fulfilled the order.

29     Lim caused Inabata to issue payments to Euro Chemo-Pharma which, after deducting the 10% commission promised to it by the Accused, paid the balance to SJT. SJT similarly deducted the 6% commission promised to it by the Accused, and issued cash cheques to the Accused. The Accused encashed the cheques and spent the proceeds on gambling.

30     The Accused used the forged DOs to cheat Lim into believing that genuine transactions had taken place involving Sumitomo and Euro Chemo-Pharma, for which Inabata was obliged to make payment. Lim was dishonestly induced into causing Inabata to make payments for these false transactions concocted by the Accused. Thus the Accused had committed three counts of forgery for the purpose of cheating punishable under s 468 of the Penal Code.

31     The seventeenth charge (C17) stated that the Accused, on or about 13 February 2015, in Singapore, did cheat one Chai Siew Cheng, director of SHH Technologies Private Limited (“SHH”), to wit, by deceiving her into believing that Euro Chemo-Pharma had placed an order of 2,500 kg of Phenol Resin 4 with Yew Hock Stevedore & Trading Private Limited (“Yew Hock”), a fact which the Accused knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, the Accused dishonestly induced the said Chai Siew Cheng to deposit SGD49,450 into an Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited bank account under the name of the wife of the Accused, one Xiong Genlin, an act the said Chai Siew Cheng would not have done had she not been so deceived, and the Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code.

32     As set out in the SOF, the said Chai Siew Cheng (“Chai”) is the director of SHH, a tool and die maker. The Accused and Chai are acquainted with each other.

33     In early February 2015, the Accused told Chai that Euro Chemo-Pharma wanted to purchase 2,500 kg of PR4 from SHH. The Accused also told Chai that he had placed an order for the PR4 with a supplier named Yew Hock. SHH was to act as the intermediary in the transaction, making payment to Yew Hock for the goods and collecting payment from Euro Chemo-Pharma. The Accused told Chai that SHH could keep a commission of 10% to 20% from the transaction.

34     The Accused then gave Chai an invoice purportedly issued by Yew Hock for the PR4 for the sum of SGD49,450. The Accused told Chai to make payment to Yew Hock by transferring funds to Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation bank account number XXX (the “OCBC Account”). The Accused led Chai to believe that the payment into the OCBC Account would reach Yew Hock, and that the PR4 would be delivered to Euro Chemo-Pharma. Chai believed that SHH would then receive payment from Euro Chemo-Pharma for the sale, enabling SHH to be paid its commission.

35     The Accused was, however, lying about the entire transaction to Chai. The Accused had not placed any order for PR4 with Yew Hock. Yew Hock did not issue the invoice which the Accused had given to Chai, and it was not aware of the purported supply of PR4 to Euro Chemo-Pharma. The Accused also did not tell Chai that the OCBC Account was in the name of the wife of the Accused, that he had control over the bank account, and that any deposit of funds into the account would not be received by Yew Hock.

36     On 13 February 2015, the victim Chai transferred SGD49,450 into the OCBC Account. The Accused withdrew all of the deposited money from the OCBC Account without his wife’s knowledge. The Accused spent all of the money on gambling.

37     The Accused cheated Chai by deceiving her into believing that there was a purchase of PR4 by Euro Chemo-Pharma, and a supply of PR4 by Yew Hock, and that he was giving SHH the opportunity to profit as the intermediary in the transaction. The victim Chai was dishonestly induced by the Accused into transferring the sum of SGD49,450 into the OCBC Account. The Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code.

38     Across all 17 charges faced by the Accused, the total losses he caused to the various victims amounted to approximately SGD1.59 million, and the total wrongful gains he had made amounted to approximately SGD1.34 million. The Accused had not made any restitution.

39     In respect of the six proceeded charges faced by the Accused, he had caused losses amounting to the approximate sum of SGD590,050, and total wrongful gains to himself in the approximate sum of SGD503,641.

40     As stated in \[3\] above, the Prosecution and the Defence (by implication) had both submitted that the sentences for C12, C13 and C17 be ordered to run consecutively. Whilst the Prosecution submitted suggested sentences for all six proceeded charges, the Defence was apparently content with only submitting suggested sentences for the said three offences. A summary of their respective submissions is given below:

41     Thus, the Prosecution were submitting that the total sentence should be 84 months. The Defence submitted that the total sentence should be 62 months.

42     After hearing the respective submissions on sentence by the Prosecution and the Defence, and after considering the Mitigation plea, I was of the view that the sentences suggested by the Prosecution for the individual charges, and the total sentence, to be more appropriate than that which had been suggested by the Defence.

43     I was in broad agreement with the Prosecution’s submission on sentence. The Prosecution had emphasised that the Accused had committed the 17 offences over a span of 16 months. The total losses amounted to a staggering SGD1.59 million approximately (the majority of these losses were suffered by Inabata, the employers of the Accused). The Accused had made wrongful gains of approximately SGD1.34 million. No restitution had been made.

44     The Prosecution submitted that in this case, the aggregate sentence was to be emphasised over a “granular approach relating to the sentence for (the) individual charges”, citing _Public Prosecutor v Koh Seah Wee_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 292</span>. I agreed that this was the correct approach.

45     The Prosecution further emphasised the “large sums involved per charge and in total”. The total losses caused for the six proceeded charges was of a large magnitude: SGD590,050, as were the total profits gained by the Accused for these six charges, at SGD503,641.

46     In this case, there were six charges proceeded with, and 11 others were to be taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. The Prosecution also pointed out that there had been a “prolonged period of offending”, and that specific deterrence was thus an important sentencing principle in this particular case. The Accused had “concocted bogus sales transactions, forged documents and paid commissions to third parties” in order to achieve his criminal gains. The Prosecution further pointed out that the fraud of the Accused had been “carefully planned” and that he had managed to avoid detection for more than a year. Pointing to the abuse of trust with regard to his own employer, it had to be borne in mind that the employer of the Accused had suffered great losses at the hands of the Accused. The Prosecution also pointed out that there were several charges of a similar nature that were to be taken into consideration.

47     The Prosecution tendered a Table of Precedents. The Prosecution calibrated their sentencing submissions largely based on the total sums involved in the cases cited. The individual sentences suggested were then calibrated accordingly with an appropriate total sentence in mind, and scaled in relation to the sums involved. I found that this approach was the most appropriate in the circumstances. The principles of general and specific deterrence had to be firmly borne in mind in coming to the appropriate individual and total sentences to be meted out.

48     In _Public Prosecutor v Jaslyn Chen Xiaohong_, the total sum involved was SGD1.25 million, of which SGD271,581 was said to have been recovered. The total sentence in that case was imprisonment for 81 months. The Prosecution pointed out that the sum involved there was less than in the present case, the method of cheating (by way of forged salary letters) was “less sophisticated” than in the present case, and there had been partial recovery in that case.

49     In _Public Prosecutor v Terence Tan Teow Boo_, the total sum involved was also lower (at SGD1.129 million) as compared to the present case, and the offender there was sentenced to a total of 75 months’ imprisonment.

50     In _Public Prosecutor v Soh Meng Yeow_, the total sum involved was SGD895,977, and the offender there was sentenced to a total of 84 months’ imprisonment.

51     The Defence, in making their submissions as to the appropriate sentences for the said three charges, chose individual sentences meted out in cases cited in the Prosecution’s Table of Precedents. This approach was not appropriate in the circumstances, as the cases cited by the Defence involved sums of a far lesser magnitude as compared to the present case, and apparently did not take into account the total sums gained by the Accused here, and total losses caused by the Accused.

52     In coming to the appropriate total sentence to be meted out, I did take into account that the Accused was untraced for any antecedent and had voluntarily surrendered. His plea of guilt would also afford the Accused some measure of discount. However, it cannot be ignored that the Accused, through his criminal acts, had caused huge losses to the various victims, and consequently, huge illegal gains flowing to his pockets. I had carefully considered the whole of the Mitigation Plea. The sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence came clearly to the fore in this case, and I was of the view that the individual sentences for the six proceeded charges, and the total sentence as submitted by the Prosecution were appropriate in all the circumstances of this case. The Accused was thus sentenced as shown in the table at \[2\], and as set out in \[2\] and \[3\].

53     Perhaps as an end note to the tale of the nefarious acts of the Accused, it should be pointed out what was submitted in \[11\] of the Mitigation Plea, where the Accused states that “he did not personally gain anything from his crime. All the ill-gotten money went to unlicensed-moneylenders and casinos due to his foolishness.” This submission appears to demonstrate a certain lack of remorse, in not recognising the huge losses that his criminal venture had caused the victims (especially Inabata) and an inappropriate and callous attitude to the largely self-inflicted losses of the undeserved riches he had illegally gained.
