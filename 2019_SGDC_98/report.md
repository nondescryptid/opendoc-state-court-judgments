Building and Construction Law – Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act – Stay of enforcement of adjudication determination

16 May 2019

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Background

1       The Plaintiff was engaged by the Defendant pursuant to a Letter of Award dated 8 March 2018 (“LOA”) as its sub-contractor for the works described as “_BUILDING WORKS AT SENGKANG N4C30: SUB-CONTRACT WORK FOR THE SUPPLY LABOUR FOR MASONRY WORK TO BLK 455B AND BLK 458A”_ (the “Sub-Contract Works”). The Sub-Contract Works were part of the works contracted to the Defendant by the main contractor of the project, Kay Lim Construction & Trading Pte Ltd.

2       The LOA provided that the Plaintiff would carry out the Sub-Contract Works in accordance “_with the agreed rates reflected in the confirmation as specified in the Main Contractor’s Letter of Award and comply with the terms and conditions of subcontract_.” The LOA further provided that “_Progress payments shall be in accordance with the Main Contractor’s terms and conditions. Upon receiving payment base (sic.) from the Main Contractor’s amount, a 5% Goodwill will be deducted from the amount received to (the Defendant) in his favour.”_ The Main Contractor’s terms and conditions stipulated that progress payment claims were to be made monthly based on the actual value of work done on site and that the progress claims were to be submitted on the 25th day of each calendar month.

3       On 25 December 2018, the Plaintiff sent a payment claim, Payment Claim No. 16, to the Defendant by email claiming the sum of $193,040.63 (inclusive of 7% GST) for work done up to and including 25 December 2018. The Defendant responded by email on 26 December 2018 stating that the claim was not accepted with the reasons _inter alia_ that the works were not done to the percentage as claimed. The Defendant’s email further stated that it wished to terminate the contract with immediate effect and would work out the actual balance amount to be paid to, or claimed from, the Plaintiff.

4       When no payment was received, the Plaintiff proceeded with an Adjudication Application under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B) (“SOPA”) on 28 January 2019. While the Adjudication Application was still being determined, the Defendant commenced action in the High Court in HC/S 218/2019 claiming _inter alia_ for losses due to the contractual breaches committed by the Plaintiff in particular the cost incurred in having to engage another contractor to complete the Plaintiff’s scope of works.

5       The Adjudicator issued his Adjudication Determination dated 5 March 2019 wherein he identified two issues that he had to deal with, namely:

(1)     whether the Defendant had provided a valid payment response under SOPA by way of its email dated 26 December 2018, and

(2)     the amount of progress payment properly due to the Plaintiff (if any).

6       With regard to the first issue, the Adjudicator made the finding that the email sent by the Defendant on 26 December 2018 was not a valid payment response as required by the relevant provisions in SOPA and related regulations. The Defendant’s complaints with regard to the Sub-Contract Works carried out by the Plaintiff’s workers and its counterclaim were therefore not taken into consideration by the Adjudicator. On the second issue, the Adjudicator found that the Plaintiff had established a _prima facie_ case for Payment Claim No. 16 and went on to determine that:

(a)     the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff the sum of $180,582.55 being the adjudicated amount of the determination;

(b)     the date on which the adjudicated amount became due was 14 February 2019, and the Defendant shall pay interest on the adjudicated amount at the rate of 5.33% per annum from 15 February 2019 up to the date of full payment;

(c)     the Defendant shall pay the adjudicated amount and interest to the Plaintiff within 7 days after the Adjudication Determination is served on the Defendant; and

(d)     the costs of the Adjudication being the Adjudication Application Fee of S$642.00 (inclusive of 7% GST) and the Adjudicator Fee of $19,153.00 and disbursements of S$85.60 (both figures inclusive of 7% GST) shall be borne by the Defendant in full.

7       As the Adjudication Determination was served on the Defendant on 6 March 2019, the Defendant was obliged to make payment of the adjudicated amount with interest by 13 March 2019. Payment was not made as required which led to the Plaintiff filing an _ex parte_ originating summons on 15 March 2019 for leave to enforce the Adjudication Determination in the same manner as a judgment or an order of the court to the same effect pursuant to s 27 of SOPA.

8       On 18 March 2019, the Court granted leave for enforcement of the Adjudication Determination as prayed for in the originating summons and entered judgment in the Plaintiff’s favour together with costs of the application fixed at $1,200. The Order of Court was extracted on 19 March 2019.

9       On 11 April 2019, the Defendant filed a summons (DC/SUM 1400/2019) seeking the following orders:

(1)     the enforcement of the Order of Court be stayed permanently;

(2)     alternatively to (1), that the enforcement of the Order of Court be stayed pending the disposal of the High Court action in HC/S 218/2019;

(3)     alternatively to (1) and (2), that the Plaintiff be restrained from bringing winding up proceedings against the Defendant pending the disposal of the High Court action in HC/S 218/2019 or further order.

10     Although the summons was filed as an _ex parte_ application, counsel for the Plaintiff had been notified to attend the hearing which was fixed before me on an urgent basis. After hearing the arguments from both parties, I dismissed the Defendant’s application with costs fixed at S$1,000. The Defendant being dissatisfied with my order has appealed to the High Court. My reasons for ruling against the Defendant are set out herein.

## Grounds for Defendant’s application for stay of enforcement / injunction in SUM 1400/2019

11     The Defendant’s grounds for seeking a stay of the Order of Court and the enforcement of the Adjudication Determination can be summarised as follows:

(1)     the Plaintiff appears to be insolvent and the Defendant is unlikely to recover any sums paid to the Plaintiff;

(2)     the Defendant has genuine cross-claims against the Plaintiff which are the subject matter of its suit in HC/S 218/2019; and

(3)     the irreparable harm that would be caused to the Defendant by a winding-up action.

12     In support of its application, the Defendant had filed an affidavit by its director, Eng Kim Hong, in which she had exhibited payment claims made by four of the Plaintiff’s subcontractors that had allegedly not been paid, the pleadings filed in HC/S 218/2019, as well as the statutory demand under s 254 of the Companies Act which would serve as the precursor to a winding-up action.

## Principles governing a stay of enforcement of an adjudication determination

13     In determining whether a stay ought to be granted, consideration had to be given to the legislative intent behind the SOPA regime which is to facilitate cash flow for parties in the building and construction industry. To ensure that cash flow is maintained, the adjudication determination is cloaked with temporary finality. As articulated by Sundaresh Menon CJ in delivering judgment of the Court of Appeal in _W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 380</span> at \[18\], SOPA –

_“achieves its stated purpose of facilitating cash flow in the building and construction industry in two principal ways. First, it establishes that parties who have done work or supplied goods are entitled to payment as of right: see s 5 of the Act. Second, it creates an intervening, provisional process of adjudication which, although provisional in nature, is final and binding on the parties to the adjudication until their differences are ultimately and conclusively determined or resolved: see s 21 of the Act. This is what is referred to as temporary finality.”_

14     A stay of enforcement of an adjudication determination would not readily be granted as it would run counter to the stated objective of SOPA. As explained by the Court of Appeal in _W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd_ (_supra_) at \[59\]:

_“the purpose of the Act is to ensure (inter alia) that even though adjudication determinations are interim in nature, successful claimants are paid. To this end, under s 22(1), the respondent must pay the adjudicated amount either within seven days after being served with the adjudication determination (see s 22(1)(a)), or by the deadline stipulated by the adjudicator (see s 22(1)(b)). The claimant can suspend work (see s 26(1)(d)) or take a lien on goods supplied (see s 25(2)(d)) if the respondent fails to pay. If the respondent intends to apply for a review of the adjudication determination, he must first pay the adjudicated amount to the claimant: see s 18(3). If the respondent wants to set aside the adjudication determination, he must pay into court as security the unpaid portion of the adjudicated amount: see s 27(5). This requirement is repeated in O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)._ **_These provisions all point to one thing: where a claimant succeeds in his adjudication application, he is entitled to receive the adjudicated amount quickly and cannot be denied payment without very good reason.”_**

(emphasis added in bold) 

15     At \[70\] of the Court of Appeal judgment, it was further elucidated that to justify a stay of enforcement of an adjudication determination, there has to be “_clear and objective evidence of the successful claimant’s_ **_actual present insolvency_**_, or where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that if the stay were not granted, the money paid to the claimant would not ultimately be recovered if the dispute between the parties were finally resolved in the respondent’s favour by a court or tribunal or some other dispute resolution body._”. The Court of Appeal stressed at \[71\] that a stay would not be readily granted given that the purpose of SOPA was “_precisely to avoid and guard against pushing building and construction companies over the financial precipice_”.

## No clear and objective evidence of Plaintiff’s actual present insolvency

16     The supporting affidavit of the Defendant’s director which sought to portray the Plaintiff’s apparent insolvency was stated in the following terms:

_“11_.     _.. the plaintiff appears insolvent and therefore unable to pay back the amount claimed under the adjudication determination should the defendant succeed in HC/S 218/2019._

_12_.     _I say this because 4 sub-contractors have informed me that they have submitted payment claims to the plaintiff which have not been paid.”_

17     The affidavit went on to identify the four subcontractors and exhibited their payment claims. On my examination of the documents exhibited, it appeared that the total amount claimed by the subcontractors added up to less than $32,043.52[^1]. Other than the fact that this was a significantly small sum in comparison with the adjudicated amount of $180,582.55, the assertion by the Defendant’s director that she had been informed by the four subcontractors that they had submitted claims to the Plaintiff which had not been paid, without more, could hardly qualify as clear and objective evidence of the Plaintiff’s actual present insolvency.

## The Defendant’s claim in HC/ S 218/2019

18     From the submissions made by Mr Rai, counsel for the Defendant, it appeared that the Defendant was aggrieved that the Plaintiff had succeeded in the adjudication proceedings on a mere technicality. The Defendant’s counterclaims (which are now the subject of the High Court suit, S 218/2019) had thus been disregarded by the Adjudicator. According to the Defendant’s director, it had chosen not to seek a review of the adjudication or to set aside the Adjudication Determination pursuant to the provisions of SOPA as it had been advised of the “difficulty” of this approach.

19     I agreed with the submission made by counsel for the Plaintiff that the SOPA regime which is based on the concept of temporary finality necessitated that payment had to be made pending the resolution of disputes and issues in the underlying construction contract between the parties. Under the SOPA regime, a respondent who wishes to apply for a review of the adjudication determination had to first pay the adjudicated amount to the claimant. A respondent who wishes to set aside the adjudication determination had to make payment into court of the unpaid adjudicated amount as security. By filing the High Court suit and making the application for stay of enforcement purely on the strength of its pleaded case in the High Court suit without intimating how payment of the Adjudicated Amount would be made, the Defendant appeared to be circumventing the SOPA process which required payment to be made first before any challenge could be made to the adjudication outcome.

## Injunction to restrain the Plaintiff from commencing winding up proceedings

20     From the submissions made by counsel for the Defendant, the main concern of the Defendant was to pre-empt the irreparable prejudice that might be caused in the event of a winding-up action. On the preliminary issue as to whether the District Court had the power to make such an order, I agreed with counsel for the Defendant that based on a reading of s 31(2)(a) of the State Courts Act (Cap 321), the District Court was not precluded from granting such an injunction since the injunction being sought was in relation to the enforcement of the judgment obtained in DC/OSS 42/2019 which is an action within the District Court’s jurisdiction.

21     While the Plaintiff had issued the statutory demand that could potentially lead to a winding-up, I found no basis to issue an injunction to restrain the Plaintiff from taking this course of action. The Defendant simply had to make payment in accordance with the Adjudication Determination to forestall any winding-up action. If the Defendant failed to make payment, that could be an indication that it is unable to pay its debts in which case the Plaintiff should be entitled to commence a winding-up action.

## The _Erinford_ Order

22     After I dismissed the Defendant’s application, counsel informed me that he had instructions to appeal to the High Court and sought an _Erinford_ order on the basis that the appeal would be rendered nugatory should the Defendant succeed in the appeal. Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that a similar application had been made before the High Court in _AES Façade Pte Ltd v WYSE Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 640</span> which was dismissed. The High Court held that a stay of execution of the court’s orders pending an intended appeal was not justified as it could not have been intended that the considerations behind SOPA could be circumvented easily by the filing of an appeal.

23     I declined to make any _Erinford_ order as there was no material before me to suggest that the Defendant’s appeal would be rendered nugatory. The Defendant had not furnished any compelling evidence to persuade me that should they succeed in the appeal, any monies paid by them in compliance with the Judgment would not be recoverable. As far as winding-up action was concerned, as mentioned in \[21\] above, this could be easily prevented by making payment of the Adjudicated Amount as required.

## Conclusion

24     The Defendant’s application in DC/SUM 1400/2019 was accordingly dismissed with costs fixed at S$1,000. The Defendant’s oral application for an _Erinford_ order was also dismissed.
