### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Muhammad Yahya Budiman, a 25 years-old male Singapore citizen had pleaded guilty to the following 6 changes namely:

> (a)     Traffic Police –

>> (i)       Notice No 201009993311-1 – a charge under s 65(1)(a) punishable under s 65(5)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, Rev Ed 2004)(“RTA”);

>> (ii)       Notice No 206168737411-1 – a charge under s 63(1) of the RTA;

> (b)     Land Transport Authority –

>> (i)       LTA-2021-000245-1 – a charge under s 3(1) punishable under s 3(2) and s 3(3) Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, Rev Ed 2000)(“MVA”);

>> (ii)       LTA-2021-000245-2 and Notice No. 4200178334 – 2 charges under s 15 punishable under s 15(a) of the RTA;

>> (iii)       LTA Notice No. 4210122755-1 – a charge under s 10(1) punishable under s 10(3) of the RTA.

2       A remaining charge under s 27(2) punishable under s 27(3) of the RTA in LTA Notice No 4210122755-2 was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After considering the accused’s plea in mitigation, I imposed the following sentences:

> (a)     Notice No 201009993311-1 - $500 in default 1 day's imprisonment;

> (b)     Notice No 206168737411-1 - $500 in default 1 day's imprisonment;

> (c)     LTA-2021-000245-1 - $600 in default 1 day's imprisonment and a disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of twelve months with effect from 4 July 2022;

> (d)     LTA-2021-000245-2 and Notice No. 4200178334 - $500 in default 1 day's imprisonment per charge.

4       His total sentence for the 6 proceeded charges was a fine of $3,100 in default 6 days' imprisonment and a disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of twelve months with effect from 4 July 2022. In addition, as the accused had three counts of show cause for his failure to attend court and cause was not shown, he was given a fine of $300 in default 3 days’ imprisonment. As he is presently in DRC, I ordered the default sentences of 9 days to take effect from 4 July 2022 if the fines were not paid in full.

5       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against the disqualification order in LTA-2021-000245-1 on 6 July 2022. He began serving his default sentence on 4 July 2022 as the fines were not paid. The charge in LTA-2021-000245-1 is set out below:

Charge

> are charged that you, on 21st October 2020 at about 6.40 pm along Blk 547 Segar Road Multi Storey Carpark Deck 3A, Singapore, did use a motorcycle no. FBB2327K, where there was not in force in relation to the user of the said motor vehicle such a policy of insurance in respect of Third-Party Risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed), in contravention of Section 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act, Chapter 189 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 3(2) – (3) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act, Chapter 189.

6       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

7       The complainant is one Mohd Hasni, a Station Inspector attached to Bukit Panjang Neighbourhood Police Centre, Singapore Police Force.

8       The complainant reported that on 21 October 2020 at about 6.40pm at Block 547 Segar Road Multistorey Carpark Deck 3A, he spotted and stopped the accused who was riding the motorcycle bearing registration FBB2327K for checks. Upon checking, it was discovered that the accused was riding the motorcycle without valid insurance coverage and vehicle licence (road tax) in force.

9       The accused is the registered owner of the motorcycle. The vehicle licence (road tax) for the motorcycle had expired on 16 September 2020. There was no vehicle licence (road tax) in force when it was being used on 21 October 2020.

10     The accused’s last insurance policy with Etiqa Insurance Pte Ltd was valid for the period from 18 September 2019 to 17 September 2020. Hence, there was no such policy of insurance or such security in respect of third-party risks as complied with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act, Chapter 189 when the motorcycle was used on 21 October 2020.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

11     The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risk and Compensation) Act (“MVA”) is fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. S 3(3) of the MVA provides that a person convicted of an offence under this section shall be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the RTA for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

## Antecedents

12     The accused did not have any similar antecedents.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

13     The Prosecution sought a fine of $600 fine and a disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of twelve months.

## Mitigation

14     In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused had pleaded for leniency.

## My decision on sentence

15     The sentence for an offence under s 3(1) of the MVA for a first offender is usually a fine ranging from $600 to $800 and the mandatory disqualification for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

16     The meaning of “special reasons” was considered by the High Court in the cases of _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span> and _Prathib s/o M Balan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1066</span>. The High Court held that the phrase “special reasons” has a narrow meaning. Only reasons connected to the offence and not reasons related to the offender are to be considered. In the present case, no special reasons connected to the offence were provided by the accused in his mitigation. Instead, the accused had only pleaded for leniency.

17     In _Sulaiman bin Mohd Hassan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 132</span>, Tay Yong Kwang JA affirmed the fine of $700 and disqualification order of 12 months from the date of conviction imposed by the trial judge on appeal. In the present case, as the accused had pleaded guilty to the charge in LTA-2021-000245-1, he had no similar antecedents and there were no culpability enhancing factors present, I was of the view that a fine of $600 and the mandatory disqualification order of 12 months with effect from the date of conviction was just and appropriate in the circumstances. Such a period of disqualification was appropriate to fulfil the objectives of punishment, the protection of the public and deterrence.

## Conclusion

18     The offences committed on 21 October 2020 in LTA-2021-000245 were detected when the complainant conducted a spot check on the accused at the multi-storey carpark at Block 547 Segar Road. The present case serves to illustrate the difficulty in detecting such offences under the RTA and the MVA and the need to impose deterrent sentences as part of the Court’s sentencing consideration.
