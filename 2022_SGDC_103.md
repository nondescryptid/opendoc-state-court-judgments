### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       On 19 May 2020, the accused, Geevanathan s/o Thirunavakarusu (“the accused”), was charged in court for one charge of committing mischief by fire, an offence under s 435 of the Penal Code, Cap 224 (“PC”). He was remanded at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for psychiatric observation under s 247(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68 (“CPC”).

2       On 20 June 2020, an addition charge for consuming _methamphetamine_, without authorization, an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185 (“MDA”) was preferred against him. As the accused had previously been convicted for an offence for the consumption of _Monoacetylmorphine_ and punished under s.33A(1) of the MDA, he was now liable to be punished under s.33A(2) of the MDA ie. an LT2 offence.

3       On 25 March 2022, the accused pleaded guilty to the LT2 charge. The charge under s 435 of the PC was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC”).

## Summary of the facts

4       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. The following is a summary of the facts. It is fairly straightforward.

5       On 18 May 2020 at about 0410 hours, the accused was arrested in connection with a large fire that occurred the previous day in a flat in Jurong. Upon his arrest, he was brought back to Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters (“Woodlands PDHQ”).

6       At Woodlands PDHQ, the accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed and marked in his presence. These samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for testing. Both the accused’s urine samples tested positive for _methamphetamine_, a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

7       The accused admitted to smoking “ice” (a street name for _methamphetamine_) sometime in the early morning of 17 May 2020. He had been smoking “ice” for about 10 months prior to his arrest and would do so daily. His daily consumption of “ice” amounted to approximately 0.5 to 1 grams of the drug.

8       Prior to the commission of this offence, the accused had been convicted on 12 August 2013 on one count under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(1) of the MDA, (_vide_ DAC 24486/2012) ie. an LT1 offence, for consuming a Specified Drug, to wit, _monoacetylmorphin_e, for which he was sentenced to 5 years’ 4 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of cane. As this conviction has not been set aside, the accused is thus now liable to be punished under s 33A(2) of the MDA.

## Antecedents

9       The accused has numerous court convictions. These are set out below:

11     The accused admitted to his antecedents without qualification.

## Prosecution’s & Defence’s sentencing submissions

### Prosecution’s sentencing submission

12     The Prosecution sought for the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

### Defence’s sentencing submission / plea in mitigation

13     The Defence, in its plea in mitigation, urged the Court to call for a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”) suitability report under s 339(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”). The following factors were put forward to support this submission.

#### The court was not precluded from imposing an MTO

14     Although s 337(1) of the CPC sets out the types of offences and offenders for which the court would be unable to impose a community-based-sentence (“CBS”), which includes an MTO, it was nonetheless submitted that the court was not precluded from imposing an MTO on an offender who had been convicted for an LT2 offence by virtue of the MTO carve out at s 337(2) of the CPC. In particular, ss 337(2)(a) and 337(2)(b) provides that a court can impose an MTO even if an accused is:

> (a)     a person mentioned under s 337(1)(d) or (g) of the CPC;[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> (b)     convicted of an offence under the MDA 1973, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations or the Intoxicating Substances Act 1987, after having previously been admitted to an approved institution or an approved centre.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

#### The court should call for an MTO suitability report

15     Having submitted that the accused was eligible for an MTO, the Defence next submitted that the court should call for an MTO suitability report. The Defence cited the High Court decision in _GCX v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1325</span> (“_GCX_”) which set out the factors that a court would have to consider when it determines whether or not an MTO suitability report should be called for, and when an MTO should eventually be ordered.

16     The High Court in _GCX_ held that, at this stage, the court would only need to be satisfied that there was a real prospect of rehabilitation.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) In this regard, it was highlighted that the accused has made tremendous progress since his arrest in May 2020. He had remained drug free since and had been dutifully attending sessions at the National Addiction Management Service (“NAMS”). For the first time in a long time, the accused had also managed to obtain gainful employment. The court should therefore call for an MTO suitability report to be fully appraised of the accused’s true rehabilitative potential.

17     The Defence also referred to a psychiatric report dated 27 May 2020 prepared by Dr Lucas Lim[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) (“Dr Lim”) from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”). The accused, when he was first charged in court for the offence of mischief by fire, had been ordered by the court to be remanded at IMH to undergo psychiatric observation pursuant to s 247(3) of the CPC.

18     The Defence submitted that the IMH report had found a causal link between the accused’s mental illness and the offences.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) In particular, at \[16(a)\] of the IMH report, Dr Lim had opined that the accused’s “ _…. mental illness had contributed to the alleged offence, as he demonstrated clear disorganization of his behaviour and marked paranoid delusions around the time of the alleged offence_.” This, submitted the Defence, was relevant as s 339(3)(c) of the CPC requires that a psychiatrist, “_in the preparation of an MTO report, to be satisfied that the psychiatric condition of the offender \[was\] one of the contributing factors for his committing the offence.”[^6]_

### Prosecution’s reply

19     The Prosecution agreed with the Defence that the option of calling for an MTO suitability report was open to the court. However, the Prosecution objected to the calling of the report. The following reasons were highlighted:

> (a)     The accused’s rehabilitative prospects were questionable. First, the accused had been convicted of an LT2 offence. An offender is only punishable under LT2 when he has numerous related or identical antecedents. The accused had also now started consuming _methamphetamine_, which is a different drug from his LT1 conviction, which was _monoacetylmorphine_. In addition, the accused had admitted that he was consuming _methamphetamine_ daily about ten months prior to his arrest;[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

> (b)     There is no evidence at present to suggest that the accused was suffering from any mental condition that contributed to his drug consumption offence.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) Although the IMH report does refer to a contributory link between the accused’s _drug induced psychosis_ and _the offence_, _the offence_ being referred to in the IMH report is the offence of mischief by fire, namely the TIC charge, and not the LT2 drug consumption charge.

20     Further, the Prosecution objected to the imposition of an MTO on the accused. It was submitted that in the present case, it was not expedient having regard to the circumstances to be the nature of the offence as well as the character of the offender, that an MTO should be ordered.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

## Decision on sentence

21     The issues before me were as follows:

> (a)     Whether the accused is eligible for an MTO;

> (b)     Whether an MTO suitability report should be called for; and

> (c)     If not, what was the appropriate sentence to be imposed.

### Whether the accused is eligible for an MTO

22     The Defence had submitted that the court is not precluded from calling a MTO suitability report. The Prosecution agreed with the Defence’s submission.

23     Under s 337(1) of the CPC, the court would be unable to impose a CBS (which includes an MTO), for certain offenders and offences. As the accused had been convicted for an LT2 charge, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and mandatory minimum caning of six strokes, the court would, on the face of it, be excluded from imposing an MTO because:

> (a)     The LT2 offence has a mandatory minimum imprisonment term and caning and is an offence that is punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds 3 years;[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

> (b)     The accused has previously been sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding three months;[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

> (c)     The LT2 offence is one under the MDA and the accused had previously been admitted to an approved institution;[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

24     However, the MTO carve out is provided for in s 337(2) of the CPC. This provides that ;

> (2)    A court may not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of any case referred to in subsection (1) except that it may do so under section 339 even if the offender —

>> (a)    is a person mentioned in subsection (1)(d) or (g);

>> (b)    is convicted of an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations or the Intoxicating Substances Act 1987, **_after having previously been admitted to an approved institution or an approved centre_**; or

>> (c)    is convicted of an offence that is punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 3 years but not exceeding 7 years, and is prescribed.

25     The specific MTO carve out for MDA offences at s 337(2)(b) of the CPC suggested that an MTO is a viable option when what appears to be the condition precedent is met, that is to say, for an offender who has been “_convicted for an MDA offence_, **_after having previously_** _been admitted to an approved institution or an approved centre_.” The accused has been convicted for an MDA charge _and_ had previously been admitted to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”), an approved institution. [\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

26     Accordingly, it would appear that a plain reading of s 337(2)(b) of the CPC suggested that the court was not excluded from considering MTO as a sentencing option, even the accused was convicted of was an LT2 offence.

27     However, I disagreed with the position taken by the Defence and Prosecution that the accused was eligible for an MTO. Having reviewed the rationale for CBS and the MTO provisions, I was of the view that the Defence’s interpretation of s 337(2)(b) was unsatisfactory. Instead, I was of the opinion that the accused was not eligible for an MTO.

28     First, is the rationale for CBS. This was explained in the introductory speech of the Minister of Law, Mr K Shanmugam, at the second reading of the Criminal Procedure Code Bill (Bill 11 of 2010) (“CPC Bill 2010”) (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 422 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs)):

> CBS gives more flexibility to the Courts. Not every offender should be put in prison. CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the Court to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum: regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions. For such cases, it is appropriate to harness the resources of the community. The offender remains gainfully employed and his family benefit from the focused treatment.

29     An LT2 offence does not appear to fit the category offences that had been envisaged by the introduction of CBS. It is an extremely serious offence that carries with it a severe punishment prescribed by law upon conviction, namely, a mandatory imprisonment term of seven years and mandatory caning of six strokes. Also, an offender facing an LT2 offence would already have several (if not many) drug consumption antecedents, including minimally, a previous conviction for an LT1 offence and one or two additional previous convictions for drug consumption and / or one or two previous admissions to a DRC. This fact alone would suggest that an LT2 offender’s rehabilitation potential was extremely poor. Therefore, if an LT2 offender were to be eligible for an MTO, this would seem extremely peculiar as this would go against the rationale of CBS.

30     The Defence’s submission[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) appeared to suggest that it did not matter when or how many times an offender is admitted to an approved institution or centre. As long as an offender has been admitted to one, he would have fulfilled the requirement in s 337(2)(b) of the CPC and would be eligible for an MTO. However, this could lead to an oddly peculiar situation where an LT2 offender facing a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years imprisonment could, in theory, be eligible for an MTO, if he had a previous admission to an approved institution, but the same would not be available to an offender convicted for a lesser drug consumption offence. For example, an offender facing an offence under s 33(4) of the MDA (“enhanced drug consumption charge”), or an LT1 offence, for which the mandatory imprisonment terms are three and five years respectively, would not then be eligible for an MTO if that offender had never previously been admitted to an approved institution or centre.

31     The provision states that an offender is eligible for an MTO notwithstanding the fact that he has been convicted for an MDA offence, _“ ……_ **_after_** _having previously been admitted to an approved institution or an approved centre”._ This is understandable. The purpose of an approved institution, namely DRC, is to wean an offender off his drug habit without the necessity of a court conviction. Hence, if an offender, having been admitted to a DRC, is thereafter convicted for a drug consumption offence, the DRC admission will not preclude him from being eligible for an MTO. Hence, I am of the view that the admission to an approved institution or centre referred to at s 337(2)(b) of the CPC should be limited in scope. It does not refer to any admission that can be found in an offender’s drug history but is limited to admissions that form the basis of the MDA charge faced by the offender. For example, where an offender faces:

> (a)     an enhanced drug consumption charge by virtue of his previous admission under s 33(4AA)(a)(ii) of the MDA; or

> (b)     an LT1 charge on the basis that he has one (or two) previous admissions under ss 33A(1)(a), 33A(1)(d) or 33A(1)(e).

32     The accused was admitted to an approved institution, ie. a DRC on 18 December 2008, prior to his earlier LT1 conviction. At the time of his LT1 conviction, he would be eligible for an MTO as he was convicted for his LT1 offence _after_ he was admitted to a DRC and this admission formed the basis of the accused’s LT1 offence. The present LT2 offence was committed _after_ his LT1 offence. The LT1 offence formed the basis of his present LT2 offence. I a of the view that the accused’s present LT2 offence was therefore not committed **_after having previously_** been admitted to an approved institution. Therefore, I found that the accused, an LT2 offender, was not eligible for an MTO.

### Whether the court should call for an MTO suitability report

33     If, however, I am wrong, and instead, the accused is eligible for an MTO, then I would next have to consider whether the court should call for an MTO suitability report.

34     The legislative basis for making an MTO is found in ss 339(1) to (14) of the CPC. Specifically, ss 339(1) to (4) state as follows:

> Mandatory treatment orders

> 339.—(1)    Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4), where an offender is convicted of an offence, and if the court by or before which he is convicted is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may make a mandatory treatment order requiring the offender to undergo psychiatric treatment for a period not exceeding 36 months.

> (1A)  A mandatory treatment order may also require an offender to reside in a psychiatric institution during the whole or a specified part of the period that the offender is required to undergo psychiatric treatment.

> (2)    Before making a mandatory treatment order, the court must call for a report to be submitted by an appointed psychiatrist.

> (3)    A court may make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender only if the report submitted by an appointed psychiatrist states that —

>> (a)    the offender is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment;

>> (b)    the offender is suitable for the treatment; and

>> (c)    the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for his committing the offence.

> (4)    A court must not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender if the report submitted by the appointed psychiatrist states that he is not satisfied with any of the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a) to (c). \[emphasis added\]

35     The High Court decision of _GCX_ sets out when the court should contemplate calling for an MTO suitability report. In _GCX_, the offender was convicted for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt to his wife under s 323 of the PC. The offender had produced a medical report prepared by an IMH psychiatrist who assessed him to be suffering from an adjustment disorder and that this condition had substantially contributed to the offence. The district judge declined to call for an MTO suitability report and instead, sentenced the offender to 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

36     On appeal, See Kee Oon J held at \[37\] that the court should only contemplate calling for a MTO suitability report if there were sufficient facts showing that the offender had some rehabilitative potential, and that rehabilitation would not be completely outweighed by other sentencing considerations.

37     See J then set out how a court should identify the appropriate threshold of an offender’s rehabilitative potential in determining whether to call for a MTO suitability report. At this stage, it was a balancing inquiry into the various sentencing principles and the threshold is lower than at the post-report stage where the court would have to consider whether to order the MTO itself. At \[47\], he summarised the approach as follows:

> I now summarise the approach I have laid out above. In my view, in considering whether to call for an MTO suitability report, the court should bear in mind the following. The court should identify and balance the relevant sentencing principles, giving each its appropriate weight. Having done so, the court would have some sense of the offender’s rehabilitative potential. The threshold to be met as to the offender’s rehabilitative potential before an MTO suitability report would be called for should not be overly restrictive. The court would need to be persuaded that rehabilitation was a real prospect, and that the other sentencing principles were not so dominant that rehabilitation should be rejected out of hand. This threshold incorporated the principle identified in \[59(g)\] of Kong Peng Yee, which recognised that other sentencing principles might so substantially trump the principle of rehabilitation that it was unnecessary to inquire further into the offender’s rehabilitative potential. The determination whether the threshold was met, and correspondingly, whether the scenario contemplated in principle (g) of Kong Peng Yee applied, was intensely fact-dependent. The court should bear in mind, however, that it should not lightly find that other sentencing principles so substantially trumped the principle of rehabilitation that there was simply no need to call for the MTO suitability report. This caution was warranted because the court still lacked, at this stage, the necessary facts to apprise itself fully of the offender’s true rehabilitative potential.

38     Hence, the court at this stage would have to identify and balance the relevant sentencing principles, assess the accused’s rehabilitative potential and whether other sentencing principles outweighed the prospect of rehabilitation or there was a real prospect of rehabilitation such that other sentencing principles were not so dominant that rehabilitation should outrightly be rejected.

#### The accused’s rehabilitative potential

39     To recap, the Prosecution had urged the court not to call for an MTO suitability report. It was submitted that, as the accused had been convicted of an LT2 offence and had numerous drug related antecedents, this pointed to, amongst other things, a lack of rehabilitative potential.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

40     Where an offender has been convicted for an LT2 (or even an LT1) offence, that offender would be likely to have numerous drug related antecedents. Even if that offender were to be eligible for an MTO, his rehabilitative potential, even if it were not extinguished, would be reduced by reason of his drug antecedents. In my view, the more numerous the drug consumption antecedents an offender has, the more his rehabilitative potential is reduced and therefore, it would take more from the offender to persuade the court that:

> (a)     his rehabilitation was a real prospect; and

> (b)     this rehabilitation would trump the other sentencing principles, for example, deterrence and prevention.

41     The accused’s criminal record set out at \[9\] and \[10\] of these grounds show that his involvement with drugs began more than 20 years ago. Prior to his conviction for the LT1 offence on 12 August 2013, the accused had already previously been convicted for the possession of _diamorphine_ in 2000 and for the consumption of _methamphetamine_ in 2007. He was also sent to a DRC in 2008.

42     For the LT1 offence, the accused was sentenced to five years and four months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for an LT1 charge, together with charges for failing to attend his urine tests. His drug of choice then was _monoacetylmorphine_ and _morphine_.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) Since his LT1 conviction, the accused did not simply continue to consume drugs but had expanded his drug horizon. The LT2 offence was for the consumption of _methamphetamine_. In fact, in the SOF, the accused admitted that he had been smoking “ice” for about 10 months prior to his arrest, and would do so daily and that his daily consumption of “ice” amounted to approximately 0.5 to 1 grams of the drug.

43     It should also be noted that the accused did not remain drug free for long. The records show that the accused was released from prison for the LT1 offence on or about 3 February 2017. [\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) He was subsequently convicted of a cheating offence and sentenced to 18 weeks’ imprisonment on 4 April 2017.[^18] This meant that, at best, the accused was only drug free for about two years, from the time he was released from prison after serving his sentence for cheating offence, (approximately in July 2017) until before he started consuming ice in July 2019 (10 months prior to his arrest in May 2020).

44     Although the accused has been regular for his appointments at NAMS, I noted that these appointments only commenced after the accused was charged with the present drug consumption offence. There is nothing to show that the accused sought help for his drug addiction after he was released from prison. It would appear that the accused saw no need to “rehabilitate” himself until he was caught for consuming drugs. Further, there is also nothing before the court to show the how the accused had progressed since then and the fact that the accused has kept his appointments at NAMS does not automatically indicate that his rehabilitation was a real prospect.

45     The accused’s more than 20-year association with drugs did not speak well of his rehabilitative potential. I was not persuaded that the accused had a real prospect of rehabilitation, let alone the fact that rehabilitation would trump deterrence and prevention, which I adjudged to be the dominant principles in drug consumption offences, and more so in repeat drug consumption cases, and in particular, in the present case, for an LT2 offence.

#### Whether the offender’s psychiatric condition was a contributing factor in the commission of the offence

##### (1)   The “psychiatric” condition

46     There are two IMH reports. The first is dated 29 May 2020 (“the 1st IMH report”), made pursuant to the accused’s remand under s 247(3) of the CPC, which had been alluded to earlier in these grounds. The second is dated 16 September 2021 (“the 2nd IMH report”) and was prepared in response to Counsel’s request.

47     The 1st IMH report states, at \[16(a)\], that the accused was suffering from a _drug induced psychosis_, although this was in relation to the offence of causing mischief by fire and not for the consumption of drugs. The Defence had submitted that this was a mental illness, and the court should therefore call for an MTO suitability report as one of the conditions for the imposition of an MTO under s 339 of the CPC had been fulfilled.

48     In my view, _psychosis_ is NOT a form of mental illness as suggested by the Defence. It is a symptom and is a term used to describe a condition of being disoriented with reality. There are many causes of psychosis including a mental condition or a medical condition. In this case, the accused’s mental condition or state of mind was caused directly as a result of his own drug consumption or abuse and not as a result of a psychological or physical medical condition.

##### (2)   The contributory link

49     Even if the accused’s _drug induced psychosis_ is considered a mental illness, the next issue is whether there was a link, contributory or otherwise, between that mental illness and the offence that the accused has been convicted of.

50     The Defence had submitted that, at \[81\] in _GCX_, the High Court found that it was not necessary for a causal link to be shown between an offender’s mental illness and his commission of the offence before an MTO could be ordered. [\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) In the present case, “_it is undisputed that there is_ _contributory link_ _between Geeva’s mental illness and the offence \[and\] there is also of Geeva’s long-standing struggle with mental illness_”.[^20] Therefore, the fact that there was a finding of a causal link in the 1st IMH report bolstered the case for an MTO suitability report to be called.

51     First, I am of the opinion that See J’s findings in _GCX_ that it was not necessary for a causal link to be shown should be read in its proper context. This is because s 339(3) of the CPC makes no reference to a causal link but instead refers to a contributary link between an offender’s mental illness and the commission of the offence.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

52     Next, having reviewed these two IMH reports, I disagreed with the Defence’s submission that these two reports, individually or collectively, showed that there was any link between the accused’s mental illness (if there was indeed one) and the offence committed. The reports did not bolster the Defence’s case in any way.

53     The two IMH reports relied on by the Defence do not state that that the accused was suffering from any mental illness _during the commission of the LT2 offence_. Any mental illness, if at all, that was suffered by the accused is in relation to the mischief by fire offence. The 2nd IMH report is also not helpful. It simply states that the accused had been admitted to IMH six times between 2011-2012 for the management of the accused’s opioid and alcohol addiction. In fact, the 2nd IMH indicated to me that the accused is a long-term hardcore drug addict, having been a drug abuser since 2000, in addition to being an alcoholic.

54     The Defence seemed to suggest that simply because there is an assertion that the accused is suffering from some form of mental illness, in this case, a _drug induced psychosis_, the court should call for an MTO suitability report. [\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) This cannot be so. A mere assertion of a mental illness cannot be the basis of calling for an MTO suitability report. At this stage, the onus is on the accused to show that he is suffering from a mental illness that that the mental illness that he is said to be suffering from, is linked to the offence that he has been convicted of. The accused has not shown any such link.

55     The following cases highlight that one of the factors that determines whether a court would (or would not) call for an MTO suitability report is the presence of a link between the mental illness suffered by an offender and the offence committed as a consequence of that mental illness:

> (a)      _GCX_. The accused was convicted of an offence under s 323 of the PC for causing hurt to his wife. At first instance, the district judge declined to call for an MTO suitability report even though the offender’s IMH report highlighted that he was suffering from an adjustment disorder which had substantially contributed to the offence. The appeal by the offender was allowed by the High Court and See J called for the MTO suitability report;

> (b)      _Public Prosecutor v Vu Han Jean-Luc Ha_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGMC 21</span> (“_Jean Luc_”). The offender was convicted of an offence under s 3(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cp 256A) (“POHA”) and another under s 323 of the PC. The victim was 13-years old. The district judge called for an MTO suitability report despite the objections of the Prosecution. The offender had been diagnosed by IMH to be suffering from bipolar disorder which contributed to the commission of the offence.[^23] This case is presently pending the outcome of an appeal by the Prosecution.

> (c)      _Public Prosecutor v Sean Lee Yang_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 84</span> (”_Sean Lee_”). The offender was convicted of two offences under the PC, one under s 204 and another under s 377BB(6). He had secretly filmed male toilet users urinating and subsequently disposed of the memory card containing the offending pictures when his act was discovered. The district judge declined to call for an MTO suitability report as he found that the IMH report did not draw a link between the offender’s diagnosed behaviour of dysthymia and his offending behaviour.[^24] The appeal has since lapsed.

> (d)      _Public Prosecutor v Abdul Fathani bin Khairuddin_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 143</span> (“_Fathani_”). The offender was convicted of three offences under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”), including one for driving under disqualification under s 43(4) of the RTA. The offender’s private psychiatrist report stated that there was a “_causal link between the accused’s state of depression and anxiety with his poor judgment or decision-making process …._”.[^25] The district judge proceeded to analyse the psychiatric report and the facts of the case and concluded that there was no contributory link between the accused mental illness and offence and declined to call an MTO suitability report. This case is presently pending the outcome of an appeal by the Defence.

56     In contrast, the two IMH reports in the present case did not show that the accused was suffering from any mental illness _when he committed the LT2 offence_, let alone the fact that there was any contributory link to the LT2 offence.

57     Further, any link that could possibly be drawn between the accused’s _drug induced psychosis_ and the LT2 drug consumption is extremely tenuous at best. Dr Lim’s opinion at \[16(a)\] of the 1st IMH report states that the accused’s mental illness **_was caused_** _by the taking of drugs_ and not the other way around. In other words, the accused was suffering from a mental condition precisely _because_ he deliberately consumed drugs. His consumption of drugs was not the result of an existing mental condition. His _drug induced psychosis_, therefore, did not cause him to commit the LT2 offence. It would seem perverse, or at least concerning, if an offender in such a situation could avail himself to an MTO or even rely on this as a mitigating factor. Dr Lim’s opinion in the 1st IMH report is set out below for easy reference:

> The accused has **Drug Induced Psychosis**, which can be conceptualized as a psychotic disease caused by recreational drugs, characterized by hallucinations, delusions and disorganized behaviour, He was also likely intoxicated with **Methamphetamine** at the time of the alleged offence, as he had consumed it in the morning prior to the purported act. He has a background of **Stimulant Use Disorder** (Methamphetamine) which is conceptualized as a problematic pattern of stimulant use, in spite of knowing the deleterious consequence of such a habit. His mental illness has contributed to the alleged offence, as he demonstrated clear disorganization of his behaviour and marked paranoid delusions at the time of the alleged offence. (emphasis added)

#### Conclusion

58     All considered, having heard the submissions of the Defence, I adjudged that:

> (a)     the accused had no real prospect of rehabilitation;

> (b)     the accused’s _drug induced psychosis_ was not a mental illness, and it was caused by his own drug consumption or abuse;

> (c)     there was no link the between the _drug induced psychosis_ that the accused was suffering from and the commission of the LT2 offence that he had been convicted of.

59     I therefore declined to call for an MTO suitability report

### The appropriate sentence

60     Having decided against the calling of an MTO suitability report, I next considered what would be the appropriate sentence for the LT2 offence.

61     Under s 33A(2) of the MDA, the punishment prescribed by law for an LT2 offence is:

> (a)     a term of imprisonment of not less than seven years and not more than 13 years; and

> (b)     caning of not less than six strokes and not more than 12 strokes.

62     The Prosecution did not seek for anything higher than the mandatory minimum sentence. They sought no uplift for the TIC charge. Other than the submissions regarding the calling for an MTO suitability report, the Defence did not make any further submission on sentence.

63     As there were no offender-specific or offence-specific aggravating factors, I was in agreement with the Prosecution that the mandatory minimum sentence would be appropriate.

## Final sentence imposed

64     In summary, I adjudged the following:

> (a)     that as an LT2 offender, the accused could not avail himself to the MDA carve out under s 337(2)(b) of the CPC and was not eligible for an MTO;

> (b)     that, however, even if I was wrong, and the accused was eligible for an MTO, I declined to call for an MTO suitability report because:

>> (i)       the accused had no real prospect of rehabilitation;

>> (ii)       the accused’s _drug induced psychosis_ was not a mental illness, and it was caused by his own consumption of drugs; and

>> (iii)       there was no link, contributory or otherwise, between the _drug induced psychosis_ that the accused was suffering from and the commission of the LT2 offence that he had been convicted of;

> (c)     that the appropriate sentence in the present case was the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by law for an LT2 offence.

65     I accordingly sentenced the accused the **mandatory minimum sentence of seven years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane**.

66     The accused, being dissatisfied with my refusal to call for an MTO suitability report has now appealed against my decision. The accused is presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.
