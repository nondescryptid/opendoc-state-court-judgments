10 December 2019

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The accused, Tan Ah Kiat, is a 40-year-old male Singaporean citizen. He pleaded guilty to the following three charges (hereafter “proceeded charges”):

> (a)     1st charge (DAC-914178-2019): Theft in dwelling house punishable under section 380 of the Penal Code (PC) \[hereafter “theft-in-dwelling charge”\];

> (b)     2nd charge (DAC-923086-2019): Failing to return to the supervision centre after cancellation of the notice of leave, which is an offence under Regulation 12(1) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institution and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Regulations”) read with Regulation 12(4) of the said Regulations, and punishable under Regulation 12(5) of the said Regulations. \[hereafter “MDR charge”\]; and

> (c)     3rd charge (DAC-923087-2019): Consumption of methamphetamine under section 8(b)(ii) with enhanced punishment under s 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) \[hereafter “LT1 charge”\].

2       Three other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“the TIC charges”). These consisted of the following:

> (a)     1 charge of being in possession of drug utensils under s 9 punishable under s 33A of the MDA;

> (b)     1 charge of committing theft-in-dwelling under section 380 of the PC; and

> (c)     1 charge of committing theft under section 379 of the PC.

3       After reviewing the Statement of Facts (SOF), the prosecution’s sentencing submissions and the mitigation plea, I sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 5 years and 12 months’ imprisonment with effect from 07-September-2019, and three (3) strokes of the cane.

4       The accused being dissatisfied has filed an appeal against sentence. I now give the reasons for my decision on sentence.

## (2)   The proceeded charges and the SOF

5       The proceeded charges are reproduced below.

> (a)     1st charge (theft-in-dwelling charge) reads:

>> “You….are charged that you, on the 8th day of May 2019, at or about 8.25 p.m., at the Athena Jewels & Watches Pte Ltd located at Blk 131 Jurong Gateway Road #01-261, Singapore, a building used for the custody of property, did commit theft of one Rolex Half R/G Yacht Master II Model 116681 (Serial Number S445M629) valued at SGD$24,480/- in the possession of Teo Zhi Xing, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 380 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

> (b)     2nd charge (MDR charge):

>> “ You…are charged that you, between 23rd April 2019 to 8th May 2019, in Singapore, being an inmate of an Approved Institution namely, Lloyd Leas Community Centre, did fail to return to the Approved Institution after the leave granted to you to participate in the Halfway House Programme conducted by Teen Challenge (Singapore) Halfway House, from 13th March 2019 to 8th September 2019 under Regulation 12(1) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institution and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Regulations”) was cancelled on 24th April 2019 under Regulation 12(4) of the said Regulations, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Regulation 12(5) of the said Regulations.”

6       The accused admitted to the SOF without qualification. The SOF is largely reproduced below:

The accused is Tan Ah Kiat, a 40-year-old Male Singaporean citizen (Date of Birth: 26 July 1979), Singapore Citizen bearing NRIC No: S79XXXXXXX. At the material time, the accused was unemployed.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1 <sup>st</sup> CHARGE (DAC-914178-2019)</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2. The complainant is one Teo Zhi Xing, a 38-year-old male (“Teo”). At the material time, Teo was working as a sales manager at the “Athena Jewels &amp; Watches Pte Ltd” shop located at Blk 131 Jurong Gateway #01-261, Singapore (“the shop”)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3. On 8 May 2019 at about 10.48pm, Teo called the police and informed <em>“I discovered my watch is missing from the box, valued at 20 over thousand. I suspected it was stolen by one Tan Ah Kiat SXXX HP XXX at about 2010hrs.”</em> The location provided was the shop.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4. Investigations revealed that the accused had gone to the shop on 8<sup></sup>May 2019 at about 5.30pm to enquire about selling away his ‘Rolex’ watch. However, he was informed by Teo that the watch was not authentic. It was then that the accused formed the dishonest intention to instead steal luxury watches from the shop, a building used for the custody of property, as he was in need of money.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5. Under the pretext that he was interested in purchasing genuine ‘Rolex’ watches, the accused proceeded to ask one of Teo’s colleagues to show him two ‘Rolex’ watches, one of which was a ‘Rolex’ Half R/G Yacht Master II Model 116681 (S/n: S445M629) S (“the ‘Rolex’ watch”). The accused pretended to attempt to pay for the watches by providing his particulars and furnishing an expired credit card. When the transaction was unsuccessful, the accused told Teo’s colleague that a friend of his would be coming down to make payment on his behalf. The shop assistant then temporarily placed the ‘Rolex’ watch on a table in the backroom of the shop. The accused remained in the shop and waited for an opportune moment to steal the ‘Rolex’ watch.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6. That same evening, at about 8.25pm, the accused stole the Rolex watch. While Teo and his colleague were busy and engaged with other customers, the accused stood near the door of the backroom of the shop, reached in, and removed the ‘Rolex’ watch that was placed on the table without Teo’s consent. The accused then put on the watch, before sneaking out through the rear door of the shop. The next day, on 9 May 2019, at about 1.30pm, the accused sold the ‘Rolex’ watch for S$15,000/- to the “1<sup>st</sup> Jewellery &amp; Watches” shop located at 10 Jalan Besar, #01-13 Sim Lim Tower, Singapore.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7. Teo discovered that the ‘Rolex’ watch was missing and made a Police report as stated at [3] above. The accused’s actions were recorded by CCTV cameras placed around the shop, and the accused was traced and arrested on 9 May 2019 at about 6.00pm in connection with his theft of the ‘Rolex’ watch, amongst other suspected offences.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8. S$14,372/- was recovered from the accused following his arrest. The ‘Rolex’ watch was also recovered from the “1<sup>st</sup> Jewellery &amp; Watches” shop. The accused admitted to the offence during further investigations and informed that he had already spent S$628/- on personal expenses and to pay off his gambling debts.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 2</u></b> <u><sup>ND</sup> </u><b><u>CHARGE (DAC-923086-2019)</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10.

He was later referred to Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) Woodlands Division for further investigations.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11. At the material time, the accused had been emplaced on a Halfway House programme in Teen Challenge (Singapore) Halfway House (“the Halfway House”) for the period of 13 March 2019 to 8 September 2019. This was pursuant to a Notice of Leave for Employment, Educational or Occupational Training Programme or other activity granted to the accused on 5 March 2019 by the Superintendent of Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre (“LLCSC”) under Regulation 12(1) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (“the Regulations”).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12. Investigations revealed that, on 23 April 2019, the accused failed to return to the Halfway House after his time-off. The accused was found to be uncontactable and staff at the Halfway House were unable to locate him. On 24 April 2019, the accused’s Notice of Leave was cancelled pursuant to Regulation 12(4) of the Regulations and he was accordingly required to return to LLCSC. A police gazette was issued for the accused’s arrest and he remained absent until he was arrested on 9 May 2019. The accused admitted that he had contravened the conditions of his Notice of Leave by running away from the Halfway House.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13. By failing to return to LLCSC after his Notice of Leave was cancelled, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Regulation 12(5) of the Regulations.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3rd CHARGE (DAC-923087-2019)</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14.

Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to the MDA.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18. The accused admitted that he last smoked ‘ice’ (a street name for methamphetamine) on 9 May 2019 before his arrest, alone in a coffee shop toilet at the vicinity of Jalan Besar. The accused informed that he had smoked ‘ice’ using a glass pipe attached to a straw (which was found in his possession during his arrest). The accused placed some ‘ice’ inside the glass pipe before heating the pipe using a lighter and inhaling the resulting fumes. The accused admitted that he had relapsed to smoking ‘ice’ one week after he ran from the Halfway House.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">19.

## (4)   Mitigation

14     His counsel, Mr B. Rajendraprasad tendered a written mitigation, highlighting the following factors:

> (a)     The accused is taking care of his two children and also gives money and support to his mother. His parents are divorced and his mother has cancer and his father is suffering from a heart condition. The accused committed the offences because he was desperate for money and wanted to help his family financially.

> (b)     He is deeply remorseful and has realized his mistakes and wrongdoing, and promises not to break the law in future.

> (c)     The accused has also cooperated with the Police, and he pleaded guilty at an early stage and has not wasted the court's time.

15     Counsel also urged the court to impose the minimum sentence on the accused.

## (5)   Submissions on Sentence by the Prosecution

16     The Prosecution made the following sentencing submissions for the various charges:

> (a)     DAC 914178-2019 (theft-in-dwelling charge): At least 12 months’ imprisonment as:

>> (i)       The value of the item is high (S$24,480);

>> (ii)       The offence was premeditated; and

>> (iii)       The accused has a lengthy list of property-related antecedents, including a previous stint of 9 years’ corrective training (CT) with caning.

> (b)     DAC 923086-2019 (MDR charge): at least 6 months’ imprisonment as:

>> (i)       The accused is traced for drug-related offences; and

>> (ii)       This sentence is in line with the sentences for cases set out in the table of precedents.

> (c)     DAC 923087-2019 (LT-1 charge): No objection to the imposition of the mandatory minimum punishment of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

17     The Prosecution also submitted for the imprisonment terms meted out for DAC 914178-2019 and DAC 923087-2019 to run consecutively in light of the following factors:

> (a)     Sentences for the offences attracting the longest term of imprisonment should run consecutively; and

> (b)     There were different legal interests protected for these charges.

18     In short, the Prosecution submitted that a total sentence of at least 5 years and 12 months’ imprisonment, and 3 strokes of the cane be imposed, which it argued was proportionate to the accused’s overall culpability. The DPP also indicated that the Prosecution has no objection to the accused’s imprisonment term being backdated to 7 September 2019, which was the date that the accused’s term in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre was converted to remand in prison.

## (6)   Sentencing by the Court

19     In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> (“_Raveen_”) at \[98\], the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon summarised the relevant principles to be applied for the sentencing of accused persons convicted of multiple offences. Broadly, in so far as is relevant to the present case, the approach to be adopted is as follows:

> (a)     The first stage of the sentencing analysis is for the sentencing court to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence.

> (b)     The second stage of the sentencing analysis is to determine how the individual sentences should run. The starting point of analysis is to decide whether the offences are unrelated which, in turn, is determined by considering whether they involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. “As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the CPC.”

> (c)     The third stage is to apply the totality principle to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality. “Specifically, there are two limbs to the totality principle. First, the court should examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. Second, the court should examine whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects.”

20     I now apply the above sentencing framework to the present case.

### (a)   Individual sentences to be imposed

21     The first stage of the framework requires the court to consider the appropriate sentence for each charge.

#### (i)   1st charge (theft-in-dwelling)

22     In respect of the theft-in-dwelling charge, there were various aggravating features connected with the offence.

> (a)     First, as regards the harm caused, I note that the value of the stolen item stolen was quite substantial, as the theft was of a watch that was valued at S$24,480. While this item was ultimately recovered following the arrest of the accused, the money that he had pawned the watch for i.e. $15,000, could only be partially recovered as the accused had spent $628 before he was traced and arrested.

> (b)     Second, in respect of this theft-in-dwelling offence, the accused had not simply committed the crime on the spur of the moment. Instead, the offence was committed only after the accused had carried out a series of deliberate steps, as part of an apparently well-thought out plan that he executed effectively to achieve his goal. As set out in the SOF, this involved the accused carrying out the following actions:

>> (i)       At the onset, using the pretext that he was interested in purchasing genuine ‘Rolex’ watches, the accused managed to get one of the complainant’s staff to show him two ‘Rolex’ watches, including the watch which was the subject matter of the charge.

>> (ii)       The accused then pretended to pay for the watches by providing his particulars and furnishing an expired credit card. When, as expected, this method of payment was unsuccessful, the shop assistant temporarily placed the watch on a table in the backroom of the shop.

>> (iii)       Next, the accused remained in the shop and waited for an opportune moment to steal the watch. He managed to do so by removing it from the table where it had been temporarily placed, when the complainant and his colleagues were engaged with other customers,

>> (iv)       To get away, the accused then put on the watch, before sneaking out through the rear door of the shop.

>> (v)       It was only sometime later that night, that the offence was discovered and the Police was alerted.

>> (vi)       Clearly, such planning and pre-mediation on the part of the accused is an aggravating factor that should be considered in sentencing.

> (c)     Third, aside from the charges proceeded with, the accused also had two similar TIC charges, involving theft and theft-in-dwelling offences. In this regard, in _PP v UI \[2008\] 4 SLR(R_), 500 (“_UI”_) Chan Sek Keong CJ (as he then was), in delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal, made clear how TIC offences should be regarded when sentencing an offender. At \[38\], his Honour had stated:

>> “**But, if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased** (see Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 77). This is commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences. **This would a fortiori be the case where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar in nature** (e.g., if both sets of offences consist of sexual offences against the same victim).”

\[emphasis mine\]

> Thus, in light of the above guidance of the Court of Appeal, the similar nature of the TIC charges in the present case meant that the sentence for the theft-in-dwelling charge that was proceeded with, should be enhanced accordingly.

> (d)     Fourth, it was also plainly obvious that the accused has an abysmal antecedent record, principally involving convictions on similar property related offences. In this regard, since 1996, he has been convicted of committing numerous lurking house trespass/house breaking offences, as well as offences of theft, theft-in-dwelling, and cheating. For his offences, the accused had received various forms of punishment, such as probation (which he breached), imprisonment, corrective training and caning. The heaviest custodial sentence that he had received was a term of 9 years’ corrective training (with caning) in 2006. Yet despite having had heavy sentences imposed on him, including terms of imprisonment for previous offences of theft (1 month’s imprisonment) and theft-in-dwelling (probation followed by 4 months’ imprisonment), the accused has continued to re-offend.

> (e)     Finally, the accused had committed this particular offence on 8.5.2019, which was barely 6 months after his last conviction on 20.12.2018[^2], where he had been sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

23     In addition, aside from his plea of guilt, there was really nothing exceptional raised in his mitigation plea or about his personal circumstances that would warrant any reduction in his sentence for this charge.

24     Thus, in terms of harm, culpability as well as offender-specific factors, a stiff imprisonment sentence was warranted for this offence. Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate, especially taking into account the fact that the previous terms of imprisonment and corrective training have been ineffective in keeping him on the straight and narrow.

#### (ii)   2nd charge (MDR charge)

25     As for the MDR charge, the Prosecution highlighted three cases where a sentence of 6 months imprisonment had been imposed on the offenders. I reproduce the Prosecution’s sentencing table below.

26     From the above table, it is obvious that there are many similarities between the facts of the present case, and the facts of the three precedent cases. These included the fact that the period of failure to return for all the offenders ranged from 2- 5 weeks, and the fact that in all these cases (including the present case), the offenders had a consumption charge proceeded with at the same sitting as the MDR charge. As such, I was of the view that a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment should also be imposed on the accused in the present case, similar to the sentence imposed on the offenders in each of the three precedent cases.

#### (iii)   3rd charge (LT1 charge)

27     For the LT1 charge, both the Prosecution and the Defence essentially sought for the mandatory minimum sentence to be imposed. As the accused had pleaded guilty to this charge, I saw no reason to disagree with the submissions of parties on the appropriate sentence to impose. Accordingly, for this charge, I imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

28     In summary, the sentences I imposed for the three charges are as follows:

### (b)   Global sentence

29     Moving to the second stage of the analysis set out in _Raveen_ , it was clear that so far as the three charges were concerned, the offences set out in the theft-in-dwelling charge were distinct from that in the LT1 charge, and these two offences involved the invasion of different legal interests. In contrast, the MDR and LT1 charges are both drug related and have a nexus to the accused’s previous drug involvement. This meant that while it would be appropriate to have the imprisonment sentences for the theft-in-dwelling and the LT1 charges run consecutively, the imprisonment sentence for the MDR charge should run concurrently. Thus, an appropriate global sentence would be 5 years and 12 months’ imprisonment, and 3 strokes of the cane.

30     Moving on the final stage of the analysis and applying the totality principle, it was clear that the aggregate custodial sentence of 5 years and 12 months’ imprisonment was not subtantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed i.e. that of enhanced drug consumption offence reflected in the LT1 charge. Further, bearing in mind the nature of the offences that the accused was convicted of, and his antecedents record and his personal circumstances, neither could the global sentence be said to be crushing or not in keeping with the accused’s past record and future prospects.

31     In short, in light of the facts of the case, and consistent with the applicable sentencing principles and framework discussed above, a global sentence of 5 years and 12 months’ imprisonment and caning of 3 strokes was clearly appropriate in the circumstances.

32     Finally, consistent with the positon of parties, I also backdated the imprisonment sentence to take effect from 7 September 2019, which was the commencement date of the accused’s term of remand.

33     The accused has filed an appeal against his sentence. As no stay of execution has been sought, the accused is currently serving his imprisonment term.
