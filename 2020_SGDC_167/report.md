### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

1       The accused is a 35-year-old Singaporean male. He was the registered owner of motorcar no. SJU2469P (“the motorcar”) as at 22 April 2015. Both the vehicle licence (also commonly known as the road tax) as well as policy of insurance for the motorcar had expired on 24 November 2014. He was also the registered owner of motorcycle no. FT7750X (the “motorcycle”) since 21 November 2011 but it was deregistered on 15 August 2016 due to expiry of the Certificate of Entitlement (“COE”).

2       The accused faced a total of 36 Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) charges between 25 November 2014 to 31 January 2019. They included:

> (a)     Five parking related offences for the motorcycle and vehicle nos. YM6212B and SKE5723H under the Road Traffic Rules (Cap 276, R 20) (“RTR”) and Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossings) Rules (Cap 276, R 24) (“RT(PC)R”) respectively;

> (b)     12 Electronic Road Pricing (“ERP”) related offences for the motorcar and motorcycle and vehicle nos. FBA6201T and SKE5723H under the Road Traffic (Electronic Road Pricing System) Rules 2015 (“RT(ERPS)R”);

> (c)     Three charges for failing to comply with an In-vehicle Unit (“IU”) inspection notice at an authorised IU inspection centre for the motorcycle (two counts) and vehicle no. FBA6201T pursuant to s 34E(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”) ;

> (d)     Two charges for failing to produce proof to the Registrar of Vehicles as the owner of the motorcycle and vehicle no. FBA6201T that the said respective vehicles had been exported or scrapped within one month from the date of cancellation pursuant to s 27(2) of the RTA;

> (e)     Five charges for using a de-registered vehicle when its registration had been cancelled by the Registrar of Vehicles in respect of the motorcycle (four counts) and vehicle no. FBA6201T pursuant to s 10(1) of the RTA;

> (f)     Six charges for using a vehicle for which a vehicle licence was not in force in respect of the motorcycle (3 counts), the motorcar (2 counts) and vehicle no. FBA6201T pursuant to s 15(a) of the RTA; and

> (g)     Three charges for using a vehicle when there was not in force a policy of insurance in respect of third party risks pursuant to s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) (“MVA”) for the motorcycle (2 counts) and the motorcar.

3       On 6 July 2020, the accused accepted the Prosecution’s plead guilty or PG offer and pleaded guilty before me to 24 out of the 36 charges. 12 remaining charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. Accordingly, the accused was thereafter sentenced as follows:

4       As the accused was undergoing his treatment and rehabilitation programme at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”), the accused decided to proceed with serving the grand total default sentence of 60 days’ imprisonment in DRC forthwith instead of paying the fine.

5       On 8 July 2020, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal in relation to charge Nos. LTA000178-2019-3 and LTA000178-2019-6 (i.e. charge Nos. 3 and 6 and as highlighted in grey in the table above) because he was only dissatisfied with the 12-month disqualification order imposed on him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence in relation to the two s 3(1) MVA charges.

6       Before I proceed further, I wish to highlight that there has been an omission on my part in relation to the third s 3(1) MVA charge, charge No. LTA000420-2015-2 (i.e. charge No. 8 as underlined and highlighted in blue in the table above). When I made the pronouncement on sentence in court, I had announced that for each of the s 3(1) MVA charge, the accused was fined $600 in default two days’ imprisonment. Additionally, he was disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“DQAC”) for a minimum mandatory period of 12 months with effect from the date of conviction (i.e. 6 July 2020) pursuant to s 3(3) of the MVA.

7       However, in my electronic minute sheet, I had omitted to insert the relevant disqualification order for charge No. LTA000420-2015-2 as part of my sentence. I had only done so for charge Nos. LTA000178-2019-3 and LTA000178-2019-6. Despite this, there has been no prejudice or injustice caused to the accused because the overall sentence imposed on him would still have been the same in terms of the duration of the disqualification period ordered (i.e. 12 months from 6 July 2020) if the omission did not happen.

8       On the other hand, in fairness to the accused, it was perhaps because of this omission that the accused had only appealed against charge Nos. LTA000178-2019-3 and LTA000178-2019-6 and not against charge No. LTA000420-2015-2. In the circumstances, I will deal with all these three charges in my grounds of decision for the present appeal.

### Antecedents

11     The accused was traced for similar offences like the road tax (s 15(a) RTA) and the ERP offences. He was last fined $400 on 28 March 2007 for s 15(a) of the RTA and $600 on 16 March 2009 for the ERP offence. In relation to the offence under s 3(1) of the MVA, this was the accused first offence.

12     The accused confirmed his antecedents to be correct.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

13     The Prosecution orally submitted that the usual tariff for a first offender should apply for the MVA charge and left sentence to the court.

### Mitigation

14     The accused, who was acting in person, had nothing to say in mitigation.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Section 3(1) of the MVA

15     The relevant portions of section 3 of the MVA state:

> Users of motor vehicles to be insured against third-party risks

> 3.—(1)    Subject to the provisions of this Act, it shall not be lawful for any person to use or to cause or permit any other person to use —

>> (a)    a motor vehicle in Singapore; or

>> (b)    a motor vehicle which is registered in Singapore in any territory specified in the Schedule, unless there is in force in relation to the use of the motor vehicle by that person or that other person, as the case may be, such a policy of insurance or such a security in respect of third-party risks as complies with the requirements of this Act.

> (2)    If a person acts in contravention of this section, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both.

> (3)    A person convicted of an offence under this section _shall (unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification)_ be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276) _for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction._

> (4)    A person shall not be guilty of an offence under this section if he proves —

>> (a)    that the motor vehicle did not belong to him and was not in his possession under a contract of hiring or loan;

>> (b)    that he was using the vehicle in the course of his employment; and

>> (c)    that he neither knew nor had reason to believe that there was not in force in relation to such user a policy of insurance or such security as complies with the provisions of this Act.

> … \[Emphasis added\]

16     As provided for by s 3(3) of the MVA, a person convicted of an offence under s 3(1) shall be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of 12 months for all classes of vehicles from the date of conviction. This means that in effect, the court must impose a minimum mandatory disqualification order of at least 12 months on an accused convicted under this section. It is effectively a strict liability offence. This is so unless the court thinks fit to order otherwise for special reasons.

17     Unlike the discretion in terms of disqualification found under s 42(1) of the RTA, the wordings found in s 3(3) of the MVA are different in that there is an absence of a discretion on the part of the Courts. Moreover, unlike s 42(3) of the RTA, the Courts also have no discretion to limit the disqualification imposed to only a certain class or description of motor vehicle in relation to which the offence was committed. This is because a lack of insurance coverage for vehicles on the road is a serious offence. As held by Yong Pung How CJ in the seminal case of _Stewart Ashley James v PP_ \[1996\] 3 SLR 426 at \[429G\]:

> Section 3(2) is primarily concerned with ensuring that persons using the roads take adequate steps to ensure that compensation would be available to persons involved in accidents with them. A contravention of s 3(1) is a serious offence. Of course, incidents involving such contravention would not necessarily be fatal, nor need there be any injuries at all. Nonetheless it is clear that _a strict prophylactic approach is necessary to ensure that there is adequate provision for compensation_. Taking this into account, the absence of a discretion is justified and necessary. \[emphasis added\]

18     In another case of _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span>, Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) held that the existing interpretation of “special reasons” under s 3(3) of the MVA by the Singapore Courts was a narrow one and only reasons connected with the offence and not the offender would be considered. Besides the seriousness of the offence, there is strong policy reason behind s 3(1) of the MVA, which is to ensure that victims of road traffic accidents will be able to seek compensation with mandatory motor insurance coverage. At \[38\] – \[43\], Tay J held:

> \[38\]  In short, it is insufficient for an offender to merely assert that he or she was caught in exceptional circumstances peculiar to the offence. When an offender seeks to come within the “special reasons” exception under s 3(3), “the facts to back up such circumstances must be proved to the satisfaction of the court” (_Toh Yong Soon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 147</span> at \[5\]). The hurdles which the appellants in _Sriekaran_ (\[33\] _supra_) and _Siti Hajar_ failed to cross in their appeals were not legal but factual ones. Seen in this light, it cannot be said that the application of the existing interpretation has resulted in undue harshness to offenders under s 3(1) of the MVA.

> _The policy and principle behind the existing interpretation_

> \[39\]  The policy behind s 3(1) of the MVA is to prevent the situation articulated in _PP v Hiew Chin Fong_ <span class="citation">\[1988\] 1 MLJ 467</span> at 468: “if an innocent road user is knocked down and injured or killed, he and/or his dependants may have no means of recovering from the uninsured driver any loss or damage he and/or they may have suffered or sustained”. Section 3(1) therefore seeks to ensure that compensation would be available to persons involved in accidents on the road. For that reason, a contravention of s 3(1) is a serious offence (_Stewart Ashley James v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 106</span> at \[17\]) and Parliament has deemed it fit to make the offence one of strict liability with only a limited defence in s 3(4).

> \[40\]  The seriousness of the offence is also reflected in a possible custodial sentence (s 3(2)) and a mandatory 12 months’ disqualification order (s 3(3)) that avail the judge in sentencing the offender (_Re Kanapathipillai_ <span class="citation">\[1960\] MLJ 243</span> at 245). As the Prosecution correctly observed, the policy behind the mandatory 12 months’ disqualification order is deterrence (_Sriekaran_ at \[4\]), for “a disqualification meant that for 365 days the accused person is reminded every morning of his offence” (_MV Balakrishnan_ (\[28\] _supra_) at \[9\]).

> \[41\]  Thus, even though Parliament has not unequivocally expressed how the words “special reasons” in s 3(3) are to be interpreted, I agree that, taking the seriousness of the offence and the policy behind s 3(1) into account, construing “special reasons as being those connected with the offence and not the offender would be the clearest means of giving effect to Parliament’s intention” (_MV Balakrishnan_ at \[9\]). Widening the “special reasons” exception would “encourage frivolous defences that could derogate from the policy behind \[s 3(1)\] of the MVA” (_Chua Chye Tiong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR(R) 22</span> (“_Chua Chye Tiong_”) at \[53\]).

> \[42\]  The existing interpretation of “special reasons” is not merely satisfactory on policy but it is justifiable in principle as well. Circumstances peculiar to the offence are given exceptional treatment as “special reasons” because they go towards reducing the moral culpability of the offender – _e.g._, if the uninsured offender was suddenly “called to attend \[to\] a dying relative” (_Whittall_ (\[30\] _supra_) at 201) or if it was “urgently necessary to take a sick person to hospital and the only conveyance available is a motor vehicle whose insurance has happened to run out” (_PP v Mohd Isa_ <span class="citation">\[1963\] MLJ 135</span> at 136).

> \[43\]  On the other hand, circumstances peculiar to the offender do not go towards reducing the moral culpability of the offender. They are essentially extrinsic facts about the offender which are unrelated to the offence but are produced to illicit sympathy from the court – _e.g._, being unable to work without a licence (_Chua Chye Tiong_) or requiring a licence to ferry one’s elderly grandparents for religious and medical purposes (_Siti Hajar_ (\[36\] _supra_)). These circumstances are morally distinguishable from circumstances peculiar to the offence.

#### Whether there were “special reasons” in the accused’s case

19     In the present case, the accused was imposed the minimum disqualification order of 12 months pursuant to s 3(3) of the MVA.

20     In fact, the accused had nothing to say in mitigation. There was hence no reasons given by the accused to this court as to what were the “special reasons” or could amount to such “special reasons” in the circumstances of his case for the court to order a disqualification period of less than 12 months.

21     In any case, I found that there were no “special reasons” in the accused’s present situation.

22     First, the accused was the registered owner of both the motorcar and motorcycle at all material times.

23     Next, for the motorcar, the insurance coverage had expired on 24 November 2014. When the said motorcar was detected for being used on the roads on 22 April 2015, a period of five months had since passed. Yet, the accused did nothing since the expiry of the insurance coverage to renew both the road tax and insurance of the motorcar before using the vehicle. It could not even be said to have been a momentary lapse on his part.

24     More than a year later, the same issue happened to his motorcycle. In respect of the motorcycle, the time lapse between the expiry of the motorcycle’s COE on 15 August 2016 and the two occasions the said motorcycle was detected to being used on the roads was even greater. Despite that, the accused had no qualms about using the said motorcycle. On the first occasion on 13 October 2018, it was more than two years. On the second occasion on 31 January 2019, it was almost two and a half years.

25     For all three occasions, no reasons were proffered by the accused for his lapses. The accused admitted to these facts without any qualification in the SOFs. In a nutshell, the accused’s conduct clearly indicated to me that he was in blatant disregard of the law.

26     Even assuming that I took the accused’s case at its highest based on personal circumstances, I was unable to agree that reasons like being dependent on the driving licence for a livelihood, a mistaken belief, an inadvertent oversight or that an administrative lapse had occurred over a protracted period of time for either or both the vehicles amounted to special reasons. Otherwise, the Courts will have to deal with such common excuses or frivolous defences given by accused persons on a regular basis and they no longer become “special”.

27     Finally, even if the accused were to argue that he was ignorant of the law in that he did not realise that the court was required or mandated by law to impose the 12-month disqualification order for the insurance offence, it has been a long established principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse (_ignonantia juris no excusat)._ This is so whether it is to exculpate the accused from criminal liability or be a mitigating factor in sentencing: See _Krishnan Chand v PP_ \[1995\] SLR 291 at \[7\]; _Lai Swee Lin Linda v AG_ \[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 505 at \[33\] and most recently _PP v Tan Seo Whatt Albert & anor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 156</span> at \[48\].

28     In addition, both the charges (including any order of disqualification) and the SOFs were read to the accused before he made the decision to plead guilty on his own accord without qualification. He clearly understood what he was doing when he pleaded guilty.

#### The appropriate sentence imposed

29     There are policy reasons in view of the seriousness of the offence as to why Parliament had mandated for a minimum 12-month disqualification order to be imposed pursuant to s 3(3) of the MVA when a person drives or causes or permits another to drive a vehicle when there is no policy of insurance in force at the material time. This primarily acts as a general deterrence in order to protect the public interest at large to ensure that there is insurance coverage when an accident occurs on the road. Otherwise, victims of road traffic accidents may be left without a recourse. As such, a more expansive interpretation to take into account personal circumstances should unequivocally be rejected. A stringent standard must be applied.

30     In any event, taking into account the totality of the evidence surrounding the insurance offence and for the reasons stated above, I found that there was no evidence of any “special reasons” or even very exceptional circumstances which justified a reduction or setting aside of the 12-month disqualification order for each of the occasion.

31     Furthermore, as reiterated earlier, the accused was discovered to have used a vehicle without motor insurance coverage on not only one but three separate occasions over a period of almost four years. It was fortuitous that I did not impose a longer disqualification order on him given the circumstances.

32     All things considered, I therefore found it unmeritorious that the accused is now challenging the order of disqualification imposed on him. The disqualification order, in my view, could not be considered as manifestly excessive given that this was in effect the minimum mandatory sentence required by law.

## Conclusion

33     To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="37.66%"> <col width="62.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence Ordered</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">LTA000178-2019-3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $600, in default two days' imprisonment.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period <b>of 12 months with effect from 6 July 2020</b>.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">LTA000178-2019-6</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $600, in default two days' imprisonment.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of <b>12 months with effect from 6 July 2020.</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

34     In relation to charge no. LTA000420-2015-2, for the reasons as aforementioned, I humbly urge the appellate court to exercise its powers pursuant to s 390(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to rectify the omission in the sentence earlier ordered by making the same 12-month disqualification order for all classes of driving licences on the accused from the date of his conviction (i.e. with effect from 6 July 2020).

35     Lastly, as the accused did not apply for a stay of the disqualification order pending appeal, the accused has been serving out the disqualification order imposed on him since 6 July 2020.
