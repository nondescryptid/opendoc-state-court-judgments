\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9017/2021/01-02 and MA 9901/2020/01.

7 June 2021

### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was charged for the offences of Outrage of Modesty of two female subordinates in a statutory board where he was the Director of a division. The first subordinate – “**S1**” – worked directly under the supervision of the Accused. The second subordinate – “**S2**” – was an Assistant Director and reported to the Accused in the same division.

2       The Accused originally faced nine counts but three of those charges were for offences against **S2** committed outside Singapore. These three charges of Outrage of Modesty overseas against **S2** were stood down pending the trial of the charges committed within jurisdiction. Five of the charges relate to **S1** and one charge relates to **S2**.

## The Charges

3        **S1** alleged that the Accused had behaved inappropriately towards her on many occasions. In the trial, the Prosecution framed 5 charges in relation to **S1**, based on the separate incidents on five occasions between mid-March 2016 and 13 September 2016. The Accused was charged with molesting **S1** on three occasions of hugging her so tightly that her breasts were pressing against his body; on one occasion of pressing his erect penis against her right upper arm; and on one occasion of hugging her and squeezing her buttocks.

### Five charges in relation to S1

4       The 5 charges in relation to **S1** were:

> **First charge MAC-912019-2018**,

> “You, sometime in mid-March 2016, at \[redacted address\] Singapore, did use criminal force on one \[redacted name\] female, then 41 years old, _to wit_, by hugging her so tightly such that her breasts were pressing against your body, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said \[redacted name\] and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).”

> **Second charge MAC-912020-2018**,

> “You, sometime in June to July 2016, at \[redacted address\] Singapore, did use criminal force on one \[redacted name\] female, then 41 years old, _to wit_, by hugging her so tightly such that her breasts were pressing against your body, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said \[redacted name\] and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).”

> **Third charge MAC-912021-2018**,

> “You, sometime in mid-July 2016, at \[redacted address\] Singapore, did use criminal force on one \[redacted name\] female, then 41 years old, _to wit_, by hugging her so tightly such that her breasts were pressing against your body, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said \[redacted name\] and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).”

> **Fourth charge MAC-912022-2018**,

> “You, on 13 September 2016, at \[redacted address\] Singapore, did use criminal force on one \[redacted name\] female, then 41 years old, _to wit_, by hugging her so tightly such that her breasts were pressing against your body and squeezing her buttocks, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said \[redacted name\] and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).”

> **Fifth charge MAC-912023-2018**,

> “You, on 15 June 2016, at \[redacted address\] Singapore, did use criminal force on one \[redacted name\] female, then 41 years old, _to wit_, by pressing your penis against right upper arm, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said \[redacted name\] and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).”

### Four charges in relation to S2 – only one proceeded with

5        **S2** alleged that the Accused had behaved inappropriately towards her on three different occasions when she was on official overseas trips with him and once in Singapore at her office. The 3 charges for the alleged outrages of modesty overseas were stood down by the Prosecution as there was an issue of extra-territorial jurisdiction. For the trial, the Prosecution proceeded with the one charge of the incident that happened in Singapore sometime between June and July 2016. The Accused had allegedly outraged her modesty by hugging her so tightly that her breasts were pressing against his body.

6       The one charge proceeded with by the Prosecution against the Accused in relation to **S2** reads:

> **Sixth charge MAC-912024-2018**,

> “You, sometime in June to July 2016, at \[redacted address\] Singapore, did use criminal force on one \[redacted name\] female, then 54 years old, _to wit_, by hugging her so tightly such that her breasts were pressing against your body, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said \[redacted name\] and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).”

## Facts leading up to the police report

7       To understand the context and appreciate the evidence adduced through the witnesses, it is vital to take note of the sequence of events leading up to the lodging of the police report against the Accused on 18 April 2018. The first thing of note is that the police report was not lodged by **S1** or **S2** and they did not give their consent before it was lodged. The report was made by the Director of Human Resources and Administration on behalf of the statutory board. Both **S1** and **S2** were subsequently told that they had to give their statements to the police.

### S1 spoke to her husband, her colleague (PW3) and the CE

8        **S1** testified that she spoke to her husband (PW2) at home in the same evening after the incident of 13 September 2016 – when the Accused had allegedly squeezed the buttocks of **S1** in the morning. She told her husband that she wanted to resign. Her husband told her to report to the police, but she was reluctant to do so.

9       Shortly after speaking to her husband, **S1** spoke to a senior colleague PW3 and told him of the Accused’s inappropriate behaviour. PW3 testified that **S1** told him that the Accused had brushed her arm with his lower body while they were in the office. She told him that it was not the first time the Accused had touched her inappropriately. After she had told him of her situation, he felt that he should escalate the matter and managed to arrange for her to meet with the Chief Executive (“the **CE**”) of the statutory board.

10      **S1** spoke to the **CE** sometime in 2016 after PW3 had informed the **CE** via email that **S1** had something to tell her. At the meeting, the **CE** remembered **S1** telling her about the various hugging incidents. **S1** also told the **CE** that the Accused had pressed his penis against her arm. The **CE** suggested making an official report for the board to commence an investigation but **S1** was reluctant. The **CE** then advised **S1** to report any further incidents to her.

### S2 spoke to her colleague (PW5)

11      **S2** spoke to a colleague PW5 about the Accused touching her inappropriately. PW5 advised her to speak to PW6, the Director of Corporate Services, about the matter. **S2** did not inform PW6 as she felt that it would be difficult to carry on with her work if she reported the matter. PW5 confirmed that **S2** had spoken to her of being touched inappropriately by the Accused while they were on an overseas trip together.

### The 2018 joint meeting with the CE

12     In around later 2017 or early 2018, **S1** and **S2** had some divisional matters to work on together. During a work discussion, they shared about their difficulties working with the Accused. They decided to meet with the **CE** and inform her of their working difficulties with the Accused. At this point in time, they did not know about their respective experiences of sexual harassment by the Accused.

13     Prior to the scheduled meeting with the **CE**, **S2** and **S1** met to firm up on the work issues they intended to raise with the **CE**. During this discussion, **S2** asked **S1** whether she also had a problem of inappropriate touching by the Accused. **S1** was taken aback and realised that the Accused had also touched **S2** inappropriately.

14     On 28 March 2018, during the work meeting **S1** and **S2** had with the Chief Executive (“CE”), after the discussion on work matters were concluded and **S1** and **S2** were getting ready to leave, **S2** mentioned that she had been molested by the Accused. The **CE** was shocked and became concerned that there is now more than one victim. She remembered that **S1** had earlier in 2016 told her about being touched inappropriately by the Accused.

15     The **CE** had to leave for another meeting and directed that each one of them provide details of the incidents to the Director of Corporate Services – PW6. Subsequently, an internal inquiry panel was convened, and a decision was taken to report the allegations to the police. A police report was subsequently lodged by the Deputy Director of Human Resource and Administration (PW8) on behalf of the statutory board on 11 April 2018.

16     From the unfolding sequence of events leading up to the lodging of the police report by the statutory board against the Accused; the testimonies of the husband of **S1**, the colleagues (PW3 and PW5) and the **CE**, against the express wishes of **S1** and **S2** not to blow things up, I am satisfied that there was no collusion in this case between **S1** and **S2**. I am also satisfied that there was no cross-contamination of the evidence given by **S1** and **S2**. The incidents described by each of them were separate and distinct and stood to be considered alone.

## Issues

17     There were no independent witnesses to the alleged incidents of molest. Therefore, to find the Accused guilty on all the six charges, the Court would have to be satisfied that **S1** and **S2** were telling the truth about the separate incidents of molest and that the acts of molest happened in the manner as recounted by **S1** and **S2** individually.

18     The outcome of this case depends on the assessment of the credibility of **S1**, **S2** and the Accused, as well as the veracity of their evidence on what transpired during the incidents. By veracity, I mean the accuracy of their recollection and the internal and external consistency of their evidence. In the Court of Appeal judgment of _PP v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span>, recognizing the difficulties in defining what is meant by proof beyond a reasonable doubt in cases where the sole basis for a conviction is the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness, the Court of Appeal held that what is required in the final analysis is a careful and holistic consideration of the evidence. At all times, the court remains concerned with assessing whether the Prosecution has met its burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt, no more and no less.

19     In cases where it is a question of one person’s word against another, the Court has a duty to scrutinize the testimony of the accuser and be satisfied that the Accused could be convicted on the accuser’s evidence alone. For a verdict of conviction to be pronounced on any one of the charges in this case, there can be no reasonable doubts as to the Accused having committed the alleged act or acts specified in that charge. The relevant considerations in this regard include the accuser’s demeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the accuser’s evidence.

## Verdict

20     After a review of the evidence in this case, I was satisfied that **S1** and **S2** were truthful when they said that they had each experienced sexual harassment in the form of unwelcome physical contact with the Accused. However, I was not able to find the Accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for all the five charges against him in relation to **S1**. I was only able to find the Accused guilty of the one charge, proceeded at trial, in relation to **S2**. The Accused was acquitted on the five charges against him in relation to **S1** and convicted on the single charge against him for the offence of outraging the modesty of **S2**.

## Findings and Reasons for the Verdict

21     At the end of the Prosecution’s Case, based on the testimonies of all the Prosecution witnesses, there was a _prima facie_ case against the Accused. Therefore, the Accused was called upon to enter his defence to the 6 charges against him. The Accused elected to give evidence.

22     However, before the Accused could take the witness stand, the DPP served on the Defence a materially inconsistent statement given by **S1** to the police during the investigations. The DPPs were discharging their disclosure obligations arising from the Court of Appeal case of _Muhammad bin Kadar v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span> (“the Kadar disclosure obligations”). The DPP felt compelled under the Kadar disclosure obligations to provide the inconsistent statement to the Accused.

23     In view of the materially inconsistent statement made by **S1**, the Defence applied to recall **S1** for further cross-examination. The Prosecution could not and did not object to the application. **S1** was recalled and cross-examined on her inconsistent statement.

### Doubts on the reliability of S1’s evidence after the disclosure of her police statement to the Defence

24      **S1** could not provide adequate explanations to the various material inconsistencies between her evidence in court and what she had told the police. These and other concerns raised by the Defence about the evidence of **S1** could not be ignored and the doubts cast could not be dispelled. The credibility of **S1** was seriously undermined by the disclosure of her materially inconsistent police statement, admitted as Exhibit P13. **S1** was no longer a convincing witness, let alone an unusually convincing one. These unsatisfactory aspects of the evidence of **S1** made it patently unsafe to convict the Accused on the five charges relating to **S1**.

25     The first charge that the Accused had hugged **S1** so tightly such that her breasts were pressing against his body was undermined by the materially inconsistent police statement of **S1** that her breasts did not press against him on this occasion. I agreed with the Defence’s submissions that this was a material inconsistency and it related to an element of the charge as framed. When given the opportunity to explain the inconsistency, S1 could not provide a satisfactory answer and said that it might be that she could not remember the proper sequence or due to a memory problem. The material inconsistency could not be resolved and there is no way a court would be able to find that this specific particular in the charge had been proved.

26     The second and third charges that the Accused had hugged **S1** so tightly such that her breasts were pressing against his body, apparently took place after the incident of the rubbing of the penis on her upper arm, as specified in the fifth charge, which allegedly took place on 15 June 2016. The second charge specified the period of June to July 2016 and the third charge specified mid-July 2016. Based on the objective evidence, I accepted the Defence’s submissions that the incidents for the second and third charges were in July 2016.

27     In the police statement of S1, at Paragraph 11 of P13, she explicitly stated that after the incident involving the rubbing of the penis on her arm, the Accused became wary and did not make any more “advancements” (it was clarified in evidence that it was meant to refer to sexual “advances”) on her. This unequivocal statement of S1 was materially inconsistent with S1’s allegations of when the molests specified in the second and third charges had occurred. It was also at odds with the **S1**’s allegations of molest in the fourth charge which she was certain occurred on 13 September 2016.

28      **S1** was not able to give a satisfactory explanation for the highly material inconsistencies in the time and sequence of occurrence of the alleged incidents. S1 alluded to the possibility that she simply got the timeline wrong. However, it was rightly pointed out by the Defence that her answer failed to address the crux of the matter – in that S1 had given evidence by reference to events rather than dates. It was clear from the statement that she had told the police there were no other incidents of molest after the penis incident.

29     Beyond the inconsistencies of time and sequence of events amongst the charges was the more pertinent testimony of the **CE** that **S1** did not inform the **CE** of any subsequent incidents after the penis incident. The evidence of the **CE** was that she had specifically told **S1** to report immediately to her if anything else happened. The **CE** was worried and checked with **S1** regularly after **S1** had informed her of the penis incident and the **CE** confirmed that **S1** said she was okay and there were no further incidents between **S1** and the Accused.

30     The fourth charge that the Accused had on 13 September 2016 outraged the modesty of **S1**, by hugging her so tightly such that her breasts were pressing against his body and squeezing her buttocks, was also undermined by the police statement given by **S1**, that there were no more incidents after the June 2016 incident of the Accused pressing his penis against her.

31     In relation to this fourth charge, there was an amendment to the charge in July 2019 to include the allegation that the Accused had also squeezed her buttock. When the Accused was first charged in December 2018, there was no mention of the squeezing of her buttocks, only that he had hugged her tightly. This material change raised the spectre that **S1** had belatedly included the additional act of buttock squeezing as an afterthought and cast a serious doubt.

32     On the issue of the squeezing of the buttocks, **S1** mentioned in her police statement that there were more than one instance of the Accused squeezing her buttocks when hugging her. In court, **S1** did not mention that the Accused had squeezed her buttocks for either the hugging incident in the second charge or the hugging incident for the third charge. **S1** agreed that she had changed what she had told the police in her statement when she was testifying in court. Her explanation was that the Prosecution decided to proceed on certain charges and therefore she changed her position after discussions with the Prosecution. The Defence correctly pointed out that if she was telling the truth, her evidence of the underlying factual matrix would not change even if the Prosecution elected to frame it differently. It is also to be noted that none of the witnesses **S1** had confided in – her husband, her colleague PW3 and the **CE** – mentioned being told that the Accused had squeezed her buttocks at any time.

33     The Defence raised many more points about the unreliability of **S1** as a witness and submitted that her evidence against the Accused cannot be relied upon to secure a conviction for any of the five charges involving **S1**. Based on the evidence as adduced and the obvious and material inconsistencies between the police statement of **S1** and her testimony in court, the submission is a fair one. I do not intend to repeat the less important points put in by the Defence. The Defence had more than raised a reasonable doubt on the five charges in relation to **S1**.

### Whether S1 had been truthful in her evidence of sexual harassment

34     Although the Accused is entitled to be acquitted on the five charges in relation to **S1**, it is not because **S1** had fabricated the allegations of misconduct. Having seen and assessed the evidence presented, I am satisfied that **S1** had experienced unpleasant interactions with the Accused. S1 did feel sexually harassed. She did not welcome his hugs on many occasions for which she was troubled but chose to overlook and forget. It was clear to me throughout the trial that **S1** had no intention to make any police report against the Accused. She testified that she had tried very hard and had managed to forget what the Accused had done. However, when the police report was lodged by her employers, she had to try and refresh her memory by referring to her journals. However, these journals were not produced or adduced as evidence in court.

35      **S1** came across as a witness who would rather forget about the incidents than to recount them with clarity. Nevertheless, I sensed that she would take a definite position in the course of the trial and stood by it when she was challenged, even though she might have been unsure. What this meant, in the context of this trial, was that it is highly plausible that even though she could not clearly remember an incident, she would be prepared to insist on the incident happening the way she said it did, than to concede that it might not have happened that way.

### The Accused’s denials are rejected

36     I found that the Accused cannot be believed in the evidence he gave for his defence. The unsatisfactory aspects were:

> (a)     The Accused’s evidence that it was his two female subordinates who had initiated the hugs with him was denied by **S1** and **S2** and his evidence also went against the tenor of many of the testimonies of the witnesses who had worked with the Accused.

> (b)     The Accused’s claim that he reciprocated the hugs by **S1** and **S2** on multiple occasions because he did not know how to react is incredible. His claim that it would have been awkward to refuse was unbelievable. The Accused knew very well the appropriate physical boundaries to be observed with the female staff members of the statutory board, and he could not provide any adequate explanation for him to be involved in multiple hugs with two female subordinates. The Accused conceded that any physical contact beyond handshakes between officers of the opposite sex would generally not be considered appropriate physical contact. It was not part of the office culture within the statutory board for officers to share hugs. I agree with the submissions of the Prosecution that it might be possible for the Accused to have been surprised by a spontaneous hug once, but it was difficult to accept that he was put in a “difficult position” or “cornered” into several hugs. The Accused knew that such hugs were highly inappropriate.

> (c)     Furthermore, the Accused clearly tried to play down the number of hugs he had shared with **S1**. In court, he testified categorically that he had only shared hugs with **S1** twice. He was confronted with his police statement – exhibit P14 – in which he had disclosed that he had shared five to six hugs with **S1**. He stated that “she always hugged me back” and it was a two-way thing. The Accused also mentioned that he had initiated a hug with **S1** when she was promoted in 2016. In court, he claimed that **S1** initiated that hug.

> (d)     Accused’s attempt in his police statement to say that **S1** behaved like a daughter to him, touching him on his hand to comfort him reeks of an afterthought and go against his stance that he behaved professionally with his subordinates. Also, a very different picture is painted of his persona by his own character witnesses, in fact almost all the witnesses at trial testified of his stern demeanour and distant behaviour.

> (e)     The Accused was confronted with his inconsistent accounts by the DPP and his inability to provide an adequate explanation could be seen from the following exchange:

>> “Q:    Which means to say that you and \[S1\] had hugged 5 to 6 times at least according to your answer in the police statement. Correct?

>> A:    Yes.

>> Q:    And this is completely different from what you had told me yesterday that you only shared a hug with \[S1\] on 2 distinct occasions which were unforgettable. You remember?

>> A:    Yes.

>> Q:    So, were you lying when you gave your statement to the police or were you lying in Court yesterday to all of us?

>> A:    As I was saying, right, at that point of time, lah, during the investigation, right, my mind was actually quite muddled there so I could not remember exactly there you see.

>> Q:    Look, Mr \[Accused\], your head can be very muddled at that time. But -- surely you will not fabricate more…occasions of hugging than what had actually happened. You agree? You were able to list very specific occasions here.

>> A:    I don’t know how I come to the 5 and 6 time, lah, at that moment there. But I remember question that they asked, “Is it not more than 5 time or is it not more than 3 time?” So I think when I signed the statement, I didn’t read so carefully into every aspect there.”

(NE Day 8 – from Page 63 at 10 to Page 64 at 9)

37     I accepted the submissions of the Prosecution that the Accused’s evidence in relation to the nature of the contacts reeks of an afterthought. Having said that, the deficiencies in the evidence of the Accused could not make up for the reasonable doubts raised in the evidence of **S1**.

### Conviction of the Accused for the charge in relation to S2

38      **S2** alleged that the Accused had behaved inappropriately towards her on three different occasions when she was on official overseas trips with him and once in Singapore at her office. For the trial, the Prosecution proceeded with the one charge of the incident that happened in Singapore sometime between June and July 2016. The Accused had allegedly outraged her modesty by hugging her so tightly that her breasts were pressing against his body.

39     I found the evidence of **S2** to be cogent and reliable. The fact of the hugging incident is not denied by the Accused. The Accused admitted that he had gone over to the office of **S2** to inform her of his contract renewal. However, his version is that it was **S2** who had come forward to hug him.

40     The factual issue to be resolved is whether the hug had occurred the way **S2** had described it or in the manner as described by the Accused. It was only the manner of the hugging that is in dispute and whether, by hugging her so tightly such that her breasts were pressing against his body, the Accused knew it to be likely to outrage the modesty of **S2**.

41     I accepted **S2**’s evidence on how she was hugged and rejected the version given by the Accused. I found **S2** to be forthright in giving her evidence. Her account of the incident was clear, and she withstood the cross-examination by the Defence on various aspects of possible motives for lying.

42     On the other hand, I did not accept the evidence of the Accused for the reasons I had given earlier on his lack of credibility on material evidence adduced in the trial. Furthermore, the version of the hugging incident with **S2** given by the Accused sounded contrived. There was cogency in **S2**’s testimony while the account of the Accused seemed incongruent with common conduct.

43     It was the Accused who had intentionally looked for **S2** as he had received great news, as far as he was concerned, that his contract had been renewed. He went specifically to her office to tell her the news. It was not news that **S2** was waiting to hear. The Accused and **S2** did not share a close relationship. There was no reason to expect such a piece of news to generate in her such exuberance that she would readily congratulate him by an embrace or a hug in the manner described by the Accused.

44      **S2**’s version that she had stood up to offer a congratulatory handshake was in line with the office norm attested to by all the other witnesses who worked at the statutory board. All these witnesses confirmed that they had not seen hugging amongst colleagues in the office and at best they might have seen it happen on occasions with foreign visitors from the United Kingdom.

45      **S2**’s version that she did not offer to hug the Accused was more credible than the Accused’s version that she was the initiator and had offered him a hug for which he felt awkward and unable to reject. Since it was the Accused who had taken the trouble to tell **S2** the good news, why would the Accused feel awkward? When asked why he had hugged **S2**, the Accused said that it was weird to hug and even worse not to hug her. It was a baffling answer.

46     If the Accused was telling the truth that it was **S2** who initiated the hug and he merely reciprocated, there was no reason for him to feel awkward or trapped in a social dilemma. The reason for the Accused’s baffling response was that he knew full well that such physical contact was not appropriate behavior and not a common conduct in the office between a male supervisor and a female subordinate. His version and the explanation for his actions were illogical and false. It was simply a lie and an attempt to twist the truth of what had happened as described by **S2**.

47     It was therefore noteworthy that the Accused had in his police statement, when asked on his view of physical contact with colleagues, said that “touching hands is quite ok … but hugging is more special”. He was further asked if he considered the instances of hugging **S2** to be special. His reply was that for **S2**, “I was not that close to her. So when I hugged her, it was more reciprocal and courteous/appreciative.” It was also telling for the Accused to give the following answer during cross-examination:

> “Q:    Okay. So, you agree that you were acting inappropriately just to avoid a moment of awkwardness. Agree?

> A: Between the two, yes.”

If it was true that the Accused and **S2** had only exchanged a collegiate and innocuous hug, the thought of it being an inappropriate act should not have crossed his mind as it would have been a non-issue.

48     Having observed the demeanour of **S2** in giving her evidence and preferring her version of the alleged incident of molest at her office, following a careful evaluation of both her evidence and the evidence of the Accused, I was satisfied that the charge against the Accused for outraging the modesty of **S2** had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

49     The evidence of DW2, DW3, DW4 and DW5 were not material to the verdict as they had touched on peripheral aspects of the case. They testified to the character and reputation of the Accused in the statutory board and their experiences of working with him. Also immaterial to the verdict was the testimony of PW6, when, in the course of giving her evidence in cross-examination, she alleged that the Accused had also touched her inappropriately on two occasions, about two to three years before 2016. This unexpected revelation, not being part of any of the charges, should not be and was not considered against the Accused in the analysis of the evidence.

## Sentence

50     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of nine months of imprisonment for the offence committed against **S2** by the Accused. In support of that, the Prosecution highlighted the sentencing factors and placed the case within Band 2 of the sentencing framework in the case of _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”). The Defence submitted for a non-custodial sentence and sought a fine of $3,000.

51     After hearing the submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence on sentence and giving due consideration to the circumstances of this case, the sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment for the offence in MAC 912024 of 2018 was passed against the Accused.

### Reasons for the Sentence

52     The dominant sentencing principle in this case is Deterrence. The sentencing principle of Retribution is also applicable. The offence under s354(1) of the Penal Code is punishable with up to 2 years of imprisonment, or with fine, or both. The sentencing of the offence of Outraging of Modesty _simpliciter_ is guided by the sentencing framework in the case of _Kunasekaran_.

53     The Accused was convicted after a trial. The Accused was a first offender. However, it could not be ignored that he was a senior officer in the statutory board as a divisional director. He had taken advantage of his position as the superior of a female subordinate **S2**, an assistant director in the division.

54     Based on the guidelines in _Kunasekaran_, the sentence would depend on several factors. These factors include the degree of sexual exploitation, the circumstances of the offence and the harm caused to the victim. For the conviction on the single charge for the offence against **S2**, I took into consideration the following factors in calibrating the sentence:

> a.     Offence was committed with premeditation.

> b.     Lack of remorse and subjecting **S2** to re-count and re-live the offence in court.

> c.     The degree of sexual exploitation for the convicted charge in this case is low. The hug occurred within a few seconds and there was no skin-to-skin contact.

> d.     Although the degree of sexual exploitation is low, the circumstances of the offence in this case required a custodial sentence to show that the commission of a sexual offence by a male supervisor on a female staff in the office environment cannot be condoned and has to be met with a sufficiently punitive sentence.

> e.     As for the harm caused, it was not proved that the victim’s health problems were causally linked to the incident.

55     The Accused maintained that he had not committed the offence. As there was no remorse shown, no sentencing discount could be given. Based on the aforesaid factors, the sentence for this case would be a jail term falling in the middle range of Band 1 of the sentencing framework and a sentence of imprisonment of six weeks seemed appropriate.

## Conclusion

56     At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that there were reasonable doubts cast on the evidence of **S1** in respect of proving the specific acts of molest in each of the five charges against the Accused, even though I was prepared to find that she was sexually harassed by the Accused. The Prosecution had not proven the case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt on the five charges in relation to **S1**. I had no doubts in relation to the allegations of **S2** against the Accused.

57     The Prosecution has filed an appeal against the acquittal on the five charges in relation to **S1** and an appeal against the sentence on the conviction of the charge in relation to **S2**. The Accused has filed an appeal against the conviction and the sentence for the charge in relation to **S2**. The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal. There are three remaining charges against the Accused in relation to **S2** arising out of three working trips abroad.
