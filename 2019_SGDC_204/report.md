## TIC Charges

7       The accused had separately also consented to have another 35 charges taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing.

## ANTECEDENTS

8       The accused has no previous antecedents.

## PROSECUTION SUBMISSIONS

9       The Prosecution had submitted for a global sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment, with 4 sentences to run consecutively.

## MITIGATION

10     Counsel raised in mitigation that the accused was untraced. The accused had also made full restitution. Counsel also submitted that only 3 sentences should run consecutively and that the global sentence should not exceed 7 months’ imprisonment.

## THE COURT’S DECISION

## Sentencing considerations

11     The accused was not a true first offender. She faced multiple charges involving several victims. In total, the accused had pleaded guilty to 18 charges, with a further 35 charges that were TIC. I agreed therefore with the Prosecution submission that a deterrent sentence was warranted on these facts and the other surrounding circumstances as mentioned below.

12     I note that the accused had committed multiple cheating offences over a prolonged period. In a period spanning almost 2 years between January 2014 and December 2015, the accused had committed multiple theft and cheating related offences against various victims. Further, she had misappropriated a victim’s ATM card and had made unauthorised transfers and withdrawals for her own benefit. Her actions were pre-meditated and involved planning as she even went to the extent of impersonating her romantic partner. The accused then deceived this partner’s friends into transferring monies to her on the false pretext that her partner needed monies for legal fees.

13     It cannot be ignored that the accused faced numerous charges. In total, the accused had pleaded guilty to 18 charges, with a further 35 charges that were TIC. Two charges were under s. 468 of the Penal Code, three charges under s. 420 of the Penal Code, 3 charges under s. 379 of the Penal Code and 10 charges under s. 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act. In respect of the proceeded charges, the total amount stolen and cheated by the accused was _$79,044.46._ Considering the total amount stolen and cheated by the accused by taking into account also the further 35 charges taken into consideration, the total sum more than doubles to a very significant _$193,872.77._

14     In my view, considering the gravity and the nature of the offences committed, the main sentencing consideration must inevitably be one of both general and specific deterrence.

15     Furthermore, a significant feature of this case is the large number of proceeded charges. Also significant is the large number of TIC charges – 35 TIC charges. Accordingly, I also took into account the further 35 charges which the accused had admitted and consented for these 35 charges to be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing. Here, it is apposite to note the recent observation made by Hoo J in in _PP v Tan Kok Ming, Michael_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 207</span> at \[114\] -

> _“It is trite that_ **_the effect of taking into consideration outstanding offences is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise be awarded_** _(Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 439</span> at \[19\]), and_ **_this is especially where they show persistence and recalcitrance in offending_** _(see, eg, Public Prosecutor v N <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 499</span> at \[19\]). This was clearly the case here, where there were similar modi operandi in the 1st TIC charge and the proceeded charge reflecting an escalation of offending behaviour.”_

16     In sentencing the accused, I had also considered the mitigating factors. I gave due credit to the accused in the usual manner for having decided to plead guilty. Through her Counsel, she had also expressed her remorse. I gave due weight also to the fact that she had made full restitution of what was a significant total sum involved. I also gave credit for the fact that the accused was untraced. At the same time, the accused cannot be treated as a true first-time offender, since she was charged and convicted for 18 offences which had taken place over a sustained period of almost 2 years.

#### Precedents cited

17     As the accused had been convicted of multiple charges involving different types of property offences, the Prosecution and Defence had helpfully cited several precedents to assist the Court. Indeed, both parties had referred largely to the same cases for their respective submissions on sentence. I noted that most of the authorities cited by the Prosecution were non-appealed cases or unreported decisions. At the same time, these precedents were useful as it indicated the trend of sentencing of similar cases involving similar amounts.

## The section 468 Penal Code charges

18     As for the two proceeded s. 468 Penal Code charges, it was submitted as below by the Prosecution that a 6-month imprisonment sentence per charge was in line with the following 2 precedents:

#### (a)    _PP v Lee Chee Siang <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 48</span>_

19     Here, the accused had pleaded guilty to, among other charges, two charges under section. 468 of the Penal Code. He had forged credit card application forms purportedly signed by one Ong, to cheat OCBC and HSBC into believing the applications were genuine. The amount the offender amassed on the 2 credit cards totalled $4,000 ($2,200 on the OCBC card and $1,800 on the HSBC card). A sum of $2,900 was repaid as partial restitution. The court imposed a sentenced on the accused of 6 months’ imprisonment for each charge.

##### (b)    _PP v Tok Chee Wei ( 2015 – Unreported )_

20     Here, the accused had applied for a CIMB credit card using his wife’s personal details without her consent or knowledge. The application was later approved by CIMB and the accused used the credit card for transactions amounting to $2,273.04. No restitution was made. The accused pleaded guilty under section 468 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment for this charge.

21     In view of the above 2 precedents, the Prosecution therefore asked for a similar term of 6 months imprisonment.

22     Counsel however asked for 4 months imprisonment for each of the 2 proceeded charges. This was based on the defence case cited which was _PP v Seet Choo Mong <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 364</span>_. In this case, the accused had faced 2 proceeded theft charges and 1 proceeded s. 468 Penal Code forgery charge. The accused had stolen the victim’s POSB cheque book and forged the victim’s signature to withdraw $5000. The accused was untraced. For the s. 468 Penal Code forgery charge, the accused was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment.

23     I have considered the above precedents. I note that although the amounts spent by the accused Ashlyn on the two credit cards were higher than in the above precedents, full restitution was made by the accused. I was of the view therefore that a sentence of 5 months imprisonment for each s. 468 Penal Code charge was appropriate.

## The section 3(1) Computer Misuse Act offences

24     For the s. 3(1) Computer Misuse Act charges involving unauthorised access to computer material, the Prosecution had proceeded with 10 charges and a further 4 charges were admitted and consented by the accused to be TIC.

25     As a sentencing precedent, the Prosecution had cited the case of _PP v R Balasubramaniam \[2013\] SGDC_. In this case, the accused had pleaded guilty and was convicted of, among other charges, 15 charges under s. 3(1) of the CMA. The accused had taken his wife’s ATM card without her consent and used the card to make unauthorised transfers from the wife’s account to the offender’s own account. The transferred amounts ranged from $2,600 to $6,000. Partial restitution was made. For the charges relating to transfers amounting to $4,000, the accused was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment per charge. For the charges relating to transfers amounting to $5,000 and $6,000, the Court sentenced the offender to 4 months’ imprisonment per charge. The accused had misappropriated a total sum of $61,100 for the proceeded charges.

26     The Defence in turn had cited the case of _PP v Teo Kai Lin <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 186</span>_. The accused had pleaded guilty to, among other charges, one charge under s. 3 (1) of the Computer Misuse Act. The accused had activated an ATM Debit card without the consent of the card holder in order to gain access to the bank account without authority – a charge under section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (“CMA”). The District Court sentenced the accused for this charge to 1 month’s imprisonment. On appeal, the High Court reduced the sentence for the s. 3(1) Computer Misuse Act from 1 month to 2 weeks. There were no written grounds of decision given.

27     Noting that the case of PP v _Teo Kai Lin_ involved only one proceeded s. 3 (1) CMA charge, Counsel recognising that the accused faced 10 proceeded charges and another 4 charges that were TIC, accepted that there should be an uplift from the 2 weeks imprisonment given in _PP v Teo Kai Lin._ In this regard, Counsel also referred to an earlier precedent cited by the Prosecution which was the case of PP _v Nigel Rhys Lee Kok Meng ( 2019 Unreported)._ Here, the accused faced 4 proceeded s. 3(1) CMA charges (each involving $249) and another 10 TIC s. 3 (1) CMA charges. The accused in the course of his employment had hatched a plan to exploit his Company’s computer system to submit fraudulent travel claims, which were approved and paid out. The total loss to the insurance company amounted to $3,459. Full restitution was made. The accused was sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment for each of the 4 proceeded s. 3 (1) CMA charges and with 2 sentences to run consecutively. The accused was given a global sentence of 12 weeks imprisonment. As such, Counsel submitted that the accused Ashlyn should also be given 6 weeks imprisonment for each proceeded s. 3 (1) CMA charge that she faced.

28     Having regard to the facts, I note that the accused Ashlyn had dishonestly taken Denise Tan’s ATM card and used the card to effect unauthorised cash transfers from Denise Tan’s bank account to the accused’s own account. The accused did so by keying in Denise Tan’s PIN at various ATMs. The accused then made 10 unauthorised cash transfers from 5 September 2015 to 4 December 2015 from the various ATMs. There were 8 transfers of $5,000 each, and 2 transfers of $3,000, for a total of $46,000.

29     In our present case, even though most of the sums transferred amounted to $5,000, the Prosecution’s position was that a 3-month imprisonment term for each such proceeded charge was fair. I agreed with the Prosecution. I also accepted that the _PP v R Balasubramaniam_ case is more analogous to the facts in the instant case. I noted also that the total sum involved here is a much larger $46,000 than the sum of $3,459 involved in the PP _v Nigel Rhys Lee Kok Meng_ case. Further, I have also given an uplift at this first stage of sentencing as there were also 4 TIC charges. At the same time, I have also noted that full restitution was made by the accused Ashlyn.

## The section 420 Penal Code offences

30     For the s. 420 Penal Code cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property charges, the Prosecution had proceeded with 3 charges and a further 10 charges were admitted and consented by the accused to be TIC.

31     The Prosecution had submitted that an appropriate sentence would be 3 months’ imprisonment per proceeded charge. The following precedents by the Prosecution were cited in support of this sentencing position:

##### (a)    _Ng Kwee Seng v PP <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 900</span>_

32     The offender dishonestly induced the victim into handing over $8,000 to him, by deceiving the victim that he owned a fuel bunkering business and that he could get a $4,000 return if he invested $8,000. The offender was convicted of one charge under s. 420 of the Penal Code _after trial_ and sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment for the charge. Restitution was made. The offender appealed against the sentence but the appeal was dismissed.

##### (b)    _PP v Shahrit Bin Yusop <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 38</span>_

33     Here, the offender was convicted of 3 charges under s. 420 of the Penal Code. The offender deceived victims into believing he was renting out his HDB flat unit, and induced victims into delivering the following amounts to him as alleged rental deposits: (a) $1,000 for the 1st charge, (b) $2,400 for the 2nd charge, and (c) $1,600 for the 3rd charge. No restitution was made. The offender was sentenced to 2 month’s imprisonment for each of the 1st and 3rd charges, and 3 months’ imprisonment for the 2nd charge. The 1st and 2nd charges were ordered to run consecutively.

34     Counsel had referred to 2 cases as defence precedents. In the case of PP _v Sharit bin Yusop <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 38</span>_, the accused had pleaded guilty to 3 proceeded charges under s. 420 of the Penal Code. He had conjured a scam to collect rental deposits and advance rental fees although he had no intention to rent out the Unit to the victims. Each of the 3 proceeded charges involved amounts of $1000 to $2400. No restitution was made. The accused was sentenced to 2 months imprisonment for 2 charges and 3 months imprisonment for the charge involving the sum of $2400. An appeal filed was later withdrawn.

35     Counsel also referred to a second case of _Liza bte Ismail v PP \[1997 2 SLR 459._ Here the accused had been convicted after trial of 5 charges under s. 420 Penal Code and one attempt charge under s. 420 Penal Code. The accused was employed as an accounts clerk of a credit leasing company. He was involved in raising payment vouchers and preparing cheques. The accused had deceived his Company into making pay-outs based on duplicating claims. The charges involved amounts varying from $500 to $4825. He was given sentences ranging from 2 weeks imprisonment, 1 months’ imprisonment and 2 months imprisonment. The total sentence imposed was 3 months imprisonment. The appeal against sentence was withdrawn.

36     In the present case, I note that the accused Ashlyn was convicted of 3 charges under s. 420 of the Penal Code of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property. The accused pretended to be one Meizhen, who was her romantic partner at the material time. The accused contacted three of Meizhen’s friends. The accused lied to these friends that Meizhen needed money urgently to pay lawyers’ fees, and dishonestly induced the three friends into transferring $3,000, $4,500 and $3,000 to her respectively.

37     Based on the above 2 precedents, Counsel submitted for a sentence of 2 months imprisonment.

38     I have considered all the above precedents cited by both parties. I am mindful of the presence of several sentence specific aggravating factors. First, the accused had abused the trust of her friends. Second, there was planning and premeditation by the accused as she had impersonated her partner in committing the cheating offences. I note that there were also a further 10 section 420 Penal Code charges that were TIC. It is trite that this warrants an uplift in the individual sentences – see paragraph \[15\] above, as the TIC charges also indicated persistence and recalcitrance in offending.

39     At the same time, I note that the accused had made full restitution for which I have given her due credit. I observe in passing, that the accused had made full restitution to Meizhen’s friends and the other individuals _afte_r Meizhen had confronted the accused and exposed her lies – paragraph 11 of the SOF. In the light of all these surrounding circumstances, I was of the view a 3 months’ imprisonment term for each of the 3 proceeded charges under s. 420 of the Penal Code was appropriate and fair.

## The section. 379 Penal Code offences

40     For the s. 379 Penal Code charges, the Prosecution had proceeded with 3 charges and a further 21 theft charges were admitted and consented by the accused to be TIC.

41     The Prosecution had submitted that an appropriate sentence would be 2 months’ imprisonment per proceeded charge. The following precedents by the Prosecution were cited in support of this sentencing position:

> (a)      _PP v Biak Kim Sung (DAC-927153-2018 & Ors) (Unreported)_ – the offender was the victim’s domestic helper. She stole the victim’s ATM card and made 2 withdrawals of $1,000 each (proceeded charges). For these offences, she pleaded guilty and was convicted of two counts under s. 379 of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to 1 months’ imprisonment per charge. Partial restitution of $600 was made.

> (b)      _PP v Kannan s/o Gangatharan (DAC-901400-2018 & Ors) (Unreported)_) – the offender pleaded guilty and was convicted of, among other charges, two counts under s. 379 of the Penal Code. For these charges, the offender asked the victim for his ATM card purportedly to deposit salary into his bank account (the victim was the offender’s employee). Instead, the offender withdrew $300 each on two occasions from the victim’s account. The offender was sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment per charge. No restitution was made.

42     As regards the defence precedents, Counsel had submitted that the cases cited earlier in support of the sentence to be imposed for the s. 3 (1) CMA charges were also relevant to the s. 379 Penal Code theft charges as essentially the same harm is being criminalised. Counsel also referred to the precedent of _PP v Biak Kim Sung_ cited by the Prosecution and submitted that although the amounts involved there were less than in the case of the accused Ashlyn, there was full restitution made by the accused Ashlyn unlike the accused in _PP v Biak Kim Sung_. Counsel therefore submitted for a sentence of 1 month’s imprisonment.

43     Considering the facts, I note that the accused Ashlyn had used Denise Tan’s ATM card to make unauthorised cash withdrawals. For the period, between 16 October 2015 and 27 November 2015, the accused had made three unauthorised withdrawals of $2,000 each. I note also that in the _Kannan_ case, the offender made $300 withdrawals and the Court had sentenced him to 2 months’ imprisonment.

44     As already mentioned earlier, when there are similar TIC charges involved, an uplift in the individual sentence is warranted. In this case, apart from the 3 proceeded charges, there were a significant number of _21 TIC charges of theft_. Clearly, this was evidence of persistence and recalcitrance in offending. In these circumstances, I was of the view that a 2 months’ imprisonment for each of the 3 proceeded theft charges was fair and appropriate.

#### Global sentence to be imposed

45     The Prosecution submitted for 4 sentences to run consecutively. It was submitted that a total 14-months imprisonment sentence would suitably reflect the overall criminality of the accused.

46     Counsel however submitted that only 3 sentences should run consecutively and with a global sentence of 7 months to be imposed.

47     Concerning the global sentence to be imposed, I note the observations of the Court of Appeal in _ADF v PP and Another \[_2010\] 1 SLR 874. It was held at paragraph \[146\] -

> _“146_.     _Multiple wrongdoing by a multiple wrongdoer as a general rule must be viewed more severely than single offending involving similar offences…An order for more than two sentences to run consecutively ought to be given serious consideration in dealing with distinct offences when one or more of the following circumstances are present\[:\]” (a) dealing with persistent or habitual offenders, (b) there is a pressing public concern in discouraging the criminal conduct, and (c) there are multiple victims and (d) other peculiar cumulative aggravating features are present.”_

48     In the more recent case of _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ stated at paragraph \[66\] that –

> _66_.     _By stating explicitly that the individual sentence that would otherwise have been imposed is being recalibrated by reason of the totality principle_, _the sentencing judge not only demonstrates principled adherence to the applicable sentencing benchmarks but also ensures that the integrity of those benchmarks for the discrete offences is not affected by the recalibration that he has done in the particular case that is before him by reason of the particular facts and circumstances at hand.”_

49     Sundaresh Menon CJ also endorsed the views of VK Rajah JA in _ADF v PP_ and further stated at paragraphs \[78\] to \[79\] that -

> _“78     Second, in situations where the court is dealing with multiple sentences, the sentencing judge must be vigilant to ensure that aggravating factors are not counted against the accused twice over. This was a point made well by V K Rajah JA in ADF (\[45\] supra), where_ **_he highlighted the important distinction between sentence specific aggravating factors and cumulative aggravating features_**, _at \[92\]:_

> _92\. Here, I should pause and highlight the sometimes overlooked distinction between sentence specific aggravating factors and cumulative aggravating features. Where multiple distinct offences have been committed, sentencing is a two-stage process. First, the sentence for each individual offence had to be determined. Second, the court has to determine whether the sentences for these multiple offences ought to run concurrently or consecutively and if consecutively, which combination of sentences ought to be made and whether the overall sentence properly comprehends the criminality of the multiple offender………._ **_As the possibility of an overlap may occur in some cases, care must be taken not to re-input an aggravating consideration at the second stage, if it has already been fully factored into the sentencing equation during the first stage._** _\[emphasis in original\]_

> _79_      **_I agree with thi_** _s. In choosing which of the multiple sentences of imprisonment should run consecutively and which concurrently_, **_the sentencing judge should not take into account aggravating factors that were already taken into account at the first stage of sentencing and to decide that on account of those factors a combination of longer sentences is called for.”_**

> _(Emphasis added)_

50     Applying the above principles, I note that the forgery and cheating and computer misuse offences committed by the accused are of a serious nature and there is a public interest to deter such criminal conduct. The accused’s offences also involved forgery for purposes of cheating and credit card abuse. Such offences are serious as they affect the financial integrity of the Singapore banking system and the global status of Singapore as a financial hub. Further, the offences committed by the accused involved not one but multiple victims. Under these circumstances and to reflect the totality of the criminal conduct of the accused, I was of the view therefore that 4 sentences should run consecutively.

## Conclusion

51     The accused was accordingly sentenced on the 18 proceeded charges as follows –

52     Having considered the totality of the accused’s criminality, I was of the view that 4 sentences should run consecutively, namely DAC-919711-2017, DAC-919742-2017, MAC-905086-2017 and MAC-905118-2017. The global sentence imposed is therefore 13 months imprisonment.

53     The accused is presently on bail pending appeal. I have ordered a stay on the execution of the sentence of imprisonment.
