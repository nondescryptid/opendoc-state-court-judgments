### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       Crime can strike anywhere. Including on cruise ships. Indeed, these “floating cities”[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) – which have a high concentration of holiday makers with possibly a lowered sense of self-inhibition and security consciousness – can be a fertile ground for crime. If a passenger commits a criminal act on a non-Singapore registered ship (“**foreign ship**”) on the high seas, can that passenger be held criminally liable under Singapore law? This important issue – which appears to have eluded consideration by Singapore courts thus far – is raised in the present case.

## Charges

2       The accused person in the present case is Ng Kok Wai (“**the Accused**”), a Singapore citizen. He is alleged to have committed the following offences while being a passenger on the “World Dream” (a Bahamas-registered cruise ship) on the South China Sea:

> (a)     An offence punishable under s 451 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”) read with s 180 of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 179, 1996 Rev Ed) (“**Merchant Shipping Act**”) for having allegedly climbed over the balcony of the cabin room of another passenger (“**victim**”) to gain access into the victim’s cabin room in order to commit theft (“**House-breaking Charge**”).

> (b)     An offence punishable under s 380 of the Penal Code read with s 180 of the Merchant Shipping Act for having allegedly dishonestly taken a bra and one luggage out of the victim’s cabin room (“**Theft Charge**”).

## Preliminary Legal Issue

3       The Accused has claimed trial to his charges. The Defence submitted that the Accused cannot be held criminally liable even if the elements of the House-breaking Charge and Theft Charge are made out. This is because the acts are alleged to have taken place outside Singapore. According to the Defence, the Penal Code provisions which are relevant to his charges – namely, s 378, s 380, s 441, s 442 and s 451 (“**the Relevant Penal Code Provisions**”) – do not apply extraterritorially.

4       Before proceeding with the Accused’s trial, the parties agreed that I should first determine whether the Relevant Penal Code Provisions can apply extraterritorially (“**Preliminary Legal Issue**”).

## Prosecution’s submissions

5       It is not disputed that the Relevant Penal Code Provisions, _on their own_, do not apply to criminal acts committed on a foreign ship on the high seas. To extend the Relevant Penal Code Provisions extraterritorially in this case, the Prosecution relied on s 180 of the Merchant Shipping Act. It was submitted that s 180 has two legal effects. First, it extends the Relevant Penal Code Provisions to criminal acts committed extraterritorially on ships. Second, s 180 confers on Singapore courts the jurisdiction to try such criminal acts. The Prosecution further submitted that save for one difference, s 178 of the Merchant Shipping Act has similar legal effects as s 180. That difference is this – s 178 applies only to offences under the Merchant Shipping Act while s 180 applies more broadly to all offences under Singapore criminal law. The Prosecution explained that this is why they had chosen to rely on s 180 – and not s 178 – as the legal basis to prosecute the Accused.

## Defence’s submissions

6       According to the Defence, s 178 and s 180 merely confer on Singapore courts the jurisdiction to try offences under the Merchant Shipping Act committed extraterritorially. They do not render extraterritorial acts punishable as offences under Singapore law. To interpret s 178 and s 180 otherwise would be inconsistent with the text and legislative history of these two provisions, as well as established case law and policy. Finally, the Defence submitted that even if s 180 does have extraterritorial effect, that provision applies only to persons who trespass on ships – and not to passengers such as the Accused.

## Key issue for determination

7       Given the parties’ submissions, the Preliminary Legal Issue can thus be further refined as follows:

> Do s 178 and/or s 180 of the Merchant Shipping Act have the effect of extending the Relevant Penal Code Provisions to acts committed by a passenger on a foreign ship outside Singapore?

## Applicable principles

8       Before addressing the Preliminary Legal Issue, it is helpful to first set out the applicable principles. In this regard, it is well-established that two _distinct_ requirements must be met before an accused person can be tried and convicted for acts that he has committed outside Singapore.

### 1st Requirement – Provision that criminalises acts outside Singapore

9       The first is that there must be a statutory provision that _expressly_ criminalises acts committed outside Singapore (“**ambit extension provision**”). In the absence of such a provision, there is a presumption that a criminal enactment is not intended to apply extraterritorially. This presumption arises out of respect for the sovereignty of other nations: _Public Prosecutor v Taw Cheng Kong_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 489</span> at \[66\] – \[69\] and \[88\]; _Public Prosecutor v Pong Tek Yin_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 1 SLR(R) 543</span> (“**_Pong Tek Yin_**”) at \[13\], \[14\], \[16\] – \[21\].

10     There is _no single_ or _“standard” formulation_ for ambit extension provisions. My research reveals that there are at least four different ways in which such provisions have been formulated. These are set out in **Annex B**.

### 2nd Requirement – Provision that confers jurisdiction on courts to try offence

11     The second requirement is that a court trying an accused person on a charge involving an extraterritorial offence must have the _jurisdiction_ – i.e., the authority to hear and determine – the charge. As courts are creatures of statute, this authority must be established by legislation (“**venue provision**”): _Muhd Munir v Noor Hidah_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 348</span> at \[19\]; _Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 258</span> at \[13\] – \[16\] and \[20\].

12     Section 50 of the State Courts Act 1970 (“**State Courts Act**”) and s 15(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (“**Supreme Court of Judicature Act**”) are oft-cited examples of venue provisions: _Public Prosecutor v Quek Chin Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 138</span> at \[9\]; _Pong Tek Yin_ at \[7\] – \[14\]; second reading speech for the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill (No. 12 of 1993) in Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (13 April 1993) vol 61 at cols 130 – 137.

## My decision

### Ruling on Preliminary Legal Issue – Summary

13     Having set out the applicable principles, I now come to the Preliminary Legal Issue. After considering the parties’ submissions, I find that –

> (a)     Section 178 is an _ambit extension provision_. In other words, it has the effect of extending the Relevant Penal Code Provisions to criminal acts committed on foreign ships outside Singapore.

> (b)     Section 180 is a _venue provision_. It authorises courts to try offences under the Relevant Penal Code Provisions committed extraterritorially.

14     I will now explain how I had come to the above findings.

### Approach to statutory interpretation

15     To address the Preliminary Legal Issue, I would need to determine how s 178 and s 180 ought to be interpreted. In approaching this task, I adopted the purposive interpretation approach which involves the following steps: _Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 373</span> and _Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 850</span> (“**_Tan Cheng Bock_**”):

> (a)     First, ascertain the possible interpretations of s 178 and s 180, having regard to both the ordinary meaning and the context of these provisions within the Merchant Shipping Act. (“**Step 1**”)

> (b)     Second, ascertain the legislative purpose of s 178 and s 180. This purpose may be discerned from the language used in these provisions. (“**Step 2**”)

>> (i)       If the ordinary meaning of s 178 and s 180 is clear, then extrinsic material can only be used to confirm the ordinary meaning but not to alter it.

>> (ii)       If the ordinary meaning of s 178 and s 180 is ambiguous or will lead to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable result, then extrinsic material can be used to ascertain the meaning of these provisions.

> (c)     Finally, compare the possible interpretations against the purposes of s 178 and s 180 and select the interpretation that best advances the purpose of these provisions. (“**Step 3**”)

### Interpretation of s 180

#### The elements of the provision

16     I begin my analysis with s 180 since this is the provision relied on by the Prosecution to extend the Relevant Penal Code Provisions extraterritorially in this case. The full text of s 180 is in **Annex A**. For ease of understanding, s 180 can be broken up into its elements as shown in the right column below. My comments are reflected in the left column.

#### Section 180 is a venue provision

17     To recap, both the Prosecution and the Defence had agreed that s 180 is a venue provision. This is because it confers on a court the “jurisdiction to try” an offence committed extraterritorially on a foreign ship. According to s 180, the offence can be tried “_as if_” it had been committed on a Singapore ship “within the limits of the court’s ordinary jurisdiction”. Given that courts ordinarily exercise jurisdiction within the territorial limits of the States by which they are established, s 180 is in effect stating that a Singapore court has the authority to try a criminal act committed extraterritorially as if that act had been committed on a Singapore ship in Singapore.

#### Text in s 180 does not show it to be an ambit extension provision

18     The Prosecution submitted that in addition to being a venue provision, s 180 is _concurrently_ an ambit extension provision as well. The Prosecution supported this submission with three lines of argument.

19     The first line of argument is premised on the following words at the end of s 180 (“**the Words**”):

> … that court shall have jurisdiction to try the offence **_as if_** _it had been so committed_.

> \[emphasis added\]

20     The Prosecution contended that by deeming (“as if”) extraterritorial criminal acts to have been committed in Singapore, the italicised part of the Words in effect extends Singapore criminal law extraterritorially.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

21     I am unable to accept the Prosecution’s contention. On a plain reading, s 180 does not go so far as to (a) extend Singapore criminal law extraterritorially or (b) provide the legal basis for charging persons for committing offences extraterritorially. The italicised part of the Words simply means that _if_ a person is charged with having committed an extraterritorial offence, then a court _can try_ the offence _as if_ it had been committed in Singapore. Clearly, s 180 _assumes_ that there is another provision which provides the legal basis for “charging” the accused person in the first place. In my view, clearer words – such as those in **Annex B** – are needed before Parliament can be taken to have intended s 180 to be an ambit extension provision.

#### English cases are unpersuasive

22     The Prosecution’s second line of argument as to why s 180 should be an ambit provision is based on two English decisions – _R v Kelly_ <span class="citation">\[1982\] AC 665</span> (“**_Kelly_**”) and _Re Adrian David Cumberworth_ (1989) 89 Cr App R 187 (“**_Cumberworth_**”). These decisions considered s 686(1) of the U.K. Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (“**U.K. Act**”). This is the provision on which s 180 is based. (For fuller details of the legislative history behind s 180, see **Annex C**.)

23     In _Kelly_, the appellants (who were British subjects) were convicted of an offence under s 1 of the U.K. Criminal Damage Act 1971 for having damaged the fittings on a Danish ship. The appellants appealed against their conviction, arguing that their “offence” did not come within s 686(1) of the U.K. Act as the damage was committed on a foreign ship on the high seas. The House of Lords dismissed the appeal. Delivering the judgement of the House, Lord Roskill held that s 686(1) was an ambit extension provision: at page 676E – H and 678A. Lord Roskill came to this view based on the following reasoning process:

> (a)     His Honour began by observing that if s 686(1) was merely a venue provision, then the provision would have negligible practical effect.

> (b)     Lord Roskill then postulated that it was more likely that the legislative intent behind s 686(1) “was to enable miscreant British subjects on foreign ships to be dealt with in the courts of the place where they were ‘found’”.

> (c)     Finally, Lord Roskill held that the word “offence” which appears in s 686(1) pointed the way to the correct construction of the provision.

24     I decline to adopt the interpretation in _Kelly_ that s 686(1) is an ambit extension provision to s 180. I note that there are significant differences between s 686(1) and s 180. These differences are highlighted below:

>

**Section 180**

 | 

**Section 686(1)**

 |
| 

Where any person

 | 

Where any person,

 |
|

 | 

which would have had cognizance of the offence if it had been committed on board a _British_ ship within the limit of its ordinary jurisdiction,

that court shall have jurisdiction to try the offence as if it had been so committed.

 |

  
  

> \[emphasis and text in square brackets added\]

25     As is evident from above, s 180 does not require either the accused person to be a Singapore citizen, or the offence to have been committed on a Singapore ship, before that provision is applicable. This is unlike s 686(1) where either the accused person or the ship must be British. This significant difference came about when the current formulation of s 180 was introduced _vide_ the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 (No. 19 of 1995). It is unclear why Parliament had chosen to depart from the former formulation of s 180 which is similar to s 686(1). During the short second reading of the Merchant Shipping Bill in 1996, it was stated that the Marine Department had done a complete review of the previous Act, removed obsolete provisions and updated certain provisions. No reference was made to s 180 either in the second reading speech or in the explanatory statement accompanying the Bill.

26     In any event, I do not find _Kelly_ to be helpful on how s 180 ought to be interpreted:

> (a)     First, I agree with the Defence that Lord Roskill appears to have “wholly gloss\[ed\] over the plain meaning of s 686(1) of the 1894 Act in favour of a purposive reading”.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) Lord Roskill’s approach in interpreting s 686(1) is not consistent with how Singapore courts would interpret a statutory provision: see \[15\] above.

> (b)     Second, Lord Roskill did not provide any basis (e.g., by referring to extrinsic material) for his view that the purported legislative intent behind s 686(1) was to deal with “miscreant British subjects”. It bears noting that apart from British subjects, s 686(1) is also expressly stated to be applicable to “\[_non_\-British subjects who are\] charged with having committed any offence on board any British ship on the high seas”.

> (c)     Third, Lord Roskill did not explain why the word “offence” in s 686(1) shows that the provision is an ambit extension provision. I note that the word “offence” _similarly appears_ in s 15(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and s 50(2) of the State Courts Act. It is not disputed by the Prosecution and the Defence that s 15(1) and s 50(2) are venue provisions only and that the presence of the word “offence” did not turn them into ambit extension provisions.

> (d)     Finally, I note that Lord Roskill’s decision that s 686(1) is an ambit extension provision has been criticised: Geoffrey Marston, _Crimes by British Passengers on Board Foreign Ships on the High Seas: The Historical Background to section 686(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894_, (1999) 58 Cambridge L.J. 171 (“**Marston’s Article**”) at pages 194 – 195; Law Reform Commission of Canada, Working Paper 37, _Extraterritorial Jurisdiction_ (1984) (“**Law Reform Paper**”) at pages 41 – 42.

27     I now turn to the second English case relied on by the Prosecution. In _Cumberworth_, the appellant (a British subject) was convicted of common assault committed on a French ship. At the material time, the ship was in a French port and the passenger gangway was in position. The appellant appealed against his conviction, arguing that that the trial court was wrong to have decided that it had jurisdiction under s 686(1) to try him when the offence, if any, was committed on a foreign ship in a foreign port. The English Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. I do not find _Cumberworth_ to be of much assistance in interpretating s 180. This is because apart from citing _Kelly_ and stating that the language in s 686(1) was “not limited in any way”, the court did not provide any other reason for holding that s 686(1) was an ambit extension provision.

28     To be clear, while I am unimpressed by the reasons given in _Kelly_ and _Cumberworth_ for finding s 686(1) to be an ambit extension provision, this does not mean that the appellants in these cases had been wrongly convicted. Section 684 of the U.K. Act – which is _in pari materia_ to s 178 of the Merchant Shipping Act – was not considered in _Kelly_ and _Cumberworth_. For the reasons to be provided shortly, I am of the view that s 178 – and consequently s 684 – is an ambit extension provision. In other words, s 684 could have provided the legal basis for the convictions in _Kelly_ and _Cumberworth._

#### Section 182 does not assist the Prosecution’s case

29     Finally, the Prosecution’s third line of argument as to why s 180 should be an ambit provision is based on s 182 of the Merchant Shipping Act. (The full text of this provision is at **Annex A**.) The Prosecution’s analysis is as follows. Section 182 is a venue provision. Since Parliament does not legislate in vain, s 180 could not have been intended to duplicate the function of s 182. Accordingly, s 180 must have been intended to be an ambit extension provision.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

30     I am unable to agree with the Prosecution’s analysis. It contradicts their case that s 180 _is_ a venue provision. In any event, I do not see why s 180 would be duplicating the function of s 182 just because it (i.e., s 180) is a venue provision. The two provisions are very different in terms of their (1) purpose and (2) scope. These differences are set out in Table 1 below:

#### “… any offence …”

31     Before turning to s 178, I wish to address two issues raised by the Defence regarding the interpretation of s 180.

32     The first interpretation issue relates to the phrase “any offence” in s 180. According to the Defence, that phrase should be read as “any offence _under the Merchant Shipping Act_”. The Defence’s basis for this view are as follows:

> (a)     There is nothing on the face of s 180 to show that it is intended to refer to offences outside of the Act. Since the phrase “any offence” appears in the Merchant Shipping Act, it must refer only to those offences in the Act.

> (b)     Furthermore, the phrase “any offence” in s 180 must be read consistently with a similar phrase in s 178. According to the Defence, the phrase “every offence” in s 178 “clearly refers only to offences under the Merchant Shipping Act”.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

33     I reject the Defence’s submissions which I find to be devoid of merit.

> (a)     The Defence’s submissions are not supported by a plain reading of s 180. The phrase “_any_ offence” appears without any qualification in s 180. There is nothing in the provision to suggest that the phrase refers to offences under the Merchant Shipping Act only. If the phrase “any offence” in s 180 was intended to mean “any offence _under the Merchant Shipping Act_”, then Parliament would have expressly stated this to be so, as it had done in s 182 and s 192 of the Merchant Shipping Act: see **Annex A**.

> (b)     Contrary to the Defence’s submissions, I find that the phrase “every offence” in s 178 is not limited to offences under the Merchant Shipping Act only: see \[46\] – \[48\] below.

34     In summary – on its _plain meaning_, the phrase “any offence” in s 180 refers to any act or omission which has been defined to be illegal in any Singapore legislation. This will include the Relevant Penal Code Provisions.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

#### Person who “… does not belong …” to the ship

35     The second interpretation issue raised by the Defence concerns the following words in s 180:

> “Where any person is charged with having committed any offence … on board any foreign ship _to which he does not belong …_”

> \[emphasis added\]

36     The Defence submitted that passengers who are lawfully on a ship (like the Accused) “belong to” the ship and thus would fall outside the above words in s 180. The Defence gave two reasons for taking this view.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

37     First, the Defence highlighted that s 147(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act contains a similar phrase “belonging to the ship”. The Defence pointed out that s 458 of the U.K. Act – which is similar to s 147(1) – had been considered in _The Fusilier_ (1864) 34 LJ (Adm) 25 (“**_The Fusilier_**”). There, the court held that the phrase “belonging to the ship” included a ship’s passengers. According to the Defence, s 180 ought to have the same interpretation.

38     I am unable accept the Defence’s submission that just because similar phrases (“belong to”/“belonging to” to a ship) appear in both s 147(1) and s 180, the same interpretation should be adopted for these phrases. This is because the interpretation of the phrase must necessarily depend on the _context_ in which it has been used. I will illustrate this point with two examples.

> (a)     Section 147 deals with the duty of a receiver where a ship has been wrecked, stranded or in distress. Under s 147, the receiver is required to (i) proceed to the location of the ship, (ii) “take the command of all persons present”, and (iii) “assign such duties and give such directions to each person as he thinks fit _for the preservation of the ship and of the lives of the persons belonging to the ship (referred to in this Part as shipwrecked persons) and of the cargo and apparel of the ship_”. In such a situation which concerns the preservation of lives and property, it is unreasonable to suggest that the receiver is required to save the lives of the crew only and not those of the passengers. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that the court in _The Fusilier_ held that the words “persons belonging to the ship” included passengers.

> (b)     The words “person belonging to a ship” also appear in s 187(1)(b) of the Merchant Shipping Act. That provision states that –

>> **Service of documents**

>> 187.—(1) Where for the purposes of the Act, any document is to be served on any person, that document may be served –

>>> …

>>> (b)    if the document is to be served on the master of a ship, where there is one, or _on a person belonging to a ship_, by leaving the document for him on board that ship with the person being or appearing to be in command or charge of the ship; …

>>> \[italics added\]

> (c)     Clearly, in the context of s 187(1)(b), the words “person belonging to a ship” would not include the ship’s passengers. It is absurd to suggest that legal documents intended for the ship’s master can simply be left with a mere passenger.

39     When construing the words “belong to” in s 686(1) of the U.K. Act, Lord Roskill held in _Kelly_ that no one “using ordinary language would for one moment describe the appellants \[who were passengers\] to belong to the \[ship in question\]”. Lord Roskill further held that passengers did not, by virtue of their transient presence on board a ship, “belong” to a ship: at page 678F – G. I agree with Lord Roskill. The ordinary meaning of the words “belong to” in s 180 refers to someone “_being a member of_ \[something\]”.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

40     Section 180 is not concerned with protecting the lives and safety of persons and property on a ship – unlike s 147(1). It is concerned with conferring jurisdiction on courts to try extraterritorial offences committed on ships. In this context, there is no good reason why passengers should be considered to “belong to” the ship and thus be immune from being tried for their offences on ships. On the contrary, there are good reasons why courts should be able to try such persons: see \[61\] below.

41     The Defence’s second reason as to why passengers should be considered to “belong to” a ship under s 180 is based on the legislative history of s 11 of the U.K. Merchant Shipping Act 1867. According to the Defence, s 180 originated from s 11. These two provisions are set out below for comparison:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"><col width="50%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Section 11 Merchant Shipping Act 1867</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Section 180 Merchant Shipping Act</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">If <b><em>any British subject</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Where <b><em>any person</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">commits any crime or offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">is charged with having committed any offence</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">on board any British ship,</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">on board any Singapore ship on the high seas or elsewhere outside Singapore</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">or on board any foreign ship to which he does not belong,</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">or on board any foreign ship to which he does not belong</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">any Court of Justice in Her Majesty's dominions, which would have had cognizance of such crime or offence if committed on board a British ship within the limits of the ordinary jurisdiction of such Court,</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">and that person is found within the jurisdiction of any court in Singapore which would have had cognizance of the offence if it had been committed on board a Singapore ship within the limits of its ordinary jurisdiction, that court</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the case as if the said crime or offence had been committed as last aforesaid.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">shall have jurisdiction to try the offence as if it had been so committed.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

42     The Defence submitted that s 11 was enacted to deal specifically with offences by British subjects who forcibly set upon foreign ships – not offences by passengers who were already on the ship. The Defence relied on the following second reading speech on the Merchant Shipping Bill 1867 to support their submission:[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

> \[Clause 11\] provided for the punishment of men who committed offences against foreign vessels. On a recent occasion a small French vessel stranded near the English coast was set upon by some men of Harwich, the captain was subjected to violence, and the ship was taken possession of; yet the offenders escaped unpunished, because their offence was committed on a foreign vessel outside British soil. A remedy for this defect in our law was provided in the clause he spoke of, by providing that the offender shall be punished in the same way as if the offence had been committed against an English ship.

43     In my view, the historical background to the enactment of s 11 should not fetter how Singapore courts interpret the phrase “belong to” in s 180. This is because whatever might have been the considerations that triggered the enactment of s 11 in the U.K., such considerations are of limited value in interpreting s 180 given the following.

> (a)     Section 180 goes far beyond the intent behind s 11 of dealing with British subjects who forcibly set upon stranded foreign ships. On a plain reading, s 180 covers “any person” who commits “any offence” on a ship.

> (b)     In these circumstances, extrinsic material such as the second reading speech on s 11 cannot alter the plain meaning of the words “belong to” in s 180: _Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[50\]. In matters of statutory interpretation, Singapore courts accord primacy to the text of a provision and its statutory context _over extrinsic material_: _Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[43\], \[48\] and \[54(c)(ii)\]. The reasons for this are simple. First, in order to find out what the law is, the public must be able to rely on the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of a provision without having to expend effort and time to locate historical and inaccessible extrinsic material: s 9A(4) of the Interpretation Act 1965. Second, it is also important that legislation be interpreted and applied to deal with _current_ situations and not historical scenarios. If s 180 is to be construed based on the motivations of colonial draftsmen and concerns of the British Parliament in 1867 only, then the provision would have lost its relevance long time ago: _Tan Seng Kee v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] 1 SLR 1347</span> (“**_Tan Seng Kee_**”) at \[112\].

> (c)     Finally, the extrinsic material in the present case is a piece of _foreign_ legislation and a second reading speech in the _British_ Parliament _more than 150 years ago_. Courts are especially cautious about relying on extrinsic material which pre-dates 1993, i.e., the date s 9A of the Interpretation Act was enacted. This is because a fine-grained analysis of extrinsic material in such a situation is entirely artificial: _Tan Seng Kee_ at \[177\].

44     In summary, I rule that in the context of s 180, passengers do not “belong to” a ship.

### Interpretation of s 178

#### The elements of the provision

45     I now come to s 178 of the Merchant Shipping Act. The full text of the provision is at **Annex A**. For ease of understanding, the parts of s 178 which are relevant to the present case can be broken up into its elements as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.92%"><col width="79.08%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>First Part</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">For the purpose of giving jurisdiction under this Act,</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="4" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Second Part</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">every offence</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">shall be deemed to have been committed,</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">either in the place in which the offence actually was committed</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">or in any place in which the offender may be.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

#### Section 178 is not confined to only offences under the Merchant Shipping Act

46     Before explaining my reasons for finding s 178 to be an ambit extension provision, I wish to first deal with the Prosecution and the Defence’s position that s 178 applies only to offences _under the Merchant Shipping Act_. (“**Narrow Meaning**”)

47     In my view, there is no basis to adopt the Narrow Meaning:

> (a)     On a plain reading, there is no restriction on the types of offences that can come within s 178. The phrase “under this Act” in s 178 qualifies the word “jurisdiction” (which comes _immediately before_ the phrase), and not the words “every offence” (which come _after_ the phrase). Accordingly, there is no reason to read “every offence” and “under this Act” conjunctively.

> (b)     Importantly, the use of the words “_every_ offence” in s 178 can be contrasted with s 182 and s 192 of the Merchant Shipping Act. (For the full text of s 182 and s 192, see **Annex A**.) Sections 178, 182 and 192 are all located in Part X of the Act. In s 182 and s 192, the phrase “any offence _under this Act_” has been used. This clearly shows that if Parliament had intended the Narrow Meaning to be applied to s 178, this intent would have been expressly stated.

> (c)     The Defence sought to support the Narrow Meaning by relying on _R v Liverpool Justices, ex parte Molyneux_ \[1972\] 2 WLR 1044 (“**_Molyneux_**”) at 1035E.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) In that case, the court held that the words “every offence” in s 684 of the U.K. Act – which is in _pari materia_ to s 178 – referred to offences under the U.K. Act only. I decline to follow _Molyneux_ as the court there did not give any reason to explain why the words “every offence” should be interpreted so narrowly.

> (d)     The Defence also referred me to s 9 of the Canada’s Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. According to s 9, s 681 of the Canada Shipping Act applies to offences under the Canada Shipping Act only. Section 681 is identical to s 178 of the Merchant Shipping Act. The Defence submitted that given the position taken in s 9, the words “every offence” in s 178 should likewise be interpreted as referring to offences under the Merchant Shipping Act only.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) I reject this submission. I do not see why a piece of Canadian legislation, which has no equivalent in Singapore, should determine how Singapore courts interpret s 178.[^15]

> (e)     In rejecting the Narrow Meaning, I am mindful that the explanatory statement to the 1995 Merchant Shipping Bill reads: “Clause 178 makes provision as to jurisdiction in respect of offences _under the Bill_”.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) \[emphasis added\] The explanatory statement appears to be inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the words “every offence” in s 178. Given the considerations highlighted in \[15\] and \[43(b)\] above, the words “every offence” will have to be construed based on their ordinary meaning, and the explanatory statement cannot alter this meaning.

48     In summary, based on their ordinary meaning, the words “every offence” in s 178 mean every act or omission which has been defined to be illegal in any Singapore legislation. This meaning is similar to the one in s 2(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 which defines “offence” as “an act or omission punishable by any written law”.

#### Second Part of s 178 renders persons liable for extraterritorial criminal acts

49     I will now explain why I am of the view that s 178 is an ambit extension provision.

50     On a plain reading, the Second Part of s 178 clearly deals with extraterritorial criminal acts. It refers to a situation where “the place in which the offence actually was committed” (“**location A**”) is different from the place where the offender is later found (“any place in which the offender may be”) (“**location “B”**). In such a situation, the Second Part of s 178 “_deems_” the criminal act to have been committed at _either_ location A or location B. If location A is outside Singapore and the offender is later found in Singapore, then the offender can be considered to have committed the offence in Singapore pursuant to the Second Part of s 178.

#### Second Part of s 178 contains language similar to ambit extension provisions

51     The Defence accepted that the Second Part of s 178 appears to extend the ambit of Singapore criminal law extraterritorially.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

52     Indeed, the formulation and legal effect of the Second Part of s 178 is similar to ambit extension provisions such as s 4 of the Penal Code, s 4 of the Hostage-Taking Act 2010 (“**Hostage-Taking Act**”) and s 34(1) of the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act 2002 (“**TSOFA**”): see **Annex B** at \[3\].

53     In the case of s 4 of the Hostage-Taking Act and s 34(1) of the TSOFA, apart from deeming an extraterritorial act to have been committed in Singapore, these provisions also go on to state that the extraterritorial act “may be proceeded against, charged, tried and punished accordingly”. In my view, the fact that an accused person may be dealt with in a similar manner is also envisaged in both s 178 and s 180. In this regard, the First Part of s 178 explicitly states that the provision is “For the purpose of giving jurisdiction under \[the Merchant Shipping\] Act”. As will be shown in \[55(e)\] below, the First Part can be interpreted as referring to Parliament’s intention for accused persons to be _prosecuted_ pursuant to the Act. This view is reinforced by s 180 which explicitly refers to persons being “_charged_” with having committed extraterritorial offences on ships. Section 180 also expressly provides that courts “shall have _jurisdiction to try_”, and presumably, the _jurisdiction to punish_, such offences.

#### Possible interpretations to the First Part of s 178

54     I now come to the First Part of s 178. It sets out clearly the objective of the provision – which is “For the purpose of _giving jurisdiction_ under \[the Merchant Shipping Act\]”. I will begin by construing the meaning of the _constituent words_ in the First Part. Thereafter, I will analyse the meaning of the First Part _holistically_.

55     Analysing the _constituent words_ in the First Part –

> (a)     The words “For the purpose of …” can mean “With the aim of \[achieving or facilitating a specific outcome\] …”, or simply “To \[achieve or facilitate a specific outcome\]”.

> (b)     The word “giving” can mean “providing” or “conferring”. Reference can be made to s 66 of the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) Act 2014. That provision has the same exact wording as s 178 – save that it uses “conferring” instead of “giving”:

>> **Provision as to jurisdiction in case of offences**

>> 66.    For the purpose of _conferring_ jurisdiction under this Act, every offence is deemed to have been committed, and every cause of complaint to have arisen, either in the place in which the offence actually was committed or arose or in any place in which the offender or person complained against may be.

>> \[italics added\]

> (c)     The word “jurisdiction” can mean “authority” and/or “power”. There are different types of authority/power in the context of criminal law. “Jurisdiction” can refer to the _executive_ authority to enforce criminal laws. It can also refer to the _judicial_ authority to try a person for an offence: Law Reform Paper at page 4. Accordingly, the word “jurisdiction” can have two meanings in the context of s 178.

> (d)     It can mean the authority _of a court_ to try a person for an offence. This interpretation accords with the opening words in s 178 (“For the purpose of giving jurisdiction _under this Act …_”) – by construing the word “jurisdiction” consistently with how the same word has been used in s 180.

> (e)     Alternatively, the word “jurisdiction” can also refer to “_extraterritorial_ jurisdiction” – i.e., the authority or ability to enforce Singapore criminal law outside Singapore. This interpretation can be supported on the following basis.

>> (i)       Parliament has referred to provisions such as s 4 of the Hostage-Taking Act and s 34 of the TSOFA as “providing for extraterritorial _jurisdiction_” – i.e., provisions which give the authorities the jurisdiction to enforce criminal law extraterritorially: see e.g., second reading speech for the Hostage-Taking Bill: Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (16 August 2010) vol 87 at col 395; second reading speech for the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Bill: Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (8 July 2002) vol 75 at col 81.

>> (ii)       Singapore courts have also used the term “extraterritorial jurisdiction” to refer to the extension of Singapore criminal law to extraterritorial criminal acts: see e.g., _Tan Seet Eng v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 453</span> at \[44\]; _Taw Cheng Kong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 78</span> at \[72\] and \[83\]; _Wong Yuh Lan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 845</span> at \[13\] and \[24\]; _Swissbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Ltd v Kingdom of Lesotho_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 263</span> at \[102\].

>> (iii)       Interpreting “jurisdiction” to mean “extraterritorial jurisdiction” accords with the Second Part of s 178 which clearly deals with extraterritoriality: see \[50\] – \[53\] above.

>> (iv)       It bears emphasis that the Second Part of s 178 deems an “_offence_” – not just “an act or omission” as in the case of s 4 of the Hostage-Taking Act and s 34(1) of TSOFA – to have been committed in Singapore.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) This is an example of the extraterritorial application of an enactment _by implication_ alluded to in _Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on Statutory Interpretation_ (LexisNexis, 8th edn.) (“**_Statutory Interpretation_**”) at page 208:

>>> _The presumption \[that an enactment is taken not to apply to people and matters outside the territory to which it extends\] may be displaced impliedly_. As Lord Brougham said in _Jeffreys v Boosey_:

>>>> Nothing is more clear than that \[the legislature\] may … extend its provisions to foreigners in certain cases and may, without express words, make it appear that such was the intendment of those provisions …

>>> In earlier times, travel was difficult and communications poor. Parliament had small occasion to concern itself with the regulation of acts and omissions in foreign parts, even those of British subjects. _Under modern conditions, the legislature is more likely to intend its enactments to apply beyond the territory_.

>>> Where an Act is silent as to its territorial application, whether (and if so to what extent) the presumption is displaced is an issue to be considered by interpreting the Act in the usual way. _Important factors to be considered in this regard are, or course, the mischief that the Act was intended to remedy, and the purpose of the Act. Public interest considerations may well also be relevant._

>>> In _Cox v Ergo Versicherung AG_ Lord Sumption categorised the caselaw in the following way:

>>>> Implied extraterritorial effect is certainly possible, and there are a number of examples of it. But, in most if not all cases, it will arise only if (i) the terms of the legislation cannot effectually be applied or its purpose cannot effectually be achieved unless it has extraterritorial effect; or (ii) the legislation gives effect to policy so significant in the law of the forum that Parliament must have assumed to have intended that policy to apply to any one resorting to an English court regardless of the law that would otherwise apply.

>>> However, these obiter comments (made in the context of a case involving questions of private international law) should not be read as requiring all cases of implied extraterritorial effect to meet one or both of the conditions in the quote set out above. As was noted in _Master Roberts v The Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association_, in _Cox_ Lord Sumption quoted with approval the more general test laid down by Lord Scarman in _Clark v Oceanic Contractors Inc_ (providing for extraterritorial application where this was expressly enacted or _“so plainly implied that the courts must give effect to it”_).

>>> \[italics added; footnoting deleted\]

> (v)     Indeed, in the second edition of _Statutory Interpretation_ at page 275, the author specifically cited s 684 of the U.K. Act – which is _in pari materia_ to s 178 – as an example of extraterritorial application of an enactment _by implication_:

>> By implication, \[provisions such as s 684\] _must be taken to apply the municipal law to persons on board the ship_. This is because references to concepts of the law, such as _offences_, would have no meaning. An act or omission is an “_offence_” only in the context of some applicable system of law, since the concept of an offence, as employed in legislation, is a purely legal one. …

>> \[emphasis and text in square brackets added; footnoting deleted\]

56     Analysing the First Part _holistically_, the phrase “For the purpose of giving jurisdiction under this Act …” can thus have the following two interpretations:

> (a)      **First Interpretation**: “With the aim of conferring authority on the courts to try persons under the Merchant Shipping Act …”. Under this interpretation, s 178 would be a venue provision.

> (b)      **Second Interpretation**: “For the purpose of providing extraterritorial jurisdiction (i.e., extending Singapore criminal laws extraterritorially) under the Merchant Shipping Act …”. Under this interpretation, s 178 would be an ambit extension provision.

#### The Second Interpretation will better promote the purpose of the Act

57     In my judgement, the Second Interpretation should be applied to the First Part of s 178 as it will better promote the purpose of the Merchant Shipping Act – _first_, by allowing for s 178 and s 180 to operate harmoniously, _second_, by giving practical effect to s 180, and _finally_, by providing the legal basis to hold persons on _Singapore_ ships who commit criminal acts extraterritorially liable under Singapore criminal law. These views are elaborated below:

58     Regarding Issue A, the Defence submitted that it would not be a concern if – (a) _s 178_ is interpreted as a venue provision applicable only to extraterritorial offences that are _not_ committed on ships, (b) while _s 180_ is interpreted as a venue provision applicable only to extraterritorial offences that are committed _on ships_. I am not persuaded by the Defence’s submission which draws an artificial distinction between s 178 and s 180. Such a distinction is not supported by (i) a plain reading of these two provisions, (ii) fundamental principles of statutory interpretation or (iii) any case authority.

59     As for Issue D, the Defence submitted that there is no need to establish a legal basis under the Merchant Shipping Act for Singapore to be able to apply its criminal law to Singapore ships on the high seas, as such a basis can be found in the common law.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) I have no hesitation in rejecting this submission which is clearly misconceived. First, Singapore criminal law is _based on statute_ (not the common law), with the primary source of criminal law being the Penal Code: _Public Prosecutor v Ong Jun Yong_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGMC 37</span> at \[22\]. Second, the ambit extension provision that allows Singapore to exercise criminal jurisdiction on Singapore ships ought to be located in the Merchant Shipping Act – as this is the Act that regulates merchant shipping, including the _registration_ of Singapore ships.

#### The Second Interpretation will better advance the public and national interests

60     As is evident from \[57\] above, the First Interpretation will leave a serious lacuna in our law.

61     In contrast, the Second Interpretation will better protect the public and national interests – by ensuring that the authorities and the courts have the ability to prosecute, try and convict persons who commit offences on ships extraterritorially. This ability is important considering that Singapore is (a) a leading international maritime centre, (b) a coastal state of the Straits of Malacca (one of the most important waterways in the world), and (c) one of the top 10 ship registries in the world.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) Furthermore, Singapore has a growing cruise industry. According to an article by the Singapore Tourism Board[^21] –

> Cruising is a key tourism driver for Singapore. … Singapore’s strategic location, world class connectivity and port infrastructure make it a thriving cruise hub in Southeast Asia. Prior to COVID-19, Singapore’s cruise industry enjoyed robust growth. Over 400 cruise ships across 30 cruise brands called at our ports in 2019, with year-on-year growth in passenger throughput of more than 1.8 million that year. … Since Singapore restarted cruising in November 2020, over half a million passengers have sailed on nearly 370 “cruise to nowhere” sailings.

### Second Interpretation consistent with domestic and international law

62     According to the Defence, a ruling that s 178 is an ambit extension provision would be “unacceptably broad”[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) and would be “patently inconsistent with case law and policy”.[^23] The Defence gave three reasons for such a view.

#### Casinos on cruise ships and the Common Gaming Houses Act

63     The Defence’s first reason is that if s 178 is an ambit extension provision, then it can extend the Common Gaming Houses Act 1961 (Repealed) (“**Common Gaming Houses Act**”) to gaming on cruises in international waters, making such activities illegal. Such an outcome would be contrary to the views expressed (a) in Parliament during parliamentary debates in 2005[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) and (b) by the High Court (_Loh Chee Song v Liew Yong Chian_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGHC 1</span> at \[11\]; _Lines International Holding (S) Pte Ltd v Singapore Tourist Promotion Board and another_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 6</span> at \[87\] – \[89\])[^25] that gaming on cruises in international waters is not illegal.

64     In my view, this submission is misconceived. It bears noting that the present case is confined only to the issue of whether s 178 has the effect of extending s 378, s 380, s 441, s 442 and s 451 of the Penal Code to acts allegedly committed by the Accused on a foreign ship on the high seas. Answering the issue in the affirmative (_in the context of the Relevant Penal Code Provisions_) does not mean that s 178 will have a similar effect on the Common Gaming Houses Act.

65     Whether the Common Gaming Houses Act can be extended extraterritorially pursuant to s 178 will depend on, among others, the mischief sought to be addressed by the Act and whether the elements of the relevant offences under that Act have been satisfied. In this regard, I share the same doubts expressed in Parliament and by the High Court as to whether gaming on cruise ships on the high seas can constitute offences under the Common Gaming Houses Act. Let me explain.

> (a)     The Common Gaming Houses Act is concerned with “the suppression of common gaming houses, public gaming and public lotteries” _in Singapore_: see the long title to the Act. In the absence of submissions otherwise, I am not sure that the Common Gaming Houses Act is intended to suppress such activities – which is a matter of _municipal_ concern – where they occur _outside_ Singapore. Put in another way, it is not evident that the suppression of gaming on cruise ships in the high seas is within the mischief targeted by the Act.

> (b)     Additionally, it bears noting that a common ingredient in the offences under the Common Gaming Houses Act is that the gaming has to have a “_public_” character.

>> (i)       The Act criminalises acts relating to a “common gaming house”: s 4, s 6, s 7 and s 9. The term “common gaming house” has been defined in s 2(1) of the Act to include “any place kept or used for gaming to which _the public or any class of the public_ has or may have access, and any place kept for _habitual gaming_, whether the public or any class of the public has or may have access thereto or not, and any place kept or used for the purpose of a _public lottery_ whether the public has access thereto or not”.

>> (ii)       “Public lottery” is also criminalised under the Act: s 5, s 6 and s 9. Under s 2(1) of the Act, the term “public lottery” has been defined to mean “a lottery to which _the public or any class of the public_ has or may have access, and every lottery shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to be a public lottery”.

>> (iii)       The Act criminalises gaming in a public place: s 8 of the Act. The term “public place” has been defined in the Act to mean any place to which the _public has or may have access_ and includes any estate, factory or place in which 10 or more persons are employed”.

> (c)     The word “public” can be understood to mean ordinary people in the society in general:[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)_Public Prosecutor v Yap Ah Hoon_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 1 SLR(R) 506</span> at \[9\] – \[13\]; _Chua Seong Soi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 271</span> at \[6\], \[11\] – \[13\]. It is not evident to me that a casino on a cruise ship in the middle of the South China Sea can be said to be a place that is accessible to ordinary people in Singapore.

#### Singapore citizens caught in situations where different criminal laws apply

66     The Defence’s second reason against a ruling that s 178 is an ambit extension provision is that this could lead to tricky situations where Singapore citizens find themselves exposed to criminal liability under Singapore criminal law but not under the criminal law of other relevant States. To illustrate this point, the Defence gave the example of a male Singapore citizen who has consensual sex with a 15-year-old female German citizen on a German ship on the high seas. The age of consent under Singapore law is 16 years old, whereas it is 14 years old under German law. In this hypothetical case, the Defence highlighted that the Singapore citizen would have committed an offence under Singapore law but under not German law.

67     I am not impressed by this argument.

> (a)     First, I do not see why the situation raised by the Defence should (i) justify denying s 178 an interpretation that accords with its plain meaning, and thus (ii) prevent the Singapore authorities from dealing with extraterritorial offences in appropriate cases.

> (b)     Second, s 178 is not novel provision. It can trace its roots to s 684 of the U.K. Act, which has been in the statute books throughout the British Empire since 1894. There are at least two English cases (_Kelly_ and _Cumberworth_) and one New Zealand case (_The King v Hinde_ (1902) GLR(V) 139 involving a forgery case) where offenders have been convicted for extraterritorial offences committed on foreign ships. The Defence has not adduced any literature to show that s 684 has been criticised for being “unacceptably broad”.

> (c)     On the contrary, the relevant literature reveals that there is a call for States to enact relevant laws to respond more effectively to offences committed on foreign ships on the high seas. See e.g., Kate Lewins and Nick Gaskell, _Jurisdiction over Criminal Acts on Cruise Ships_, (2013) Criminal Law Journal 37 (4) 221; Timothy Smith, _Fighting on the Blue Ocean: New Zealand’s Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction and Maritime Protest_ (2001) 32 VUWLR 499.

> (d)     Finally, in the Defence’s hypothetical, the Prosecution will need to decide whether it is in the public interest to prosecute the Singapore citizen. In coming to this decision, (i) the fact that the act is not criminal under German law, (ii) whether Singapore has the basis to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction under international law, (iii) whether there is exploitation of the German citizen, and (iv) whether the Singapore citizen is a paedophile and thus poses a danger to children will presumably be some of the factors considered by the Prosecution.

#### Criminal acts by foreign persons on foreign ships

68     The Defence’s third reason against a ruling that s 178 is an ambit extension provision is that foreign passengers on foreign ships could be held liable for offences under Singapore criminal law. Such a scenario, according to the Defence, “would have drastic repercussions on international law”.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

69     In my view, such concerns are misplaced.

> (a)     In the context of civil aviation, there is already domestic legislation that is similar to s 178. Section 3(2) of the Tokyo Convention Act 1971 (“**Tokyo Convention Act**”) provides that –

>> **Application of criminal law to certain act or omission on aircraft**

>> 3.—(1)  …

>> (2)    If —

>>> (a)    any act or omission taking place on board _any aircraft_ (_not being a Singapore-controlled aircraft_) while _in flight elsewhere than in or over Singapore_ which, if taking place in Singapore, would constitute an offence under the law in force in Singapore; and

>>> (b)    the aircraft subsequently lands in Singapore with the person who committed the act or omission still on board the aircraft,

>> the act or omission constitutes that offence.

>> \[italics added\]

> (b)     Just like s 178, s 3(2) of the Tokyo Convention Act allows a _foreign_ passenger on a _foreign_ aircraft to be held liable for offences committed on the aircraft _outside_ Singapore when that aircraft subsequently lands in Singapore.

> (c)     The Tokyo Convention Act was enacted pursuant to Singapore’s ratification of the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft (“**the Convention**”). The Convention is the result of international consensus that States need to take firm and quick action to protect the safety of an aircraft and of the persons and property thereon and to maintain good order and discipline on board the aircraft. Similar considerations apply in the context of cruise ships.

> (d)     Finally, regarding the Defence’s concerns about there will be a potential over-reach of Singapore criminal law to foreign passengers on foreign ships in international waters, this would presumably be considered by the Prosecution in deciding whether to initiate prosecution pursuant to s 178. In the present case, I note that (i) the alleged victim is a Singapore permanent resident, (ii) the alleged offender is a Singapore citizen, (iii) the alleged offences were committed outside the territorial waters of other States, (iv) the ship had operated from Singapore at the material time, and (v) Singapore was the next port after the offences had allegedly been committed. International law recognises that States can exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction in these circumstances – whether based on the nationality of the offender (active personality jurisdiction), the nationality of the victim (passive personality jurisdiction), or the fact that it is the next port of call (port state jurisdiction).

## Conclusion

70     When a crime has been committed on a cruise ship operating from Singapore involving Singapore citizens and residents, our criminal law must have the ability to bring the perpetrator to justice. This is especially so where the Flag State does not have the law, or the interest, to prosecute an offence committed on its ship far away from its territory, and where the offender, victim and witnesses are not its citizens or residents.

71     The Accused’s position that a person cannot be held criminally liable and cannot be tried for offences under the Relevant Penal Code Provision (a) is inconsistent with the plain wordings of s 178 and s 180, (b) creates a dangerous and unnecessary lacuna in our criminal law, and (c) undermines our public and national interests.

72     In my view –

> (a)     Section 178 is an ambit extension provision – i.e., it has the effect of extending the Relevant Penal Code Provisions to criminal acts committed by Singapore citizens against Singapore permanent residents on foreign ships outside Singapore.

> (b)     Section 180 is a venue provision – i.e., it confers jurisdiction on courts to try offences under the Relevant Penal Code Provisions if the conditions set out in the provision are satisfied.

> (c)     The House-breaking Charge and Theft Charge currently state s 180 as the applicable ambit extension provision. They ought to state _s 178_ instead.

> (d)     The Accused can in law be tried and convicted on the House-breaking Charge and Theft Charge _if the elements of these charges were made out_. Whether the Accused is in fact guilty of these charges remains to be determined. This is because I have yet to hear the Prosecution’s evidence and the Accused’s defence.

73     Following my determination on the Preliminary Legal Issue, the matter was adjourned for the parties to consider their next course of action.
