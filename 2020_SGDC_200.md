Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Cheating

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9687/2020/01.\]

31 August 2020

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the accused, a 43-year-old female.

2       The accused pleaded guilty to three cheating charges under s 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”). Nine more charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC charges”). These included three similar cheating charges and six attempted cheating charges.

## The Charges

3       The accused, a director of ROI Strategy Consultants Pte Ltd (“ROI”), was charged with cheating SPRING Singapore (“SPRING”) by deceiving SPRING on 1 November 2012, 12 December 2012 and 2 March 2013 (DAC-917178-2017, DAC-917181-2017 & DAC 917184-2017 respectively), that the project which the company had performed for three companies under the Innovation and Capability Voucher (“ICV”) Scheme was completed with the involvement of one Shweta Agrawal, which she knew was not true, and thereby dishonestly inducing SPRING to deliver a sum of $5,000 on each of the three occasions to ROI, which SPRING would not have done if it were not so deceived.

## The Statement of Facts

4       The accused admitted to Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. A summary of the facts is set out below.

5       The ICV Scheme is a government grant scheme for small and medium sized enterprises (“SMEs”) run by SPRING. Under the ICV Scheme, SMEs can apply for Capability Vouchers (“CVs”) when they engaged service providers (“SPs”) to provide them with SPRING-approved projects (“ICV Projects”).

6       To qualify as an SP, a company must have qualified consultants who are able to carry out the ICV Projects. The ICV Projects were tied to these consultants. When ROI was appointed as a SP, Shweta Agrawal (“Shweta”), then an employee of ROI, was specified as the approved consultant. Subsequently, Shweta Agrawal resigned from ROI. However, SPRING was not notified of the resignation.

7       As an SP, ROI carried out three ICV Projects. Upon the completion of each projects, the voucher redemption form and ICV Report were submitted to SPRING upon the instructions of the accused. The reports identified Shweta as the consultant for these projects and stated that she had carried out 40 hours of work for each project. The accused knew that this is false as Shweta was not involved in any of these projects. Moreover, the work was performed by various employees of ROI without any involvement from Shweta. These employees were not qualified consultants which SPRING had selected for the purpose of the ICV Scheme.

8       Therefore, SPRING was deceived into believing that the three ICV Projects were completed with the involvement of an approved consultant, namely Shweta. SPRING accordingly approved the redemption of the CVs and disbursed $5,000 to ROI for each project. Had SPRING known that these projects were completed without Shweta’s involvement, it would not have approved the redemption and disbursed the funds.

9       In total, SPRING approved six projects and disbursed a total of $30,000 to ROI. Another six applications were rejected by SPRING as it was discovered that ROI had breached the terms and conditions in its letter of appointment by SPRING, amongst others, these included representing that Shweta was involved in the ICV Projects.

10     Full restitution was made by the accused on 13 November 2019.

## Antecedents

11     The accused has no antecedents.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

12     The prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence was a _global_ sentence of ten weeks’ imprisonment or five weeks’ imprisonment for each of the three charges. To support their submission, the prosecution tendered a Skeletal Submission of Sentence dated 3 January 2020 (“Address on Sentence by Prosecution”), Reply to Defence’s Mitigation Plea and Submission on Sentence dated 11 February 2020 (“Reply to Defence”) and Prosecution’s Further Address on Sentence dated 4 March 2020.

13     First, the prosecution submitted that the custody threshold had been crossed. This was a case that involved deceiving government departments into disbursing public monies. Deterrence was therefore the dominant sentencing consideration in such cases. It did not matter if the department concerned did not suffer any financial loss. Public policy considerations dictated that the deterrent sentence in the form of a custodial sentence was warranted.

14     In determining the sentencing range, the prosecution relied on _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir vs Public Prosecutor & Anor Appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“_Idya_”). In _Idya_ at \[47\], the High Court held that, for offences under s 417 PC, custodial sentences are _“ ….. generally appropriate as long as the offence in question causes a victim to part with property that has more than a negligible value ….”_ and went on to observe that _“ ….. custodial sentences for terms of between four to eight months imprisonment have been imposed for cheating offences that resulted in losses of between $1,000 and $15,000 ….”._

15     Therefore, applying these sentencing principles in _Idya_ to the present case, the prosecution submitted that for the amounts involved in the proceeded charges, namely $15,000, the sentencing range was between four to eight months’ imprisonment.

16     The prosecution submitted that, other than the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty and that full restitution had been made, there were no other mitigating factors that would warrant a further discount in sentencing. It was therefore submitted that 10 weeks’ imprisonment would be the appropriate sentence for the present case.

### Mitigation plea

17     The defence submitted for a non-custodial sentence and tendered a Mitigation Plea and a Defence Submission on Sentence both dated 17 January 2020 (“Mitigation Plea” and “Defence Submission on Sentence”, respectively ) and Defence Reply to Further Submission on Sentence dated 20 March 2020 (“Defence’s Further Submission on Sentence”).

18     In seeking a non-custodial sentence, the defence sought to portrayed this as a unique case. A summary of the factors cited by the defence for a non-custodial sentence is set out below.

19     First was the culpability of the accused in the present case. Here, all the project(s) undertaken by ROI were completed, although, admittedly, Shweta herself did not do the work. The company had been given either a “good” or “excellent” rating by the participating SMEs and there was no issue with SPRING for the substance of work done with the objectives being met.

20     It was also submitted that no ancillary harm was caused, either to SPRING or the SMEs concerned. All the projects undertaken by ROI were completed, therefore, the SMEs themselves had benefitted from them. On the other hand, SPRING itself did not suffer any financial loss as restitution had been made. In fact, the accused was out of pocket to the sum of $10,046 because she had to pay for the services for the various staff and participants involved in the ICV Projects and those ICV Projects that were completed but not approved for payment.

21     There was no sinister planning or any attempt to hide or seriously avoid detection. The defence highlighted that in one of the ICV Reports, it was openly stated that for the focus group studies conducted, two other staff were involved and exclusively conducted the focus group studies. Therefore, SPRING would have known, upon reading the report, that Shweta was not involved.

22     The accused’s contributions to the community were highlighted to the court. She has achieved many awards and accolades and has put her knowledge into good use for many SMEs to bring their businesses to the next level. Her motivation was not the $5,000 that SPRING would be paying for the project conducted for each SME but the benefit that the SME would obtain by the implementation of the scheme through ROI.

## Sentencing Considerations

### The punishment prescribed by law

23     The punishment prescribed by law for an offence under s 417 of the PC is a term of imprisonment of up to three years or with a fine or with both.

### The custody threshold

24     In _Lim Mong Hong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 88</span>, the government entity that was cheated was the National Science and Technology Board (“NSTB”). In dismissing the appeal against a 16-month imprisonment term, the High Court was of the view at \[48\] that:

> “…….. I first noted that NSTB is a public institution administering public funds. The courts generally adopt a harsh approach in cheating cases when the victim is a Government department or agency. This is done not out of cronyism but rather to safeguard our national resources ……”

25     In _Dong Guitain v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 34</span>, the accused was convicted of cheating the Ministry of Manpower (‘MOM”). He had deceived MOM into issuing Prior Approvals for the recruitment of 140 workers. On appeal, the High Court noted at \[40\] that the principle of deterrence ought to be a dominant consideration where the deception had been perpetrated against a government department. Therefore, in such cases, public policy dictated that a harsher sentence was justified, and it did not matter that the government department did not suffer any financial loss. In _Dong Guitian_, although MOM had not suffered any immediate and tangible financial loss, the appellant’s act of deception had frustrated the intention of the Singapore Government to effectively regulate and monitor the recruitment of foreign labour in Singapore.

26     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that in such cases, deterrence should be the dominant sentencing consideration. Therefore, where government departments are deceived into delivering public monies, the starting point is a custodial term, even if, at the end of the day, restitution was made, and the government department concerned suffered no actual financial loss.

### The indicative starting sentencing range

27     I next sought to identify the indicative starting sentencing ranges for these offences. In this respect, I noted that offences under s 417 PC offences cover a wide variety of offence types and many cases that are dealt with by the courts involve credit card cheating offences. Instances of cases involving the cheating of government entities are much fewer in comparison

28     As cheating offences involve a monetary value, the indicative starting sentencing range should, at first instant, be based on this value. In determining this range, I reviewed sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution. The following is a summary of the cases:

29     From these precedents, I arrived at the following _indicative starting sentencing range_ (as opposed to the _appropriate sentence_ as suggested by the Prosecution) for the present case.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.48%"> <col width="49.52%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Monetary Value</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Up to $20,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 8 weeks imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$20,000 - $40,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8-16 weeks imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$40,000 - $60,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">16-24 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

30     As such, I was of the view that the indicative starting sentence in the present case would be an _individual sentence_ of two to three weeks’ imprisonment per charge or a _global_ sentence of about six weeks’ imprisonment. It should be noted that I had based the indicative starting global sentence on the monetary value in the _proceeded_ charges.

### Aggravating factors

31     I next considered the aggravating factors that would warrant an uplift in the indicative starting sentence. Here, I noted that there were a total of nine TIC charges. The three s 417 PC TIC charges involved a further $15,000 while the other six TIC charges were for attempted cheating. In light of the number of charges and the amounts therein, I adjudged that there should be an uplift in the _global sentence_ of at least three to four weeks’ imprisonment.

### Mitigating Factors

32     I will proceed to address the main submissions in the plea in mitigation to persuade the court to impose a non-custodial sentence.

33     Unlike the facts in the cases cited, in this case, for each of the ICV Projects undertaken by ROI, the work was carried out and it had been rated “good” or “excellent” by the participating SMEs. However, I agreed with the prosecution that the intent of having qualified consultants was to ensure SMEs were provided with the relevant expertise and support was frustrated by the accused’s actions. In addition, it ignored the gravamen of the charge, namely that SPRING was deceived into accepting the reports and disbursing grants.

34     Like the prosecution, I did not share the defence’s characterization of the accused’s primary motivation, namely the benefit that the SMEs would obtain through the scheme. As pointed out by the prosecution, the defence own figures at \[115\] of the Plea in Mitigation showed that the cost for each ICV Project was $2,000 whilst the accused could claim $5,000 from SPRING to which the entire sum was claimed. In my view, the $3,000 or so profit that could be obtained for each ICV Project provided a clear motivation for ROI to proceed with these projects even thought Shweta was no longer employed by ROI.

35     With regard to the other mitigating factors raised by the defence, for example, her health, that there was no concealment of the crime etc, I am also in agreement with the prosecution that these factors are neutral or, at best, showed a lack of an aggravating factor.

36     As I had mentioned earlier at \[26\], where government departments are deceived into delivering public monies, the starting point is a custodial term even if full restitution is made. However, I do acknowledge that in exceptional cases, there may be mitigating factors may warrant a non-custodial term in the final analysis. This case is unfortunately not one of them. I found no exceptional factors warranting a non-custodial sentence.

37     Notwithstanding this, I was of the view that the accused’s actions in this case in actually performing the work for the projects undertaken resulted in the lowering of her culpability _viz-a-viz_ the precedent case(s) cited, hence, I adjudged that a slight downward reduction in the global sentence to 8 weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

## Conclusion

38     Accordingly, for the reasons that I have highlighted above, I imposed the following sentences on the accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="28.28%"> <col width="36.36%"> <col width="35.36%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge Number</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 917178/19</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 417 PC</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 919181/19</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 417 PC</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 917184/19</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 417 PC</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

39     Pursuant to s 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), I am required to order two of the sentences of imprisonment consecutively. I therefore ordered that the sentences of imprisonment in DAC 917178/19 and DAC 917184/19 to run consecutively. The total sentence imposed was therefore 8 weeks’ imprisonment.

40     The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, now appeals against it. She is presently on bail pending the outcome of the appeal.
