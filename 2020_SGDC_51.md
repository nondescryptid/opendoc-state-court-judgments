\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9032/2020/01 .\]

23 March 2020

### District Judge Marvin Bay:

### Introduction

This is an appeal against sentence by the accused Kuan Ah Ming, a permanent resident aged 57, who faced two charges in respect of his harassment activities, with another person, at the behest of unlicensed moneylenders (commonly referred to by the acronym UML) contrary to section 28(1)(_b_) of the Moneylenders Act (MLA) and an offence under section 28(2)(_a_) of the MLA read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) a(“Penal Code”), which is punishable under section 28(2)(_a_) read with section 28(3)(a) of the Act. I sentenced Mr Guan to sentences of **_six months_**’ imprisonment on each charge, with sentences to run consecutively, yielding a **_global_** term of **_12 months’_** imprisonment. Mr Kuan’s co-accused for the UML charges; Mr Loh Swee Keng received terms of **_nine months’_** imprisonment for each of the mirror charges. The co-accused nine-month sentence for one of these mirror charges was ordered to run consecutively with one-month sentence for a theft charge (which did not involve the accused), with the other UML charge ordered to run concurrently, and thus aggregating to a global term of **_10 months’_** imprisonment.

2       I am given to understand that Mr Kuan’s appeal is predicated in his dissatisfaction with the fact of his sentence being two months longer than that of his confederate, and also of his receiving consecutive sentences, where only two UML charges were proceeded with. These grounds will delve into the salient sentencing considerations which are in play for this genre of UML harassment offences, as well as my basis for considering Mr Kuan’s offending to be comparatively more egregious than that of his associate, whom he had recruited into this criminal activity. I will also state the basis for Mr Kuan’s receipt of consecutive sentences, and that these would be just and proportionate, where appropriate adjustments have been made to ensure a commensurable level of parity (after factoring in the ‘_relevant differences’_ in their respective manners of offending).

### Charges

3       Mr Kuan faced two charges including the one (DAC-906188-2019) set out below**:**

> **(Mr Kuan is)** charged that (he), on the 15th day January 2019, at about 12.30 am, at Blk 808 Yishun Ring Road #XXX, Singapore, together with one Loh Swee Keng, in furtherance of (their) common intention[^1] and acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender known only as “Joseph”, did commit an act likely to cause annoyance to one Ahamed Saifudeen Abdul Shukkur, to wit, by locking the metal gate with a blue bicycle lock and pasting a yellow note with writing _“ZAID BIN MADON_ (particulars and address) _CALL YOSEPH_ (number)” on the gate, in connection with a loan to one Zaid Bin Madon, when “Joseph” was not an excluded moneylender, an exempt moneylender or authorised to do so by licence…

4       The event which premised the other proceeded charge; DAC-909525-2019, had also occurred on 15 January 2019, at 1.10 am , at an apartment in the sixth floor of Blk 123 in Simei, where Mr Kuan, with the same confederate Loh Swee Keng, had conducted harassment activities against a certain Khoo Gek Chiang who had borrowed monies an unlicensed moneylender, by locking the metal gate with a bicycle lock. Mr Kuan had done this at the behest of the person known to him as ’_Joseph_’.

### The offence

5       The Moneylenders Act makes it an offence for an unlicensed moneylender to by himself or a proxy, cause ‘_alarm and annoyance’_ to individuals in circumstances connected to the extension of a loan[^2]. The proxies or agents of such harassment activities _‘acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender’_ commit an offence carrying a maximum term of five years’ imprisonment, along with liability to a maximum fine of $50 000 and caning[^3].

### Relevant details from the Statement of Facts

6       The following is a _precis_ of relevant facts from the Statement of Facts[^4] which Mr Kuan admitted to without any qualification. The facts which were most pertinent to sentencing would be the background history with his principal _‘Joseph’_, his engagement of co-accused Loh Swee Keng in perpetrating his acts of harassment as well as the _modus operandi_ developed and their specific roles in prosecuting the acts. These aspects are especially given my understanding that Mr Kuan’s dissatisfaction with his sentence has primary arisen from his perception of a disparity existing between his sentence and the one meted to his accomplice. The highlighted facts will allow a better juxtaposition with similar cases where co-accused persons were differentially sentenced, and allow a more _nuanced_ discussion on when and how the principles of sentencing parity allow for differential sentencing, and the extent of that difference.

### Entering into the arrangement to harass on ‘Joseph’s’ behalf

7       The Statement of Facts indicates Mr Kuan and Mr Loh Swee Keng, a Singaporean aged 49, to have been acquaintances. Their relation had dated from 2017 after an introduction by a mutual friend. Mr Kuan admitted having in December 2018, enticed Mr Loh with the prospect of earning ‘_additional income’_ by joining him to assist an unlicensed moneylender known to Mr Kuan as _‘Joseph’_. Mr Loh had been enlisted with Mr Kuan promising to share half of what _‘Joseph’_ paid him (Mr Kuan) with Mr Loh. Mr Kuan admitted to being paid $200-$300 by ‘Joseph’ for each act of harassment, and he would duly pay Mr Loh $150 for his assistance.

### Development of a standard operating procedure for executing harassment activities

8       Mr Kuan admitted to the duo developing a standard _modus operandi_ for each harassment job performed for ‘_Joseph’_. The process began with Mr Kuan receiving a debtor’s address from _‘Joseph’ via WhatsApp_ messaging, which Mr Kuan would forward to Mr Loh.

9       In the actual execution of the acts of harassment, Mr Loh would drive to Mr Kuan’s location, pick him up and drive him to the debtor’s residence to commit the UML offences.

### Facts relating to the DAC-906188-2019

10     The victim in this charge was one Ahamed Saifudeen Abdul Shukkur, a 36-year old the second floor unit at Block 808 Yishun Ring Road. Mr Saifudeen himself had not borrowed from any unlicensed moneylenders, but his landlord: Mr Zaid bin Madon had fallen into the thrall of unlicensed moneylenders.

11     On 15 January 2019 at 7.31am, Mr Zaid had been notified by his tenant about the harassment activity in his apartment, and had lodged a police report of the predicament faced by the tenant. Mr Zaid stated _“I rent out my house, I reported police about loanshark, I left my house almost 2 years, today my tenant called me said the gate was chain pad lock and can’t go for work.”_

### Admitted harassment activities uncovered by investigations

12     Mr Kuan has conceded to the following having taken place. On 15 January 2019 at about 12.30 am, the two men had acted under instructions of ‘_Joseph_’ to proceed to Mr Zaid’s apartment, where Mr Loh had used a blue bicycle lock to lock the main gate of the unit. Mr Kuan’s own role was to paste a yellow note on where he had penned ‘_ZAID BIN MADON_, (particulars and address) _CALL YOSEPH_(number)_’_. Mr Loh had thereafter used his mobile phone to take images of the locked unit and note. Mr Loh had then forwarded the images photographs to Mr Kuan, **_who in turn sent the images_** to ‘Joseph’, the commissioning unlicensed moneylender. Mr Kuan has admitted to the harassment having been committed in furtherance of a common intention between himself and Mr Loh, to undertake this act at ‘_Joseph’s’_ behest.

13     The situation required police intervention to visit the Yishun unit, where the bicycle chain and padlock securing the main gate of the department were cut and seized, along with the debtor’s note.

### Facts relating to DAC-909525-2019

14     The second victim was a certain Khoo Gek Chiang, aged 47, who had resided at the sixth floor of Block 123 Simei Street 1, who had owed sums to an unlicensed moneylender. On 15 January 2019 at about 9.20am, Mr Khoo had found himself imprisoned in his own Simei apartment home, and had lodged a police report stating ‘_I just realised my gate is locked by padlock now. I saw the person running away. I am a borrower._”

15     The surrounding facts gleaned from police investigation showed that Mr Kuan had later on 15 January 2019, at 1.10am, proceeded, again under the instructions of ‘Joseph’ with Mr Loh to undertake a fresh set of harassment activities at Mr Khoo’s Simei unit. and Loh proceeded to the Simei unit. At the unit, both men reprised their routine with Mr Loh using a blue bicycle lock to lock the main gate, and proceeding to use his mobile phone to take an image of the locked unit, and sending the image to Mr Kuan for his onward transmission to ‘_Joseph_’, Mr Kuan’s anonymous principal. Here too, Mr Kuan affirmed that the harassment activities had been committed in furtherance of the common intention of both to visit acts likely to cause annoyance to Mr Khoo, in connection with the loan he owed an illegal moneylender.

### Facts relating to TIC charges

16     Mr Kuan consented to the taking into consideration of three other charges. These related to the following:

> (i)      **DAC-905538-2019**, where Mr Kuan has acted **_alone_** for an unlicensed moneylender ‘_KT_’ to past a debtor’s note at the gate of a debtor at an address in Whampoa Drive on 31 Jan 2019 at 4.40 pm.

> (ii)      **DAC-911974-2019**, where the accused has acted **_in concert_** with Mr Loh Swee Keng for unlicensed moneylender ‘_Joseph_’ to past a debtor’s note, and lock the gate of a debtor at an address in Beach Road on 17 Jan 2019 at 1.35 am; and

> (iii)      **DAC-911875-2019**, where Mr Kuan has acted **_alone_** for an unlicensed moneylender ‘_Joseph_’ to past a debtor’s note at the gate of a debtor at an address in Jurong West Street 81, on 30 Jan 2019 at 4.40 pm.

### Sentencing address by prosecution

17     To justify their call for a global term of **_14 months’_** imprisonment, the learned DPP furnished a fairly detailed address, which covered four distinct areas. The first being a general survey of cases of the genre, the second part covering the sentence the co-accused received. This _segued_ into a third part where the sentence of the co-accused; Loh Swee Keng (imposed in another district court) was analysed to allow an appropriate extrapolation to the sentence Mr Kuan should receive for each proceeded charge, considering what they regarded as his **_senior_** role in the criminal enterprise, as against Mr Loh. The fourth part pertained to the DPPs argument that Mr Kuan should be consecutively sentenced, along with a proposal to balance the final sentence to ensure a degree of parity in his sentence and that meted against the co-accused.

### Unrelated precedent cases

18     In assisting the court to develop a ‘baseline’ sentence for cases within the same genre, the prosecution proffered the three following cases. I have added a **_fourth_** case, which involved the **_co-accused_** in the third case, as a juxtaposition of the two co-accused’s cases would disclose sentencing factors which I found highly relevant to the instant case.

19     For ease of discussion, the details supplied by the DPP[^5] have been paraphrased and edited for brevity. I have also added facts from my own perusal of these cases within our records which I found relevant. The cases are first instances cases with no appeals filed. There are of course many other concluded cases of moneylender harassment cases which can be offered as precedents. I have, nevertheless, noted the cases proffered to be a fair **_representative sample_** within the genre of moneylender harassments where victims’ gates were locked and debtor notices left, but where no vandalism or other property damage has occurred. Given this, these four cases would suffice to facilitate a cogent discussion on the sentencing range for this particular genre of debtor harassment. I have verified the accuracy and noted the representative validity of these four cases, I do not therefore propose to reference or describe **_other_** cases of this nature in these grounds, given that this would add undue prolixity to these grounds to simply show that other cases invariably reveal similar and consistent patterns of sentencing.

20     In assessing the cases set out below, I was mindful to avoid an undiscerning reliance to preceding cases, which the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Mumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 23</span> had cautioned against. At \[74\]:

> **_Ultimately, each case must be determined on its own factual matrix. The process of sentencing is a matter of law that involves manifold factors so that no two cases can ever be totally identical for the purposes of sentencing_** _: Wan Kim Hock v PP_ \[2003\] 1 SLR 410. Thus, while past cases (and benchmark sentences) are clearly helpful in providing guidelines for the court, they must be acknowledged as just that and no more. In the final analysis, while consistency in sentencing is a desirable objective, it should never become an overriding or inflexible principle: _Mohd Shahrin bin Shwi v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR 553</span>. \[Emphasis added\]

**_Case of PP v Jeya Selan_** **(SC-907853-2017)**

21     In _PP v Jaya Seelan Myil Ravanan_ (DAC 929290/2017 & Ors), the untraced offender had fallen to hard times as he had to give up his job as a _Grab_ Driver upon his failure to obtain an ‘approval to drive’ certification from LTA. He had then fallen in with illegal moneylenders when he had sought a loan to rent a motorcycle to work as a _Food Panda_ deliveryman. In respect of the proceeded charge, he had on 14 August 2017 at 6.00 p.m., gone to an apartment in Jurong East Street 21, and at the behest of an unlicensed moneylender, locked the unit with a black bicycle cable lock and handed a debtor’s note to the victim. The victim had called the police and used a pair of pliers and a hammer from his own apartment to cut off the bicycle chain. With two other charges being taken into consideration, Mr Jaya Seelan received a term of **_eight months’ imprisonment_** for the single proceeded charge.

**_Case of PP v Muhammad Zuraimy_** **(SC-902770-2017)**

22     In _PP v Muhammad Zuraimy bin Rothly_, (DAC 910776/2017), the offender, who was traced for unrelated antecedents, was a debtor-turned-assistor who acted on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender named ‘Kenny’. On 5 March 2017 at 9pm, he had bought a blue bicycle lock from a hardware shop near his residence in Yishun, and gone to an apartment at Sembawang Close, where he had used the bicycle lock to lock the gate of the victim’s unit. Mr Zuraimy then took an image of his handiwork, which he forwarded to _‘Kenny’._ Mr Zuraimy received a term of **_nine months’_** imprisonment.

**_Case of PP v Belveder Lai_** **(SC-913317-2016)**

23     The case of _PP v Belveder Lai Jun Yang_ (DAC 949237/2016) has important parallels to the instant case. This case also involved a team of two harassers, with **_differential sentencing_** meted against the two offenders in a manner that was congruent with their respective roles, and their level of association with the principal unlicensed moneylender. The offender and an accomplice; a certain _Huang Deyi_ had on 28 December 2016, locked the gate of the flat of a borrower in Compassvale Road on the instructions of an unlicensed moneylender. The men had also left debtors’ notes outside the targeted apartment. The offender, who had consented to the taking into consideration of another harassment charge; DAC-900413-2017, received a term of **_40 weeks’ imprisonment_****[^6]** for the single proceeded charge.

24     Other salient facts gathered from my own perusal of the Statement of Facts showed that _Belveder Lai_ differed from the typical profile of a harasser. Harassers are largely drawn from the ranks of desperate debtors who were recruited upon an agreement to undertake harassment work in consideration of an expiation (or at least a drawdown) of their own extant debts. Mr Lai himself was **_not_** a debtor and was not in personal contact with the unlicensed moneylender who had commissioned the act, one ‘_Jovan_’ He had **_volunteered_** to take on the harassment activity upon learning of Huang’s own need. The Statement of Facts[^7] in that case states:

> 10.    Sometime in December 2016, (_Mr Huang_) informed (_Mr Lai_) that he had borrowed money from an unlicensed moneylender and was unable to service the loans.

>> b.     _(Mr Huang)_ then informed (_Mr Lai_) that he had been offered to_(sic)_ work for ‘_Jovin_’ as a runner to offset his loans.

>> c.     _(Mr Huang_) asked (_Mr Lai_) to provide transport to the locations at which he was to commit acts of harassment on behalf of “_Jovin_”.

25     The Statement of Facts for _Beveder_ reveals[^8] that the eponymous offender’s lack of connection with the unlicensed moneylender extended to Mr Lai giving the co-accused; Huang Deyi, his mobile phone to communicate directly with ‘_Jovin_’ and to take photos of the incident as proof of completion of the act of harassment. In the execution of the proceeded charge (DAC-949237-2016) Mr Lai had driven Mr Huang to a friend’s house in Toa Payoh to print the A4 sized demand notes. Mr Lai had then proceeded to drive to the targeted apartment at Compassvale Road. Mr Lai had donned a cap to conceal his identity, and remained at the staircase landing of the second floor to act as a lookout. Mr Huang had proceeded to lock the main gate of the targeted flat with a red bicycle lock, and also placed four A4 sized demand notes on the floor outside the apartment.

### Case of Belveder Lai’s co-accused: Huang Deyi

26     For completeness, I have also looked into the sentencing records for the co-accused _Huang Deyi_, where the prosecution, in an oral address in a separate district court, had asked for a sentence **_higher_** than the 40 weeks’ imprisonment that _Belveder Lai_ received. The learned DPP there[^9] did not venture her own sense of an appropriate quantum, leaving the sentence to the court. The oral submission documented in the minute sheet show a submission that Mr Huang was deemed ‘more culpable’ as he was the party who had borrowed from the unlicensed moneylender, and crucially taken the step to **_‘rope in’_** co-accused _Belveder Lai_. The district judge there, while referencing the principle of parity in sentencing, noted Mr Huang’s antecedent and mental health history[^10] and imposed a sentence of **_11 months’ imprisonment_** against Mr Huang for the single charge proceeded with.

### Heavier sentences imposed for harassers who recruit others

27     An analysis of the above cases would show a sentence range from **_eight months to 11 months_** for the various s 28(1(b) Moneylenders Act offences. There is, in my view, a clearly rational and discernible basis for this range, as the sentences on the lower end involved factual matrices where the offender had acted alone and been beset by desperate personal and pecuniary circumstances.

28     While there is long standing caselaw that financial hardship, absent exceptional circumstances, would not stand as a **_mitigatory_** factor of itself[^11], there is a basis for situational differentiation for certain classes of moneylending harassers. In _Ong Chee Eng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 115</span>, Chao Hick Tin JA had called for **_nuanced sentencing_** for moneylending harassers[^12]. While recognising the primacy of deterrence for such offences, his honour found a basis to accord a level of amelioration in sentence for borrowers in desperate financial straits that had arisen from legitimate liabilities, and who had in turn become harassers from pure financial need. In _Ong Chee Eng’s_ case the offender’s remorse had been patent in his helping authorities solve offences where they had not even suspected his involvement.

29     Conversely, where an offence is committed from sheer greed, without the **_absence_** of venality in cases precipitated financial pressure, the sentences would occupy the upper end of the spectrum. Notably, the highest sentence of **_11 months’_** imprisonment was meted out _Huang Deyi_ who had demonstrably exercised his corrupting influence to recruit a friend who had been, hitherto, completely **_uninvolved_** in any dealings with unlicensed moneylenders to assist in his activities, as would be the situation in the **_instant_** case.

### Sentence received by co-accused Low Swee Keng in the instant case.

30     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of **_at least 14 months’_** against Mr Kuan, and used the sentences imposed against the co-accused (in another district court on 5 September 2019) as a reference point.

31     Along with the proceeded charges set out above, co-accused Loh Swee Keng also consented to one other Moneylender’s Act[^13] harassment and three unrelated mischief charges[^14] being taken into consideration for sentencing, and was sentenced to a global term of **_10 months’ imprisonment_** with Moneylender’s Act charge (nine months) and a theft charge (one month) to ordered to run consecutively.

### Sentencing address by DPP

32     The learned DPPs basis articulated their grounds for Mr Kuan to receive a global 14 month sentence sought as follows[^15].

> 5    Based on (co-accused Loh Swee Keng’s) sentences for the mirror charges, **_the accused should face at least 9 months’ imprisonment on each proceeded charge._**

> 6    Further, given that the two proceeded charges involve different victims at different locations, the sentences for each charge should run consecutively (_Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span>.There are distinct legally protected interests being violated and to order the sentences to run concurrently would effectively grant the accused an unwarranted discount for additional offending (at \[38\] of _Raveen Balakrishnan_).

> 7    This would yield a presumptive sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment. However, this aggregate sentence risks running (afoul) of the totality principle, in view of the fact that “_an aggregation resulting in a longer sentence is going to carry a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the cumulative and overall criminality of the case_” (_Raveen Balakrishnan_ at \[77\]).

> 8    Accordingly, the presumptive sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment should be mitigated down to **at least 14 months’ imprisonment**.

> This would accurately reflect the fact that the accused has a higher level of culpability than Loh for the same offences. It would also account for the fact that the accused faces 3 TIC HUML charges, as opposed to the single HUML charge taken into consideration for Loh’s sentencing.

> 9    The Prosecution therefore submits that an aggregate sentence of **at least 14 months’ imprisonment** is warranted on the circumstances of the present case.

> \[Emphasis in **_bold italics_** added, Emphasis in **bold** in the original\]

33     The address has been reproduced _in extensio_ to allow a full discussion of the considerations involved. I was generally in agreement with the following propositions, both those which were explicitly stated and what was implicit within the context of their sentencing address:

> (i)     Given that the two men were co-accused persons in two similar moneylender harassment charges, there should be, for sentencing parity, a general **_co-relation_** between Mr Kuan’s sentence and the one meted out to Mr Loh in respect of the base sentence for each charge.

> (ii)     Even within the parameters of parity in sentencing, there should be a degree of **_differentiation_** between the two men, given Mr Kuan should have a ‘_higher level of culpability’_ as he had consented to the taking into consideration of **_three more_** moneylender harassment charges, where Mr Loh had only **_one_** such charge taken into consideration during his sentencing. I would agree with this submission, as I do note that the **_degree and manner_** of Mr Kuan’s offending in the TIC charges was more **_varied_** than Mr Loh’s. Mr Kuan would undertake his harassment activities on a **_solo_** basis (DAC-905538-2019 and DAC-911875-2019), as well as with Mr Loh’s assistance (DAC-911974-2019). I would also flag the holding of the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGCA 35</span>, that TIC charges should be given greater currency in sentencing they involve the **_same genre of offence_** (at \[38\]:

>> 38    Section 178(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code does not mandate that, where TIC offences are present, the court must increase the sentence which would normally have been imposed for the offences proceeded with in the absence of TIC offences. **But, if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded** **_with would be increased_** (see _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 77). This is common-sensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences. **_This would_** **a fortiori****_be the case where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar in nature…_** \[Emphasis added\]

> (iii)     Given that there are only two proceeded charges, the proper expression to give effect to Mr Kuan’s _higher culpability_ would be for the sentences in the two proceeded charges to run **_consecutively_**, with appropriate adjustments to arrive at a global sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment, as against confederate Loh Swee Keng’s global term of 10 months’ imprisonment. I am in agreement that consecutive sentencing in the instant circumstances would accord with the principles enunciated in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (which will be explained in detail later in these grounds), but I disagreed with the **_extent_** of the uplift as I was of the view that it would be more consonant to the tenets of fairness and proportionality that Mr Kuan receive a global sentence of a 12-month term, rather than the 14 months’ imprisonment advocated by the learned DPP.

### Points raised in mitigation plea

34     Defence counsel Johnny Seah rendered a brief oral mitigation[^16] where he extolled his client’s early plea of guilt and hitherto clean record. has argued that the principle of parity required his client to receive the same nine-month sentence as accomplice Loh Swee Keng. Counsel’s view was that Mr Loh deservedly received a global sentence of ten months’ imprisonment as he was consecutively sentenced to a month’s imprisonment for ‘_an additional charge of theft’_[^17], and that the theft offence was disparate from the moneylender harassment offence. Counsel also objected to the prosecution’s characterisation of his client bearing greater culpability on account of his (Mr Kuan’s) instigation of Mr Loh to join in the endeavour to harass debtors for profit, as well as his direct connection with the principal unlicensed moneylender from whom he took instructions, and disbursed payments to Mr Loh. Mr Seah’s view was that strict parity should follow as ‘_these are common intention charges…they were both present at the same time for both offences_’ and that ‘_both are the pawns of the moneylender’’_[^18]_._ Counsel reiterated that he ‘_could not see the distinction against foot soldiers’_ and cautioned against ‘_microscopic assessment_’ leading to _‘no end in sentencing’_.[^19] Counsel referenced the first line in the first paragraph of the case of _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span> and quoted Menon CJ that ‘_Consistency in sentencing is a key principle in our criminal justice system’[^20]_ to justify his position that Mr Kuan should receive **_concurrent_** nine month sentences for his moneylending harassment charges (as had been meted out to Mr Loh) and thus be sentenced to a **_global term_** of nine months’ imprisonment.

35     With respect, Mr Seah’s superficial reading of the first line of the case had apparently caused him to miss the fact that _Chong Han Rui_ is a strong authority for the proposition that the principle of parity allows, indeed **_requires_**, co-accused persons performing different roles in a common criminal enterprise to be differentially sentenced, where there is a **_relevant difference_** in their roles. This was, of course, quite the converse of what learned counsel was proposing for the court to do.

### The application of the principle of parity where co-offenders play different roles

36     The strongest point in the prosecution’s case for a heavier **_global_** sentence for Mr Kuan on account of his concomitantly higher culpability came from the learned DPPs submission that there should be a differentiation between roles played by Mr Kuan and Mr Loh[^21]:

> 2    The proceeded charges under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) (“**MLA**”) involve common intention between the accused and Loh. The accused recruited an acquaintance, Loh Swee Keng (“**Loh**”) to carry out acts of harassment with him on behalf of unlicensed moneylenders. **_Therefore, even though the accused’s actual conduct only involved pasting notes and not using bicycle locks on the gates, his culpability is actually higher than that of Loh, since he recruited Loh to perform his acts of harassment and paid him for his services_**. \[Emphasis added\]

### Considering the parameters of parity

37     In looking at the issue of parity in sentencing (and in light of defence counsel’s reference in his oral mitigation plea), it would be apt to closely consider the case of _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span>, where Chief Justice Menon reiterated the principle[^22] that that sentences meted out to co-offenders who are party to a **_common criminal enterprise_** should not be **_unduly disparate_** from each other. It is also important to note that the judgment also holds that co-conspirators sharing similar level of culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should concomitantly receive more severe punishments.

38     In _Chong Han Rui_, the appellant had contested his being given a reformative training sentence, while a co-accused person was given a sentence of probation for jointly committed criminal acts, which included moneylender harassment offences. The High Court noted that that the co-offender, dubbed ‘**_B_**’’ was ‘clearly a more culpable offender than the Appellant for several reasons’, holding[^23] that:

> … **_First, B was the instigator, while the Appellant was essentially a follower. Two facts in particular attested to this: (a) B was the one who roped the Appellant in to commit the acts leading to the Harassment Offence_**; and (b) B was also the one who learnt about the _(a certain gang)_ allegedly recruiting members in _(another gang’s)_ “territory”, and then incited the other _(gang’s)_ members to confront their opponents. It was this that led to the Appellant being involved in the Rioting Offence.

39     In _Chong Han Rui’s_ case, the offender’s reformative training sentence was set aside and a term of probation substituted. Significantly, this case demonstrates that there can be gradations of culpability among co-offenders, where the person who _‘roped in another’_ carries a greater level of responsibility than one who is regarded as _‘essentially a follower’_.

40     The High Court made it clear in the penultimate paragraph of _Chong Han Rui_ that the assessment of manner that the doctrine of parity ought be applied, where the juxtaposition of the relative levels of culpability between co-accused persons was a fact sensitive exercise, where the court is required to ensure a fair and consistent result[^24]:

> 52.     **_I emphasise however that the parity principle is not to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner. Rather, it is an important aid to the sentencing court to ensure that sentencing of co-offenders is done in a manner that is broadly consistent and fair._** But ultimately, what is consistent and fair depends on the facts of the case at hand. Thus, in _Public Prosecutor v Marzuki bin Ahmad and another appeal_<span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 623</span>, I declined to apply the principle of parity as between the giver and the receiver in a corruption case, highlighting that the parity principle must yield to the particular circumstances presented (see at \[45\]). **_Similarly, I make the point here that it is not the law that every co-offender in a common criminal enterprise must be identically charged or sentenced. Rather, the court will have to consider all the circumstances of each case before arriving at the appropriate sentence…_**

### Whether any ‘relevant differences’ exist to call for adjustments to strict sentencing parity

41     To sum up the above analysis, parity is desirable as a **_general_** principle, as this promotes fairness and consistency. Nevertheless, _Chong Han Rui_ makes it clear where two individuals are engaged in a common criminal enterprise, the sentencing court is **_still_** required to assess if there any basis to adjust or vary this presumptive parity. This is explicit where CJ Menon holds at \[42\] and \[43\] of the judgment:

> 42     **_An offender who has a more culpable role in a criminal enterprise should be dealt with more severely than an accomplice who played a lesser role_** (_Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[44\]).

> 43    In my judgment, in the present circumstances, the principle of parity demanded that the Appellant should not be punished _more_ severely than B…

42     In this regard, _Chong Han Rui_ also referenced the case of _Public Prosecutor v Ramlee and Anor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR 539</span>. _Ramlee_ has been subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v Norhisham bin Mohamad Dahlan_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR 48</span>; <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGCA 44</span>, Yong CJ held at \[7\] that:

> \[7\]    Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is **_a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances_**: see _Archbold_ (1998), para 5-153. An offender who has received a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of appeal if the disparity is serious. This is even where the sentences viewed in isolation are not considered manifestly excessive… \[Emphasis added\]

43     There is, my judgement a sound basis for **_differentiation_** in sentencing for the distinct roles assumed between Mr Kuan and Mr Loh. Mr Loh would not even have been involved were it not for Mr Kuan’s blandishments to make some money, as he (Mr Loh) had no antecedents for this manner of activity. Mr Kuan’s role in enticing Mr Loh is all too evident in the Statement of Facts[^25] which Mr Loh had admitted to. Mr Kuan plainly had played a dominant or **_senior_** role, having taken instructions from his principal, planned and co-ordinated the after-action documentation, despite having taken a relative ‘**_back seat’_**.in the actual execution of the offence. This instant case has close parallels with _Public Prosecutor v Amin bin Aman_, MA-9117-2018-01. I handled Mr Amin’s case, while those of his co-conspirators were dealt with in other courts. An analysis of the sentences imposed might offer some insight on how persons with different roles and levels in a conspiracy receive sentences commensurate with their responsibility in planning, supervising and executing a crime. The interplay between the role played or responsibility undertaken between co-accused in the same offence, and the appropriate sentence that should consequentially be meted to each offender, is an equally salient aspect of the instant case.

### Heavier sentences meted out for senior members a conspiracy who planned and/or supervised, but did not execute the act, as demonstrated by PP v Amin bin Aman and connected cases

44     My understanding is that Mr Kuan has reservations about his sentence as given his more apparently ‘passive’ role in perpetrating the actual acts for harassment, especially in his not performing the locking of the gates, and restricting his own role to placing debtor notes. In sentencing, however, the court must take a more holistic view of the relative roles of all involved parties. Mr Kuan’s role, as proposer to engage in the criminal conduct, his being a conduit with the principal _‘Joseph’_, being a supervisor and documentarian of the commission of the crime, and giving a post-action report to his principal is analogous with that of the offender in _Public Prosecutor_ v _Mohammad Amin Bin Aman_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 122</span>. The case involved a plan by a certain Lim Hong Liang, who had engaged his associate; one Ong Hock Chye, to undertake an assault against a love rival, who had persisted in his liaison with Mr Lim’s ‘mistress’ despite warnings and an earlier assault. The contemplated act involved a revenge attack by inflicting a permanent scar on the victim’s face. Mr Ong had, _via_ a middleman, been introduced to and recruited Mr Amin to perform the deed. Mr Amin had in turn engaged other persons, including one Nur Muhammad Irwan Bin Mohd Ngat, the individual who ultimately inflicted the actual injury. After Mr Amin who had roped in Mr Irwan, **_both_** men had worked closely together (with a group of other individuals) in stalking the victim, although **_only_** Mr Amin had a line of contact with the principal, who provided resources and support, including GPS co-ordinates of the car the victim and his paramour were travelling in (which had been gifted to her by Mr Lim).

45     Within the Statement of Facts admitted by Mr Amin; Mr Amin, Mr Irwan and another man, had acted in concert in the assault on the victim, with all three having pre-planned **_distinct_** roles. The men had approached the seated victim in a _pincer movement_ to cut off his path of escape. The third man had punched the victim and distracted him, allowing a window of opportunity for Mr Irwan, armed with a pen knife, to run over from a different direction to slash the victim on his face. Mr Amin was **_not_** a **_direct assailant_**, but had been there to supervise and report the completion of their malevolent mission, including the sending of photographic proof that a disfiguring wound had indeed been completed. Mr Amin had thereafter collected the remainder of the contracted sum of $2000 The penultimate aspect of these facts course being on all fours with Mr Kuan’s role in the instant case. The four[^26] aforementioned individuals were charges for abetment in a conspiracy to inflict grievous hurt by an instrument for stabbing or cutting contrary to section 326 of the Penal Code, with the proceedings heard in three district courts.

### Variance in imposed sentences for the members of conspiracy, with highest sentences for ringleaders and senior members

46     Mr Irwan, who had inflicted the singular disfiguring laceration, but who had been at the lowest level of the conspiracy, received a sentence of **_four years’ and six months’_** imprisonment, along with 6 strokes of the cane, upon his plea of guilt. When Mr Amin’s case came before me, I imposed a term of four years and three months’ imprisonment, along with five strokes of the cane for the section 326 Penal Code offence. To be clear, the principal reason that Mr Amin’s sentence was **_marginally_** lower than Mr Irwan’s was because I had decided that he (Mr Amin) should be consecutively sentenced for that charge with two other proceeded charges; an LT1 drug consumption charge and a Societies Act charge. As a ‘standalone’ sentence, I was of the view that a sentence of **_four years and nine months_** (with caning) would have been appropriate for the section 326 Penal Code offence. A measure of downward titration of the sentence in the section 326 charge was, nevertheless, necessary to ensure that Mr Amin’s global sentence (which came to a total of 11 years, nine months’ imprisonment, and 11 strokes of the cane) would be a just and proportionate one. The two men **_higher_** in the chain received concomitantly higher sentences; Mr Lim Hong Liang (who was aged 55, and thus no longer eligible for caning) received **_six years’ imprisonment_**, and Mr Ong Hock Chye received a term of **_five and a half years’_** imprisonment and caning of six strokes[^27]. The co-relation of a higher sentence with seniority and planning and supervisory roles should thus be quite obvious. This would be the case even if the offender has chosen to take a less active role in the actual **_physical execution_** of the criminal act (as Mr Kuan had so chosen in the instant case). After all, a senior member would generally be in a position to _‘call the shots’_, define his own role, and delegate menial or less favoured duties to subordinate or junior conspiracy members.

### Whether the accused should have received a higher global sentence than his co-accused

47     My understanding is that Mr Kuan feels a measure of unfairness as Mr Loh’s sentence on three proceeded charges eventuated in consecutive sentencing where the Moneylender’s Act charge, which carried a _higher_ tariff of nine months, was taken with a theft charge, which carried a _lower_ tariff of one month’s imprisonment, with the other Moneylender’s Act harassment charge running concurrently. Hence, where his case involved just two charges, Mr Kuan had apparently thought it would be only fair for the **_two charges_**, which carried high tariffs to run consecutively.

### Differences in role and motivation between the co-accused persons

48     Defence counsel never disputed Mr Kuan’s role as the one who introduced the notion of making money through harassment activities, stating rather flippantly that ‘_my client take offence to the word ‘recruit’_’,[^28] as there was no need to actively seek to ‘recruit’ Mr Loh, as ‘_my client told him_ (what) _he… wanted to do… and he_ (Mr Loh) _wanted to participate’_[^29]_._ Nevertheless, looking from a _sine qua non_ perspective, Mr Loh had been enticed into this by Mr Kuan’s proposal ‘**_to earn additional income’_** by engaging in debtor harassment activities, and would not have engaged in the same without this perverse nudge by Mr Kuan. Mr Loh was, according to his mitigation plea suffering from familial strife and financial problems[^30], before being persuaded by Mr Kuan. Defence counsel in the instant case did not offer any explanation for Mr Kuan’s actions In his rather terse oral plea in mitigation, counsel alludes to _‘(b)oth were talking and both were in trouble’_[^31] but never deigned to specify the ‘_trouble’_ that Mr Kuan faced, unlike the carefully drafted written mitigation plea tendered for Mr Loh’s benefit. Rather ironically, counsel contended that ‘_no real facts are being put across to the Court’_ by the prosecution [^32]to demonstrate that Mr Kuan should be assessed to have greater culpability.

49     Given the paucity of cogent information from the oral plea in mitigation, the court is required to glean from the Statement of Facts, and extrapolate on the factual matrix revealed from an analysis of Mr Kuan’s pattern of conduct from facts stated in both the proceeded and TIC charges. These support Mr Kuan’s admission that his motive was for the **_venal_** purpose of earning ‘_additional income’_, as there was no evidence of any other pressing stressor, such as his being threatened by moneylenders to do their bidding.

50     There also appeared to be no obvious financial urgency within the background of Mr Kuan’s offending. This is evidenced by the accused’s recruiting of Mr Loh to assist in performing jobs that he could very well do **_alone_**, and which he had indeed done on at least two occasions, as reflected in **_two_** of the TIC charges[^33]. This conclusion can be drawn because Mr Kuan’s engagement of Mr Loh would inevitably require him to **_share_** half (or more) of his receipts from the principal ‘_Joseph_’.

51     It is nevertheless likely that Mr Loh’s assistance in **_driving_** him to the debtor’s addresses promoted a level of efficiency which would enable him to commit more debtor harassment crimes. The expediency of Mr Loh’s service is quite evident from the fact that the two proceeded charges were committed some 40 minutes apart, and involved harassment activities in disparate addresses in different parts of Singapore[^34]. This arrangement, especially in Mr Kuan’s generous gesture of giving Mr Loh a $150 flat rate for his (Mr Loh’s) assistance, despite his (Mr Kuan’s) own payments from the commissioning moneylender varying from $200- $300, does not show desperation, as much as the accused’s development of a thoroughly premeditated _modus operandi_ to maximise gains by harassing multiple addresses with the minimum amount of time and effort (After picking the accused up, Mr Loh would **_both_** drive to the identified address and lock the debtor’s gate, leaving Mr Kuan to just leave the debtor’s note, and document the completion of the task).

52     Looking at the precedent cases mentioned earlier in these grounds which saw a span of sentences of eight to 11 months, it was plain that Mr Kuan should receive a sentence at, or even **_above_**, the upper end of the range. Mr Kuan’s criminal acts combined the **_worst_** elements of _Belveder Lai’s_ and _Huang Deyi’s_ manners of offending. This was because _Belveder Lai_, who received 40 weeks’ imprisonment, became involved despite not facing financial stress, but was a recruit and not a recruiter. _Huang Deyi_ on the other hand, had indeed recruited _Belveder Lai_ but **_did_** in fact, face financial stress. Hence Mr Kuan, for his enticement of Mr Loh, as well as his motive of pecuniary gain in the absence of moneylender duress or other pressing financial stress, should properly receive a sentence in excess of the 11 months’ imprisonment meted out to _Belveder Lai’s_ co-accused _Huang Dey_**_i_**.

### Consecutive sentencing on the two proceeded charges

53     The only remaining question is whether it would be just in the circumstances to run the two sentences consecutively as a condign punishment for Mr Kuan. The accused did **_agree_** to plead guilty, presumably after some negotiation, to the two proceeded charges (with three others to be taken into consideration). If Mr Kuan, who was, of course represented, had entertained any notion that this would somehow bind the prosecution not to call for the sentences to run consecutively, he would have been misconceived.

### The general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences

54     Following the case of _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span>, where the honourable Menon CJ held at \[41\]:

> 41.    In my judgment, _as a general rule_, a multiple offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively… \[Emphasis in the original\]

the law is well-settled in this respect. I am of the firm view that the proceeded charges, which committed some forty minutes of each other, are two **_distinct_** and **_unrelated_** offences. Mr Kuan’s offending does not involve any ‘_single invasion of the same legally protected interest’[^35]_ which in the case of _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> would have rendered consecutive sentencing less appropriate Ineluctable indicia of Mr Kuan’s serial offending not being part of a single transaction[^36] would be fact that the victims; Ahamed Saifudeen Abdul Shukkur and Khoo Gek Chiang were **_unrelated_**, their only common thread being Mr Ahamed’s landlord and Mr Khoo’s unfortunate consorting with unlicensed moneylenders. One act was committed in the Yishun to the north of Singapore, and the other to Simei in the far eastern region, a distance of some 25 kilometres[^37]. Mr Kuan was also paid a separate sum of $200-$300 for **_each_** act of harassment[^38].

55     In _Raveen Balakrishnan_, Chief Justice Menon CJ explains the basis for consecutive sentencing at \[42\]:

> 42     First, this should be so as a matter of first principle. **_Since the offences are unrelated, each offence committed by a multiple offender should attract its own distinct consequence. There is no reason in principle why a second or subsequent offence should attract less or possibly no distinct consequence just by reason of the fact that it is one of a number of separate offences for which the offender is being sentenced._** All else being equal, a multiple offender bears greater culpability and will have caused greater harm than an offender who has committed only a single offence. As observed in _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“_Sentencing Practice”)_ (at p 21):

>> Multiple wrongdoing by a multiple wrongdoer, as a general rule, must be viewed more severely than single offending involving similar offences. The community (and the victim(s)) have suffered more because of the greater harm done.

> Single offenders and multiple offenders therefore ought not in principle be treated in like manner, and the sentencing approach should reflect this. \[Emphasis added\]

56     The rationale was further elucidated at \[43\], where the honourable Chief Justice explains:

> 43    Secondly, in many situations, concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would not adequately serve, and in fact may undermine, the sentencing considerations that underlie the individual sentences comprising the aggregate term. **_For one thing, the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would afford an offender who has already committed an offence less or no real incentive to refrain from committing a further offence, in so far as such a sentencing position would result in the offender not having to bear any real consequence for the further offending. This creates a distorted incentive that detracts from the deterrent value of the individual sentences notionally imposed_**….

### Consecutive sentencing for two unrelated offences as a general rule and statutorily mandated consecutive sentencing under s307 of the COC are complimentary principles

57     Given that the co-accused Loh Swee Keng faced three charges, section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides for an offender to face consecutive terms for at least two sentences where sentences are imposed for three or more offences. The High Court in _Raveen Balakrishnan_ has made it clear that the operation of section 307(1) CPC and the doctrine of consecutive sentences distinct offences are complementary principles. Menon CJ states at \[52\]:

> 52    The general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences does not contravene s 307(1) or render it otiose. The provision retains its relevance in that it operates regardless of whether the multiple offences are related or otherwise. Therefore, even if all or some of the offences are related, s 307(1) applies to require that at least two sentences should run consecutively. **_Indeed, in my judgment, s 307(1) of the CPC, the one-transaction rule, and the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences should be regarded as complementary principles that collectively help a court decide how sentences should be ordered to run in relation to a multiple offender_**. \[Emphasis added\]

### Consecutive sentencing to deter serial UML harassment sprees

58     This need to visit consecutive punishments where two (or more) offences are committed is a particularly cogent where UML harassment crimes are concerned, as once the materials of the ‘trade’ (printed debtor notes, bicycle locks, spray paint cannisters and markers) have been aggregated and logistical elements (car or other means of transport where the paraphernalia could be concealed or stored) were in place, there would be all the more temptation to go on a **_spree_** of serial offending to maximise pay-outs from their principals, if there was an expectation that offenders would receive concurrent sentencing if caught, merely on the basis that the offences were committed within a short interval of each other.

59     In a reprise of my _ex-tempore_ sentencing remarks[^39], which I now paraphrase and amplify, Mr Kuan plainly played a more significant role as recruiter of the co-accused, supervisor and documentarian of the operation, and finally as conduit and collector of payment from the principal. Severe sentences are imposed for acts of UML harassment cases for obvious reasons. This is principally because harassers are both metaphorically and in actuality, the **_arms and legs_** of illegal moneylenders. These UML principals who have no power but for the fact of harassers of Mr Kuan’s ilk lending their arms and legs to afford the reach and mobility to enable their operations and enforce their nefarious demands for usurious repayments.by instilling fear of dire consequences, along with the attendant shame, alienation and stigmatisation from debtors’ neighbours from the revelation of their illicit borrowings. In this instance, Mr Kuan should regard himself as fortunate that no vandalism occurred because that would have obliged me to impose even more severe sentences[^40] even though, of course, I note Mr. Kuan would not have been eligible for caning.

### Locking up gates should be regarded as an aggravated form of UML harassment

60     The use of a bicycle lock to lock the grille gates of the debtors’ premises was likely a base tactic primarily calculated to annoy, stress and inconvenience the occupants, as impose a measure of intimidation to debtors of the moneylender’s extra-legal reach to impose his will, and a precursive warning that more would come upon the debtors’ continued failure to comply. Locking should nevertheless be regarded as an **_aggravated_** form of harassment, as the act of locking a gate without leaving an identifiable key, and leaving the occupant(s) ‘imprisoned’ in his own premises is inherently **_hazardous_** and shows a patently callous disregard for the personal safety of all persons within the apartment. The incarceration of the persons within, albeit temporary, leaves them vulnerable in event of any emergency situation, such as the exacerbation of the pre-existing condition of person with asthma or cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease which may be triggered by the trauma of the locking, or another cause; or upon the onset of an electrical or gas fire within the premises. It is for this reason that sentences of **_eight to 11_** months have been imposed on individual charges of UML harassment by locking.

### Reiteration of reasons for global sentence

61     The learned DPP had been mindful of the need to reconcile all the salient considerations in this case when the recommendation of a global term of **_14 months’_** imprisonment had been made. The global sentence should properly be indexed to co-accused Loh Swee Keng’s sentences for the mirror charges, and that Mr Kuan should face at least 9 months’ imprisonment on each proceeded charge. As per the foregoing analysis, I was also in agreement that the two proceeded charges, which involve different victims and different locations should properly attract **_consecutive_** sentences to stay faithful to the principles enunciated in _Raveen Balakrishnan_ where the accused must be fully accountable for the distinct legally protected interests being violated and where concurrent sentencing would effectively grant Mr Kuan an unwarranted discount for additional offending.

62     I also agreed with the prosecution the presumptive aggregate sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment risked running afoul of the totality principle, and that such a sentence wold be proscribed _Raveen Balakrishnan[^41]_ as ‘_an aggregation resulting in a longer sentence is going to carry a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the cumulative and overall criminality of the case_’, and their proposal that _the ‘presumptive sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment should be mitigated down to at least 14 months’ imprisonment’_, was a rational suggestion, save that the scaling down did not go far enough.

63     I was of the view that a global sentence of 12 months, which is a two-month uplift from the sentence received by Loh would suffice to reflect the fact that the accused has a higher level of culpability than Loh for the same ‘mirror offences’, and also account for Mr Kuan also being answerable for the three TIC UML harassment charges. To be clear, I dismissed counsel’s suggestion that there should be no _‘_distinction against_(sic)_ foot soldiers’, as Mr Kuan had an advantage in his being the conduit with _‘Joseph’_, and thus be at liberty to define or limit his own role in the actual execution of the harassment operation. Far from being a mere ‘foot-soldier’, Mr Kuan was at least a junior officer or commander within counsel’s chosen analogy. Nevertheless, I noted his lack of antecedents, and decided that while a term of **_eight months’_** imprisonment for each charge would have **_ordinarily[^42]_** been appropriate, the aggregation principle, and the need to ensure relative parity with co-accused Loh Swee Keng’s punishment, as well as proportionality in sentencing would require me to instead impose two consecutive terms of **_six-months’_** imprisonment, to achieve a global term of 12 months’ imprisonment.

64     Upon these premises, the following sentences were imposed in the court mention on 28 January 2020:

65     Mr Kuan was allowed a deferment to attend to personal matters until 6 February 2020. He filed his notice of appeal on 6 February 2020, and is presently on bail pending this appeal.

66     In this case I have striven to impose a condign punishment which was responsive to Mr Kuan’s admitted degree of criminality. Given his discrete offending at two distinct sites, and his senior role in the operation, consecutive sentences were called for. Nevertheless, the usual term of nine months’ imprisonment, was ameliorated to consecutive terms of six-months’ imprisonment, yielding a final sentence which was just two months higher than that of his demonstrably less culpable associate-in- crime. Given these premises, I would not regard my sentence to be excessively harsh. If anything, the final sentence might well be regarded as having leant far more on the side of leniency.

[^22]: His honour states in _Chong Han Rui_ at \[1\] that :1       Consistency in sentencing is a key principle in our criminal justice system. This is rooted in the notion that all are equal before the law (_Public Prosecutor v Ng Sae Kiat and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 167</span> (“_Ng Sae Kiat_”) at \[76\], citing _Green v R_ (2011) 283 ALR 1 at \[30\]). **The principle of parity in sentencing between co-offenders urges that sentences meted out to co-offenders who are party to a common criminal enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other. To put it simply, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished: **. \[Emphasis added\]

[^25]: 5\. Investigations revealed that sometime in 2017, the accused (_Mr Loh_) became acquainted with Kuan through a mutual friend. Sometime in December 2018, **Kuan invited the accused to earn additional income by assisting an unknown unlicensed moneylender known only as “Joseph”. Kuan promised to share half his remuneration from “Joseph” with the accused.: ** The accused agreed to work for “Joseph” by performing harassment jobs with Kuan. “Joseph” is not an excluded moneylender, an exempt moneylender or authorised to do so by licence.6. The accused and Kuan adopted the same modus operandi in each harassment job performed on behalf of “Joseph”. **Kuan would first receive the debtor’s address from “Joseph” via the WhatsApp messaging application. Thereafter, Kuan would send the address to the accused. The accused would then drive the rented car bearing vehicle number: ** (vehicle number) **to Kuan’s location and fetch him to the debtor’s residence to commit acts of harassment.:**

[^26]: The four men were the **principal: ** members of the conspiracy. Other members who played a more peripheral role were also dealt with. Another associate of Mr **Ron Lim De Mai: ** received a sentence of 36 months and four strokes of the cane _vide_ DAC-917596-2016, for a minor role in the conspiracy. An appeal against this sentence (MA 9095/2018/01) was dismissed. Of Mr Amin’s team, one; Ms **Nur Atika Fuziana Binte Sherhan: **, who had assisted in tracking the victim and his companion, was treated as a youthful offender at age 20, and was sentenced to undergo reformative training. The third person in the group; Mr **Juhari Bin Ab Karim: **. who had inflicted a punch pleaded guilty to a charge of causing hurt and received a 12-month term of imprisonment.

It was during this time when the family finances were extremely tight, that our client began to have heated arguments with his wife. Our client’s wife always argued with him, about not having enough money to run the family.8. That was the extent of our client’s life until the date of the commission of these offences. He was scrounging for monies at work, to pay off the said Company’s debts and after work, when he returns home, he would face issues with his wife.9. There was no peace at all in our client’s life.10. **Sometime in 2015, in desperation, our client went to the licensed money lenders to borrow monies. This only led to more problems for our client: **.11. Our client was unable to cope with his financial troubles…

[^36]: To explain the concept of a transaction in relation to criminal acts by the same offender, the High Court _in Mohamed Shouffee_ cited D A Thomas; Principles of Sentencing (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) where at page p 53, he states:The essence of the one-transaction rule appears to be that consecutive sentences are inappropriate when all the offences taken together constitute a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. The principle applies where two or more offences arise from the same facts — as when the same series of blows constitutes assault occasioning actual bodily harm and wilful ill treatment of a child, or malicious wounding and indecent assault — but the fact that the two offences are committed simultaneously or close together in time does not necessarily mean that they amount to a single transaction. … \[emphasis added\]In _Mohamed Shouffee_, Menon CJ also envisages the running of consecutive sentencing even where the offences can be regarded to be a single transaction in certain situations, at \[41\]: 41     There may well be circumstances where a sentencing judge may order two sentences to run consecutively even though they are in relation to offences that do form part of a single transaction. _One instance of this is where the straightforward application of the one-transaction rule results in the offender benefitting from the court’s failure to have regard to the enhanced culpability that is reflected in the multiplicity of the offences that have been committed_… \[Emphasis added\]

[^41]: At \[77\] of the Judgment in _Raveen Balakrishnan._ Mr Loh had just a single HUML charge taken into consideration for his sentencing.

[^42]: At \[66\] of _Shouffee_ Menon CJ underscored the importance of stating the sentence which ought to have been imposed before a recalibration to allow a proper point of reference to fully understand the context upon which the eventual sentence was imposed, and what it would have been without the countervailing factors which militated an adjustment, so as to preserve the integrity of benchmarks:… By stating explicitly that the individual sentence that would otherwise have been imposed is being recalibrated by reason of the totality principle, the sentencing judge not only demonstrates principled adherence to the applicable sentencing benchmarks but also ensures that the integrity of those benchmarks for the discrete offences is not affected by the recalibration that he has done in the particular case that is before him by reason of the particular facts and circumstances at hand. \[emphasis in original\]
