### Deputy Registrar Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff in this action is claiming for damages suffered from a motor accident against the Defendant, a car rental company. Default interlocutory judgment was entered following the Defendant’s failure to enter an appearance in the action. Before the action proceeded for assessment of damages, the Defendant’s insurers, Ergo Insurance Pte Ltd (the “Insurer”), intervened on the basis that it may fall upon the Insurer to satisfy the final judgment made against the Defendant, pursuant to section 9 of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap. 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“MVA”). At the assessment of damages hearing before me, the Defendant once again failed to appear.

2       Like many uncontested motor accident claims, this action would likely have achieved a straightforward resolution, but for two peculiarities in the Plaintiff’s litigation strategy. First, the Plaintiff _previously brought another action_ against the Defendant premised on what was essentially the _same cause of action_. Second, the Plaintiff, in its pleadings, alleged that the _hirer_ of the vehicle was responsible for the accident. Pertinently, the Plaintiff’s pleaded case did not allege that the Defendant was negligent. Capitalising on these two peculiarities, the Insurer disavowed liability on behalf of the Defendant on two grounds.

> (a)     First, the present action violates section 35 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed), a statute that prohibits claimants from dividing a single cause of action into two or more actions.

> (b)     Second, the Plaintiff’s pleadings do not disclose any actionable claim against the Defendant.

3       Both arguments, particularly the second, sparked a heated debate in written submissions that engaged rather novel issues of law, which I will turn to later. When I heard the arguments, the first question that crossed my mind was whether it is more appropriate to raise these arguments in an application to set aside the default interlocutory judgment. In this regard, it was undisputed that the Insurer has the standing to set aside a default interlocutory judgment (see _Vineshwaran s/o Sambath v Chandrashegaran s/o Rajagopal & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 114</span> at \[19\]). In this case, the Insurer decided against setting aside the default interlocutory judgment. In its view, there is no legal impediment in raising these arguments at the assessment of damages hearing. Unsurprisingly, this prompted the Plaintiff to argue that the arguments raised by the Insurer go towards issues of liability which have already been determined in the default interlocutory judgment, and since the Insurer has foregone the opportunity to set aside the judgment, it is precluded from re-litigating issues of liability in the assessment of damages hearing.

4       Against this backdrop of events, three main issues arose for consideration:

> (a)     Whether present action violates section 35 of the State Courts Act, and if so, whether that violation renders the present action a nullity.

> (b)     If the action is not rendered a nullity, whether it is open to the Insurer to disclaim liability at the assessment of damages hearing without setting aside the interlocutory judgment.

> (c)     If it remains open to the Insurer to disclaim liability, whether the Statement of Claim discloses a reasonable cause of action.

5       In this judgment, I deliver my decision on these issues.

6       On a preliminary note, it is undisputed that the Insurer is entitled to raise all defences that are available to the Defendant and would have a bearing on the Insurer’s interests. The analysis hereunder will therefore proceed on this basis.

## Does s 35 of the State Courts Act render the present action a nullity?

7       It is common ground that the Plaintiff had in MC/MC 8877/2017 (“the First Action”) brought a claim against the same Defendant on the same cause of action. In this regard, the material facts supporting both the First Action and the present action are essentially the same. They both arose from a motor accident that took place on 19 September 2016 between the Plaintiff, who was a riding a motorcycle, and the Defendant, who was the owner of the motor car, which was at all material times driven by its hirer.

8       The First Action was commenced on 26 May 2017. It was discontinued on 24 November 2017. Later on the same day, the Plaintiff filed the present action.

9       I preface my analysis by reproducing section 35 of the State Courts Act:

> A cause of action shall not be divided for the purposes of bringing 2 or more actions.

10     On its plain meaning, the statutory rule clearly prohibits the Plaintiff from filing of the present action. There is no dispute that the same cause of action undergirds the First Action and the present action. In this regard, it is trite that a “cause of action” essentially refers to the essential factual material that supports a claim (_Multistar Holdings Ltd v Geocon Piling & Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 1</span> at \[34\]), and both actions arose from the same negligent act and the same collision. By filing the present action, the Plaintiff has “divided” the cause of action into “two or more actions”, in violation of the statutory prohibition.

11     The purposive interpretation affirms the ordinary meaning of the statute. The High Court has held that the statutory rule manifests the public interest in protecting litigants from being vexed more than once by what is essentially the same claim (_Ng Kong Choon v Tang Wee Goh_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 935</span> (“_Ng Kong Choon_”) at \[64\] citing _Buckland v Palmer_ <span class="citation">\[1984\] 1 WLR 1109</span>). By filing two separate actions for the same claim and serving them both on the Defendant, the Plaintiff had vexed the Defendant more than once, thereby violating the interest that the statute was enacted to protect.

12     The Plaintiff contends that the concern of multiplicity of proceedings does not arise given that the Plaintiff had discontinued the First Action before commencing the present action.[^1] In my judgment, this argument is misguided. It is plain from the provision that the filing of a separate action is enough to invoke the rule, so long as the separate action traverses the same facts. Nothing in the provision requires the first action to be pending. If Parliament had meant to confine the rule to operate against concurrent actions only, one would expect the following words in italics to appear in the provision:

> A cause of action shall not be divided for the purposes of bringing _and maintaining_ 2 or more actions _concurrently_.

13     Indeed, the Court in _Ng Kong Choon_ had considered and rejected the same argument raised by the Plaintiff. There, the claimant argued that the rule applies only when there are proceedings in existence and that the claimant did not fall afoul of the rule since parties had settled and discontinued the prior action. Rejecting this argument and affirming the lower court’s decision to strike out the separate action, Justice Belinda Ang held that the claimant’s interpretation would entail reading the word “bringing” to mean “bringing and maintaining”, which is not how the provision is worded (at \[79\]-\[80\]):

> 79    … \[The claimant’s\] interpretation would involve reading the word “bringing” in s 35 as meaning “bringing and maintaining”. As highlighted by \[the defendant\] before the District Judge, the word “maintaining” is nowhere to be found in the provision.

> 80    In my view, there is nothing in the statutory language (express or implied) that supports \[the claimant’s\] interpretation of s 35. I agree with the District Judge that there is no statutory exception suffixed to s 35 stating, for example, that the provision does not apply when there was no other pending action. …

14     In my view, the Plaintiff’s position is also untenable from a policy standpoint, as it would have the effect of undermining the legislative objective of preventing claimants from unnecessarily vexing defendants with repeated actions. Taking the Plaintiff’s argument to its logical conclusion, it would mean that claimants can file multiple suits against the same defendant in quick succession, so long as they discontinue one suit before they file the next. I have no doubt that defendants confronted with such successive lawsuits would be unduly vexed, perhaps no less than one who is defending concurrent lawsuits. This would stymie the object of the statute and allow the targeted mischief to fester.

15     It is unclear why the Plaintiff chose to discontinue the First Action. Given the differences in the wording of the Statement of Claim filed in the present action, it would appear that the Plaintiff had wanted to amend its pleadings. If that were the case, it could and should have simply amended the pleadings and continued with the First Action. The fact of the matter is that it did not do so, and instead launched another action against the same Defendant, thereby contravening the statutory prohibition. While I observed from the case file of the First Action that the Defendant had yet to take any steps in the First Action before its discontinuation, this does not feature as a relevant consideration in the analytical framework. Section 35 operates as a bright-line rule. It does not provide the Court with the discretion to consider the egregiousness of the breach and the power to tailor the sanction on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, the Court in _Ng Kong Choon_ similarly took the view that the provision leaves no room for the Court to “exercise its discretion” (at \[83\]). In these premises, I am unable to engage in a balancing exercise and weigh the scales of prejudice. In any event, the Plaintiff led no evidence and made no submissions on the prejudice (or the lack thereof) suffered by the Defendant. Thus, while I appreciate that the rule carries draconian consequences for what may have been a minor transgression, the law and the evidence constraints me from making an exception for the Plaintiff.

16     Ordinarily, a defendant seeking to invoke s 35 of the State Courts Act would bring a striking out application under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, 2014 Rev Ed), as the defendant did in _Ng Kong Choon_. Here, not only was a striking out application not taken out, the challenge was raised during the assessment of damages hearing, long after interlocutory judgment has been entered. Is it too late to raise the defence at an assessment of damages hearing? In my view, unorthodox as the Insurer’s approach may be, the answer to this question depends on whether the statutory rule operates as a jurisdictional or substantive bar to the claim. The proper way to raise substantive defences is to set aside the interlocutory judgment. An interlocutory judgment, until and unless set aside, is final as to the issues of liability as pleaded in the Statement of Claim and estops the defendant from re-litigating the same (_Singapore Civil Procedure_ 2020, vol 1 (Hon Justice Chua Lee Ming ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th ed, 2020) (“_Singapore Civil Procedure_”) at para 13/0/11). A jurisdictional defect, however, goes deeper than that. Without the requisite jurisdiction, the Court cannot hear on the substantive merits of a case. Where the Court lacks jurisdiction by statute, it should disclaim jurisdiction, regardless of whether the defendant pleads this in its defence (_Singapore Civil Procedure_ at para 18/8/20). Parties have no power to waive jurisdictional defects (_Rank Xerox (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Ultra Marketing Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 2 SLR(R) 912</span> at \[10\]). Nor can parties create a jurisdiction that does not exist (_Wilkinson v Barking Corporation_ <span class="citation">\[1948\] 1 KB 721</span> at 725, _per_ Asquith LJ). _A fortiori_, an interlocutory judgment entered in default of appearance is not capable of curing a jurisdictional defect.

17     The Insurer contends that the statutory rule, once invoked, deprives the Court of the jurisdiction to hear the substantive merits of the separate action. In support of its position that the statutory rule goes towards the Court’s jurisdiction, the Insurer highlighted that section 35 sits within “Part IV” of the State Courts Act which is entitled “Jurisdiction” and that the rest of the provisions in the same section lay down the jurisdictional basis and parameters of the District and Magistrate’s Court.[^2] I find no reason to disagree with this submission and indeed the Plaintiff did not challenge this either. In my view, the decision to park the provision under that section of the State Courts Act signals Parliament’s intention to treat this as a jurisdictional issue. Statutory interpretation requires having regard to not only the text of the provision but also the context of that provision within the written law as a whole (_Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 850</span> at \[37\]). Headers have been said to form part of the relevant context (see _Regina v Montila_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 WLR 3141</span> at \[36\], cited with approval in _Tee Soon Kay v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 133</span> at \[40\]). So does the surrounding provisions of the statute (_Comptroller of Income Tax v GE Pacific Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 2 SLR(R) 948</span>, cited with approval in _Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 373</span> at \[67\], _per_ Sundaresh Menon CJ).

18     I also agree with the Insurer that the High Court in _Ng Kong Choon_ appeared to have similarly regarded the statutory rule as a matter going towards the jurisdiction of the Court.[^3] The following passages of the decision are illustrative:

> 51    It is not without significance that the statutory prohibition against dividing a single indivisible cause action is confined to courts of limited jurisdiction. Provisions expressed in similar terms as s 35 appear in foreign legislation governing courts of limited jurisdiction. It is immediately evident that the provisions bear much similarity to the scheme of the \[Subordinate Courts Act (“SCA”)\] on three main fronts: (a) jurisdiction of the inferior courts; (b) abandoning the excess part of the claim to give jurisdiction; and (c) division of a single cause of action.

> …

> 61    As stated, the scheme evident in the foreign provisions – jurisdiction of the inferior courts, abandoning the excess part of the claim to give jurisdiction, and division of a single cause of action – is similarly found in the SCA albeit in separate sections of the legislation. There are sections that set up and establish the jurisdictional limit of the District Courts and the Magistrates’ Courts, and there are provisions allowing a plaintiff to abandon any excess amount over the limit of the jurisdiction. Allied to the provisions that give effect to the limited jurisdiction of the District Courts and the Magistrates’ Courts is the requirement that a plaintiff with a single cause of action must bring forward all of his case in one action. …

19     In these premises, I find that the institution of the present action violated s 35 of the State Courts Act. The violation deprived the Court of the jurisdiction to hear the substantive merits of the present action. It follows from this that the present action was null and invalid from the onset.

20     My decision on this issue is enough to dispose of the action. However, given that the first issue engages somewhat novel issues of law, and parties have made extensive submissions on the substantive issue of whether the Defendant (and in turn the Insurer) is entitled to disavow liability without setting aside the default interlocutory judgment, I will proceed to discuss this issue next.

## Can the Insurer disclaim liability without setting aside the interlocutory judgment?

21     To provide context to my analysis, it is apposite to first reproduce the relevant terms of the default interlocutory judgment, as follows:

> No appearance having been entered by the defendant herein, it is this day adjudged that the defendant do pay the plaintiff damages to be assessed with interest and costs reserved to the Registrar hearing the Assessment of Damages.

I will refer to this as the “Interlocutory Judgment”.

22     The Plaintiff argues that the Interlocutory Judgment conclusively determines all issues of liability and leaves the issue of damages as the only live issue to be determined.[^4] Put another way, the Plaintiff’s case is that at the assessment of damages hearing, the Court is precluded from examining the issue of liability and can only assess the appropriate amount of damages. In support of this argument, the Plaintiff cited the following passage in _Singapore Civil Procedure_ at para 13/2/1:[^5]

> **“interlocutory judgment ... for damages to be assessed”—** The term “interlocutory judgment” means that such a judgment is interlocutory only as to amount, and is final as to the right of the plaintiff to recover damages, together with such costs as the amount thereof, when ascertained, entitles him to.

> The practice is to enter final judgment after assessment as a matter of course for the amount found due, together with costs.

23     In an ordinary case where the claimant’s pleaded case traverses issues of liability and enters default interlocutory judgment on that basis, I would agree with the Plaintiff that the defendant has to set aside the default judgment in order to challenge the issue of liability as pleaded. Take for instance a claim for damages sustained in an accident. The claimant pleads that the defendant was negligent and the negligent act of his caused the accident and the Plaintiff to suffer damages. Where the claim is for an unliquidated amount of damages and the Defendant fails to enter an appearance, the Plaintiff may proceed to enter a default interlocutory judgment. The effect of the interlocutory judgment is to hold the defendant liable for the accident, leaving the quantum of damages to be assessed by the Court. Until and unless the default interlocutory judgment is set aside, the defendant is estopped from re-litigating allegations made in the Statement of Claim. Typically, such allegations include the commission of the negligent act and the causal link between the negligent act and the accident. But it remains open to the defendant to challenge the quantum of damages. Issues that go towards the quantum of damages typically include the causal link between the accident and the damages claimed and the appropriate quantification of the damages suffered (see for instance, _Tan Chee Kiang v Huang He Jue and others_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 250</span>; _Menjit Singh s/o Hari Singh v Ong Lay Peng_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 11</span>; and _Lee Mui Yeng v Ng Tong Yoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 46</span>).

24     The case before me, as I have alluded to above, is not a typical motor accident case. The Plaintiff’s decision not to allege that the car rental company was liable (vicariously or otherwise) for the acts of its hirer complicates matters. His pleaded case was that the _hirer_ was negligent in driving the vehicle and that negligent act of the _hirer_ caused the accident. In my judgment, since the pleaded case did not allege liability against the Defendant, it follows that the interlocutory judgment – from which his pleaded case arose – could not possibly give rise to any determination of liability _as against the Defendant_. This stems from the well-established proposition that, in an adversarial system like ours, parties cannot reach beyond the ambit of their pleaded case. As Sharma J held in _Janagi v Ong Boon Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1971\] 2 MLJ 196</span> (cited with approval in _Loy Chin Associates Pte Ltd v Autohouse Trading Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 740</span> at \[20\]):

> … \[T\]he matters on which the parties are at issue are determinable by an examination of the pleadings. An issue arises when a material proposition of law or fact is affirmed by one party and denied by the other. _The court is not entitled to decide a suit on a matter on which no issue has been raised by the parties. It is not the duty of the court to make out a case for one of the parties when the party concerned does not raise or wish to raise the point._

> \[emphasis added\]

25     The terms of the Interlocutory Judgment underscores the importance of analysing the issue from the perspective of the Plaintiff’s pleaded case. The terms of the Interlocutory Judgment, on its own, do not reveal the exact issues that have been determined as between the parties. Unlike final judgments that typically sets out rights and liabilities within the four corners of the judgment, the phrase “the defendant do pay the plaintiff damages to be assessed” says nothing about the premise upon which the Defendant is adjudged to be liable for damages. It is difficult to construe the Interlocutory Judgment _in vacuo_. To make sense of the Interlocutory Judgment, one has to read the Statement of Claim. When one considers the allegations made in the Statement of Claim, it becomes apparent that the Defendant had not admitted to any liability for the accident. At best, the Defendant admitted to the negligence of its hirer. But as I will explain at \[37\]-\[43\] below, this admission is irrelevant since the negligence of the hirer cannot be imputed to the Defendant. For present purposes, since the Defendant has made no admission of liability, it should remain open to the Defendant to challenge issues of liability at the assessment of damages hearing without having to set aside the Interlocutory Judgment.

26     Properly understood, the Plaintiff’s proposition stated at \[22\] above is perhaps applicable to the vast majority of the cases but certainly inapplicable to outlier cases like the one before me. In my judgment, default interlocutory judgments are not conclusive and final of _all_ issues of liability that may possibly arise; they are conclusive and final as to the issues as _pleaded in the Statement of Claim_. The corollary to this is that, at the assessment of damages hearing, the defendant can raise any issue that does not contradict the matters pleaded in the Statement of Claim. Further support for this proposition can be found in the English Court of Appeal case of _Lunnun v Singh & Ors_ \[1999\] TLR 541, _The Times Law Reports_, 19 July 1999 at 541, where Justice Jonathan Parker held:

> … \[T\]he default judgment was conclusive of issues of liability _in the statement of claim_. That was the full extent of the issues decided.

> Therefore all questions going to quantification remained open at the damages hearing and there was direct support from both cases of \[_Turner v Toleman_ (unreported, January 15, 1999)\] and \[_Maes Finance Ltd and Another v A. L. Phillips & Co (a Firm)_ (_The Times_ March 25, 1997; \[1997\] TLR 157)\] for that finding.

> _The underlying principle was that a defendant could raise any point on a quantification hearing save the extent that it was inconsistent with the determination on liability_ in either a full judgment after a contested hearing, summary judgment or a default judgment.

> \[emphasis added\]

27     Similarly, in _Carbopego-Abastecimento de Combustiveis SA v AMCI Export Corporation_ \[2006\] EWHC 72, Justice Aikens found that the effect of interlocutory judgments was to put an end to issues of liability _as pleaded_ only. An interlocutory judgment does not give the claimant free reign to assert fresh claims at the assessment of damages hearing. In this regard, he said at \[14\]-\[15\]:

> 14    ...\[W\]here a judgment in default has been granted on the question of liability, that judgment is conclusive on the issue of liability of the Defendant to the Claimant, _as pleaded in the Particulars of Claim_. Therefore, if a Claimant has alleged that the Defendant was in breach of contract, that cannot be challenged after the default judgment has been entered. _Equally, however, a Claimant cannot raise a new claim or a new way of putting the same claim in the proceedings to assess damages. … \[A\]t the trial to assess damages a defendant is entitled to raise all issues that are not inconsistent with the earlier determination of the issue of liability. …_

> 15    … _Obviously, the default judgment can only decide points that are pleaded in the Particulars of Claim. …_

> \[emphasis added\]

28     Shortly after parties tendered their written submissions for this matter, the Court of Appeal delivered its decision in _Toh Wee Ping Benjamin v Grande Corp Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 48</span> (“_Grande Corp_”), following which parties drew my attention to specific paragraphs that are relevant to this case.[^6] In _Grande Corp_, after the defendant’s defence was struck out, the Court had to consider what issues remained open to challenge at the assessment of damages hearing. The Court of Appeal held that the effect of failing to file a defence is that a defendant is deemed to have admitted to all allegations of fact in the statement of claim (at \[42\]), and what remained to be decided was the claimant had indeed suffered damage and the appropriate quantum of such damages (at \[47\]). Relying on this holding, the Plaintiff argued that _Grande Corp_ stands for the proposition that the Court can only consider the issue of damages at the assessment hearing.[^7] With respect, _Grande Corp_ does not go so far. The key point to note is that the statement of claim in _Grande Corp_ had raised issues of liability against the defendant. Naturally, the defendant was estopped from challenging those allegations. It was in those circumstances that the Court moved on to the issue of damages. Notably, _Grande Corp_ does not concern a case where the pleaded case fails to disclose allegations of liability against the defendant. Viewed in this light, the principles stated in _Grande Corp_ are consistent with my understanding of the law but the facts are distinguishable.

29     The two other cases cited by the Plaintiff reveal a fact pattern that is similar to _Grande Corp_, in that the claimant in both these cases had pleaded the essential facts required to ground the cause of action against the defendant. The first is the case of _Ho Yew Weng Alan James v Poh Eng Wah Mark t/a SG Vehicles Trading_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 179</span> (“_James Ho_”), which involved a claim to enforce a guarantee given by the defendant under a hire purchase agreement relating to a motorcar.[^8] Default interlocutory judgment was entered against the defendant and the matter proceeded for assessment of damages. At the assessment hearing, the defendant argued that the claimant had no cause action because the owner of the motorcar had not assigned the benefits of the guarantee to the claimant. In view of the default interlocutory judgment, which remained standing at the assessment of damages hearing, the Court disallowed the argument. What is crucial to note is that this argument contradicted the pleaded averment that the owner of the vehicle had assigned to the claimant “all its rights and interest under the hire purchase agreement” (at \[2\]). In my view, the assignment of all rights and interest under the hire purchase agreement necessarily gave the claimant the standing to bring the claim on the said agreement. That unchallenged averment made it incongruous to say that the “benefits” had not been assigned. As I have stated above, defendants are allowed to run arguments at the assessment of damages hearing where it does not run contrary to the pleaded case upon which the interlocutory judgment was issued, but in the case of _James Ho_, the defendant failed to satisfy this requirement. In this sense, _James Ho_ is consistent with the principles I have stated above.

30     The second case is _Cheng Fu Zay and another v The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 1919 (Scott Vickers Engineering Pte Ltd, Third Party)_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGDC 257</span> (“_Cheng Fu Zay_”).[^9] This case concerns an interlocutory judgment entered by consent. The Court in this case held that it was no longer open to the defendant to re-litigate the issue of liability at the assessment of damages. Once again, that was because the issue of liability was pleaded and the pleaded averments were resolved in favour of the claimant by consent (see \[22\] of _Cheng Fu Zay_). Since the defendant had consented to entering interlocutory judgment on that basis, the Court held that it was too late for the defendant to unwind the litigation clock on this issue.

31     In the present case, the Statement of Claim is devoid of any pleaded averment of liability against the Defendant. This defining feature is what distinguishes the present case from the run-of-the-mill cases discussed above. The Defendant could not have possibly admitted to an allegation of liability when none existed. Equally, the Interlocutory Judgment could not have determined an issue that did not arise from the pleadings. Since the issue of liability has not been determined, it remains open to the Defendant (and in turn the Insurer) to challenge the Plaintiff’s case on the same at the assessment of damages hearing, without having to set aside the Interlocutory Judgment. As a matter of principle, the Insurer is entitled to put the Plaintiff to strict proof of its pleaded case.

32     The outcome may well be different if the Plaintiff had pleaded an allegation of liability against the Defendant, which the Plaintiff could rely on to estop the Defendant from challenging the same without setting aside the Interlocutory Judgment. Ironically, the Statement of Claim in the _First Action_ actually contained allegations of liability against the Defendant. There, the Plaintiff pleaded, amongst others:

> … the Defendant’s motorcar failed to maintain a safe distance and collided into the rear of the Plaintiff’s motorcycle …

> The said collision was caused solely or contributed to by the negligence of _the Defendant_ in the driving, management and control of his motorcar.

> …

> By reason of the negligence of _the Defendant_, the Plaintiff has sustained injuries and endured pain and has been put to loss and expenses.”

> \[emphasis added\]

As it turned out, the decision to replace references to “the Defendant” (as indicated in italics) with “the driver of the Defendant’s motorcar” did the Plaintiff’s case more harm than good.

33     The Plaintiff argued that a ruling in favour of the Insurer would undermine the finality of interlocutory judgments and open the floodgates for insurers to challenge liability at the assessment hearing. [^10] In my judgment, this concern is overstated. As I have explained above, the right to challenge issues of liability does not arise _carte blanche_. It arises where the claimant fails to put liability into issue in its pleaded case. It follows from this that claimants can and should foreclose that right by pleading the essential ingredients required to establish liability before obtaining default interlocutory judgment, in which case the defendant’s recourse would be to set aside the default judgment.

34     Finally, the Plaintiff urged me to consider the fact that the Insurer, in its application for leave to intervene in this action, confined the scope of intervention to issues of quantum, and that necessarily means that the Insurer has no standing to contest issues of liability.[^11] The relevant portion of the Insurer’s supporting affidavit reads:

> As the \[Insurer\] may end up satisfying any final judgment obtained in this action in relation to personal injury pursuant to the provision of the \[MVA\] and/or MIB Agreement \[_sic_\], _they therefore wish to be heard on the issue of quantum in these proceedings_ as the Defendants have not engaged solicitors to act for them. The \[Insurer’s\] addition as interveners will ensure that they are duly heard and represented in relation to all the quantum in dispute as they are likely to be financially affected as a result of a decision in this suit.

> \[emphasis added\]

35     With respect, I am unable to agree with this submission. The Insurer is entitled to put the Plaintiff to strict proof of not just damage but _actionable damage_, without which the defendant is simply not liable. To quote Lord Hoffmann in _Harding v Wealands_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 AC 1</span> at \[24\], “the identification of actionable damage is an integral part of the rules which determine liability”. For the reasons I have stated above, a defendant may raise any issue in the assessment of damages hearing so long as that it does not contradict the issues determined in the interlocutory judgment. On the present facts, since the issue of liability was not resolved in the Interlocutory Judgment, it remains open to the Defendant to challenge it at the assessment of damages hearing. In any event, what is perhaps more important is that the order of court granting leave to intervene did not impose any restrictions on the issues that the Insurer is allowed to raise. This means that the Insurer is entitled to raise all issues that would have a bearing on its interest. Certainly, whether the Plaintiff has established actionable damage, for which it is liable to compensate pursuant to the MVA, is one such issue.

36     In these premises, I find that it remains open to the Defendant, and in turn the Insurer, to disclaim liability at the assessment of damages hearing, without having to set aside Interlocutory Judgment.

## Does the Statement of Claim disclose a reasonable cause of action?

37     I turn now to assess whether the Statement of Claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against the Defendant. It is axiomatic that the Plaintiff bears the burden of proving its case (_Cheong Ghim Fah v Murugian s/o Rangasamy_ \[2004\] 1 SLR(R) at \[30\]). The Defendant is entitled to put the Plaintiff to strict proof, without having to respond to the allegations made (_Lim Swee Khiang v Borden Co Pte Ltd_ \[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 745 at \[5\]). As mentioned above, the pleaded case asserts that the hirer (and not the Defendant) negligently caused the accident and damages. None of the pleadings asserts any liability against the Defendant, whether vicariously, by agency or otherwise.

38     The pleaded case did assert that the Defendant was the registered owner of the vehicle driven by the hirer. But that alone is not enough to trigger liability. Ownership of a vehicle, by itself, does not make the owner liable for the driver’s negligence (_Harry Rambarran v Gurrucharran_ <span class="citation">\[1970\] 1 WLR 556</span>). To affix “vicarious liability” on the owner, the claimant must show that the driver was using the car for the owner’s purposes, under delegation of a task or duty (_Morgans v Launchbury_ <span class="citation">\[1973\] AC 127</span> (“_Morgans_”) at 135, _per_ Lord Wilberforce). This quintessential touchstone for imposing liability on the owner is ostensibly absent in a typical car rental transaction. In _Avis Rent-A-Car Ltd v Maitland_ (1980) 32 WIR 294 (“_Avis_”), the Court of Appeal of Jamaica found that the owner of the rental car was not “vicariously liable” for the hirer’s negligence. The Court explained that, when an individual hires a vehicle from a car rental company, the vehicle can be driven by the hirer for “purposes exclusively determined by the hirer, in which benefits of the venture accrue wholly to the hirer”. There is “no joint interest between the owner and the hirer in the outcome of the venture and the hirer is not dependent upon or affected by the profitability or otherwise of the venture” (at 298). _Avis_ was followed in the case of _Brown v Levon_ \[2015\] SC (Bda) 20 Civ, where the Supreme Court of Bermuda found that the owner of a taxi was not “vicariously liable” for the driver’s negligence.

39     I am in broad agreement with the principles stated in _Morgans_ and _Avis_, with the caveat that the law has since the decision of _Morgans_ moved on to develop a different litmus test for vicarious liability. The recent Court of Appeal decision of _Ng Huat Seng and another v Munib Mohammad Madni and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1074</span> (“_Ng Huat Seng_”) represents the current state of the law, which entails a two-stage inquiry. The first stage examines the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the tortfeasor (_Ng Huat Seng_ at \[42\]). While the vicarious liability can be imposed outside employment relationships, it remains necessary to establish a relationship that is closely analogous to that and the central consideration is that it must be fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for the tortious acts of another. The second stage examines whether the defendant, by virtue of its relationship with the defendant, created or significantly enhanced the risk of the tort being committed (_Ng Huat Seng_ at \[66\]). In the present case, neither inquiry supports the imposition of vicarious liability. The bailment relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant arose from an arms’ length commercial transaction, hardly analogous to an employment relationship. Both parties had independent objectives in entering into this transaction – the Defendant presumably to profit from the rental and the Plaintiff presumably to drive for his own purposes. The hirer’s negligent driving stemmed from his own actions, rather than the lease agreement itself. In these circumstances, there is nothing fair, just or reasonable in making the Defendant liable for the hirer’s negligence.

40     That said, the analysis in _Morgans_ and _Avis_ remains relevant to the modern law of agency. Indeed, in _Morgans_, while the House of Lords used the term “vicarious liability”, the substantive inquiry focussed on whether the driver had driven the vehicle as an agent of the owner (see _Morgans_ at 135, 138-140, 144, 148-149). Similarly, in _Avis_, the Court expressed that “the only issue” was “whether the driver of the car could be said to be the agent of the \[owner\]” (at 296). In the modern context, an agency arises when one person (a ‘principal’) manifests assent to another person (an ‘agent’) that the agent shall act on the principal’s behalf and subject to the principal’s control, and the agent consents to the same (see Tan Cheng Han SC, _The Law of Agency_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) at para 01.006). On this definition, the car rental transaction in _Avis_ – or in the present case for that matter – clearly does not give rise to an agency relationship. The hirer rented and drove the vehicle for his own purposes and was not subject to the company’s control as to how and where the vehicle was to be driven.

41     In a bid to overcome these legal and factual difficulties, the Plaintiff sought to fall back on the doctrine of _res ipsa loquitur_.[^12] The doctrine is a “rule of evidence” that enables the claimant to establish a _prima facie_ case of negligence where there is insufficient direct evidence to prove the cause of accident (_Grace Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd v Te Deum Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 76</span> (“_Grace Electrical Engineering_”) at \[39\]). In _Grace Electrical Engineering_, the Court of Appeal held that for the doctrine to apply, three requirements must be satisfied (at \[39\]):

> (a)     the defendant must have been in control of the situation or thing which resulted in the accident;

> (b)     the accident would not have happened, in the ordinary course of things, if proper care had been taken; and

> (c)     the cause of the accident must be unknown.

42     In the present case, it is clear to me that none of the three requirements are satisfied. The Defendant had no control over how its hirer had driven the vehicle. Nor did the Plaintiff assert that the Defendant could have done more to prevent the accident. Most importantly, the fact that the cause of the present accident is actually known makes it utterly meaningless to resort to the doctrine (see _BNJ v SMRT Trains Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 7</span> at \[138\]-\[140\]). In this regard, it is undisputed that the negligent driving of the Defendant’s hirer was the cause of the accident. Since there are no evidential gaps to fill in the course of finding out how the accident had occurred, the doctrine has no room to operate. The factual matrix forecloses the Plaintiff from invoking the doctrine. The Plaintiff’s reliance on the doctrine is therefore wholly misplaced.

43     In these premises, the Plaintiff failed to establish a reasonable cause of action against the Defendant. Accordingly, I would have awarded no damages in any event.

## Conclusion

44     In conclusion, the Plaintiff’s claim fails on two grounds. First, the initiation of the present action violates of s 35 of the State Courts Act, thereby rendering the entire action a nullity _ab initio_. Second, even if the action were valid, the Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action against the Defendant. I will hear parties separately on the issue of costs.

45     It remains for me to thank parties for their written submissions and legal research. The materials tendered to the Court provided considerable assistance to my deliberation of the matter.
