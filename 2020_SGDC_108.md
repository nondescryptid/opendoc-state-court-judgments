### District Judge Sarah Tan:

1       The Accused, Muhammad Haikal Bin Suhairuddin, pleaded guilty to two charges:

> (the “Section 64 Road Traffic Act offence”).

2       I sentenced the Accused to the following individual sentences:

3       Pursuant to section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), I ordered the Accused to pay compensation of $907.90 for DAC-906070-2019, in default to serve three day’s imprisonment.

4       The Accused has appealed against his sentence. I now give my grounds of decision.

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

5       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The accused is Muhammad Haikal bin Suhairuddin, a 23-year-old male Singaporean bearing NRIC number [x].</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>FACTS RELATING TO THE 1</b> <sup>ST</sup> <b>CHARGE</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 At the material time, the accused was the rider of a Honda Wave motorcycle bearing registration number FX[x].

I AM ON THE MOVE.PLEASE CALL ME. MY EYES ARE BLEEDING. I CAN’T SEE THE VEHICLE NUMBER OF HIS MOTORBIKE. I AM ON THE TPE NOW”. The incident location provided was the Tampines Expressway towards Changi after Punggol Road, Singapore.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Facts relating to the charge</em></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 On 13 November 2017, at about 10.55pm, the victim stopped his car at the junction before Sengkang East Avenue on the right-turn lane, as the traffic light signal was red. When the traffic light signal turned green in his favour and the victim’s car was moving off, the accused’s motorcycle cut in front of the victim’s car. The accused proceeded on the furthest right lane ahead of the victim’s car. The victim felt that the accused was riding too slowly and flashed his high beam at the accused. The victim then signalled and moved out to the left lane to overtake the accused’s motorcycle, just as the accused also signalled to move into the left lane. As a result, both vehicles swerved and narrowly avoided each other, with the victim’s car eventually overtaking the accused’s motorcycle. The accused was unhappy with the victim’s manner of driving and tried to catch up with the victim’s car to confront the victim.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 Later that same night, at about 10.58pm, the accused sounded his horn at the victim and signalled for him to stop on the side of the road. Both vehicles came to a stop at the side of the Punggol Field, Singapore, with the victim’s car parked in front of the accused’s motorcycle. The accused and the victim alighted from their vehicles, whilst the accused’s girlfriend remained on the motorcycle. The accused and the victim began arguing with each other over their manner of driving earlier that night.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 In the course of the argument, the accused pushed the victim twice on his chest, causing the victim to stumble a few steps backwards. When the victim tried to walk back to his car, the accused grabbed the victim by his collar and punched him once on his left eye.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 The accused then got onto his motorcycle and rode away in the direction of Changi Airport, Singapore. The victim tried to follow the accused but eventually lost sight of the accused in the vicinity of Block 603 Elias Road, Singapore. The victim then called the Police.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9 As a result of the accused’s punch, the victim sustained a laceration above his left eyebrow, periorbital swelling and infra-orbital numbness. When the victim was seen at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital for treatment on 14 November 2017, X-rays showed soft tissue swelling in the orbital region and a CT scan of his orbits showed an inferior wall blow-out fracture with a small extra-conal haematoma along the fracture. The victim was discharged against advice with referral for a follow-up appointment and given three days of medical leave.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 To date, the victim has incurred costs of S$907.90 for his medical treatment.

## PRESCRIBED PUNISHMENT

6       For the Section 325 Penal Code offence, the Accused is subject to imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

7       For a first conviction under Section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act, the Accused is subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

8       Section 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act also states: “A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.”

## ANTECEDENTS

9       The Accused is untraced.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS

10     The Prosecution submitted on a sentence of at least 5 months for the Section 325 Penal Code offence.

11     With the aid of a table of sentencing precedents, the Prosecution illustrated that for cases involving the injury of an orbital fracture by way of a single punch or kick, the sentences ranged from 3 months’ to 2 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

12     The Prosecution highlighted that this case was one of “road rage”: parties had been unhappy about the way that the other was driving and in the confrontation, the Accused punched the Victim in the eye.

13     For the Section 64 Road Traffic Act offence, the Prosecution sought (merely) a fine and a disqualification order (“DQ”), leaving such quantum and duration to the court, the DQ to start after serving the imprisonment term for the Section 325 Penal Code offence.

## DEFENCE COUNSEL’S SUBMISSIONS AND MITIGATION

14     The Defence Counsel tendered his written submissions.

15     The Defence Counsel conceded that the Section 325 Penal Code offence was one of road rage. He sought to distinguish the case of **_PP v Ronald Teo Cheng Huat_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 395</span> (“**_Ronald Teo_**”) listed in the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents:

> (a)     Ronald Teo punched twice while the Accused punched once.

> (b)     Ronald Teo claimed trial while the Accused pleaded guilty.

> (c)     Ronald Teo’s victim suffered only facial lacerations but taking into account the totality of injuries, was given medical leave of 44 days. The Victim had only three days of medical leave.

> (d)     Ronald Teo had persisted against his victim despite witnesses stepping in.

16     The Defence Counsel also indicated that while the Accused had not made any compensation to the Victim, they are not resisting any compensation orders sought by the Prosecution, and the Accused would be _willing_ to pay such compensation upon the order being made. The Defence Counsel asked for this _willingness_ to pay to be taken in mitigation.

17     I noted that a _willingness_ to pay the compensation under the Court’s compensation order upon it being made is no guarantee that it indeed _will be_ paid, hence I queried the Defence Counsel on how such _mere expression of willingness_ to pay compensation can be mitigating, inviting his further submssions. The Defence Counsel was not able to put forth any authorities/material before the Court and did not press this point further.

18     The Defence Counsel expressed the Accused’s gratitude that the Prosecution was not seeking any custodial sentence in respect of the Section 64 Road Traffic Act offence. The Defence Counsel did not submit on the appropriate quantum for the fine. He merely submitted that the Accused was facing financial difficulties and sought for the fine to be paid by instalments. He also sought a short in default sentence of imprisonment.

## PROSECUTION’S REPLY

19     The Prosecution argued that the Accused had not made any voluntary compensation, and his indication (only) now that he was willing to pay (and not actually having paid), could not be mitigating.

20     The Prosecution sought to distinguish the case of **_Ronald Teo_**, pointing out that the victim in **_Ronald Teo_** sustained a fracture to his fifth metacarpal bone, in the hand. In our present case, the Victim was hit in the face, which is a vulnerable part of the body. Even before grabbing the Victim’s collar and punching him in the eye, the Accused had actually pushed the Victim hard enough for the Victim to stumble backwards. The Prosecution concluded that 5 months’ imprisonment would be in line with the precedent cases.

21     To the Accused’s credit, he pleaded guilty and had no antecedents. However, it is trite law that financial hardship is mitigating only in the most exceptional of circumstances.

22     I will now discuss the individual sentences and the compensation.

## MY SENTENCE: THE SECTION 325 PENAL CODE OFFENCE’S IMPRISONMENT

### PP v Ronald Teo Cheng Huat

23     In **_Ronald Teo_**, Ronald Teo had claimed trial. Ronald Teo punched the victim once, leading to a laceration under the right eye. Ronald Teo then threw a second punch, which the victim blocked with his right hand, leading to a _fracture_ of his right 5th metacarpal _in the hand_.

24     In our present case, as a result of the Accused’s punch, the Victim sustained _not only_ a laceration above his left eyebrow (similar to Ronald Teo’s laceration under the right eye), _but also more serious injuries to his eye_: periorbital swelling and infra-orbital numbness, and more alarmingly, soft tissue swelling in the orbital region and an inferior wall blow-out fracture with a small extra-conal haematoma along the fracture.

25     Whilst the Victim was given three days of medical leave (compared to **_Ronald Teo’s_** 44 days of medical leave), as pointed out earlier there are some key differences in the nature and location of the injuries involved. I also noted from the Statement of Facts that the Victim had been discharged against advice.

26     The Victim sustained the _fracture to the bone around the eye_. The Accused had targeted the Victim’s face, a _vulnerable part_ of the body, leading to the fracture. Indeed, the Accused had hit the Victim around the eye, one of our sensory organs.

27     I studied also the circumstances of the incident. The Statement of Facts disclosed that when both the Accused’s motorcycle and the Victim’s car tried to move into the same lane on the left, they swerved and narrowly avoided each other, with the Victim’s car eventually overtaking the Accused’s motorcycle. Notwithstanding the Victim’s car was _already_ ahead, the Accused was unhappy with the Victim’s manner of driving and tried to catch up with the Victim’s car to confront the Victim.

28     The Accused _did not let the matter rest. Even though he was the one who first cut in to the front of the Victim’s car_ at the junction before Sengkang East Avenue, he saw it fit to find fault with the Victim’s manner of driving and sought to extract his pound of flesh.

29     The Accused was _persistent_ in his pursuit. _Three minutes later_ (at 10.58 pm), the Accused sounded his horn at the Victim and signalled for him to stop at the side of the road.

30     After the Accused and Victim alighted from their respective vehicles, they started arguing. I noted from the Defence Counsel’s mitigation plea that the Victim had “shoved and body checked (chest to chest) the Accused whilst spouting vulgarities at him”. At the same time, I noted also that the Accused had pushed the victim twice on his chest, with a force strong enough to cause the Victim to stumble a few steps backwards.

31     However, the situation escalated when the Accused was _unrelenting_ and did not let up in his confrontation of the Victim: even as the Victim tried to walk back to his car, the Accused grabbed the Victim by the collar and punched him once on his left eye.

32     As such, an uplift from **_Ronald Teo’s_** 3 months’ imprisonment would be warranted.

### Lim Hong Hiang v PP

33     Indeed, I did find similarities between our present case and the case of **_Lim Hong Hiang v PP_** (MA 314/96/01) (“**_Lim Hong Hiang_**”). Lim Hong Hiang and his co-accused had a dispute with the victim over the victim’s winnings from betting on a soccer match. Lim Hong Hiang _punched the victim in the region between his nose and left eye_. The victim squatted down and used his hands to cover his face. Then the co-accused rushed over and hit the victim all over his body. The victim suffered a fracture of the floor of the left orbital and a suspected fracture of the medial wall of the left maxillary antrum. He also had a left periorbital haematoma and bruises over his right chest. Lim Hong Hiang, who was _untraced_, _claimed trial_. He was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment.

34     Unlike the Accused who pleaded guilty, Lim Hong Hiang had claimed trial and ordinarily would not benefit from the mitigating weight of a timely plea of guilt. Further, **_Lim Hong Hiang_** may be considered slightly more aggravated than our present case, with the participation of a co-accused hitting the victim all over his body.

35     That being said, **_Lim Hong Hiang_** was not a case of “road rage”. I noted also that the sentencing spectrum was narrower then, with the imprisonment term subject to a _maximum of 7 years_, and within this spectrum, Lim Hong Hiang was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment. Since then, the sentencing spectrum that we are presently subjected to is a _maximum of 10 years for imprisonment_.

36     As such, a 5 months’ imprisonment term for the Accused would not be out of line with the sentence in **_Lim Hong Hiang_**.

### PP v Ng Peng Soon

37     Further, I also found the case of **_PP v Ng Peng Soon_** (“**_Ng Peng Soon_**”) <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 228</span> useful in framing the appropriate sentence for our present case.

38     Ng Peng Soon attacked 2 patrons at a disco:

> (a)     1st victim: Ng Peng Soon struck the 1st victim’s face with a drinking glass and the 1st victim sustained extensive facial scarring.

> (b)     2nd victim: Ng Peng Soon punched the 2nd victim once on his face. The 2nd victim sustained a two-part fracture of his nasal bone.

39     Ng Peng Soon claimed trial. He had a similar antecedent in 1983 and other unrelated antecedents. He was sentenced to 1 year’s imprisonment for the attack against the 2nd victim.

40     Taking into account **_Ng Peng Soon’s_** related antecedent (which is arguably rather dated) and fact of claiming trial, to sentence the Accused to 5 months’ imprisonment would not be manifestly excessive in the context of **_Ng Peng Soon’s_** 1 year’s imprisonment for the offence against the 2nd victim.

41     I turn now to the other cases highlighted by the parties, involving one or two blows to the face and resulting in fracture:

> (a)     (i) In **_PP v Chang Yam Song_** <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 142</span> (“**_Chang Yam Song_**”), Chang Yam Song (_traced for unrelated offences_) and the victim had an altercation over a debt owed by the former. Chang Yam Song punched the victim _once on his nose_, causing a _nasal bone fracture_. Chang Yam Song _claimed trial_. He was found to have cast aspersions and baseless allegations against the victim, including suggesting that the victim had self-inflicted the injuries. At that time, the _maximum imprisonment term_ was only 7 years, and Chang Yam Song was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

> (ii)     I noted that Chang Yam Song had claimed trial and ordinarily would not benefit from the mitigating weight of a timely plea of guilt. That being said, **_Chang Yam Song_** was not a case of “road rage”. I also noted that the sentencing spectrum was narrower then, with the imprisonment term subject to a _maximum of 7 years_, and within this spectrum, Chang Yam Song was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment. Since then, the sentencing spectrum that we are presently subjected to is a _maximum of 10 years for imprisonment_.

> (b)     (i) In **_Tan Xian Wen Denny v PP_** (MA 9042/2014} (“**_Tan Xian Wen Denny_**”), Tan Xian Wen Denny made fun of the name of a new acquaintance and _punched his face_ as the latter was walking out of the lift. Others tried to hold Tan Xian Wen Denny back but he charged towards the victim and _punched him a second time_ in the face. The victim suffered a _displaced nasal bone open fracture and nose laceration_. The victim had to undergo a septorhinoplasty to correct the bone injuries which were causing nasal obstruction. Tan Xian Wen Denny _pleaded guilty_; he was _traced for unrelated antecedents_. He was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

> (ii)     I noted that to the credit of Tan Xian Wen Denny, he had paid $15,000 compensation to his victim by way of a _Deed of Settlement_, largely settling the victim’s civil claim of $25,000. Further, this was not a case of “road rage”.

> (c)     (i) In **_PP v Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor_** (DAC-921436-2015) (“**_Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor_**”), Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor and victim were driving along Bukit Batok Road when the former honked at the latter and gestured for him to stop. They alighted and had a conversation. Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor then took out his mobile phone to take a photograph of the victim and the victim stretched out his hand to block. Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor then _punched the victim once on his face_. The victim sustained _a blowout fracture of the medial orbital wall and mildly displaced fractures of the nasal bone_. After the victim fell down, Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor stamped the victim’s right leg multiple times and caused the victim to sustain a small fracture of his shin bone. The victim did not require any surgery for his injuries, and was not permanently incapacitated. Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor, who was _untraced_, _pleaded guilty_ and was sentenced to 7 months’ imprisonment.

> (ii)     I recognized that Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor was more culpable than Accused and the injuries more extensive, for Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor had stamped the victim’s leg while the victim was on the ground in addition to punching him on the face. As such, I recognized that the sentence I meted out to the Accused would have to be to be calibrated downwards from the 7 months’ imprisonment meted out to Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor.

42     At this juncture, I would say that a sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment in respect of the Accused’s Section 325 Penal Code offence would not be discordant with the sentences in **_Chang Yam Song_**, **_Tan Xian Wen Denny_** and **_Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor_**.

43     For the sake of completeness, I will add that the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents included two other cases illustrating the sentences for Section 325 Penal Code offences: **_PP v Samson Tanuwidjaja & Or Appeal_** (“**_Samson Tanuwidjaja_**”) (MA 9102/2018/01-02) (claimed trial, traced for unrelated offences, 9 months’ imprisonment) and **_PP v Ho Soo Kok_** (“**_Ho Soo Kok_**”) <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGDC 134</span> (pleaded guilty, untraced, 2 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane).

44     These two cases attracted a higher range of sentences given the multiple blows and/or more extensive injuries:

> (a)     In **_Samson Tanuwidjaja_**, the victim was dealt multiple blows and suffered a 2cm bruise on forehead, 2cm swelling on right cheek, 1cm laceration on right parietal region, and a displaced fracture of the tip of her nasal bone.

> (b)     In **_Ho Soo Kok_**, Ho Soo Kok attacked his ex-girlfriend’s current boyfriend. He punched the victim in the face and after the victim fell to the ground, he continued to punch the victim in the face until he was stopped by passers-by.

45     Suffice to say I recognised that given the nature of the attack and the nature and extent of injuries in our case, the sentence meted out to the Accused would have to be calibrated downwards from **_Samson Tanuwidjaja’s_** 9 months’ imprisonment and **_Ho Soo Kok’s_** 2 years’ imprisonment (and 6 strokes of the cane).

46     In his Mitigation Plea, the Defence Counsel submitted that “the rigours of a prison environment may affect \[the Accused’s\] unstable psychiatric condition”. He stated that the Accused suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder which required a referral to the psychologist or psychiatrist for further management.

47     Firstly, I noted that the medical report dated 11 September 2019 from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (which had no name or signature of the writer) disclosed that the Accused was initially admitted to Changi General Hospital following an assault, and was subsequently transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 10 December 2017. I wish to point out that it was not canvassed before me that this “assault” was in respect of the same incident on 13 November 2017 that gave rise to the Section 325 Penal Code offence. Indeed, the Defence Counsel had not argued that the Victim had caused the Accused to suffer any ruptured berry aneurysm or other injuries.

48     Further, I noted that this Medical Report shed little light on the nature and extent of the Accused’s alleged psychiatric condition, how unstable the Accused’s psychiatric condition allegedly was, and how the prison environment would affect it. In fact, the Medical Report merely stated that the Accused displayed some symptoms of _possible_ post-traumatic stress disorder, and urged that “a medical report \[should be requested\] from the psychologist and/or psychiatrist if further information is required”.

49     Secondly, I noted that the medical certificates from the SAF merely stated that “sick leave” was prescribed.

50     Thirdly, I noted that the SMS reminders from Tan Tock Seng Hospital revealed nothing more than appointments being scheduled or rescheduled.

## MY SENTENCE: SECTION 64 ROAD TRAFFIC ACT OFFENCE’S FINE AND DISQUALIFICATION

51     The Defence Counsel did not submit on the quantum of the fine.

52     The Defence Counsel conceded that for Section 64 Road Traffic Act offences, DQ would normally be imposed.

53     The Defence Counsel highlighted the case of **PP v** **_Koh Thiam Huat_** <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span>, where an 18 months’ DQ was imposed as the victim’s injuries were severe: multiple injuries including traumatic head injuries such as a comminuted undisplaced fracture of the skull vault in the left parieto-temporal region extending to the temporal bone. I noted that the victim was warded for seven days and given hospitalisation leave of 42 days. Koh Thiam Huat had also committed many traffic offences.

54     The Defence Counsel submitted that the DQ imposed on the Accused should be less than the 18 months meted out in _Koh Thiam Huat_. He further submitted that the DQ imposed on the Accused should in fact be for a period of less than 12 months.

55     When probed as to why the DQ should be less than 12 months in particular, and not, say, less than 15 months, the Defence Counsel’s response was _simply because_ a DQ period of 12 months or more would trigger the revocation of the Accused’s driving license. The Defence Counsel did not further substantiate his submissions with any precedents, or any other substantive arguments.

56     The Prosecution argued that the DQ should be of at least 12 months. She further highlighted that the Accused had previously compounded offences in 2017 for speeding and failing to conform to red light.

57     I accepted the Defence Counsel’s submission that the _level of harm_ in our present case was lower.

58     However, the Accused’s _driving records were not pristine_. The Accused’s previous compositions were factors to which I could accord the relevant weight.

59     I noted that the Accused’s _previous compositions for speeding and failing to confirm to red light were in 2017_, which were fairly recent considering the Section 64 Road Traffic Act offence took place in August 2018.

60     The _gravamen_ of the Section 64 Road Traffic Act offence was essentially the disobedience of a red light, _markedly similar_ to the wrongdoing behind the composition the Accused had in 2017 for failing to conform to red light. The Statement of Facts stated that although the traffic light signal was red against the Accused, he entered the junction and collided with the involved party, who was executing a right turn with the green arrow in his favour.

61     As someone who was on the roads often for his job, it was of concern that despite the composition in 2017, the Accused had not improved his driving habits, to make the roads safer for himself and other road users.

62     In the premises, I was of the view that a fine of $900 and a DQ of 12 months would be warranted.

## MY ORDER: COMPENSATION

63     The Statement of Facts indicated that the Victim incurred $907.90 for his medical expenses and that no compensation had been made. The Prosecution submitted that a compensation order ought to be made against the Accused for this amount.

64     The medical expenses of $907.90 were supported by tax invoices from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital:

65     This aspect of compensation was not contentious, as the Defence Counsel indicated during Mitigation and Submissions that the Accused would be agreeable to pay the compensation of $907.90.

66     Pursuant to section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code, I ordered the Accused to pay compensation of $907.90 for DAC-906070-2019 in favour of the Victim, in default to serve 3 day’s imprisonment.

67     The in default imprisonment term cannot be said to be excessive, when contrasted with other cases:

> (a)     In **_Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Sukor_**: for the compensation amount of $200, the in default imprisonment term was 2 days.

> (b)     In **_Lim Peng Hiang_**: for the compensation amount of $750, the in default imprisonment term was 3 weeks.

## SENTENCES NOT EXCESSIVE

68     All factors considered, and given the spectrum of the prescribed punishment, the sentences cannot be said to be excessive, much less manifestly excessive:

> (a)     For the Section 325 Penal Code offence: maximum 10 years’ imprisonment, an imprisonment term of 5 months cannot be said to be manifestly excessive.

> (b)     For the Section 64 Road Traffic Act offence: maximum $5000 fine or maximum 12 months’ imprisonment or both, a fine of $900 cannot be said to be manifestly excessive.

## THE REQUEST FOR MORE TIME AND THE DEFERMENT OF SENTENCE

69     At the outset of the court session, the Defence Counsel, on behalf of the Accused, _sought an adjournment of the plead guilty mention_ for _one month_. The Defence Counsel explained that the Accused needed time to settle his finances like the road tax pertaining to his vehicle, his insurance policies and his motorbike re-inspection dates. The Accused not want the the DQ to start on that day as that would hamper him in tending to the road tax matters as he needs to send his motorbike for inspection.

70     The Defence Counsel also added that the Accused was in active National Service and given that SAF intended to discharge him from active national service, the Accused needed some time to sort out his issue of the early discharge with Mindef.

71     The Prosecution objected to any adjournment and proposed that plea be proceeded with that day, with perhaps the sentence being deferred.

72     Given that matter had been long outstanding for more than one year (the first mention was at Court 26 of the old State Courts Building on 27 May 2019), I was not minded to adjourn the matter any further with cogent justifications.

73     After conferring with the Accused, the Defence Counsel informed that the Accused would be prepared to have his plea taken on that day, with sentence to be deferred to a date after 30 April 2020.

74     As such, after I pronounced my sentence, and with the bailor’s consent, I allowed a deferment of the sentence. I ordered that the Accused was to **surrender on 4 May 2020**. In tandem with this, the **fine of $900 and the compensation of $907.90 were to be paid by 4 May 2020**.

## CONCLUSION

75     The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence, has filed this appeal during the period of the deferment. He is due to surrender to court on 4 May 2020.
