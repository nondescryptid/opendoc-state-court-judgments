2 December 2019

### District Judge Toh Han Li :

1       This is an appeal by the accused against sentence.

## The charge

2       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> _MAC-907454-2019_

> _You are charged that you on the 8_ th _day of November 2018, at about 6.50 am, on board bus service number 167 while it was travelling along Thomson Road near bus stop number 50059, Singapore, did use criminal force on one xxx (“victim”), female 20 years old, intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, by touching her right breast once over her clothes, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## Statement of Facts

3       The accused is Kochadai Baskaran, a 42 year old male Indian National. He was working as a construction worker at the material time.

4       The victim is 20 year old female.

5       On 8 November 2018 at about 7.07 a.m., the victim called the Police informing, “_I got molested inside the bus. I went down here to chase after the guy who got down at here. He went towards the overhead bridge towards the medical centre.”_ The call was made from the bus stop opposite Thomson Medical Centre located at 339 Thomson Road, Singapore 307677.

6       On 8 November 2018 at about 6.00 a.m., the victim boarded bus service number 167 from Sembawang. The victim took a seat at the extreme left seat at the back row of the bus. The victim fell asleep. The accused boarded the bus at about 6.30am and took a seat next to the victim, on her right. During the bus journey, the accused felt the victim’s shoulder brush against his shoulder. As the victim’s shoulder brushed against his own, the accused felt excited and wanted to touch her. At or about 6.50am, the accused, intending to outrage the modesty of the said victim, used his right hand to reach over to the victim, and touched her right breast over her clothing. The victim felt the touch and woke up. She saw the accused touching her breast and confronted him by saying “what are you doing?” The accused quickly alighted from the bus at the next bus stop, which was bus stop number 50059 located opposite Thomson Medical Centre, and the victim followed him.

7       After alighting from the bus, the victim caught up with the accused and gave him a push. The accused noticed that the victim was very angry and he was worried that the matter would escalate. He then ran up the overhead bridge located near the bus stop and fled from the victim. The victim tried to run after the accused but could not catch up. The victim made a search around the vicinity but did not manage to locate the accused. After which, the victim called the police for assistance as she felt outraged by the accused’s actions. Through subsequent follow up by the police, the accused was found and placed under arrest.

## Antecedents

8       The accused is a first offender.

## Prosecutions submission on sentence

9       The prosecution submitted that the victim’s breasts had been intruded on public transport albeit with no skin to skin contact. Furthermore, there were attempts by the accused to evade detection. It submitted that whatever compensation which was offered subsequently by the accused was irrelevant and the offer to compound the offence had been rejected by the victim.

10     The prosecution submitted that the case fell within the lower end of Band 2 of Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“Kunasekaran’s case”) and asked for a sentence of not less than 5 months imprisonment. It also relied on the following sentencing precedents:

11      **PP v Andy Yung Sie Hau, MAC 911196-2017**. The 22 year old accused, was at a bus-stop with the victim. The victim felt someone bumped her on the lower back as she was waiting at the busstop, which caused her to move slightly forward. She then felt the accused squeezing the upper part of her left breast with his hand. She shouted for help and saw the accused running away wearing a surgical mask. The accused was traced with CCTV assistance. The accused had initially seen another female Chinese on board a bus and decided to follow her after alighting from the bus. He followed this lady to her block before walking back to his own block. He then saw the victim sitting alone at the bus-stop and thought of touching her. He donned the surgical mask to avoid being recognised, ran towards her and molested her before running away. He was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment.

12      **PP v Kundu Pronoy Kumar, MAC 901453-2018**. The 39 year old accused had gone to the MRT station toilet. While he was inside, the victim came by and wanted to enter to clean it but saw people inside. She then placed a cone and cleaning equipment outside the toilet and waited for everyone to leave the toilet. The accused smiled at her and was the last person to leave. As the accused walked out of the toilet he tried to talk to the victim in English but she could not understand him. He then gave her a piece of paper with his handphone number on it. Not knowing what it was for the victim simply took the paper and pocketed it. She then entered the toilet with her cleaning equipment. As she was mopping the accused re-entered the toilet, walked up to the victim, placed his hand on her left shoulder and kissed her left cheek once. He then hugged her from behind and grabbed her breast intending to outrage her modesty. The victim asked the accused 'Why?' in Malay. The accused then left the toilet. He was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

13      **PP v Muhammad Syihabuddin, MAC 906631-2017**. The victim was in her school uniform and was sitting at a concrete ledge eating when she noticed the 26 year old accused looking at her. Feeling uneasy she moved to sit at a nearby bus-stop. The accused joined her and sat next to her on her left. The victim did not dare to look at him and looked at her mobile phone. Suddenly, she felt the accused lean towards her with his right hand going around her back while using his left hand to grope her left breast over her clothing, intending to outrage her modesty. The victim screamed and shifted away. The accused stood up, grinned at her and strolled away. He was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment.

## Mitigation

14     In mitigation, defence counsel highlighted the following salient background facts:

15     The accused is an Indian national and has been working in Singapore for more than 10 years. He has been employed as a safety supervisor with Bros Build Engineering since 2013 and is the sole breadwinner of the family since he was 15 years old when his father passed away. He has two children, a boy aged 11 and a girl aged 10. He received a testimonial from his employer stating that he has always shown exemplary character, is a hardworking employee and has always been helpful and conscientious. He is a blood donor and volunteers at various temples under the Hindu Endowment Board. This is his first brush with the law.

16     With regard to the offence, the defence raised the following points:

17     The accused has pleaded guilty and was deeply contrite and remorseful for his act which is totally out of character. The accused had met with the Investigating Officer and handed her an apology letter to be given to the victim and a sum of $1,000 compensation to the victim which she had received.

18     The defence accepted that the incident happened on public transport which is an aggravating factor. Nonetheless, it submitted that the present case fell within Band 1 of Kunasekaran’s case. The defence highlighted that the breast was touched over her clothing, there was no skin to skin contact and the touch was fleeting.

19     The defence submitted two newspapers articles from the Straits Times dated 27 September 2019 and the New Paper dated 26 June 2019 where fines were imposed on the accused even though the acts of molest appeared to be premeditated and more egregious. The defence accordingly asked for a fine of between $3,000 and $5,000 to imposed on the accused.

## Sentencing principles

20     In Kunasekaran’s case, Chan Seng Onn J adopted for use in s 354(1) Penal Code cases See Kee Oon J’s two-step sentencing framework for s 354(2) Penal Code cases in GBR v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> as follows:

21     Under the “two-step sentencing bands” approach, sentencing for offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code for outrage of modesty _simpliciter_ would thus take place in two steps. First, the court would consider the following offence specific factors: (a) the degree of sexual exploitation; (b) the circumstances of the offence; and (c) the harm caused to the victim.

22     Based on the consideration of the foregoing offence-specific factors, the court should ascertain the gravity of the offence and then place the offence within any of the following three bands of imprisonment:

> Band 1: This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts. The sentence to be imposed would be less than five months’ imprisonment.

> Band 2: This includes cases where two or more of the offence-specific factors present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception. The sentence to be imposed would be five to 15 months’ imprisonment.

> Band 3: This includes cases where numerous offence specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim. The sentence to be imposed would be 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment.

23     At the second step, the court would consider the aggravating and mitigating factors that related to the offender generally but which were not offence-specific (_ie_, offender-specific factors).

## Offence specific factors

24     Applying the Kunasekaran framework, I first considered the relevant offence-specific factors.

#### Degree of sexual exploitation

25     In the present case, the accused had touched the victim’s breast albeit over her clothes. I consider this as intruding upon the private parts of the victim even if there was no skin to skin contact.

#### Place of the offence

26     The present offence took place on board a public transport vehicle. In Kunasekaran’s case, Chan J observed “the growing need for the courts to deter offenders from committing outrage of modesty cases on public transport has been highlighted on multiple occasions in Parliament \[at para 58\].”

27     The defence concedes that this as an aggravating factor.

#### Harm caused to the victim and attempt to flee

28     While the Prosecution did not submit a victim impact statement detailing the exact harm suffered by the victim, the Statement of Facts did reflect the victim’s anger upon being molested as well as the accused’s attempt to flee the scene.

> “After alighting from the bus, **the victim caught up with the accused and gave him a push**. **The accused noticed that the victim was very angry** and he was worried that the matter would escalate. He then ran up the overhead bridge located near the bus stop and fled from the victim. **The victim tried to run after the accused but could not catch up**. The victim made a search around the vicinity but **did not manage to locate the accused**. After which, the victim called the police for assistance as she felt outraged by the accused’s actions \[emphasis mine\].”

## The appropriate sentencing band and starting point

29     The accused had intruded the victim’s private parts, namely her breast (albeit over her clothes) which was committed on public transport. The victim was angered by the accused’s act, tried to chase after the accused who managed to flee from the scene but was subsequently arrested by the police. On a combination of these factors, I agree with the prosecution that the present case would comfortably fall into the lower end of Band 2 with a starting point of 5-6 months imprisonment.

## Offender specific factors

30     In Kunasekaran’s case Chan J recognised that “a plea of guilt is regarded as a mitigating factor that might entitle an offender to a reduced sentence because the plea of guilt: (a) can be a subjective expression of genuine remorse and contrition, which can be taken into account as a personal mitigating factor; (b) spares the victim the ordeal of having to testify, thereby saving the victim the horror of having to relive the incident; and (c) saves the resources of the State which would otherwise have been expended if there were a trial \[at 66\].”

31     I therefore was prepared to give the accused a sentencing discount on account of his plea of guilt.

32     On his letter of apology and offer of compensation to the victim, I took these as neutral factors as these events had taken place after he was arrested. In any event, such acts of remorse did not occur immediately after the offence when the accused fled the scene after the victim’s anger at being outraged with the victim giving chase.

## The sentence

33     Both the prosecution and the accused had cited a number of sentencing precedents for s 354(1) Penal Code cases. I am mindful of Chan J cautionary note in Kunasekaran’s case that “….sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations are of relatively little, if any, precedential value because they are unreasoned and hence it will not be possible to discern what had weighed on the mind of the sentencing judge or why the sentencing judge had approached the matter in a particular way… \[at para 62\]”.

34     Nonetheless, with regard to the two newspaper cases cited by the accused, these did not involve the touching of breasts but rather the victim’s thigh. As such, I did not find these cases helpful. The three cases cited by the prosecution had more similarities with the present case where the victim’s breast had been intruded over her clothes but I note that there were also some differences such as the wearing of a surgical mask in Andy Yung’s case, additional contact such as the kissing of the victim’s cheek in Kundu’s case and the fact that the victim was a school girl in Muhammad Syihabuddin’s case. The sentences imposed in those three cases ranged from 5 to 6 months.

35     In the circumstances, applying a discount to the starting point of 5-6 months in view of the accused’s plea of guilt, on, I imposed a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment on the accused.

36     The accused was granted a deferment of sentence and filed an appeal prior to serving sentence. He was granted a stay of execution pending appeal and is currently on bail bond of $10,000.
