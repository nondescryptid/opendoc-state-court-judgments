\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9124/2019/01.\]

10 July 2019

### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

The accused, male, 19 years old, pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt to his father, aged 49 years old then (“victim”), with an 8cm-blade knife by stabbing and slashing the said victim, which offence is punishable under section 326 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed) (“PC”). One other charge for voluntarily causing hurt to the same victim by punching and kicking the right side of his face and right lateral side of his body near the rib cage area multiple times, which offence is punishable under section 323 PC, was taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing.

2       I called for both the reformative training (“RT report”) and probation suitability reports (“probation report”). The accused was found not suitable for probation but suitable for reformative training.

3       On 28 May 2019, the accused was sentenced to reformative training, with the minimum detention period of six months. Dissatisfied with the sentence, the accused filed a notice of appeal the next day. He is currently on bail pending the appeal.

## Charges

4       For completeness, the proceeded charge states as follows:

DAC 918248/2018 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt)

You, Loy Zhong Huan, Dylan, male/19 years old, are charged that you on the 29th day of November 2016, at or about 8.41 a.m., at the common corridor on the 7th floor of Block 506 Bishan Street 11, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Loy Shiang Chian, _to wit_, by stabbing and slashing the said Loy Shiang Chian multiple times with a knife with blade length of about 8cm, which is an instrument for cutting, causing the said Loy Shiang Chian to be, during the space of 20 days, unable to follow his ordinary pursuits, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed).

5       The TIC charge is reproduced below:

MAC 912174/2018 (Voluntarily causing hurt)

You, Loy Zhong Huan, Dylan, male/19 years old, are charged that you on the 29th day of November 2016, at or about 8.41 a.m., at the common corridor on the 7th floor of Block 506 Bishan Street 11, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Loy Shiang Chian, _to wit_, by punching and kicking the said Loy Shiang Chian’s right face and right lateral side of his body near the rib cage area multiple times, you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed).

## Summary of Facts

6       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts pertaining to the above proceeded charge, without qualification. The salient points are as follows:

(a)     The complainant is the victim’s neighbour who was residing opposite the victim’s unit at the material time.

(b)     The victim is the accused’s father. At the material time, the accused was a student and residing at his paternal grandfather’s flat.

(c)     Investigations revealed that before 18 November 2016, the accused had been asking the victim for money and claimed that he needed $3,000 to pay for rides as part of his work to survey Uber drivers on behalf of Grab. However, the victim only gave the accused $1,000 and transferred the same into his account.

(d)     After spending the $1,000, the accused requested for the remainder amount of $2,000 from the victim. However, the victim rejected the accused’s requests a few times. On 29 November 2016, at about 6.00am, the accused had also requested for $2,000 from his grandparents but was rejected by them as well.

(e)     The accused decided to confront the victim at his unit and proceeded to the victim’s unit. He also brought along a steak knife with blade length measuring about 8-cm (“the said knife”), which he took from his grandfather’s unit.

(f)     On 29 November 2016 at about 8.30am, the victim was leaving for work when he saw the accused hiding beside a shoe cabinet outside his unit. The accused demanded to know why the victim refused to give him the money as requested and started to push and shove the victim. In response, the victim warned the accused not to touch him, and told him that he would not be giving any money to the accused and that he needed to leave for work. The victim proceeded to latch the gate of his unit, but the accused continued to push and shove the victim, resulting in the victim dropping his key pouch.

(g)     The accused picked up the victim’s key pouch and the victim asked for it to be returned back to him. However, the accused threw the key pouch towards a drain along the corridor. The victim went over to pick the said key pouch.

(h)     As the victim was picking up his key pouch from the drain, the accused took the said knife and started to stab the victim’s head continuously with it for about two to three times. This resulted in the victim stumbling and falling to the ground, whereupon the accused took the opportunity to grab the victim’s key pouch. The victim screamed for help and tried to stop the accused from using his key to enter the unit. There was no one at home in the victim’s unit then.

(i)     The accused, however, continued to stab and slash the victim multiple times. He also punched and kicked the victim multiple times.

(j)     The victim continued to scream for help and tried to fend off the accused’s blows with his hands but to no avail. The accused then shoved a pink recyclable bag into the victim’s mouth. However, when the victim pulled out the recyclable bag from his mouth, the accused shoved it back into the victim’s mouth again. While the victim was still lying on the floor with the haversack strapped on his back, the accused yanked the haversack which pulled the victim’s body and shook him around.

(k)     At this juncture, the victim tried to reach for his mobile phone to call his wife but the accused attempted to pull it out of his hand. The victim then lay on his mobile phone to prevent the accused from taking it. The accused then sat on the victim and struggled with the victim for the latter’s mobile phone. During the struggle, when the victim was still lying in a prone position on the floor, the accused also kicked the victim on his face.

(l)     At this juncture, the complainant and her mother heard the commotion outside their unit. When they noticed the accused and the victim struggling and blood along the corridor, the complainant called the police.

(m)     When the paramedics arrived at the incident location, the victim was lying on the floor, near a pool of blood. They observed the victim to be weak and in pain. The accused was observed to be looking distressed and walking around the corridor.

(n)     The victim was conveyed to hospital via ambulance. He sustained the following injuries:

a.       Multiple stab wounds and lacerations over the scalp;

b.       Left 5th metacarpal dorsum stab wound;

c.       Two facial lacerations;

d.       Scalp hematomas.

(o)     The victim was admitted into hospital for three days. He was also given hospitalisation leave for 20 days and was therefore unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.

(p)     In a clarification medical report, it was stated that the injuries sustained by the victim would leave scars behind, and the ones on the victim’s left forehead may cause some disfigurement but not any permanent impairment.

(q)     The accused was seen at the Emergency department of the hospital and observed with ‘generalised dried blood over the upper limb, lower limb and body’. He sustained the following injuries:

a.       Tenderness over the right hand;

b.       Tenderness over the right wrist;

c.       Tenderness over the left heel;

d.       Fracture of the right 5th metacarpal and suspicious fracture of the right wrist.

(r)     As a result of the incident, the victim’s family (excluding the accused) moved out of the victim’s unit temporarily for about two months as they were concerned for their safety.

## Antecedents

7       The accused is a first offender.

## Prosecution’s Submissions

8       The prosecution urged the court to call for only the RT report. As the accused is a young offender, rehabilitation and deterrence would form the dominant sentencing considerations. This was especially so in view of the following aggravating factors:

a)     where the attack by the accused on the victim was premeditated as he brought a knife to confront the victim;

b)     the attack was also vicious;

c)     severity of the injuries sustained by the victim.

9       It was submitted that probation would be wholly inappropriate as probation would only be imposed on cases where rehabilitation would take centre-stage as a sentencing consideration.

## Mitigation

10     Defence counsel had urged this court to consider calling a probation report. Whilst it is not disputed that the current offences are serious, it was submitted that whether rehabilitation retains primacy in the sentencing matrix depends on the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the court’s consideration on whether the particular offender’s capacity for rehabilitation is demonstrably high, such that it outweighs the public policy concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against probation (see _Praveen s/o Krishnan v PP_ \[2018\] 3 SLR 1300 (“_Praveen_”) at \[29\]).

11     In that regard, the defence submitted that the accused’s capacity for rehabilitation should be assessed after the probation report is called for. Further, it was highlighted that the accused committed the offence when he was 16 years old and is now actively engaged in school. In particular, he is undergoing a diploma course in the Republic Polytechnic (“RP”) where he is one year away from graduation.

12     Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences, I was minded to call both the RT and probation reports where the latter would provide me with more information on the accused’s background and allow me to better assess the accused’s prospects for rehabilitation as well as to consider all sentencing options available.

13     The accused was found to be not suitable for probation but mentally and physically suitable for reformative training at level 1 intensity of rehabilitation.

## Prosecution’s further submissions

14     Following the two-stage approach in sentencing young offenders in the case of _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ 1 SLR 334 (“_Boaz Koh_”), it was submitted that both rehabilitation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing considerations for the following reasons:

a)     The accused is a young offender, who is currently below 21 years old and was 16 years old at the material time. In that regard, rehabilitation would thus retain its primacy in the sentencing matrix.

b)     General and specific deterrence would also be warranted in the present case given that the offence committed by the accused is serious and that severe physical and emotional harm was caused to the victim. Further, the accused’s act of bringing the knife to confront the victim also demonstrated a high degree of premeditation.

15     Reformative training would thus be the most appropriate sentence as it is geared towards the rehabilitation of the offender under a structured environment while avoiding the danger of exposing the young offender to the potentially unsettling influence of an adult prison environment[^1].

16     It was further submitted that a sentence of probation would be clearly unsuitable for the following reasons[^2]:

a)     The assessment and recommendations by the probation officer, Ms Ter Shao Wei (“PO”) and the psychologist are fair and comprehensive and should thus be given considerable weight;

b)      Lack of genuine remorse: As assessed by the PO, there was a lack of attempts by the accused to express remorse and acknowledge his wrongdoing. Additionally, his numerous inconsistencies and attempts to downplay his role in his account of events to the various agencies strongly suggest his lack of genuine remorse.

c)      Lack of familial support and supervision: Whilst the accused’s grandparents have indicated that they are willing to supervise him, it is clear that they are unable to exert a sufficient degree of supervision over the accused. This was in light of the grandparents’ account that the effectiveness of their advice (to abide by the probation conditions and against further re-offending) would depend on the accused’s choice to be receptive or not. They also expressed that they would ‘refrain from angering (the accused) by being mindful of not confronting or nagging at him’,

17     On the facts, it was further submitted that the accused did not demonstrate any exceptionally high capacity for rehabilitation, such that it would outweigh the need for general and specific deterrence.

## Defence’s further submissions

18     In further elaboration of the points raised in \[10\] to \[11\] above, the defence submitted for probation to be imposed instead of a sentence of reformative training for the following reasons:

a)     Rehabilitation would be the primary sentencing consideration in the current case as the accused had committed the present offences when he was only 16 years old and a first offender at the material time. It was an one-off incident and for which the accused has not re-offended for the past three years;

b)     The accused has strong potential for reform given that his conduct in school has been generally positive and that he has been constructively engaged in part-time employment in order to supplement his parents’ allowance. He is surrounded by positive peers and engaged in recreational activities. He has also been abiding to the trial time curfew restrictions pending the assessment of both the probation and RT reports.

c)     The accused has strong familial support in that he enjoys a stable relationship with his paternal grandparents, who are willing to supervise him and execute the bond to ensure his good behaviour should probation order be imposed.

d)     The accused is genuinely remorseful for his actions as he has pleaded guilty to the offences to ‘assume responsibility for his actions and to make amends for them[^3]’. The accused feels ‘regretful and ashamed’ for his actions and realises that ‘he should not have harmed his father… and understood that it must be difficult for his father to accept what he had done[^4]’. He has not made a formal apology to date to his parents, as he ‘felt awkward to do so[^5]’.

#### Weight to be given to the probation report

19     As the PO has not recommended probation, it was submitted that the opinion of the probation officer should not be conclusive as to the sentence imposed (see _Praveen_ at \[65\]). As noted by the learned Justice of Appeal, Justice Steven Chong, in _Praveen_ that ‘it would be wrong in principle for the probation officer to usurp the discretion clearly vested in the courts’.

20     Furthermore, the assessment of the PO, namely, that the accused’s ‘lack of attempts to express remorse and acknowledge his wrongdoing to his parents as the first and necessary step to reconciliation’ which ‘_might_ indicate his continued lack of victim empathy and minimisation of his actions ‘, should not outweigh the remaining evidence in respect of the accused’s remorse. It was submitted that the PO does not make a finding that the accused lacks remorse in respect of the incident but rather, that the accused lacked attempts to express remorse to _his parents_. In that regard, the accused’s explanation for this failure to express remorse directly to his parents was because he felt it would be ‘awkward[^6]’. It was further pointed out by the defence that the accused is willing to make a public and sincere apology to his parents in respect of the incident.

21     Additionally, the tenor of both the probation and RT reports is that the accused’s immediate family (namely, his parents and sister) is unwilling to reconcile with the accused as he is unwilling to own up to his actions. In that regard, it was submitted that the ‘subjective opinion of Dylan’s immediate family cannot be a reliable gauge of his remorse[^7]’.

22     The probation report was largely prepared on the basis of the psychological report (prepared by the Ministry of Family and Social Development (“MSF”) Clinical Psychologist, Ms Yammie Chin (“psychologist”), dated 3 April 2019 - “psychological report”), and the circumstances surrounding the offence which took place more than two years ago. It was submitted that the psychologist had failed to give any weight to the accused’s ‘expression of his regret and remorse over the commission of the offence’. Further the psychologist’s assessment of the accused’s violent offending behaviour was based on an alleged confrontation between the accused and his paternal grandfather in October 2018 (“October 2018 incident’), where the grandfather’s version was accepted over the accused’s version of events and to which she concluded that the accused has a ‘tendency to downplay his violence’[^8].

23     Further, it was submitted that the psychologist’s conclusion that the accused lacked insight into his need for intervention should be seen in the context that the accused no longer experiences anger management issues at this juncture and is therefore unsure of the value of the therapy sessions. This should not be taken against the accused as he has since been leading a ‘positive, pro-social lifestyle’.

24     Whilst it was highlighted by the PO that the accused was ‘largely non-compliant’ with an earlier mandatory counselling order (imposed by the Family Justice Court pursuant to the issuance of a Personal Protection Order – “CGO”) as he only attended 3 out of 13 sessions in 2017, the defence posits that the accused may have been immature then as his non-compliance was due to his school activities. Nonetheless, it was submitted that the accused is agreeable to undergo any treatment or therapy sessions as recommended by the psychologist[^9], as part of the probation conditions, to assuage any potential concerns that the court may have of the accused’s re-offending.

25     Given the excessive reliance by both the PO and the psychologist on events that took place more than two years ago in reaching their conclusions, it was submitted that ‘their assessment of his rehabilitative potential is misplaced[^10]’. Further, it was further submitted that the PO had given insufficient weight to the accused’s ‘maturation and growth’ and ‘substantial amount of time that has elapsed since the commission of the offence’, where there has since been ‘many glimpses’ of the accused’s strong potential to reform[^11].

#### Effect of not imposing probation

26     A sentence of reformative training would be ‘immensely disruptive’ to the accused’s educational endeavours as he is currently in his third and final year in the Integrate Events Management Diploma course in RP. A similar sentiment was noted by the High Court in _Praveen’s_ case at \[73\] where Chong JA was concerned that if the appellant were sentenced to reformative training, he would have to enlist for National Service upon release. This would result in the appellant being effectively removed from the education system for a considerable period of time and that there would be the ‘real risk’ that the appellant might not have the motivation to resume his education after serving reformative training and National Service.

#### Probation with stringent conditions

27     Should the court view that a deterrent message ought to be sent on the facts of the current case, the defence urged this court to consider probation with more stringent conditions attached to the order, similar to what was held in _Praveen_ where Chong JA imposed the maximum duration of probation (of 36 months) coupled with a hostel residence which would sufficiently ‘meet the objective of deterrence’ (see _Praveen_ at \[75\]).

28     Incorporating a hostel residence as one of the probation conditions would allow the accused to spend time away from his father, ‘cool off’ and complete the treatment recommended by the psychologist. This would meet both rehabilitative and deterrent purposes, improve the accused’s chances of reintegrating with his family and avoid ruining his future as opposed to a period of incarceration, which ‘would create or deepen any (residual) resentment’ that the accused and his father holds against each other.[^12]

## Decision of the court

### Sentencing considerations in relation to a young offender

29     As a starting point, rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration in determining the appropriate sentence for a young offender aged 21 years and below (see _Maurice Mok_ at \[21\] and followed in _Leon Russel Francis_ at \[13\]).

30     However, as noted by Chong JA in _Praveen’s_ case, at \[28\], when a young offender is convicted of a _serious offence_, the principle of rehabilitation may be outweighed by other considerations such as the need for general and specific deterrence and even retribution: _Leon Russel Francis v PP_ \[2014\] 4 SLR 651 (“_Leon Russel Francis_”) at \[13\] and _PP v Justin Heng Zheng Hao_ \[2012\] SGDC 219 (“_Justin Heng_”) at \[13\]. Such offences include serious sexual crimes (see _PP v Mohamed Noh Hafiz bin Osman_ \[2003\] 4 SLR(R) 281), crimes involving violence, robbery, rioting and drug offences, in particular, those which relate to trafficking (_Justin Heng_ at \[13\] and \[26\]).

31     In considering whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix, the court should consider whether the particular offender’s _capacity for rehabilitation_ is demonstrably high, so that it outweighs the public policy concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against probation (_Justin Hen_g at \[13\] and \[15\], cited at _Leon Russel Francis_ at \[14\] – _Praveen_ at \[29\]). In _Praveen_ at \[30\], it was further stated that in determining the offender’s capacity for rehabilitation and the appropriate sentence, the following considerations set out in _Leon Russel Francis_ (for drug cases) at \[15\] are relevant:

(a)     the strength of familial support and the degree of supervision provided by the offender’s family for his rehabilitation;

(b)     the frequency and intensity of the offender’s drug-related activities;

(c)     the genuineness of remorse demonstrated by the offender; and

(d)     the presence of risk factors such as negative peers or bad habits.

32     Given the seriousness of the offences as well as the need for rehabilitation, I am also mindful of the observations made by the learned Justice of Appeal, Justice VK Rajah (as he then was) in the case of _PP v Mohamed Al Ansari bin Basri_ \[2008\] 1 SLR 449 (“_Al Ansari_”) at \[58\]:

.. it is clear that reformative training by itself, with the attendant element of incarceration, implicitly carries with it a significant deterrent effect, both on a specific and general level. As such, it is my view that the sentencing option of reformative training provides the courts with a middle ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence in relation to young offenders.

33     As noted by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the case of _Boaz Koh_ at \[36\], that whilst probation is conducive to rehabilitation, it is not the only sentencing option for a youthful offender where rehabilitation remains the dominant sentencing consideration. Reformative training too is geared towards the rehabilitation of the offender, which allows the court to sentence the offender to a rehabilitative programme under a structured environment while avoiding the danger of exposing the young offender to the potentially unsettling influence of an adult prison environment (see _Boaz Koh_ at \[38\]). It was further observed at \[39\] that where the court is concerned to incorporate a sufficient element of deterrence within the overarching focus on the goal of rehabilitation, reformative training would be the preferred sentencing option in cases where a degree of deterrence is desired.

34     Thus, in determining the balance to be struck between the dominant consideration for rehabilitation and the need for deterrence, some relevant factors to be considered as stated in _Al Ansari_ at \[67\] included:

(a)     the seriousness of the offence;

(b)     the culpability of the offender;

(c)     the existence of antecedents;

(d)     the nature of the rehabilitation best suited for the offender;

(e)     the availability of familial support in the rehabilitative efforts; and

(f)     any other special reasons or need for rehabilitation.

35     With the above sentencing considerations in mind, I now turn to the factual matrix of the present case.

## The appropriate sentence

36     It is undisputed that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration in this case especially where the accused was 16 years old at the material time and currently 19 years old (at the time of sentencing). Neither was it disputed by the defence that there was a need for deterrence given the following aggravating factors: seriousness of the offences, premeditation by the accused in bringing the knife to confront the victim, the use of the knife by the accused in committing the offence (namely, under section 326 PC) as well as the serious injuries sustained by the victim, particularly where there would be scars on the victim’s forehead, which may cause disfigurement. The issue then is whether rehabilitation should take centre-stage in the sentencing matrix such that probation would typically be imposed or reformative training, which would be the ‘middle ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence’ (_Al-Ansari_ at \[58\]).

37     It is also undisputed that there are protective factors in this case, namely, that the accused is currently constructively engaged (namely, studying for a diploma course in RP as well as undertaking part-time employment as an ad hoc badminton coach), has the ability to abide by rules and regulations, is in contact with positive peers and is engaged in recreational activities. The key plank of the PO’s overall assessment, however, in not recommending probation, is the accused’s lack of genuine remorse amongst other reasons. As this is one of the critical factors in assessing an accused person’s capacity for rehabilitation (see \[31\] above), I now turn to the issue of whether there was genuineness of remorse demonstrated by the accused.

#### Whether there was genuine remorse demonstrated by the accused

38     The defence had argued that the PO did not make a finding that the accused lacks remorse in respect of the incident but rather, that the accused lacked attempts to express remorse to _his parents_. I found this to be a curious argument in that the two (namely, expressing remorse in relation _to the incident_ and expressing remorse _towards his parents_) are intrinsically linked given that the current offences were committed against his father and that there has been no forthcoming apology made by the accused to the victim to date.

39     Whilst it has been accepted that the relationship between the accused and his parents may have been somewhat strained just prior to the commission of the offences up to date, the fact is that serious acts of violence were committed against the victim (albeit within one transaction at the material time). Whilst the accused may have professed remorse in recent times, I was however, doubtful of the same as there has been no evidence either of any conduct displayed or steps taken by the accused to demonstrate that he was genuinely contrite for committing the acts of violence towards his father.

40     The accused claims that his failure to express remorse is that he felt ‘awkward’ to do so. However, he was still able to text greetings to his parents on festive occasions and had even absolutely no qualms in asking his mother for money[^13]. Additionally, he had also acknowledged that he lied to the psychologist as well as the psychiatrist from the Child Guidance Clinic (“CGC psychiatrist”) regarding certain aspects of the incident (namely, whether his father had brought or was in possession of the knife at the material time), in order to ‘avoid incarceration[^14]’ and ‘prevent himself from getting into trouble with the law[^15]’. Furthermore, the psychologist had also assessed that the accused ‘was inclined to externalize blame for his transgressions’ and ‘failed to assume responsibility for his behaviour and lacked remorse[^16]’. In the absence of any contrary assessment of the accused tendered by the defence, I was inclined to give full weight to the psychological report.

41     I also note that the accused is now prepared to apologise to the father just prior to sentencing, when in the past, he had difficulties in doing so (according to him). In the absence of any explanation as to how his “awkwardness” has suddenly dissipated, it strongly suggests that this sudden change of heart is more calculated to secure the most favourable outcome for himself, rather than a genuine gesture of remorse. This would also be consistent with the psychologist’s assessment that while the accused expressed regret for the current offences, the accused ‘appeared to be focused on the negative self-impact (e.g. he might be incarcerated and viewed negatively by others) and could not articulate victim impact issues[^17]’. As similarly assessed by the PO, ‘the accused’s lack of attempts to express remorse and acknowledge his wrongdoing to his parents as the first and necessary step towards reconciliation might indicate his continued lack of victim empathy and minimization of his actions[^18]’. In light of the above, I therefore had grave concerns on the accused’s genuine remorse.

42     The defence had submitted that the accused’s past aggressive behaviours should be given less weight since it occurred some three years ago, as compared to his current conduct where since living with his paternal grandparents, there were no such threatening or aggressive behaviours. I am of the view that the past instances of aggression as reported by his family would be pertinent and relevant in the overall assessment of the accused on his attitude towards taking ownership and responsibility for his wrongdoings past and present especially more so if the past actions also relate to acts of aggression similar to the current offences pertaining to domestic violence. More importantly, such incidents also provide a glimpse of the accused’s character, which the court has to give regard to in determining whether to place an offender on probation (see section 5(1) Probation of Offenders Act, Chapter 252). I am therefore in agreement with the PO that it would be necessary for the accused to acknowledge such past wrongdoing and work on his risk issues before any rehabilitative interventions can truly take place.

43     Further, in referring to the past acts of aggression of the accused towards his family, the accused was ‘observed to downplay the psychological harm caused to his family by his aggressive behaviours and to justify his anger towards them due to their reported mistreatment towards him[^19]’. This seems to be a consistent pattern of behaviour where his acts of aggression escalated to the commission of the current offences. In particular, the psychologist also states as follows at \[17\] of her psychological report:

Overall, the family violence appeared to be triggered by Dylan’s resentment surrounding the theft accusations and desperation for money. The current assessment suggested that Dylan presented with antagonistic and blaming stance towards others when interpersonal conflicts arise. The lack of problem solving skills to resolve family conflict and pro-violence attitudes, particularly his desire to establish dominance over his family, were likely to have perpetuated his aggression towards his family.

44     The accused’s immediate family, has also informed the PO that they were not willing to reconcile with the accused until he has shown remorse for what he has done. The father stated that he did not want to be disappointed again. His mother remained fearful of him and his sister ‘felt that he was untrustworthy’ and ‘remained fearful of him’[^20]. Counsel had submitted that the ‘subjective views’ of the accused’s family should not be given too much weight in view of the accused’s current good conduct. I agree with the defence that the accused’s father who is also the victim in the current case, may have been very hurt. However, I did not think that the peculiar facts of the current case suggest that the accused’s family would have any reasons or motive to be less than economical with the truth. Their accounts have been consistent. I would think that they would know the accused best, having lived with him for the first sixteen years of the accused’s life, and in that regard, their views cannot be ignored.

45     I was thus of the view that in light of the numerous inconsistent accounts of the accused’s past acts of aggression and threatening behaviours[^21] as compared to his family’s accounts, including denials of the same, as well as his downplaying of his role in relation to the current incident[^22], it clearly demonstrated a lack of genuine remorse in acknowledging any wrongdoing on his part. Furthermore, it did not go unnoticed either that the accused had also deliberately lied to his ex-girlfriend that he was placed on probation (when he was clearly not!) and was unwilling for the PO to verify from the ex-girlfriend about the accused’s account on how he was able to purchase certain relatively expensive items (amounting to $3,000) for her (which came from the purported sale proceeds of his online sale accounts)[^23] when he suspiciously did not have the means to do so.

#### Lack of insight

46     As noted by the psychologist in \[43\] above, the accused’s acts of violence were triggered by the family’s allegations of missing money from the home as well as his desperation for money (see \[6\] above). Further, at \[13\] of the psychological report, it was assessed that the accused’s strategies to cope with interpersonal conflicts were limited to avoidance (for example, cutting ties with others instead of addressing the conflict) and distraction techniques (for example, eating and playing badminton), which could have led to unresolved issues with his family.

47     The accused claims that his non-compliance with CGO, were due to his difficulties in juggling between school work and extra-curricular activities, and which the defence had submitted was the accused’s lack of maturity to appreciate the need for therapy then. I found these to be convenient excuses especially since the accused has continually failed to see the need for counselling or therapy even at this juncture[^24] as he claims that he was not experiencing any anger or aggression issues currently[^25].

48     Given the accused’s current lack of insight into the need for any intervention to address the triggers that precipitated the violence towards his family members, his inability to regulate negative emotions arising from interpersonal conflict, coupled with prior poor compliance towards the CGO, I therefore had serious concerns on the accused’s ‘readiness to reflect on and address his risk issues, as well as his ability to sustain motivation to complete treatment’ as observed by the PO as well[^26].

#### Lack of effective familial supervision

49     The victim is the accused’s father. Both his parents have categorically stated that they were not prepared to reconcile with the accused until he is prepared to take responsibility for his wrongdoing. In that regard, the parents would not be suitable to supervise or monitor him at this juncture should he be considered for probation. The paternal grandparents (“grandparents”), whom the accused has been staying with for the past three years, have indicated their willingness to supervise the accused.

50     Whilst the accused may enjoy a stable and close relationship with his elderly grandparents, I have, however, serious doubts on whether they would be effective in exerting any form of firm supervision or guidance over the accused. First, the grandparents have indicated that their role would be limited to reminding him to abide by the probation conditions and advising him against further re-offending. This would also be dependent on whether the accused was receptive to their advice in the first place or not as the accused was ‘independent in his decisions[^27]’. This would necessarily imply that in the event the accused does not accept his grandparents’ advice, that would be the end of the matter and they would thus not be able to exert any positive influence over him. To my mind, the grandparents appear to be only prepared to play a limited role in merely reminding the accused to fulfil any formal conditions or obligations under the probation order, rather than playing a more effective and active role in engaging with the accused, disciplining or guiding him in dealing with interpersonal conflicts, instead of the accused acting up in anger or displaying aggression (which was the case in the past).

51     Second, the grandparents’ permissiveness is apparent when they reported to the PO that they would refrain from angering the accused by being mindful of not confronting or nagging him. Both grandparents have also admitted that they dote on the accused[^28]. Third, they have also declined to be engaged by social support services as they felt that they are able to manage the accused[^29].

52     In light of the above, it is clear that the grandparents would not be equipped with the skills necessary to tackle the accused’s recurrent poor ability to regulate his negative emotions when he is confronted of any wrongdoing in future, given that they are fearful of how he would even react should they confront him or point out his mistakes. It would be unsurprising that should the accused react adversely to any allegations of wrongdoing in future, the grandparents may in all likelihood give in to his demands in order not to anger him. This would in turn also not benefit the accused in the long term in being effectively rehabilitated. I therefore had little confidence in the grandparents’ ability to effectively supervise and guide the accused should probation be granted.

53     In relation to the October 2018 incident, the paternal grandfather (“grandfather”) had initially informed the PO that the accused had pushed him after the latter had confronted the accused about stealing money amounting to $1,000, which was left on the table for renovation works[^30]. Defence counsel took instructions from the grandparents and clarified as follows[^31]: that the grandfather was upset but he was unable to recall what the incident was about or what happened thereafter, although the accused acknowledged that it was regarding the grandfather confronting him about the stolen money. The grandfather also claimed that he was unable to recall if the accused had pushed him or if he had in fact stumbled backwards as a result of the accused trying to release himself from the grandfather’s grip. The grandmother claimed that the grandfather had lifted the stool and grabbed the accused’s arm, following which the latter tried to release himself from the grandfather’s grip by pushing him, which caused the grandfather to stumble backwards. She was however unable to recall details as to when or what precipitated the incident.

54     In view of the differing and unclear accounts given by the grandparents, as well as the absence of any explanation as to the grandfather’s inability to remember (at the time of sentencing) if the accused had pushed him or not during the October 2018 when he had informed the PO of the same, I therefore had grave doubts on whether the grandparents can indeed be relied upon to give trustworthy accounts on any future infractions or breaches of the probation conditions, should the accused be placed on probation. Their overprotectiveness and permissiveness, further casts doubt on whether they can effectively supervise the accused.

## Conclusion

55     The complexities of the current case cannot be understated especially where it involves domestic violence amongst immediate family members – albeit, between spouses, or parents and their children. Whilst the physical injuries may heal with time, the emotional scars still remain as long as the familial bonds that have been broken are not mended. One crucial aspect of taking that first step for reconciliation is the need for the accused to recognise the underlying cause for his wrongdoing and taking responsibility for what he has done.

56     Whilst the accused may have professed remorse through instructions given to the defence, I was, however, not convinced of his genuine remorse in view of his differing accounts given to the different agencies regarding the current offences, and especially in light of his admission that he had deliberately lied to them to avoid any incarceration. The accused’s continued minimisation of responsibility for the offences is troubling.

57     What is also significant is the fact that the accused’s parents and sister have also cast doubts on his genuine remorse and have in fact declined reconciliation at this stage (see \[44\] above). After all, these are his immediate family members who would know him well and would no doubt want the best for the accused. In fact, the accused’s parents have been financially supporting the accused even after he had moved to the grandparents’ residence since 17 November 2016[^32] to date. There is thus no question that they deliberately want to cut off ties with the accused at this stage, save for the fact that their only wish and hope is for the accused to genuinely acknowledge his wrongdoing and not because it would only result in a favourable outcome for himself.

58     I am of the view that the lack of genuine remorse demonstrated by the accused would be one of the more compelling grounds which would override the weight to be given to the protective factors as highlighted by the PO, as the converse would be true, in that genuine remorse would be the first step necessary for effective rehabilitation in the community to take place. In light of the above, I was thus in full agreement with the PO that probation would be unsuitable. Furthermore, I was unpersuaded to find that there were exceptional grounds to suggest that the accused’s rehabilitative capacity was demonstrably high, such that it tips in favour of rehabilitation playing centre-stage, which would necessitate the imposition of probation either at home or in a hostel residential setting.

59     The psychologist had also opined that ‘the lack of negative consequences for his earlier threatening behaviour towards his family emboldened him to inflict physical harm onto his father[^33]’. This observation coupled with the aggravating factors as highlight by the prosecution in \[8\] above, as well as the accused’s moderate risk of family violence[^34], and past non-compliance to undergo counselling, would thus necessitate a sentence that must reflect a measure of deterrence within an overarching need for rehabilitation, for which reformative training would be the most appropriate response given the circumstances.

60     The accused was found mentally and physically fit to undergo reformative training. Accordingly, I was of the view that with a firm guiding hand, the accused should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre for the minimum period of six months, to reform him as well as for the prevention of crime.

_The accused was sentenced to reformative training for the minimum period of detention of 6 months._

It was also further reported by his parents that he had unplugged the closed-circuit television (CCTV) that was installed in the home, broken their bedroom doorknob with a hammer and tampered with the safes containing their valuables.
