30 December 2021 - Judgment reserved

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Background Facts

1       The Plaintiff’s Claim and the Defendant’s Counterclaim in this suit involves the project relating to the conversion of the then Marina Bay Sands Theatre into three venues, namely, the Marquee nightclub, the KOMA restaurant and Avenue, a nightclub and restaurant. Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”) was the employer or owner of the said project and the Defendant was the Project Manager with its role described as _“to basically, facilitate all the design and construction of the Sands theatre conversion of the 3 venues”_[^1]. The Plaintiff was engaged by the Defendant as a subcontractor for the conversion of one of the three venues - the Marquee nightclub (“the Project”). For the Marquee nightclub conversion (“the Project”), ISOTeam TMG Pte. Ltd (“ISOTeam”) was the main contractor, and the structural engineer was Arup Singapore Pte Ltd (“Arup”)[^2].

2       Pursuant to the engagement of the Plaintiff for the conversion relating to the Marquee nightclub, the Defendant first engaged the Plaintiff on 21st December 2018 for the Plaintiff to supply, deliver and install Milos Trusses on the site pursuant to “Quotation No. 2018-8128-PP-Milos-Truss” (“the Milos Truss Works” / “Milos Truss Quotation”). Shortly thereafter, the Defendant engaged the Plaintiff on 28th December 2018 to carry out delivery, installation, rigging, testing, and commissioning of the Movecat hoists on the Project site pursuant to “Quotation 2018-8135-PP-MCMQ.3” (“the Movecat Hoist Works”/ “Movecat Hoist Quotation”). Thereafter, on 20th February 2019, the Defendant engaged the Plaintiff to obtain certifications from a Ministry of Manpower Singapore (“MOM”) registered Professional Engineer (“PE”) with respect to the Movecat Hoist Works (“PE Certification of Movecat Hoist Works”) and with respect to the lighting trusses and supporting system (“PE Certification of Supporting System”).

3       On 7 March 2019, the Plaintiff’s representative Ted Singh (“Mr Singh”) and the Defendant’s representative Jon Coney (“Mr Coney”) both signed off on a Handing/Taking Over Checklist (“the HTO Document”).

4       A few days after signing off on the HTO Document, on 11 March 2019, an incident occurred which resulted in the emission of water causing damage to the works, fixtures, and other properties on the Project site (“Water Damage Incident”). As a result of the Water Damage Incident, on 14 March 2019, the Defendant engaged the Plaintiff to carry out the replacement of the hoist system for the Marquee nightclub via “Quotation No. 2019-8140-PP-Damage-Hoist System” (“the Hoist Replacement Works” / “Hoist Replacement Quotation”).

5       On 29th March 2019, the Defendant engaged the Plaintiff to perform works on the Funktion One System on the Project site pursuant to Quotation No. 2019-19138-PPFunktion One System (“the Funktion One System”). The Plaintiff issued Tax Invoice No. 19117 in respect of the works under this quotation on the same day. Shortly prior to the planned opening of the Marquee nightclub on 12th April 2019, the Plaintiff provided services including the re-filling of “2x Nitro Gas”, supply of “2 x Tanks 1x 3L 1 x 2L” and “MDG HAZE Liquid 20L” as well as manpower to carry out certain urgent site works required for the opening and issued Tax Invoice 19120.A on 12th April 2019 in respect thereof.

6       On 12 April 2019, the Marquee nightclub opened as planned.

## The Plaintiff’s Claim

7       The Plaintiff’s Claim is in respect of Tax Invoice No. 19117 and Tax Invoice 19120.A. It is not disputed that the Defendant had not made any payment due under these two invoices.

8       In respect of the Plaintiff’s claim under Tax Invoice No. 19117, the Defendant avers in its defence that the works were incomplete in that the Plaintiff has not provided any certifications for the works[^3].

9       In respect of the Plaintiff’s claim under Tax Invoice 19120.A, the Defendant avers that it did not order for the works performed by the manpower stated therein and is therefore not liable to pay to the Plaintiff the alleged sum of $15,450.80 under this invoice[^4].

## The Defendant’s Counterclaim

10     It is not disputed that the Defendant has made payment to the Plaintiff in respect of all the invoices issued for the Milos Truss Works, Movecat Hoist Works, PE Certification of Movecat Hoist Works, PE Certification of Supporting System and the Hoist Replacement Works, amounting to over $1.1 million or 96% of the total sum invoiced by the Plaintiff.

11     In response to the Plaintiff’s Claim, the Defendant counterclaims for damages for breach of contract and/or failure of consideration and unjust enrichment in relation to the Milos Truss Works, Movecat Hoist Works, PE Certification of Movecat Hoist Works, PE Certification of Supporting System and Hoist Replacement Works on the following grounds:

> (a)     In respect of the Milos Truss Works, the Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff had breached its contractual obligations in failing to supply and deliver milos trusses in matte black colour[^5].

> (b)     In respect of the Movecat Hoist Works, the Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff was in breach in that it had failed to carry out the Movecat Hoist Works in a good and workmanlike manner as it had failed to ensure that its installation was structurally safe, and the Defendant had to engage ISOTeam to rectify the installation and thereby suffered loss and damage[^6].

> (c)     In respect of the PE Certification of Movecat Hoist Works, the Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff was in breach or that there was a failure of consideration as the Plaintiff had failed to procure MOM certificates with the correct ownership details[^7].

> (d)     In respect of the PE Certification of Supporting System, the Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff has failed to provide the necessary certification (i.e., certify the weight which the anchor point could hold) and as such, there was a failure of consideration for the Defendant’s payment made to the Plaintiff[^8].

> (e)     In respect of the Hoist Replacement Works, the Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff was in breach in failing to deliver items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Quotation. The Defendant also alleges that the Plaintiff had, by its conduct and in its email dated 19 June 2019, evinced an intention not to perform its contractual obligations in an essential or substantial respect, thereby leading the Defendant to believe that the Plaintiff no longer intends to be bound by its contracts. In this regard, the Plaintiff is in repudiatory breach and such breach has been accepted by the Defendant and the Defendant is entitled to claim for damages arising from such repudiatory breach. Alternatively, the Defendant also alleges that there is a failure of consideration and/or unjust enrichment in respect of the Hoist Replacement Works as items 1 and 3 (a substantial part of this contract) were never delivered[^9].

12     The Defendant also alleges that it is entitled to the refund of $28,034 that was paid to the Plaintiff on 18 March 2019 under Quotation 019-19135-PP-MOVECAT (“the Movecat Operator Quotation”) as the service was not provided and/or was abortive because the replacement hoists were not delivered.

13     In addition, the Defendant alleges that there has been overcharging in relation to the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 and 19119 in the respective amounts of **$**18,944.78, $17,580.10, and $10,700.00 (totalling $47,224,88) as the said charges are in respect of Quotation 2018-8135-PP-MCMQ.3 (i.e., the Movecat Hoist Quotation) for which the Defendant has allegedly already paid under the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoice No. 19101[^10]. The Defendant therefore says there is unjust enrichment, and the Defendant is entitled to claim back the amounts it had paid under these invoices.

## Plaintiff’s response and defence to the Defendant’s Counterclaim

14     In respect of the Defendant’s counterclaim, the Plaintiff counters that both parties’ representatives had signed off on the HTO Document on 7 March 2019 confirming with respect to the list of equipment delivered and installed by the Plaintiff as follows:

> “The above works has been completed in respect as per the agreement and the Client’s directives and necessary requirements. And no rectification works is found during the handing/taking over of the work. The works are handed to (the Defendant) in a good and satisfactory condition.”

15     The Plaintiff also avers that by signing the HTO Document, the Defendant has also confirmed that,

> “The system programme, configuration, testing and commissioning was successfully carried out and no rectification work is found during the system programme, configuration, testing and commissioning. The system programme, configuration, testing and commissioning of the work are taken over by (the Defendant) in a good and satisfactory condition.”

16     The Plaintiff avers that by reason of the HTO Document, the Defendant is estopped from raising the allegations in its counterclaim. The Plaintiff further avers that the issues belatedly raised by the Defendant in response to the Plaintiff’s claim for payment under Invoice Nos. 19117 and 19120.A after it had made payments without issue are but afterthoughts[^11].

17     Specifically, in respect of each item of the Defendant’s counterclaim, the Plaintiff avers as follows:

> (a)     In respect of the Milos Truss Works, the Plaintiff says that the Defendant’s representative, Mr Coney was aware that the trusses delivered were not in matt black colour but silver colour. He had nevertheless directed the Plaintiff to proceed to install the trusses. Thereafter, the Defendant requested the Plaintiff to procure black fabric to cover the silver trusses and pursuant to that, the Plaintiff’s Quotation 2019-19140-PP-Black-JC (“Black Fabric Quotation”) was accepted by the Defendant. The Defendant has made payment of $10,432.50 under Invoice No. 19118 without raising any issue[^12].

> (b)     In respect of the Movecat Hoist Works, the Plaintiff avers that in respect of Quotation 2018-8135-PP-MCMQ.3 (the Movecat Hoist Works Quotation), the Plaintiff was engaged only for the installation of the Movecat Hoists and that for the PE certification of the Movecat Hoist Works, the Defendant was aware that it was not covered within the Movecat Hoist Works Quotation and had in fact engaged the Plaintiff to procure the PE certification under a separate quotation - 2019-1928-PP PE Certification for Light Truss and Supporting System dated 18 February 2019 (“PE Certification for Supporting System Quotation”). The Plaintiff further avers that it was not the Plaintiff’s scope of works to produce certifications for the structural adequacy or integrity of the Grid Support System and that the Defendant was all along aware that the structural engineer for the Project, Arup is responsible for this.

> (c)     In respect of the PE Certification of Movecat Hoist Works, the Plaintiff avers that it was the Defendant that had directed the Plaintiff to obtain the details for the ownership registration from ISOTeam and the Plaintiff had proceeded to obtain a registration based on the details in the Certification of Factory Registration as provided by ISOTeam to the Plaintiff.

> (d)     In respect of the PE Certification of Supporting System, the Plaintiff avers that its scope of works is confined to the certifications and works specifically mentioned in the PE Certification of Supporting System Quotation and specifically, its scope of works did not include certifications for the structural adequacy or integrity of the Grid Support System. The Plaintiff further avers that it is the structural engineer for the Project, Arup that is responsible for the certification for the structural adequacy or integrity of the Grid Support System.

> (e)     In respect of the Hoist Replacement Works, the Plaintiff avers that there has been no failure to carry out the works in relation to items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Quotation as this is contingent on the Defendant arranging for the said delivery and installation and the Defendant has failed to do so before the opening of the Marquee despite that the Plaintiff was ready and able to carry out items 1 and 3 as of 7 April 2019 and the Defendant was informed and aware of that. The Plaintiff avers that the Defendant’s request to the Plaintiff on 13 June 2019 to deliver items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Quotation is belated and an afterthought. The Plaintiff further avers that the Defendant has failed to show there was a total or partial failure of consideration and to plead or show the unjust factor for its claim of unjust enrichment. In relation to the Defendant’s claim based on unjust enrichment, the Plaintiff further avers that it had bona fide changed its position in reliance on the Defendant’s payment for items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Quotation and that by virtue of that, the Defendant is not entitled to take the position that there was unjust enrichment.

18     As for the Defendant’s allegation of overcharging in respect of the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 and 19119, the Plaintiff avers that the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoice 19112 is pursuant to Quotation 2019-19134-PP-Rigging Accessories and Power Cables; the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoice 19114 is pursuant to Quotation 2019-19136-PP-Movecat Power, Movecat and Truss and the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoice 19119 is pursuant to Quotation 2019-19141-PP-Hoist Manpower. The Plaintiff avers that these 3 invoices are for separate quotations in relation to the Movecat Hoist Quotation (2018-8136-PP-MC-MQ.3) which have been accepted by the Defendant.

19     As for the Movecat Operator Quotation, the Plaintiff avers that the Defendant had engaged the Plaintiff to arrange for a Movecat operator from Germany to set up and/or program the Movecat Hoist and pursuant to this, the Plaintiff had arranged for the Movecat operator to set up and/or program the Movecat Hoist during two periods which are 24 February 2019 to 4 March 2019 and 7 to 14 April 2019, both before and after the Water Damage Incident. The Plaintiff avers that the works under the Movecat Operator Quotation in question was confined to the works carried out during 7 to 14 April 2019 (i.e., after the Water Damage Incident) and such work was carried out and as such, the Plaintiff is entitled to the payment thereunder.

## My Decision

### The Plaintiff’s Claim

#### In Respect of Tax Invoice 19117

20     By the time of the trial and in closing submissions, parties are no longer in dispute that the Plaintiff has not carried out PE certification in respect of the Funktion One System. Therefore, the Plaintiff concedes that the Plaintiff is not entitled to payment for item 3 of Quotation No. 2019-19138-PPFunktion One System[^13]. As a result of this and as evident in parties’ closing submissions (it is to be noted also that the Defendant has not mounted any defence for its non-payment under this invoice save for its position that it is entitled to a set-off by virtue of its counterclaim), it is undisputed that the payment that is due to the Plaintiff under this invoice is $22,547.04[^14].

#### In Respect of Tax Invoice 19120.A

21     In closing submissions, the Defendant agreed that it is liable to pay for the items described as “Re-Filling of 2x Nitro Gas for opening Day” and “Supply of 2 x Tanks 1x 3L 1 x 2L” and “MDG HAZE Liquid 20L”, amounting to $940.00 (exclusive of 7% GST). The bulk of the Plaintiff’s claim under Tax Invoice 19120.A is for the supply of manpower to the Project site to prepare for the opening of the Marquee.

22     As the Defendant’s pleaded position is that it did not order for the supply of manpower under this Tax Invoice, the issue arising for my determination is whether there is an agreement between the parties for the work or supply of manpower under Tax Invoice 19120.A.

##### (1)   Whether there is an agreement between the parties for the Plaintiff to issue Tax Invoice 19120.A pursuant thereto

23     It is clear that the basis for the Plaintiff’s claim under this Tax Invoice is contractual in nature. As it is the Plaintiff that claims it is entitled to payment for the supply of manpower for the final touch-up work prior to the opening of the Marquee, the onus is on the Plaintiff to prove, on a balance of probabilities that there was an agreement or contract between the parties for the Plaintiff to supply and charge for such manpower. Put simply, it must be shown that there was an intention on the part of both parties that the transaction entered into was to have legal effect, that is, a valid contract for the supply of manpower by the Plaintiff and for the Defendant to pay for such manpower can be said to have been formed.

24     In cross-examination, the Plaintiff’s representative, Mr Singh conceded that this Tax Invoice was not preceded by a quotation.[^15]

25     Thus, it is clear that there was no prior discussion between the parties regarding the supply of manpower by the Plaintiff to prepare for the opening of the Marquee. Therefore, there was no “meeting of minds” as regards the Plaintiff’s supply of manpower for the alleged “urgent work” prior to the opening of the Marquee.

26     In closing submissions, the Defendant relied on the case of _Xanthopoulos, Elias v. Rotating Offshore Solutions Pte Ltd & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 197</span> (“_Xanthopoulos_”) which held at \[47\] that, “... In order for a binding agreement to be formed, there must be a single point in time when the necessary consensus _ad idem_ is reached”. Valerie Thean J stated that where parties have entered into a chain of discussions, there must be a “deeper appreciation of the context of the agreement” by examining “the whole course of negotiations” and a contract is only formed at the point of “unqualified acceptance” as it is important to ensure that a party “who subjectively views that he is merely engaging in negotiations is not unfairly bound by a contract he did not subjectively intend to enter”[^16].

27     On the facts of this case, the only piece of evidence that is relevant to show the existence of such “a meeting of minds” on the supply of manpower by the Plaintiff or such “unqualified acceptance” by the Defendant for the Plaintiff’s supply of manpower surfaced by the Plaintiff is Mr Coney’s WhatsApp message to Mr Singh of 4 April 2019 (“_Buddy what time can the guys come in tomorrow to start work on the Movecat system?”_)[^17].

28     A perusal of the relevant chain of WhatsApp messages show that Mr Coney had said, “Hey Ted. The riggers need to come back. So we can change the angles.” In response to this instruction from Mr Coney, Mr Singh’s reply was, “Okay Wadi my main Rigger and the guys will be in tomorrow at 9am he will look for you”.[^18]

29     A perusal of the chain of WhatsApp messages show to me that the instructions from Mr Coney was in relation to work on the Movecat system. In Court, the Plaintiff’s witness Iswadi Bin Razle (the “Wadi” in the WhatsApp messages) who was one of the workers deployed under the supply of manpower for which Tax Invoice 19120.A was issued testified that he was deployed to do miscellaneous or final “touch-up” work such as taping of dangling cables, cleaning etc. on instructions from Mr Singh and not for working on the Movecat system[^19]. The Plaintiff’s representative, Mr Singh also confirmed that there is no connection whatsoever between the WhatsApp message from Mr Coney to Mr Singh of 4 April 2019 and Tax Invoice 19120.A (i.e., the supply of manpower under the said invoice)[^20].

30     I find therefore that the evidence of the WhatsApp messages shows that the discussion between the parties was in relation to the Movecat system. The evidence of the WhatsApp messages does not show that there was a discussion on the supply of manpower and the charges therefor to prepare for the opening of the Marquee. In fact, the Plaintiff’s representative, Mr Singh also conceded that there was no prior negotiations or agreement on the supply of manpower to prepare for the opening of the Marquee prior to the Tax Invoice 19120.A[^21].

31     On the whole, I find that there was no agreement between the parties for the Plaintiff to supply and charge for manpower to the Defendant to prepare for the opening of the Marquee based on the terms as found in the Tax Invoice 19120.A. Applying the principles as stated above to the facts, I find that there is no objective evidence to show that the Defendant has requested the Plaintiff to provide or supply the manpower and that the Plaintiff has also failed to specify a precise point in time when the alleged agreement for the supply of manpower materialised. There is therefore was no _consensus ad idem_ between the parties regarding the supply of manpower to form the basis for the Plaintiff’s claim under Tax Invoice 19120.A.

32     In the circumstances, the Plaintiff’s claim in relation to Tax Invoice 19120.A fails as the Plaintiff has not established that there is a contractual basis or an agreement between the parties that entitles the Plaintiff to be paid in accordance with the said invoice.

### The Defendant’s Counterclaim

#### In Respect of Milos Truss Works

33     The parties agreed for the Plaintiff to supply, deliver, and install milos trusses at the Project site in December 2018. Pursuant to this agreement, the Plaintiff’s representative, Mr Singh sent to the Defendant the Milos Truss Quotation on 21 December 2018 by email[^22]. On 28 December 2018, the Defendant’s representative, Mr Coney replied by email followed with a WhatsApp message with the Defendant’s approval based on the Milos Truss Quotation[^23]. On 29 December 2018, the Plaintiff issued Tax Invoice No. 18128 to the Defendant in respect of the works to be performed pursuant to the Milos Truss Quotation.[^24] For this Tax Invoice No.18128, the Defendant made half payments in 2 instalments on 7 January 2019 and 4 March 2019.[^25]

34     In its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim Amendment No. 1, the Plaintiff admitted as follows: “\[T\]he Milos Trusses that were supplied, delivered and installed at the Project site were not matte black as specified in the Milos Truss Quotation but were silver in colour...”[^26] In cross-examination, the Plaintiff’s representative, Mr Singh also confirmed that it was the Plaintiff’s contractual responsibility to deliver black trusses[^27]

35     Thus, it is not in dispute that the contractual requirement is that the Plaintiff would deliver and install trusses that are matte black in colour. It is also not in dispute that the trusses delivered and installed by the Plaintiff were silver in colour.

36     For this reason, the Defendant says that it is entitled to damages as the Plaintiff had breached its contractual obligations in failing to provide matt black trusses. The Defendant further alleges that there was a delay in the delivery of the Milos Trusses.

37     In response, the Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant had been fully aware that the milos trusses were silver in colour and not matte black as specified but had accepted the trusses without any issue. The Plaintiff submits that the Defendant’s allegation of breach is a belated issue that is raised as an afterthought. The Plaintiff further submits that the Defendant has failed to adduce any contemporaneous documentary evidence to show that the Defendant had been concerned that the trusses were not matte black.

38     Arising from the positions of the parties, the question as to whether the Plaintiff had breached its contractual obligations regarding the Milos Truss Works will depend on my findings on the related issue of whether the parties had agreed to the contract variation from matte black trusses to silver trusses (i.e., whether the Defendant had accepted the variation from matte black trusses to silver trusses).

##### (1)   Whether the parties had agreed to a contract variation from matt black trusses to silver trusses

39     The evidence adduced by the Plaintiff shows that the Defendant was informed that the trusses were silver in colour but had nevertheless instructed the Plaintiff to proceed to install the silver trusses. The contemporaneous evidence also shows that on 28th February 2019, after the silver trusses were installed, the Defendant’s representative, Mr Coney had sent WhatsApp messages to the Plaintiff’s representative, Mr Singh saying, “Good stuff” and “… thanks Ted … \[You’re\] doing a good job, buddy” in response to the pictures and videos showing that the milos trusses had been installed on the Project site sent by Mr Singh.[^28] The Defendant’s representative, Mr Coney conceded that his text messages to the Plaintiff’s representative shows the Defendant’s satisfaction with the Milos Truss Works performed by the Plaintiff.[^29] Mr Coney also conceded that that “(_the Defendant)_ didn’t raise an objection at the time”[^30]

40     The evidence therefore shows that the Defendant’s representative, Mr Coney had accepted delivery of the silver trusses. Upon the acceptance of the delivery of the silver trusses by the Defendant through its representative, the contract variation from matt black trusses to silver trusses is deemed to have been accepted by the Defendant by its conduct.

41     In addition, after the installation of the trusses, the Defendant had proceeded to make the second half payment for the trusses on 4 March 2019 without raising any issue as regards the colour of the trusses.

42     In cross-examination, the Defendant’s representative, Mr Coney conceded that the contemporaneous evidence shows the Defendant has accepted the milos trusses despite the trusses not being in matte black colour[^31].

43     Therefore, based on the conduct of the Defendant, I find that the Defendant had accepted the variation or change in the Plaintiff’s contractual obligation to deliver and install matte black trusses to that of silver trusses. The Defendant cannot retract its acceptance of the change to now allege breach of contract as an afterthought.

44     After the installation of the trusses, Mr Coney informed the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh that cladding works would have to be carried out to cover the turns of the milos trusses in accordance with MBS’s requirements[^32] and requested the Plaintiff for a quotation for the cladding of the milos trusses.[^33] Pursuant to this, Mr Singh sent a quotation for cladding via WhatsApp message to Mr Coney, but Mr Coney decided that cladding was too expensive.[^34] Mr Coney asked Mr Singh for a cheaper alternative to the proposed cladding of the milos trusses. It was in response to this that parties eventually agreed to the solution of wrapping or covering the trusses with black fabric. Thereafter, on 29 March 2019, the Plaintiff issued a quotation for the black fabric - Quotation No. 2019- 19140-PP-Black-JC (“the Black Fabric Quotation”)[^35] which was sent to Mr Coney via WhatsApp on 31st March 2019.[^36] The Plaintiff then issued Tax Invoice No. 19118 pursuant to the Black Fabric Quotation on 2nd April 2019, and the Defendant made payment of S$10,432.50 pursuant to this invoice on 29th April 2019.[^37]

45     From the chronology of events, I find that the Black Fabric Quotation was the result of a separate requirement for the cladding of the trusses and not the result of the Plaintiff’s failure to deliver the trusses in matte black.

46     The Defendant has also not adduced any evidence to show that MBS had required the cladding because the trusses installed were not matte black in colour. Therefore, the available evidence does not contradict the Plaintiff’s position that cladding of the trusses would have been required regardless of the colour of the trusses. As the onus is on the Defendant to prove breach by the Plaintiff and that it has suffered damages arising therefrom, the absence of any evidence to show that the Black Fabric Quotation was to remedy the Plaintiff’s failure to deliver and install matte black trusses means that even if I were to find that there was no acceptance of the contract variation from matte black trusses to silver trusses by the Defendant and the Defendant is entitled to damages, the Defendant has nevertheless not shown that the sum of S$10,432.50 in the Black Fabric Quotation was damages suffered by the Defendant due to the Plaintiff’s breach.

#### In Respect of Movecat Hoist Works

47     The Defendant’s case against the Plaintiff in respect of the Movecat Hoist Works is that the Plaintiff’s installation works for the Movecat Hoist Works Quotation (2018-8136-PP-MC-MQ.3) was unsafe, and that the Plaintiff was contractually required under the Movecat Hoist Works Quotation to carry out a structural vetting of the grid and by failing to do so, the Plaintiff was in breach. The Defendant further alleges that due to the Plaintiff’s failure to carry out the configuring, testing, and commissioning of the entire grid, the Defendant had incurred losses by paying ISOTeam (ISOTeam TMG’s invoice No. Q902732 dated 5th July 2019) the sum of S$4,601.00[^38] and paying Arup (Arup’s Tax Invoice No. 26772) the sum of S$42,000 (before GST)[^39] to do the necessary testing and produce a report to confirm the structural integrity and safety of the Movecat Hoist Works.

48     There are altogether three iterations of Quotations in respect of the Movecat Hoist Works (Quotation Nos. 2018-8136-PP-MC-MQ.1, 2018-8136-PP-MC-MQ.2, 2018-8136-PP-MC-MQ.3). According to the Plaintiff’s representative, Mr Singh, by the third iteration which was the Movecat Hoist Quotation (Quotation No. 2018-8136-PP-MC-MQ.3), the Plaintiff’s scope of works was limited to the supply of hoists and the flying in of a Movecat operator in March 2019 to programme the hoist system.[^40]

49     Before I can make a finding as to whether there was a breach by the Plaintiff as alleged by the Defendant, I will first have to examine what the agreed scope of works entails.

##### (1)   What was the agreed scope of works in respect of the Movecat Hoist Quotation?

50     There are altogether 13 items in the Movecat Hoist Quotation. In Court, the Plaintiff’s representative, Mr Singh has testified what the thirteen items in the Quotation entail[^41]. With regard to Items 12 and 13 of the Movecat Hoist Quotation which are the pertinent items that are in dispute, Mr Singh described as follows:

> Item 12 (“equipment assembly”) refers only to bringing the Movecat Hoists up to the roof of the Marquee and assembling the power cables thereto[^42]

> Item 13 (“System configuration, testing and commissioning”) refers to the configuration, testing and commissioning of the Movecat Hoist System which includes testing that the fail-safe emergency stop system for the Movecat Hoists was working[^43]. According to Mr Singh, “(the Plaintiff’s) job scope was very simple. Whatever we put on the grid we got it endorsed by MOM and by our civil engineers” and that, “**_The whole entire grid was not part of \[our\] job scope at all_**” as “(the Plaintiff) are not the structural engineers”. According to Mr Singh, “**_it was the Defendant’s responsibility to engage the Project’s structural engineers to test and certify the safety for the full grid and the whole structure_**”; the Plaintiff’s responsibility is only for whatever the Plaintiff has put on the grid and for that, the Plaintiff has shown that they have fulfilled their obligations as their Professional Engineer has certified that the equipment that they have put on the grid is safe and they have also obtained MOM’s certification[^44].

(emphasis mine)

51     In cross-examination, Mr Singh maintained that the inspection and endorsement of the entire grid “was never part of \[the Plaintiff’s\] job scope”[^45]. Mr Singh also pointed out that the Professional Engineer Mr M. Sivakumaran had indicated in his endorsed drawings the words “GRID \[check by others for provided weight\]”[^46]. Mr Singh explained that “check by others” refers to the fact that the Defendant was to engage engineers to check the grid after all the work had been completed. The Plaintiff’s position is that, by producing the said Professional Engineer’s certifications of the Plaintiff’s works, the Plaintiff has fulfilled its contractual obligations under the Movecat Hoist Quotation[^47].

52     When questioned about the “other equipment” that were also installed onto the grid in addition to the Movecat Hoists, Mr Singh named these as the “other equipment” that fall outside of the Plaintiff’s responsibility – the cable management system, the power cables for the truss lighting, the disco ball, the air-con piping and ducts with items like the air-con piping and ducts being already on the grid before the Plaintiff carried out its works under the Movecat Hoist Quotation [^48].

53     In contrast, the Defendant has not adduced any expert evidence as to the interpretation of the Movecat Hoist Quotation or as to what “configuring, testing and commissioning” of Movecat Hoists would generally entail. All that the Defendant has is Mr Coney’s bare assertion in his affidavit of evidence in chief[^49] and in Court[^50]. In cross-examination, Mr Coney conceded that item 13 of the Movecat Hoist Quotation (i.e., “system configuration testing and commissioning”) does not expressly state configuring, testing, and commissioning “for the grid”[^51].

54     It was only when the Plaintiff chased for payment for Tax Invoice Nos. 19117 and 19120.A on 27th May 2019 that the Defendant’s Mr Coney told the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh that the delay in payment was due to MBS’s requirement to have “the whole system signed off” and that “We (i.e., the Defendant) are chasing the drawings down”[^52] . This was the first time the certification of the grid cropped up. When Mr Coney requested the Plaintiff to get the Professional Engineer to amend his certification, Mr Singh replied, “\[o\]kay then this is extra work and a new quote will be given for it as this is and was not part of job scop \[sic\], we have all ready \[sic\] given the PE for all our rigging and work done on the grip \[sic., i.e., “grid”\]”[^53].

55     Therefore, unlike the Plaintiff’s stand that is supported by the detailed explanation of what item 13 entails by Mr Singh, the Defendant’s stand is but a bare assertion that is not supported by any technical evidence or evidence by an expert[^54]. The Defendant’s stand is also not supported by the contemporaneous WhatsApp messages which show that the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh had made it clear that the certification of the grid was not part of the scope.

##### (2)   Whether the Plaintiff had breached the contract in relation to the Movecat Hoist Works

56     Based on the foregoing, I therefore find that the Defendant has failed to establish that the scope of the Movecat Hoist Quotation includes the certification of the grid. As I have found that the Plaintiff’s scope of work did not include certification of the structural safety of the grid, even assuming that the Plaintiff had failed to provide such certification and assurance of the safety of the grid that supports the Movecat Hoist, it nonetheless is not a breach by the Plaintiff.

57     Be that as it may, the burden falls on the Defendant to prove that there is a breach by the Plaintiff. In this connection, I find that the Defendant has failed to establish breach by the Plaintiff for these further reasons.

58     First, the photographic evidence[^55] that the Defendant relies on as evidence of breach is hearsay evidence as the photographs were allegedly taken by MBS, but the Defendant has not called the maker of the photographs to give evidence on the photographs. In addition, there is no statement or any explanation as to what evidence the photographs were intended to show[^56]. As such, the photographs are inadmissible evidence, and no findings can be made on them.

59     Second, the minutes of meeting between MBS and representatives of various contractors on 19 July 2019 which allegedly showed that the “\[r\]igging points were not secured properly to the existing grid system and steel rope were wrapped around the square hollow section which is unsafe”[^57] constitute inadmissible hearsay evidence as the Defendant has not called any witness to prove the truth of what was said or discussed at the said meeting, let alone prove that the works carried out by the Plaintiff was unsafe and that there was therefore a breach by the Plaintiff.

60     In _Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 3 SLR(R) 769</span>; <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGCA 20</span> (“_Jet Holdings_”) at \[44\] and \[76\], Phang JA stated as follows:

> “44 … However, it must be emphasised that whilst formal proof of the documents concerned is dispensed with by an agreed bundle of documents, the truth of their contents will still have to be proved in the absence of any agreement or admission to the contrary. …”

> …

> 76    It is trite law that even where there is an agreed bundle of documents, the _truth_ of the contents of the Documents nevertheless remains at issue and is subject to, _inter alia_, objections centring on the doctrine of hearsay.”

(emphasis in italics in original)

61     The Defendant’s reliance on the minutes of meeting of 19 July 2019 to prove the truth of the minutes, i.e., that the grid was unsafe, is therefore misconceived.

62     The Defendant has also not called any witness from ISOTeam or Arup that were eventually paid by the Defendant to test and verify the safety of the grid to give evidence on the cause of the Defendant having to incur additional costs to vet the safety of the grid[^58]. In fact, the Defendant’s representative and only witness was not even present at that said meeting on 19 July 2019.

63     The burden falls on the Defendant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the Plaintiff has breached the contract in relation to the Movecat Hoist Works in failing to carry out the Movecat Hoist Works in a good and workmanlike manner as it had failed to ensure that its installation was structurally safe. As the Defendant has failed to establish that the structural safety of the grid falls within the Plaintiff’s scope of works and as the Defendant has also failed to establish that the structure was unsafe as alleged, I find that the Defendant has failed to discharge this burden of proof.

#### In Respect of PE Certification of Movecat Hoist Works

64     This is in respect of the Quotation 2019-19129PP-PE Certification for Motors & Accessories of 19 February 2019 (“the PE Certification for Movecat Hoist Works Quotation”)[^59] for the Plaintiff to obtain certifications from a Professional Engineer (“PE”) registered with the Ministry of Manpower Singapore (“MOM”). The Defendant’s case of breach by the Plaintiff is that the Plaintiff had failed to procure MOM certificates with the correct ownership details in that the MOM certificates are in the name of ISOTeam instead of MBS. The Plaintiff’s response is that it was the Defendant that had directed the Plaintiff to obtain the details for the ownership registration from ISOTeam and as a result, the certification was obtained based on the details in the Certificate of Factory Registration[^60] as provided by ISOTeam to the Plaintiff. Pursuant to this engagement, on 8 May 2019, the Plaintiff provided the Defendant with the certifications issued by PE Tan Eng Seng on 16th March 2019.[^61]

65     The relevant term that is alleged by the Defendant to have been breached by the Plaintiff states as follows: _“To provide testing services and MOM certificate for Owner’s WLL: 1/2 ton motorised chain hoist c/w 30 meter load chain”_. According to the Quotation, there are 39 items to be tested and certified by MOM certificates. At the per unit price of $620, the total price for this item in the Quotation is $24,180 before GST.

66     While the word, “Owner” was used in the Quotation, the Defendant did not lead any evidence to show that the understanding between the parties is for the MOM certificates to be issued in the name of MBS.

67     In Court, the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh testified that in certifying the motors and accessories pertaining to the Movecat Hoist Works, the PE would examine the factory registration details of the Project (as stated in the Certificate of Factory Registration)[^62] and register the name of the entity listed as “_owner of factory_” in the Certificate of Factory Registration as the owner of the equipment in the MOM certification.[^63] Based on this, the PE who had reviewed the relevant documents had certified the Movecat Hoist Works accordingly. The Plaintiff’s Mr Singh testified that he was not in a position and had no authority to request the PE to modify the PE’s certification.[^64] To do so, the equipment would have to be taken down for the PE’s re-examination.[^65]

68     In contrast, other than a bare allegation from the Defendant, the Defendant has not adduced any evidence to show how or why the Defendant is alleging that the Plaintiff has breached its contractual obligation or has breached its duty of care to ensure the certificate with the correct ownership details are issued. In Court, the Defendant’s Mr Coney acknowledged that he has no information or knowledge about the certification application process or what it entails [^66].

69     Further, as the Defendant was the Project Manager, it is reasonable to infer that it was the Defendant’s obligation to provide the correct details to the Plaintiff for the certification. The evidence shows that the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh had taken reasonable steps to ensure proper certification as he had requested for the details for the certification from the Defendant’s Mr Coney and it was Mr Coney who had directed him to obtain the necessary details from ISOTeam. Based on this, I find that the erroneous certification for the Movecat Hoist Works was due to the fault of the Defendant in the performance of its role as the Project Manager in failing to provide the Plaintiff with the correct information and not the fault of the Plaintiff. In fact, the evidence of the WhatsApp conversation between the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh and the Defendant’s Mr Coney clearly shows that by 22 May 2019, the Defendant’s Mr Coney was himself aware that the ownership details could only be changed after incurring much more costs and he was not in favour of changing the ownership details.[^67]

70     The Plaintiff’s evidence shows that the Plaintiff first received notice of ISOTeam’s objections to the inspection and certification process on 7th August 2019[^68]. Thereafter, after the Plaintiff’s reply to ISOTeam on 20th August 2019, nothing further was heard from ISOTeam[^69]. It is also not disputed that the Marquee nightclub was in full operation since its opening on 12th April 2019 until its closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic measures.[^70]

71     Therefore, even if I were to accept that the MOM certificates were wrong, the Defendant has not shown that the wrong certification has led to or caused any losses to the Defendant. The Defendant also has not adduced any evidence to show that the Defendant has had to obtain a re-certification from the PE or from another PE because of the wrong certification. Based on this, even assuming that the Plaintiff was in breach in failing to obtain the necessary PE certification with the correct ownership details, the Defendant has not shown that the Defendant has suffered any damages arising from such breach.

72     When a breach of a term of contract is established, the non-defaulting party is entitled to claim for damages it has suffered. The amount of damages the non-defaulting party is entitled to is damages such as to put the non-defaulting party back to the position as if the breach had not occurred. The non-defaulting party is not entitled to a refund for the services rendered unless the non-defaulting party can show that the breach is a fundamental breach of either a condition of the contract or a beach that deprives the non-defaulting party of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended by the parties that the non-defaulting should obtain from the contract. In this case, this is not the pleaded position of the Defendant. In addition, the Defendant also has not shown that the breach in relation to the certificates being issued in the wrong ownership name is such a breach as to entitle the Defendant to a refund for services already rendered.

73     Therefore, even assuming there was a breach in relation to the PE certification for the Movecat Hoist Works, there is still no basis for the Defendant to take the position that it is entitled to a refund of the amount paid (i.e., the amount of $24,180 before GST).

#### In Respect of PE Certification of Supporting System

74     This is in relation to Quotation 2019-19128-PP-PE Certification Supporting System (“PE Certification Supporting System Quotation”) for the “Certification for Lighting Trusses and Supporting System”[^71]. The Defendant’s case is that the Plaintiff is contractually bound to certify the weight which the anchor point could hold, and that the Plaintiff had failed to provide such certifications as required.

##### (1)   Whether the Plaintiff was bound to provide certification for the weight which the anchor point can hold

75     The PE Certification Supporting System Quotation states, _“_To Carryout Site Inspection, Prepare plans for the support structure for hoist motor, check truss for structural adequacy & to certify the drawings_.”_.

76     In closing submissions, the Defendant pointed to the following averment of the Plaintiff in its pleadings and say that it is not disputed by the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff is contractually bound to certify the weight the anchor point could hold:

> “With respect to the PE Certification of Supporting System, the Plaintiff sent Mr. Jon Coney a copy of the PE Certification for Supporting System (with the weight which the anchor point could hold duly certified by the Professional Engineer) by way of an email dated 22 May 2019.”[^72]

77     I will accept that at face value, there is no dispute that the Plaintiff was contractually bound to certify the weight for which the anchor point could hold. The issue is whether the Defendant has shown that the Plaintiff has breached this contractual obligation in that the Plaintiff had failed to certify the weight for which the anchor point could hold.

78     It is unclear as to what the Defendant’s allegation of breach entails. It would appear that the Defendant’s allegation of breach for this breach is also based on the Plaintiff’s failure to certify the grid. As I have already found in relation to the PE Certification for the Movecat Hoist Works, I also find that the wording of the PE Certification of Supporting System Quotation does not include certification of the grid. Furthermore, other than the evidence of MBS’ facilities management’s non-approval, the Defendant has not adduced any evidence to show that the intention of the parties in this Quotation is for the Plaintiff to certify the grid in addition to the certification for the “Lighting Trusses and Supporting System”.

79     I now move on to the issue of whether the Plaintiff has breached its contractual obligation with regard to the PE Certification Supporting System Quotation.

##### (2)   Whether the Plaintiff has breached its obligation in relation to the PE Certification Supporting System Quotation

80     It is not disputed that the Plaintiff had sent to the Defendant _“_a copy of the PE Certification of Supporting System with the weight which the anchor point could hold duly certified by the Professional Engineer” by way of an email on 22 May 2019[^73]. What is in dispute is whether in providing the said PE Certification on 22 May 2019, the Plaintiff has complied with its contractual obligation.

81     In the said PE certification, the PE had inserted these handwritten annotations – “Grid \[check by others for provided weight\]_”_ and _“_checking By others for provided weight_”_[^74]. The Defendant pointed to such annotations to say that the PE certification was not in compliance with the Plaintiff’s contractual obligation. The Defendant also pointed to the fact that on 27 May 2019, the Defendant’s Mr Coney had informed the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh that MBS’s facilities manager had issues with the PE certification because of the handwritten annotations:

> “It’s the grid. FM want the whole system signed off. We are chasing the drawings down. If I get you the grid cert will he remove the comment (grid by others) and attach what we give you? So his approval is based on the other dipsticks approval? For the grid. That should close it out.”[^75].

82     Therefore, the Defendant’s allegation and evidence of breach is essentially that the Plaintiff did not certify the grid. As the Defendant has not established that certifying the grid was part of the requisite certification based on the parties’ intention and as the Defendant has not adduced any evidence that the Plaintiff has breached the contractual obligation it had undertaken in the PE Certification of Supporting System Quotation, I am not satisfied that this aspect of the Defendant’s counterclaim has been established. The burden lies on the Defendant to show on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff has not fulfilled its obligation under the PE Certification of Supporting System Quotation and that such non-fulfilment entitles the Defendant to a refund of the monies paid. Additionally, as I have found in relation to the PE Certification for the Movecat Hoist Works, in relation to the PE Certification for the Supporting System, another flaw in the Defendant’s case is that the Defendant has not shown what damages, if any, it had suffered because of this breach. Importantly, the Defendant has not shown, and neither was it the Defendant’s pleaded position that the breach was such as to deprive the Defendant of the whole benefit of the PE certification and that by virtue thereof, the Defendant is entitled to a refund of the monies paid for this PE certification.

#### In Respect of Hoist Replacement Works

83     Due to the Water Damage Incident, the Defendant engaged the Plaintiff to carry out the replacement of the Movecat Hoist system on 14 March 2019. Arising from such engagement, the Plaintiff rendered the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation[^76] as follows:

> \* _Amounts are exclusive of 7% GST_

84     It is not disputed that the amount eventually charged by the Plaintiff and paid by the Defendant for the Hoist Replacement Works is $165,668.75 as item 4 was not required and $7000 was deducted from the payment due under the invoices issued for the Hoist Replacement Works[^77].

85     The Defendant’s counterclaim in relation to the Hoist Replacement Works is in relation to the alleged failure to carry out or complete the Hoist Replacement Works in that items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation were never delivered. It is not disputed that items1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation have not been delivered.

86     In its pleadings, the Plaintiff cited the following reasons for the non-delivery of items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation:

> (a)     the Defendant has not made payment for Tax Invoice No. 19117 and Tax Invoice 19120.A[^78];

> (b)     MBS had claimed “ownership” of the replacement hoists and given _“_verbal instruction to the Plaintiff not to release these items to the Defendant_”_[^79]

> (c)     the delivery of items 1 and 3 is contingent on the Defendant arranging for the delivery and installation and the Defendant had failed or refused to inform the Plaintiff regarding when items 1 and 3 can be installed at the Project site[^80].

87     The Plaintiff thus says that the Defendant’s request for the delivery of items 1 and 3 on 13 June 2019 was belated and an afterthought[^81]. The Plaintiff further avers that installation of items 1 and 3 would require the Marquee to be shut down until after the replacement hoist has been installed.

88     Arising from the Plaintiff’s response, the issue for my determination is whether the Plaintiff has breached the Replacement Hoist Works Quotation in failing to deliver items 1 and 3 of the said Quotation.

##### (1)   Whether the Plaintiff has breached the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation in failing to deliver items 1 and 3 of the said Quotation

89     It is not disputed that the Plaintiff had not delivered items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation[^82]. It is also not disputed that the Defendant has paid up in full in relation to the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation. The Plaintiff’s Mr Singh has alleged that items 1 and 3 remain in the Plaintiff’s warehouse[^83]. However, in cross-examination, Mr Singh conceded that he has not adduced any evidence to prove this allegation[^84].

90     The evidence shows that when the Defendant queried the Plaintiff about the delivery of items 1 and 3 by an email on 13 June 2019, the Defendant had already fully paid for the Hoist Replacement Works. The Plaintiff has relied on the non-payment of Tax Invoice No. 19117 and Tax Invoice 19120.A by the Defendant as justification for the non-delivery of items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation. As already stated above, it should be noted that these two invoices (Tax Invoice No. 19117 and Tax Invoice 19120.A) are unrelated to the Replacement Hoist Works Quotation.

91     As stated by the High Court in _Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v. Ann Lee Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 288</span> (“_Jia Min Building_”) at \[55\]

> It appears to be settled law that a contractor/sub-contractor has no general right at common law to suspend work unless this is expressly agreed upon. This is so even if payment is wrongly withheld:...

92     This principle is applied and further clarified in _Goh Eng Lee Andy v. Yeo Jin Kow_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 292</span> at \[50\] as follows:

> Moreover, the defendant had no general right in law to suspend work even if payment was wrongfully withheld unless the parties had expressly conferred such a right on the defendant or it could be established that the delay in payment made it not possible for the defendant to continue with the contract works (see _Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 288</span> at \[55\]–\[57\] and \[65\]).

93     As enunciated by Quentin Loh JAD in the Court of Appeal case _Diamond Glass Enterprise Pte Ltd v. Zhong Kai Construction Co Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 61</span> at \[96\], the rationale for this principle of law is clear –

> “... This was made clear in _Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 288</span> (‘Jia Min’) at \[55\], where the court stated, citing _Lubenham Fidelities and Investments Co Ltd v South Pembrokeshire District Council_ (1986) 33 BLR 46: ‘\[i\]t appears settled law that a contractor/subcontractor has no general right at common law to suspend work unless this is expressly agreed upon. This is so even if payment is wrongly withheld’. The court also cited Halsbury’s Law of Singapore, vol 2 (LexisNexis Singapore, 2003 Reissue) at para 30.321, Keating on Building Contracts (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th ed, 2001) at para 6-96 and Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts, vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 11th ed, 1995) at para 4-223 for the same principle. **_The rationale for this, the court explained, was that ‘the existence of such a right \[to suspend work upon the other party’s failure to make payment\] could create chaos within the building industry if contractors were to muscle their way through disputes with threats or actual threats or suspension instead of having their disputes adjudicated’_** (at \[57\]).” (emphasis mine)

94     Therefore, the law is clear. The Plaintiff does not have the legal right to withhold the delivery of items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation by reason only of the Defendant’s non-payment of some other unrelated invoices. The Defendant is entitled to insist on the Plaintiff’s performance of its obligations under the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation for which the Defendant has already paid. The Plaintiff’s failure to carry out its contractual obligations thereunder amounts to a breach on the part of the Plaintiff for which the Defendant is entitled to claim damages.

95     As for the Plaintiff’s allegation that MBS has claimed ownership over the replacement hoists, that also does not accord the Plaintiff with a valid defence as the Plaintiff owes its contractual obligations to the Defendant under the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation and not to MBS. A breach of the contractual obligations thereunder by the Plaintiff entitles the Defendant to claim for damages arising from such a breach.

96     As for the Plaintiff’s position that its obligation to complete the works under the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation was contingent on the Defendant’s arrangement for the delivery and installation of the equipment, I find that there is no such condition stated in the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation. In re-examination, the Defendant’s Mr Coney clarified that it is the Plaintiff’s job to fill up a form for submission to MBS to arrange for the delivery of the replacement hoist[^85].

97     In fact, the evidence shows that when the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh asked the Defendant’s Mr Coney “what time can the guys come in tomorrow to start work on the Movecat system”, Mr Coney had replied, “Anytime it’s urgent work”[^86]. In Mr Coney’s email to Mr Singh of 19 June 2019, the Defendant had in fact asked for proof that the replacement hoist had been ordered and were already in Singapore[^87]. In that email, it is also clear that the Defendant had alleged that the Plaintiff had not completed the works that the Plaintiff had been fully paid for and that the Plaintiff had failed to deliver over $150,000 worth of equipment[^88]. Prior to this email of 19 June 2019, on 13 June 2019, the Defendant had also sent an email to the Plaintiff questioning, “The delivery of the new move cat hoists, where are they? A lot of the items above have been paid in full in which we have not received the goods for..._”_[^89] In the email of 19 June 2019, the Defendant had demanded that, “We require the 5 new move cat (and accessories as per the above quote) and the two chain master’s delivered within 7 days or further action will be taken against your company.”[^90] In response to this demand, the Plaintiff did not ask the Defendant to arrange for the delivery and installation of the equipment. Instead, the Plaintiff’s response was to demand that the Defendant pay the balance payment for the outstanding but unrelated invoices[^91].

98     Therefore, it is clear to me that when the Defendant asked for delivery and installation of the replacement hoists, the Plaintiff did not ask for the Defendant to arrange for the delivery and installation. The Plaintiff’s response was to demand for payment of the two outstanding invoices 19117 and 19120.A. This was also admitted by the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh in cross-examination[^92].

99     Even assuming that the Plaintiff’s version is correct – that after the official opening of the Marquee, the Marquee had to be “shut down” in order for the Plaintiff to install the replacement hoists and to carry out the works in the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation, by Mr Singh’s own admission, it would take only “\[a\]bout 2 to 3 days” to install the hoists[^93]. There is therefore no reason why the Plaintiff could not have requested for this to complete the works under the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation for which the Plaintiff had already been paid given that the Marquee is only open on Fridays and Saturdays and public holidays[^94]. Be that as it may, the fact is that there is no evidence whatsoever that the Plaintiff had even requested for the Marquee to be shut down in order for the replacement hoists to be installed[^95].

100    Based on all of the above, I find that the Plaintiff’s defence that the delivery and installation of the replacement hoist could not be done because of the Defendant’s failure to make the necessary arrangement to be but mere excuses or an afterthought.

101    I therefore find that the Plaintiff is in breach or in repudiatory breach of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation.

##### (2)   If the Plaintiff has breached the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation, what damages would the Defendant be entitled to?

102    The law on damages for breach of contract is clear. As stated by Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in the High Court case of _Loh Chiang Tien & Anor v. Saman Dharmatilleke_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 45</span> (“_Loh Chiang Tien_”) at \[22\]:

> “The _prima facie_ measure of damages in contract is as follows: “where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed” (_Robinson v Hartman_ (1848) 1 Exch 850 at 855). Where a promisor’s breach has caused the promisee to lose something that the promisee would have gained _but for the breach_, the promisee’s loss is _prima facie_ the value of the benefit that the promisor failed to deliver or provide. This is known as the promisee’s expectation loss.”

103    Since the Defendant has paid for items 1 and 3 which were undisputedly not delivered, the damages suffered by the Defendant is the amount the Defendant has paid for items 1 and 3. The Defendant’s loss is prima facie the value of the benefit that the Plaintiff failed to deliver or provide.

104    Alternatively, the Defendant’s counterclaim in relation to the Hoist Replacement Works is also based on restitution by reason of unjust enrichment and because of “money had and received” but there was a total failure of consideration.

105    In closing submissions, the Defendant cited the High Court case of _Comfort Management Pte Ltd v. OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 165</span> (“_Comfort Management_”) and says that the Defendant’s counterclaim for the sums paid under the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation is “uncontroversial”:

> “16    ... However, where a contractor alleges that a subcontractor failed to complete works contracted under a lump sum contract and has therefore been paid more than its contractual entitlement to be paid, the court must undertake an objective assessment of the proportion of the works which the subcontractor did in fact complete in order to ascertain the actual extent of the subcontractor’s contractual entitlement to be paid.

> …

> 18    It is uncontroversial that a contractor is entitled to recover an overpayment from a subcontractor under a lump sum contract, provided that the contractor is able to satisfy the court that the amount paid was not in fact contractually commensurate with the actual work done (see _Mansource Interior Pte Ltd v CSG Group Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 203</span>).”

106    In addition to the non-delivery of items 1 and 3 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation, the Plaintiff has also conceded that Item 5 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation (MOM testing of the replacement hoists) was not carried out and that the sum of $4,340.00 (exclusive of 7% GST) should be set-off against the Plaintiff’s claim[^96]. In Court, the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh also candidly admitted that, “because (the Plaintiff) never installed the 5 hoists, so (the Plaintiff) never got to the MOM operator to come in to do the installation of the 5 hoists and the testing of the 5 hoists”[^97].

107    The same goes for Item 6 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation (for rigging and re-installation of hoist)[^98]. Since the replacement hoists were not delivered, there was no rigging and re-installation of the replacement hoists thereof.

108    Similarly, in relation to item 7 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation, as the replacement hoist were never delivered, there could be no testing and commissioning of the replacement hoist[^99]. This was also acknowledged by the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh during cross-examination[^100]. Mr Singh however stressed that the Plaintiff had still gone ahead to do testing and commissioning with respect to the processor to check that the processor is working in relation to the hoists that had been installed[^101]. As the Plaintiff’s entitlement to charges in the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation is in relation to the replacement hoists, the Plaintiff’s position that it is entitled to payment for item 7 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation in relation to the original hoists already installed is misconceived. In any event, the Plaintiff’s Mr Singh did eventually acknowledge during cross-examination that the Plaintiff was not entitled to claim for item 7 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation[^102] .

109    Item 8 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation is for “Shipping of Items to Singapore by AIR”. As the replacement hoists were not delivered, by the same token as for other works that were not done in relation to the replacement hoists, the Defendant is similarly not liable to pay for item 8 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation in respect of the shipping costs for the replacement hoists.

110    Therefore, based on an objective assessment of the proportion of the works that is in fact completed by the Plaintiff in relation to the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation, I find that the actual extent of the Plaintiff’s contractual entitlement to be paid is for item 2 only which the Defendant is not claiming for in its counterclaim.

111    Alternatively, as I have found the Plaintiff to be in repudiatory breach of the contract in relation to the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation, the Defendant is entitled to elect to accept the Plaintiff’s breach and claim for damages arising from such repudiatory breach. In addition, as the Defendant has been deprived of substantially the whole benefit of the contract in the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation given that the Plaintiff had failed to deliver 6 out of the 7 items that have been charged to the Defendant, the Defendant is also entitled to rescind the contract and seek a refund of the payments made under the contract (see Court of Appeal in _San International Pte Ltd v Keppel Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 447</span> at \[25\]).

112    In addition, the Defendant has pleaded that it is entitled to claim the overpayment in respect of the replacement hoists that were never delivered for failure of consideration and/or as money had and received arising from the unjust enrichment of the Plaintiff at the Defendant’s expense in respect of payments which the Plaintiff should not have charged or which the Defendant should not have paid or had mistakenly paid[^103].

113    The law on unjust enrichment is as stated by the Court of Appeal in _Benzline Auto Pte Ltd v. Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 239</span> (“_Benzline Auto_”) at \[45\]:

> “The three requirements of a claim in unjust enrichment are (a) enrichment of the (plaintiff), (b) at the expense of the (defendant), and (c) circumstances which make the enrichment unjust (i.e., the presence of an ‘unjust factor’)”

114    On the facts of this case, as it is not disputed that the replacement hoists were not delivered, it is clear to me that the Plaintiff had been enriched at the expense of the Defendant since the Plaintiff had received money from the Defendant in respect of works which were not carried out. As for the “unjust factor”, the Court of Appeal in _Benzline Auto_ found “failure of consideration” to be synonymous with failure of basis for unjust enrichment (\[46\]):

> “…The core underlying idea of failure of basis is simple: a benefit has been conferred on the joint understanding that the recipient’s right to retain it is conditional. If the condition is not fulfilled, the recipient must return the benefit….”

115    As there was a failure of consideration in so far as payment for the replacement hoists that were never delivered are concerned, the basis on which the Defendant had made payment for the five replacement hoists that were not delivered had failed and the unjust factor is established.

116    In the circumstances, the Defendant is entitled to a refund of the payments made for the items in the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation that were not delivered or not performed.

117    Alternatively, the Defendant’s counterclaim is also based on a total failure of consideration. With regard to this, where a contract is divisible such that it can be said that there has been a total failure of the consideration for/basis of a discrete part of that contract, the failure of consideration can be considered as total in respect of the discrete parts not delivered: see _Benzline Auto_ at \[53\].

118    In this case, the contract between the parties is split into different quotations and in each quotation, the price is further broken down into the price for the different components. As it can be determined as to which parts of the works were carried out and which parts were not, in respect of the parts not delivered or not carried out, there is a total failure of consideration. In fact, the Plaintiff themselves accept the divisibility of the contract as the Plaintiff is prepared to accept that item 5 of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation was not carried out. Therefore, there is a total failure of consideration in respect of the payment made for the five replacement hoists, the rigging and installation, the testing, commissioning thereof, etc., i.e., all items except for item 2 of the Replacement Hoist Works Quotation.

119    Accordingly, the Defendant is also entitled to the payment it had made under the Replacement Hoist Works Quotation except for item 2 thereunder based on a total failure of consideration or unjust enrichment.

120    In conclusion, the Defendant is entitled to be refunded for the sum it had paid for works not delivered or no done, i.e., for items 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 & 8 (in respect of the shipping of the replacement hoists) of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation.

121    In closing submissions, the Defendant submitted that it is entitled to recover the sum of $123,399.94 (inclusive of 7% GST) from the Plaintiff, based on a 10% discount in respect of shipping costs for the Movecat processors that were not disputed to have been delivered. The Defendant’s basis for its position that it should not pay 90% of the shipping costs is because by Mr Singh’s own testimony, the 5 replacement hoists would have accounted for 90% of the shipment weight and costs[^104].

122    I am therefore satisfied with the Defendant’s calculation of damages it has suffered, i.e., based on the payment made for items 1 (five replacement hoists), 3 (load cells), 5 (testing services and MOM certificates), 6 (rigging and re-installation of hoist) and 7 (testing and commissioning) and 90% of item 8 (shipping costs) of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation.

123    I therefore award the Defendant the sum of $123,399.94 as damages it has suffered because of the Plaintiff’s breach or repudiatory breach of the contract in respect of the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation.

#### In Respect of Movecat Operator Quotation

124    In addition to the payments made under the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation, the Defendant had also paid $28,034.00 to the Plaintiff in respect of the Quotation 2019-19135-PP-MOVECAT dated 18 March 2019 (“the Movecat Operator Quotation”)[^105] The Movecat Operator Quotation is for a certified Movecat operator to fly into Singapore to set-up and/or programme the five Movecat replacement hoists that were to have been supplied and delivered under the Hoist Replacement Works Quotation.

125    The Plaintiff has alleged that pursuant to the Movecat Operator Quotation, the Plaintiff had engaged a Mr Jen Kleinenbrands who did come to Singapore to perform various services as contracted in the Movecat Operator Quotation[^106]. It is not disputed that this was carried out in April 2019, i.e., after the Water Damage Incident. As such, the Movecat Operator Quotation must have been in respect of the replacement hoists. In Court, the Defendant’s Mr Coney has also testified that the Movecat Operator Quotation was an additional fee for _“(Mr Jen Kleinenbrands)_ to come out once the water damage hoists were complete, which they were never done.”[^107]

126    In light of my finding that there was a total failure of consideration in respect of the five replacement hoists, by the same token, there is also a total failure of consideration for the Movecat Operator Quotation.

127    Furthermore, the Plaintiff did not call Mr Jen Kleinenbrands to testify as to the services rendered or performed by him. While the two factual witnesses called by the Plaintiff have testified that they had seen Mr Jen Kleinenbrands working at the Project site, they admitted that they had no personal knowledge of what Mr Jen Kleinenbrands was doing[^108]. As such, I am not satisfied that the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff shows that the Plaintiff had performed the services stated in the Movecat Operator Quotation.

128    In the circumstances, the Defendant is entitled to the sum of $28,034.00 based on total failure of consideration or based on “money had and received” under unjust enrichment.

#### In Respect of Plaintiff’s Overcharging in Tax Invoices Nos. 19112, 19114 and 19119

129    The Defendant’s counterclaim for overcharging by the Plaintiff is based on Tax Invoices Nos. 19112 dated 14 March 2019 for the sum of $18,944.78[^109], 19114 dated 25 March 2019 for the sum of $17,580.10[^110] and 19119 dated 2 April 2019 for the sum of $10,700.00[^111]. It is not disputed that the Defendant had made payment under these invoices. The Defendant’s counterclaim seeking for a refund of the total sum of $47,224.88 paid is on the basis that the Plaintiff is not entitled to these payments as these invoices are in relation to the Movecat Hoist Works for which the Defendant has already paid under Invoice Tax No. 19101.

##### (1)   Whether there is overcharging by the Plaintiff in relation to Tax Invoices Nos. 19112, 19114 and 19119

130    According to the Plaintiff, Tax Invoices Nos. 19112, 19114 and 19119 are in relation to the Quotation 2019-19134-PP-Rigging Accessories & Power Cables dated 2 March 2019[^112], Quotation 2019-19136-PP-Movecat-Power, Manpower & Truss dated 25 March 2019[^113] and Quotation 2019-19141-PP-Hoist-Manpower dated 29 March 2019[^114] respectively[^115].

131    A perusal of Quotation 2019-19134-PP-Rigging Accessories & Power Cables dated 2 March 2019 which forms the basis for Tax Invoice No. 19112 shows that the Quotation was for the supply of various rigging and power accessories such as “power cable for chain master hoist” at $2,645.40, “masterlink cable for disco ball” at $400, “32Amp break out to 6 X 16 Amp” at $6000, “2.5mm 3 core power cable 100m” at $500, “3.25 ton bow screw pin shackle c/w MOM certificate” at $1200 and “16mm dia x 1.5m ungalv’d wire rope” at $2975 etc. As for Quotation 2019-19136-PP-Movecat-Power, Manpower & Truss dated 25 March 2019 which forms the basis for Tax Invoices No.19114, the said Quotation shows it is for the supply of power accessories such as “truss adaptor” at $360, “16A 3C X 2.5mm 2y-cord 0.5m sections” at $1800, “milos stv2000 2M triangular truss” at $1680, “milos stv2000 3M triangular truss” at $480, “32A 3Phase 6mm power cables 100m” at $6500 and “working crew 15th to 23rd” at $2250, etc.. In respect of Quotation 2019-19141-PP-Hoist-Manpower dated 29 March 2019, the quotation was described to be for “manpower 2 weeks for Movecat & Chain Master installation” at $10,000 before GST. At broad brush, it appears from the face of these Quotations that the works under the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119 are related to the Movecat Hoist Works and trusses.

132    In Mr Singh’s affidavit of evidence in chief, Mr Singh has testified that the invoices 19112, 19114 & 19119 are invoices in relation to separate quotations which have been approved by the Defendant without question or objection[^116]. However, no further details as to how the Quotations arose and what they were for and what both parties had agreed to in relation to these three Quotations that form the basis for the three invoices in question was provided by Mr Singh in his affidavit of evidence in chief.

133    In cross-examination, Mr Singh acknowledged that the supplies and works under Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119 are “necessary but not only subjected to the Movecat hoist works” as they were also for other aspects of work such as the Plaintiff’s workers “going on at the worksite where (the Plaintiff’s) team help other companies to do their work as well”, for example, “setting up the portable LED wall and the speaker systems”, “hanging the truss system and the chain masters”. In so far as Mr Singh’s testimony that the works under Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119 are partly necessary to the Movecat Hoist Works is concerned, it did not address the issue as to why these are not covered in the Movecat Hoist Works Quotation for which Invoice No. 19101[^117] had been rendered and paid by the Defendant.

134    The Plaintiff had merely relied on payment by the Defendant without question as evidence of its entitlement to its claim under Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119. This is misconceived. As the Plaintiff is enforcing its right under contract, the onus is on the Plaintiff to prove that parties had agreed to the terms as stated in the said Quotations which form the bases for the invoices in question.

135    A perusal of the Movecat Hoist Works Quotation also shows that the Quotation included the supply and installation of the “Movecat motion hoist system” at the lump sum price of $612,000, “equipment assembly” being charged at $9000 and “system configuration, testing and commissioning” being charged at $24,000. On the face of the Movecat Hoist Works Quotation, it would appear to include all works, supplies, and manpower necessary for the installation, assembly, system configuration, testing and commissioning of the Movecat motion hoist system.

136    As the Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to show how and in what aspects Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119 were separate and different from the works, supplies and manpower necessary for the installation, assembly, system configuration, testing and commissioning of the Movecat motion hoist system, by Mr Singh’s own admission in cross-examination that the said invoices were in part necessary for the Movecat Hoist Works, I find that there is at least some overlap between Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119 and Tax Invoice 19101 for the Movecat Hoist Works Quotation.

137    In _Goh Eng Lee Andy v. Yeo Jin Kow_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 292</span> (“_Goh Eng Lee Andy_”), the High Court at \[28\] stated the principle that in the case of a lump sum “design and build” contract, the contractor has to do all that is necessary to achieve the contractual scope of works and there is no recourse for additional payments unless it can be shown that the works undertaken were substantially different from the original scope or that the additional expense came about as a result of the other party’s breach. In the circumstances, in the absence of any evidence to show that the works rendered under Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119 were substantially different from the original scope of works in the respective Quotations for the Movecat Hoist Works and for the Milos Truss Works, the Plaintiff has failed to show that it is entitled to the charges stated therein.

138    I therefore find that the Plaintiff has failed to show that there was any agreement between the parties in the form of Quotation 2019-19134-PP-Rigging Accessories & Power Cables of 2 March 2019, Quotation 2019-19136-PP-Movecat-Power, Manpower & Truss of 25 March 2019 and Quotation 2019-19141-PP-Hoist-Manpower of 29 March 2019 to support the Plaintiff’s claim under Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Plaintiff is not entitled to the charges in Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119.

139    In the circumstances, the Defendant is entitled to a refund of the payment it had made under Tax Invoice Nos. 19112, 19114 & 19119, i.e., the sum of $47,224.88.

## Conclusion

140    In conclusion, the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant is partially allowed in the sum of $22,547.04 and the Defendant’s counterclaim against the Plaintiff is partially allowed in the sum of $198,658.82 ($123,399.94 + $28,034.00 + $47,224.88).

141    As the Defendant’s counterclaim forms the bulk of the substance of this Suit and as the Defendant has been largely successful in its counterclaim against the Plaintiff, my award on costs is for the Plaintiff to pay to the Defendant 75% of the Defendant’s costs in this action, with such costs to be taxed, if not agreed.
