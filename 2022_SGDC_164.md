### District Judge Prem Raj Prabakaran:

## Introduction

1       On 18 January 2017, Child Protection Officers[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) brought a 14-year-old girl (the “Complainant”) to a Neighbourhood Police Centre (the “NPC”) to lodge a report (the “Report”). She was then a Secondary 3 student in a local school (the “School”). The “counter officer” who spoke to her typed the following down in the “Brief details” section of the Report: “A few months ago, I was molested by my step-father”. The officer also stated the “Location of \[the\] Incident” as the flat the Complainant was then staying in (the “Flat”)[^2], with her biological mother (the “Mother”) and her stepfather – the accused.

## Three charges preferred against accused

2       Investigations led to three charges against the accused, for alleged offences in the Flat in 2016. Two charges, punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3), were for using criminal force against the Complainant with the intention to outrage her modesty. The third charge, punishable under s 509 of the Penal Code, was for intruding upon her privacy with the intention to insult her modesty. These alleged offences were purportedly committed in the following order:

3       The Prosecution’s case, based on the charges it preferred, was that the Complainant was 13 years old when the accused committed these offences – _viz_, all the offences were committed before her 14th birthday on 21 December 2016.

4       The charges preferred by the Prosecution read as follows:

5       The accused claimed trial to all three charges.

## Procedural history

6       Ms Grace Malathy Ponnusamy (“Counsel”) and Mr Kalaithasan Karuppaya (collectively, the “Defence”) represented the accused. The accused elected to testify in his own defence. The Defence also called the Mother as its witness.

7       The Prosecution called five witnesses:

8       The Prosecution initially intended to also call Station Inspector Johnny Tan Beng Heng (“SI Tan”). He had recorded statements from the Stepmother and the accused. SI Tan’s attendance was dispensed with when the Defence indicated that it had no questions for him.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

9       Parties filed their reply submissions on 15 September 2020. On 30 September 2020, Counsel filed further reply submissions after leave was given to parties to do so should the reply submissions raise fresh points. The Prosecution did not file any further reply submissions.

10     When proceedings resumed, the Prosecution informed the court that:

> (a)     it was making IO Isak available to testify as Counsel’s further reply submissions contained several allegations relating to the conduct of investigations into the accused’s case. In this regard, the Prosecution invited the court to exercise its discretion under s 283(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) (the “CPC”) to recall and re-examine IO Isak on its own motion. The Prosecution clarified it was not applying to recall IO Isak. It stated that it was “merely highlighting” that IO Isak was ready to testify if the court wished to call him on its own motion.[^6]

> (b)     it had disclosed the following investigation statements to Counsel just before the proceedings to comply with its disclosure obligations under _Muhammad bin Kadar and another v PP_[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) (“_Kadar_”):[^8]

>> (i)       The Complainant’s second statement, which was recorded on 12 April 2017.

>> (ii)       The Stepmother’s statements, which were recorded on 13 February 2018 and 21 February 2018.

11     Counsel objected to IO Isak being recalled. She stressed that “finality of the case \[was\] of paramount importance” and that the Prosecution “shouldn’t be allowed to prosecute in instalments”. She contended that the evidence underlying the issues raised in her further reply submissions was already known to the Prosecution in July/August 2019, when the Complainant, the Stepmother, and the Mother testified. She submitted that the Prosecution’s application thus failed the test in _PP v Bridges Christopher_[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) for the calling of rebuttal evidence. She also submitted that the Prosecution’s “application” was “unprecedented”, “gravely prejudicial”, as well as “a backdoor method and a second or third bite at the cherry”. She stated that the Prosecution’s “couching \[of its\] application” as an invitation to the court was “not fair to say the least”, when it was “very obvious that \[it was\] trying to recall the IO to rebut the evidence or the submissions raised by the Defence”.[^10]

12     The Prosecution responded that it was not applying to recall IO Isak as a rebuttal witness. It explained that it was making IO Isak available to “answer” the issues raised in Counsel’s further reply submissions. While aware of the evidence led on these issues, it explained that it only became aware of the “nature of \[Counsel’s\] allegations” – which bordered on “alleging some form of negligence on the part of the investigation officers” – when it received Counsel’s further reply submissions. All it was doing, according to the Prosecution, was making IO Isak available in case the court had “any questions to clarify…to set the record straight or otherwise”. The Prosecution reiterated that it was not making IO Isak available “to rebut any evidence adduced over the trial”. It stated that it was “still ready to proceed” if IO Isak was not recalled. It also stated that its position was that the “state of investigations” was immaterial to the charges and that it would “stand by” the evidence of the Complainant, its “key witness”. It indicated that even if IO Isak was recalled, his testimony would not buttress the Complainant’s evidence.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

13     In relation to the disclosures of the Complainant and Stepmother’s statements, Counsel stated that she wished to apply to recall and re-examine only the Stepmother. She also stated that she wished to obtain the Mother’s statements from the Prosecution, but conceded that these statements did not “fit squarely” within the Prosecution’s disclosure obligations under _Kadar_ or _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Faud v PP_[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) (“_Nabill_”). Nevertheless, Counsel submitted that if IO Isak was recalled, it would only be “fair” for the Mother’s statements to be disclosed because the Mother had apparently told Counsel that she had informed IO Isak of the availability of certain evidence in her statement of 18 January 2017.[^13]

14     A date was thus fixed for the court to indicate if IO Isak should be recalled under s 283(1) of the CPC. However, Counsel wrote to the Prosecution before this date to seek further disclosure of statements in its possession. Against this backdrop, the Prosecution informed the court that it intended to place the following statements before the court to rule on whether they should be disclosed under _Nabill_ or _Kadar_ (collectively, the “Requested Statements”):[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> (a)     The Complainant’s first statement, which was recorded on 18 January 2017.

> (b)     The statement of the Complainant’s biological father (the “Father”), which was recorded on 12 April 2017.

> (c)     The Mother’s statements, which were recorded on 18 January 2017 and 25 April 2017.

15     I directed the Prosecution to refrain from putting the Requested Statements before the court at this time. I indicated that if Counsel wanted the Prosecution to disclose these statements, she should explain the legal basis for disclosure. And, if the Prosecution resisted disclosure thereafter, it should also explain its basis. Later that same day, Counsel informed the court that the accused had instructed her “not to seek further disclosure of any documents at this juncture”. She maintained her position on the recall of IO Isak and the Mother’s statements.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) The Prosecution subsequently informed the court that it had reviewed the matter and was now of the view that it was “not necessary” for the Requested Statements to be put before the court to rule on their disclosure. When proceedings resumed:

> (a)     the Prosecution stated that it had disclosed the Father’s statement[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) out of an abundance of caution, and not pursuant to its disclosure obligations under _Kadar_ and _Nabill_.[^17]

> (b)     Counsel confirmed that she had reviewed the evidence adduced and was no longer seeking disclosure of the remaining Requested Statements. The accused confirmed this to be his position as well.

> (c)     Counsel confirmed that she wished to apply to recall and re-examine only the Stepmother (and not the Complainant or her Father, whose statements had also been disclosed[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)). Counsel indicated that she wished to admit the Stepmother’s statements under s 259(1)(_a_) of the CPC – _viz_, under s 147 of the Evidence Act.

> (d)     I noted that Counsel’s allegations in her further reply submissions were serious[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) and appeared to go beyond assertions on the non-production of evidence. I clarified with Counsel if she was maintaining these allegations. She confirmed that she was. The accused also confirmed that these allegations were made on his instructions.

> (e)     The Prosecution confirmed that it was ready to proceed even if IO Isak was not recalled on the court’s own motion. It also confirmed that it was not applying to recall IO Isak, notwithstanding the nature of the assertions in Counsel’s further reply submissions.

16     Given the Prosecution’s position on IO Isak’s recall, I declined to recall him on my own motion. That said, I asked the Prosecution to respond to Counsel’s further reply submissions given the gravity of the allegations therein. A hearing was also fixed on 19 February 2021, for the Stepmother to be recalled.

## Charges accused was convicted on

17     I subsequently convicted the accused on the following amended charges:

## Eventual sentences imposed on accused

18     Following his convictions, the accused instructed Mr Suang Wijaya (“DC”) in respect of his sentencing. I later sentenced the accused as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="28.64%"><col width="27.68%"><col width="43.68%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Order/Charge No</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence section</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Eventual sentences imposed</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>1<sup>st</sup> offence, in the Complainant’s bedroom</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-920694-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 354(1), read with s 354(2), of the Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>“Bedroom Incident”</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">19 months’ imprisonment <em>and</em> 3 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>2<sup>nd</sup> offence, in the master bedroom</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-920693-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>“Master Bedroom Incident”</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 months’ imprisonment <em>and</em> 3 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>3<sup>rd</sup> offence, on the sofa in the living room</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-906186-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 509 of the Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>“Sofa Incident”</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 week’s imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total sentence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>32 months’ imprisonment </b><b><em>and </em></b><b>6 strokes of the cane</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

19     The accused appealed against his convictions and sentences. The Prosecution appealed against the sentences. The execution of these sentences was stayed pending the hearing of these appeals, and the accused remains on bail. These are my grounds of decision. I start by setting out the facts that were not disputed during the trial. I then detail key aspects of the evidence of the Complainant and her Stepmother, as well as the evidence of the accused and the Mother. Against this backdrop, I explain the accused’s convictions and sentences.

## Facts that were not disputed

20     The Complainant was born on 21 December 2002. Her Father and Mother divorced in March 2004.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) Her Father was vested with her care and control. The Mother was given access.

21     In 2005/2006, the Father married the Stepmother. The Mother married the accused in 2010 and the Complainant’s stepbrother (the “Stepbrother”) was born in 2012.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) The Complainant addressed the accused as “Encik”.

22     The Complainant’s Stepmother was also related to the accused. This was because the Stepmother’s auntie was married to the accused’s uncle.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) The Stepmother therefore knew the accused and his family since young.

### Living arrangements between 2013 & 17 January 2017

23     From 2013 until the Report on 18 January 2017, the Complainant spent half of her mid-year and year-end school holidays with her Father and the other half with the Mother.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) Her general living arrangements on other days are set out below.

#### General arrangements between 2013 & December 2014

24     The Complainant stayed with her paternal grandparents on weekdays from 2013 to 2014, when she was in Primary 5 and 6. On weekends, she would stay with the Mother, Stepbrother, and the accused; or with her Father and Stepmother.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

#### General arrangements from December 2014 to 17 January 2017

25     Sometime in December 2014, the Complainant started staying with the Mother, Stepbrother, and the accused in the Flat on weekdays.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) A domestic helper (the “Helper”) was engaged sometime in December 2015.[^26] The Complainant and the Helper had their own bedrooms, which were next to each other. Her Stepbrother slept in the master bedroom with the Mother and the accused.[^27]

26     On weekends, the Complainant would stay with her Father and Stepmother. She would leave the Flat on Friday evenings and return on Sunday evenings.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) However, there were weekends where she remained in the Flat instead and did not go to stay with her Father and Stepmother.[^29]

27     Before the Complainant started staying with the Mother in the Flat on weekdays, the Stepmother had received a message from the Mother. The Mother had informed the Stepmother that she wanted to “get close” to, and “build a rapport” with, the Complainant. The Stepmother responded that she would have to speak to the Father about the Mother’s message as only he could decide on any change to the Complainant’s living arrangements. The Father was initially reluctant to change the Complainant’s living arrangements, but the Stepmother told him to give the Mother a chance to prove she was a good mother. The Stepmother also asked the Complainant if she wanted to stay with the Mother on weekdays. The Complainant was willing to do so as she wanted to get close to the Mother (who she then shared a “sometimes good, sometimes bad” relationship) and as she wanted to spend the weekends with her Father and Stepmother. The Stepmother thus asked the Complainant to convince her Father to change her living arrangements. The Father relented. The existing court order was thus amended to enable the Complainant to stay with the Mother on weekdays instead.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

### Complainant’s secondary education between 2015 & 2017

28     The Complainant commenced Secondary 1 at the School in January 2015. She started Secondary 3 at the School in January 2017, with the Teacher as her form teacher.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) The Teacher had known the Complainant since she was in Secondary 1. The Teacher described the Complainant as a “very pleasant girl”, who was a “good” and “normal” student with no disciplinary problems.[^32]

### Events between 21 & 30 December 2016

29     The Mother and the accused stayed in a chalet with the Complainant from 21 to 23 December 2016 to celebrate her 14th birthday. The Complainant also followed them to Kuala Lumpur from 25 to 30 December 2016.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

### Complainant left lunchbox at riser duct on 10 January 2017

30     On the morning of 10 January 2017, the Complainant left her lunchbox, containing food the Helper had prepared for her to bring to school, at the riser duct (the “Duct”) outside the Flat.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) She did this because she did not feel like eating the food packed for her that day. I will refer to the Complainant’s act of leaving her lunchbox at the Duct on the morning of 10 January 2017 as the “Lunchbox Incident”. The accused found the lunchbox at the Duct at about 9:00am that same morning. He took a photograph of it at the Duct[^35] and sent the photograph to the Mother over WhatsApp shortly thereafter. The Mother then forwarded this same photograph to the Complainant at about 9:36am that same morning over WhatsApp[^36] and proceeded to question her about the Lunchbox Incident.[^37]

### Complainant’s disclosure to Teacher on 11 January 2017

31     The School had an initiative where form teachers (like the Teacher) would bring a student out from the classroom during the “Character and Citizenship Education” (“CCE”) lesson to have a “chat” with that student about anything the student wished to raise. The Teacher would select her students randomly for such chats. A student would not know beforehand that he/she would be selected.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

32     On 11 January 2017, the Teacher brought the Complainant to the School library for such a chat. The Complainant did not know beforehand that the Teacher would be speaking to her. The Teacher commenced the session by asking the Complainant about her co-curricular activities (“CCA”), her friends, her family tree, and her relationship with her parents. The Complainant told the Teacher that her biological parents had divorced when she was 3 years old and that they had each since remarried. She also told the Teacher about her living arrangements with them and that they quarrelled about her.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

33     When the Teacher probed the Complainant about her relationship with the Mother, the Complainant said it was “not very good” and that they were “not very close”. The Complainant also said that she felt the Mother favoured her Stepbrother. She further said that she felt she was just a helper and not a daughter.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

34     When the Teacher asked the Complainant if she was on talking terms with her stepfather (the accused), the Complainant said she was not. The Teacher followed up and asked her about how the accused treated her. In response, the Complainant said that “something happened to her \[in the\] middle of 2016”.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) The Teacher’s testimony on this aspect is set out below:[^42]

> Q:    And what was this something. Did \[the Complainant\] elaborate?

> A:    Uh, so I ask\[ed\] what happened…in \[the\] middle of 2016. So, **\[the Complainant\] said that…when she was having backache, the \[accused\] volunteered to massage her back for her in her room**. So, I said, “Okay, and then what happened after that?” **\[The Complainant\] said that \[the accused\] slipped his hand under her top and massaged her breast. So…I went on to ask whether did she stop him, so she \[said\] she just kept quiet…the incident only stopped when…\[the Mother\] was at the gate…and wanting to come in but she \[had\] no keys, so the \[accused\] had to open the door for her.**

> Q:    What was **\[the Complainant’s\] demeanour like when she told you about this incident**?

> A:     **\[She\] was a bit hesitant…she was scared, so I asked her… “Why didn’t you report it to your \[Mother\] or the police?” since she was scared. And \[she said\] she didn’t want the relationship with her \[Mother\] to…get worse…if she were to inform her \[Mother\].**

> Q:    And then, what did you say to \[the Complainant\] after that?

> A:    So, I said, “Okay…after that, did you talk to \[the accused\]?” She said that…a few days later \[he\] asked her about her back and wanted to massage…her but she said no.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

35     According to the Teacher, the Complainant was “hesitant” when relaying this incident. The Complainant also did not want to elaborate. The Teacher had to probe her for details. The Teacher also said that the Complainant told her that she was “scared” that the accused would “want to do it again”.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43)

36     The Teacher’s session with the Complainant lasted for about 30 minutes. When it ended, she informed the Complainant that she[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) needed to speak to the Principal of the School (the “Principal”) about her revelation and told her to return to class. The Teacher then went to inform the Principal. The Principal referred the matter to the Counsellor that same day. He also said he would contact the MSF.[^45]

37     The Teacher said she did not ask the Complainant if the incident she relayed was the only one that made her uncomfortable. She explained that she did not probe the Complainant about other incidents as the bell had rung and she had to rush off to see the Principal and attend to her remaining lessons.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46)

### Complainant’s disclosure to Counsellor on 13 January 2017

38     The Counsellor worked only on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays. The Complainant was referred to the Counsellor on 11 January 2017 (a Wednesday, a non-working day for the Counsellor).[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47) On 13 January 2017 (a Friday), the Teacher brought the Complainant to see the Counsellor at the counselling room at about 12:30pm. The Teacher did not enter the room.[^48]

39     The Complainant and the Counsellor had never met each other before 13 January 2017. The Counsellor informed the Complainant at the start of their session that she would keep what the Complainant told her confidential unless doing so would harm the Complainant or others – in which case she would have to refer the matter to “the higher authority”.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

40     As the Counsellor wanted to build some rapport with the Complainant before discussing her revelation to the Teacher, she spoke to the Complainant on a general topic. The Complainant told her that she liked writing and said she would usually pen her thoughts on paper. The Counsellor thus thought it would be good for the Complainant to be given some time to sit down and write “about the case that \[was\] troubling her so much”. She therefore sat the Complainant down at a desk in the counselling room, gave her a pen and a piece of paper, and told her “to take her time to think carefully and write down what was bothering her”. The note that was written by the Complainant (the “Note”) read as follows:[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50)

> There is one thing that has been bothering me a lot lately – my stepfather. He has been my stepfather since I was in secondary school and I have always seen him as the kind, religious man but ever since I stayed at my mom’s house for my secondary life, my view towards him changed. It all started when my mom got too carried \[away\] with her work and my muscles \[were\] killing me. It was night time and my maid and my little brother \[were\] asleep, leaving me alone together with my stepdad. He seem\[ed\] to notice my pain in the backbone and he ask\[ed\] if I wanted a massage. My step-dad and I aren’t close so I didn’t know how to politely reject him so I agreed to his offer. The first massage wasn’t so touchy, he only massage\[d\] my backbone and I thought that he \[had\] no intention to do anything wrong so I agreed to his offer whenever he offer\[ed\] me a massage. But after a few massages, I beg\[a\]n to notice that he beg\[a\]n to be a little more touchy and secretive and I realise\[d\] that he doesn’t massage \[me\] whenever my mom is around. Then there is one night where I agreed to his massage and \[he\] ordered me to sleep. He later ask\[ed\] if it hurts but I didn’t reply him because I was too tired to do so. After \[he asked me this question the third time\], he start\[ed\] to get more touchy. He beg\[a\]n to stroke my legs, my tummy and then he grope\[d\] on my chest. I was shocked and I had no idea what to do but to stay still. He continued to grope me and I heard him pulling his shorts down and a lot of scenarios played in my head \[and\] then the next thing I knew, something hard was rubbing against my pants and it took me a few seconds to realise what it \[was\]. I wanted to cry but held my tears back and prayed to \[G\]od. God did answer\[\] my prayers because my step dad quickly walk\[ed\] away when he heard my mom unlocking the house door. Ever since that day, I tried to avoid him but it is extremely difficult when I am staying under the same roof as \[him\]. I did \[think\] about reporting to the police but there are a few consequences that I will have to face:

>> 1)    Nobody will believe me. I am the mischievous child who loves to create trouble and often telling lies whereas my step dad is very religious.

>> 2)    My mom might break her relationship with me. My mom and me are not close. Instead, we are very far apart from each other and she often thinks that I hate her so if I break the news to her, she would prob\[a\]bly say that I want to break her relationship with my step dad.

>> 3)    My dad can’t control his anger so he would prob\[a\]bly beat my step father up very badly and he might go to jail and I can’t bear that because I love him too much.

> and I decided to make my relationship with my mom become closer and let her grow trust in me before breaking the news to her.

41     After the Complainant finished penning the Note, the Counsellor sought to “clarify a bit” with the Complainant.[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) The Counsellor wrote “Date not known. July?” in the right-hand margin of the Note because the Complainant could not remember the month in 2016 that the accused had touched her and thought that it might have been sometime in July 2016.

42     According to the Counsellor, the Complainant told her about the accused’s massage, that he had “touch\[ed\] her breast”, and that she “felt very uncomfortable”. When the Counsellor asked the Complainant to clarify which side of her breast the accused had touched, the Complainant replied, “right side”. The Counsellor thus wrote “right breast…he slipped his hand into her T-shirt” in the left-hand margin of the Note.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52)

43     When the Counsellor asked the Complainant why she had not revealed the matters in her Note earlier, the Complainant replied that her relationship with the Mother was “not good”/“not close”.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) That said, the Complainant told the Counsellor that she did tell her Stepmother who she was closer to than the Mother. The Complainant informed the Counsellor that her Stepmother told her “to report to the police”. However, the Counsellor said that the Complainant “could not take that”. She also said the Complainant was “quite emotional” during their session.[^54]

44     The Counsellor told the Complainant that she had to refer the matter to the Principal and made a copy of the Note.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)

45     Before their session ended, the Counsellor told the Complainant that she had “to be careful” and asked if she could lock the door of her bedroom. The Complainant responded that she could not. This was because the Mother did not allow her to as the Mother felt that she would not be studying if she did so. The Complainant also told the Counsellor that she felt safe whenever she was with her Stepbrother or the Helper. The Counsellor advised the Complainant to keep close to her Stepbrother and the Helper over that weekend to avoid being alone with the accused. The Complainant said she would do so and went home thereafter.

46     The Counsellor then went to see the Principal. However, the Principal was in a meeting and was not able to meet her. She thus went home, intending to report the matter to him on the following Monday (16 January 2017).[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56)

### Events on 16 January 2017

47     The Principal was not in on the morning of 16 January 2017. The Counsellor only managed to see him with the Note in the late afternoon. After reading the Note, the Principal told the Counsellor that he wanted to see the Complainant. By this time, the Complainant had already gone home. The Counsellor then called the Complainant on her mobile-phone and got her to return to the School. The Counsellor and the Complainant then met the Principal, who informed the Complainant that he would have to inform Child Protection Officers of her revelation. The Counsellor and the Complainant thus remained in the School until about 7:00pm. However, the Principal was not able to get in touch with the Child Protection Officers. As such, he told them to go home and said he would continue to contact the Child Protection Officers the next day (17 January 2017).[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57)

### Events on 17 January 2017

48     As the Principal was still unable to contact the Child Protection Officers on 17 January 2017, “nothing could be done”.[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58)

### Events before lodging of police report on 18 January 2017

49     The Principal managed to call the Child Protection Officers down to the School on the afternoon on 18 January 2017. The Teacher and the Counsellor accompanied the Complainant to see the Child Protection Officers (the “CPOs”) when they arrived. The CPOs, who had been given the Note, “tried to…put \[the Complainant\] at ease…and told her to tell the truth, to tell what’s correct, and if there’s any mistake, she can correct herself”. After speaking to the Complainant, the CPOs said they had to bring the Complainant to the police station. The Teacher accompanied the Complainant to the NPC.

### Police report lodged on 18 January 2017

50     The Report was lodged at about 3:41pm. The information reflected in the Report was typed down by the “counter officer” who attended to the Complainant at the NPC.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) IO Isak, the “duty officer” on that day, received the Report later that same day. After reviewing the Report, he spoke to a CPO (who had accompanied the Complainant) and then to the Complainant. He then recorded a statement from the Complainant that same day, following which he called the Mother and the accused down for their statements to be recorded.[^60]

### Living arrangements after 18 January 2017

51     After the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017, the police told the Complainant’s Father and Stepmother that she would have to stay with them. The Complainant did not return to the Flat thereafter. In any event, the Mother, the accused, and the Stepbrother moved out of the Flat in February 2017.[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61)

## CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

52     Key aspects of the Complainant’s testimony are set out in this section. The Stepmother’s initial testimony in July 2019 is also set out.

### Complainant’s testimony

53     The Complainant testified about the Bedroom Incident, the Master Bedroom Incident, and the Sofa Incident (collectively, the “Three Incidents”). She also described her relationship with the Mother and the accused, as well as the “few” massages the accused had performed on her before the Bedroom Incident.

#### December 2014 move into Flat to work on relationship with Mother

54     The Complainant said the Mother had asked her to move into the Flat a few days after her Primary School Leaving Examinations in 2014 ended. She told the Mother, who she was “not close” to, that she wanted to think about this. However, the Mother kept asking her to live with her. The Mother also kept telling her that she wanted to “make \[their\] relationship closer” and that she would spend more time with her. The Complainant eventually started staying in the Flat on weekdays from December 2014 as she “also want\[ed\] to make \[their\] relationship closer” and believed that the Mother would spend more time with her.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62)

55     When asked to describe her relationship with the Mother before she started staying in the Flat on weekdays from December 2014, the Complainant said that “\[i\]t wasn’t really good”. She said they “rarely communicate\[d\] and…it wasn’t like a normal mother and daughter relationship”. According to the Complainant, they were “like stranger\[s\] but \[they were\] related”. However, she said that although they did not talk, she felt they still had that “small connection”. As such, when the Mother “asked \[her\] to live with her, \[she\] felt pity because \[she felt that the Mother\] really want\[ed\] to make \[their\] relationship closer.”[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

#### Relationship with Mother & accused did not improve

56     However, the Complainant’s relationship with the Mother did not improve after she started staying with her on weekdays from December 2014. She described their relationship from December 2014 until the time the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017 as “not close”. According to the Complainant, most of their conversations (which happened only “sometimes”) revolved around her studies and school. She said she feared the Mother because she “was a very fierce mum ever since \[she\] was born and…would sometimes…scold\[\] \[her\] over small things”. She also said the Mother’s scoldings made her feel she was “not allowed to say things that \[she\] want\[ed\] to say to \[the Mother\] or else \[the Mother would\] get mad”. She further said that the Mother would “sometimes…use her hands to beat \[her\]” – and this made her “feel more scared of \[the Mother\]”.[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64)

57     As for her relationship with the accused, the Complainant said they “weren’t close” (or were “not really close”). She said they did not talk often – and even when they did, it was only on whether she had eaten and the time she would finish school the next day. The Complainant said she felt “a bit uncomfortable around \[the accused\] because \[she\] wasn’t close with \[the Mother\]”.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65)

#### Accused’s “few” massages in living room before Bedroom Incident

58     According to the Complainant, the accused had massaged her a “few times” _before_ the Bedroom Incident (the first of the Three Incidents). She said he had offered to massage her back as she had been complaining about backaches. He told her he had been to “a few massages outside \[which\] taught him how to massage” and he could therefore “help \[her\] to reduce the pain”.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66) In examination-in-chief, she described these initial few massages on the “couch” in the living room of the Flat; when and how the accused massaged her; the duration of these massages; and who else was present when the accused was massaging her:[^67]

> A:    He would tell me to lie on the couch \[in the living room of the Flat\], face down, and then he would…slide his hand under my…chest area and…he would use his left hand to place it under my left breast and use \[his\] right hand to push it from \[my\] shoulder blade area and then he would use his right hand to put under my left breast and then \[he would\] use his left hand to push…my right shoulder blade.

> Q:    Was this over or under your clothes?

> A:    Over.

> Q:    And how long would each massage last?

> A:    For a few minutes.

> Q:    And around what time would these massages take place?

> A:    Um, at night. Mostly at night.

> …

> Q:    And would anyone see you being massaged?

> A:    No.

> Q:    Why not?

> A:    Because it…always happened when my mum \[was\] at work and when…my maid is already in her room and my little brother is sleeping.

59     In cross-examination, the Complainant was asked about the number of occasions the accused had massaged her _before_ the Bedroom Incident (the first of the Three Incidents). She estimated that the accused had massaged her “around 5” times _before_ the Bedroom Incident. As with her examination-in-chief, she went on to describe how the accused massaged her in the living room of the Flat; and who else was present when the accused was massaging her:[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68)

> Q:    \[The Bedroom Incident, the first of the Three Incidents\] was not the first time the accused has massaged you.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    He has massaged you more than once.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    How many occasions?

> A:    Maybe around 5. Around 5.

> Q:    How often \[did these\] massage session\[s\] take place?

> A:    It depends. Sometimes it will be like \[every\] few days…or maybe \[every\] few weeks.

> Q:    And how does he massage you on \[these\] other occasions?

> A:    \[T\]he first few occasions, he would firstly massage my back using his thumb, he will massage around my…spine area and then he will go upwards towards the shoulder area and then he will tell me to lie down…on the couch, face flat and then he will slide his…hands under my chest and then he will…use his available hand to push it from my shoulder blade.

> Q:    Like putting pressure.

> A:    Yah.

> Q:    And does this massage helps you on your back pain?

> A:    Not really.

> Q:    So if it doesn’t help you, why didn’t you ask him to stop?

> A:    \[B\]efore the \[Bedroom Incident, the first of the Three Incidents\], I didn’t decline his offer because I thought that he was just trying to do it out of his goodwill and then like after the \[Bedroom Incident\], I would…often tell him that I…don’t want a massage.

> Q:    Yah. There are \[a\] couple of things, let me clarify, huh. You earlier used the word couch.

> A:    Hmm.

> Q:    Okay. So, it’s not the bed.

> A:    No.

> Q:    Where did \[these\] other massage\[s\] \[before the Bedroom Incident take\] place?

> A:    Living room.

> Q:    And who will be around? ...Would there be \[anybody\] else?

> A:    No. I mean, there is but they are sleeping…My maid and my little brother but my mum is out for work.

60     The Complainant confirmed she “agree\[d\] to allow \[the accused\] to do these massages on \[her\]”. She said she had agreed “at first” to these prior massages as she “thought… \[the accused\] was…just trying to help \[her\] make \[her\] body don’t feel as painful as before”. She said she had then “force\[d\] herself to agree” “after a few massages” because she was **“****scared****”** that the accused “might scold \[her\]”. In this regard, she explained that she was **scared** of the accused because she was “**scared**” of the Mother “to the point where \[she\] would feel very intimidated by a lot of things” – and this was “the reason why \[she\] felt **scared** towards \[the accused\]”. She said she did not think that the Mother was aware that the accused was massaging her. She also said that the Mother had never asked her about the accused’s massages.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69)

#### Three incidents of “molest” in 2016

61     The Complainant said she made the Report “because \[she\] was molested by \[her\] stepfather”. When asked about the number of times the accused had “molested” her, she said “3”.[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70) Her testimony on these Three Incidents is set out in the paragraphs that follow.

##### (1)   Bedroom Incident

62     The Complainant was asked about the circumstances surrounding “the first time \[the accused\] molested her”. She was not able to remember the date but recalled that this happened before her 14th birthday (_viz_, before 21 December 2016) when the Mother was not in the Flat.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) She said the Helper and her Stepbrother were in the Flat at the material time. However, her Stepbrother was asleep while the Helper was “in her \[own\] room with her door locked”. The Complainant said she knew that the Helper “was in her room with the door locked” as the Helper would “always lock herself in \[her\] room after 9 plus \[at night\] and “wouldn’t \[come\] out until the next morning”. The Complainant said this happened “every night” – after the Helper was “done with her work…she would…go inside her room and do her own business with the door closed”.[^72]

63     The Complainant said she was in her bedroom “preparing to sleep” when the accused entered at about “9 plus”[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) and asked her if she wanted a massage.[^74] She “wanted to say no because \[she\] was already uncomfortable with him”, but she “was **afraid** to say no”. As such, she “forced \[herself\] to agree to his offer \[of a massage\]”. She said he “told \[her\] to lie on \[her\] bed…facing the wall on \[her\] left side” (such that her back was facing him and the door to the bedroom). He then began to massage her back, using his thumbs to massage her “spine area” and his other hand to “apply pressure” on her back. While massaging her back, he asked her “if it hurts or not”. She “didn’t reply him because \[she\] was tired”. She explained that she had had a “a tiring day at school” and doing her homework had been “quite tiring” as well. By the time she finished her homework, it was past her usual bedtime of “8 plus” to “around 9 plus”.[^75]

64     The Complainant said that the accused asked her, again, “if it hurts or not but, again, \[she\] didn’t reply him”.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) She said the accused had been massaging her for about 5 minutes[^77] when the following happened:[^78]

> And then slowly, he start to lie behind me \[on my bed\][^79] and then…he used his \[right\] leg to caress \[my calves on both of my legs\]. Then, …after that he slide his \[right\] hand into my shirt, stroke my tummy and then he went up to my chest area. And then…I heard the sound of his pants like…he was…unbuckling his pants and then after that I felt like something hard poking against my butt. It happened for a few minutes until the doorbell rings. Then, he left my \[bedroom\] and opened the \[main\] door \[to the Flat\] for my \[Mother\].

65     The Complainant was asked to elaborate on what happened when the accused “went up to \[her\] chest area”.[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80) She did so as in the following terms:[^81]

> Q:    And when you said that he went up to your chest area, could you elaborate on that please?

> A:    He grabbed on my breast.

> Q:    Which breast are you referring to?

> A:    Um, the right one but I can’t recall if he did the same for the left.

> Q:    And how long did he grab \[on\] your breast for?

> A:    For a few minutes.

> Q:    And how much force did he use when he grabbed your breast?

> A:    Not much force.

> Q:    And how did you feel at this point in time when he was grabbing your breast?

> **A:**      **I was feeling** **scared** **and extremely uncomfortable**.[^82]

> Q:    When you said that…he grabbed your breast, did he ma\[k\]e skin to skin contact with your breast?

> A:    No.

> Q:    Can you elaborate?

> A:    He grabbed my breast but it was outside my bra but inside my shirt.

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

66     The Complainant was also asked if she saw what the accused was doing after she heard him unbuckling his pants.[\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83) She said as follows:[^84]

> Q:    You…also mentioned that you heard something like him pulling down---unbuckling his pants. Did you see what he was doing?

> A:    No.

> Q:    Why not?

> **A:**      **Because I was** **scared** **to look back.**

> Q:    And in your mind, what do you think he was doing?

> A:    Um, I think that, um, he was stroking, um, his private part against my butt.

> Q:    And how do you come to this conclusion?

> A:    Because it was hard and I don’t think that it’s his fingers because he---um, it’s quite big.

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

67     The Complainant was further asked how she knew that it was the Mother at the main door.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85) She explained as follows:[^86]

> Q:    You mentioned that this happened for a few minutes, this whole incident, until the doorbell rang. And he left your room and opened the door for your mother. How do you know that it was your mother at the door?

> A:    Because…on that night she was supposed to come back from her shift at work. And I know that…it was her. I know that the doorbell rings because it rings. And the…\[latch\] of the door was closed.

> Q:    \[W\]hat do you mean by the “\[latch\] of the door was closed”?

> A:    Because I heard…before this incident happened, I heard \[the accused\] closing the door because, like when the \[latch\] hits the door…it will make a very loud sound.

> Q:    \[W\]hen you say “Closing the door”, which door are you referring to?

> A:    The main door.

68     She denied that the Mother entered her bedroom after returning to the Flat (whether to check on her back pain or to ask how she was feeling).[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87)

69     When asked if she had “attempt\[ed\] to run out of \[her bedroom\] or shout for help” while the accused “was doing all of those actions” on her, the Complainant replied that she did not “but…thought of doing it”. She explained she was “**scared**” that the accused would “do something more worse” to her if she made a noise or if she tried to run away.[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88) She elaborated in cross-examination in the following terms:[^89]

> Q:    When the incident happened \[in your bedroom\], you didn’t also scream shout for help.

> A:    No.

> Q:    And it’s your evidence that your mother returned shortly.

> A:    Yah.

> Q:    You didn’t go to her.

> A:    No.

> Q:    \[S\]houldn’t you be feeling angry, agitated?

> **A:**      **I was feeling** **most scared** **than angry.**

> Q:    Scared of who, what, why?

> **A:**      **Scared** **of my mum**, **scared** **of my stepfather because I was grown to be** **scared** **of them, so it’s just takes to me---to be** **scared** **of them.**

> Q:    They will hurt you? They will beat you?

> A:    Not my stepfather.

> Q:    Your stepfather has not beaten you at all.

> A:    No.

> Q:    Not scolded you at all also.

> A:    No.

> …

> Q:    So why must you be scared of your stepfather?

> **A:**      **Because…I have seen him losing his temper\[\] \[with\] my little brother so I’m** **afraid** **he might do the same to me if I don’t…listen to him.**

> …

> Q:    So he’s a nice person in a sense. Doesn’t beat you, doesn’t scold you, doesn’t raised his hands towards you.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So what makes you think he might do something to you and be afraid of him?

> …

> **A:**      **Because he already did something to me.**

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

70     According to the Complainant, she did not inform anyone about the Bedroom Incident because she was “**scared**” she would be asked to go to the police station. She said she was “a very timid and intimidated girl” and she was “**scared** of going to the police station.[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90)

##### (2)   Master Bedroom Incident

71     The Complainant was asked about the circumstances surrounding the “2nd time \[the accused\] molested \[her\]”. She said this happened before her 14th birthday (_viz_, before 21 December 2016), after the Bedroom Incident. She was unable to remember the time it happened but estimated that it was sometime in the afternoon – “\[m\]aybe around 4 plus”. This was because her Stepbrother was not yet asleep, and she recalled it was “quite bright outside”. I set out her evidence-in-chief on this second incident, which she said happened in the master bedroom of the Flat:[\[note: 91\]](#Ftn_91)

> Q:    \[W\]e’re moving on to the 2nd incident are you able to recall when was the 2nd time your stepfather molested you?

> A:     **It was in 2016…again my \[Mother\] wasn’t at home** but my \[Stepbrother\] was in the…living room playing with his toys and **my stepfather was in his room \[****_viz_****., the master bedroom of the Flat\]. And when I was about to go in my \[bed\]room, he called me…and I was standing in front \[of\] his room door. And he asked me for a massage again, I said no but he just…grab my arm and pull me inside his room and he told me to lay on \[the\] bed…face down with my legs still on the floor. And he told me to spread my legs…spread my hands up. And then…he begin to…massage my \[spine**\]**…in circles then after that he…put his hands under…my chest and …with one hand under my chest he used his other hand to push it from the back. And…after that I heard, like his…belt unbuckled and the sound of his pants, as if it was…pulling down. And then again, I felt something hard against my butt. And at that point of time I felt very uncomfortable.** And---and um, yah.

> Q:    Is there anything else…you want to say in relation to this?

> A:    …I told him that I’m feeling better…and…then he told me to wait for a few minutes and while waiting I heard the sound of his pants going back up…And then he say that I’m free to go so I immediately went out from the room without looking back.

> …

> Q:    \[Y\[ou mentioned that he put his hands under your chest and with one hand under your chest, he will use his other hand to push it from the back, can you explain what you mean by that?

> A:    Um, he would slide---**he will put his hand under my breast area with one hand. And then another hand he’ll start to put force from the back**.

> Q:    When you say the “back” \[,\] you mean your back?

> A:    Yah.

> Q:    And which part of back are you referring to?

> A:    The shoulder blade area.

> Q:    You mentioned that he would put one hand under your breast area and the other hand on your back \[,\] which hand did he put under your breast area?

> A:    Both hands but for different sides.

> Q:    Can you explain the sequence?

> A:    Like, h**e would use his left hand to put under left breast area and used the right hand to push from the shoulder blade area. Then he would use his right…hand to put under my right…breast area and use his left hand to push from the shoulder**.

> Q:    …You mentioned that you heard his belt unbuckle and the sound of his pants as if…he was pulling down…did you see what he was doing?

> **A:**      **No, I was** **scared** **to look.**

> Q:    So, how did you come to the conclusion that he was pulling down his pants?

> A:    Because…I got used a belt before and I know the sound of the belt when you want to unbuckle the belt. And…I also got use pants before. So, I know how the sound of the pants would sound like when you pull it down.

> Q:    And you mentioned that you felt very uncomfortable, can you elaborate what do you mean by that?

> **A:**      **I felt very uncomfortable and I felt** **scared** **. And I felt like I didn’t want to be there and I want to be away from him.**

> **Q:**      **And did you call out for help at that point in time?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **Why not?**

> **A:**      **Because I was** **scared** **.**

> Q:    And what were you scared of?

> **A:**      **I was** **scare\[d\]** **that if I call out for help, he might do something worse.**

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

72     The Complainant said the Helper had been in the kitchen before this incident (and explained that she knew this because she had just left the kitchen and was walking to her bedroom when the accused pulled her into the master bedroom). However, the Complainant was unsure if the Helper had walked past the master bedroom during the incident.[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92)

73     In cross-examination, the Complainant testified that the accused (who was wearing a T-shirt and “long pants”) had called out her name as she was walking to her bedroom. He asked her if she wanted a massage and she said “no”. He then dragged her by her forearm with his left hand and dragged/pulled her from the entrance of the master bedroom into the master bedroom. She said she did not shout when the accused did this because she was **scared**. However, she said she tried to resist when he was dragging/pulling her by trying to push herself away from the accused (but to no avail). According to the Complainant, the accused had grabbed and pulled her over the course of “a few seconds”. She testified that the door to the master bedroom was “slightly opened” (and not shut or latched) when she was inside the room.[\[note: 93\]](#Ftn_93) She also testified on what then happened when she was inside the master bedroom:[^94]

> Q:    Okay. Okay. Now, you’re in the \[master bedroom\], what happened?

> A:    He told me to lay down face flat while I was still standing.

> Q:    Did you say, “No, I’m not going to lie down”?

> A:    No.

> Q:    Did you shout, “I’m not going to lie down”?

> A:    No.

> **Q:**      **Did you resist from lying down?**

> **A:**      **I hesitate.**

> …

> Q:    And then you went and lie down on the bed?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Where was your face…facing?

> A:    The bed.

> Q:    And where was the accused?

> A:    \[B\]ehind me.

> Q:    And tell us what happened?

> A:    Um, then **he told me to spread my arms open, and then he starts to massage my back again. And after that** he slide, again, **he slide his hands under my**, um, **chest, and then he used his another hand to push it from the back again. And then after that**, um, **I can hear like the sound of his buckle, unbuckled and then like the sound \[of\] his pants as \[if it\] was**, um, **going down, and then I felt like something hard poking against my butt**.

> Q:    Okay, wait. What was the accused wearing?

> A:    \[L\]ong pants.

> …

> Q:    Okay. What were you wearing?

> A:    I was wearing a t-shirt and a long pants.

> **Q:**      **So when this thing happening…how do you feel?**

> **A:**      **Scared** **.**

> **Q:**      **Scared of?**

> **A:**      **Scared** **that something bad might happened.**

> **Q:**      **Like?**

> **A:**      **Like…rape.**

> Q:    So…this thought of you being raped in your own flat came to your mind at that moment?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    What did you do?

> A:    Nothing.

> Q:    Your maid is at home, you know.

> A:    Yah.

> **Q:**      **Could you not have shout\[ed\]?**

> **A:**      **I was** **scared** **.**

> Q:    \[A\]ccording to your evidence, there’s a possibility you might be raped?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And you never even shout, raise your voice, push him away?

> A:    No.

> …

> Q:    How long…this incident of this massage and your alleged molest occurred?

> …

> A:    Duration?...Like around 10---5, 10 minutes to 15 minutes.

> Q:    So even when you felt something hard poking behind your back, you didn’t call for \[the Helper\]?

> A:    Yes.

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

##### (3)   Sofa Incident

74     I set out key aspects of the Complainant’s testimony on the Sofa Incident in this section.

(A)   Examination-in-chief

75     The Complainant testified that the “3rd incident” of “molest” took place in 2016, after the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident. She said this had happened sometime between 7:00pm and 8:00pm, when she and the accused were seated on the sofa in the living room. She described what happened:[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95)

> **Q:**      **And what happened during this incident?**

> **A:**      **\[The accused\] called me out and said that he wants to talk to me about something and while talking, he suddenly…pulled the…collar of my t-shirt. And then he looked inside.** And then…after that, he sat beside me and put his arm around my shoulder and…hover his hand around my breast.

> Q:    You mentioned…that he called you up and said that he wanted to talk to you about something. What is this “something” that he talked to you about?

> A:    I don’t remember.

> …

> **Q:**      **You mentioned that he pulled the collar of your t-shirt and then looked inside. What do you mean by “He looked inside”?**

> **A:**      **\[W\]hen he pulled my collar, he would tilt his head and his eyes were looking inside my t-shirt.**

> **Q:**      **And what was your reaction when he did that?**

> **A:**      **I was** **shocked** **.**

> **Q:**      **Did you do anything? Did you react physically?**

> **A:**      **Physically, no.**

> **Q:**      **Why not?**

> **A:**      **Because I was** **scared** **.**

> **Q:**      **And what were you scared of?**

> **A:**      **Scared** **of him.**

> …

> **Q:**      **And in relation to the 3rd incident when you mentioned that he pulled down the collar of your T-shirt, do you know what he was looking at?**

> **A:**      **Um, I think he was looking at my breast.**

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

(B)   Cross-examination

76     The Complainant elaborated on this incident in cross-examination. She said she was in her bedroom when the accused called out her name and gestured to her to come out into the living room. The Mother was then not in the Flat. Her Stepbrother was sleeping while the Helper was in her own bedroom.[\[note: 96\]](#Ftn_96)

77     The Complainant said that the accused spoke to her while they were seated on the sofa. This happened at around 8:00pm or 9:00pm. The entire “conversation” was “quite long, more than 10 minutes”. She was not sure how it had started. However, she could recall he was talking to her “about some things” (the details of which she said she could not recall as he “didn’t really do anything” to her while talking about these things) when he “suddenly talked about \[her\] wearing a necklace” and how she “shouldn’t…show off too much”.[\[note: 97\]](#Ftn_97) She said that her Father and Stepmother had given her this necklace, but she could not remember when they had done so.[^98] She said she did not wear this necklace to school. She also said that she could not remember if she was wearing this necklace (which reached just below her collarbone) when the accused was talking to her.[^99] I set out her testimony on what happened after he “suddenly” brought up her necklace:[^100]

> Q:    …And the accused was asking you why you’re wearing a gold chain when previously he told you not to wear it. Do you recall that?

> A:    No.

> Q:    And the accused \[had\] told you that it’s expensive, you shouldn’t be wearing this gold chain to go out. Do you recall him telling you this?

> A:    No.

> Q:    And…at this moment, he checked by touching \[your\] T-shirt and not pulling the collar towards him.

> **A:**      **I vividly remember that he pulled the collar of my T-shirt.**

> Q:    He just brought it down to observe.

> **A:**      **But he pulled it up.**

> Q:    …Okay, you said that \[he\] hold his hand and hover the hand over the breast.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    See my instruction is he…just brought it down to check on the…white-gold necklace.

> **A:**      **He did but after he pulled down, he pull up my T-shirt, he sat beside me and then, he slipped his hand over my shoulder, and then he hover his left hand over my left breast.**

> **Q:**      **I’m instructed that he…did not see inside the T-shirt.**

> **A:**      **But---**

> Q:    That’s what he claimed.

> **A:**      **he looked in.**

> Q:    He was looking at the white-gold necklace.

> A:    Okay.

> Q:    You agree?

> A:    I don’t remember if I was wearing a necklace.

> …

> **Q:**      **Put it to you that he just pulled down \[your collar a\] little bit to see \[your necklace\], and advise you not to wear it.**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **He did not hover \[his hand\] over your breast\[.\]. He did not pull \[your\] t-shirt to see inside of your t-shirt.**

> **A:**      **He did.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

78     The Complainant said she considered that the accused was disciplining her when he was talking to her. She said she had been “reflecting on” herself when he was disciplining her, until he held the neckline of her T-shirt. She also said she went into to her bedroom to sleep after he was “done talking” to her.[\[note: 101\]](#Ftn_101)

79     The Complainant said the Mother had returned to the Flat, after jogging, “halfway” during the accused’s talk with her and while he was talking to her about the necklace. Without acknowledging her presence, the Mother had then gone into the kitchen to eat. She said she was not sure if the Mother saw what the accused had done as she had not looked at the Mother at this time.[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102)

(C)   Re-examination

80     In cross-examination, the Complainant said that the accused had never disciplined her until the day of the Sofa Incident. She said it had “always been \[her\] mum” disciplining her before the Sofa Incident. Should there be “any issue”, it would also be the Mother, and not the accused, who would speak to her about the issue. She said that the day of the Sofa Incident was the first, and only, time the accused had ever spoken to her “in terms of disciplining” her. She also said that it was the first time they had sat like that on the sofa to talk.[\[note: 103\]](#Ftn_103) In re-examination, she reiterated that the Sofa Incident happened in 2016:

> Q:    If you could refer to \[Exhibit D2, the WhatsApp correspondence with your Mother on 10 January 2017,\] you were asked during Cross-Examination that after these messages were exchanged between you and your \[Mother\], \[the accused\] spoke to you about leaving the food packet in the…electrical riser \[_viz_, the Lunchbox Incident, and your answer was that you do not remember him speaking to you about the \[Lunchbox Incident\]. Do you recall your answer?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    I would like to clarify that answer. Do you mean that he could have spoken to you about it but you don’t remember or he did not speak to you about it at all?

> A:    I don’t remember…if he have \[even\] speak to me about it before.[^104]

> Q:    And who do you remember speaking to you about this \[Lunchbox Incident\]?

> A:    My mum.

> **Q:**      **And you mentioned that \[the accused\] has only had 1 conversation with you where he had disciplined you?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And…your evidence was that this is in relation to the necklace \[that he raised during the Sofa Incident\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **Can you confirm one more time which year this conversation took place?**

> **A:**      **2016.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

#### Disclosure to Stepmother in 2016 after Sofa Incident

81     According to the Complainant, her Stepmother was the _first_ person she informed about the accused’s conduct. She said she told her Stepmother that the accused had “molested” her. She also said she did not tell her Stepmother anything else, such as the number of occasions the accused had molested her or how he had molested her. She recalled informing her Stepmother sometime “towards the end” of 2016, after the Sofa Incident. However, she could not remember when in 2016 she had done so or how she had informed her Stepmother.[\[note: 105\]](#Ftn_105) She explained why she eventually decided to inform her Stepmother:[^106]

> A:    Because…I felt very uncomfortable without telling anyone and I know---I feel like I must tell someone but …I \[did\] not know who to tell. So, I…told my \[Stepmother\] because we…are quite close.

82     The Complainant said that her Stepmother did not believe her at first. She could not recall what her Stepmother had said to her (after she told her that the accused had molested her). She also could not remember what she told her Stepmother when her Stepmother did not initially believe her. She remembered trying to persuade her Stepmother to believe her.[\[note: 107\]](#Ftn_107) According to the Complainant, her Stepmother did not ask her for details as to how she was molested. However, she said that her Stepmother did tell her to “file a report”. She explained why she did not “file a report” although her Stepmother advised her to do so:[^108]

> **Q:**      **So, I…take it that you did not file a report?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **Why?**

> **A:**      **Because I told \[my Stepmother\] that I want to tell…this to my \[Mother\] personally first, but before that, I want to make sure that \[my Mother\] has gained trust in me.**

> Q:    But when your \[Stepmother\] tells you, you have to file a report, did it give you \[the\] impression that it’s something serious?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And you need to take the next step?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    By informing your \[Mother\]?

> **A:**      **\[My Stepmother\] told me to file a report, but I was the one who want to tell to my \[Mother\] first.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

#### Disclosure to Teacher on 11 January 2017

83     The Teacher was the _second_ person the Complainant said she alerted. She recalled doing this in “early 2017”, a “few days before” the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017.[\[note: 109\]](#Ftn_109) She said she told her Teacher she was “molested” by the accused. She explained why she did so:[^110]

> A:    Because at that time…it was during \[CCE\] period and…I have been really bothered about…my stepfather and…my seniors who were once…taught \[by my Teacher\], they told me that she is a very good teacher who gives really good advice, so I thought that by telling her about what happened, she can help me…to ease my um, like to not make me…as uncomfortable as before.

84     The Complainant said she did not remember if she had elaborated on how the accused had molested her. She said her Teacher was shocked and told her she would send her to the Counsellor.[\[note: 111\]](#Ftn_111)

#### Disclosure to Counsellor on 13 January 2017

85     The Complainant said she was sent to the Counsellor a few days after she spoke to her Teacher. She said the Counsellor told her to write about what had happened on a piece of paper. This led to the Note, which she took about 10 to 15 minutes to write. Apart from writing the Note, she said she told the Counsellor that she did not have a good relationship with the Mother. But she could not remember if she told the Counsellor anything else. She said the Counsellor read the Note and then asked her a few questions about “the date and time that the event happened”. The Counsellor then informed her that she would talk to the Principal and that they would “call in the child protection team”.[\[note: 112\]](#Ftn_112)

#### Brought to NPC on 18 January 2017 to lodge police report

86     The Complainant said she met the Counsellor a few times after 13 January 2017. The Counsellor “talked to \[her\] about controlling \[her\] emotions and all sort of things” during these subsequent sessions. The Counsellor also brought her to the “child protection team”, which brought her to the NPC to lodge the Report. She said that the Teacher also accompanied her to the NPC. When asked whether she did “the police report by herself” or if she was “asked to make” it, she said that the “child protection officer” had asked her to make it. According to the Complainant, her Father, Stepmother, Mother, and the accused arrived later at the NPC. She said she did not speak to the Mother at the NPC.[\[note: 113\]](#Ftn_113)

### Stepmother’s initial testimony

87     The Stepmother’s initial testimony in July 2019 (“2019 testimony”) is set out in this section. Her later testimony on 19 February 2021[\[note: 114\]](#Ftn_114) (“2021 testimony”) is detailed below[^115], where I also consider whether her 2019 testimony should be preferred over her previous statements.

#### Complainant’s query about meaning of “molest” in 2016

88     According to the Stepmother, she and the Complainant were watching movies sometime at the end of 2016 when the Complainant “randomly” asked her about the meaning of “molest”. In response, she explained that “molest” “in general term\[s\] \[was when\] someone touches your private part or whatever without your consent”. When she asked the Complainant why she asked this question, the Complainant replied that it was “nothing” and said she was “just randomly asking”. The Stepmother said she did not think much about the Complainant’s question as the Complainant had denied that anything was wrong. As such, the Stepmother said the issue “just disappear\[ed\] from \[her\] mind”.[\[note: 116\]](#Ftn_116)

#### Complainant’s disclosure in first week of January 2017

89     The Stepmother said she only knew that the Complainant had lodged the Report when the Principal called the Father on 18 January 2017. However, she said that she had already known, before the Report was lodged, of the Complainant’s allegation that the accused had molested her a few months before.[\[note: 117\]](#Ftn_117)

90     According to the Stepmother, the Complainant had texted her early in the morning (between 5:45am and 6:45am) sometime in the first week of January 2017 when she had just started Secondary 3.[\[note: 118\]](#Ftn_118) She recalled she had been praying that morning when the Complainant repeatedly texted her “Mama, mama, mama, mama”. The Complainant also stated that it was “urgent”. On seeing “so many” texts from the Complainant, the Stepmother said she texted “What’s up?” in reply. The Complainant then texted “I’m being molested” (or “I was being molested”) in response. The Stepmother said she replied by texting “By who?”. The Complainant took “a long while to reply” but did so eventually with the response “ENCIK” (_viz_, the accused). The Stepmother said she responded with “Huh” and many exclamation marks when she saw the Complainant’s reply.[^119]

91     The Stepmother said she was “shocked” by the Complainant’s revelation and could not believe it at first. This was because she knew the accused’s background, had known his family since young, and knew him to be a “very nice guy” who was “more religious” than her. She thus texted the Complainant, “Are you sure it’s ENCIK?” In response, the Complainant texted “Yes, ENCIK”. She then texted the Complainant, “What did he do?”. However, the Complainant simply texted “Ma, I got to go” in reply.[\[note: 120\]](#Ftn_120)

92     According to the Stepmother, she was wondering at the “back of \[her\] mind” if the Complainant’s revelation was “real or not”. She therefore “put it aside for a while” as she needed to speak to the Complainant personally to know what she meant. She told the Complainant she would see her over the weekend (when the Complainant was supposed to come over to stay).[\[note: 121\]](#Ftn_121)

#### Meeting Complainant over first weekend of January 2017

93     The Stepmother said she asked the Complainant to tell her about what happened when they met each other that weekend.[\[note: 122\]](#Ftn_122) She said the Complainant’s emotional state was “not strong” when they met. However, the Complainant told her that “she \[had\] been molested by Encik”. According to the Stepmother, she responded by asking the Complainant, “Are you sure it’s Encik \[or\] are you trying…to tell me something that is not happening?” The Complainant then replied, “I swear in the name of Allah that it’s Encik who molest\[ed\] me”. The Complainant also said that she was “willing for \[her[^123]\] to bring the Quran and \[to\] tell \[her[^124] that it was\] Encik who \[had\] molest\[ed\] \[her\]”.[^125]

94     According to the Stepmother, she then asked the Complainant to tell her what happened. However, the Complainant started crying and replied, “No, but you…trust me…You must trust me, Mama”. The Stepmother said she then told the Complainant that she trusted her. The Complainant and her then both cried.[\[note: 126\]](#Ftn_126)

95     The Stepmother said she told the Complainant that she[\[note: 127\]](#Ftn_127) needed to tell her Father. However, the Complainant said, “You promised me that you \[are\] not going to tell anybody. I trusted you that’s why I \[told\] you.” The Stepmother said she did not tell the Father about the Complainant’s disclosure because the Complainant “trusted \[her\] to not to tell anybody”.[^128]

96     When it was time for the Complainant to return to the Flat that Sunday[\[note: 129\]](#Ftn_129), the Stepmother said she told the Complainant to be careful and to take care of herself. She also told her to avoid being alone and to be around the Helper if possible. They hugged and cried before the Complainant returned to the Flat.[^130]

#### Communication with Complainant before 18 January 2017

97     According to the Stepmother, she told the Complainant, when the Complainant got “to message” her, that she (the Stepmother) needed to tell the Father and could not “keep quiet about this” (or “carry this anymore”). She said she also told the Complainant that the Complainant “need\[ed\] to make a decision” and that “\[i\]f this really happened, \[the Complainant\] should not keep quiet”. However, the Complainant wanted to first tell the Mother personally about what had happened and asked to be given some time to first get close to the Mother and to build the trust between them. According to the Stepmother, the Complainant was afraid that the Mother would not trust her otherwise. The Stepmother therefore agreed to give the Complainant some time (“about a week or so”) but she told the Complainant that if she did not tell the Mother “by another week” or came back “another weekend…without anything to say that this \[was\] going to be reported”, she (the Stepmother) would tell the Father and they would go to the police and make a report. Before they could make such a report, however, the Stepmother said that the police called her and the Father down to the NPC on 18 January 2017.[\[note: 131\]](#Ftn_131)

#### Complainant did not elaborate on what accused did to her

98     The Stepmother said the Complainant never gave her details on what the accused did. She said she tried to ask the Complainant for details, but the Complainant would cry every time she (the Stepmother) brought up the molest. She thus stopped doing so as the Complainant’s emotional state was “not stable”.[\[note: 132\]](#Ftn_132)

## CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

99     The accused’s position varied in relation to each charge:[\[note: 133\]](#Ftn_133)

> (a)     In relation to the Bedroom Incident, he admitted that he had massaged the Complainant in her bedroom. He also tendered photographs which he claimed showed how he had done so.[\[note: 134\]](#Ftn_134) But, he _denied_ lying down behind the Complainant on her bed and then:

>> (i)       using his leg to caress the calves of both of her legs; and

>> (ii)       sliding his hand under her T-shirt to stroke her tummy and then using that hand to grope her right breast from outside her bra.

> (b)     He _denied_ that the Master Bedroom Incident happened.[\[note: 135\]](#Ftn_135)

> (c)     In relation to the Sofa Incident, he admitted that he had pulled the neckline of the Complainant’s T-shirt down (albeit only slightly). But, he said he had done this only to see/expose the necklace the Complainant was then wearing and not with any intention to intrude into her privacy. He also _denied_ then pulling her neckline up and tilting his head to look inside her T-shirt. He further _denied_ putting his arm around her shoulder and “hovering” his hand around her breast.[\[note: 136\]](#Ftn_136) In addition, he testified that this incident involving the Complainant’s necklace had happened only on 10 January 2017 (_viz_, the date of the Lunchbox Incident), while he was disciplining the Complainant for the first, and only, time, in relation to (among other things) the Lunchbox Incident (which had happened earlier that morning) _and_ a necklace the Complainant was then wearing. For ease of reference, I will use “Sofa Incident” to refer to the accused’s version of the Sofa Incident as well.

### Accused’s testimony

100    Key aspects of the accused’s testimony are set out in this section.

#### Massaged Complainant on only four occasions

101    According to the accused, he had first massaged the Complainant on an occasion sometime after July 2016.[\[note: 137\]](#Ftn_137) He initially said he had massaged her on “\[m\]aybe about 4” occasions.[^138] But, he later said he had massaged her on _only_ four occasions[^139] (and thrice confirmed this to be his position in cross-examination[^140]). He said he had obtained her permission when he massaged her on all these occasions, and that she had never complained of any discomfort whenever he massaged her. According to the accused, all four of these massages had been “offered by” him and “they were all accepted by \[the Complainant\]”.[^141] He testified that his four massages on the Complainant had comprised:[^142]

> (a)     three “point massage\[s\]”, where he had massaged her shoulder, the “muscle along \[her\] spine”, and her “outer thigh”; and

> (b)     only one “proper massage”, where he had massaged her, in her bedroom, from her thigh to her back.[\[note: 143\]](#Ftn_143)

102    The accused denied ever massaging the Complainant in the master bedroom.[\[note: 144\]](#Ftn_144) He testified that the Master Bedroom Incident never happened.[^145]

##### (1)   1st “demonstration” massage in living room

103    The accused recalled going for a sports massage on 28 July 2016. A “couple of weeks later”, he said the Mother then suddenly asked him about this massage while they were watching television with the Complainant in the living room.[\[note: 146\]](#Ftn_146) He therefore demonstrated this massage by performing it on the Mother (while the Complainant sat on the sofa). He said he then massaged the Complainant’s outer thigh (in the presence of the Mother[^147]), while the Complainant sat on a bolster in front of the television. He explained that he had massaged the Complainant after the Mother had told the Complainant to “check \[the Complainant’s\] thigh” as the Complainant had been complaining of backache.[^148] He testified that this was the first ever time he had massaged the Complainant.[^149] He said they had all laughed when he massaged them as “it was so painful…they couldn’t even continue”.[^150]

##### (2)   2nd massage in Complainant’s bedroom

104    According to the accused, he next messaged the Complainant in her bedroom. He said this occasion was the only time he ever massaged the Complainant in her bedroom.[\[note: 151\]](#Ftn_151) He claimed he had been having dinner with his son at the dining table when the Complainant (who was doing her schoolwork at the same table) complained she had a “backache”. He said he asked her how painful it was, and she had replied that it was “very painful” and she “couldn’t sit”. As such, he said he asked her if she recalled the massage he had previously demonstrated on the Mother.[^152] When the Complainant replied in the affirmative, he said he then asked her if she needed him “to release the tension”. She replied “Okay”, and he told her that he would “most likely” commence his massage after putting his son to bed and after their night prayers. He said she replied “Okay”.[^153]

105    According to the accused, he went into the Complainant’s bedroom sometime after 8:30pm following his night prayers. He said the Complainant was “waiting”[\[note: 154\]](#Ftn_154) and expecting him, having accepted his earlier offer of a massage.[^155] He said he was then wearing a T-shirt and a pair of shorts. He testified that he had asked the Complainant “to lie down on her bed, facing the window”, to “align” her body to the edge of the bed, and to bend her leg at a right angle – because “to release…the pain from \[her\] back, \[he needed\] to release the tension in \[her\] thigh muscle”.[^156] According to the accused, he then used his elbow to apply pressure at a point near the Complainant’s knee and slowly inched up her right upper thigh. He said he repeated this action for “less than 5 minutes” and he then checked with the Complainant if her thigh still hurt when he applied pressure on it. He testified that the Complainant said “No” and “Better” in response. He said he then used his elbow to apply pressure on the Complainant’s lower back for about 5 minutes. He claimed that his entire massage session lasted for “less than 15 minutes” and that he had sat on one side of her bed or stood/kneeled at the same side of her bed throughout his massage session. Apart from his elbow, he said that no other parts of his body came into contact with the Complainant during his massage.[^157]

106    The accused said he asked the Complainant, “Is it okay? Better?” when she stopped “react\[ing\] to the pressure” he was applying. He testified that she replied “Yah” and he then stopped massaging her and told her, “Okay, rest”. He said that she did indeed rest as she was “lying in bed”. He claimed he then left her bedroom, went into the living room, and switched on the television.[\[note: 158\]](#Ftn_158)

107    The accused testified that his son was sleeping in the master bedroom; the Helper was inside her bedroom; and the Mother was not in the Flat, when he was massaging the Complainant. He said that the doors to the Complainant’s bedroom and the Helper’s bedroom were both open. He explained that he was sure they were open as it was a “norm” for all the doors to be open. He also said that he had seen the Helper folding clothes in her bedroom.[\[note: 159\]](#Ftn_159)

108    According to the accused, the Mother returned to the Flat at around 9:00pm. He said he was then watching television in the living room while the Complainant was in her bedroom. He claimed that the Mother had given certain instructions to the Helper whereupon he immediately told the Mother that the Complainant had complained “of…back pain again \[and\] today it seems very serious because she said she cannot sit \[and\] she couldn’t do her homework”. He said he also told the Mother that he had “tried to release the pressure…using the technique” and he then asked the Mother “to take a look” at the Complainant as he did not know if she could go to school the next day. The accused said that the Mother then immediately went into the Complainant’s bedroom to check on the Complainant. He testified that he did not hear their conversation but said that he believed the Mother then gave the Complainant “Panadol or something”.[\[note: 160\]](#Ftn_160)

##### (3)   3rd & 4th massages

109    The accused testified that he was unable to recall the order of the last two massages he had performed on the Complainant.[\[note: 161\]](#Ftn_161) That said, he was able to recall what happened during these two massages.

(A)   Massage at dining area in kitchen

110    The accused recalled massaging the Complainant on one occasion while she was seated at the dining table (in the kitchen) and he was standing behind her. He claimed that he had then used his elbow to massage her shoulder blade for “less than a minute” as she “was having a lot of pain on \[her\] shoulder”. According to the accused, the Helper and his son were both present in the Flat while he was massaging the Complainant. As for the Mother, he said that she was then in the master bedroom and he was not sure if she had seen him massaging the Complainant. That said, he testified that the Mother knew he had massaged the Complainant as he had informed the Mother thereafter.[\[note: 162\]](#Ftn_162)

(B)   Massage in living room

111    The accused recalled massaging the Complainant on another occasion, at night, while she was standing in the living room. He said he had seen the Helper rubbing the Complainant’s hand and shoulder with some oil before this. According to the accused, the Mother, who was then not present in the Flat, had previously told the Helper not to do this (as the Father had asked what had happened to the Complainant’s skin when he saw her). On seeing the Helper rubbing the Complainant’s hand and shoulder with oil, the accused said he then asked the Complainant, “Is it so painful or not”. When the Complainant replied in the affirmative, he said he told her, “Come, I try and see whether…I can release, ah”. The Complainant therefore “went out to the living room still visible to \[the Helper\]” and he then used his elbow to massage her shoulder blade and the muscle along her spine “while she was standing and \[his\] son was in between”.[\[note: 163\]](#Ftn_163)

#### Lunchbox Incident & Sofa Incident happened on 10 January 2017

112    According to the accused, the Sofa Incident (or, more accurately, his version of this incident) had taken place on 10 January 2017, and not sometime in 2016. He explained that he was sure of this date as it had been the only occasion on which he had ever disciplined the Complainant. He said he had found the Complainant’s lunch box at the Duct that morning. He took a photo of it and sent the photo to the Mother to inform her that the Complainant had not brought her lunch box to school. He said the Mother then “got a bit affected” and texted the Complainant to “confirm that she \[had\] brought her food packet”. He said the Complainant had initially informed the Mother that she had done so, but realised her lie had been found out when the Mother sent her the photo he had taken.[\[note: 164\]](#Ftn_164)

113    The accused claimed that he spoke to the Complainant about the Lunchbox Incident after dinner on 10 January 2017, while they were both seated on the sofa in the living room. At this time, he said only his son (who was seated on his right) and the Helper (who was in the kitchen) were in the Flat. He testified that the Mother had skipped dinner and gone for a jog as she did not “want to get too emotional”. He said the Mother had been very angry before this and had not joined them for dinner (opting instead to stay in the master bedroom to cool down). He said he had told the Mother to calm down and the Mother then told him to speak to the Complainant first while she went for a jog.[\[note: 165\]](#Ftn_165)

114    According to the accused, he had spoken to the Complainant only about her studies before 10 January 2017. Although the Mother was the disciplinarian in relation to the Complainant, he said that he had spoken to the Complainant about the Lunchbox Incident on the evening of 10 January 2017 because the Mother had “got a bit too emotionally affected” that afternoon after getting into a “heated argument” with the Father when she told him about the Lunchbox Incident. As such, he said he told the Mother she should “step back” and let him discipline the Complainant instead.[\[note: 166\]](#Ftn_166)

115    The accused claimed that he asked the Complainant why she had left her lunchbox at the Duct. He testified that the Complainant replied that she did so because she was “shy” and her friends made fun of her. He said he then tried to explain to the Complainant why the Mother wanted her to bring a lunchbox to school that year, and he also told her that her action of leaving the lunchbox at the Duct was wrong. He testified that he told the Complainant that she could always speak to the Mother and “not do this kind of thing” if she was unhappy with bringing a lunchbox to school. He said that the Complainant was “initially… okay…about the issue” and she also apologised. He claimed that he then told the Complainant firmly, “We took effort to go to market, buy the whole week supply and then not sure if you actually disposed \[of your lunchboxes on\] other days and its hurts, lah.”[\[note: 167\]](#Ftn_167)

116    According to the accused, he then brought up the Complainant’s academic performance and her ambition to become a nurse as well as how they had agreed to make 2017 a better year where they would help each other. He referred to the lunchbox as one of the “effort\[s\] \[they had\] agreed on for \[her\] to save…money to buy something else”. He said he also told the Complainant that the arguments between her biological parents “barely 2 weeks into…2017” affected him”. He also said that the Complainant then looked “more tense” than sad as he spoke. He further said that the Complainant was “very stiff”, had looked at him in a “challenging” way, and had “got a bit agitated”.[\[note: 168\]](#Ftn_168)

117    The accused claimed that things got “even worse” when he brought up the necklace the Complainant was then wearing. According to the accused, he had seen her wearing this necklace on the first day of school in 2017 (3 January 2017) and had asked her why she was doing so when he thought that she was not allowed to do so. He said that the Complainant then assured him that she would remove it. However, he said that he then saw her wearing the necklace to school again the next day (4 January 2017). He said that he then told her once more that he did not think she could wear it to school, but she had not said anything. As such, he said that when he saw her wearing the necklace again on 10 January 2017, he told her, “I have been telling you to remove \[the necklace\] and not to wear it to school \[but\] you still ignore”. The accused testified that things “got a bit tense already” at this point and the Complainant was displaying “challenging” “body language”. He said he told her “I keep telling you this…remove the chain, the necklace, but she said something to the effect of “I’m not wearing it”. As such, he said that he then pulled down the neckline of her T-shirt to expose the chain of the necklace and told her, “This necklace, remove it when you go to school”.[\[note: 169\]](#Ftn_169) The accused denied then looking inside the Complainant’s T-shirt.

118    According to the accused, his entire “talk” with the Complainant took about 15 to 20 minutes. He said he had never spent this amount of time speaking to the Complainant about her behaviour before.[\[note: 170\]](#Ftn_170)

119    Following his “talk” with the Complainant, the accused said that the Mother “took over” and spoke to the Complainant. He said the Mother had returned to the Flat while he was talking to the Complainant and she had been drinking or having dinner at the dining table in the kitchen when he was speaking to the Complainant. He said that he was not sure if the Mother had been observing him and the Complainant during his “talk” with the Complainant. That said, he testified that the Mother had been facing them and he believed that the Mother could hear them (as they were seated about 7m to 8m apart).[\[note: 171\]](#Ftn_171)

### Mother’s testimony

120    Key aspects of the Mother’s testimony are set out in this section.

#### Accused massaged Complainant on only four occasions

121    The Mother initially testified that the accused had massaged the Complainant “a few times”.[\[note: 172\]](#Ftn_172) She later said that he had, to the best of her knowledge, massaged the Complainant “about 4” times. She then said “\[t\]here were 4” such massages to the best of her recollection. She first said that she had been around when all of these massages had taken place. She then said that she “was around for \[only\] 3” of these massages – and, of these three massages, she said she “personally witnessed 2” while she “was at home” when the accused had performed the third massage. As for the fourth massage, the Mother said that she had not been in the Flat when the accused had performed it on the Complainant.[^173]

##### (1)   1st “demonstration” massage in living room

122    According to the Mother, it was “normal” for the accused to massage the Complainant as he had previously done a “sports massage” with one of his friends. The Mother recalled that the accused had come home from “that \[massage\] session” one day in late July 2016 and was “all excited” as that massage had apparently “assisted him to alleviate \[his\] pain”. She said that the accused had then shared how the massage was performed on him while she, their son, the Complainant, and the Helper were watching television in the living room. She also said that the accused had performed the massage on her to show her how it had been performed on him and that the accused’s massage “surprisingly…release\[d\] some tension \[in\] her back”. As such, the Mother said she then told the Complainant, “Eh…you’re also feeling back pain, right? You want Encik to try on you, see whether it release\[s\] your back ache or not?” According to the mother, the accused then performed this “sports massage” on the Complainant. The Mother said that the accused had used his elbow to apply pressure on the Complainant’s back “to release the pain” while his left hand was on the left side of the Complainant’s back. According to the Mother, this was the first time the accused had ever massaged the Complainant.[\[note: 174\]](#Ftn_174)

123    The Mother recalled that the accused had also showed them “pictures” of him and his friend being massaged during his “sharing session” with them. According to the Mother, both the accused and his friend appeared to be in “a lot of pain” and they had all found it “quite funny” that the accused and his friend were “grimacing in pain”. The Mother claimed that they were all “joking” and “making fun” of these “pictures”.[\[note: 175\]](#Ftn_175)

##### (2)   2nd massage at dining area in kitchen

124    The Mother said that the accused had massaged the Complainant, on a second occasion, at the dining area. According to the Mother, she had been in the master bedroom reading a book when the accused entered and told her that he had massaged the Complainant as the Complainant was having “back pain again”. According to the Mother, she then exited the master bedroom and asked the Complainant “how was it?”. The Mother claimed that the Complainant then “mentioned \[to her\] that she got back pain” and she therefore brought the Complainant to see the doctor.[\[note: 176\]](#Ftn_176)

##### (3)   3rd massage in Complainant’s bedroom

125    The Mother was referred to the charge for the Bedroom Incident[\[note: 177\]](#Ftn_177) and told that the Complainant had alleged that “she was molested when \[the accused\] massaged her in her bedroom”. The Mother said she “was aware of the massage”. She said this massage “should” have occurred “after July 2016” as her school term had started only in mid-July 2016. She also said that this was the third occasion on which the accused had massaged the Complainant.[^178]

126    The Mother said she had returned to the Flat sometime between 9:00pm and 10:00pm after her lessons ended. By this time, the massage which the accused had performed on the Complainant had already ended. The Mother said she opened the gate and the main door. On entering the Flat, she said she told the Helper (who was “halfway through the hallway”) that she wanted a hot drink. The Helper then went into the kitchen to make her a drink. The Mother said she then saw the accused “at the hallway”, standing “about 1 metre away or less” from where the Helper had been. He was waiting to greet her. She said he was in a singlet and “soccer shorts”. She also said that she saw that the television was switched on and that the accused “was watching “\[The\] Walking Dead””.[\[note: 179\]](#Ftn_179)

127    According to the Mother, the accused asked her “how was school and all”. She replied by telling him “Lecture\[r\] today not bad. Released us early”. He then told her he had noticed the Complainant “fidgeting in her seat” when she was doing her homework earlier that day and he had thus asked the Complainant why. In response, the Complainant told him that “she got extreme back pain and she can’t sit properly”. The accused then told her he had done a “sports massage” on the Complainant and he asked her to “check on” the Complainant. She thus went into the Complainant’s bedroom to do so.

128    On entering the Complainant’s bedroom, she said she saw the Complainant “lying on the bed, already preparing to sleep”.[\[note: 180\]](#Ftn_180) She asked the Complainant “how are you feeling now” and the Complainant replied that she “felt much better after the massage” and she had “no pain now”. According to the Mother, she then asked the Complainant if she wanted any painkillers. The Complainant replied that painkillers “may help her”. As such, the Mother said she went into the kitchen and asked the Helper if there was any Panadol. The Mother claimed that the Helper checked and informed her that there was no Panadol. The Mother said she then went through the “drug box” and saw some Anarex tablets that had been prescribed to her previously. She took a slab of these tablets and a glass of water and returned to the Complainant’s bedroom. She recalled telling the Complainant that she could only pass her one tablet as this was medication that had been specifically prescribed to her. She told the Complainant to “eat one first” and to monitor her condition the following morning. She said she also told the Complainant that she would bring her to the doctor if her backache remained the next morning. The Mother said she then showered and went to sleep.[^181]

129    The Mother said she remembered this incident because she had given the Complainant “something \[she\] should not be giving her”. According to the Mother, she had “studied in school”, as part of her part-time degree in Biomedical Engineering, that it is “an offence in Singapore to give someone a medication that’s prescribed to you”.[\[note: 182\]](#Ftn_182)

130    According to the Mother, she saw the Complainant the next morning and the Complainant was “already ready for school”. She asked the Complainant about her “back pain” and the Complainant replied that it was “much better”. She said she also asked the Complainant if she still wanted her to bring her to the doctor, but the Complainant said, “it’s okay”. According to the Mother, the Complainant replied similarly when asked “if she still need\[ed\] any Anarex”.[\[note: 183\]](#Ftn_183)

##### (4)   4th massage in living room

131    The Mother testified that the accused had massaged the Complainant on a fourth occasion at the “library” in the living room.[\[note: 184\]](#Ftn_184) She said this was the second massage she had “personally witnessed” (apart from the first in the living room[^185]).

#### Lunchbox Incident & Sofa Incident happened on 10 January 2017

132    According to the Mother, the accused had texted her on the morning of 10 January 2017 to ask if the lunchbox he had found at the Duct belonged to the Complainant. He also sent her a photo of the lunchbox at the Duct. The Mother said she then asked the accused to open up the lunchbox and confirm with the Helper if it contained the food the Helper had packed for the Complainant.[\[note: 186\]](#Ftn_186) The Helper apparently confirmed this to be the case. The Mother said she then texted the Complainant to check with her if she had brought her lunchbox to school that day.[^187] She also texted the Father as the Complainant had replied that it was her Father who had allowed her to not bring her lunchbox.[^188] According to the Mother, her exchange with the Father[^189] made her upset.[^190] She shared this exchange with the accused[^191], telling him that it made her so upset that she could not work. She also told the accused that she had given up on the Complainant, that she was “very tired”, and asked how she could “continue this fight alone”. At this stage, the Mother said the accused asked to “intervene” to speak to the Complainant. The Mother said that the accused was “trying to gain \[her\] permission \[to\] allow him to intervene, to do the disciplining of \[the Complainant\] instead”. She said she agreed to allow the accused to do so. She also said that the accused had never disciplined the Complainant before as they had “a prior agreement that all disciplining \[would\] be done by \[her\]”.[^192]

133    That evening, the Mother said she stayed in the master bedroom and did not join the Complainant and the accused for dinner as she was “not in the mood for dinner”. After dinner, the Mother said that the accused “mentioned about wanting to speak to \[the Complainant\]”. She told him “Hold on first, let me get out of the house first” as she did not know how she would react then. She therefore left the Flat at about 7:00pm to go for a run. When she returned to the Flat sometime before 8:00pm (after being away for “about half an hour”), the Mother said she saw the accused, her son, and the Complainant sitting on the sofa. She “went to the dining area to grab…a drink and…sat at the dining table to face them”. She said that the accused was seated in the middle of the sofa, with his back facing her. The Complainant was seated on his left. Both were facing each other at an angle.[\[note: 193\]](#Ftn_193)

134    The Mother said she was seated about 10m away from the Complainant and she had a clear view of the Complainant’s “facial expression” and the accused’s “hand gestures”. She also said that she could see the Complainant’s chest. According to the Mother, the Complainant “appeared unhappy” and “gave that look like she want\[ed\] to challenge” the accused. The Mother said that she could not make out the accused’s “full sentences but…heard him mentioning about the necklace”. She also said that she saw the accused “pulling…the front collar of \[the Complainant’s\] \[round-necked\] T-shirt” down by about 2cm to 3cm. According to the Mother, the Complainant looked “unhappy” when the accused did that (but she did not do anything else).[\[note: 194\]](#Ftn_194) The Mother testified that the Complainant had received this necklace from her Father as a birthday gift sometime between 1 and 20 December 2016 when the Complainant had stayed with him. The Mother also testified that the accused could not have looked into the Complainant’s tee-shirt because he would then have to have “a certain height to look into” and she “would have noticed that”. She said that the accused had, however, remained in a seated position all the while and “only his hand \[had\] move\[d\]”.[^195]

135    After the accused was “done” with the Complainant, the Mother said she asked to speak to the Complainant. While the Complainant was walking towards her, the Mother said she looked at the accused and mouthed the words “What happened” to him. The Mother said that the accused had mouthed “Still wearing the necklace” in response.[\[note: 196\]](#Ftn_196)

136    According to the Mother, she then sat down with the Complainant and spoke to her about why she was “lying”, the Lunchbox Incident, “black shoes”, and the necklace. She said she explained to the Complainant that a lunchbox was packed for her so she did not have to miss her lunch. She said she also told the Complainant that she should have at least spoken to her if she did not want to bring a lunchbox instead of “throwing it away”. As for the necklace, the Mother said that she told the Complainant that it was a “very expensive gift” from her Father and that she should wear it during the weekend and not when she was in school. The Mother testified that the Complainant was “very angry” when she was speaking to her. She said she had “never seen that face from \[the Complainant\] before” as usually the Complainant would be “very apologetic” whenever she was spoken to. This time round, however, the Mother said that the Complainant “was very different” and would have hit her if she could. The Mother speculated that the Complainant might have been “just angry” with her and the accused “for interfering with her life”.[\[note: 197\]](#Ftn_197)

137    On seeing the Complainant’s reaction, the Mother said she “got angry back again” (after having “cooled down” after her run). At that point, she recalled that the Complainant had mentioned to her that afternoon that her teacher had wanted to speak to her about her CCA. She therefore asked the Complainant what the teacher had wanted to raise. In response, the Complainant said, “Don’t know” and that got her “even more angry”. The Mother said she then “threatened”, for the “first time”, “to send \[the Complainant\] to a girl’s home if she refused to change her ways”. The Mother said that the Complainant “broke down and cried” when she heard this threat.[\[note: 198\]](#Ftn_198)

## Reasons for convictions

138    I now discuss why I convicted the accused on all three charges. I first review the rule of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I then explain why I applied the “unusually convincing” standard to the Complainant’s evidence, to assess whether the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. I end by analysing the evidence put before the court and explain why I found the Complainant’s evidence “unusually convincing”.

### Prosecution’s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt

139    The Prosecution had to prove the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This entailed that on a consideration of all the evidence presented by the Prosecution and/or the Defence, the evidence must be sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, every element of the offences with which the accused was charged (_Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP_[\[note: 199\]](#Ftn_199) (“_Jagatheesan_”) at \[48\]). But the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that the Prosecution must dispel all conceivable doubts. The question in all cases is whether such doubts are real or reasonable, or whether they are merely fanciful. It is only when such doubts are real or reasonable that the Prosecution has not discharged its burden, and the accused is entitled to an acquittal (_Teo Keng Pong v PP_[^200]).

140    A reasonable doubt is one for which a reason can be given, so long as that reason is logically connected to the evidence adduced (_PP v GCK_[\[note: 201\]](#Ftn_201) (“_GCK_”) at \[131\]). The principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt mandates that those doubts for which there is a reason – relatable to and supported by the evidence adduced – must be excluded. A reasoned doubt must exist for an acquittal.

### Complainant’s testimony had to be “unusually convincing”

141    It was not disputed that the Complainant’s evidence had to be “unusually convincing” for the Prosecution to prove its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. This standard meant that the Complainant’s evidence had to be sufficient, in and of itself, to overcome any reasonable doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration (_PP v Wee Teong Boo_[\[note: 202\]](#Ftn_202) (“_Wee Teong Boo_”) at \[44\]). The Complainant’s evidence would be “unusually convincing” if that evidence, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth that leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused (_PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_[^203] (“_Liton_”)). In assessing the Complainant’s credibility, I was mindful that there is no prescribed way in which victims of sexual assault are expected to act (_Wee Teong Boo_ at \[55\]). Indeed, such victims may not react in the same way as other victims of crime (_PP v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan_[^204] (“_Mohd Ariffan_”) at \[62\]).

142    Strict corroboration in the _Baskerville_ sense is not required locally. Instead, a liberal approach to corroboration is adopted, which focuses on the substance, relevance, and confirmatory value of the evidence in question (_GCK_ at \[96\]). The forms of corroboration were discussed in _Haliffie bin Mamat v PP_ (“_Haliffie_”)[\[note: 205\]](#Ftn_205):

> 30    Where the complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, “an accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s story” (_AOF_ at \[173\]). In _Liton_ at \[42\] and \[43\], this court discussed the meaning of “corroborative evidence”:

>> 42    As to what can amount to corroborative evidence, the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) did not, at its inception, provide a definition of corroboration and still does not do so. However, by virtue of s 2(2), the common law is imported into the Evidence Act unless it is inconsistent with the Act’s tenor and provisions. **There is thus legal justification for the judicial adoption of the common law definition of corroboration laid down in the oft-cited English decision of** **_R v Baskerville_** **<span class="citation">\[1916\] 2 KB 658</span> at 667**, **_ie_****, independent evidence implicating the accused in a material particular.**

>> 43    However, it is clear that **the** **_Baskerville_** **standard** (as set out in the preceding paragraph) **does not apply in its strict form in Singapore since Yong CJ, in** **_Tang Kin Seng_** **\[****_v PP_** **<span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 444</span>\], advocated a liberal approach in determining whether a particular piece of evidence can amount to corroboration**.…

> **This more “liberal approach” to corroboration treats subsequent complaints made by the complainant herself as corroboration** **provided that “the statement \[implicating\] the \[accused\] was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence”** (_Public Prosecutor v Mardai_ <span class="citation">\[1950\] MLJ 33</span> at 33, cited in _AOF_ at \[173\]).

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

143    There was no evidence corroborative in the _Baskerville_ sense in this case. The evidence adduced also did not satisfy the more liberal approach to corroboration – because the Complainant’s subsequent complaints to her Stepmother, her Teacher, and the Counsellor were not made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offences.[\[note: 206\]](#Ftn_206) In addition, the Stepmother, the Teacher, and the Counsellor had no personal knowledge of the truth of the Complainant’s allegation(s). They were merely repeating what she had told them. Their evidence on the Complainant’s complaints was hence hearsay evidence and not admissible as evidence of the truth of her allegation(s). In any event, the Complainant’s subsequent repeated complaints could not, in and of themselves, constitute independent corroborative evidence to dispense with the requirement for “unusually convincing” evidence (_Wee Teong Boo_ at \[46\] and _Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP_[^207] at \[44\]-\[51\]). I thus applied the “unusually convincing” standard to the Complainant’s evidence, to assess if the Prosecution had proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

### No reasonable doubt arose

144    A reasonable doubt may arise (_GCK_ (at \[134\]-\[135\]):

> (a)     from “within the case mounted by the Prosecution”; or

> (b)     on an assessment of the “totality of the evidence”.

145    No reasonable doubt arose on both fronts in this case.

#### No reasonable doubt had arisen within the Prosecution’s case

146    The term proof beyond a reasonable doubt “within the case mounted by the Prosecution” denotes the evaluative task of considering all the evidence adduced by the Prosecution at each stage of the proceedings (_GCK_ at \[134\]). A reasonable doubt may arise from “within the case mounted by the Prosecution” in at least two situations (_GCK_ at \[136\]):

> …\[G\]iven that the legal burden lies on the Prosecution throughout a trial, as part of its own case, the Prosecution must adduce sufficient evidence to establish the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on at least a _prima facie_ basis. One example of a failure to do so would be where, after the Defence has been called, there are discrepancies in the accused person’s testimony, but there remain significant inconsistencies _in the Prosecution’s case_ that nevertheless generate a reasonable doubt. In such a situation, the court would be obliged to acquit the accused person. Another example would be where the Prosecution’s evidence is so weak that, at the close of the Prosecution’s case, it falls below the \[_Haw Tua Tau and other v PP_ \[1981\]-\[1982\] SLR(R) 133\] standard. The court would then be entitled to find that there is no case to answer even without calling upon the Defence.

> \[emphasis in italics in original\]

147    The inquiry into whether a reasonable doubt has arisen from “within the case mounted by the Prosecution” may include (_GCK_ at \[137\] and _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP_[\[note: 208\]](#Ftn_208) at \[9\]):

> (a)     the witness’s demeanour.

> (b)     an assessment of the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of the witness’s evidence; and

> (c)     an assessment of the external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of the witness’s evidence and the extrinsic evidence (for instance, the evidence of other witnesses and documentary evidence).

148    The Prosecution’s case hinged on the Complainant’s evidence. I was mindful that she was a child at the time of the alleged offences (when she was about 13 years old) and when she later testified (when she was about 16½ years old).[\[note: 209\]](#Ftn_209) She was also testifying in the formal setting of a courtroom for the first time. I had closely observed her as she testified over two days, where she was subjected to intense cross-examination. She struck me as a timid[^210] and simple girl. She was not particularly eloquent, but she was reasonably articulate and was able to relate events coherently and express her feelings at and around the time they happened. She impressed me as a mature, sensible, and reasonable witness who was fair in her testimony. She was not evasive and answered all the questions posed to her directly. In the face of relatively lengthy and rigorous cross-examination (which might also have been somewhat confusing for her as the Defence’s questions tended to jump between the incidents without much forewarning), she was firm and consistent in her allegations against the accused.

149    That said, I was conscious that it is the totality of the evidence that must be considered in determining the reliability and credibility of a witness’s evidence (_Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd_[\[note: 211\]](#Ftn_211)). In this regard, I was aware of the dangers of relying excessively on the Complainant’s demeanour (and that of all the other witnesses who testified, including the accused). I was also mindful of taking issue with faulty recollections on the witnesses’ part in assessing the veracity of their evidence. After all, they were testifying between approximately three and four years after the alleged events – and adequate allowance had to be accorded to human fallibility in retention and recollection (_PP v Singh Kalpanath_[^212] (“_Kalpanath_”) at \[54\] and \[60\]).

##### (1)   Complainant was consistent on Bedroom Incident

150    I have set out the Complainant’s testimony on the Bedroom Incident in some detail above. I found her testimony in examination-in-chief and cross-examination materially consistent. Key aspects of her testimony were also materially consistent with the Note she wrote in the counselling room on 13 January 2017, nearly 2½ years before she testified in early July 2019.[\[note: 213\]](#Ftn_213) Her Note and her later testimony were also consistent on the fact that the accused had massaged her a few times _before_ the Bedroom Incident. I reproduce, below, the relevant portion of this Note which related to the Bedroom Incident:[^214]

> …Then there is one night where I agreed to his massage and \[he\] ordered me to sleep. He later ask\[ed\] if it hurts but I didn’t reply him because I was too tired to do so. After \[he asked me this question the third time\], he start\[ed\] to get more touchy. **He beg\[a\]n to stroke my legs, my tummy and then he grope\[d\] on my chest. I was shocked and I had no idea what to do but to stay still. He continued to grope me and I heard him pulling his shorts down and a lot of scenarios played in my head \[and\] then the next thing I knew, something hard was rubbing against my pants and it took me a few seconds to realise what it \[was\]. I wanted to cry but held my tears back and prayed to \[G\]od. God did answer\[\] my prayers because my step dad quickly walk\[ed\] away when he heard my mom unlocking the house door**…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

151    The Complainant’s testimony on the Bedroom Incident was also frank, unembellished, and fair to the accused. She _readily_:

> (a)     testified that he had:[\[note: 215\]](#Ftn_215)

>> (i)       not used much force when he grabbed her right breast.

>> (ii)       not made skin-to-skin contact with her right breast.

>> (iii)       never beaten or scolded her, and even agreed with the Defence that he was hence “a nice person in a sense”.

>> (iv)       never threatened her “not to say anything to anyone after the massage in \[the\] bedroom”.

> (b)     admitted that she:[\[note: 216\]](#Ftn_216)

>> (i)       could not recall if he had also grabbed her left breast.

>> (ii)       did not see what he was doing after she heard him purportedly unbuckling his pants.

>> (iii)       was not sure what was “poking against her butt”.

152    She also _readily_ admitted that the Mother would scold her for lying. Indeed, she even proceeded to unhesitatingly list the lies she had told the Mother:[\[note: 217\]](#Ftn_217)

> **Q:**      **…Witness, you also said that you have been scolded \[by your Mother\] for telling lies?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **What type of lies?**

> **A:**      **Um, like, um, I’m…staying in school but instead I’m actually, like, outside at a nearby…shopping centre with my friends and another lie, is that I told her that I was staying, but, instead I was doing another things like, um, playing with my phone or reading my books.**

> Q:    And why do you \[do\] that Why you tell lies?

> A:    Because…I…feel like she wouldn’t understand me if I told her the truth and therefore I lied.

> Q:    So it is you who think your mother would not understand you?

> A:    I did told her the truth before and she got angry over it, so it makes me think that if I were to tell the truth again, she would not understand.

> **Q:**      **What did you tell to your mother that made her angry?**

> **A:**      **\[T\[here were once where I told her that…I was in school …studying but then, I was actually outside school and then, I’m not sure how she found out but in the end she did. And another one was, when I told…her that I went for \[a religious class on a weekday) it but instead I was with my friends.**

> Q:    So, she got angry \[with you\] over you lying?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And that is why you do not tell her things?

> A:    Yes.

> …

> **Q:**      **Okay. You started living with \[the accused and your Mother in\] December…2014…After that, what are the occasions you get severely scolded by your mother?**

> **A:**      **Um, another time when she found out that I was lying to her. Um, she suddenly talked about selling me---again, she talk about selling me off.**

> Q:    Selling me off?

> A:    Yes, which makes me feel very sad to hear from my own mother.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

153    But, she firmly denied the Defence’s allegation that she was lying about the Three Incidents.[\[note: 218\]](#Ftn_218)

(A)   Omissions to Teacher did not dent credibility

154    The Complainant had also informed her Teacher on 11 January 2017 of the accused’s most intrusive act during the Bedroom Incident – namely, that he had “slipped his hand under her top and massaged her breast”. She also told her Teacher that the Bedroom Incident stopped only when the Mother returned to the Flat.[\[note: 219\]](#Ftn_219)

155    The Teacher never testified that the Complainant told her that the accused had used his leg to caress her calves and his hand to stroke her tummy. Neither did the Teacher say that the Complainant had told her that she heard the accused unbuckling his pants and then felt “something hard poking against her butt”. These omissions were not, strictly speaking, inconsistent. The Complainant had simply not provided a detailed account of the Bedroom Incident to her Teacher. In any event, these omissions did not dent her credibility. This was for three reasons.

156     First, I was mindful that a victim of sexual assault – such as the Complainant – cannot always be expected to provide a completely similar and full account every time she discloses the offence(s) to another. The Complainant’s failure to provide a detailed account to her Teacher was understandable as behaviour commonly displayed by victims of sexual abuse (_Mohd Ariffan_ at \[78\]-\[80\]). In this regard, I noted that the Complainant had candidly testified that she did not remember if she had elaborated to her Teacher about how the accused had molested her during the Bedroom Incident.[\[note: 220\]](#Ftn_220) She never hid the fact that she might not have provided a detailed account of the offences to her Teacher. Indeed, she simply testified that she told her Teacher that the accused had “molested” her.[^221]

157     Second, I was conscious of the backdrop against which the Complainant made her disclosure to her Teacher. It was, after all, her _first_ time speaking to someone she was not particularly close to about what the accused had done to her. This would have been a very difficult and uncomfortable experience for a 14-year-old girl (who had already found it difficult to provide details to her Stepmother, a person she was close to[\[note: 222\]](#Ftn_222)). The Complainant’s disclosure to her Teacher had also taken place in an unplanned setting, where she did not know beforehand that the Teacher would be speaking to her.[^223] Her decision to confide in her Teacher[^224], somewhere in the middle of a short 30-minute session[^225], was thus an impromptu one – where she would not have had the time to collect her thoughts and tell her Teacher about everything the accused had done to her.

158    Indeed, had the Complainant intended to falsely implicate the accused, she would have actively sought out the Teacher to do so (and not passively wait to do so during a chance session she had no prior inkling of). She would also have readily furnished a detailed account to her Teacher at the _start_ of their session. Yet, however, she did so only during the middle of their session and only after the Teacher probed her for details (as she had initially only told the Teacher that “something” had happened to her in mid-2016). The Teacher also testified that the Complainant was “hesitant” and “scared” when relaying this incident to her and had not wanted to elaborate.[\[note: 226\]](#Ftn_226) The Counsellor had also testified that the Complainant was “quite emotional” during their session on 13 January 2017. All of these aspects – which were not challenged by the Defence – added weight to the Complainant’s testimony, because it was implausible that she not only lied about her encounter(s) with the accused, but also knew months ahead of a court appearance that she should conduct herself in a particular way before third parties to create an appearance of credibility (_GDC v PP_[^227] (“_GDC_”) at \[14\]).

159     Third, this was not a case where the Complainant had omitted these details despite lengthy and constant probing by her Teacher. Her session with her Teacher had lasted for only about 30 minutes, and her disclosure in relation to the accused was made only in the middle of this session. The Teacher had also testified that she did not ask the Complainant if the incident she relayed was the only incident which made her uncomfortable. In this regard, the Teacher had testified that she did not probe the Complainant further because the bell had rung and she had to rush off to see the Principal and to attend to her remaining lessons.[\[note: 228\]](#Ftn_228)

(B)   Failure to react or seek help not unreasonable

160    The Defence submitted that the Complainant’s failure to seek help from the Helper or the Mother created a reasonable doubt within the Prosecution’s case:[\[note: 229\]](#Ftn_229)

> (a)     In relation to the Helper, the Defence noted the Complainant’s testimony that the Helper’s bedroom was next to her bedroom. She had also said that the occupant of one bedroom would be able to hear the occupant in the adjacent bedroom if the latter “talks loudly”.[\[note: 230\]](#Ftn_230) As the Complainant “did not shout or seek help \[from the Helper\] during or after” the Bedroom Incident, the Defence argued that this showed she “felt no discomfort” during the incident and “no outrage of modesty had taken place”.[^231]

> (b)     In relation to the Mother, the Defence noted that the Complainant was awake and alert to the fact that the Mother had returned to the Flat[\[note: 232\]](#Ftn_232) after the incident in her bedroom. According to the Defence, her “failure to approach/seek help from \[the Mother\]” showed that “nothing untoward” had happened to her during the massage in her bedroom.[^233]

161    The Defence also took issue with her failure to push the accused away although she said she felt uncomfortable when he was touching her chest.[\[note: 234\]](#Ftn_234)

162    These submissions were not persuasive. They were premised on the notion that victims of sexual offences should react in a certain manner. They assumed that because the Complainant’s behaviour at and around the time of the Bedroom Incident was apparently atypical of a victim of a sexual offence, her allegations against the accused were thus false. But victims of sexual offences cannot be straitjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner. There is no list of checkboxes of expected, or known, behaviour to be ticked off when assessing the truthfulness of a victim of a sexual offence.[\[note: 235\]](#Ftn_235) The fact that the Complainant was a sexually inexperienced 13-year-old girl at the time of the incident, who was very likely taken aback by the accused’s unexpected and brazen conduct while alone with him in the confines of a bedroom in his Flat, meant that her reaction was well within the realm of possibilities and perfectly foreseeable (_GBR v PP_ (“_GBR_”) at \[20\]).[^236] In this regard, I was also guided by the following observations in _Chng Yew Chin v PP_[^237], a case in which a 28-year-old helper was molested by her employer’s 43-year-old husband:

> …**\[A\] victim of molest ought not to be penalised or her credibility prejudiced merely because** shame, **discomfort or fear has prevented her from telling her story immediately or soon thereafter. Any reason that impedes such disclosure will always be a question of fact that can be explained or clarified plausibly by the temperament and/or character of a complainant. To suggest, as a general proposition, that a victim of molest must immediately report her situation** even if it is to a mere acquaintance, **is totally unrealistic and reflects a patent lack of appreciation for the plight and dilemma of victims of sexual assault.** In fact, such as submission by counsel has unsheathed a sword that could cut both ways. It might also be contended quite plausibly on the other hand that if the complainant was indeed bent on ensuring that the allegations she had fabricated would stick, she _would have_ told Lina about the incidents so as to establish a prior and consistent pattern of molestation by the \[accused\].

> \[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold\]

163    In the context of a 13-year-old child, such as the Complainant, the following observations in _PP v Yue Roger Jr_[\[note: 238\]](#Ftn_238) were especially apposite:

> 31    The Victim’s behaviour in the present case in continuing with her rope skipping training with the Accused until 2010 may at first blush seem odd given that she was the victim of repeated sexual abuse. So was the fact that after one instance of sexual intercourse, she went on to go for training as per normal. However, **all this must be seen in the light of the fact that the Victim was at the material time a child of just 13 years**, for whom training and competing with the Accused’s private rope skipping team was the centrepiece of her life and, indeed, her aspirations for the future. **While the average adult may be expected to react in a particular way – for example, to resist, report or complain about an assault as soon as possible – a child…cannot be expected to always react similarly. The thinking process, assumptions and viewpoint of a child…victim may lead to a course of action that may on its face appear unreasonable or improbable to an adult. However, the court must always be mindful of the reasons behind what may seem like unexpected conduct on the part of a child…victim, and should not measure a child…by adult standards.**

> 32     **What the court should do is to assess, given the evidence in respect of the specific complainant and the allegations made, whether what is put forward is consonant with the likely probabilities. A child…complainant may not be expected to complain if…she feels vulnerable, or is otherwise focused on matters other than protecting…her modesty. A child…is by definition immature, and should not, in the absence of evidence showing otherwise, be held to the measure of an adult**. The thought processes and concerns of a child…may also continue to evolve and permutate as…she matures, such that it may be some time before…she is in a position to complain.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

164    I was mindful that the Complainant never said she was close to the Helper. In any event, the Helper was in her own bedroom with the door closed/locked at the time of the Bedroom Incident.[\[note: 239\]](#Ftn_239) She also never said that the Helper had exited her bedroom after the incident or when/after the Mother returned to the Flat. In addition, she had explained that she did not make any noise (such as to scream/shout for help) or try to run away during the incident because she was “scared” that the accused would do something worse to her if she did.[^240] Indeed, she repeatedly testified that she was “scared” during the incident.[^241] The Complainant was just a 13-year-old girl while the accused was a physically larger[^242] man in his mid-thirties at the time of the Bedroom Incident. Given her meek nature and bearing in mind that fear is an emotional response and emotions are not always rational (_BMD v PP_[^243]), I did not find it irrational that a young girl such as the Complainant did not scream/shout and/or seek help from the Helper. Neither did I find it unbelievable that she did not push the accused away while he was groping her breast although she said she felt uncomfortable. In this regard, I was also mindful of “tonic immobility” – described in _GCK_ at \[111\] as follows:

> …Academic literature…shows that **at the moment of sexual assault, a substantial number of victims may experience “tonic immobility”**, which is an involuntary temporary state of inhibition. In other words, **instead of the usual “fight or flight” response, some victims may “freeze” in intense fear**…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

165    I also did not find it irrational that the Complainant had failed to approach the Mother for help when she returned to the Flat. This was in light of her consistent testimony – which was _not_ challenged by the Defence when she testified – that she was not close to the Mother and was, indeed, also scared of her.[\[note: 244\]](#Ftn_244) Her testimony on this aspect was also consistent with:

> (a)     the Teacher’s _unchallenged_ testimony that the Complainant had informed her on 11 January 2017 that her relationship with the Mother was “not very good” and that they were “not close”.[\[note: 245\]](#Ftn_245)

> (b)     the Counsellor’s _unchallenged_ testimony that the Complainant had informed her on 13 January 2017 that her relationship with the Mother was “not good”/“not close”.[\[note: 246\]](#Ftn_246)

> (c)     the Stepmother’s _unchallenged_ testimony that the Complainant was frightened of the Mother. [\[note: 247\]](#Ftn_247)

166    In addition, I was mindful of the Complainant’s testimony that:

> (a)     the accused would have been around the Mother after the Mother returned to the Flat.

> (b)     she was a “young and…very scared and timid and intimidated girl”, who was “afraid at the thought of…going to the police station”.

> (c)     she was afraid that the Mother would not believe her and that the Mother would even hit her if she told the Mother about what had happened.

> (d)     she did not get a chance to see the Mother alone thereafter.

> (e)     she did not get a chance to talk to the Mother as the Mother was very busy and was “always on her phone” even when she was at home.

167    I set out the Complainant’s testimony on these aspects:[\[note: 248\]](#Ftn_248)

> Q:    And after the \[Bedroom Incident\] you also did not tell your mother?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Okay, after the \[Bedroom Incident\], your mother was she at home?

> A:    Um, at night.

> Q:    You saw her?

> A:    No.

> Q:    How do you know if…she’s at home at night?

> A:    ‘Cause I hear her.

> Q:    You’re awake.

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **You didn’t go and tell your mother that stepfather did this?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **Why?**

> **A:**      **Because at that point of time he was with her.**

> **Q:**      **Right.**

> **A:**      **And I know that even if I told her she wouldn’t believe me.**

> Q:    This is something you assume?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So, in the next 2, 3 days, you didn’t get to see your mother alone?**

> **A:**      **No**.

> …

> **Q:**      **You were below 14?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    And you already know that what the…accused…has done to you is not right?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **Why didn’t you tell anyone?**

> **A:**      **‘Cause I was young and I was very scared and timid and intimidated girl. So, I was scared of the consequences.**

> **Q:**      **What consequences?**

> **A:**      **I was scared---I was afraid at the thought of me…going to the police station. I was afraid at the thought of my mum hitting me. I was afraid of the thought that my mum won’t believe me.**

> …

> Q:    Alright. So, from the \[Bedroom Incident\] to the \[subsequent Master Bedroom Incident\] is a few months.

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **And not even on 1 occasion you had a chance to talk to your mother?**

> **A:**      **No, she…was very busy at that point.**

> **Q:**      **She was busy 24 hours of the day?**

> **A:**      **Even when she’s at home she’s always on her phone.**

> **Q:**      **And December \[2016\], you went to Kuala Lumpur with her, whole family. Also didn’t have chance…\[d\]idn’t also have chance to talk to her?**

> **A:**      **No.** [^249]

> **Q:**      **So, is there any occasion your mum has asked you how are you feeling at home?**

> **A:**      **At home, no.**

> **Q:**      **So not even 1 occasion?**

> **A:**      **No, she just ask about school.**

> …

> **Q:**      **So…you do talk to your mother?**

> **A:**      **Yes, but not alone.**

> **Q:**      **Who will be there?**

> **A:**      **Either my little brother or my maid or my stepfather.**

> **Q:**      **Either one?**

> **A:**      **Yah**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

(C)   Lack of specific date/month did not dent credibility

168    The Defence took issue with the Complainant’s “inability \[in her Note\] to give a specific date, or even the month” that the Bedroom Incident happened.[\[note: 250\]](#Ftn_250) It further asserted that the Complainant’s explanation as to why she could not remember “the date or even timeframe” of the Bedroom Incident was “flimsy”.[^251]

169    I disagreed. The Complainant never testified on the specific date or month that the Bedroom Incident had happened. All she said was that this incident happened sometime before her 14th birthday on 21 December 2016.[\[note: 252\]](#Ftn_252) In this regard, I was of the view that some allowance should be accorded to human fallibility in retention and recollection.[^253] Such an allowance was appropriate in the present case as the Complainant’s testimony meant that a number of months could have passed between the Bedroom Incident and the time she wrote the Note (on 13 January 2017). As such, it was not unreasonable that she might have had some difficulty recalling the specific date or month of the Bedroom Incident.[^254] In this regard, she had testified that she had a “bad memory when it comes to date\[s\] and times”.[^255] I therefore found that her inability to recall specific dates and months did not adversely affect the veracity and weight of her evidence. This was particularly in light of her testimony that she nevertheless remembered the “physical things” the accused had done to her:[^256]

> Q:    …The \[Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident\], \[you said they happened in\] year 2016.

> …

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    \[M\[onth?

> A:    I don’t remember. I don’t remember.

> Q:    See, now it’s 2019, July.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Quite a long period of time.

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **But when you made the \[Report\] in 2017 January…close to 2016. Do you agree…a few months \[later\]? How come you do not remember the month?**

> **A:**      **Because it was long and I don’t really remember things well.**

> **Q:**      **So what are the things you can remember? What are the things you can’t remember?**

> **A:**      **Like the physical things that he did** **.**

> **Q:**      **You can remember?**

> **A:**      **Yes** **.**

> **Q:**      **What are the things you cannot remember?**

> **A:**      **Like the date and time.**

> Q:    But---sorry to say, you don’t get molested every day. Do you agree with me?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **\[And\] when something serious happen\[s\] \[to a person\] they tend to remember do you agree?**

> **A:**      **Yes, but I did remember** **what---**

> Q:    No—no, yah, I’ll come there---I’ll come there. Do you agree people remember something miserable---something drastic to their lifestyle?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And molest is one of the incident\[s\].

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **So, I’m just wondering, how come you cannot remember which month of 2016 \[the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident happened\] when the \[Report\] was made \[in\] 2017 only?**

> **A:**      **Like I said, I have a bad memory when it comes to date\[s\] and times.**

> **Q:**      **Well, you got a good memory \[of the\] navy blue t-shirt \[you said you were wearing during the Sofa Incident\].[^257]**

> **A:**      **Cause I see---I physically see it.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

170    The Complainant’s testimony on this aspect was not improbable. It was reasonable that she remembered the serious and intrusive “physical things” the accused had done to her (which, in the words of the Defence, were “so significantly scary and traumatising”[\[note: 258\]](#Ftn_258) for her) instead of the specific dates/months these “physical things” had happened. Indeed, the Complainant could have easily aligned herself with the month the Counsellor had written on the Note in relation to the Bedroom Incident (as the Note was already before her)[^259] when she was pressed by the Defence. That she did not do so was, to my mind, reflective of a witness who was genuinely unable to remember and who did not wish to otherwise mislead the court with untruthful testimony.

171    The Defence had also contended that the date of the Bedroom Incident was not stated in the subsequent Report on 18 January 2017.[\[note: 260\]](#Ftn_260) I noted that a date was, in fact, stated in the Report (“18/07/2016”) under “Date/Time Of Incident”. However, the Complainant was never questioned on this aspect by the Prosecution or the Defence. The information that appeared in the Report had also been typed down by the “counter officer” at the NPC.[^261] But, this officer was never called to explain why he had stated this date in the Report. The Defence’s contention in this regard was hence neither here nor there.

172    In any event, the Complainant’s inability to recall the date or month of the Three Incidents did not materially affect the charges – which were all worded such that references to the date or month of the offences were in general terms. Having regard to the charges as initially framed[\[note: 262\]](#Ftn_262) and amended[^263], the Prosecution was not required to adduce evidence from the Complainant on the specific dates or months of the incidents to discharge its burden of proof (_Ang Lilian v PP_[^264]).

##### (2)   Complainant was consistent on Master Bedroom Incident

173    The Complainant’s testimony on the Master Bedroom Incident has been detailed above. As with the Bedroom Incident, I found her testimony in examination-in-chief and cross-examination materially consistent. Her testimony on the Master Bedroom Incident was also unembellished and fair to the accused. She _readily_ testified that:[\[note: 265\]](#Ftn_265)

> (a)     she did not see what he was doing when she heard him unbuckling and pulling down his pants.

> (b)     he never threatened her or asked her “not to say anything to anyone after the incident \[or\] about the incident”.

> (c)     he never shut or locked the door to the master bedroom when she was inside the bedroom.

(A)   Omissions did not dent credibility

174    The Defence asserted that the Complainant’s testimony was internally inconsistent because the charge[\[note: 266\]](#Ftn_266) did not refer to the word “grab” and the accused’s “forceful dragging of her” into the master bedroom. It also asserted that she had testified on these facts only in cross-examination.[^267] These assertions had no basis. The Complainant _had_ testified in examination-in-chief that the accused had grabbed her arm and pulled her into the master bedroom.[^268] In any event, I did not see why the Complainant should be faulted on a charge the Prosecution had drafted.

175    The Complainant had agreed that the Counsellor had told her to “write everything down”. But, she also readily admitted that she had described only the Bedroom Incident in the Note.[\[note: 269\]](#Ftn_269) In this regard, the Defence contended that her testimony was internally inconsistent because she had not referred to the Master Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident in the Note.[^270] According to the Defence, this was “especially remarkable” as the Master Bedroom Incident “seemed far more severe” than the Bedroom Incident.[^271] These omissions were not, strictly speaking, inconsistent. The Complainant had simply not penned the Master Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident down in the Note. In any event, I did not think that this dented her credibility. This was for two reasons.

176     First, I accepted the Complainant’s explanation that she had not penned the Master Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident down in the Note because she knew (when she was writing the Note) that she would eventually have to relate everything to the police at the police station (which she said she did). According to the Complainant, this was because the Counsellor had informed her, before she started penning the Note, that the Counsellor would be asking the Principal to “call the child protection officer” down to the School and that “they” would then “bring \[her\] to the police station to make a report”. As such, the Complainant said she thought it would be “okay” if she did not write everything down in the Note and pen only the Bedroom Incident down as it had affected her the most.[\[note: 272\]](#Ftn_272) In this regard, I was mindful of the Counsellor’s testimony that she had told the Complainant to “write down what was bothering her”.[^273] I was also conscious of the fact that the Note was not an investigation statement the Complainant was furnishing to the police. It was a document the Counsellor had asked her to pen at the start of a counselling session. The Complainant was therefore not aware, when she was writing the Note, as to whether the Note was meant for the police. Indeed, had she planned to falsely implicate the accused, she would have readily detailed all the Three Incidents in the Note or, at least, referred to them in the Note. She would not have only referred to the Bedroom Incident. Relevant extracts of the Complainant’s testimony, where she explained why she did not pen the Master Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident down in the Note, are set out below:[^274]

> Q:    Can you point out where in this \[Note\], you ever made references to the \[Sofa Incident\].

> A:    I didn’t write it down.

> …

> Q:    Can you care to explain?

> A:    Because…at that point…of time, I was feeling lazy to write down the whole thing, **because…before \[the Counsellor\] asked me to write down \[what happened\], \[she\] told me that…she will ask the principal to call the child protection officer to come down to our school. And then…they will bring me---go to the police station to make a report. So, I thought that…since I was really lazy**, **I thought it’s okay to not write \[the Sofa Incident\] down here \[in the Note\] because in the end, I’m still going to like, tell it to the police officer****.**

> …

> Q:    Do you think writing \[about\] an incident \[where it\] is alleged \[that the accused\] violated you, okay, is important?

> A:    I did wrote about some incidents.

> **Q:**      **I’m talking with regards to the \[Sofa Incident\]. Is that incident not important to you?**

> **A:**      **It is**, **but \[the Sofa Incident\] doesn’t…affect me as much as these incidents \[in the Note\]****.**

> …

> Q:    \[H\]ow much \[were\] you affected by the \[Sofa Incident\]?

> A:    Quite affected.

> **Q:**      **\[S\]houldn’t \[the Sofa Incident\] be here \[in the Note\]?**

> **A:**      **But I did told it to the police.**

> **Q:**      **No, shouldn’t \[the Sofa Incident\] be here \[in the Note\]?**

> **A:**      **I just wrote down whatever affects me the most** **.**

> Q:    Is that what the counsellor told you to write, to write what affected you most?

> A:    She told me to write down.

> Q:    Write down, what?

> A:    What happened.

> **Q:**      **So, did \[the Sofa Incident\] happen or not?**

> **A:**      **It did happen.**

> Q:    Why never write \[the Sofa Incident\] down?

> A:    Because I told you, I was lazy.

> …

> Q:    And \[the Note was\] written down after the \[Master Bedroom Incident\], \[the Sofa Incident\] …Why never write \[down these incidents in the Note\]?

> A:    Lazy.

> Q:    \[A\]ccording to your evidence, counsellor have told you to write what happened.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    But you didn’t write down what happened?

> A:    I did write down about the \[Bedroom Incident\].

> Q:    I put it to you that \[the accused\], he didn’t grab and drag you to the bed \[in relation to the Master Bedroom Incident\], you can agree or disagree.

> A:    Disagree.

> **Q:**      **If such an incident happened, you would have written it down in \[the Note\].**

> **A:**      **Like I said before, I knew that…I’ll be telling the same thing to the police** **.**

> **Q:**      **And did you tell the police that \[the accused\] grabbed your hand and dragged you to the bed?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

177    She testified to similar effect when asked to clarify her reference to “lazy”:

> 
| 

Court:

 | 

\[Y\[ou mention\[ed\] several times in your evidence that the reason \[the Note\] does not refer to the \[Master Bedroom Incident\] as well as the \[Sofa Incident\] was because you were lazy.

 |
| 

\[A\]:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

**Now, can you explain to me \[in\] as much detail as possible, what do you mean by “lazy”?**

 |
| 

\[A\]

 | 

**\[B\]ecause…I knew that once I met the counsellor…I would be going to the police station where I would, again, tell---share with them about the incidents that happened.** So…since I was lazy**, I thought that I might just write the \[Bedroom Incident\], and then when I reached \[the\] police station, I would just share everything that happened.**

 |
| 

\[emphasis added in bold\]

 |

  
  

178    The Complainant had then said she knew that she would be going to the police station when she was writing the Note as either the Teacher or the Counsellor had informed her that the Principal would be notified after her counselling session to call in the “child protection team” and that “they” would then bring her to the police station:[\[note: 275\]](#Ftn_275)

> 
| 

Court:

 | 

How did you know when you wrote this \[Note\] that…the next step would be is meeting with the police?

 |
| 

\[A\]:

 | 

Witness: Because…when I met my counsellor, there was someone who told me…that once I met the counsellor then…she would…talk to the principal to…call the child protection team, and then, they will bring me to the police station.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Who was this someone?

 |
| 

\[A\]

 | 

If I’m not wrong, it should be either my teacher or counsellor I don’t remember who told me that.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Was this told to you before or after you had finished writing \[the Note\]?

 |
| 

\[A\]:

 | 

Before.

 |

  
  

179    This was somewhat different from the Complainant’s earlier testimony, where she had attributed her knowledge of having to go to the police station to the Counsellor.[\[note: 276\]](#Ftn_276) But, it was not a material difference that affected her credibility – for she was ultimately consistent on the fact that she already knew, when she was writing the Note, that she would be going to the police station at some point after her counselling session. In any event, given:[^277]

> (a)     the Teacher’s testimony that she did not tell the Complainant that they would be going to the police station after her counselling session; and

> (b)     that the Counsellor had informed the Complainant that she might have to refer her case to a “higher authority” (which she clarified only in court to refer to the Principal),

the Counsellor was very likely the source of, or basis for, the Complainant’s knowledge that she would have to go to the police station at some point after her counselling session. In any event, it would have been reasonable for the Complainant to have assumed, given the gravity of her disclosures to the Teacher and the Counsellor, that she would eventually have to go to the police station to inform the police about all that had happened. Indeed, her statement in the Note that she had “thought about reporting \[the accused’s conduct\] to the police”[\[note: 278\]](#Ftn_278) showed she was already alive to the possibility of police involvement in relation to the accused’s conduct when she was penning the Note.

180     Second, although the Complainant did not pen the Master Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident down in the Note, she testified that she did _tell_ the Counsellor at the counselling session on 13 January 2017 about the Sofa Incident and that there were “three incidents”.[\[note: 279\]](#Ftn_279) The Complainant could not remember if the Counsellor had then asked her why she did not include all three incidents in the Note. While the Counsellor did not testify that the Complainant had told her about the Sofa Incident or that there were “three incidents”, I was mindful of the Counsellor’s testimony that she had refrained from probing the Complainant on whether the accused had “abused” her or massaged her on other occasions (apart from those the Complainant had already stated in the Note) as:[^280]

> (a)     it was a Friday and school had already ended at 12:30pm for all the students when she met the Complainant.

> (b)     she did not want to delay the Complainant as it was already between 1:30pm to 2:00pm when the Complainant finished penning the Note and the Complainant had yet to have her lunch.

> (c)     she did not want her first session with the Complainant to be “too draggy” and thought that this session was already “very long”.

> (d)     she did not want to interrogate the Complainant and frighten her.

> (e)     she wanted to maintain a good rapport with the Complainant.

> (f)     she did not want to continually question the Complainant and make the Complainant feel that she did not trust the Complainant.

> (g)     she did not think it was her duty as a counsellor to find out details.

181    In these circumstances, the mere fact that the Master Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident were not written down in the Note did not necessarily mean that the Complainant had fabricated these incidents.[\[note: 281\]](#Ftn_281)

(B)   Failure to react or seek help not unreasonable

182    The Defence submitted that the Complainant’s failure to seek help created a reasonable doubt within the Prosecution’s case. The Defence contended that the Complainant’s testimony on the Master Bedroom Incident was “incredible” as it “defie\[d\] logic that on \[the\] one hand, she physically resisted the accused by pushing (pulling) herself away but on the other hand, \[she\] did not call out or shout for help even when \[the accused\] overpowered her and forcefully dragged her into the room”.[\[note: 282\]](#Ftn_282) In this regard, the Defence submitted that “the natural reaction of someone when \[she\] is dragged, grabbed or pull\[ed\] would be to resist and shout especially if unsuccessful \[when resisting\]”. Yet, the Complainant had “somehow allowed herself to be abused the very next moment” when she “ceased all resistance” to “lay down on the bed and \[spread\] her legs as instructed” “and simply allowed the alleged incident to take place”. The Defence added that the Helper and Stepbrother were “just steps away” and “would have interfered in some way if \[the Complainant\] had called out”.[^283]

183    These submissions were unpersuasive. As with the Defence’s submissions in relation to the Bedroom Incident, they were based on the misconception that victims of sexual offences should behave in a certain manner. But the Complainant had explained that she did not shout for help when the accused dragged/pulled her into the master bedroom because she was scared. She had also explained that she did not shout for help while the accused was molesting her because she was “scared” he would do something worse to her (such as to rape her) if she did.[\[note: 284\]](#Ftn_284)

184    I was also mindful that, at the time of the Master Bedroom Incident:

> (a)     the Complainant was only a 13-year-old girl: and

> (b)     the accused, who was larger than her, had just suddenly, forcefully, and brazenly dragged/pulled her into the confines of his bedroom (where she was then alone with him with the door only slightly open).

185    In these circumstances, I did not think that the Complainant’s failure to shout for help was at all irrational.[\[note: 285\]](#Ftn_285) I was also mindful of her testimony that she had hesitated to call out to the Helper in the few seconds she had to think while the accused was dragging/pulling her into the bedroom because:[^286]

> (a)     the Helper was scared of the accused; and

> (b)     she thought that the Helper might think it was nothing serious and not run towards her.

186    I set out the Complainant’s testimony on this aspect:

> Q:    See, when you resist, which means…you’re fighting back?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    An adult is in the house?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    In the form of \[the Helper\]?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    If you shouted, what do you think would have happen\[ed\]?

> A:    My first thought was that \[the Helper\] will come, and she would r\[u\]n and come to me but then I had second thoughts about her running also, running towards me.

> **Q:**      **Why is that so?**

> **A:**      **Because \[the Helper\] is also scared of my mum and \[the accused\], so I hesitate\[d\] to shout because I also had another thought that she might not run towards me because she might…\[think\] that it’s nothing serious.**

> **Q:**      **\[H\]ow long was \[the accused\] grabbing you and pulling you?**

> **A:**      **For a few seconds.**

> **Q:**      **So in that few seconds, you thought of shouting?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And you also thought of not shouting?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **All these thoughts were coming to your mind at that moment, in that…few seconds.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

187    The Defence’s submission that the Stepbrother would have “interfered in some way” if the Complainant had called out for help was also incredible. He was, at most, only four years old at this time and it was questionable if he could have “interfered” in any meaningful way.

##### (3)   Complainant was consistent on Sofa Incident

188    Key aspects of the Complainant’s testimony on the Sofa Incident appear above. Her testimony on the accused’s offending conduct during this incident was materially consistent. This included her testimony on how he had first pulled the neckline of her T-shirt down before he then pulled the neckline up and tilted his head to look inside her T-shirt. Her testimony was also unembellished. When asked if she knew what he was looking at when he looked inside her T-shirt, she only said that she _thought_ he was looking at her breast. She did not go further to say that she knew he was indeed looking at her breast(s).[\[note: 287\]](#Ftn_287)

189    It was common ground between the parties that:[\[note: 288\]](#Ftn_288)

> (a)     the accused had disciplined the Complainant over a necklace in their respective versions of the Sofa Incident (but it was disputed if she was indeed wearing a necklace during this incident); and

> (b)     this day on which the accused had disciplined the Complainant over a necklace was also the first, and only, occasion he had ever disciplined, or scolded, the Complainant on any issue.

190    The Defence also accepted the Complainant’s testimony that the day of this incident was the first time she and the accused had sat like that on the sofa to talk.[\[note: 289\]](#Ftn_289)

191    But what was the link between the Sofa Incident and the Lunchbox Incident (that happened on 10 January 2017)? The Complainant said that the Sofa Incident had happened sometime in 2016, after the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident.[\[note: 290\]](#Ftn_290) But, the Defence asserted that its version of the Sofa Incident _and_ the Lunchbox Incident had _both_ happened on 10 January 2017. In particular, the accused and the Mother both testified that the accused had disciplined the Complainant over the Lunchbox Incident (which happened on the morning of 10 January 2017) on the evening of 10 January 2017 when the Complainant and the accused were seated on the sofa. Because this incident on the sofa was intertwined with the accused having disciplined the Complainant over a necklace, it was therefore the Defence’s case that the accused had disciplined the Complainant over the Lunchbox Incident _and_ a necklace on the evening of 10 January 2017 while they were seated on the sofa.

192    The answer to this question was critical. If the Sofa Incident happened in 2016, the accused (and the Mother) could not have disciplined the Complainant over the Lunchbox Incident on that _same_ day. This was because the Lunchbox Incident happened only on 10 January 2017.[\[note: 291\]](#Ftn_291) It would also cut through the “core” of the Defence’s case theory of a supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017, which allegedly led the Complainant to falsely implicate the accused.[^292] This was because the bedrock of this supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017 was that the accused had:

> (a)     disciplined the Complainant for the first, and only, occasion on the evening of 10 January 2017 (the date of the Lunchbox Incident); _and_

> (b)     disciplined the Complainant over the Lunchbox Incident _and_ a necklace while seated with her on the sofa.

193    But, if the Sofa Incident (which was intertwined with the accused having disciplined the Complainant over a necklace) happened on a day in 2016, then _this_ day in 2016 would have been that first, and only, occasion on which the accused had disciplined the Complainant. He could not have then disciplined her, again, on the evening of 10 January 2017 over the Lunchbox Incident because this would then have amounted to a _second_ instance of him disciplining her – which was inconsistent with the common ground between the parties (and the Defence’s case theory) that the day on which he had disciplined her over a necklace was also the first, and only, occasion he had ever disciplined her on any issue.

194    This supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017, which allegedly led the Complainant to falsely implicate the accused, was detailed by the Defence in the following terms in its closing submissions:

> 38.     **The Defence\[’s\] case theory is that a triggering incident happened on 10 January 2017 which led to \[the Complainant\] making the false accusations against \[the accused\] which form the subject matter of the charges.**

> …

> 41.    \[T\]he core of \[the Defence’s\] case theory…is the **“triggering incident” on 10 January 2017**. The facts of the “triggering incident” are as follows:

>> a.    On the morning of 10 January 2017, \[the Mother\] sent a text message to \[the Complainant\] questioning her over a packed lunch that \[she had\] left at the riser outside \[the Flat\].[\[note: 293\]](#Ftn_293) \[The Mother\] expressed her frustration and disappointment with \[her\] on the issue of leaving the packed lunch at the riser \[_viz_, the Lunchbox Incident\].

>> b.    Immediately, following the confrontation \[with the Complainant\], \[the Mother\] texted \[the Father\] to confront him over the \[Lunchbox Incident\] and this led to a heated argument leaving \[the Mother\] even more frustrated and feeling hopeless that \[the Father\] was neither supportive nor understanding of her parenting needs for \[the Complainant\][^294].

>> c.    After the said confrontations with \[the Complainant and her Father\], totally distraught, \[the Mother\] texted \[the accused\]. Amongst other things, \[the Mother\] told \[the accused\] that “_I am so upset till I cannot work now…I have seriously given up with him, with her, with life_” and asked \[the accused\] “_How can I continue with this fight alone?_” In response, \[the accused\] said, “_Let me intervene K. I will speak to her…Don’t worry. I will help you from now. Realign her back..._”.[^295]

>> **d**.     **Accordingly, for the 1st time ever, \[the accused\] disciplined \[the Complainant\] on the evening of 10 January 2017 over the \[Lunchbox Incident\]. During the conversation, \[the accused\] noticed that \[the Complainant\] was wearing the white gold necklace gifted by her \[Father\], pulled her t-shirt just enough to expose it and told her to remove it.** According to \[the Mother\], \[the accused\] seems to have mentioned that he was not afraid of \[the Complainant’s Father\].

>> e.    \[The accused\] observed that \[the Complainant’s\] demeanour changed and turned to one of anger and rebellion after she was told to remove the necklace. This is most probably due to the fact that in the past, \[the accused\] always took the role of a comforter and mentor whenever \[the Mother\] disciplined \[the Complainant\] and never as a disciplinarian. To \[the Complainant\], \[the accused\] was her ally and was supposed to be on her side, not \[the Mother’s\]. Further or alternatively, \[the Complainant’s\] anger may be due to the fact that \[the accused\] was seen to be asserting dominance over her and/or expressed no fear \[of the Complainant’s Father\].

>> f.    At the point in time when \[the accused\] addressed the necklace issue, \[the Mother\] was seated across \[the living room\] at the dining area facing both \[the accused and the Complainant\] who were seated in the living area and she was able to observe the exchange between them.[^296].

>> g.    After \[the accused\] finished speaking to \[the Complainant\], \[the Mother\] asked to speak to \[her\]. When \[the Mother\] spoke to \[the Complainant\] about the \[Lunchbox Incident\] and the necklace, she also observed \[the Complainant’s\] unusually angry, rebellious and/or unremorseful stance.

>> h.    This angry stance again upset \[the Mother\] and led to \[the Mother\] threatening to send \[the Complainant\] away to a girl’s home also for the very 1st time. This caused \[the Complainant\] to break down and cry.

>> **i**.     **Accordingly, following this “triggering incident”, the Complainant was angry and displeased with \[the accused\] for the following reasons:**

>>> **i**.     **For stepping in for and on behalf of \[the Mother\] and disciplining her for the 1st time over the \[Lunchbox Incident\] first**; and then

>>> **ii**.     **For telling her to remove the necklace.**

>>> iii.   For saying that he is not afraid of her \[Father\].

>>> iv.    For turning into \[the Mother’s\] ally against her.

>> j.    This anger and displeasure were further compounded by \[the Mother\] also telling \[the Complainant\] that she will be sent to the girl’s home if she continued to misbehave. It is also probable that \[the Complainant\] was also angry and displeased with \[the Mother\].

>> k.    As such, the very next day, on 11 January 2017, at a random unplanned one-on-one CCE session with \[the Teacher\], \[the Complainant\] made use of the opportunity to make a single allegation of outraging modesty against \[the accused\] in order to “teach” \[the accused\] a lesson and/or simply to escape from living with \[the Mother and the accused\] and instead return to living with her \[Father\] who dotes on her and gives her total freedom.

>> l.    On 13 January 2017, \[the Complainant\] repeated the outrage of modesty allegation to \[the Counsellor\] and on 18 January 2017, \[the Report\] was lodged…

> 42.     **It is the Defence’s submission that \[the Complainant’s\]** **single** **outrage of modesty allegation was made right after the triggering incident on 10 January 2017** \[and\] was most likely motivated by \[the Complainant’s\] anger and/or the urgent desire to get away from \[the Mother and the accused\] and instead live with her \[Father\].

> …

> 148.  This leads the Defence to **submit that \[the Complainant\], who was thoroughly unhappy about the confrontation and/or threats made to her by both \[the Mother\] and \[the accused\] on 10 January 2017, to make use of the** **unplanned** **CCE session with \[her Teacher\] as an opportunity to falsely implicate \[the accused\] with the ultimate goal of returning to her \[Father\] who is her ticket to freedom and good life.**

> ...

> 238.  …The Defence’s position is that \[the Sofa Incident\], where \[the accused\] disciplined \[the Complainant\] was the trigger that led to \[the Complainant\] making all the allegations against \[the accused\].

> …

> 276.  The competing interests of \[the Mother\], \[the Complainant\] and the \[Father\] all culminated into a huge confrontation on 10 January 2017 over the \[Lunchbox Incident\] …Following this ugly confrontation, \[the accused\] stepped in to help \[the Mother\] **only to find himself becoming the target of baseless accusations by \[the Complainant\] who grasped the opportunity to turn things around for herself**.

> 277.  …one cannot but believe that **\[the accused\] has become the scapegoat in this sad broken family saga**.

> …

> 286.  …when asked why \[the Complainant\] had cast such allegations against \[the accused\], **\[the Mother’s\] theory was that \[on 10 January 2017\], \[the Complainant\] was angry with both \[the Mother\] and \[the accused\] and also very afraid and did this to get her way out**…

> …

> 292.  …The Defence stands by its case theory that \[the Sofa Incident\] was the triggering incident that cause \[the Complainant\] to make such untruthful allegations against \[the accused\].

> …

> 302.  …

>> c.     **\[The Complainant’s\] allegations of outrage and insult of modesty are clearly an afterthought set in motion by \[the\] “triggering” incident on 10 January 2017.**

>> …

>> l.    In all likelihood, Defence believes that **\[the Complainant\] cast these baseless allegations mainly with the desperate intent of getting away from \[the Mother’s\] and \[the accused’s\] control**.

195    The Defence did put it to the Complainant that she was lying.[\[note: 297\]](#Ftn_297) But, _nothing_ was put to her as to why she was lying and falsely implicating the accused. Indeed, _none_ of the allegations relating to the Complainant’s purported motives to falsely implicate the accused, which appeared in the Defence’s closing submissions, were ever put to the Complainant.[^298] Neither did the accused testify on any such motives during his examination-in-chief. In fact, when asked in examination-in-chief as to why he thought the Complainant had implicated him in relation to the Master Bedroom Incident, he responded that he did not know.[^299] In a similar vein, when asked in examination-in-chief if he knew why the Complainant had accused him of looking inside her T-shirt during the Sofa Incident, he said he had “no idea”.[^300] He even testified in examination-in-chief that he did not know why the Complainant had made the Report against him:[^301]

> Q:    Okay. After the 10th \[of January 2017\], \[the Complainant\] has given evidence that she \[had\] informed her \[Teacher\] that she was molested and she also inform\[ed\] the Court that she was referred to \[the Counsellor\] whom she…informed that she was molested and subsequently on 18th January 2017, \[the Complainant\] made a police report. Why do you think she made a police report against you?

> A:    I don’t know.

196    The accused also struggled (and visibly so as well), in cross-examination, to explain why the Complainant would want to falsely implicate him. He similarly struggled to explain why no motive to falsely implicate him was ever put to her:[\[note: 302\]](#Ftn_302)

> Q:    So…according to you, all of \[the Complainant’s\] evidence in relation to these 3 offences are all untrue, isn’t it?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **And your evidence is that you don’t know why she has done this to you, am I right?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, in your mind, \[the Complainant\] is fabricating allegations against you for reasons that you are unsure of?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> …

> Q:    The reason why you are unaware of any motives that \[the Complainant\] might have to frame you…is because…\[s\]he has no motive to frame you, and I put it to you. You can agree or disagree.

> A:    Disagree.

> Q:    And so, when you disagree with me, it means and I confirm with you, that you think that she might have a motive to frame you.

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **But you do not know what that motive is?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> …

> Q:    And when your lawyer was cross-examining \[the Complainant\], she wasn’t asked why she was lying and making up evidence against you, am I right?

> A:    I can’t recall.

> …

> Q:    And if it is possible that she could have done this \[_viz_, lying and making up evidence\], you would have just asked her while she was on the stand, wouldn’t you?

> A:    I didn’t know I can.

> **Q:**      **After all these years, 2016, until now, we are in July 2019, you must have wondered why, why is \[the Complainant\] doing this, am I right?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And now that she has come to Court to tell her story, you didn’t ask her why she was lying, am I right?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> …

> Q:    And I put it to you, that you didn’t ask her this question, because you knew that she had no motive to lie.

> A:    She knew---she has motive.

> **Q:**      **So, your position is that she has a motive but you are unaware \[of what this motive is\]?**

> **A:**      **I don’t know what.**

> **Q:**      **And not knowing what, you still did not ask her on the stand?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

197    The accused’s inability to explain why the Complainant would falsely implicate him was even more glaring when he was given a golden opportunity to clarify his position on her alleged motives. This was in light of certain sentences in his statements, where he appeared to suggest that she had falsely implicated him as she was “unhappy” staying with him and the Mother and wanted to return to her Father. The relevant sentences in these statements read as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="40.04%"><col width="59.96%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Accused’s statements</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Extract</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">First statement, recorded on 18 January 2017 (Exhibit D8)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“…If [the Complainant] is unhappy staying with us, I am willing to discuss with my wife about this and return her to her father.

I think she just does not want to stay with us. I have always treated her like my own daughter.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

198    But he explained that these statements merely meant that he was “more than happy to oblige” the Complainant if she did not want to stay with him and the Mother. When then asked point-blank if he was alleging that she had fabricated the Three Incidents to return to her Father, he simply said, “I don’t know”. When pressed further, he was only prepared to go so far as to say that it was “possible”, based on his “assumption”, that she had fabricated the Three Incidents to return to her Father.[\[note: 303\]](#Ftn_303) His entirely non-committal responses are set out below:[^304]

> **Q:**      **And so, if you refer with me to D8, this is your 1st statement. The 2nd last paragraph…the 2nd last line, “If \[the Complainant\] is unhappy staying with us, I am willing to discuss with my wife about this and return her to her father. She does not have to do this to me.” What do you mean by this line?**

> **A:**      **Um, what I meant was, if there’s any issues, probably like she have issues at home, she doesn’t want to stay with us anymore, want to reverse the custody, we are---I am more than happy to oblige her.**

> Q:    But…you don’t know for a fact that \[the Complainant\] has made these allegations against you for the purpose of moving out of your house?

> A:    No.

> **Q:**      **If you flip with me to the exhibit marked as D9, paragraph 14, “I think there is so much misunderstanding between \[the Complainant\] and me. She mistook my intentions for the wrong reasons. I think she just does not want to stay with us. I have always treated her like my own daughter.” So similarly, what do you mean when you say, “I think she just does not want to stay with us”?**

> **A:**      **For the same reason.**

> **Q:**      **But again, you are not alleging that \[the Complainant\] has fabricated these incidents against you for the purpose of going back to her \[Father’s\] home?**

> **A:**      **I don’t know.**

> Q:    \[T\]hat is not your allegation, am I right? It is not your evidence that she is doing this for this purpose?

> A:    (pause – 00:00:07) Can you rephrase?

> **Q:**      **Your position in Court is that \[the Complainant\] is not doing this so that she can go back, or by doing this, I mean fabricating evidence against you for the purpose of moving back to her \[Father’s\] home?**

> **A:**      **It is possible.**

> Q:    \[B\]ut you do not know this for a fact, am I right?

> **A:**      **Just my assumption.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

199    Indeed, the accused’s wholly non-committal stance on the Complainant’s alleged motives to falsely implicate him stood in marked contrast to the Mother’s testimony. Unlike the accused, the Mother had testified less than five minutes into her examination-in-chief that she believed the Complainant had lied about the accused molesting her because the Complainant was “angry” with her and the accused for scolding her over “an incident” on the “10th of January 2010 (_sic_)”.[\[note: 305\]](#Ftn_305)

200    In any event, the Mother’s testimony was inconsistent with the case theory that was initially advanced by the Defence during the Mother’s examination-in-chief (as opposed to the accused’s examination-in-chief). This had happened when the Defence sought to rely on certain WhatsApp exchanges between the Mother and the Father. The Prosecution contested the relevance of these exchanges, and I asked the Defence to clarify its case theory to understand their relevance. Counsel explained that it was _not_ the Defence’s case that the Father had instigated the Complainant to frame the accused. Instead, Counsel explained the relevance of these WhatsApp exchanges in the following completely tentative terms:[\[note: 306\]](#Ftn_306)

> We are trying to let the Court know...the family dynamics and what this poor girl is actually going through. **There’s a lot of stresses in her life and** **_perhaps_** **these were the reasons why certain things were interpreted by her in the way she did**.

> \[emphasis added in bold and in italics\]

201    Unlike the Mother’s testimony[\[note: 307\]](#Ftn_307), it was therefore _not_ the Defence’s case, at this point, that the Complainant had lied about the Three Incidents to frame the accused. Rather, its case was that the Complainant had somehow misinterpreted “certain things” as there were “a lot of stresses in her life” arising from her “family dynamics”. As the Defence’s case theory remained unclear, I stood the matter down for it to clarify its instructions. I had great difficulty understanding how misinterpretations on the Complainant’s part could have led to her allegations. How could she have misinterpreted the accused’s supposedly innocuous _back_ massage in her bedroom to include him groping her _breast_ as well? How could she have misinterpreted his supposed act of pulling down the neckline of her T-shirt slightly to claim that he had also tilted his head to look inside her T-shirt? And, how could she have misinterpreted events that supposedly never even happened in the master bedroom to allege that they did in fact happen? When proceedings resumed, the Defence _revised_ its case theory:[^308]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="25%"><col width="37.5%"><col width="37.5%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Incident</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Revised case theory</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Initial case theory</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Bedroom Incident</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Complainant had misconstrued what had happened.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Complainant had misinterpreted/misconstrued what had happened.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Master Bedroom Incident</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Complainant had <u>fabricated</u> her allegations.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sofa Incident</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Complainant had misconstrued what had happened OR <u>fabricated</u> her allegations.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

202    Counsel then stated that the WhatsApp exchanges would:[\[note: 309\]](#Ftn_309)

> …show the acrimony…between the \[Mother and Father\], the different parenting styles, the issues that \[the Complainant\] was actually having with the skipping of CCA and religious classes. And the \[Father’s\] views as opposed to the \[Mother’s\] view, and the stresses that \[the Complainant\] was going through…

203    The Defence’s case theory therefore now included assertions that the Complainant had fabricated the Master Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident. Counsel acknowledged the distinction between a “fabrication” and a “misconstruction” in her reply submissions.[\[note: 310\]](#Ftn_310) However, she sought to downplay this distinction by claiming that she had been “unsure” about whether to use the term “fabrication” or “misconstruction” in relation to the Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident as the accused’s positions on these incidents were not “bare denials”. The logic of this argument was not entirely clear. It was apparent to me during the proceedings that Counsel _was_ aware that the term “fabrication” would apply in a case where an event had never happened. This was in light of her statement that the Master Bedroom Incident “must be a fabrication because it never happened”.[^311] On this note, it had been the accused’s position that he had:

> (a)     in relation to the Bedroom Incident, _never_ used his leg to caress the Complainant’s calves or slid his hand into her T-shirt to stroke her tummy and then used that hand to grope her right breast from outside her bra.

> (b)     in relation to the Sofa Incident, _never_ pulled the neckline of the Complainant’s T-shirt up and tilted his head to look inside her T-shirt.

204    Like the Master Bedroom Incident, the accused’s position was therefore that these events had never happened during the Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident. It was therefore unclear why Counsel did not take the position that these events were also fabricated. Even if I accepted that Counsel had somehow been “unsure” as to whether to use the term “fabrication” or “misconstruction” in relation to the Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident, this only revealed that the Defence was confused about its own case theory.

205    Counsel also tried to downplay the distinction between a “fabrication” and a “misconstruction” by reasoning that both would have nevertheless led to the Complainant making an allegation that was false. This was correct, but it ignored the _different_ motivations underpinning a “fabrication” (or a lie) and a “misconstruction” – which the Prosecution explained in the following terms:[\[note: 312\]](#Ftn_312)

> 132    ...A “misconstruction” or “misinterpretation” suggests that \[the Complainant\] was acting in good faith in making her claims against the accused, albeit incorrectly \[or mistakenly\]. However, during \[the Complainant’s\] cross-examination, it was put to her that she was lying…in relation to all \[the Three Incidents\], naturally presupposing that she was acting _mala fides_.

206    Indeed, even Counsel appreciated this distinction between a “fabrication” (which suggests acting in bad faith) and a “misconstruction” (which suggests acting mistakenly but nevertheless in good faith). This was evident in her explanation as to why the Defence had purportedly relied on the “alternative” of “misconstruction”, instead of “fabrication”, in its case theory:[\[note: 313\]](#Ftn_313)

> 96    In fact, the Court and the Prosecution will recognise that it would be much easier for the Defence to go along with “fabrication”. However, the Defence has decided to go with an alternative \[of “misconstruction”\] as well in a bid to save the currently strained familial relations which we hope will mend with time!

207    If anything, Counsel’s explanation showed that she was _already_ aware of the distinction between a “fabrication” and a “misconstruction” when she advanced these two versions of the Defence’s case theory during the trial. In any event, this explanation also made little sense – for the Defence’s position on the Master Bedroom Incident was that it was a “fabrication”.

208    These two versions of the Defence’s case theory, advanced over the course of less than 30 minutes and after the accused had already testified, showed the confusion in the Defence’s case. In any event, both of these belated versions were very different from that which was eventually advanced by the Defence in its closing submissions.[\[note: 314\]](#Ftn_314) This final version was to the effect that the Complainant had fabricated the Three Incidents to frame the accused because:

> (a)     she wanted to “teach” him “a lesson” as she was “angry and displeased” with him for:

>> (i)       “stepping in for and on behalf of \[the Mother\] and disciplining her for the \[first\] time over the \[Lunchbox Incident\]”;

>> (ii)       “telling her to remove the necklace”;

>> (iii)       “saying that he \[was\] not afraid of her \[Father\]”; and

>> (iv)       “turning into \[the Mother’s\] ally against her”.

> (b)     the Mother’s “threat to send \[her\] away to a girls’ home \[was\] the straw that broke \[her\] back and made her desperate to get away from \[the Mother and the accused\]”.

> (c)     she wanted to “escape from living with \[the Mother\] and \[the accused\] and \[to\] return to living with her \[Father\] who dotes on her and gives her total freedom”.

> (d)     she was angry with the Mother and the accused and “also very afraid” and wanted to “get her way out” or “turn things around for herself”.

209    Indeed, much of this third and final version of the Defence’s case theory was based on the Mother’s testimony at the tail end of her examination-in-chief.[\[note: 315\]](#Ftn_315) But, all of this had come only _after_ the Complainant and the accused had finished testifying. This Mother’s testimony (the genesis of this third version of the Defence’s case theory) was hence never put to the Complainant – and she was thus never given the chance to respond to it. But, this final version of the Defence’s case theory (which appeared only in its submissions) was of such importance that it _should_ have been put to the Complainant to give her the chance to respond to it before it could be relied on to mount a submission that she lacked credit (_Browne v Dunn_[^316]). In any event, this version of the Defence’s case theory was also inconsistent with the accused’s own testimony – which was that he did _not_ know why the Complainant was supposedly falsely implicating him.[^317]

210    All three versions of the Defence’s case theory also did not explain why the Complainant had to make up _three_ incidents against the accused – when a false allegation, in relation to any _one_ incident, would have sufficed for her to achieve the purposes alleged in the Defence’s closing submissions.[\[note: 318\]](#Ftn_318) In any event, if this was truly a case where the Complainant had wanted to falsely implicate the accused to achieve these alleged purposes, she would have fabricated allegations of at least similar, if not increasing, gravity. Yet, the Sofa Incident, the last incident which she purportedly fabricated to falsely implicate the accused, was far less serious than the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident. The Defence’s allegation that the Complainant had wanted to falsely implicate the accused was also contradicted by the following aspects which were not challenged by the Defence:[^319]

> (a)     That the Complainant had only initially asked her Stepmother about the meaning of “molest”, and had not directly implicated the accused, or provided details of what the accused had allegedly done to her, on this occasion. Indeed, it was not disputed that the Complainant never revealed to her Stepmother any details about what the accused had allegedly done to her.[\[note: 320\]](#Ftn_320) Had the Complainant wanted to falsely implicate the accused, it was difficult to understand why she did not do so on this occasion.

> (b)     That the Complainant had hesitated when her Stepmother advised her to report the matter to the police (as she wanted to first get close to the Mother so that the Mother would believe her).[\[note: 321\]](#Ftn_321)

> (c)     That the Complainant had adopted a position of stoic passivity for almost a week, from 11 January 2017 (the date of her disclosure to her Teacher) to 18 January 2017 (the date the Report was lodged) and had to be brought by the CPOs to the NPC to lodge the Report. Had the Complainant wanted to falsely implicate the accused, she would have taken active steps to lodge such a report.

211    It was for the Defence to _first_ establish _sufficient_ evidence of a motive on the Complainant’s part to falsely implicate the accused (_GCK_ at \[102\]), to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. And, it is _only_ when a reasonable doubt is raised in the Prosecution’s case that the burden of proof will shift to the Prosecution to prove that there was no such motive (_Goh Han Heng v PP_[\[note: 322\]](#Ftn_322)). The Defence cannot therefore merely allege that the Complainant had a motive to falsely implicate the accused. To my mind, _no_ sufficient evidence of a motive on the Complainant’s part to falsely implicate the accused was raised in this case.

212    That said, the Complainant’s testimony on whether the Sofa Incident and the Lunchbox Incident was linked still merited discussion. This was because:

> (a)     the Prosecution’s primary case theory was that the Sofa Incident (which was intertwined with the accused disciplining the Complainant over a necklace) took place sometime in 2016; and

> (b)     the absence of a motive on the part of the Complainant to falsely implicate the accused was insufficient, on its own, to render her testimony unusually convincing and correspondingly sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

213    I therefore now review the Complainant’s testimony on when the Sofa Incident took place. This incident was _inextricably_ linked to when the accused had disciplined the Complainant over a necklace (as it was common ground between the parties that the accused had been disciplining the Complainant over a necklace at the time of this incident). The Complainant’s testimony on the Lunchbox Incident also merited review, given the Defence’s position that the Lunchbox Incident _and_ the Sofa Incident had _both_ happened on 10 January 2017.

(A)   Only Mother queried about lunchbox found at Duct

214    The Lunchbox Incident was only revealed during the Defence’s cross-examination of the Complainant. Indeed, it was the Complainant who _first_ volunteered the facts underlying the Lunchbox Incident without any prompting by the Defence. She had, in cross-examination, _readily_ admitted that the Mother would scold her whenever she failed to perform her evening prayers; when she lied; when she occupied the bathroom for a long time; when she finished her soap very quickly; and when she did not finish her lunch or dinner.[\[note: 323\]](#Ftn_323) This led the Defence to ask her how the Mother knew that she had not finished her lunch. She then _readily_ explained that there was “one time” when she “didn’t bring \[her\] lunch\[box\] to school \[and had\] put it outside the \[Flat\]” where it was found. This was necessarily a reference to the Lunchbox Incident (as it was not either party’s position that the Complainant’s lunchbox had been found outside the Flat on other occasions as well). If the Lunchbox Incident had been that fateful “triggering incident” (or part of a “triggering incident”) which apparently led the Complainant to falsely implicate the accused because she was purportedly ““angry and displeased”, the _unhesitating_ manner in which she volunteered information about this incident suggested otherwise.

215    Following the Complainant’s testimony on the “one time” her lunchbox had been found outside the Flat, the Defence showed the Complainant an _undated_ photograph of the Duct[\[note: 324\]](#Ftn_324) and asked her to state what it showed. She _readily_ replied that it showed “the lunchbox”. But she could not remember _when_ she had left this lunchbox at the Duct. She guessed she had done so sometime in 2016, but _candidly_ accepted that she might be wrong in her recollection.[^325] However, she recalled that the Mother had asked her why she had left her lunchbox at the Duct on the very day she had left it at the Duct. She said that the Mother had first sent her a photograph of the lunchbox at the Duct over WhatsApp before proceeding to ask her about it over WhatsApp. She added that the Mother had also spoken to her in person about the lunchbox when she returned to the Flat from school later that same day. She said she remembered “only” the Mother speaking to her about the lunchbox when she returned to the Flat. She also said that she did not recall the accused also speaking to her about the lunchbox on that day (or on any other day).[^326]

216    As such, even though the Complainant thought that the Lunchbox Incident had happened sometime in 2016, her testimony was that:

> (a)     only the Mother had asked her about the lunchbox.

> (b)     the Mother had spoken to her about the lunchbox on the very day she had left it at the Duct.

> (c)     she did not recall the accused also speaking to her about the lunchbox on the day she had left it at the Duct (or on any other day).

217    The Defence then informed the Complainant that she had left the lunchbox, seen in the undated photograph[\[note: 327\]](#Ftn_327), at the Duct on 10 January 2017. The Complainant was unable to confirm this date as she could not recall having to bring a lunchbox to school in 2017. She only recalled having to do so in 2015 or 2016. That said, she _again_ confirmed that:[^328]

> (a)     only the Mother had asked her about the lunchbox.

> (b)     the Mother had spoken to her about the lunchbox on the very day she had left it at the Duct.

> (c)     she did not recall the accused also speaking to her about the lunchbox on the day she had left it at the Duct (or on any other day).

(B)   No link between Sofa Incident & Lunchbox Incident

218    The Defence later asked the Complainant if she knew of the accused’s “3rd charge”. She replied in the affirmative and stated that this “3rd charge” was the “one where \[they were\] in the living room” (_viz_, the Sofa Incident). She was then asked if she agreed that the “conversation” between the accused and her in relation to the Sofa Incident had started because she had left her lunchbox at the Duct earlier that same day. The Defence’s question was premised on the Lunchbox Incident _and_ the Sofa Incident having happened on the same day. The Complainant replied that she did not remember (the “conversation” between the accused and her in relation to the Sofa Incident having started because she had left her lunchbox at the Duct earlier that same day). It was therefore her position that she did not remember the Lunchbox Incident _and_ the Sofa Incident happening on the same day.[\[note: 329\]](#Ftn_329)

219    According to the Complainant, she was “not sure” how the accused’s “conversation” with her had started in relation to the Sofa Incident. She only recalled him “suddenly talk\[ing\] about \[her\] wearing a necklace” and that she “shouldn’t…show off too much”. At this point, the Defence showed the Complainant her WhatsApp exchange with the Mother on 10 January 2017.[\[note: 330\]](#Ftn_330) This exchange included the _same_ photograph of the Duct which the Defence had earlier showed her (but which was undated).[^331] On seeing the date of this exchange, the Complainant _readily_ accepted that she had left her lunchbox at the Duct on 10 January 2017 (_viz_, the Lunchbox Incident). She also confirmed that the Mother had questioned her about her lunchbox that same day. But she said she did not remember the accused also raising the Lunchbox Incident with her on the evening of 10 January 2017. Indeed, and after having accepted that the Lunchbox Incident had happened on 10 January 2017, she disagreed with the Defence’s assertion (which was premised on the Sofa Incident _and_ the Lunchbox Incident happening on 10 January 2017) that the accused had “enquired on” the Lunchbox Incident during the Sofa Incident (during which he had brought up her necklace):[^332]

> Q:    Okay. I’m instructed that the accused was discussing about this packet of food \[_viz_, the Lunchbox Incident\] on the same day evening with you on 10 January 2017.

> A:    I don’t remember.

> **Q:**      **Okay. And it \[was\] during \[this\] conversation about this packet of food \[** **_viz_** **, the Lunchbox Incident\] where he \[also\] enquired on you wearing the white-gold necklace \[** **_viz_** **, the Sofa Incident\]. This is what I’m instructed.**

> A:    Mmm.

> Q:    You can choose to agree or disagree. You agree or disagree?

> **A:**      **Disagree.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

220    The Complainant therefore effectively disagreed with the Defence that the Sofa Incident _and_ the Lunchbox Incident both happened on 10 January 2017 (the date of the Lunchbox Incident). In other words, she disagreed with the Defence that the Sofa Incident happened on 10 January 2017 (as it was not disputed that the Lunchbox Incident had happened on 10 January 2017).

221    The Complainant repeated her disagreement in this regard when the Defence later put it to her that the Sofa Incident (during which the accused had brought up her necklace) _and_ the Lunchbox Incident (which happened on 10 January 2017) both happened on 10 January 2017:[\[note: 333\]](#Ftn_333)

> Q:    Okay, I put it to you that on 10th January 2017, you left a packet of food in the electric riser \[_viz_, the Lunchbox Incident\] when you went to school.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And \[in\] the evening \[of 10 January 2017\], the accused wanted to discipline you regarding leaving the packet of food \[_viz_, the Lunchbox Incident\]. You can agree or disagree, can’t remember also, no problem.

> A:    Can’t remember.

> **Q:**      **And…the main conversation \[between the accused and you on 10 January 2017 was\] regarding the leaving of your packet of food \[** **_viz_** **, the Lunchbox Incident\]. \[He was\] also disciplin\[ing\] you \[for\] wearing the white-gold necklace \[** **_viz_** **, the Sofa Incident\]. Agree or disagree?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

222    She reiterated her disagreement when the Defence then suggested that she could have forgotten that the Sofa Incident (during which the accused had brought up her necklace) _and_ the Lunchbox Incident (that happened on 10 January 2017) had happened on 10 January 2017 as she was “not very good at recalling”:[\[note: 334\]](#Ftn_334)

Q:

Okay, Witness, in your evidence yesterday, you said \[the accused\] rarely speaks to you, yes?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |

Q:

 | 

And you remember that \[the accused\] spoke to you regarding the necklace issue \[during the Sofa Incident\]?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

Can I say this, \[this is\] the only time you recall \[the accused\] spoke to you about an issue instead of your mother?

 |

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |

Q:

 | 

So, over these 2 year\[\] period, when you’re staying \[in the Flat\] from December 2014 until the day you made \[the Report\], only once \[the accused\] spoke with you.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

**Q:**

 | 

**So, when you say \[the accused\] spoke about the necklace \[during the Sofa Incident\]…I am instructed that \[the accused\] also spoke to you about the food packet \[** **_viz_** **, the Lunchbox Incident\]. Will you accept this?**

 |
| 

**A:**

 | 

**No.**

 |

**Q:**

 | 

**And since you are not very good at recalling…will you agree\[\] that 10th January 2017 is the date \[when\] the accused spoke to you?**

**Q:**

 | 

**That is your position?**

 |
| 

**A:**

 | 

**Yah.**

 | 

**No.**

223    The foregoing review of the Complainant’s testimony revealed that it was _always_ the Complainant’s position that:

> (a)     only the accused had spoken to her about her necklace on the day of the Sofa Incident.

> (b)     the Mother did not speak to her about her necklace on the day of the Sofa Incident.

> (c)     only the Mother had spoken to her about the Lunchbox Incident on the day of the Lunchbox Incident (on 10 January 2017).

> (d)     the accused did not speak to her about the Lunchbox Incident on the day of the Lunchbox Incident (on 10 January 2017).

224    This therefore meant that the day of the Sofa Incident (during which the accused had disciplined the Complainant over a necklace) was _different_ from the day of the Lunchbox Incident (which happened on 10 January 2017). It also meant that the Sofa Incident took place on a day _before_ the Lunchbox Incident happened on 10 January 2017 (as it was neither party’s case that the Sofa Incident had happened _after_ the Lunchbox Incident on 10 January 2017). This, in turn, meant that the accused and the Mother could not have, on this earlier day of the Sofa Incident, disciplined the Complainant over the Lunchbox Incident which happened only in the future on 10 January 2017. This also cut through the “core” of the Defence’s case theory of a supposed “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017 (the date of the Lunchbox Incident) which allegedly led to the Complainant falsely accusing the accused of the Three Incidents. If the Sofa Incident (during which the accused had disciplined the Complainant over her necklace) had indeed happened on a day before the day the Lunchbox Incident happened on 10 January 2017, the earlier day (on which the Sofa Incident had happened) would then have been that first, and only, occasion on which the accused had ever disciplined the Complainant. He could not have then disciplined the Complainant, again, over the subsequent Lunchbox Incident on the evening of 10 January 2017 because this occasion of disciplining her on the evening of 10 January 2017 (if it happened) would then have been the _second_ occasion on which he had disciplined her. However, it was common ground between the parties (as well as the Defence’s case theory) that the accused had only ever disciplined her on one occasion.

(C)   Sofa Incident happened in 2016

225    The Defence argued that the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony supported its case that the Sofa Incident (during which the accused had disciplined the Complainant over a necklace) happened on 10 January 2017. According to the Defence, this was because the Stepmother had “confirmed that \[the Complainant\] was gifted with a white-gold necklace for her birthday and \[had\] agreed that it was possible for \[this necklace\] to have been given in 2016 for \[the Complainant’s 14th\] birthday” on 21 December 2016.[\[note: 335\]](#Ftn_335) As such, the Defence contended that “the said “necklace” could have become an issue only in January 2017 when \[the Complainant\] wore it to school…and not in 2016 as alleged by the Prosecution”.[^336]

226    But, this argument was dependent on whether the Sofa Incident involved the _same_ necklace which the Complainant’s Father and Stepmother had given to her for her 14th birthday (on 21 December 2016). However, the Complainant never testified that the Sofa Incident involved _this_ necklace. Indeed, her testimony was that she did not remember, or was “not sure”, when her Father and Stepmother had given her the necklace that was the subject of the Sofa Incident:[\[note: 337\]](#Ftn_337)

> Q:    \[H\]ow did you \[come\] into possession of this necklace?

> A:    \[M\]y dad and stepmum gave it to me.

> **Q:**      **When did your dad and your stepmum \[give this\] necklace to you?**

> **A:**      **…I don’t remember.**

> Q:    Okay. What type of necklace \[was\] this?

> A:    \[I\]t was a white-gold \[necklace\].

> …

> **Q:**      **…When did they present this white-gold \[necklace\] to you…?**

> A:    When?

> Q:    When?

> **A:**      **I’m not sure.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

227    In any event, the Defence never put it to the Complainant that the Sofa Incident involved the very necklace which her Father and Stepmother had given her for her 14th birthday. The Stepmother was also not in a position to confirm that the Sofa Incident involved _this_ necklace as she was not present during the incident. Indeed, the Stepmother had testified that she had given “a lot of chains” to the Complainant. The Stepmother also could not remember if the necklace she and the Father gave to the Complainant for her 14th birthday was given before or after her birthday on 21 December 2016. In addition, the Complainant testified that she never wore the necklace that was the subject of the Sofa Incident to School. Indeed, her consistent testimony was that she did not remember if she was even wearing a necklace during the Sofa Incident.[\[note: 338\]](#Ftn_338) I therefore saw no merit in the Defence’s submission that the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony supported its case that the Sofa Incident had happened on 10 January 2017.

228    The Defence also argued that the WhatsApp correspondence between the accused and the Mother on 10 January 2017[\[note: 339\]](#Ftn_339) supported its case that its version of the Sofa Incident had happened on this same date.[^340] I was mindful that the correspondence showed that the accused had offered to “intervene” and “talk”/“speak” “some sense” to the Complainant to “realign her back”. Based on the correspondence, this offer was made sometime between 10:21am and 11:26am on 10 January 2017. The Mother also appeared to have accepted this offer at about 10:23am that same day. But this correspondence[^341] did not show that the accused did, in fact, speak to the Complainant later that same evening (whether about the Lunchbox Incident, a necklace, or on any other matter).

229    Indeed, there were two aspects of the Complainant’s testimony that supported a finding that the Sofa Incident happened in 2016 (and before the Lunchbox Incident, which happened on 10 January 2017). The first was the Defence’s acceptance of the Complainant’s testimony that she had been seeing her Father and Stepmother, and “going back to her grandparents’ house”, on weekends after the Sofa Incident. The Defence also never challenged her testimony that she had met her Father and Stepmother on “\[q\]uite a lot” of occasions after the Sofa Incident. I set out the Complainant’s testimony on these aspects:[\[note: 342\]](#Ftn_342)

> Q:    You see, going by your…own evidence, you see, this pulling down of the collar to see the inside of your T-shirt \[_viz_ the Sofa Incident\] happened some time in 2016.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    You can’t remember the date?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    You can’t remember the month?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **But you have been seeing your \[Father\] and \[Stepmother\] over the weekend\[s\].**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **\[A\]fter \[the Sofa Incident\] …how many occasion\[s\] have you met your \[Father\] and \[Stepmother\]?**

> **A:**      **Quite a lot.**

> Q:    Did you tell your \[Father\]?

> A:    No.

> …

> **Q:**      **So…even \[on\] weekends after this \[Sofa Incident\] happened, you have been going back to your grandparent’s house. Are you?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

230    The Defence’s acceptance of these aspects of the Complainant’s testimony was significant. If the Sofa Incident had indeed happened on 10 January 2017 (the date of the Lunchbox Incident), the Complainant would not have then been able to meet her Father and Stepmother on “\[q\]uite a lot” of occasions after the Sofa Incident (and before the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017). She would also not have been able to go to her grandparents’ residence on “weekends” after the Sofa Incident. This was in light of her living arrangements at that time – which meant that she would have been able to only meet her Father and Stepmother or her grandparents over the _single_ weekend of 14-15 January 2017 if the Sofa Incident had happened on 10 January 2017 (and before the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017). In addition, the Defence never disputed the Stepmother’s 2021 testimony that she had not, in fact, met the Complainant over the weekend of 14-15 January 2017 (because the Mother had punished the Complainant that weekend).[\[note: 343\]](#Ftn_343) This meant that the Sofa Incident must have happened before 10 January 2017 and, specifically, in 2016 (as was the Complainant’s testimony) – for it was only in this case that she would have been able to meet her Father and Stepmother on “\[q\]uite a lot” of occasions after the Sofa Incident (before the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017) and her grandparents on “weekends” after the Sofa Incident (before the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017).

231    The second aspect of the Complainant’s testimony related to four photographs of the interior of the Flat which had been taken by the accused. The Complainant was shown these photographs during her cross-examination on the Sofa Incident.[\[note: 344\]](#Ftn_344) One of these photographs showed the location of the sofa on which she and the accused had sat during the Sofa Incident. The sofa in this photograph was _red_. But, the Complainant’s _unchallenged_ testimony was that she and the accused had been sitting on the “previous” “_black_ sofa” at the time of the Sofa Incident.[^345] She was unable to recall when this “black sofa” was replaced by the red sofa seen in the photograph.[^346] However, the accused later testified that he had taken these photographs (including the photograph showing the _red_ sofa) sometime “before mid-2016”.[^347] This necessarily meant that the Sofa Incident, which involved the “previous” “black sofa”, happened sometime before mid-2016 (when the accused had taken these photographs). This was consistent with the Complainant’s testimony that the Sofa Incident happened sometime in 2016 (and not on 10 January 2017, the date of the Lunchbox Incident).

232    Drawing together these strands of the Complainant’s testimony, I made the following findings:

> (a)     The Sofa Incident had happened sometime in 2016.

> (b)     As the Lunchbox Incident had happened on 10 January 2017, the Sofa Incident and the Lunchbox Incident had taken place on _different_ days (and in _different_ years).

> (c)     Only the accused had spoken to the Complainant, and disciplined her, about a necklace during the Sofa Incident in 2016. The Mother had not similarly done so on this occasion.

> (d)     Only the Mother had spoken to the Complainant about the Lunchbox Incident on 10 January 2017. The accused had not spoken to the Complainant, or disciplined her, about the Lunchbox Incident or a necklace on the day of the Lunchbox Incident (on 10 January 2017). Had this indeed happened, it would have been the _second_ occasion on which he had disciplined her – contradicting the common ground between the parties (and the Defence’s case theory) that the accused had only ever disciplined the Complainant on one occasion.

233    The Defence had also argued that the Mother’s testimony supported its case that the Sofa Incident (during which the accused had disciplined the Complainant over a necklace) happened on 10 January 2017. According to the Defence, this was because the Mother had “testified that the necklace \[that was the subject of the Sofa Incident\] was a gift for \[the Complainant’s\] birthday which fell on 21 December 2016.[\[note: 348\]](#Ftn_348) The Defence submitted that this meant that the Complainant “only had \[this necklace at the end of 2016 and \[therefore\], the \[Sofa Incident\], in all probability, only happened on 10 January 2017”.[^349]

234    As mentioned above, the Defence never put it to the Complainant that the Sofa Incident involved _the_ necklace which her Father and Stepmother had given her for her 14th birthday.[\[note: 350\]](#Ftn_350) I was mindful that it was not disputed that the Mother was in the kitchen when the Sofa Incident happened.[^351] The Mother would therefore have arguably been able to confirm that the Sofa Incident involved _this_ necklace. But, it was also the Mother’s testimony that the Sofa Incident happened on 10 January 2017 (the date of the Lunchbox Incident). I therefore gave no weight to the Mother’s testimony in this regard given my findings that:[^352]

> (a)     the Sofa Incident had happened sometime in 2016, and not on 10 January 2017; and

> (b)     only the accused (and not the Mother) had spoken to the Complainant about a necklace during the Sofa Incident in 2016.

235    In addition, I found that the Sofa Incident probably happened _before_ the Complainant’s 14th birthday on 21 December 2016. This was in light of the:

> (a)     undisputed evidence that the Complainant and the accused were:[\[note: 353\]](#Ftn_353)

>> (i)       at a chalet between 21 to 23 December 2016; and

>> (ii)       in Kuala Lumpur between 25 to 30 December 2016.

> (b)     school holiday arrangements between the Complainant’s Father and Mother[\[note: 354\]](#Ftn_354), which meant that the Complainant was with the Mother and the accused from 21 December 2016 to 31 December 2016.

> (c)     undisputed evidence that the Complainant was able to meet her Father and Stepmother on “\[q\]uite a lot” of weekends after the Sofa Incident (and before the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017).[\[note: 355\]](#Ftn_355)

> (d)     accused’s testimony that his photograph of the _red_ sofa was taken “before mid-2016”, which meant that the Sofa Incident – which involved the “previous” “_black_ sofa” – had happened before the middle of 2016.[\[note: 356\]](#Ftn_356)

236    Incidentally, I noted that the accused’s cautioned statement in relation to the Sofa Incident (which was recorded on 20 June 2018 and admitted into evidence by the Defence)[\[note: 357\]](#Ftn_357) bolstered my finding that the Sofa Incident had happened sometime in 2016 and before the Complainant’s 14th birthday on 21 December 2016. Even though the charge attached to this statement averred that:

> (a)     the accused had “pull\[ed\] down \[the Complainant’s\] tee shirt to see the necklace on her neck” “sometime in \[the\] Year 2016 at or about 7.00pm” in the Flat, and

> (b)     the Complainant was “13 years old” (_viz_, before her 14th birthday on 21 December 2016),

the accused failed to mention that this incident had happened on 10 January 2017 instead (_viz_, after the Complainant’s 14th birthday on 21 December 2016).

237    Indeed, the accused had stated only the following in his statement:

> I wish to say that I did not have the intent to insult the modesty of \[the Complainant\]. I was advising her to remove the necklace as she has been wearing it to class. I was also telling her that it could attract unnecessary attention as it is an expensive necklace.

238    To my mind, the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention that this incident had happened on 10 January 2017 instead when his statement was recorded on 20 June 2018. The accused’s failure to mention this aspect in his cautioned statement was _possibly_ a ground for drawing an adverse inference against him to corroborate the Complainant’s testimony that the Sofa Incident had happened sometime in 2016 (and not on 10 January 2017).[\[note: 358\]](#Ftn_358) But, I did not eventually draw an adverse inference against the accused in this regard because the Prosecution had not confronted the accused about this omission during his cross-examination. No submissions had also been made by either party on this point. That said, I was mindful that the accused’s cautioned statement (which was admitted into evidence by the Defence as _his_ exhibit) was inconsistent with his testimony (and the Mother’s testimony) that the Sofa Incident had happened on 10 January 2017 (the same date of the Lunchbox Incident).

(D)   Failure to react or seek help not unreasonable

239    The Defence submitted that the Complainant’s “lack of resistance and inaction” during the Sofa Incident created a reasonable doubt within the Prosecution’s case.[\[note: 359\]](#Ftn_359) As with its submissions in relation to the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident, they were underpinned by the fallacy that victims of sexual offences should react in a certain manner. However, the Complainant had testified that she was “shocked” when the accused suddenly pulled the neckline of her T-shirt up and looked inside her T-shirt. She explained that she did not react when he did this because she was “scared” of him.[^360] She also explained that she did not tell the Mother about what he had done because she knew that the Mother did not trust her and would not believe her even if told:[^361]

> Q:    So, you said that \[the accused’s\] hand was \[hovering\] over your breast…was your mother present in the house at that moment?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And you didn’t tell her?

> A:    No.

> Q:    Why?

> **A:**      **Because she might tell me off. She may say…just…forget about it and that \[it\] is nothing serious.**

> Q:    Do you consider it serious?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And yet, you didn’t even bother to think to tell her.

> A:    Because even if I were to tell her, she wouldn’t---

> Q:    No. Yes or no? Then later, I’ll ask you to explain.

> A:    I did---

> Q:    Yes or no?

> A:    thought about telling her.

> Q:    But the fact remains you didn’t tell her.

> A:    Yes.

> Court:    Well, she wanted to explain.

> …

> **A:**      **…I know that if I were to tell her…she wouldn’t believe me even though she saw it in front of her own eyes. Because…ever since she got remarried, she has always side\[d\] her husband and she has never like side \[with\] me, she never…even believe whatever I would say.**

> …

> Q:    So, you didn’t do anything about it?

> A:    I planned about telling someone. But I didn’t execute it.

> Q:    When you intend to execute it?

> **A:**      **I planned to tell my mum first, but only after she has gain trust in me.**

> Q:    And just for completeness, how long do you think your mother is going to take before she trust\[s\] you?

> A:    Maybe a year or so.

> Q:    What do you mean? Living with them for nearly about 2 years by then.

> A:    Yah.

> **Q:**      **And you assume your mother still don’t trust you.**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> …

> **Q:**      **What’s the basis for such a conclusion?**

> **A:**      **‘Cause…if she were to trust me…she wouldn’t…been so strict on me. She would understand that I would want to spend some time with my friends to relieve my stress. She would agree to let me spend a few minutes or…maybe an hour or so with my friends to let me relieve my stress but she didn't. And then, whenever I want to go…over to my father’s house…she would sometimes disagree because she thinks that my father is somehow a bad influence to me. If she have trust in me, she would believe that I wouldn’t follow their bad footsteps.**

240    Given the Complainant’s strained relationship with the Mother[\[note: 362\]](#Ftn_362) and that she was only 13 years old at the time of the Sofa Incident, her “lack of resistance and inaction” after this incident was not unreasonable. Indeed, had she been bent on ensuring that the allegations she had purportedly fabricated would stick, she _would have_ alerted the Mother and the Helper (as well as others, such as her Stepmother; the Teacher; and the Counsellor) about the all three incidents so as to establish a prior and consistent pattern of inappropriate conduct by the accused.[^363]

##### (4)   Delayed disclosure did not dent credibility

241    The Defence pointed out that the Complainant’s testimony and the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony[\[note: 364\]](#Ftn_364) were inconsistent on when she had disclosed to her Stepmother that the accused had molested her. The Complainant said she did so sometime towards the end of 2016.[^365] In contrast, her Stepmother said she did so in the first week of January 2017, when she had just started Secondary 3.[^366]

242    Following the Prosecution’s disclosure of statements[\[note: 367\]](#Ftn_367), Counsel applied to recall _only_ the Stepmother (and _not_ the Complainant[^368] or her Father, whose statements had also been disclosed). Counsel averred that the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony was inconsistent with her previous statements, and she wished to admit these inconsistent aspects of the Stepmother’s statements as substantive evidence against the Stepmother, under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (_viz_, to “substitute” the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony with the allegedly inconsistent aspects of her previous statements).[^369] The Prosecution accepted that this would be a valid basis to admit these statements (_assuming_ they were indeed inconsistent with the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony), and indicated that it was not opposing Counsel’s application.[^370] The Stepmother was hence recalled on 19 February 2021.

(A)   Stepmother’s credibility not impeached

243    At the hearing on 19 February 2021, Counsel drew the Stepmother’s attention to three aspects of her 2019 testimony:[\[note: 371\]](#Ftn_371)

> (a)     That the Complainant had asked her about the meaning of “molest” sometime at the end of 2016.

> (b)     That the Complainant had texted her sometime in the first week of January 2017, when the Complainant had just started Secondary 3, to inform her that the accused had molested her.

> (c)     That she had then met the Complainant over the first weekend of January 2017 (_viz_, between 7 and 8 January 2017), where she asked the Complainant about what had happened.

244    Already aware of Counsel’s intended application[\[note: 372\]](#Ftn_372), I had observed the Stepmother very closely when her attention was drawn to these aspects of her 2019 testimony. She was adamant when confirming that she was standing by these aspects of her 2019 testimony.[^373]

245    Counsel then applied to cross-examine the Stepmother on her previous statements, pursuant to s 147(1) of the Evidence Act.

246    The Stepmother’s first statement was recorded on 13 February 2018 (the “1st statement”). Its key paragraphs read as follows (with the allegedly inconsistent aspects that were underlined by Counsel reflected as well):[\[note: 374\]](#Ftn_374)

> 2.     One or two days before the date of this police report made by \[the Complainant on 18 January 2017\], I received a sms message from \[the Complainant\] informing me that she thinks that she has been molested. I then asked her who, and she told me “Encik” which refers to her \[the accused\]. I then asked if she was sure of it, and she swear to God that it was true. She insisted that I do not tell anyone about this matter as she \[was\] worried that her \[Father\] would do something to \[the accused\]; and then her \[Father\] would get into trouble. So, I kept it a secret.

> 3.     The next day when I asked \[the Complainant\] about this matter, \[the Complainant\] said that she still not ready to report. In the evening of this same day, my husband \[ _viz_ , the Complainant’s Father\] received a call from school informing that \[the Complainant\] had informed her school counsellor that she has been molested. Thus, my husband and I rushed down to Bedok Police Station; and after \[the\] Police interview, my husband \[_viz_, the Father\] and I brought her home to stay with us. Since then, she has been staying with us.

> \[underlining in original by Counsel\]

247    The Stepmother’s second statement was recorded on 21 February 2018 (the “2nd statement”). Its key paragraph read as follows (with the allegedly inconsistent aspects that were underlined by Counsel reflected as well):[\[note: 375\]](#Ftn_375)

> 5.    After \[the Complainant\] told me about the molest case, I did not inform my husband \[_viz_, the Complainant’s Father\], and reason given by me in my previous statement. Before the day that \[the Complainant\] revealed the molest case to me, she did not tell me directly that she was being molested. However, she did ask me what is the meaning of molest; and that was about one week before she revealed the molest case to me.

> \[underlining in original by Counsel\]

248    Counsel averred there were three inconsistencies between the Stepmother’s previous statements and her 2019 testimony:[\[note: 376\]](#Ftn_376)

> (a)     The first inconsistency was on when the Complainant had asked her Stepmother about the meaning of “molest”.

> (b)     The second inconsistency was on when the Complainant had texted her Stepmother to inform her that the accused had molested her.

> (c)     The third inconsistency, a “by-product” of the first and second inconsistencies, was whether the Complainant and her Stepmother had then met over a weekend in January 2017 (before 18 January 2017, when the Report was lodged), after the Complainant had texted her Stepmother and informed her that the accused had molested her.

249    The Prosecution acknowledged that the Stepmother’s previous statements and her 2019 testimony were inconsistent “insofar as the dates \[were\] concerned”. However, it submitted that the Stepmother had “largely been consistent” on the “events” concerned. Nonetheless, the Prosecution stated that the Stepmother should be given the chance to explain as these inconsistencies related to a material part of the Defence’s case.[\[note: 377\]](#Ftn_377) Counsel was thus allowed to cross-examine the Stepmother on her previous statements, under s 147(1) of the Evidence Act. It was Counsel’s position that the sentences she had underlined in these statements[^378] reflected the truth and so should be admitted as substantive evidence against the Stepmother under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, to “substitute” the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony.[^379]

250    I noted that _even if_ the Stepmother’s previous statements and her 2019 testimony were inconsistent on:

> (a)     when the Complainant had asked her about the meaning of “molest”; and

> (b)     whether she and the Complainant had met over a weekend in January 2017 (before 18 January 2017, when the Report was lodged), after the Complainant texted and informed her that the accused had molested her,

neither of these aspects (regardless of whether the version in the Stepmother’s previous statements or her 2019 testimony reflected the truth) were inconsistent with the Complainant’s testimony. This was because the Complainant never testified on either aspect. Indeed, she had said that she could _not_ recall _how_ she had informed her Stepmother that the accused had molested her.[\[note: 380\]](#Ftn_380)

251    The Stepmother confirmed she made both statements.[\[note: 381\]](#Ftn_381) Counsel first directed her to the following aspects of her 2019 testimony and her 1st statement:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.98%"><col width="50.02%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>2019 testimony</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>1<sup>st</sup> statement</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Complainant had texted her sometime in the first week of January 2017, when the Complainant had just started Secondary 3, to inform her that the accused had molested her.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2. <u>One or two days before the date of this police report made by [the Complainant on 18 January 2017], I received a sms message from [the Complainant] informing me that she thinks that she has been molested</u>.

She insisted that I do not tell anyone about this matter as she [was] worried that her biological father [<em>viz</em>, her Father] would do something to her step-father; and then her biological father would get into trouble. So, I kept it a secret.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

252    These aspects were inconsistent. The Stepmother’s 2019 testimony was that the Complainant had texted her sometime in the first week of January 2017, when she had just started Secondary 3. As the 2017 school term had begun on 3 January 2017[\[note: 382\]](#Ftn_382), this meant that the Complainant had texted her Stepmother sometime between 3 and 6 January 2017. However, the Stepmother’s 1st statement implied that the Complainant had only texted her on 16 or 17 January 2017 (_viz_, one or two days before the Report, which was lodged on 18 January 2017).

253    When asked to confirm if this aspect of her 1st statement was true (_ie_, that the Complainant had texted her only one or two days before the Report was lodged), the Stepmother _immediately_ said “No” – even though she could not recall when the Report had, in fact, been lodged.[\[note: 383\]](#Ftn_383) Her perplexed demeanour at this point supported her assertion that she could remember when the Report was lodged.

254    The Stepmother was then told that the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017, and Counsel repeated her questions. But, she still testified, unhesitatingly and repeatedly, that this aspect of her 1st statement was “wrong” (_ie_, that the Complainant had _not_ texted her on 16 or 17 January 2017, one or two days before the Report was lodged, to inform her that the accused had molested her):[\[note: 384\]](#Ftn_384)

| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. And according to \[your 1st statement\] that you have in your hand…\[my\] question was, \[the Complainant\] sent you the SMS 1 or 2 days before \[the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017\] because this is what you have written down, yes. Do you agree?

 |
| 

**A:**

 | 

Uh, **I’m might get the dates wrong because at this point of time, what I am think of is about \[the Complainant’s Father\]**, what will—

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

You---you---just have to tell us---because this is your statement.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

In Court on the 9th of July 2019, you said you could not recall and you said that it \[was\] sometime in the 1st week of January \[2017\].

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So, we are just trying to draw your attention to \[the statement\] that you made and signed which said that it was 1 or 2 days before the \[Report on 18 January 2017\] that \[the Complainant\] SMSed you. So, are you saying, is it yes or no, that it is correct?

 |

**A:**

 | 

**Actually it’s wrong.**

**Court:**

**So, the statement is incorrect?**

**A:**

 | 

**In the \[statement\], yes.**

 |
| 

**…**

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

**…So, you are saying that paragraph 2 of \[your 1st statement\], that is not correct.**

**\[A\]:**

 | 

**Yes.**

255    The Stepmother explained that she had not clarified this aspect of her 1st statement with the police as she had not known, when she made this statement, that she would have to eventually testify in court. She said that her husband (the Complainant’s Father) had not known, when she made this statement on 13 February 2018, that the Complainant had, in fact, told her “much earlier” than 16 or 17 January 2017 that the accused had molested her.

256    Counsel then asked the Stepmother if she had therefore lied to the police on this aspect of her statement (_ie_, if she had lied when she stated that the Complainant had only texted her one or two days before the Report was lodged to inform her that the accused had molested her). The Stepmother was visibly flustered at Counsel’s suggestion that she had lied to the police. But, she _nonetheless_ repeated that the Complainant had told her “much earlier” than 16 or 17 January 2017 that the accused had molested her.

257    The Stepmother said that she had not known, on 18 January 2017 (the date the Report was lodged), that the Complainant had already informed the police of her disclosure to her (the Stepmother). As such, she “didn’t think of anything else” after 18 January 2017 and waited for the police “to come to \[her\] for \[a\] statement”. It was only after a year that the police “suddenly” called her (on 13 February 2018) to record her statement. She “didn’t really think much about the dates” when she made her statement and might have thus got them “mixed up” or “wrong”.[\[note: 385\]](#Ftn_385)

258     _After_ her 1st statement was recorded, the Stepmother said she “tried to recall back \[but\] just couldn’t recall” when the Complainant had told her that the accused had molested her. She said she then spoke to the Complainant and asked her if she recalled this fact.[\[note: 386\]](#Ftn_386) Although the Complainant told her that it was sometime in December 2016 or January 2017, the Stepmother said she still “couldn’t…really figure out when exactly”. In re-examination, she said she did not discuss the “timing” of the Complainant’s disclosure with the Complainant. She said she only asked the Complainant about what the accused had done to her, as she just wanted to have “a clear picture of what exactly ha\[d\] been happening to \[the Complainant\] because \[she\] want\[ed\] \[the Complainant\] to tell \[her\] the truth”.[^387]

259    The Stepmother added that after she gave her 1st statement, her mind was occupied by the fact that she would have to inform her husband (the Complainant’s Father) about what had happened to the Complainant, and she was “worried”. As such, she “didn’t actually think \[about\] what exactly” she had stated in her statement. She said her husband only knew that the Complainant had been molested but he did not know what had exactly happened to her.[\[note: 388\]](#Ftn_388)

260    Counsel then asked the Stepmother to state her position as to when the Complainant had texted to inform her that the accused had molested her. The Stepmother was, again, firm when stating that she was standing by her 2019 testimony that this had happened in the first week of January 2017:[\[note: 389\]](#Ftn_389)

> Q:    …You have just given evidence that you couldn’t recall and so you may not be very clear about the dates even though your \[1st statement\] to the police very clearly says 1 or 2 days before \[the Report\], right?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **… And what is your statement now?**

> **A:**      **I stand by my statement that I informed the Judge last year that---**

> **Q:**      **That is sometime in 1st week of January \[2017\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes, yes.**

> **Q:**      **So, you are going to stand by that?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

261    As Counsel had cut the Stepmother off while she was explaining, I allowed the Stepmother to finish her explanation. The Stepmother then explained that when the 1st statement was recorded from her on 13 February 2018, her husband (the Complainant’s Father) had not known that the Complainant had already informed her “much earlier” that the accused had molested her. According to the Stepmother, her husband was “very bad-tempered” and blamed her for “everything” that had happened to the Complainant. She was therefore “worried”, at the time her 1st statement was recorded, that something untoward would happen to her marriage if her husband learnt that the Complainant had, in fact, informed her “much earlier” that the accused had molested her:[\[note: 390\]](#Ftn_390)

> 
| 

Court:

 | 

…Ms Malathy, actually she was trying to explain then you had cut her off.

 |
| 

\[Counsel\]:

 | 

Yes, Your Honour. Should I give her some more time---to explain?

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

You---you can carry on explaining.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

On paragraph 2 \[of the 1st statement\], so---

 |
| 

\[Counsel\]:

 | 

Paragraph 2, yes.

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

**why did you say what you said in paragraph 2 \[of your 1st statement\]?**

 |
| 

**A:**

 | 

Okay. **At that point of time \[when the 1st statement was being recorded from me on 13 February 2018\]….\[the Complainant’s Father\] doesn’t know anything that \[the Complainant\] has actually informed me. So, when I do the \[statement\], basically, in my mind, I think that…if my husband happens to know that actually \[the Complainant\] tells me earlier---much earlier than what exactly is** much earlier, **I worried that my marriage, you know, there might be something because my husband is very bad-tempered. So, I’ve seen him scolding me for everything that happens to \[the Complainant\], I will get the blame.** So, at the point in time I didn’t really think hard enough before I put it in that my statement will have a big impact on \[the Complainant’s\] Court’s case. **So, my mind is---I’m worried about my marriage.**

262    The Stepmother repeated that she was “sticking to” her 2019 testimony that the Complainant had texted her sometime in the first week of January 2017 to inform her that the accused had molested her. The Stepmother was then asked if she could be more precise about when this happened. A calendar was extended to her, and she ticked off 3, 4, and 5 January 2017.[\[note: 391\]](#Ftn_391) She explained that she was sure that the Complainant had texted her on one of these dates for two reasons:[^392]

> (a)      First, she remembered that the Complainant had “just started Sec 3” and that it was “the 1st week of \[the Complainant\] starting school” when the Complainant informed her that the accused had molested her.

> (b)      Second, she remembered “actually get\[ting\] to see” the Complainant only over the weekend of 7 and 8 January 2017 (after she received the Complainant’s texts sometime between 3 and 5 January 2017) and _not_ over the following weekend (_viz_, between 14 and 15 January 2017). She recalled that the Mother had punished the Complainant over the weekend of 14 and 15 January 2017 and they had therefore not seen each other that weekend (as the Complainant did not come over to stay that weekend). She also remembered that her husband (the Complainant’s Father) had received the call from the Principal only after that weekend of 14 and 15 January 2017.

263    The Stepmother recalled asking the Complainant, over the weekend of 7 and 8 January 2017 (when they had met each other[\[note: 393\]](#Ftn_393)), when the Complainant would be “ready to talk to \[her\]…ready to inform”. The “next week” (_viz_, the week commencing 9 January 2017), the Stepmother said she received “1 message” from the Complainant informing her that she was “still not ready to say”. The Stepmother said she therefore told the Complainant, “Okay. Why not over the \[coming\] weekend[^394], we decide? And then after that, we tell your \[Father\]” \[and decide\] whether we make a police report or…where do we go from there?”[^395]

264    The Stepmother said that her 1st statement was “definitely not correct” in stating that the Complainant had texted her only one or two days before the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017 (_viz_, on 16 or 17 January 2017). She explained that this was because she had been under the “impression”, when she made her 1st statement, that her “husband would blame \[her\] because she kn\[e\]w this thing earlier than what ha\[d\] been written \[in her 1st statement\]”.[\[note: 396\]](#Ftn_396) The following exchange then ensued between Counsel and the Stepmother, as Counsel tried to question the logic underlying the Stepmother’s “impression”:[^397]

> **Q:**     So…how does it affect you by saying that if it’s 1 or 2 days before \[the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017\] or if you knew earlier. **If going by what you say, if you knew earlier, like for example 3rd, 4th or 5th \[of January 2017\], isn’t that worse than knowing it 1 or 2 days before the \[Report was lodged on 18 January 2017\].** You’re contradicting yourself. **If you are so concerned that you husband would be angry with you because you knew earlier and you did not tell \[him\], doesn’t it make it worse than you knew it on the 3rd, 4th or 5th \[of January 2017\] and you allowed \[the Complainant\] to go back \[to the Flat\] and stay with \[the accused\]?** And then only reveal to him much later, isn’t that worse? It doesn’t gel…with what you are saying. Perhaps you want to think a bit more and answer.

> **A:**     Okay. In my mind at that point in time \[when my 1st statement was recorded\] I didn’t really think about the timing whether is it going to be worse if I tell \[my husband\] maybe a week or 2 weeks earlier or maybe 2 or 3 days earlier. **For me is, if I tell him \[that the Complainant had told me this\] maybe a week earlier, it’ll be worse than if I tell him \[she had done so\] 2 to 3 days later. Because I know my husband. Because every time…anything…happened to \[the Complainant\], sometimes I can be blamed.**

> Q:    Ma’am, we are just running around in circles.

> A:    Yah.

> Q:    We are running around in circles because you have made a statement to the police which you said is true and correct and then now, you’re changing your statement claiming that your husband will be very unhappy if he found out that you knew earlier. So, when I questioned you, you know, that it doesn’t make sense for you to have known much earlier than 1 or 2 days before \[the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017, as stated in the 1st statement\], you are not giving me a straight answer.

> **A:**     But that’s---I mean, yah, **I might be wrong on the dates and everything** but this is what my thought \[process was\] at the point of time \[my 1st statement was recorded\].

> Q:    So, you are trying to say that you were very wrong in 2018 February \[when the 1st statement was recorded\] but now you are very right \[in February 2021\]?

> **A:**      **Because I---just want to make things straight. I think after telling my husband what happened and then looking at \[the Complainant\], I tell myself that whatever happens, I have to make this straight. Because the truth is, yes \[the Complainant\] definitely tell me much earlier---than what I’ve \[stated\] in this \[1st\] statement.**

> Q:    Why do you say that?

> A:    Because I remember that it \[when the Complainant\] started secondary school…Sec 3.

> Q:    Yes.

> A:    Yah. So that’s \[why\] I can remember that \[the Complainant\] tell me earlier.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

265    Counsel then drew the Stepmother’s attention to paragraph 3 of her 1st statement, which I reproduce below for easy reference:

> 3.     **The next day when I asked \[the Complainant\] about this matter, \[the Complainant\] said that she \[was\] still not ready to report.** In the evening of this **same day**, my husband received a call from school informing that \[the Complainant\] had informed her school counsellor that she has been molested. Thus, my husband and I rushed down to Bedok Police Station; and after \[the\] Police interview, my husband and I brought her home to stay with us. Since then, she has been staying with us.

> \[Underlining in original by Counsel; emphasis added in bold\]

266    Read together with paragraph 2 of the Stepmother’s 1st statement[\[note: 398\]](#Ftn_398), paragraph 3 was also inconsistent with the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony on when the Complainant had texted to inform her that the accused had molested her. The Stepmother’s 2019 testimony was that the Complainant had texted her sometime in the first week of January 2017, when she just started Secondary 3 (_viz_, between 3 and 6 January 2017).[^399] However, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Stepmother’s 1st statement implied that the Complainant had texted her only on 17 January 2017 (as the Stepmother and Father had gone to the NPC on 18 January 2017).[^400]

267    The Stepmother said she agreed with the first sentence in paragraph 3 of her 1st statement[\[note: 401\]](#Ftn_401) (_ie_, that the Complainant had told her that she was “still not ready to report” when she asked the Complainant the “next day” “about this matter”). In this regard, she testified that the Complainant had “messaged” her while the Complainant was still in school” to inform her that she was “still not ready to report”.[^402] The Stepmother also testified that the “next day” in this sentence in her 1st statement referred to either 4 or 5 January 2017 (_ie_, that she had asked the Complainant “about this matter” on either 4 or 5 January 2017).[^403]

268    Counsel then asked the Stepmother to explain the inconsistency between:[\[note: 404\]](#Ftn_404)

> (a)     her testimony that the Complainant had texted her between 3 and 5 January 2017 to inform her that the accused had molested her; and

> (b)     paragraphs 2 and 3 of her 1st statement, which suggested that the Complainant had texted her only on 17 January 2017 to inform her that the accused had molested her.

269    The Stepmother paused for a few seconds before stating that she had been “under the pressure”, when she made her 1st statement, that her husband (the Complainant’s Father) would “blame” her. She added that she could not remember “what exactly \[SI Tan\] was asking \[her\]” at the time she provided paragraphs 2 and 3 in her 1st statement.[\[note: 405\]](#Ftn_405) She later said that as her 1st statement was recorded in 2018, she “might not remember” the question that SI Tan had asked which led her to state “in the evening of this same day” in paragraph 3 of her 1st statement. She also said that the first and second sentences in paragraph 3 of her 1st statement[^406] were not linked and that her reference to the “next day” in paragraph 3 was “from the 1st week of \[January 2017\]”. She later explained that paragraphs 2 and 3 of her 1st statement were not linked in the manner of a story or a composition.[^407]

270    Counsel pressed the Stepmother further on the underlined sentences in paragraph 3 of her 1st statement[\[note: 408\]](#Ftn_408) (which implied that the Complainant had texted her only on 17 January 2017, and not sometime between 3 and 5 January 2017, to inform her that the accused had molested her). In response, the Stepmother testified that it was the Counsellor, and not the Complainant, who had informed her on 16 or 17 January 2017 (over a call) that the Complainant had disclosed that she had been molested. The Stepmother said that she might have got this fact “mixed up”.[^409] According to the Stepmother, the Counsellor had called her in the same week before the Report was made.[^410] During this call, the Counsellor had told her[^411] that the Complainant had informed her that the accused had molested her. The Stepmother said she responded by telling the Counsellor that she “knew about this”. The Counsellor had then asked if arrangements could be made for the Complainant to stay with her, but she informed the Counsellor that she would have to discuss this with the Complainant’s Father as he did not know about the molest then.[^412] The Stepmother again said that she had been truthful in her 2019 testimony, where she had said that the Complainant had texted her in the first week of January 2017 to inform her that the accused had molested her. She denied that she was lying in court. She also denied that her 1st statement was the “correct one”. She disagreed with Counsel that she had tailored her 2019 testimony to fit the Complainant’s. She insisted that her 2019 testimony was true.[^413]

271    Counsel then asked the Stepmother as to when the Complainant had asked her about the meaning of “molest”. The Stepmother testified that the Complainant had done so when they were watching a movie sometime “during the school holiday\[s\] in December \[2016\]”.[\[note: 414\]](#Ftn_414) Counsel thus directed the Stepmother to the following paragraph in her 2nd statement, which read as follows:

> 5.    After \[the Complainant\] told me about the molest case, I did not inform my husband \[the Complainant’s Father\], and reason given by me in my previous statement. Before the day that \[the Complainant\] revealed the molest case to me, she did not tell me directly that she was being molested. However, she did ask me what is the meaning of molest; and that was about one week before she revealed the molest case to me.

272    Read together with the Stepmother’s 1st statement[\[note: 415\]](#Ftn_415) (which implied that the Complainant had texted on 17 January 2017 to inform her that the accused had molested her), this paragraph in the Stepmother’s 2nd statement intimated that the Complainant had only asked her Stepmother about the meaning of “molest” on or around 10 January 2017 (_viz_, “one week before” 17 January 2017).

273    However, the Stepmother disagreed with Counsel that the Complainant had asked her about the meaning of “molest” only from around 10 January 2017 onwards. She also disagreed with Counsel that she was “mistaken” about when the Complainant had asked her about the meaning of “molest”. She further disagreed with Counsel that she was “refusing to accept \[her\] mistake in Court because \[she\] want\[ed\] to support \[the Complainant’s\] allegations” and that she was tailoring her testimony to match the Complainant’s. In addition, she disagreed with Counsel that her previous statements reflected the truth as her memory in February 2018 (when these statements were recorded) would have been better.

274    The Stepmother explained that she had reflected on what had happened and had told herself that she had to “make this right”. As such, knowing that she was “under oath” when she testified in court in July 2019, she knew that she had to tell the truth. She explained that she had not attempted to rectify her previous statements because she did not know she could do so. She added that she had also forgotten the contents of these statements. She also said that the date she had provided in her 1st statement as to the text the Complainant had sent her to inform her that the accused had molested her was wrong, and she disagreed with Counsel that the Complainant had texted her only on 16 or 17 January 2017.[\[note: 416\]](#Ftn_416)

275    Having set out the Stepmother’s 2021 testimony, I commence analysis. I start by examining the Defence’s submissions on when the Complainant had disclosed to her Stepmother that the accused had molested her. I also explore why the Defence wished to “substitute” the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony with the inconsistent parts of her previous statements, under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (instead of seeking to only impeach her credit under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act). I then discuss why such “substitution” would not have assisted the Defence, even _if_ it was allowed. For completeness, I also explain why I nonetheless largely accepted the Stepmother’s explanations for the inconsistencies between her 2019 testimony and her previous statements, and concluded that her:

> (a)     credit was _not_ impeached under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act; and

> (b)     previous inconsistent statements were thus _not_ admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (_viz_, to “substitute” her 2019 testimony).

276    I have set out my concerns over the case theory advanced, belatedly, by the Defence through the Mother and in its closing submissions.[\[note: 417\]](#Ftn_417) Notably, this case theory made _no_ mention of the Complainant’s _earlier_ disclosure to her Stepmother – _before_ the supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017 (regardless of whether such disclosure was made at the end of 2016 (as was the Complainant’s testimony) or in the first week of January 2017 (as was the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony)). Instead, this version of the Defence’s case theory only addressed the Complainant’s _subsequent_ disclosures to her Teacher on 11 January 2017 and to the Counsellor on 13 January 2017. The failure to address the Complainant’s earlier disclosure to her Stepmother exposed a key flaw in the Defence’s case theory.

277    According to the Defence’s case theory, it was _this_ supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017 which led the Complainant to falsely implicate the accused. However, the common thread running through the Complainant’s testimony and the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony was that the Complainant had _already_ informed her Stepmother that the accused had molested her _before_ this supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017. This therefore meant that her earlier disclosure to her Stepmother (before 10 January 2017) could not have been triggered by this supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017 (as this “triggering incident” happened only _after_ her disclosure to her Stepmother at the end of 2016 or in the first week of January 2017). In addition, it had always been the Defence’s case that the accused had never once disciplined the Complainant until the evening of 10 January 2017. There was therefore also no “trigger”, until the evening of 10 January 2017, which could have caused the Complainant to feel “angry and displeased” so as to “trigger” her allegedly false accusations against the accused.

278    In her reply submissions, Counsel argued that it was “very possible” that the Complainant had disclosed to her Stepmother that the accused had molested her “within the second week of January \[2017\]” instead of in the first week of January 2017. Counsel reasoned as follows:

> 74.    \[I\]t cannot be proven that \[the Stepmother\] was informed prior to 10 January 2017. **Although \[the Stepmother\] had \[in her 2019 testimony\] suggested a date falling within the first week of January \[2017\], she also agreed that the following week she had been called down to the \[NPC\]. Since it is known that she had only been called to the \[NPC\] on the 18th of January 2017 when \[the Complainant\] was brought to \[the NPC\], a week before this would place \[the disclosure by the Complainant\] within the second week of January \[2017\], making it very possible that \[such disclosure\] took place after the \[Sofa Incident\].** As \[the Stepmother\] was unable to retrieve the \[text messages between her and the Complainant\], this date cannot be conclusively determined.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

279    Counsel then postulated a chronology of events, in her further reply submissions, that purportedly transpired after the supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017. She submitted that:[\[note: 418\]](#Ftn_418)

> (a)     the Complainant had texted her Stepmother between 11 and 13 January 2017 and disclosed that the accused had molested her (instead of in the first week of January 2017, when the Complainant had just started Secondary 3[\[note: 419\]](#Ftn_419)).

> (b)     the Complainant and her Stepmother had then met each other on 14 January 2017 (a Saturday), when the Stepmother asked the Complainant about what had happened (instead of on 7 or 8 January 2017, the first weekend of January 2017[\[note: 420\]](#Ftn_420)) .

280    I noted that the Stepmother did appear to agree with Counsel, in her 2019 testimony, that she was called down to the NPC in the week after (or “about a week”[\[note: 421\]](#Ftn_421) after) the Complainant’s disclosure to her:[^422]

> Q:    So---because---like---if we understand correctly---this---

> A:    Mmm.

> Q:    …if \[the Complainant’s disclosure to you\] happened in the 1st week of January 2017.

> A:    Yah, that will be there.

> Q:    And then the following week, I think there’s already police called you to the \[NPC\].

> A:    Yes.

281    As the Stepmother was called down to the NPC on 18 January 2017, there appeared to be some force in the Defence’s submission that the Complainant’s disclosure to her Stepmother had only taken place sometime in the second week of January 2017 (or, between 9 and 13 January 2017).[\[note: 423\]](#Ftn_423) That said, I ultimately gave _no_ weight to this submission. This was for four reasons:

> (a)     Unlike the Stepmother’s 2021 testimony, the Stepmother did not have a calendar to refer to during her 2019 testimony so as to give a more precise account of the date of the Complainant’s disclosure. Indeed, greater precision as to this date was not needed during the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony as the Defence had then never disputed the Stepmother’s testimony that the Complainant’s disclosure took place sometime in the first week of January 2017, when she had just started Secondary 3.

> (b)     The Defence had never put it to the Stepmother, during her 2019 testimony, that the Complainant had made her disclosure to her only in the second week of January 2017 (or, between 9 and 13 January 2017). As mentioned, the Defence had then also never disputed the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony that the Complainant’s disclosure took place sometime in the first week of January 2017, when she had just started Secondary 3.

> (c)     To find that the Complainant had made her disclosure to her Stepmother only in the _second_ week of January 2017 (or, between 9 and 13 January 2017) ignored the Stepmother’s consistent position, during her 2019 testimony _and_ her 2021 testimony, that the Complainant’s disclosure had taken place sometime in the _first_ week of January 2017, when she had just started Secondary 3.

> (d)     Counsel’s submission that it was “very possible” that the Complainant had made her disclosure to her Stepmother only in the second week of January 2017 (or, between 9 and 13 January 2017) was inconsistent with the Complainant’s testimony that she had _already_ made her disclosure to her Stepmother by the time of her disclosures to her Teacher on 11 January 2017 and to the Counsellor on 13 January 2017. This aspect of the Complainant’s testimony was never challenged by the Defence. It was also not open to the Defence to argue that the Complainant’s disclosure to her Stepmother had happened on 9 or 10 January 2017. This was because it was always the Defence’s case that the accused had never once disciplined the Complainant until the evening of 10 January 2017. There was therefore no “trigger”, until the evening of 10 January 2017, to supposedly trigger the Complainant to falsely implicate the accused.

282    In addition, I gave _no_ weight to Counsel’s submission that the Complainant and her Stepmother had then met on 14 January 2017 (as this submission was premised on Counsel’s submission that the Complainant had only texted her Stepmother between 11 and 13 January 2017 and disclosed that the accused had molested her, a submission I had already rejected[\[note: 424\]](#Ftn_424)). In any event, Counsel never disputed the Stepmother’s 2021 testimony that she and the Complainant had, in fact, _not_ seen each other at all over the weekend of 14 and 15 January 2017 (because the Complainant had not come over as the Mother had punished her).[^425]

283    I noted that the Teacher did say that she recalled that the Complainant had not “told anyone yet about _the_ incident” which was disclosed to her on 11 January 2017.[\[note: 426\]](#Ftn_426) Leaving aside the fact that the Teacher never explained the basis for her recollection, the Teacher’s testimony suggested that the Complainant might have made her disclosure to her Stepmother only _after_ her disclosure to her Teacher on 11 January 2017. But the nature of the Complainant’s disclosures to her Stepmother and to her Teacher were very different in each instance. Her disclosure to her Teacher had involved details relating to the Bedroom Incident. The Teacher’s testimony that the Complainant had not “told anyone yet about _the_ incident” which was disclosed to her on 11 January 2017 was hence a reference to the Bedroom Incident (_ie_, the Teacher was stating that Complainant had yet to tell anyone about the Bedroom Incident at the time they spoke on 11 January 2017). In contrast, the Complainant had only disclosed to her Stepmother that the accused had molested her. She never told her Stepmother about how the accused had molested her (_viz_, details about one or more of the Three Incidents – including the Bedroom Incident).[^427] As such, while the Complainant had not, until her disclosure to the Teacher on 11 January 2017, told anyone about the Bedroom Incident, it did not follow that she had not told her Stepmother, before 11 January 2017, that the accused had molested her. These were two very different types of disclosures – each of which was being made for the first time when they were so made.

284    In any event, it was ultimately immaterial _even if_ the Complainant had disclosed to her Stepmother, only within the second week of January 2017 (or, between 9 and 13 January 2017), that the accused had molested her. This was in light of my findings that:[\[note: 428\]](#Ftn_428)

> (a)     the accused had not spoken to, or disciplined, the Complainant about the Lunchbox Incident or a necklace on 10 January 2017; and

> (b)     the Sofa Incident had taken place in 2016, before the Complainant’s 14th birthday on 21 December 2016.

285    As such, _even if_ the Complainant had made her disclosure to her Stepmother only in the second week of January 2017 (or, between 9 and 13 January 2017, there was _no_ “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017 to begin with, to purportedly trigger her subsequent disclosure to her Stepmother in this period (as well as her later disclosures to her Teacher and the Counsellor). As there was _no_ “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017 to start with, there was hence no foundation for the Defence to then claim that the Complainant had a motive to falsely implicate the accused (as such a motive was premised on the existence of this supposed “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017).[\[note: 429\]](#Ftn_429)

286    I was mindful that the Stepmother’s 1st statement implied that the Complainant had disclosed to her Stepmother, only on 17 January 2017, that the accused had molested her.[\[note: 430\]](#Ftn_430) Had this disclosure happened on 17 January 2017, it would have happened _after_ the supposed “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017. This would then have supported the Defence’s submission that the Complainant’s disclosure to her Stepmother on 17 January 2017 was “triggered” by this supposed “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017. But, this submission would have had some force _only if_ this supposed “triggering incident” had happened on 10 January 2017. But, it ultimately had _no_ force in light of my findings that:[^431]

> (a)     the accused had not spoken to, or disciplined, the Complainant about the Lunchbox Incident or a necklace on 10 January 2017; and

> (b)     the Sofa Incident had taken place in 2016, before the Complainant’s 14th birthday on 21 December 2016.

287    As such, _even if_ the Complainant had made her disclosure to her Stepmother on 17 January 2017, there was _no_ “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017 to begin with, to purportedly trigger her subsequent disclosure to her Stepmother on 17 January 2017. As there was _no_ “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017 to start with, it could not be said that the Complainant’s disclosure to her Stepmother on 17 January 2017 stemmed from a motive to falsely implicate the accused (as such a motive was premised on the existence of this supposed “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017).[\[note: 432\]](#Ftn_432)

288    The Complainant had also testified that she had _already_ made her disclosure to her Stepmother by the time of her later disclosures to her Teacher on 11 January 2017 and to the Counsellor on 13 January 2017. This aspect of her testimony was never challenged by the Defence. The Defence’s submission that the Complainant had only made her disclosure to her Stepmother on 17 January 2017 (and thus _after_ her disclosures to her Teacher and the Counsellor) was hence also inconsistent with this aspect of the Complainant’s testimony, which the Defence failed to challenge.

289    The Stepmother’s 2nd statement implied that the Complainant had asked her Stepmother about the meaning of “molest” “about one week” before 17 January 2017.[\[note: 433\]](#Ftn_433) The Defence submitted that the Complainant had done so on 14 January 2017 – and reasoned as follows:[^434]

> 18.    …If \[it is\] accepted…that it was on 17 January 2017 that \[the Complainant\] revealed the molest case to \[her Stepmother\], then, “about 1 week before” will bring us to 10 January 2017 onwards.

> 19.    It is the Defence’s proposition that, if at all, \[the Complainant\] did ask \[her Stepmother\] such a question \[about the meaning of “molest”\], it must have been the weekend of…14 January 2017 (Saturday) or 15 January 2017 (Sunday), **following the triggering incident \[on the evening of 10 January 2017\]**.

> 20.    The **reason for this is that the setting described by \[the Stepmother\] in her \[2019 testimony\] when this question was posed to her by \[the Complainant\] suggests that \[the Stepmother\] and \[the Complainant\] were watching movies together and they seem to have met on a Saturday.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

290    But, there was _nothing_ in the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony[\[note: 435\]](#Ftn_435) which suggested that she and the Complainant were watching movies together on a _Saturday_ when the Complainant asked her about the meaning of “molest”. All that the Stepmother said in her 2019 testimony was that the Complainant had asked her this question sometime at the end of 2016 (which she stated in her 2021 testimony to have been sometime during the school holidays in December 2016).[^436] However, the Defence had never put it to the Stepmother, during her 2019 testimony or her 2021 testimony, that the Complainant had asked her this question on a Saturday (and, even then, on 14 January 2017 specifically). This was important because it was not disputed that the Complainant had spent the first half of her December 2016 school holidays, from 1 to 20 December 2016, with her Father and Stepmother. This period covered Saturdays as well as other days of the week.

291    In any event, Counsel never disputed the Stepmother’s 2021 testimony that she and the Complainant had, in fact, _not_ seen each other at all over the weekend of 14 and 15 January 2017 (because the Complainant had not come over that weekend as the Mother had punished her).[\[note: 437\]](#Ftn_437)

292    I therefore rejected the Defence’s submission that the Complainant had asked her Stepmother about the meaning of “molest” only on 14 January 2017.

293    I now discuss Counsel’s application under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act.[\[note: 438\]](#Ftn_438) The effect of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act is that previous inconsistent statements admitted during cross-examination becomes actual evidence in the case.[^439] In this regard, Counsel sought to “substitute” the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony with the following aspects of the Stepmother’s two previous statements:[^440]

> (a)     That the Complainant had asked her Stepmother about the meaning of “molest” only after 10 January 2017, and on 14 January 2017 specifically (instead of sometime at the end of 2016[\[note: 441\]](#Ftn_441)).

> (b)     That the Complainant had texted her Stepmother only on 17 January 2017 to inform her that the accused had molested her (instead of in the first week of January 2017, when the Complainant had just started Secondary 3[\[note: 442\]](#Ftn_442)).

294    These aspects of the Stepmother’s two previous statements would have supported the Defence’s case theory that the supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017 had motivated the Complainant to fabricate the Three Incidents to falsely implicate the accused. If allowed to “substitute” the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony, these aspects of the Stepmother’s two previous statements also meant that the Complainant and her Stepmother could not have then met on a weekend after the Complainant’s disclosure where the Stepmother had asked the Complainant about what had happened (as 14 January 2017 was a Saturday and there was no intervening weekend between 14 January 2017 and 17 January 2017).

295    But, _even if_ the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony was “substituted” with these aspects of her previous statements, such a substitution would have assisted the Defence _only if_ there had indeed been such a “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017. However, it was my finding that there was _no_ such “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017 to start with.[\[note: 443\]](#Ftn_443) Any “substitution” of the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony with these aspects of her previous statements would therefore have not assisted the Defence in any way.

296    For completeness, however, I nonetheless discuss why I largely accepted the Stepmother’s explanations for the inconsistencies between her 2019 testimony and her previous statements, and concluded that her:

> (a)     credit was _not_ impeached under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act; and

> (b)     previous inconsistent statements were thus _not_ admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (_viz_, to “substitute” her 2019 testimony).

297    Two points bear mention at this juncture. First, the mere fact that the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony was inconsistent with her previous statements did not inevitably mean that her credit had to be impeached under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act. To impeach a witness’s credit is to disparage or undermine her character and moral reliability and worth, so as to show that her testimony in court should not be believed because she is of such a character and moral make-up that she is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on (_Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_[\[note: 444\]](#Ftn_444) (“_Peter Kwang_”) at \[19\]). But, the ability of a witness to explain the inconsistencies between her testimony and her previous statements may save her from being discredited. For example, the witness may be able to persuade the court that her previous statements were wrong because at the time of making these statements she had been mistaken, too anxious to think clearly, or that she had intended to protect herself or someone else by not mentioning certain facts.[^445]

298     Second, it does not inevitably follow that where a witness’s testimony is inconsistent with that witness’s previous statements, the witness’s testimony was necessarily a lie while her previous statements become incontrovertible evidence. This point was made in _PP v Fazely bin Rahmat_[\[note: 446\]](#Ftn_446):

> 16    ….The statements of the accused persons, and their oral evidence are, therefore, parts of the essential material for consideration. In this case, there is a manifest discrepancy – the oral testimonies in court contradict the written statements to the police in so far as to the moment when knives were drawn. **\[The Prosecution\] argues that the statements contain the truth, and that the oral testimonies are lies because they are inconsistent with the written statements. This is, of course, too simplistic an approach…\[I\]t does not follow that once the court admits the statement into evidence it stands as incontrovertible evidence** – just because the court is of the view that it was not made under a threat, inducement or promise (as the courts have defined them to be). **The statement becomes another piece of the evidence before the court. What is stated may or may not be true. That is what the court has to consider, like any other evidence before it.** There are two more points to be made in this regard. Firstly, **even when a statement has been admitted in evidence, the maker is entitled to explain what he said and why he said what he said**. Secondly, the court’s finding of guilt or otherwise does not depend solely on whether the statements carry the truth although it must be recognised that, generally, a written statement forms a forceful piece of evidence **unless the persuasiveness of the explanation matches that force, but there is little point in listening to the oral explanation if the written statement is to be preferred as a matter of course.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

299    The persuasiveness of a witness’s explanation for the inconsistencies between her testimony and her previous statements is hence critical in assessing if her credit should be impeached under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act. This was also recognised in _Somwang Phatthanasaeng v PP_:[\[note: 447\]](#Ftn_447)

> ...If the witness admits making the former \[inconsistent\] statement, or is proved to have made it, then the two conflicting versions \[that is, the witness’s testimony and her previous statement\] must be carefully explained to \[the witness\] …and \[she\] must have a fair and full opportunity to explain the difference \[between her previous statement and her testimony\]. **If \[she can \[explain the difference \[between her previous statement and her oral testimony\], then \[her\] credit is saved**, though there may still be doubt as to the accuracy of \[her\] memory….

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

300    The credibility of a witness also has to be assessed as a whole together with the rest of the evidence adduced before the court (_Peter Kwang_ at \[21\]).

301    Where a witness is unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the inconsistencies between her previous statements and her testimony, two effects may arise: one, the witness’s credit is impeached under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act; and two, in addition to the impeachment of the witness’s credit, her previous inconsistent statements shall also be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein by virtue of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (_Peter Kwang_ at \[23\]).

302    Even then, however, the weight to be attached to statements rendered admissible by s 147(3) of the Evidence Act is governed by the factors stipulated in s 147(6) of the Evidence Act, which reads as follows:

> (6)    In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section **regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement** and, in particular, to the question **whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated**, and to the question **whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

303    Having considered the Stepmother’s explanations for the inconsistencies between her previous statements and her 2019 testimony, alongside the rest of the evidence in the round, I concluded that her credit was _not_ impeached under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act. This was for at least five reasons.

304     First, despite intense cross-examination, the Stepmother was consistent and firm in stating that she was maintaining her 2019 testimony that:[\[note: 448\]](#Ftn_448)

> (a)     the Complainant had asked her about the meaning of “molest” sometime at the end of 2016.

> (b)     the Complainant had texted her sometime in the first week of January 2017, when the Complainant had just started Secondary 3, to inform her that the accused had molested her.

> (c)     she and the Complainant had then met over the first weekend of January 2017 (_viz_, between 7 and 8 January 2017), where she asked the Complainant about what had happened.

305     Second, despite intense cross-examination, the Stepmother was consistent and firm in stating that:[\[note: 449\]](#Ftn_449)

> (a)     her 1st statement was “wrong”, “incorrect”, or “definitely not correct” on the fact of the Complainant texting her only on 16 or 17 January 2017, one or two days before the Report was lodged, to inform her that the accused had molested her.

> (b)     the Complainant had told her “much earlier” than 16 or 17 January 2017 that the accused had molested her.

306     Third, the Stepmother was adamant that the Complainant had informed her “much earlier” than 16 or 17 January 2017 that the accused had molested her, even after she was alerted to the fact that this necessarily meant that she had lied to the police in her 1st statement.[\[note: 450\]](#Ftn_450)

307     Fourth, I accepted the Stepmother’s explanation, which she _repeatedly_ expressed, for the inconsistencies between the dates that could be implied from her previous statements and the time periods she had furnished in her 2019 testimony. In this regard, she had explained that she was “worried”, at the time she made her statements (in February 2018), that her husband (the Complainant’s Father) would learn that the Complainant had, in fact, informed her “much earlier” (than one or two days before the Report) that the accused had molested her. She also added that her husband (the Complainant’s Father) was “very bad-tempered” and blamed her for “everything” that had happened to the Complainant. On this note, I was cognisant that it was not disputed that the Stepmother had played an important intermediary role which led to the Complainant staying with the Mother (and the accused), instead of her Father, on weekdays from December 2014 onwards.[\[note: 451\]](#Ftn_451) The Stepmother was hence, understandably, “worried” that something untoward would happen to her marriage to the Complainant’s Father if he learnt that the Complainant had, in fact, informed her “much earlier” (than one or two days before the Report) that the accused had molested her.[^452]

308    The Stepmother’s worry was not unfounded. Her undisputed testimony was that the Complainant’s Father had been “very angry” with her when he found out that the Complainant had, in fact, _already_ told her (the Stepmother) that she had been molested but she had not shared this information with him:[\[note: 453\]](#Ftn_453)

> Q:    \[So\] you didn’t want to tell the \[Father\]…because you didn’t want the problem to escalate \[with the Father doing “something stupid” to the accused\], but did you take any other steps?

> A:    No.

> Q:    No.

> A:    I didn’t.

> …

> Q:    Alright. And you only found out that \[the Complainant\] had taken a step when the police called you?

> A:    Uh, not me, called my husband.

> Q:    Call your husband.

> A:    The principal called \[my\] husband \[on 18 January 2017\]

> …

> Q:    So that’s when your husband found out?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Was he not very angry that you didn’t share with him?

> A:    Very---very angry. Then I tell him the rational\[e\]. I told him that, “Uh, I want to tell you, but \[the Complainant\] ---.” I mean, he knows that \[the Complainant trusted me, and then he certain things that, um, she says that, uh, I remember he says that, “I want \[the Complainant\] to trust you, so that in future if she got problem, she goes to you. Because I’m the father, I do not know how to control, I do not know how ladies act, how woman behave, and all that. Apart from you, my wife.”

309    Counsel doubted the Stepmother’s worry in relation to the Complainant’s Father as being a reason for the inconsistencies between her statements and her 2019 testimony:[\[note: 454\]](#Ftn_454)

> 71.    On this note, the Defence wishes to point out…that the “husband reason” is rather feeble. In her \[2019 testimony\], \[the Stepmother\] testified that when the \[Report\] was made (on 18 January 2017), \[the Complainant’s Father\] knew that \[the Complainant\] had informed \[the Stepmother\] earlier of the molest. And \[the Stepmother\] also testified that \[the Complainant’s Father\] was very angry but understood when \[she\] explained her rationale…

> 72.    This is an especially important point because this means that when \[the Stepmother\] gave \[her statements\] a year later on 13 February 2018 and 21 February 2018, there was no reason to be afraid since \[the Complainant’s Father\] had already found out that \[the Stepmother\] knew about the molest earlier. Therefore, the “husband reason” is but a new concoction.

310    Counsel’s submission was _not_ supported by the Stepmother’s testimony. The Stepmother _never_ testified that it was on 18 January 2017 that her husband (the Complainant’s Father) “knew that \[the Complainant\] had informed \[her\] earlier of the molest”. The Stepmother’s testimony was that it was on 18 January 2017 that the Complainant’s Father found out that the Complainant had been molested (when the Principal called him).[\[note: 455\]](#Ftn_455) Importantly, the Stepmother’s testimony was not clear as to _when_ the Complainant’s Father had, in fact, found out about the Complainant’s earlier disclosure (or even _how_ he had found out about this). More importantly, Counsel’s submission did not address the Stepmother’s testimony that her worry was really about the Complainant’s Father learning that the Complainant had, in fact, informed her “_much_ earlier” (than one or two days before the Report) that the accused had molested her.[^456]

311    Indeed, Counsel’s questioning of the Stepmother revealed just why the Stepmother was so “worried” that her marriage to the Complainant’s Father would be jeopardised if he learnt that the Complainant had, in fact, informed her “much earlier” (than one or two days before the Report) that the accused had molested her. If the Complainant had informed her Stepmother sometime between 3 and 5 January 2017 that the accused had molested her (as was the effect of the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony and 2021 testimony), this meant that the Stepmother had therefore allowed the Complainant to return to the Flat – and to the accused – after the weekend of 7 and 8 January 2017.[\[note: 457\]](#Ftn_457) The Stepmother had thus intended to protect herself and her marriage by making it appear, in her statements, that the Complainant’s disclosure to her was made only one or two days before the Report.[^458] Doing this enabled her to hide the fact that she had allowed the Complainant to return to the Flat – and to the accused – even after the Complainant had told her that the accused had molested her. It also allowed her to create the appearance that she had delayed informing her husband (the Complainant’s Father) of the Complainant’s allegation for, at most, only two days before the Report.

312    I was mindful that the Stepmother was in a difficult position when she was recalled. The dates that could be implied from her previous statements were _not_ reconcilable with the time periods she had furnished in her 2019 testimony (and this also explained her difficulties trying to explain the “link” between the paragraphs and sentences in her previous statements[\[note: 459\]](#Ftn_459)). The inconsistencies arising from her statements and her 2019 testimony meant that she had to effectively admit to having lied in either her statements to the police _or_ in her 2019 testimony in court. On this note, I accepted her 2021 testimony that having told her husband (the Complainant’s Father) about what had happened, she just wanted to “make things straight”, “whatever happens”, that the truth was that the Complainant had “definitely” informed her “much earlier” than 16 or 17 January 2017 that the accused had molested her.[^460] I also accepted her 2021 testimony that, having reflected on what had happened and knowing that she was “under oath” during her 2019 testimony in court, she wished to tell the truth in court to “make this right”.[^461] In these circumstances, the mere fact that the Stepmother’s previous statements were the “earliest form of evidence” obtained from the Stepmother or “closest in time to the facts stated therein” was not determinative.[^462]

313     Fifth, it was difficult to see _how_ the Stepmother had been lying or tailoring her 2019 testimony to fit the Complainant’s testimony on the date of the Complainant disclosure to her.[\[note: 463\]](#Ftn_463) This was because the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony and the Complainant’s testimony were, in fact, _not_ consistent on the time of the Complainant’s disclosure to her Stepmother. While the Complainant said she did so sometime towards the end of 2016, her Stepmother said she did so in the first week of January 2017 when she had just started Secondary 3.[^464]

314    In any event, no evidence was adduced to show that the Stepmother had a motive to lie and falsely implicate the accused. Indeed, it was difficult to understand _why_ the Stepmother would do so. The accused was certainly not a stranger to the Stepmother, for she was _also_ related to him. The Stepmother had, in fact, described him as a “very nice guy” when explaining why she had initially doubted the Complainant’s allegation that he had molested her.[\[note: 465\]](#Ftn_465) The Stepmother’s testimony also showed that she had not readily believed the Complainant’s allegation against the accused.[^466]

315    In addition, if it was indeed true that the Complainant had texted her Stepmother only on 17 January 2017 to inform her that the accused had molested her (instead of in the first week of January 2017)[\[note: 467\]](#Ftn_467), this would sit uncomfortably with other aspects of the Stepmother’s previous statements, the Complainant’s testimony, the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony, and the Counsellor’s testimony – all of which was _never_ challenged by the Defence. If it was true that the Complainant had informed her Stepmother only on 17 January 2017 that the accused had molested her, it then made little sense for the Complainant to also:[^468]

> (a)     insist, on 17 January 2017, that her Stepmother “not tell _anyone_ about this matter”;

> (b)     ask her Stepmother, sometime between 17 and 18 January 2017, for some time to personally tell the Mother about what had happened; and

> (c)     inform her Stepmother, on 18 January 2017, that she was “still not ready to report”.

316    This was because it was _not_ disputed that the Complainant had _already_ made at least three disclosures to individuals outside her family circle by 17 January 2017. These individuals comprised her Teacher on 11 January 2017 and the Counsellor on 13 January 2017, as well as her Principal who was given her Note to read on 16 January 2017. The Principal had also told the Complainant on 16 January 2017 that he would be informing the Child Protection Officers of her revelation.[\[note: 469\]](#Ftn_469) Why would the Complainant ask her Stepmother, on 17 January 2017, to refrain from disclosing her revelation to anyone else on or after 17 January 2017 when she had already made at least three disclosures to parties who she knew were very likely to report the matter to the authorities (who would, in turn, inevitably alert the Mother as well)? Why would the Complainant tell her Stepmother, on 18 January 2017, that she was “still not ready to report” when she had already reported the matter (whether directly to her Teacher and the Counsellor or indirectly to her Principal) to at least three other parties by this time?

317    If it was true that the Complainant had informed her Stepmother only on 17 January 2017 that the accused had molested her, this would also sit uncomfortably with another aspect of the Counsellor’s testimony – which was also _not_ challenged by the Defence. The Counsellor had testified that the Complainant had related to her, during their session on 13 January 2017, that the _first_ person she had told of the accused’s conduct was her Stepmother.[\[note: 470\]](#Ftn_470) If this was indeed the case, this meant that the Complainant’s disclosure to her Stepmother must have happened _before_ 13 January 2017 (and, more specifically, either sometime towards the end of 2016[^471] or in the first week of January 2017[^472]) and not on 17 January 2017. To accept that the Complainant had informed her Stepmother only on 17 January 2017 that the accused had molested her, would necessarily mean that the Counsellor, an independent witness, was lying or was, at least, mistaken in her account of what the Complainant had told her during their session on 13 January 2017. But the Defence never asserted that the Counsellor was lying or, at least, mistaken when the Counsellor testified. Neither did Counsel apply to recall the Counsellor to put such assertions to her. Indeed, _no_ aspect of the Counsellor’s testimony was ever challenged by the Defence. Counsel never applied to recall the Complainant as well, to put it to her that she had fabricated an elaborate account to the Counsellor about how she had first informed her Stepmother about the accused’s conduct when she only did so on 16 or 17 January 2017.

318    Further, if it was true that the Complainant was motivated by the supposed “triggering incident” on the evening of 10 January 2017 (_if_ this incident had, in fact, happened) to fabricate the Three Incidents to falsely implicate the accused, this did not explain why she:

> (a)     would only ask her Stepmother about the meaning of “molest” on 14 January 2017, and not directly implicate the accused, or provide any details of what the accused had allegedly done to her, on that day itself. Indeed, it was not disputed that the Complainant never revealed any details about what the accused had allegedly done to her to her Stepmother.[\[note: 473\]](#Ftn_473)

> (b)     would insist, on 17 January 2017, that her Stepmother “not tell anyone” else that the accused had molested her.

> (c)     would inform her Stepmother, on 18 January 2017, that she was “still not ready to report” that the accused had molested her.

> (d)     adopted a position of stoic passivity for almost a week, from 11 January 2017 (the date of her disclosure to her Teacher) to 18 January 2017 (the date the Report was lodged) and had to be brought by the CPOs to the NPC to lodge the Report.

319    I accepted that the Stepmother might not have been able to remember the exact date of the Complainant’s disclosure to her at the time her statements were recorded from her. After all, these statements were recorded slightly over a year after the Complainant’s disclosure to her. I also accepted that she might not have been able to remember, during her 2021 testimony in February 2021, the questions that SI Tan had asked her when he recorded her statements in February 2018.[\[note: 474\]](#Ftn_474)

320    That said, I had some difficulty accepting the Stepmother’s assertions that she had got the dates in her 1st statement “mixed up” or “wrong” because the police had “suddenly” called her on 13 February 2018 to record her statement and she “didn’t really think much about the dates” then.[\[note: 475\]](#Ftn_475) Although the Stepmother’s statements were recorded from her about a year after the Complainant’s disclosure, this was not a particularly lengthy period for her to be confused or mistaken on the quite distinct issue of whether the Complainant had made her disclosure to her:

> (a)     in the _first_ week of January 2017, when the Complainant had _just_ started Secondary 3; or

> (b)     only one or two days before the Report was lodged.

321    The Complainant’s allegation was a _very_ grave one. And, according to the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony, was a sudden and shocking one which led to a _very_ emotional physical meeting just a few days later.[\[note: 476\]](#Ftn_476) There has also been a subsequent discussion between the Stepmother and the Complainant on reporting the matter to the police, when to actually make the police report, and an ultimatum given by the Stepmother to the Complainant (that she would make the police report herself instead if the Complainant remained undecided by the following weekend).[^477] The Stepmother had further testified that she “didn’t get the chance” to lodge a police report prior to the deadline she gave to the Complainant because the police had called her and the Complainant’s Father down to the NPC (on 18 January 2017) before they could make a police report:[^478]

> Q:    You mention\[ed\] that, you told \[the Complainant\] that you would give her time, “if not, you will be the one who would tell the police”. Did you lodge a police report?

> A:    I didn’t get the chance, until the principal call. Because I give \[the Complainant\] about a week or so to think \[about whether she wanted to make a police report\]. \[The Complainant\] said that, over the weekday she want\[ed\] to tell her \[Mother\] about what happened. And then I told her, “Okay, I give you time. If another weekend you didn’t come, you comeback without any---anything to say that this is going to be reported, I say, I’m going---I’ll \[be\] the one to do the ting---to tell your \[Father\] and we will make a police report.” But, before we can do that, the police call\[ed\] us to go down to \[the NPC\].

322    The Stepmother had also _unhesitatingly_ testified, during her 2021 testimony that her 1st statement was wrong in stating that the Complainant had made her disclosure to her only one or two days before the Report. Importantly, she had testified to this effect when it was clear that she could not even recall the date on which the Report had, in fact, been lodged:[\[note: 479\]](#Ftn_479)

> 
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. In \[your 2019 testimony\], you were not very clear as when this SMS was sent \[to you\] by \[the Complainant\]. Do you now confirm that it was just 1 or 2 days before the date of this police report by \[the Complainant\]?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

You need to put things into perspective. The report was made on 18th of January 2017.

 |
| 

\[Counsel\]:

 | 

The police report, yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay?

 |
| 

\[Counsel\]:

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Alright. So, Madam, your answer?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

\[Counsel\]:

 | 

Sorry, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Maybe I just backtrack a bit. Do you accept that the date of \[the Complainant’s\] police report is 18th January 2017?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

I can’t remember.

 |

  
  

323    The Stepmother was therefore very clear at this point, regardless of the date of the Report, that the Complainant had not made her disclosure to her only one or two days before the Report.

324    Against this backdrop, the assertions by the Stepmother that she had got the dates in her 1st statement “mixed up” or “wrong” appeared to be an attempt on her part to explain away the fact that she had lied in her 1st statement (and her 2nd statement). I also noted that she had made these assertions, in a visibly flustered and concerned state, only when Counsel had drawn her attention to the “warning” stated on her 1st statement (that she was “bound to state truly the facts and circumstances with which \[she was\] acquainted concerning the case”) and pressed her to explain whether she had lied in this statement.[\[note: 480\]](#Ftn_480)

325    On this note, it is “settled law that the testimony of a witness need not be wholly rejected merely because \[she\] is shown to have lied on certain aspects of \[her\] evidence” (_Ramli bin Daud v PP_[\[note: 481\]](#Ftn_481)). It is also always open to a court, “having considered the circumstances of a case, to believe the evidence of any witness, so far as its essentials are concerned, without having to accept as true everything which that witness \[had said\]” (_Kalpanath_ at \[88\]). In addition, there is “no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its entirety or not at all” – and a court is “fully competent, for good and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the other” (_PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)_[^482] (“_Haji Harun_”)).

326    Given that the Stepmother had no proven motive to lie and falsely implicate the accused[\[note: 483\]](#Ftn_483), I was prepared to accept the Stepmother’s:

> (a)     otherwise clear, consistent, and coherent testimony that:[\[note: 484\]](#Ftn_484)

>> (i)       the Complainant had asked her about the meaning of “molest” sometime at the end of 2016 – and, specifically, sometime during the school holidays in December 2016.

>> (ii)       the Complainant had texted her sometime in the first week of January 2017 when she had just started Secondary 3 – and, specifically, sometime between 3 and 5 January 2017, to inform her that the accused had molested her.

>> (iii)       she and the Complainant had then met over the first weekend of January 2017 (_viz_, between 7 and 8 January 2017), where she asked the Complainant about what had happened.

> (b)     otherwise consistent explanation for the inconsistencies between the dates that could be implied from her previous statements and the time periods she had furnished in her 2019 testimony – namely, that she had wanted to protect herself and her marriage.[\[note: 485\]](#Ftn_485)

327    I also accepted the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony on the Complainant’s:

> (a)     conduct during her disclosure to her Stepmother; and

> (b)     demeanour when they subsequently met.

328    According to the Stepmother, the Complainant had taken “a long while to reply” when the Stepmother asked her who had molested her.[\[note: 486\]](#Ftn_486) She had also simply told her Stepmother that she had to “go” when her Stepmother asked her for details of what the accused had done.[^487] Indeed, it was not disputed that the Complainant never revealed to her Stepmother any details about what the accused had done to her.[^488] Had the Complainant intended to falsely implicate the accused, she would have _readily_ furnished her allegations to her Stepmother. She would have also _not_ made her Stepmother agree not to tell anybody about her disclosure.[^489] Her emotional state when she met her Stepmother was also telling.[^490] All of these aspects – which were not challenged by the Defence – added weight to the Complainant’s testimony, because it was implausible that she not only lied about what the accused had done, but also knew months ahead of a court appearance that she should conduct herself in a particular way before third parties to create an appearance of credibility (_GDC_ at \[14\]).

329    There remained, however, the inconsistency between the Complainant’s testimony and the Stepmother’s 2019 testimony on when the Complainant had disclosed to her Stepmother that the accused had molested her.[\[note: 491\]](#Ftn_491) The Complainant said she did so sometime towards the end of 2016. Her Stepmother said she did so in the first week of January 2017, when she had just started Secondary 3.[^492] To my mind, this was, ultimately, not a material discrepancy – given the passage of time[^493] and my finding that there was, in fact, no “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017 to start with. In any event, the existence of this minor discrepancy suggested that the Complainant and her Stepmother had _not_ concocted their accounts of what had transpired between them (_Haji Harun_). More importantly, the Complainant and her Stepmother were consistent on the following essential facts:[^494]

> (a)     The Complainant had only disclosed to her Stepmother that the accused had “molested” her and did not reveal any other details to her.

> (b)     The Complainant had made her disclosure to her Stepmother before the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017.

> (c)     The Stepmother did not initially believe the Complainant and the Complainant had to convince her Stepmother to believe her.

> (d)     The Stepmother had advised the Complainant to report the matter to the police, but the Complainant was reluctant to do so. This was because the Complainant wanted to first gain the Mother’s trust and then personally inform the Mother that the accused had molested her before she reported the matter to the police.

330    One aspect of the Counsellor’s testimony deserves some mention. Of the Three Incidents, the Complainant had described only the Bedroom Incident in her Note on 13 January 2017. In this regard, the Counsellor had testified that the Complainant told her that she could not remember the date of the Bedroom Incident. The Counsellor also said that the Complainant had told her that the Stepmother was “the first person” who “she did…tell”. This led the Defence to ask the Counsellor if the Counsellor knew when the Complainant had informed her Stepmother “about the touching incident”:[\[note: 495\]](#Ftn_495)

> **Q:**      **And do you know when \[the Complainant\] informed her \[Stepmother\] about the touching incident?**

> **A:**      **\[The Complainant\] mentioned that she informed her \[Stepmother\] within that week or the following day. I can’t remember. \[T\]hat means, the \[Stepmother\] knew about it much earlier.**

> **Q:**      **Within this---at or about the same time \[the Complainant\] was referred to you?**

> **A:**      **No. At about the time when the \[accused\] touched \[the Complainant’s\] breast and all.**

> …

> **A:**      **According to \[the Complainant\], the \[Stepmother\] knew quite soon after the incident**. \[The Complainant\] was able to confi\[d\]e in the \[Stepmother\]. So, the \[Stepmother\] told \[the Complainant\] to go to the police station.

> Q:    And when \[the Complainant\] inform\[ed\] you that the \[Stepmother\] told her to go to the police station, did you ask whether he \[Stepmother\] brought \[the Complainant\] to \[the\] police station?

> A:    My understanding was, the \[Stepmother\] did not volunteer to go to the police station with her, lah. Otherwise, they would have gone.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

331    The Counsellor’s testimony thus appeared to be that the Complainant had told her that she had told her Stepmother about the Bedroom Incident “quite soon” after the Bedroom Incident happened (and, more specifically, either within the same week of the Bedroom Incident or the day after the Bedroom Incident). Here, the Counsellor was merely repeating what the Complainant had told her. The Counsellor therefore had no personal knowledge of the truth of the Complainant’s statements to her. Her testimony on what the Complainant had told her about what the Complainant had apparently told her Stepmother was hence hearsay evidence[\[note: 496\]](#Ftn_496) and not admissible as evidence of the truth of its contents (_viz_, it did not establish that the Complainant had, in fact, told her Stepmother about the Bedroom Incident within the same week of the Bedroom Incident or the day after this incident).

332    The evidence adduced from the Counsellor was also not entirely clear on when the Complainant had told the Counsellor about her disclosure to her Stepmother. This was important, because the Complainant had testified that she did tell the Counsellor about the Sofa Incident and that there were “three incidents”.[\[note: 497\]](#Ftn_497) As such, the Complainant may well have been telling the Counsellor about when she had made her disclosure to her Stepmother after the Sofa Incident.

333    Given these deficiencies in the evidence adduced, the Counsellor’s testimony on this point did not affect the Complainant’s credibility.

(B)   Reasons for delayed disclosure not unreasonable

334    The Defence questioned the Complainant’s delay in disclosing the Three Incidents.[\[note: 498\]](#Ftn_498) But, a “victim of sexual assault, especially a youthful one assaulted in a familial context, may not report the offence in a timely manner because there are empirically-supported psychological reasons for delayed reporting”. These reasons include the “fear of not being believed”, the “fear of causing family disruption”, and “not \[wanting\] negative consequences for loved ones when they disclose” (_Mohd Ariffan_ at \[64\]-\[65\]). That there was a delay in reporting by the Complainant was hence not, on its own, a reason to disbelieve the Complainant and her allegations against the accused (_Mohd Ariffan_ at \[66\]). There is no general rule requiring victims of sexual offences (such as the Complainant) to report the offences to the police or anyone else (such as family members) immediately or in a timely fashion. Instead, the Complainant’s explanations for her delay in reporting the offences to others have to be examined to determine the impact of the delay, if any, on her credibility (_Mohd Ariffan_ at \[67\]).

335    On this note, the Complainant explained that she did not inform the Mother of the accused’s actions as she thought that the Mother would not believe her because they were “not close”. She thus thought that it would be best for her to first gain the Mother’s trust and “make \[their\] relationship closer” before she told the Mother anything. I set out the Complainant’s testimony on this aspect:[\[note: 499\]](#Ftn_499)

> Q:    And did you ever inform your mother about these incidents?

> A:    …I plan to tell her but only after…I get her trust because since we are not close, I…thought that if I told her when our relationship is still not close she would not believe me, so I thought that it would be best for me to…make our relationship closer so that she would start to have trust in me so that I can tell her about what happened.

336    The Complainant had further said that she thought that the Mother “would not understand” and get angry with her if she were to ever tell her the truth again.[\[note: 500\]](#Ftn_500)

337    I noted that the Complainant provided these same reasons (and more) when specifically asked why she did not inform the Mother of the accused’s actions during the Bedroom Incident[\[note: 501\]](#Ftn_501) and the Sofa Incident.[^502] The Complainant’s testimony was thus consistent throughout.

338    The Complainant also explained why she did not disclose the accused’s actions to her Father. She said she feared that he would “do something” to, or “confront”, the accused as her Father might not be able to “control his anger” if she informed him of the accused’s actions:[\[note: 503\]](#Ftn_503)

> Q:    And have you ever informed your \[Father\] about these incidents?

> A:    No.

> Q:    Why not?

> A:    Because…afraid if I told him about what happened, he can’t control his anger he might do something…I was afraid that he might not control his anger and would…confront my stepfather.

339    The Complainant agreed that she was close to her paternal grandparents, but explained this was “not to the point where \[she\] would tell them everything”.[\[note: 504\]](#Ftn_504)

340    The Complainant further explained that she did not “file a report” when her Stepmother told her to do so as she wanted to first inform the Mother personally about the accused’s actions. However, she needed to gain the Mother’s trust before informing her as she feared that the Mother would not otherwise believe her.[\[note: 505\]](#Ftn_505) This was also consistent with the Stepmother’s account of the Complainant’s response when she advised the Complainant to report the matter to the police.[^506] In addition, the Complainant explained that she was “scared” and “intimidated” at the thought of having to go to the police station.[^507]

341    I noted that this was also not a case where the Complainant had gone to the NPC on her own initiative on 18 January 2017 to lodge the Report against the accused. It was the Complainant’s unchallenged testimony that the CPOs had brought her to the NPC to do so. It was also the Complainant’s unchallenged testimony that she made the Report because the CPOs had asked her to.[\[note: 508\]](#Ftn_508) The Complainant’s reluctance to report the matter to the police was also evident from the fact that she did nothing at all towards this for almost a week after her disclosure to her Teacher on 11 January 2017.[^509] None of these aspects were suggestive of a person bent on falsely implicating the accused.

342    Indeed, the Complainant had _already_ detailed many of her reasons for not promptly reporting the offences in the Note she wrote nearly 2½ years before she testified.[\[note: 510\]](#Ftn_510) I reproduce the relevant portion of her Note below, for easy reference:

> I did \[think\] about reporting to the police but there are a few consequences that I will have to face:

>> 4)    Nobody will believe me. I am the mischievous child who loves to create trouble and often telling lies whereas my step dad is very religious.

>> 5)    My mom might break her relationship with me. My mom and me are not close. Instead, we are very far apart from each other and she often thinks that I hate her so if I break the news to her, she would prob\[a\]bly say that I want to break her relationship with my step dad.

>> 6)    My dad can’t control his anger so he would prob\[a\]bly beat my step father up very badly and he might go to jail and I can’t bear that because I love him too much.

> and I decided to make my relationship with my mom become closer and let her grow trust in me before breaking the news to her.

343    The Complainant’s reasons for not reporting the offences in a timely manner had thus been consistent throughout – from the time she wrote the Note on 13 January 2017 to the time she testified in July 2019. Against this backdrop and given that the Complainant should not be held to adult standards[\[note: 511\]](#Ftn_511), I was satisfied that the delay in her disclosure and her reluctance to report the matter to the police were based on sound and credible reasons from her perspective (namely, that of a 13/14-year-old child). These reasons were also aligned with the thought-processes and behaviour of many victims of sexual offences (_Mohd Ariffan_ at \[62\]-\[64\] and \[73\]). I therefore found that the Complainant’s delay in disclosing the offences did not undermine her credibility in any way.

##### (5)   Reasonable reasons underlying brevity of police report

344    The Defence took issue with the fact that the Report:[\[note: 512\]](#Ftn_512)

> (a)     was “a one-liner” that “only” stated as follows: “A few months ago, I was molested by my step-father” (“the Phrase”); and

> (b)     referred “only to a singular incident of molest”.

345    In cross-examination, the Complainant appeared to agree that she had given the Phrase to the counter officer at the NPC.[\[note: 513\]](#Ftn_513) As the Report did not state anything further, the Defence contended that a reasonable doubt thus arose from within the Prosecution’s case on the Bedroom Incident.[^514] But, the Complainant never testified that the Phrase referred to the Bedroom Incident only and not to the Master Bedroom Incident or the Sofa Incident (which the Complainant understood to involve an instance of molest as well[^515]). In any event, I did not find the Defence’s submission persuasive for at least two reasons.

346     First, it is a misconception to regard the Report, a first information report (the “FIR”), as a document which should contain the entire case for the Prosecution. This is because the main purpose of a FIR is “merely to give information of a cognisable offence to the police so as to set them in motion”. The form of the FIR merely requires an informant to provide brief details and clearly does not contemplate that the informant should give elaborate details of the alleged offences (_Tan Pin Seng v PP_[\[note: 516\]](#Ftn_516) (“_Tan Pin Seng_”)).

347     Second, the Complainant did not have any role to play in typing down the information reflected in the Report (including the line under “Brief details”). All the information reflected in the Report was, in fact, typed down by the “counter officer” at the NPC who had attended to the Complainant on 18 January 2017.[\[note: 517\]](#Ftn_517) On this note, it was IO Isak’s unchallenged testimony that the police classify cases involving minors and sexual offences (such as the Complainant’s) as “sensitive”. This classification led to the automatic redaction of certain details in the Report that related to the Complainant because these details concerned information that the police “\[did not\] want others to know”. The nature of the Complainant’s case also meant that the “counter officer \[would\] not \[have\] put in everything” the Complainant told him when filling in the “Brief details” section of the Report. Instead, the counter officer had to be “as brief as possible”. According to IO Isak, the information reflected in the “Brief details” section of the Report had to be put “as minimal as possible” to prevent others (including other police officers) from knowing too much about the Complainant’s case. The full facts of the case would, however, be detailed in the statement that would be recorded later.[^518] In this regard, the Complainant had testified that she _did_ provide the details of the alleged offences to the “investigating officer” (_viz_, IO Isak, who had recorded her statement on the same day that the Report was made[^519]):[^520]

> Q:    So, the first time you ever spoke about the collar pulling incident is to your \[Teacher\]. Or who did you first talk to \[about this incident\]?

> A:    Um, the investigating officer.

> …

> Q:    …You see, before going to the police station, you already know that the counsellor is calling for Child Protection Services, and you are going to go to the police station. Why didn’t you write the details of the molest in the \[Report\]?

> A:     **I did told the investigating officer.**

> Q:    No…I’m not asking you what you have told the investigator officer. I’m asking, why didn’t you give details \[in the Report\]?

> A:     **I did---I just told what happened, but I didn’t write it down.**

> Q:    Say, “I was molested by my stepfather” but never say number of occasion, when, what time.

> A:     **Because when I reached \[the NPC\], I was just told to tell about what happened**, they didn’t tell me to write down about a brief description.

> …

> Q:    Why didn’t you give more details?

> A:     **I did give more details.**

> Q:    Not in the \[Report\], confirm that.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    But \[to\] the subsequent police officer.

> A:    To the same---**on the day itself when I went to the \[NPC\] to file a report. That’s when I told over all the incidents.**

> Q:    Yah, but…not while doing the \[Report\]. It’s thereafter.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Correct?

> A:    Yes.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

##### (6)   No adverse inferences drawn against Prosecution

348    The Defence invited the court to draw adverse inferences against the Prosecution under illustration (_g_) to s 116 of the Evidence Act for not presenting:[\[note: 521\]](#Ftn_521)

> (a)     “the \[Helper’s\] evidence as she was the only \[other\] adult…present \[in the Flat\] during the alleged offences \[in 2016\] and was available for questioning when the \[Complainant\] lodged \[the Report\] on 18 January 2017”. It was not disputed that the Helper was not interviewed by the police. It was also not disputed that the accused and the Mother had allowed the Helper to leave Singapore sometime in March 2017. Both the accused and the Mother testified that the Helper was allowed to leave as she had requested to “end her contract early” to sort out some family issues in her home country. The accused also testified that there was no longer a need for the Helper as the Complainant was not staying with the Mother and him anymore.[\[note: 522\]](#Ftn_522) The Defence contended that the Helper’s “evidence would have been potentially helpful and instrumental”.[^523]

> (b)     the closed-circuit television camera (“CCTV”) footage “that was available at the time of reporting of the offences…despite knowing that there was \[a CCTV camera\] installed in the \[Flat\]”. It was not disputed that there was a CCTV camera installed in the Flat at the time of the alleged offences in 2016. This camera was placed on a bookshelf in the living room, next to the kitchen.[\[note: 524\]](#Ftn_524) The following aspects of the Mother’s testimony were also not disputed:[^525]

>> (i)       The CCTV camera was installed to monitor the movements of the Helper and the Complainant.

>> (ii)       The CCTV camera was operated using a mobile application. It could be rotated, remotely, to “pan out from the dining \[area in the kitchen\] all the way to the hallway leading to the \[bed\]rooms”.

>> (iii)       The Mother would “only” view the footage captured by the CCTV camera when the Helper was alone in the Flat. The Mother would do this “maybe once a week”.

>> (iv)       The data stored in the CCTV camera would be stored “for about a week” before it would be overridden by fresh data.

>> (v)       The accused was aware of the CCTV camera.

>> (vi)       The police knew of the CCTV camera on or after 18 January 2017. No footage was seized from this camera.

349    Illustration (_g_) to s 116 of the Evidence Act reads as follows:

> **Court may presume existence of certain fact**

> **116.**     The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.

> …

_Illustrations_

> The court may presume —

>> …

>> (_g_)    that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.

350    Illustration (_g_) to s 116 of the Evidence Act assumes that such evidence, “which could be and is not produced”, is “material to the case and that it can be produced without inordinate difficulty”. This illustration has “often been held to be applicable where a party _unreasonably_ omits to call a witness or to adduce other material evidence. However, even though a person may have been able to shed some light on the circumstances of the case, the failure to call \[that person\] as a witness does not necessarily mean that the court will draw an adverse inference. The evidence that the person would give as a witness ought to have potential significance before the court determines that an adverse inference should be drawn against the party who _unjustifiably_ failed to call him.”[\[note: 526\]](#Ftn_526)

351    The relevant principles, in the context of absent witnesses, were summarised in _Sudha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd_ (“_Sudha_”) at \[20\][\[note: 527\]](#Ftn_527):

> (a)     **In certain circumstances the court may be entitled to draw adverse inferences from the absence** or silence **of a witness who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in the matter before it.**

> (b)    If the court is willing to draw such inferences, these may go to strengthen the evidence adduced on that issue by the other party or to weaken the evidence, if any, adduced by the party who might reasonably have been expected to call the witness.

> (c)     **There must, however, have been some evidence, even if weak, which was adduced by the party seeking to draw the inference, on the issue in question, before the court would be entitled to draw the desired inference**: in other words, **there must be a case to answer on that issue which is then strengthened by the drawing of the inference.**

> (d)     **If the reason for the witness’s absence** or silence **can be explained to the satisfaction of the court, then no adverse inference may be drawn**. **If, on the other hand, a reasonable and credible explanation is given, even if it is not wholly satisfactory, the potentially detrimental effect of his/her absence** or silence **may be reduced or annulled.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

352    The following principles, which are applicable to the drawing of adverse inferences generally, also bear mention (_Nabill_ at \[74\], referring to _Sudha_ at \[21\], \[23\], and \[26\]):

> (a)    first, an **adverse inference ought not to be drawn where the failure to produce evidence is reasonably attributable to reasons other than the merits of the case \[or the issue in question\]**;

> (b)    second, in drawing the relevant inference, the court must put its mind to the _manner_ in which the evidence that is not produced is said to be unfavourable to the party who might reasonably have been expected to produce it; and

> (c)    third, applying the best evidence rule, an adverse inference should not be drawn unless it can be said that the evidence that is withheld is superior to the evidence already adduced.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

353    I declined to draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for not calling the Helper as a witness. It was not disputed that the Helper was not in Singapore at the time the Defence closed its case after the Mother’s re-examination. There was also no clear evidence as to the Helper’s current whereabouts. This was therefore not a case where the Prosecution could have called the Helper as a witness, without inordinate difficulty, but elected not to call her. There was thus no basis for the Defence to allege that the Prosecution had _unreasonably_ omitted to call the Helper as a witness.[\[note: 528\]](#Ftn_528) Any alleged failure on the part of the Prosecution to call the Helper as a witness was reasonably attributable to reasons other than the merits of the case.[^529]

354    In any event, the Helper’s testimony was not material to the Prosecution’s case, which hinged on the Complainant’s testimony. The Helper might have been able to shed some light on the circumstances of the case. But, the potential significance/materiality of her testimony was unclear. This was in light of the Complainant’s testimony that:[\[note: 530\]](#Ftn_530)

> (a)     the Helper _never_ saw the Three Incidents because the Helper was:

>> (i)       in her own bedroom, with the door closed/locked, at the time of the Bedroom Incident in the Complainant’s bedroom.

>> (ii)       in her own bedroom at the time of the Sofa Incident in the living room.

>> (iii)       in the kitchen just before the Master Bedroom Incident (and the Complainant was not sure if the Helper had walked past the master bedroom during this incident (since the door to the master bedroom had only been “slightly opened” at this time)).

> (b)     she had not made any noise (such as to scream/shout to the Helper for help) or tried to run away during the Bedroom Incident because she was “scared” that the accused would do something worse to her if she did.

> (c)     in relation to the Master Bedroom Incident:

>> (i)       she had not shouted to the Helper for help while the accused was pulling her into the master bedroom because she was scared.

>> (ii)       she had not shouted to the Helper for help while the accused was molesting her in the master bedroom because she was “scared” he would do something worse to her if she did.

> (d)     in relation to the Sofa Incident, she had not reacted when the accused suddenly pulled the neckline of her T-shirt and looked inside her T-shirt as she was shocked by his actions and was also scared of him.

355    The mere fact that the Helper was somewhere in the Flat at the time of the Three Incidents was hence neither relevant nor material, given the Complainant’s testimony, to the key issue of whether the Three Incidents had, in fact, happened.

356    In addition, the accused had never mentioned _how_ the Helper’s account was possibly, and specifically, relevant to any of the Three Incidents in his statements to the police. In his investigation statement dated 18 January 2017[\[note: 531\]](#Ftn_531) (_viz_, before the Helper left Singapore in March 2017), his only reference to the Helper was in the opening paragraph – where he stated that he had been “staying at the \[Flat\] for about 5 years together with \[his\] wife, one son, one step daughter and one maid”. The accused did refer to a massage he had performed on the Complainant’s back while she was lying on her bed in her bedroom sometime in 2016, but there was otherwise no mention of the Helper, at all, in relation to this massage/incident. Against this backdrop, it was difficult to see any force in the Defence’s contention that the police should have done the following on or around 18 January 2017:[^532]

> (a)     inform the accused or the Mother “not to send the \[Helper\] home until investigations are complete\[d\]” or before the accused’s case ended.

> (b)     exercise its powers under the Criminal Procedure Code[\[note: 533\]](#Ftn_533) “to keep \[the Helper\] in Singapore until the trial” or to testify in a possible trial.

357    In his subsequent investigation statement dated 25 April 2017[\[note: 534\]](#Ftn_534) (_viz_, after the Helper had left Singapore in March 2017), the accused had stated that he would massage the Complainant’s back “whenever she complained of backache or strain on the shoulder blade”. He also stated that these massages would “take place at times in the living room or at times in \[the Complainant’s\] bedroom” and that \[a\]ll of \[these\] massages took place \[in 2016\] whenever \[his\] son…and \[the Helper were\] at home and \[his\] wife \[was\] away at work, or…in school”.[^535] On this note, the accused had specifically referred to the Bedroom Incident in his statement.[^536] But, there was no mention of _how_ the Helper was specifically relevant to this incident in the Complainant’s bedroom (apart from his earlier statement that the Helper was “at home” whenever he massaged the Complainant). The accused had also referred to the Sofa Incident in his statement.[^537] But, there was, again, no mention of _how_ the Helper was specifically relevant to this incident.

358    The accused had also not referred to the Helper in any of his cautioned statements that were recorded on 20 June 2018.[\[note: 538\]](#Ftn_538)

359    Further, the Defence never questioned IO Isak on why the Helper was not interviewed during investigations. The earliest the Prosecution was possibly made aware of the potential (and, arguably, peripheral) relevance of the Helper was during the accused’s examination-in-chief on 11 July 2019 (_viz_, more than two years after the Helper left Singapore in March 2017). There, the accused had testified that had he locked the main door of the Flat before the Bedroom Incident, the Helper “would have come out from the \[Helper’s\] \[bed\]room” as the Helper was waiting for the Mother to return home.[\[note: 539\]](#Ftn_539) The _specific_ relevance of the Helper to the Bedroom Incident was nonetheless unclear even at this point.

360    Indeed, the potential relevance of the Helper’s testimony was only made clear, belatedly, during the Mother’s testimony in August 2019 – about 2½ years after the Helper had left Singapore in March 2017. There, the Mother had testified that the Helper would “only go to bed” when the Helper was “confident” that the Complainant was already in bed. According to the Mother, this was because the Complainant, the Helper, and the pet cat shared the common toilet. As such, the Helper would “put the cat in the \[common\] toilet” and “ensure that everything \[was\] locked” before she would “lock her room door and sleep”.[\[note: 540\]](#Ftn_540) The Mother’s testimony in this regard appeared to contradict the Complainant’s testimony in relation to the Bedroom Incident[^541] on the _limited_ point of whether the Helper had also locked, as opposed to only having closed, the door to her bedroom during the Bedroom Incident. But, this account in the Mother’s testimony was never put to the Complainant when she testified. It was not even raised by the accused.

361    I therefore had some doubts as to whether the Helper could be considered a “material witness” in this case – _viz_, a witness who could be expected to confirm or, conversely, contradict the accused’s defence in material respects (_Nabill_ at \[4\]). That said, even if the Helper was a “material witness” in this case, this was not a situation where the accused had advanced a specific defence, which identified the Helper as a specific material witness, and the Prosecution, despite having had access to the Helper as a witness, had chosen not to call her (_Nabill_ at \[70\]). Simply put, the Prosecution did not have any access to the Helper during the trial. This was therefore not a case where the Prosecution could even have chosen not to the call the Helper as a witness. Indeed, the Prosecution was not even in possession of a statement from the Helper (_Nabill_ at \[73\]). There was therefore no basis to justify an inference being drawn against the Prosecution that the Helper’s evidence, if led, would have been adverse to the Prosecution on the fact of whether the Three Incidents had indeed happened.

362    I also declined to draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for not “present\[ing\]” CCTV footage during the trial. Indeed, it was not disputed that the Prosecution did not even have any such footage in its possession to begin with. This was therefore not a case where the Prosecution could have, but did not, produce such footage.[\[note: 542\]](#Ftn_542)

363    In any event, the potential significance/materiality of such CCTV footage was also unclear – in light of:

> (a)     the Complainant’s testimony that the Three Incidents had all happened in 2016 (and not in 2017).

> (b)     my findings that:

>> (i)       the Sofa Incident (the last of the Three Incidents) had happened sometime in 2016, before the Complainant’s 14th birthday on 21 December 2016.

>> (ii)       there was no “triggering incident” on 10 January 2017.

> (c)     the Mother’s testimony that the data in the CCTV camera would be stored for only “about a week” before it would be overridden by fresh data.

364    As such, even if the police had known of the existence of the CCTV camera in the Flat on 18 January 2017, any _relevant_ footage that was stored in this camera would have been overridden by then.

365    Indeed, the potential relevance of such CCTV footage only materialised, belatedly, when the Mother testified in August 2019 – _viz_, more than 2½ years after the Report was lodged in January 2017. Had such footage been relevant in exonerating the accused, the Defence should have questioned IO Isak on why such footage was not seized during investigations. But, even the existence of a CCTV camera in the Flat was not brought up by the Defence during its cross-examination of IO Isak (let alone the existence of any footage from such a camera). The accused also did not mention anything about the existence of a CCTV camera in the Flat or the availability of footage from such a camera when he testified. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that the irresistible inference arising from the Mother’s “sudden revelation \[in August 2019\] of the existence \[of\] possible CCTV footage \[which came\] about a month” after the accused had testified in July 2019, and after IO Isak had also testified, was that this “revelation” was an afterthought.[\[note: 543\]](#Ftn_543)

##### (7)   No merit to Defence’s allegations _vis-à-vis_ investigations

366    As mentioned,[\[note: 544\]](#Ftn_544) Counsel’s further reply submissions contained several allegations relating to the conduct of police investigations into the accused’s case. These submissions also contained allegations about the conduct of the Prosecution.

367    Counsel broadly contended that the “alleged offences were not investigated with due or any diligence”.[\[note: 545\]](#Ftn_545) As such, she averred there would be “grave prejudice and a severe miscarriage of justice” if the accused was “convicted based on the Prosecution’s case” given the “missing links and lack of diligent investigations”.[^546] More specifically, Counsel’s submissions set out the following allegations:

> (a)     The “evidence of the \[Helper and\] the CCTV \[footage\] would have cleared the air on many material issues”. The failure of the police to secure either aspect “cannot be tolerated and amount to laxity, to say the least”.[\[note: 547\]](#Ftn_547) In relation to the Helper, Counsel additionally submitted that it was “for the Prosecution’s investigative arm to exercise due diligence” to make available the Helper, who was a material witness, to the Prosecution. Counsel also asserted that the police could have informed the accused or the Mother not to send the Helper home until investigations were complete. Counsel further sought to “gently remind the Prosecution that the police \[had\] powers to keep the \[Helper\] in Singapore \[for\] the trial.[^548]

> (b)     The Prosecution had called only IO Isak to testify, “for reasons best known to \[it\]”. IO Isak had investigated only the Bedroom Incident. The “actual Investigating Officer” was Investigation Officer Muhammad Faizal (“IO Faizal”), who the Prosecution failed to call to testify. IO Faizal (who had recorded the accused’s second investigation statement[\[note: 549\]](#Ftn_549)) was “put out of \[the\] Defence’s reach” and the Defence was not able to question him about the Helper and the CCTV camera/footage. The “appropriate inference” should therefore be drawn, “especially since \[the charges relating to the Master Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident\] sprung into existence \[only\] after IO Faizal’s involvement.”[^550]

> (c)     The Prosecution failed to “obtain and preserve the mobile phones of \[the Complainant\] and \[her Stepmother\]”. Had these phones been obtained on or soon after 18 January 2017, the fact of when the Complainant had made her disclosure to her Stepmother “could have been easily established”. “If the Defence witnesses, being laypersons \[could\] diligently preserve important evidence pertaining to the \[Defence’s\] case, \[it was\] \[in\]tolerable that trained police investigators \[were\] so lackadaisical in their efforts to procure and preserve” the contents in the mobile phones belonging to the Complainant and her Stepmother”. It was puzzling “why the Prosecution \[had\] omitted to adduce \[such evidence\]”, which would have secured either the accused’s conviction or acquittal.[\[note: 551\]](#Ftn_551)

> (d)     The investigation officers did not visit the Flat, the scene of the alleged offences.[\[note: 552\]](#Ftn_552)

368    There was no merit in the Defence’s submissions for adverse inferences to be drawn against the Prosecution in relation to the Helper and the CCTV camera/footage.[\[note: 553\]](#Ftn_553) Counsel’s allegations in this regard[^554] had no merit as well.

369    I agreed with the Prosecution that Counsel’s allegation that IO Faizal was “put out of \[the\] Defence’s reach”[\[note: 555\]](#Ftn_555) bordered on “insinuating _mala fides_” on the Prosecution’s part.[^556] Counsel had based her contention that IO Faizal was the “actual Investigating Officer” on the following aspect of the Mother’s testimony:[^557]

> Q:    Did the police know about this CCTV \[camera\] that you had?

> A:    Yes, I did mention about this.

> Q:    Did they come to check or retrieve any footage?

> A:    From \[IO Isak\]---from what I understand from \[IO Isak\], he is not the---he is not the investigating officer. According to \[IO Isak\], he’s just there to take my report---I mean my statement. So, there should be his colleague that will come down to do---uh, another set of interview 1 or 2 weeks later.

> Q:    Did that happen?

> A:    No, it didn’t.

370    But, at no point did the Defence put it to IO Isak that he:

> (a)     was “not the investigating officer”; and

> (b)     had told the Mother that:

>> (i)       he was “just there” to take her statement; and

>> (ii)       his “colleague” would “come down to do…another set of interview 1 or 2 weeks later”.

371    Indeed, _none_ of the other allegations in Counsel’s further reply submissions[\[note: 558\]](#Ftn_558) were ever put to IO Isak by the Defence. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that the allegations in Counsel’s submissions were afterthoughts.[^559] I also agreed with the Prosecution that this was not a case where IO Faizal had been “put out of \[the\] Defence’s reach” by the Prosecution. In this regard, I accepted the following aspect of the Prosecution’s submissions (which also would have applied in relation to the calling of the Helper as a Defence witness):[^560]

> …\[I\]t is trite that there is no property in a witness, and it was entirely open to the Defence to call IO Faizal as a Defence witness or apply to summon him to give evidence. It bears highlighting that the accused’s charges were subject to the criminal case disclosure procedures…encapsulated under…the Criminal Procedure Code…(“CPC”). Per s 162(1) of the CPC, the Case for the Prosecution (“CFP”) must contain a list of the names of the witnesses for the prosecution. The CFP was filed and served on 7 December 2018. Accordingly, as early as December 2018, the Defence was made aware that the Prosecution did not intend to call IO Faizal as part of its case, and only intended to call…IO Isak. If the Defence so wished to call IO Faizal as a witness or had been seriously desirous of cross-examining him, it was entirely open to the Defence to call IO Faizal: see _Public Prosecutor v Abdul Nasir bin Abdul Rahim_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 49</span> at \[47\]; or apply under s 283 of the CPC to summon IO Faizal to give evidence: see _Sarjit Singh Rapati v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 638</span> at \[37\]. The fact of the matter is that the Defence did none of these things. The Prosecution…therefore cannot be faulted for not calling IO Faizal…

372    There was also no merit in Counsel’s allegation that the police had failed to “obtain and preserve” the text messages between the Complainant and her Stepmother relating to the Complainant’s disclosure.[\[note: 561\]](#Ftn_561) IO Isak was never questioned on why these messages were not retrieved.[^562] There was also no evidence before the court to suggest that the Complainant had informed the police of the existence of these text messages (and, on this note, the Complainant had testified that she could not remember how she had informed her Stepmother that she was molested by the accused[^563]). In addition, the Stepmother had testified that she had not informed the police of the existence of these text messages (when she went down to the NPC on 18 January 2017) before these messages were lost when she changed her phone a few months after the first week of January 2017.[^564] There was therefore no bass to fault the police for failing to “procure and preserve” these text messages when the very existence of these messages was ever known to the police at the material time. In a similar vein, there was no merit in Counsel’s allegation that the Prosecution had “omitted to adduce” these text messages (given that the Prosecution did not even have these messages in the first place to adduce).

373    Counsel’s allegation as to the lack of a scene visit[\[note: 565\]](#Ftn_565) also had no merit. Leaving aside the fact that the Defence never questioned IO Isak on _why_ such a visit was not done[^566], Counsel also never explained _how_ such a visit might have been relevant in this case. As the Prosecution correctly noted:[^567]

> (a)     This was a case of “delayed reporting, \[and\] there was no urgency to retrieve highly perishable DNA evidence at the Flat”.

> (b)     The “accused never pleaded a defence of physical impossibility of the offending acts in his statements. On the contrary, \[he\] acknowledge\[d\] that he had massaged \[the Complainant\] in her bedroom. Accordingly, this was not a case where detailed sketch plans and/or…photographs had to \[prepared or obtained\] to debunk or confirm the accused’s defence.”

#### No reasonable doubt had arisen on the totality of the evidence

374    A reasonable doubt may also arise on assessing the totality of the evidence. The inquiry at this stage is intimately connected with the “unusually convincing” standard, which arises in the context of mutually exclusive and competing testimonies. The “unusually convincing” standard sets the threshold for a witness’s evidence (the Complainant’s, in this case) to be preferred over that advanced by the accused, where it is a case of one person’s word against another’s. The evaluative task, here, is not just internal to the Prosecution’s case. It is also comparative in nature. In assessing the totality of the evidence, regard may be had to the weaknesses in the case mounted by the accused (as a matter of the assertions he has advanced and the evidence he has adduced (_GCK_ at \[143\]-\[144\])).

375    There were several inconsistencies in the case mounted by the accused. Parts of his statements not only contradicted his testimony, but turned out to be consistent with the Complainant’s evidence instead. Many aspects of the Complainant’s testimony were not challenged by the Defence when the Complainant testified. But, many contrary assertions were made by the accused and the Mother during their subsequent testimonies. The belated nature of these assertions suggested that many facets of the accused’s case were afterthoughts and should not be believed. Various claims were also made in Counsel’s submissions, that were neither relatable to, or supported by, the evidence adduced, to explain away the deficiencies in the case mounted by the accused. To my mind, a reasoned doubt did not exist to justify an acquittal on any of the charges.[\[note: 568\]](#Ftn_568)

##### (1)   Inconsistencies _vis-à-vis_ massages before Bedroom Incident

376    In examination-in-chief, the Complainant testified that the accused had massaged her a “few times” on the “couch” in the living room before the Bedroom Incident.[\[note: 569\]](#Ftn_569) In cross-examination, she estimated that he had massaged her “around 5” times before the Bedroom Incident.[^570] She was consistent in describing how he had massaged her on these previous occasions. She was also consistent that these massages “always happened” when the Mother was at work; when her Stepbrother was “sleeping”; and when the Helper was “already in her room” (or “sleeping”). Indeed, she had also written about these “few” massages before the Bedroom Incident in her Note of 13 January 2017 (_viz_, about 2½ years before she testified):[^571]

> There is one thing that has been bothering me a lot lately – my stepfather. He has been my stepfather since I was in secondary school and I have always seen him as the kind, religious man but ever since I stayed at my mom’s house for my secondary life, my view towards him changed. **It all started** **when my mom got too carried \[away\] with her work** **and my muscles \[were\] killing me. It was** **night time** **and** **my maid and my little brother \[were\] asleep, leaving me alone together with my stepdad****. He seem\[ed\] to notice my pain in the backbone and he ask\[ed\] if I wanted a massage. My step-dad and I aren’t close so I didn’t know how to politely reject him so I agreed to his offer. The** **first massage** **wasn’t so touchy, he only massage\[d\] my backbone and I thought that he \[had\] no intention to do anything wrong so** **I agreed to his offer whenever he offer\[ed\] me a massage****. But after** **a few massages****, I beg\[a\]n to notice that he beg\[a\]n to be a little more touchy and secretive and I realise\[d\] that** **he doesn’t massage \[me\] whenever my mom is around**.

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

377    The accused later testified that he had only massaged the Complainant a total of four times.[\[note: 572\]](#Ftn_572) The Mother also testified that “\[t\]here were 4” massages to the best of her recollection.[^573] According to the accused, the second of these four massages was a massage he had performed on the Complainant in relation to the alleged Bedroom Incident.[^574] This necessarily meant that his position was that he had massaged the Complainant on only _one_ occasion before the alleged Bedroom Incident. This was _very_ different from the “few” or “around 5” massages the Complainant had alleged he had performed on her before the Bedroom Incident. But, the Defence did not challenge _any_ aspect of the Complainant’s testimony on these previous massages when she testified (including her testimony on the number of massages the accused had performed on her before the Bedroom Incident).

378    Pressed on his failure to challenge the Complainant’s testimony in this regard, the accused became uneasy and claimed that he “didn’t know” he could challenge her testimony (although he said he knew she was supposedly also lying about this fact during her testimony). However, he also confirmed, immediately after, that it had been on his instructions that the Defence had put it to the Complainant that she was lying about the Three Incidents.[\[note: 575\]](#Ftn_575) This contradicted his initial claim that he did not know he could challenge the Complainant’s testimony if she was lying. Pressed further, he tried to change the topic and brush aside the Prosecution’s suggestion that he had not challenged the Complainant’s testimony because it was in fact true (that he had massaged her on a few occasions before the Bedroom Incident when nobody else was present). I had observed the accused closely as he testified. It was clear that he was caught out when the Prosecution confronted him on this point. I set out his testimony:[^576]

Q:

 | 

Now, you have heard \[the Complainant\] give evidence that prior to the massage in her bedroom…you had massaged her around 5 times in the living room…You---…heard her give the evidence?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And according to you, this is untrue, isn’t it?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And when you heard her give the evidence, at that point, you knew that it was untrue, isn’t it?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

However, you didn’t confront her about this lie when she was on the witness stand, did you?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Even though you knew that she was blatantly lying here in Court, isn’t it?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And if it was so important to you, you would have challenged \[her\] evidence, isn’t it?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

I respected the Court. I didn’t know I can do that.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

You didn’t know that you could challenge \[the Complainant’s\] evidence in Court, is that what you are saying?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So when your lawyer put \[it\] to \[the Complainant\] that she was lying, what did you imagine your lawyer was doing?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Disputing.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

He was challenging her evidence, wasn’t he?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

He was telling her that she was lying, wasn’t he?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And these were on your instructions, wasn’t it? You had told your lawyer that this is untrue and you should challenge \[the Complainant’s\] evidence in Court, isn’t it?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

But---

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

you didn’t do the same for these 5 \[previous\] massages, did you?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And the reason why you didn’t do that \[was\] because \[the Complainant’s\] evidence is true, isn’t it?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

She mentioned black sofa, right?

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

She mentioned that she wa---she was massaged 5 times prior---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Alright, just answer the questions.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

\[S\]he mentioned that she was massaged 5 times prior to the incident in the bedroom. And you didn’t challenge this evidence, did you?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And the reason why you didn’t challenge this evidence is because it is true, isn’t it?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No.

379    The accused’s failure to challenge the Complainant’s testimony on the number of occasions he had massaged her before the Bedroom Incident was even more glaring on closer analysis of her testimony. The Complainant had testified (and stated in her Note as well) that the Mother; the Helper; and her Stepbrother were all absent during the “few” occasions the accused had massaged her before the Bedroom Incident (_ie_, no one was present when the accused massaged her on all these occasions before the Bedroom Incident). Her testimony therefore meant that the “demonstration” massage, which the accused and the Mother claimed was the first time the accused had ever massaged the Complainant[\[note: 577\]](#Ftn_577), could not have been one of the “few” massages the accused had performed on the Complainant before the Bedroom Incident. This was because the accused and the Mother had both testified that the Mother was present during this “demonstration” massage. The Mother had even testified that the Helper and their son were also present during this “demonstration” massage. But, if the “demonstration” massage, the only massage the accused claimed he had performed on the Complainant before the Bedroom Incident was not one of the “few” massages he had performed on her before the Bedroom Incident (which was the effect of the Complainant’s testimony), this meant that the Complainant had thus lied about _all_ of the “few” massages she claimed the accused had performed on her before the Bedroom Incident. However, the Defence never challenged the Complainant’s testimony on any aspect of these “few” previous massages when the Complainant testified.[^578]

380    Against this backdrop, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Complainant’s testimony should be preferred over that advanced by the accused.[\[note: 579\]](#Ftn_579) In other words, I accepted the Complainant’s evidence that:

> (a)     the accused had massaged her on a “few” (or “around 5”) occasions on the “couch” in the living room before the Bedroom Incident.

> (b)     no one else – including the Mother; the Helper; and the Stepbrother – had been present during these previous massages. In particular, the Mother was not in the Flat on all the occasions the accused had performed these previous massages on her.

381    My acceptance of the Complainant’s evidence on these aspects necessarily meant that I rejected:

> (a)     the accused’s testimony in relation to the “demonstration” massage The accused had claimed that this “demonstration” massage was the first time he had ever massaged the Complainant. It was also his position that his “demonstration” massage on the Complainant had happened in the Mother’s presence and before the Bedroom Incident (which he claimed was the second time he had ever massaged the Complainant). I rejected the accused’s testimony in relation to the “demonstration” massage (which could not have been one of the “few” massages he had performed on the Complainant before the Bedroom Incident[\[note: 580\]](#Ftn_580)) because, _if_ the accused had indeed massaged the Complainant in the Mother’s absence on a “few” occasions before the Bedroom Incident (as was the Complainant’s testimony), he could not have _also_ performed the “demonstration” massage on the Complainant in the Mother’s presence at any time before the Bedroom Incident. This flowed from the fact that it was never the Complainant’s evidence or the accused’s case that he had _also_ massaged the Complainant in the Mother’s presence before the Bedroom Incident (that is, _in addition_ to the “few” massages the Complainant said he performed on her in the Mother’s absence before the Bedroom Incident).

> (b)     the Mother’s testimony on two aspects: one, in relation to the accused’s demonstration massage; and, two, in relation to the accused’s massage of the Complainant at the dining area.[\[note: 581\]](#Ftn_581) The Mother had testified that these two massages had been the first and second time the accused had ever massaged the Complainant before the Bedroom Incident. She also testified that the accused’s demonstration massage was done in her presence; and that the accused’s massage of the Complainant at the dining area had happened while she was in the master bedroom and that she had then walked out of the master bedroom to ask the Complainant about how the accused’s massage had been. I rejected the Mother’s testimony on these two massages (which could not have been one of the “few” massages the accused had performed on the Complainant before the Bedroom Incident[^582]) because, _if_ the accused had indeed massaged the Complainant when the Mother was out at work on a “few” occasions before the Bedroom Incident (as was the Complainant’s testimony), he could not have _also_ performed these two massages on the Complainant in the Mother’s presence[^583] or when the Mother was in the Flat[^584] at any time before the Bedroom Incident. This flowed from the fact that it was never the Complainant’s evidence or the accused’s case that the accused had _also_ massaged the Complainant in the Mother’s presence or when the Mother was in the Flat before the Bedroom Incident (that is, _in addition_ to the “few” massages the Complainant said he performed on her in the Mother’s absence before the Bedroom Incident).

##### (2)   Issues _vis-à-vis_ testimonies on four alleged massages

382    In any event, there were a several deficiencies in the testimonies of the accused and the Mother in relation to the massages they claimed the accused had performed on the Complainant. First, while the accused and the Mother (eventually) testified that the accused had massaged the Complainant on only four occasions, neither initially appeared to be certain of this.[\[note: 585\]](#Ftn_585)

383     Second, save for the massage relating to the Bedroom Incident, the remaining three massages were never raised by the Defence during the Complainant’s testimony. The occurrence of these three massages were raised only when the accused and the Mother testified. Indeed, the accused did not even raise anything specific in relation to these three massages (as he did when he testified) in his statements that were recorded from him, much earlier, on 18 January 2017[\[note: 586\]](#Ftn_586) and 25 April 2017.[^587] In fact, he stated in his latter statement that he could not even remember the number of times he had massaged the Complainant:

> 9    Normally I massage \[the Complainant’s\] back whenever she complained of backache or strain on her shoulder blade. I usually use my elbow to rub against her back, I also massaged her outer thighs with my elbow to assist her releasing the pain from the back…The massages take place at times in the living room or at times in her bedroom. The massage will usually took place after Maghrib prayers or after Isyak prayers which is usually about 7 plus pm and 8 plus pm. All of the massages took place whenever my son…5 years old and my Indonesian helper…are at home and wife will be away at work, or she is in school. **I could not remember how many times I massage \[the Complainant\].** **Probably the frequency is about two or three months once.**[^588] All of the massages took place last year and it was requested by her…

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

384    This meant that the accused’s memory had somehow improved so remarkably after January/April 2017 (when his statements were recorded), that he was able to distinctly recall, in July 2019 (when he testified), details such as:[\[note: 589\]](#Ftn_589)

> (a)     the number of times he had massaged the Complainant in 2016;

> (b)     the order in which he had performed these massages;

> (c)     the precise date on which he had gone for a sports massage (which led to his “demonstration” massage);

> (d)     his exchange with the Complainant before the Bedroom Incident;

> (e)     whether the Complainant was sitting down or standing up when he massaged her; and

> (f)     where his son stood when he was massaging the Complainant.

385    But, the accused struggled to explain why he failed to mention these three other massages in his statement (which was recorded much closer in time to these alleged massages, when his memory of these massages would have been fresher):[\[note: 590\]](#Ftn_590)

> Q:    Now, if you look at paragraph 9 \[of your statement dated 25 April 2017\] … “I could not remember exactly how many times I massaged \[the Complainant\].” And this statement was given on 25th of April 2017, isn’t it?

> A:    Yes.

> …

> Q:    The massages took place in 2016, am I right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    It is now 2019, am I right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And you gave this statement in 2017, am I right?

> A:    Yes.

> …

> **Q:**      **…And so, your memory would have been better about the incidents in \[2016\], am I right?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **But at that point \[in time when your statement was recorded in April 2017), you could not remember exactly how many times you had massage\[d\] \[the Complainant\], isn’t \[it\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **…But now, not only are you able to say how many times you have massaged her, you are able to give the order, and you are able to give specific details of these incidents, isn’t it?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And these incidents \[in 2016\] would have been much fresher in your memory in 2017 \[when your statement was recorded\], wouldn’t it?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    And so…if you look at paragraph 9 of your statement, you said, “The massages…take place at times in the living room, or at times in her bedroom. You confirm that this is what is…in your statement?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **No mention \[of the massage\] at the dining table?** [^591]

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **No mention about \[whether you or the Complainant were\] standing or sitting?** [^592]

> A:    I mention verbally.[^593]

> Q:    But it’s not in your statement\[.\]

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> …

> Q:    So, at that time when you recorded your statement \[in April 2017\], you couldn’t remember exactly where the massages took place, isn’t it?

> A:    I could remember.

> Q:    It says, “At times in the living room, or at times in the bedroom”, am I right?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **If you could recall specifically, you would have said, “1 time in the bedroom; 2 times in the living room; 1 time in the kitchen”, am I right?**

> **A:**      **At that time, I couldn’t recall.**

> Q:    And so, the mere fact that at that time, you couldn’t recall. So you confirm, at that time, you couldn’t recall, am I right?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **But now, not only are you able to recall how many times, you can recall exactly what happened during that time, am I right?”**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> Q:    And this is because your evidence in Court is a fabrication, isn’t it?

> A:    No.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

386    Pressed to explain the remarkable improvement in his memory, the accused claimed that he did not “have time to recall \[his\] whole account” when he was “called” to give this second statement. He also claimed that he “didn’t know what to expect” when his second statement was recorded from him. He further claimed that he “had such short time” to give this statement. In re-examination, he claimed that he was in a “state of shock” and “confused” when his second statement was recorded from him. He also said he “didn’t really have the time and space to actually \[re\]collect back each event”.[\[note: 594\]](#Ftn_594)

387    There was no merit to any of these assertions. The accused’s second statement was recorded from him on 25 April 2017, more than three months after his first statement was recorded on 18 January 2017. He therefore had more than ample time to reflect and recall the massages he had performed on the Complainant – which he also described as having been of some “prominence”. In addition, this was the accused’s _second_ statement, in relation to the _same_ matter involving the Complainant. Indeed, he had stated as follows in the opening sentence of his statement: “In furtherance to the statement given by me on 18 January 2017, IO Faizal called me for another round of interview and wish\[ed\] to clarify certain things with me”. It could not therefore have been the case that he “didn’t know what to expect” or that he was in a “state of shock” or “confused” when his second statement was recorded. His claim that he had had “such short time” to give his statement also had little basis. His two-page statement, comprising of just six paragraphs, was recorded from him over the course of about 70 minutes. Indeed, the accused never raised any of these claims when his statement was admitted into evidence by the Defence as _his_ exhibit. I set out the accused’s testimony:[\[note: 595\]](#Ftn_595)

> Q:    There is no reason \[why you were unable to recall at the time of \[your\] statement recording \[in April 2017 but were then\] able to recall…in such great detail \[when you testified in July 2019\], isn’t it?

> A:    When I was called, I don’t have time to recall the whole account, I didn’t know what to expect. I had such short time to write this---to tell the statement. But after this, I have like…a lot of reflection, I did a lot of recalling and those are the prominence ones. Sorry, those are the one\[s\] I recalled.

> Q:    So when you say, “Those are the ones I recalled.” …there’s a possibility of other massages…that you do not recall?

> A:    No…I correct…those are the one\[s\] I did. Sorry, those are the massages.

> **Q:**      **So this statement was recorded on 25th April 2017, am I right?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And you were first called to the police station on the 18th of January 2017, am I right?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> **Q:**      **And \[as of\] 18th January 2017, you were aware of the allegation that you had molested \[the Complainant\] during a massage, am I right?**

> **A:**      **Yes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

388    The accused had also testified that, despite trying to do so, he could not recall the number of occasions he had massaged the Complainant at the time his second statement was recorded on 25 April 2017:[\[note: 596\]](#Ftn_596)

> **Q:**      **And so, between January 2017 and April 2017, you would have reflected long and hard about when you \[had\] massaged \[the Complainant\], when \[this massage\] could …have taken place, wouldn’t you?**

> **A:**      **I tried.**

> **Q:**      **And at that point, you couldn’t remember even though you tried, isn’t it?**

> **A:**      **No**, I was going through a phase…

> Q:    \[W\]hat phase were you going through?

> A:    I was going through a tough time. Then I didn’t know that it could extend to such depth of the case. And I didn’t do much thinking about it, but it was more like why is she doing this, which like this, ah.

> Q:    So if I confirm your evidence correctly, a very serious allegation had been made against you on the 18th of January \[2017\], but you didn’t try and think what on earth happened that she might make this allegation, isn’t it?

> A:    That was what I was trying to think about.

> **Q:**      **And even though you thought about that, you couldn’t recall specifically how many times you had massaged \[the Complainant\] \[as\] at 25th April 2017, isn’t it?**

> **A:**      **No, Sir.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

389    But, if the accused was indeed unable to remember on 25 April 2017 (when his statement was recorded) the number of occasions he had massaged the Complainant, how and why was he able to better recall this – and many more other details[\[note: 597\]](#Ftn_597) – when he testified more than two years later? The accused never satisfactorily explained why he was able to do so. To my mind, this was because his testimony on this aspect was an afterthought.

390     Third, the accused and the Mother were inconsistent on _when_ the accused had performed his “demonstration” massage on the Mother and the Complainant. The accused said he did so about a “couple of weeks” _after_ 28 July 2016 (the date he had gone for a “sports massage”). In contrast, the Mother said the accused had performed his “demonstration” massage on her and the Complainant on the _same_ day he had returned to the Flat from his “sports massage”. The accused and the Mother were also inconsistent on why they had supposedly laughed on this occasion. The accused claimed the Mother and the Complainant had laughed because it had been “so painful” when he massaged them. In contrast, the Mother said they had all laughed because of some “pictures” the accused had apparently shown them of the “sports massage” he had attended earlier that day.[\[note: 598\]](#Ftn_598)

391     Fourth, the accused and the Mother were inconsistent on _when_ the accused’s massage in relation to the Bedroom Incident had happened. The accused confirmed in cross-examination that he had massaged the Complainant in her bedroom after his “demonstration” massage. In contrast, the Mother said the accused had massaged the Complainant in her bedroom only after his “demonstration” massage _and_ after his massage at the dining area.[\[note: 599\]](#Ftn_599)

392     Fifth, the accused and the Mother were inconsistent on the:

> (a)     number of massages for which the Mother was in the Flat; and

> (b)     number of massages the Mother had personally witnessed.

393    The accused testified that: [\[note: 600\]](#Ftn_600)

> (a)     the Mother was in the Flat during two of his massages; and

> (b)     the Mother had personally witnessed one of these massages (namely, the “demonstration” massage).

394    In contrast, the Mother testified that:[\[note: 601\]](#Ftn_601)

> (a)     she was in the Flat during three of the accused’s massages; and

> (b)     she had personally witnessed two of these massages.

395    In any event, the inconsistent testimonies of the accused and the Mother were also inconsistent with the accused’s second statement. There, he had stated that “\[a\]ll of the massages \[he performed on the Complainant\] took place whenever \[his\] son…and \[the Helper\]…\[were\] at home and \[the Mother was\] away at work, or she \[was\] in school.”[\[note: 602\]](#Ftn_602) Indeed, even the accused conceded that this part of his second statement was inconsistent with his testimony.[^603] On the other hand, I noted that this part of the accused’s statement was consistent with the Complainant’s testimony and her Note – where she stated that the Mother had not been in the Flat on all the occasions the accused had massaged her.[^604]

396    Against this backdrop, I rejected the testimonies of the accused and the Mother in relation to the (four) massages they claimed the accused had performed on the Complainant.

##### (3)   Evidential issues _vis-à-vis_ Bedroom Incident

397    There were also several deficiencies in the accused’s narrative of the incident in the Complainant’s bedroom. First, his account in his testimony as to the circumstances which led him to massage the Complainant (including his exchange with her at the dining table)[\[note: 605\]](#Ftn_605) was absent from both of his statements – which had been recorded from him much closer in time to this incident (when his memory of this incident would have been fresher). The relevant extracts from his statements are set out in the table below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="40.1%"><col width="59.9%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Accused’s statements</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Extract</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">First statement, recorded on 18 January 2017 (Exhibit D8)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“I wished to state that sometime last year [in 2016], I did…a massage on [the Complainant’s] back as during that period of time, she’s been complaining of having backaches. She was in her room and it was roughly about 8pm. I entered her room and offered to massage her back to ease her backache. She agreed and allow[ed] me to massage her back.”</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Second statement, recorded on 25 April 2017 (Exhibit D9)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“I did most of the massage on [the Complainant’s] back while she is in a sitting position or lying sideways at both the living room and her bedroom. There was once [in 2016] that I massaged [the Complainant’s] back when she was lying on her bed sideways. She was facing the window and I was sitting and standing beside her. It was in the evening, my wife was not at home.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

398    The accused’s first statement, in particular, indicated that there had been no prior communication between him and the Complainant when he “entered \[the Complainant’s\] room and offered to massage her back”. This was, in fact, consistent with the Complainant’s testimony – in which she stated that the accused had simply entered her bedroom and asked her if she wanted a massage.[\[note: 606\]](#Ftn_606)

399     Second, the Defence never challenged the Complainant’s testimony that the door to the Helper’s bedroom was closed/locked at the time of the Bedroom Incident.[\[note: 607\]](#Ftn_607) It was only during the accused’s examination-in-chief that he belatedly testified that the door to the Helper’s bedroom was open when he was massaging the Complainant (implying that he could not have molested the Complainant as he would have been readily discovered).[^608] Pressed on his failure to challenge the Complainant’s testimony in this regard, the accused claimed, once more[^609], that he did not know he could do so (although he said he knew that she was supposedly lying about this fact during her testimony).[^610] His response was, again, at odds with his earlier confirmation that it had been on his instructions that the Defence had put it to the Complainant that she was lying about the Three Incidents.[^611]

400     Third, the accused’s testimony was inconsistent with his statements as to what he was doing just before the Mother returned to the Flat.[\[note: 612\]](#Ftn_612) He testified that he had stopped massaging the Complainant, told her to “rest”, and then left her bedroom for the living room where he switched on the television. He also said he had been watching television in the living room when the Mother returned to the Flat.[^613] The Mother had testified to similar effect.[^614] In contrast, his accounts in both of his statements indicated that he had stopped “massaging” the Complainant only when the Mother returned to the Flat:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="40.1%"><col width="59.9%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Accused’s statements</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Extract</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">First statement, recorded on 18 January 2017 (Exhibit D8)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“Whilst massaging [the Complainant], [the Mother] came back home from work.

During the massage, [the Mother] returned home and opened the main door. As such, I stopped the massage and le[ft] [the Complainant’s] bedroom to receive [the Mother] from the main door.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

401    These extracts from the accused’s statements were, in fact, consistent with the Complainant’s Note and her testimony (which was also not challenged by the Defence) – where she stated that the accused had only stopped doing what he had been doing when the Mother returned to the Flat.[\[note: 615\]](#Ftn_615) Indeed, even the accused agreed that his statements were consistent with the Complainant’s evidence.[^616]

402     Fourth, the accused’s account in his testimony as to his exchange with the Mother after the Mother had returned to the Flat and the Mother’s subsequent actions of going into the Complainant’s bedroom to check on her and giving her medication[\[note: 617\]](#Ftn_617) (which was also reflected in the Mother’s testimony[^618]) was absent from both of his earlier statements.

403     Fifth, all aspects of the Mother’s testimony as to what had happened in the Flat before she returned home that evening was hearsay evidence. The Mother’s testimony on these aspects was hence not admissible as evidence of the truth of what did, in fact, happen that evening. This included aspects such as: what the accused had done in the Complainant’s bedroom just before she returned to the Flat; where the accused and the Helper had been just before she returned to the Flat; and whether the accused had indeed been watching television in the living room just before she returned to the Flat.[\[note: 619\]](#Ftn_619)

404    Against this backdrop[\[note: 620\]](#Ftn_620), I rejected the testimonies of the accused and the Mother in relation to the incident in the Complainant’s bedroom.[^621] The case mounted by the accused in relation to this incident was fraught with inconsistencies; belated assertions; and hearsay evidence. It did not create a reasonable doubt in the Complainant’s consistent evidence on the Bedroom Incident.[^622] Given that the Complainant also had no motive to falsely implicate the accused[^623], I saw no reason to disbelieve her evidence on the Bedroom Incident.

405    My preference for the Complainant’s evidence meant (among other things) that the Mother never entered the Complainant’s bedroom after she returned to the Flat to check on how the Complainant was feeling or to give the Complainant medication. It also meant that the Mother never asked the Complainant the next morning: about her “back pain”; whether she wanted to see a doctor; or whether she needed medication.[\[note: 624\]](#Ftn_624) Indeed, no part of this supposed conversation between the Mother and the Complainant on the morning after the incident in the Complainant’s bedroom was ever put to the Complainant.

##### (4)   No reasonable doubt raised _vis-à-vis_ Master Bedroom Incident

406    The accused claimed that the Master Bedroom Incident never happened. To buttress this claim, the Defence relied on the Mother’s testimony. The Mother had testified that she did not think that the Master Bedroom Incident could have happened because “no one is allowed to be in the master bedroom except for \[her\], \[the accused\], and \[the Stepbrother\]”.[\[note: 625\]](#Ftn_625) The Defence therefore argued that the Master Bedroom Incident could not have happened, and reasoned as follows:[^626]

> 212.  …it is apparent that there are rules in \[the accused’s\] and \[the Mother’s\] household for all members to follow, such as….no entry into \[the\] master bedroom for some members…\[and\] the Defence submits that each and every member knows and practice these rules.

> 213.  As such, if \[the accused\] were to pull \[the Complainant\] into the master bedroom, it would be considered abnormal and unusual and draw attend of the \[Helper\] or even \[the 4-year-old Stepbrother\] and accordingly lead to their interference or intervention. Also such an incident will easily reach \[the Mother’s\] ears. It would just take \[the Stepbrother\] to say something innocent like “I saw papa pulling kaka going into our room” to set \[the Mother\] off. Children are keenly observant and here, it is a 4-year-old child, who like any other 4-year-old will probably seek attention of \[the accused\] or \[the Complainant\] every few minutes or so. \[The Defence\] submit\[s\] that \[the accused\] cannot be that reckless or that foolish to so easily subject himself to such unnecessary attention.

407    These assertions by the Defence were not relatable to, or supported by, the evidence adduced. They were never raised during the Complainant’s cross-examination. The accused did not even say that the Master Bedroom Incident could not have happened because the Complainant was supposedly not allowed to enter the master bedroom. In any event:

> (a)     no evidence was adduced to suggest that the accused was incapable of violating this purported household rule.

> (b)     the Defence’s suggestion that the accused _could_ have been caught was speculative and ultimately irrelevant to the issue of whether the Master Bedroom Incident did, in fact, happen.[\[note: 627\]](#Ftn_627) This was in light of the Complainant’s testimony that:

>> (i)       her Stepbrother had been playing in the living room just before the accused dragged/pulled her into the master bedroom.

>> (ii)       the Helper had been in the kitchen just before the accused dragged/pulled her into the master bedroom.

>> (iii)       she did not shout for help while the accused was dragging/pulling her into the master bedroom (as she was scared)

>> (iv)       she did not shout for help while the accused was molesting her in the master bedroom (because she was “scared” he would do something worse to her if she did).

>> (v)       the door to the master bedroom had only been “slightly opened” at the time the accused and the Complainant were inside the master bedroom.

> (c)     the Mother’s testimony as to whether the Master Bedroom Incident happened was hearsay evidence, in light of the Complainant’s testimony that the Mother was not in the Flat when this incident happened. The Mother’s testimony was hence not admissible as evidence of whether the Master Bedroom Incident did, in fact, happen.

408    Against this backdrop and given that the Complainant also had no motive to falsely implicate the accused, I saw no reason to disbelieve the Complainant’s otherwise consistent testimony on the Master Bedroom Incident.

##### (5)   Evidential issues _vis-à-vis_ Sofa Incident

409    In relation to the Sofa Incident, I preferred the testimony of the Complainant over the evidence advanced by the accused and the Mother. This was for four reasons. First, this was in light of my findings that:[\[note: 628\]](#Ftn_628)

> (a)     the Sofa Incident had happened sometime in 2016, before the Complainant’s 14th birthday on 21 December 2016.

> (b)     the Sofa Incident had happened well before the Lunchbox Incident happened on 10 January 2017.

> (c)     only the accused had spoken to the Complainant, and disciplined her, over a necklace during the Sofa Incident in 2016.

> (d)     only the Mother had spoken to the Complainant about the Lunchbox Incident on 10 January 2017.

> (e)     the accused never spoke to the Complainant, or disciplined her, over the Lunchbox Incident or over a necklace on 10 January 2017 (the date of the Lunchbox Incident).

410     Second, the Defence never challenged the Complainant’s testimony that she had gone into her bedroom to sleep after the accused was “done talking” to her on the day of the Sofa Incident.[\[note: 629\]](#Ftn_629) In addition, it was never put to the Complainant that the Mother had also spoken to her after the accused had done so.[^630] It was also not put to the Complainant that the Mother had “threatened” to “send \[the Complainant\] to a girls’ home if she refused to change her ways” (and therefore, by extension, that the Complainant had “broke\[n\] down and cried” when she heard this threat). The failure to put these aspects to the Complainant during cross-examination was surprising, given the Mother’s confirmation that the accused was also aware of this alleged conversation between her and the Complainant.[^631] Neither was this subsequent conversation between the Mother and the Complainant referred to in the accused’s statements – which were recorded from him much closer in time to the Sofa Incident, when his memory of such a conversation would have been fresher. Indeed, the relevant aspect of the accused’s second statement had simply stated as follows:[^632]

> 12    Sometime in January 2017, \[the Complainant\] already started schooling. It was in a weekday evening, my wife was not at home, the night before or the same morning. I asked my wife for permission to speak to \[the Complainant\] because she threw away the food that we packed for her. My wife gave her consent. So, I spoke to \[the Complainant\] while we are in the living room sofa…I did not pull \[the Complainant’s\] t-shirt to see her necklace**. While I was talking to her, my wife returned home. Later on, contractors came to discuss about the house renovation for our new house**…We moved into the new house on the 14 February 2017 if I remember correctly because I have to handover the keys of my old house on the 16 February 2017.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

411    The belated assertions of the accused and the Mother indicated that their testimonies as to this subsequent conversation between the Mother and the Complainant were afterthoughts. I agreed with the Prosecution that this subsequent conversation never happened.[\[note: 633\]](#Ftn_633)

412     Third, the accused’s testimony as to the Complainant’s conduct during the Sofa Incident was inconsistent with his second statement.[\[note: 634\]](#Ftn_634) In this regard, he had testified that the Complainant had looked “more tense” than sad as he spoke to her. He further said that she was “very stiff”, had looked at him in a “challenging” way, and had “got a bit agitated”. He also added that things got “even worse” when he spoke to the Complainant about her necklace. He claimed that things “got a bit tense” and the Complainant started displaying “challenging” “body language”. He further claimed that the Complainant had verbally denied that she was wearing a necklace.[^635] The Mother had also testified to a similar effect.[^636] But, none of these aspects appeared in the accused’s second statement. Indeed, he had stated the contrary in this statement. There, he stated that the Complainant: had not said anything; had remained quiet and listened to him; and had heeded his advice and not worn a necklace to school the following day. The relevant aspects in the accused’s statement read as follows:[^637]

> 12    Sometime in January 2017, \[the Complainant\] already started schooling. It was in a weekday evening, my wife was not at home, the night before or the same morning. I asked my wife for permission to speak to \[the Complainant\] because she threw away the food that we packed for her. My wife gave her consent. So, I spoke to \[the Complainant\] while we are in the living room sofa. My son was seated on my right and \[the Complainant\] was sitting on my left. I placed both of my arms on my sofa and my left hand is on \[the Complainant’s\] shoulder while my right hand is on son’s shoulder. I spoke to \[the Complainant\] and asked her why she threw away the food that we had packed for her. She replied that she is ashamed because her friends in school did not bring food to school. Probably, her schoolmates had made fun of her. So, I told her to be humble in school, I also noticed her wearing necklace to school for quite sometime and I told her not to wear any necklace when you go to school, just wear it during weekends or when we go out as a family. **\[The Complainant\] did not say anything, she just remains quiet and listen to me**…**The next morning, she went to school without her necklace**…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

413    Indeed, this aspect of the accused’s statement was consistent with the Complainant’s testimony – where she stated she had been “reflecting on” herself when the accused was disciplining her (until he held the neckline of her T-shirt).[\[note: 638\]](#Ftn_638)

414     Fourth, the evidence adduced showed that the accused had shifted his position on whether he had pulled down the neckline of the Complainant’s T-shirt (to expose the chain of her necklace). While he testified that he did do this,[\[note: 639\]](#Ftn_639) he had said otherwise in his second statement.[^640] When confronted about this inconsistency, he admitted in cross-examination that he had “changed \[his\] story” after hearing the Complainant’s testimony.[^641] In re-examination, however, he provided a different account. There, he testified that the officer who had recorded his second statement (_viz_, IO Faizal) had told him that the Complainant had claimed that he had pulled at her T-shirt “forcefully”. He even said that IO Faizal had demonstrated this to him. As he “didn’t do” this, he said he therefore stated in his statement that he “did not pull \[the Complainant’s\] t-shirt to see her necklace”. If this had indeed happened during his statement recording, there was no reason why he could not have said this in cross-examination. There was also no reason why he could not have simply stated in his second statement that he did not pull the Complainant’s T-shirt _forcefully_ or that he had only pulled her T-shirt _slightly_ (if this had indeed been what he had wanted to communicate during his statement recording). His failure to provide a satisfactory/consistent explanation for this shift in his position did not reflect well on his credibility as a witness.

##### (6)   Belated assertions on relationship with Mother & accused

415    The Complainant had consistently testified that she was not close to the Mother. This had been the case before December 2014, and it remained so even after she started staying in the Flat on weekdays from December 2014 until the Report was lodged on 18 January 2017. She had similarly informed the Teacher (on 11 January 2017) and the Counsellor (on 13 January 2017) of her poor relationship with the Mother. She had further testified that she was scared of the Mother, a point which the Stepmother echoed.[\[note: 642\]](#Ftn_642) The testimonies of all these witnesses on the poor relationship between the Complainant and the Mother were never challenged by the Defence during cross-examination.

416    In cross-examination, the Complainant had also testified that she would “mostly go inside \[her bedroom\] to hide \[herself\]” to “prevent \[herself from\] getting scolded”.[\[note: 643\]](#Ftn_643) This aspect of her testimony was also never challenged by the Defence during cross-examination. Indeed, it was also consistent with the following extract from the accused’s second statement[^644] – which read as follows:

> 10    The relationship between \[the Complainant\] and \[the Mother is\] tense. \[The Complainant\] will always hide in her room whenever \[the Mother\] is around. There are many problems between \[the Complainant\] and \[the Mother\] such as her character and she makes mistakes such as lying to \[to the Mother\] about school matters.

417    In examination-in-chief, the accused was asked to explain why he had used the word “hide” in his second statement. He clearly displayed some difficulty in downplaying his choice of word. He first said that he had used the word “hide” because “normally...at night, \[the Complainant would\] technically be in her \[bedroom\]”. When pressed further by the Defence to explain why he had specifically used the word “hide”, he said he had done so because the Complainant would, in 2016, “speak one word, one word and then she \[would\] keep away from \[him and the Mother\]”. To my mind, neither of the accused’s “explanations” in his examination-in-chief were persuasive in explaining away his choice of “hide”.

418    In cross-examination, the accused initially said that the Complainant would “hide” in her bedroom whenever the Mother was in the Flat in the later part of 2016. However, he quickly changed his position when the Prosecution repeated its question. He then claimed that he had used the “wrong word” and said that the “right word” should have been that the Complainant was “more reserved”.[\[note: 645\]](#Ftn_645) In re-examination, he again displayed some difficulty in downplaying his choice of “hide”. At this stage, he repeated that he had used the wrong term in his second statement. He then said that what he meant to say was that the Complainant would “go to her room and read her book, and \[would\] only come out when necessary” and that she would “not really hide as in in fear”.[^646]

419    I gave no weight to the accused’s belated attempts to downplay his choice of the word “hide” in his second statement. The Complainant’s testimony on this point not challenged when she testified.[\[note: 647\]](#Ftn_647) Based on a plain reading of the accused’s second statement[^648], it was clear that he was stating that the Complainant would “always hide in her room whenever \[the Mother was\] around” because their relationship was “tense” and given the “many problems” between them.

420    I was aware of aspects of the Mother’s testimony, which sought to portray that she shared a “very close relationship” with the Complainant.[\[note: 649\]](#Ftn_649) The Mother’s belated assertions in this regard were inconsistent with the Complainant’s unchallenged testimony.[^650] They were also inconsistent with the WhatsApp correspondence between the Mother and the Complainant in relation to the Lunchbox Incident. Indeed, this correspondence supported a finding that the Complainant and the Mother had a poor or “tense” relationship. On this note, I agreed with the following aspects of the Prosecution’s submissions:[^651]

> 181.  \[The Mother’s\] lack of trust in the \[Complainant\] is evidenced by her reaction after learning that \[the Complainant\] had secretly left her packed lunch behind instead of bringing it to school. Instead of confronting \[the Complainant\] directly about the packed lunch, \[the Mother\] test\[ed\] \[the Complainant’s\] honesty by asking \[her\] if she \[had\] brought her packed lunch to school.[^652] Although \[the Mother\] denied it in during cross-examination, it is patently clear that \[the Mother’s\] intention in messaging \[the Complainant\] to ask whether she had brought along her packed lunch was to test whether \[the Complainant\] would lie about it as \[the Mother\], in fact, already knew by then that \[the Complainant\] had left her packed lunch outside the Flat at the \[Duct\].[^653] If \[the Mother\] had trusted \[the Complainant\], this “test” would have been unnecessary.

> 182.  Thereafter, instead of allowing \[the Complainant\] the opportunity to explain herself, \[the Mother\] rebukes \[the Complainant\] immediately for “throwing food away”, saying that \[the Complainant\] was “always disappointing \[her\] time and time again”.[^654] \[The Complainant\] might have had a compelling reason to leave her packed lunch behind that \[the Mother\] was unaware of. However, \[the Mother\] immediately presumed the worst of \[the Complainant\], and immediately started scolding her.

> 183.  \[The Mother’s\] attempt to downplay the difficulties in her relationship with \[the Complainant was\] inconsistent with \[the Complainant’s\] actions. \[The Mother\] claimed, _inter alia_, that “\[she had\] always thought that \[she and the Complainant had\] a very close relationship. Why? Because \[the Complainant\] shared with \[her\] a lot of stuff.”[^655] However, this is plainly contradicted by their actions. If \[the Complainant\] felt that they had a close relationship to the point of sharing “a lot of stuff” with \[the Mother\], she would not have felt the need to surreptitiously throw her packed lunch away, and thereafter lie to \[the Mother\] about it. If \[the Complainant\] was merely embarrassed about bringing food to school, this is a concern that \[the Complainant\] could have easily shared with \[the Mother\] if they had a close relationship.

421    Indeed, the Mother also tried to portray that the Complainant shared an even closer relationship with the accused. In this regard, the Mother testified that the Complainant and the accused shared a “very close” relationship, “like any other father and daughter relationship”, between 2014 and January 2017. She also said that she thought the Complainant was “even closer” to the accused than she was to her as the Complainant would always walk beside the accused when they went out. She even added that she could see that the Complainant was “very, very close” to the accused because she would “always run to him” whenever she needed help with her studies or phone.[\[note: 656\]](#Ftn_656) The Mother’s testimony was inconsistent with the Complainant’s unchallenged testimony, which was that she and the accused rarely spoke and were not close. The Complainant had even said that she felt uncomfortable around the accused.[^657] The Mother’s testimony was also inconsistent with the testimony of the accused, who only described his relationship with the Complainant as “okay”.[^658] It was further inconsistent with the accused’s testimony that the Complainant would, in 2016, only “speak one word, one word and then she \[would\] keep away from \[him and the Mother\]”.[^659]

#### Complainant’s evidence was unusually convincing

422    I found the Complainant’s consistent evidence to be unusually convincing. When weighed against the overall backdrop of the evidence presented, it contained that ring of truth that left me satisfied that no reasonable doubt existed in favour of the accused. I found it incredible that the Complainant, a timid young girl, would not only concoct false allegations against the accused but then go to great lengths, over the course of nearly 2½ years, to maintain these falsehoods – by lying to her Stepmother; her Teacher; the Counsellor; the Principal; the CPOs; the police; and to the court. This was especially in light of my finding that the Complainant had _no_ reason to falsely implicate the accused.

423    In contrast, aspects of the accused’s statements not only contradicted his testimony (and that of the Mother’s) but turned out to be consistent with the Complainant’s evidence. Many aspects of the Complainant’s testimony were not challenged by the Defence when the Complainant testified. But, many contrary assertions were made by the accused and the Mother during their subsequent testimonies. The belated nature of these assertions suggested that many facets of the accused’s case (including the Mother’s testimony) were afterthoughts, and should not be believed.

424    In these circumstances, I preferred the Complainant’s evidence over that advanced by the accused (as well as the Mother – who, as the Prosecution correctly observed, “showed herself to be inherently biased against \[the Complainant\], unreasonably disagreeing with the \[Complainant’s\] evidence regardless of the issue at hand, and even \[when\] she was in no position to contradict \[the Complainant’s\] evidence”).[\[note: 660\]](#Ftn_660)

425    The physical elements of the offences, as set out in the amended charges[\[note: 661\]](#Ftn_661), were clear from the Complainant’s evidence on the Three Incidents. These Three Incidents were all committed in 2016, before the Complainant’s 14th birthday on 21 December 2016. The Complainant would thus have been a “person under 14 years of age” at the time of their commission. In relation to the:

> (a)      Bedroom Incident, the accused’s intentional actions (as set out in the amended charge[\[note: 662\]](#Ftn_662)) readily satisfied the elements under s 350, read with ss 354(1) and (2), of the Penal Code – in that his actions all involved the intentional use of force to the then 13-year-old Complainant, without the Complainant’s consent, in order to outrage her modesty.

> (b)      Master Bedroom Incident, bearing in mind that the accused had already dragged/pulled the Complainant into the master bedroom without her consent, his subsequent intentional actions (as set out in the amended charge[\[note: 663\]](#Ftn_663)) readily satisfied the elements under s 350, read with ss 354(1) and (2), of the Penal Code – in that his actions all involved the intentional use of force to the then 13-year-old Complainant, without the Complainant’s consent, in order to outrage her modesty.

> (c)      Sofa Incident, the accused’s intentional actions (as set out in the amended charge[\[note: 664\]](#Ftn_664)), after he had _already_ pulled the neckline of the then 13-year-old Complainant’s T-shirt down, was a clear intrusion upon her privacy and done with the intention of insulting her modesty. Even if the accused had wanted to see/expose the Complainant’s necklace (assuming that she was indeed wearing one), there was no reason for him to, additionally, pull the neckline of her T-shirt up _and_ then tilt his head to look inside her T-shirt. His prior act of pulling the neckline of the Complainant’s T-shirt down would have already allowed him to see/expose the chain of the Complainant’s necklace and even its pendant (which would have extended just below her collarbone[^665]). The accused’s highly invasive action of pulling the neckline of the Complainant’s T-shirt up and then tilting his head to look inside her T-shirt was a clear intrusion upon her privacy and done with the intention of insulting her modesty.

426    I therefore convicted the accused on the amended charges. I now explain the sentences imposed.

## Reasons for sentences

427    The accused was a “multiple offender” (_viz_, an offender to be sentenced for convictions on multiple offences).[\[note: 666\]](#Ftn_666) I therefore applied the framework in _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_[^667] (“_Raveen_”) and _Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP_[^668] in sentencing.

### Stage 1: Appropriate sentence for each proceeded charge

428    The first stage is to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence. This may be done by applying a sentencing framework or by analogising with precedents. In arriving at the individual sentences, the court will generally have to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon each sentence (_Raveen_ at \[98\]). On this note, there was a significant divergence in the sentencing positions of the Prosecution and DC – on the individual sentences and the total sentence. The positions are set out in the following table (the shaded boxes denote the sentences that each party was urging the court to run consecutively):[\[note: 669\]](#Ftn_669)

#### Sentences for outraging Complainant’s modesty

429    The Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident concerned offences punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. For each incident, the accused “shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments”.

430    In _GBR_, the High Court had laid down a sentencing framework for offences under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. In _GDC_, the High Court remarked that the sentences imposed in _GBR_; _BRJ v PP_[\[note: 670\]](#Ftn_670) (“_BRJ_”); and _BPH v PP_ (“_BPH_”)[^671] “appeared….to have been lower than might have been appropriate under the strict application of the _GBR_ framework”.[^672] Sentences of between 25 to 30 months’ imprisonment had been imposed in _GBR_; _BRJ_; and _BPH_. The High Court in _GDC_ also remarked that the “correct application of the _GBR_ framework could have justified a higher sentence being imposed”[^673] on the offender in _GDC_ (who was eventually sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane). The Prosecution explained that its submission for a “deterrent sentence” in this case[^674] was in light of these “comments” by the High Court in _GDC_ and “based on the _GBR_…framework”.[^675]

431    DC responded that the “comments” of the High Court in _GDC_ were, strictly speaking, _obiter dicta_. DC noted that the Prosecution had “unfortunately omitted” the “equally important” remark of the High Court in _GDC_ that followed these initial “comments”.[\[note: 676\]](#Ftn_676) This was to the effect that although the High Court in _GDC_ felt that the “correct application of the _GBR_ framework could have justified a higher sentence being imposed” on the offender in _GDC_ in light of “the number and nature of \[the\] aggravating factors in \[_GDC_\]”, it nevertheless “felt obliged to maintain an appropriate degree of relativity” with _GBR_; _BRJ_; and _BPH_.[^677] DC therefore urged the court to “bear in mind the sentences passed in other cases which involve\[d\]…a greater degree of egregiousness, and the degree of relativity” in relation to the sentences that should be imposed in this case.[^678]

432    The Prosecution responded that the “nub of the issue” was whether this court “should “correctly apply” the _GBR_…framework in line with the manner envisioned by the \[High Court in _GBR_\], and as alluded to by the \[High Court in _GDC_\]”. The Prosecution noted that the High Court in _GDC_ had remarked that “the application of the _GBR_…framework “may have to be reconsidered on a future occasion”. It thus submitted that it was “now open for this \[court\] to calibrate the appropriate sentence for the accused in accordance with the correct application of the _GBR_…framework”.[\[note: 679\]](#Ftn_679) The Prosecution did not explain what a “correct application” of the _GBR_ framework necessarily entailed (apart from suggesting that higher sentences should now be imposed for all offences under s 354(2) of the Penal Code by virtue of the _obiter dicta_ in _GDC_).

433    To be accurate, the High Court in _GDC_ had remarked that “the sentencing framework for s 354(2) offences or its application may have to be reconsidered on a future occasion”.[\[note: 680\]](#Ftn_680) The Prosecution had focused on only the latter aspect[^681] and not the former aspect in submitting that it was “now open for this \[court\] to calibrate the appropriate sentence for the accused in accordance with the correct application of the _GBR_…framework”. In any event, I did not think that it was appropriate for this court, a lower court of first instance, to reconsider the “sentencing framework for s 354(2) offences” or “its application”. As with sentencing benchmarks, sentencing frameworks (and, in particular, a reconsideration of an existing framework laid down by the High Court, which has also been endorsed by the Court of Appeal[^682]) should be left to the appellate court.[^683]

434    In addition, notwithstanding the _obiter_ “comments” of the High Court in _GDC_, I noted that the _GBR_ framework continues to be applied by the High Court and the Court of Appeal.[\[note: 684\]](#Ftn_684) Even the Prosecution continues to rely on the _GBR_ framework in its sentencing submissions for offences under s 354(2) of the Penal Code.[^685] I thus relied on the _GBR_ framework, and reported precedents that have applied the _GBR_ framework, to calibrate the sentences in this case.

##### (1)   Offence-specific factors

435    I first considered the offence-specific factors. There are three main categories of such factors: the degree of sexual exploitation; the circumstances of the offence; and the harm caused to the victim.[\[note: 686\]](#Ftn_686) These offence-specific factors are used to ascertain the gravity of the offence, so that the offence may be placed within an appropriate band of imprisonment.[^687]

(A)   Degree of sexual exploitation

436    The first category of offence-specific factors relates to the degree of sexual exploitation. This factor includes the following aspects:[\[note: 688\]](#Ftn_688)

> (a)     Part(s) of the Complainant’s body the accused had touched or intruded upon.

> (b)     The manner in which the accused had touched the Complainant (_viz_, the intrusive nature of the accused’s acts).

> (c)     The duration of the outrage of modesty.

437    The offence is more aggravated where the:[\[note: 689\]](#Ftn_689)

> (a)     victim’s private parts or sexual organs are touched or intruded upon.

> (b)     the offender had made skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts or sexual organs, as opposed to touching the victim over her clothes.

> (c)     the sexual exploitation continued for a sustained period, as opposed to a fleeting moment.

(I)   BEDROOM INCIDENT

438    In relation to the Bedroom Incident, I noted that the accused had:

> (a)     used his right leg to _caress_ the Complainant’s calves; and

> (b)     slid his right hand under the Complainant’s T-shirt to:

>> (i)        _stroke_ her tummy; and

>> (ii)       then used his right hand to _grope_ her right breast from _outside_ her bra (while his hand was _still_ under her T-shirt).

439    That said, I noted that only the accused’s third action (_viz_, using his right hand to grope the Complainant’s right breast) involved an intrusion with her private parts (namely, her right breast). There was skin-to-skin contact between the accused’s right leg and the Complainant’s calves as well as between the accused’s right hand and the Complainant’s tummy. But, the contact in both instances did not involve the Complainant’s private parts or sexual organs. There was also no skin-to-skin contact between the accused’s right hand and the Complainant’s right breast (as the accused had groped the Complainant’s right breast _over_ her bra).[\[note: 690\]](#Ftn_690) In addition, the Complainant testified that the accused had not used much force when he was groping her right breast.[^691] However, I noted that this was not a case where the accused had groped the Complainant’s right breast over her T-shirt _and_ bra. He had groped her right breast over her bra after sliding his right hand _under_ her T-shirt. This was more intrusive.

440    The Prosecution did not adduce evidence from the Complainant on the:[\[note: 692\]](#Ftn_692)

> (a)     duration the accused had used his right leg to _caress_ her calves; and

> (b)     duration the accused had used his right hand to _stroke_ her tummy.

441    That said, given the nature of the contact in each instance, such contact would not have been merely momentary or fleeting in nature. But, the state of the evidence adduced in this case also did not permit me to say that the contact in each instance had, in fact, been for a sustained or prolonged period of time.

442    The Complainant did testify that the accused had groped her right breast over her bra for “a few minutes”.[\[note: 693\]](#Ftn_693) Such intrusive contact was certainly not momentary or fleeting in nature. But, the Prosecution did not clarify with the Complainant on what “a few minutes” actually entailed.

443    The Complainant’s testimony was also not clear as to the entire duration the accused had outraged her modesty (that is, the duration of the accused’s contact with her calves; her tummy; and her right breast).[\[note: 694\]](#Ftn_694) The following extract from the Complainant’s testimony was not clear as to whether she was saying that the entire Bedroom Incident (that is, including the accused’s initial massage of her back and spine[^695]) lasted for “a few minutes”; or if she was saying that she “felt something hard poking against \[her\] butt” for “a few minutes”:[^696]

> \[So, I was preparing to sleep but he came into my room\] And then, he asked me if I wanted a massage. Um, I wanted to say no but I was afraid to say no. So, I forced myself to agree to his offer…And then, um, he told me to lie on my bed, um, facing the wall on my left side. Then, um, he begin to massage my back and then, um, while massaging, he asked me if it hurts or not but I didn’t reply him because I was tired and then (clears throat) a few---like then later on he asked the same question if it hurts or not, but again, I didn’t reply him. And then slowly, he start to lie behind me and then, um, care---he used his leg to caress my leg. Then, um, after that he slide his hand into my shirt, stroke my tummy and then he went up to my chest area. And then um, I heard the sound of his pants like is as if it was--- he was, um, unbuckling his pants and then after that I felt like something hard poking against my butt. **It happened for a few minutes until the doorbell rings. Then, he left my room and opened the door for my mum**.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

444    The following extract from the notes of evidence also showed that the Prosecution thought that the “whole incident” had lasted for “a few minutes”:[\[note: 697\]](#Ftn_697)

> Q:    And…when you said that your stepfather **was doing** **all of those actions** do you---did you attempt to run out of the room or shout for help at that point in time?

> A:    No, but I thought of doing it.

> Q:    Why not?

> A:    Because I was scared that if I did uh make a noise or if I try to run away, he might do something more worse than that.

> Q:     **You mentioned that** **this happened for a few minutes, this whole incident** **, until the doorbell rang.** And he left your room and opened the door for your mother. How do you know that it was your mother at the door?

> A:    Because, um, on that night she was supposed to come back from her shift at work. And I know that, uh, it was her. I know that the doorbell rings because it rings. And the door was---the ledge of the door was closed.

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

445    One more aspect deserves some mention. The Complainant had testified in examination-in-chief that after the accused lay behind her on her bed and went up to her “chest area”, she heard a sound that sounded “like \[the accused\] was unbuckling his pants”. She added that she then “felt like something hard poking against \[her\] butt”.[\[note: 698\]](#Ftn_698) She also testified that she “was scared to look back” when she heard this sound. As such, she never saw what the accused was actually doing (and so she never saw what exactly was “poking against \[her\] butt”). However, she said she thought that the accused was “stroking…his private part against \[her\] butt”. She explained her conclusion on the basis that whatever that was “poking” or “stroking” “against \[her\] butt” was “hard” and “quite big” and she did not think that it was the accused’s fingers.[^699]

446    In cross-examination, the Complainant testified that the accused had “stopped massaging” her at the time she apparently heard him unbuckling his pants (_viz_, the accused had stopped using his hands). She was therefore not sure which hand he had used to supposedly unbuckle his pants. That said, she said she was “very sure” that it was the “sound of unbuckling the belt” that she had heard.[\[note: 700\]](#Ftn_700) She said she was not sure as to what was “poking” against her “butt”, but she disagreed that it could have been the accused’s foot or toe – and explained that this was because the accused’s “legs were on \[her\] legs when \[she\] felt something hard”.[^701]

447    In its closing submissions, the Prosecution submitted that the accused had unbuckled his pants and “was rubbing his erect penis over \[the Complainant’s\] buttocks (over her pants)”.[\[note: 702\]](#Ftn_702) But, the Prosecution never put this assertion to the accused during his cross-examination.[^703] I also asked the Prosecution to explain how the evidence that was adduced showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused “was rubbing his erect penis over \[the Complainant’s\] buttocks (over her pants)”.[^704] In its reply submissions, the Prosecution appeared to accept that the evidence adduced did not satisfy this high threshold:[^705]

> 65.     **\[The Complainant’s\] evidence did not extend so far as to state that the accused had rubbed his bare erect penis on her buttocks during \[the Bedroom Incident\].** However, \[the Complainant’s\] evidence is clear that she _heard_ the accused unbuckling his pants…and that she felt something hard poking against her buttocks. It is \[the Complainant’s\] clear evidence that she inferred from the circumstances that the hard thing that was poking against her buttocks was the accused’s penis. While **this was not specifically put to the accused during his cross-examination**…the accused was never prejudiced as he had the benefit of listening to the whole of \[the Complainant’s\] evidence, and he had the opportunity to respond to her version. Pertinently, the accused had testified that during the times when he would massage \[the Complainant\], he was wearing shorts, and would accordingly not have a need to unbuckle his belt. It is noteworthy that \[the Complainant\] has consistently testified to the best of her _recollection_, and was candid in admitting that she was too scared to look back to see what the accused was doing to her, **and therefore was not in a position to see \[the accused’s\] bare erect penis rubbing against her buttocks**.

> \[emphasis added in bold; emphasis in italics in original\]

448    In any event, I was not prepared to find that the accused had, in fact, been “rubbing his erect penis over \[the Complainant’s\] buttocks (over her pants)”. This was a significant assertion the Prosecution should have specifically put to the accused during his cross-examination. In addition, it was not clear as to what the Complainant meant when she said that the accused’s “legs were on \[her\] legs when \[she\] felt something hard”. She was not asked to elaborate on this aspect. Indeed, if _both_ of the accused’s _legs_ were on the Complainant’s legs at the material time, it would have been quite difficult for the accused to then “poke” or “stroke” his allegedly “erect penis” over the Complainant’s buttocks. The Complainant had also not testified as to where the accused’s hands were when she felt “something hard” “poking” or “stroking” “against \[her\] butt”. It could therefore have well been the accused’s hand(s) or a part of his hand(s) which the Complainant felt was “poking” or “stroking” “against \[her\] butt” (and the circumstances in which this might have happened were also unclear – namely, whether it was accidental or intentional).

449    Furthermore, the Prosecution never challenged the Mother’s testimony that the accused was in “soccer _shorts_” when she saw him on the evening of the Bedroom Incident.[\[note: 706\]](#Ftn_706) The Mother would have seen the accused in these shorts very soon after the Bedroom Incident had abruptly ended, given the Complainant’s testimony that the accused had stopped doing whatever he was doing when the Mother returned to the Flat. Indeed, the Complainant had also stated in her Note that she heard the accused “pulling his _shorts_ down” (and this aspect was not clarified with the Complainant as well).[^707] As such, it was not clear if the accused had even been wearing a pair of pants at the time of the Bedroom Incident.

450    All things considered, I did not think that the state of the evidence put before the court showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused:

> (a)     was wearing a pair of pants (which he could “unbuckle”) at the time of the Bedroom Incident; and

> (b)     had been “rubbing his erect penis over \[the Complainant’s\] buttocks (over her pants)” at some point during the Bedroom Incident.

(II)   MASTER BEDROOM INCIDENT

451    In relation to the Master Bedroom Incident, I noted that the accused had:

> (a)     put his left hand _under_ the Complainant’s left breast area; and

> (b)     put his right hand _under_ the Complainant’s right breast area.

452    Given the Complainant’s testimony that the accused had (only) put his left/right hand _under_ (instead of _over_) her left/right breast area, there was no intrusion into her private parts (namely, her left breast and her right breast). The accused also did not make skin-to-skin contact with her left breast area or her right breast area. There was also no such contact with the regions under these areas.[\[note: 708\]](#Ftn_708)

453    The Prosecution did not adduce evidence from the Complainant on the:[\[note: 709\]](#Ftn_709)

> (a)     duration the accused put his left hand under her left breast area.

> (b)     duration the accused put his right hand under her right breast area.

454    No evidence was also adduced from the Complainant as to the:[\[note: 710\]](#Ftn_710)

> (a)     number of times he put his left hand under her left breast area; and

> (b)     number of times he put his right hand under her right breast area.

455    Indeed, the Prosecution appeared to take the position that the accused had:

> (a)     put his left hand under the Complainant’s left breast area _once_; and

> (b)     put his right hand under the Complainant’s right breast area _once_.

456    This was evident from the assertions the Prosecution put to the accused during his cross-examination:[\[note: 711\]](#Ftn_711)

> Q:    And so, in relation to the \[Master Bedroom Incident\], I put it to you, that you had, in fact, massaged \[the Complainant\] in the master bedroom.

> A:    No.

> Q:    And this happened in 2016. I put it to you, that this…massage happened sometime in 2016. Agree or disagree?

> A:    Disagree.

> Q:    And I put it to you, that during that massage, you had made \[the Complainant\] stand in front of the bed and lie face down on the mattress.

> A:    No.

> **Q:**      **And I put it to you, that thereafter, you put your left hand under her left breast and pressed her left shoulder blade with your other hand.**

> A:    No.

> **Q:**      **And I put it to you, that thereafter, you put your right hand under her right breast and used your left hand to press her right shoulder blade.**

> A:    No.

> Q:    And I put it to you, that you did this with the intention to outrage her modesty.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

457    In these circumstances, I proceeded on the basis that the accused had:

> (a)     put his left hand under the Complainant’s left breast area _once_; and

> (b)     put his right hand under the Complainant’s right breast area _once_.

458    But, I did not think that the contact between the accused’s hand and the area under the Complainant’s breast was merely momentary or fleeting in nature in each instance. This was in light of the Complainant’s testimony that the accused:

> (a)     had put his left hand under her left breast area and then used his right hand to push against her shoulder blade (that is, while his left hand was _still_ under her left breast area).

> (b)     had put his right hand under her right breast area and then used his left hand to push against her shoulder blade (that is, while his right hand was _still_ under her right breast area).

459    However, I accepted DC’s submission on the duration the accused had put his left/right hand under the Complainant’s left/right breast area. DC had noted that no evidence on this issue had been adduced. As such, he urged the court to resolve this issue in the accused’s favour.[\[note: 712\]](#Ftn_712) I accepted that while the contact in each instance was not momentary or fleeting in nature, there was also no evidence to show that the contact on each occasion had lasted for a long time.

460    In its submissions, the Prosecution submitted that the entire Master Bedroom Incident had “lasted about 10 to 15 minutes”.[\[note: 713\]](#Ftn_713) In support of this proposition, the Prosecution referred to the Complainant’s testimony during her cross-examination by the Defence:[^714]

> **Q:**      **How long…this incident of this massage and your alleged molest occurred?**

> A:    Sorry?

> Q:    How long d---

> A:    Duration?

> Q:    duration?

> **A:**      **Like around 10---5, 10 minutes to 15 minutes.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

461    The Complainant thus appeared to be saying that the entire Master Bedroom Incident lasted for 5 minutes; 10 minutes; or 10 to 15 minutes. She was not asked to clarify her position in re-examination. When the Complainant’s testimony[\[note: 715\]](#Ftn_715) was brought to the Prosecution’s attention, the Prosecution acknowledged that her testimony was “quite vague”. The Prosecution also agreed that the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused “in all fairness”, and that the court should regard the entire Master Bedroom Incident as having lasted for 5 minutes. The Prosecution further informed the court that this duration of 5 minutes should “include the \[time expended by the accused in the\] massaging of the \[Complainant\]” as well as the time it took for the accused to pull the Complainant into the master bedroom.[^716]

462    However, the Prosecution reverted to its initial position (_viz_, the entire Master Bedroom Incident (including the massage) lasted for 10 to 15 minutes) in its subsequent submissions.[\[note: 717\]](#Ftn_717) The Prosecution explained that its position, now, was that the entire incident had lasted for 10 to 15 minutes based on its reading of the notes of evidence. It was not clear why this was not stated earlier[^718], given that the Prosecution’s attention was specifically drawn to the Complainant’s testimony. However, the Prosecution acknowledged that there was nothing in the notes of evidence that made it clear that the Complainant was, in fact, saying that the entire Master Bedroom Incident had lasted for 10 to 15 minutes.[^719]

463    Given the Complainant’s testimony as it appeared in the notes of evidence, I proceeded on the basis that the entire Master Bedroom Incident – from the time the accused had pulled the Complainant into the master bedroom to the time he told the Complainant that she was “free to go”[\[note: 720\]](#Ftn_720) – lasted for about 5 minutes. And, it was during these 5 minutes that the accused had:[^721]

> (a)     put his left hand under the Complainant’s left breast area _once_; and

> (b)     put his right hand under the Complainant’s right breast area _once_.

464    As with the Bedroom Incident[\[note: 722\]](#Ftn_722), the Prosecution had submitted that the accused had “unbuckled and pulled down his pants and rubbed his erect penis against \[the Complainant’s\] buttocks over her clothing” during the Master Bedroom Incident.[^723] In this regard, the Complainant had testified in examination-in-chief that she had “heard, like \[the accused’s\] belt \[being\] unbuckled and the sound of his pants, as if \[he\] was…pulling \[it\] down.” She added that she then “felt something hard against \[her\] butt.” She explained that she had concluded that the accused was “pulling down his pants” because she had used a pair of pants and a belt before and was hence familiar with the sounds made when one unbuckled one’s belt and when one pulled down one’s pants. She added that she also “heard the sound of \[the accused’s\] pants going back up” after she told him that she was “feeling better”. That said, she also testified that she was “scared” to see what the accused was doing when she heard him unbuckling his belt and pulling down his pants. As such, she never saw what the accused was, in fact, doing (and she never saw the “something” “hard” that was “poking against \[her\] butt”).[^724]

465    As with the Bedroom Incident[\[note: 725\]](#Ftn_725), the Prosecution never put it to the accused that he had “unbuckled and pulled down his pants and rubbed his erect penis against \[the Complainant’s\] buttocks over her clothing” during the Master Bedroom Incident. I also asked the Prosecution to explain how the evidence that was adduced showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused had rubbed his erect penis against \[the Complainant’s\] buttocks over her clothing” during the Master Bedroom Incident. The Prosecution’s reply was identical to that in relation to the Bedroom Incident[^726], where it appeared to accept that the evidence adduced did not satisfy this high threshold.

466    In any event, I was not prepared to find that the accused had, in fact, “unbuckled” his pants, pulled his pants down, and then “rubbed his erect penis against \[the Complainant’s\] buttocks over her clothing” during the Master Bedroom Incident. This was a significant assertion that the Prosecution should have specifically put to the accused during his cross-examination (even if the accused’s position on this incident was a bare denial). The Complainant had also not testified as to where the accused’s hands were when she felt “something” “hard” “poking against \[her\] butt”. It could therefore have well been the accused’s hand(s) or part of his hand(s) which the Complainant felt was “poking against \[her\] butt” (and the circumstances in which this might have happened were also unclear – namely, whether it was accidental or intentional). In these circumstances, I did not think that the state of the evidence put before the court showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused had “rubbed his erect penis against \[the Complainant’s\] buttocks over her clothing” during the Master Bedroom Incident.

(B)   Circumstances of the offences

467    The second category of offence-specific factors relates to the circumstances of the offence. The aspects relevant to this factor include:[\[note: 727\]](#Ftn_727)

> (a)     the abuse of a position of trust.

> (b)     whether the offence was premeditated or committed on the spur of the moment.

> (c)     the actual and/or threatened use of force or violence on the victim by the offender during, or to facilitate the commission of, the offence.

(I)   ABUSE OF POSITION OF TRUST

468    The accused was the Complainant’s stepfather. There was therefore an abuse of a position of trust in a familial context when the accused committed the offences relating to the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident. These offences had also been committed in the Flat – and, specifically, in the Complainant’s _own_ bedroom in relation to the Bedroom Incident. The Flat had, effectively, been the Complainant’s home for much of the period between December 2014 and 17 January 2017. It _should_ have been a safe sanctuary for her. The Complainant’s evidence was that she did not immediately tell the Mother or the police about the accused’s conduct because (among other things) she feared that nobody would believe her and that the Mother would “break her relationship” with her.[\[note: 728\]](#Ftn_728) This “underscores the very real concern that courts have over the difficulty of detection of such cases and, consequently, the view that general deterrence must feature prominently in the sentencing equation” for such cases (_GBR_ at \[42\]). That said, while there was indubitably an abuse of a position of trust in this case, the degree of trust that was, in fact, abused was somewhat ameliorated because the Complainant and the accused never shared a close relationship.[^729]

(II)   Opportunistic offending in Complainant’s bedroom

469    In relation to the Bedroom Incident, the Prosecution had initially stated as follows in its closing submissions:[\[note: 730\]](#Ftn_730)

> 21    Sometime in 2016 (before the \[Complainant’s\] birthday on 21 December 2016), **when \[the Complainant\] was preparing to sleep, the accused offered to give her a massage. Despite being uncomfortable with the offer, \[the Complainant\] agreed as she was afraid of saying “no” to the accused.** **\[The Complainant\] then heard the accused closing the latch of the main door of the Flat. The accused then returned to the room and began massaging \[the Complainant\]****.** During the massage, the accused caressed \[the Complainant’s\] legs and touched her right breast…

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

470    The Prosecution was therefore asserting that the accused had left the Complainant’s bedroom (after she had agreed to his offer of a massage); gone into the living room to close the latch of the main door of the Flat; and then returned to the Complainant’s bedroom to massage her. But, this assertion was never put to the accused by the Prosecution during his cross-examination.[\[note: 731\]](#Ftn_731) I also asked the Prosecution to explain how the evidence that was adduced showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused had, in fact, done this before he started massaging the Complainant in her bedroom.[^732]

471    In its reply submissions, the Prosecution appeared to accept that the evidence adduced did not satisfy this high threshold:[\[note: 733\]](#Ftn_733)

> 64.    In relation to the \[Prosecution’s\] Closing Submissions at \[21\], **the Prosecution’s case is that \[the Complainant\] had heard the accused closing the latch. \[The Complainant\] did not specifically see the accused doing so. Further, this was not put to the accused during his cross-examination.** However, this did not prejudice the accused’s defence as he was already aware of this aspect of \[the Complainant’s\] evidence, having had the opportunity to give evidence in response. In particular, the accused testified that if he had indeed locked the main door, the \[Helper\] would have come out from her room as she was waiting for \[the Mother’s\] return.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

472    However, the Prosecution resurrected this point in its sentencing submissions. In particular, the Prosecution submitted that there was premeditation on the part of the accused in relation to the Bedroom Incident because:[\[note: 734\]](#Ftn_734)

> …the accused had gone to close the latch of the main door of the \[Flat\] before he committed the offence. This points to an intention to conceal his activities and provide early-warning against anyone who was returning home.

473    That said, the Prosecution eventually withdrew this submission. It did so in the following terms:[\[note: 735\]](#Ftn_735)

> (**ii**)   **Element of premeditation (in relation to the Bedroom Incident)**

> 4.    The \[Complainant\] testified as follows:

>> a.    Before the incident happened, she heard the accused closing the main door of the Flat, i.e. the “very loud sound” when the ledge hits the main door…

>> b.    The \[Complainant\] was in her room preparing to sleep when the accused offered to massage her…

> 5.     _It is therefore unclear as to whether the accused had closed the ledge of the main door after asking the \[Complainant\] whether she wanted a massage. In this respect, the Prosecution respectfully withdraws our earlier statement…that the accused had closed the ledge of the main door after he asked the \[Complainant\] whether \[she\] wanted a massage_…

> \[emphasis added in italics; emphasis in bold in original\]

474    But, the Prosecution nonetheless maintained its submission that “there was premeditation for the Bedroom Incident”. In the alternative, it submitted that:[\[note: 736\]](#Ftn_736)

> …even if this \[court\] is not with the Prosecution that there were some form of deliberate steps taken by the accused to commit the offence, at the very least, he had displayed a significant degree of opportunism in committing this offence – and this would still be an aggravating factor: see \[_GCK_\] at \[200\].

475    However, the Prosecution did not specify the “deliberate steps \[that were purportedly\] taken by the accused” which would have supported a finding of premeditation on the accused’s part in relation to the Bedroom Incident.

476    The Complainant had testified that the accused had entered her bedroom while she was “preparing to sleep” and asked her if she wanted a massage. This had all happened when her Stepbrother was asleep; the Helper was in her own bedroom with the door closed/locked; and while the Mother was not in the Flat – aspects which the accused would have been well aware of when he entered the Complainant’s bedroom. The accused had then proceeded to massage the Complainant on her back and “spine area” and had also twice asked her “if it hurts or not”. It was only after he had been massaging the Complainant for about 5 minutes (during which she failed to respond to him on two occasions) that he lay behind her on her bed and outraged her modesty.[\[note: 737\]](#Ftn_737) To my mind, the most that could be said was that there was a significant degree of opportunism on the accused’s part. While he was in the Complainant’s bedroom massaging the Complainant, he had taken advantage of the fact that the Stepbrother, the Helper, and the Mother were not around, as well as the fact that the Complainant was not responding to him and might thus not offer much/any resistance.[^738] It appeared to me that he had then seized the opportunity to outrage the Complainant’s modesty on the spur of the moment rather than having acted in a calculated/premeditated manner.[^739] That said, such opportunism, whilst an aggravating factor, was not as serious as a finding that he evinced “considered commitment towards law-breaking” and took “deliberate steps” by scheming to enter the Complainant’s bedroom for the very purpose of sexually assaulting her (_GCK_ at \[200\]). I was hence mindful not to ascribe excessive weight to this factor.

477    In relation to the Master Bedroom Incident, the Prosecution did not make any submissions as to the presence of premeditation or a “significant degree of opportunism”.[\[note: 740\]](#Ftn_740) Based on the Complainant’s testimony,[^741] the Master Bedroom Incident appeared to have been committed on the spur of the moment. The evidence adduced did not suggest that the accused had acted in a calculated manner that evinced a “considered commitment towards law-breaking”.

(III)   Pulled Complainant into master bedroom

478    In relation to the Master Bedroom Incident, the Prosecution referred to the accused’s “use of criminal force” on the Complainant “before \[he\] committed the offence”. The Prosecution noted that the accused had “grabbed the \[Complainant’s\] arm and pulled her inside the master bedroom even though she tried to push herself away from the accused.”[\[note: 742\]](#Ftn_742) In this regard, I noted that the Complainant had testified that the accused had called out her name as she was walking to her bedroom. He then asked her if she wanted a massage. When she said “no”, he grabbed her by her forearm with his left hand and dragged/pulled her from the entrance of the master bedroom into the master bedroom. The Complainant said she tried to resist when the accused was dragging/pulling her by her forearm by trying to push herself away from him, but this was to no avail.[^743]

479    DC contended that the Prosecution was “estopped from submitting” that the accused had “grabbed \[the Complainant’s\] arm and pulled her inside the master bedroom despite her physical resistance”. According to DC, this assertion was never put to the accused during his cross-examination. As such, the accused was “never given an opportunity to respond” to this assertion. “Therefore, the Prosecution should not be allowed” to make this assertion, “especially in light of the fact that \[the Prosecution was now seeking\] an uplift in sentence” on the basis of this assertion. According to DC, the accused would be “irreparably prejudiced” if this court gave weight to this assertion that was “never put” to the accused.[\[note: 744\]](#Ftn_744)

480    The Prosecution acknowledged that it did not put this assertion to the accused during its cross-examination of the accused.[\[note: 745\]](#Ftn_745) However, it argued that there was nevertheless “no infringement of the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ in the present case”.[^746] In this regard, the Prosecution referred to the following observations of the High Court in _Ng Kum Weng v PP_[^747]:

> 59    …\[T\]he rule in _Browne v Dunn_…is a flexible rule of practice that requires that any contradiction in a witness’s evidence ought to be put to him so that he may explain…Its rationale is to grant a witness the opportunity to so “explain and clarify his or her position or version of facts before any contradictory version is put forth to the court as one of fact” …The key therefore is whether there is a contradiction between the evidence of the witness and the submissions made on his testimony…

481    The Prosecution submitted that the “mischief contemplated by the rule \[in _Browne v Dunn_\] is that a witness is not given an opportunity to explain or clarify his…position before any contrary version is advanced before the \[court\]”.[\[note: 748\]](#Ftn_748) According to the Prosecution, this “mischief \[did\] not operate in the present case as the accused \[was\] fully afforded \[the opportunity\] to explain or clarify his position as against the contrary version advanced by the Prosecution”.[^749] On this note, the Prosecution pointed out that in relation to the accused grabbing the Complainant’s arm and pulling her inside the master bedroom:[^750]

> i.    The \[Complainant’s\] testimony on this aspect \[also\] arose during the course of her cross-examination. The accused’s then-counsel…cross-examine\[d\] the \[Complainant\] on this aspect. Thereafter, the accused’s then-counsel put the Defence’s position to the \[Complainant\], which was that the accused did not grab and drag the \[Complainant\] into the master bedroom.

> ii.    In any case, the accused’s answer in cross-examination to the Master Bedroom Incident was that this entire incident never occurred. This echoes his instructions to his then-counsel that the incident where he grabbed the \[Complainant’s\] arm and pulled her inside the master bedroom did not happen.

482    The Prosecution submitted that the accused was hence “fully afforded the chance to proffer his explanations to the \[Complainant’s\] version.” It noted that the accused “had the benefit of listening to the \[Complainant’s\] evidence in full, and had ample opportunity to explain his version either…through his instructions to his then-counsel during the \[Complainant’s\] cross-examination; or…during his own oral evidence”. As such, the Prosecution submitted there was “no infringement” of the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ in this case.[\[note: 751\]](#Ftn_751)

483    I agreed with the Prosecution. The Complainant had given clear testimony, in examination-in-chief and cross-examination, that the accused had grabbed her arm and pulled her into the master bedroom.[\[note: 752\]](#Ftn_752) In cross-examination, the Defence had asked the Complainant to demonstrate how the accused had “dragged” her (which she did). The Defence had also clarified the following aspects with the Complainant: where the accused had first grabbed her; the hand the accused had used to grab her arm; why she did not “shout for help” when the accused grabbed her; the length of time the accused was “grabbing \[her\] and pulling \[her\]; if she did anything when the accused grabbed her arm (to which the Complainant said she resisted); how she had resisted; and if she had told the police that the accused had “grabbed \[her\] hand and dragged \[her\] to the bed” (which she said she did). The Defence had also put it to the Complainant that the accused “didn’t grab and drag \[her\] to the bed.”[^753] In addition, the Defence posed several questions to the accused on this aspect during his examination-in-chief:[^754]

> Q:    With regards to another incident, the Complainant has alleged that it happened…in your master bedroom, right. And you said, “No”?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    But she gave evidence that you offered to massage hr on that day.

> A:    No.

> **Q:**      **And you grabbed her arm and pulled her towards the master bedroom.**

> **A:**      **No, I didn’t.**

> **Q:**      **Why do you think she \[said\] this, that you offered to massage her and you grabbed her?**

> **A:**      **I don’t know.**

> **Q:**      **Have you ever grabbed \[the Complainant\]?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **Not even once when you were staying together?**

> **A:**      **No**.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

484    In these circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had ample opportunity to explain and clarify his position on whether he had grabbed the Complainant’s arm and dragged/pulled her into the master bedroom. He also had full notice beforehand, through the Complainant’s examination-in-chief and cross-examination, of various aspects of the Complainant’s assertion in this regard.[\[note: 755\]](#Ftn_755) This accords with the view that the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ should not be construed as a “rigid” or “technical rule” (_Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd_[^756]). The Prosecution’s case with respect to this assertion (based on the Complainant’s consistent testimony) was manifest from the outset. In these circumstances, its omission to put this assertion to the accused during his cross-examination did not, in my view, create any element of surprise which the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ so clearly deprecates (_PP v Okonkwo Gabriel_[^757]). I therefore took the view that the Prosecution could rely on the Complainant’s testimony that the accused had grabbed her arm with his hand and had then dragged/pulled her by this arm into the master bedroom. To my mind, this actual use of force on the Complainant by the accused, notwithstanding her resistance to his advances, was aggravating.[^758]

485    That said, I was mindful not to ascribe excessive weight to this factor (although I did not accept DC’s submissions that there was “either no or minimal force” used by the accused on the Complainant[\[note: 759\]](#Ftn_759)). This was in light of the Complainant’s testimony that the accused had grabbed and pulled her for (only) “a few seconds”.[^760] I also had regard to DC’s submissions that the force used in this case was far lesser than the force _and_ violence used in _PP v Azhar bin Mohamed_ (“_Azhar_”)[^761] and _GDC_:

> (a)     In _Azhar_, the 51-year-old offender faced two charges for outraging the modesty of his eight or nine-year-old stepdaughter. A similar charge was considered in sentencing. In respect of the first charge, the victim was alone with the offender at home and was watching television in the bedroom. The offender was sexually attracted to the victim, and had sexual urges towards her. He went into the bedroom and locked the door. He then told the victim to take off her shirt. The victim refused, and the offender scolded her. The victim did not reply. The offender then took a cane from the top of the cupboard and hit the victim with it. When the victim cried, the offender forcefully removed her shirt and pushed her onto the floor. He then pulled down the victim’s shorts and panties, and thereafter rubbed the victim on her breast, nipples, and vagina area. He also licked her nipples. The ordeal lasted for about 10 minutes before the offender stopped and allowed the victim to get dressed. In respect of the second charge, the victim was alone with the offender at home when he again felt sexually attracted to her. He then pulled the victim towards him and forcefully removed her panties before pushing her to the floor. While the victim was lying in a supine position on the floor, the offender pushed the victim’s legs apart and used his tongue to lick her vagina area for about five minutes.

> (b)     In _GDC_, the 35-year-old offender was the boyfriend of the 12-year-old victim’s mother. The victim knew him as her stepfather. The charge in question concerned an incident in the early hours of the morning. The victim was sleeping when she was woken up by the offender calling her name sometime between 3:00am and 4:00am. The offender lied to her that her mother had left the house. The victim went back to sleep, but then felt the offender’s hand under her bra on her left breast for about a minute, applying a significant amount of force. The offender then pulled her hair and brought her face close to his groin three or four times, but she did not see if his private parts were exposed as she had turned away. She did not shout for help because she was afraid and did not think anyone would or could help her. Ten minutes after the offender had pulled her hair, the offender slapped her twice. During the ten minutes that intervened between the offender’s pulling her hair and slapping her, the victim tried to avoid the offender’s overtures and to move to her brother’s bed (in the same room). As a result, she did not see precisely what the offender was doing in that time. The victim used a bolster, pillow, and jacket to try to cover herself, and eventually managed to move to her brother’s bed. The offender continued trying to touch the victim (but the victim did not provide specific details as to what this touching entailed), but stopped when the victim’s brother woke up briefly. The victim stayed in bed until about 5:00am, when her mother came into the room and the offender left.

486    However, I did give some weight to the brazenness of the accused’s conduct during the Master Bedroom Incident. Despite knowing of the possibility that the Helper, who was awake and in the Flat, might see him and/or stop him in his actions, he had audaciously pulled the Complainant into the master bedroom and outraged her modesty thereafter.

(IV)   COMPLAINANT WAS JUST BELOW 14 YEARS OF AGE

487    I noted that the Complainant was 13 years old at the time of the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident. But, this was just a year below the age ceiling in s 354(2) of the Penal Code. In this regard, I was mindful of the following observations in _GBR_ at \[29(f)\]:[\[note: 762\]](#Ftn_762)

> …\[Section\] 354(2) \[of the Penal Code\] is itself a provision that deals with outrage of modesty of a child below the age of 14. However, as pointed out by Aedit Abdullah JC…in \[_PP v BLV_[^763]\] at \[132\], **although the enhanced framework represents a general position that offences against minors should be dealt with more severely than those against non-minors, the framework did not intend to treat** **_all_** **offences committed against minors equally. The aggravating factor of young age would, in relation to enhanced offences, apply if the victim concerned was materially younger than the stipulated age ceiling, and in a graduated manner depending on how much younger the victim was.** I agree with this approach: if the offence were, for example, perpetrated against a toddler, this would be more aggravated than that against an older child for the reason that the toddler would be defenceless and unable to extricate himself or herself from the situation…

(C)   Harm caused to Complainant

488    The third category of offence-specific factors relates to the harm caused to the victim, whether physical or psychological.[\[note: 764\]](#Ftn_764) In this regard, the Prosecution submitted that the “accused’s actions caused the \[Complainant\] to be uprooted from the accused’s household and to be estranged from \[the Mother\], who has gone so far as to testify against the \[Complainant\], stating that their relationship has been “broken”.”[^765] In support of this contention, the Prosecution referred to certain statements made by the Complainant and the Mother during their testimonies. The relevant aspect of the Complainant’s examination-in-chief read as follows:[^766]

> Q:    After making the \[Report\] on the 18th of January 2017, can you describe how is your relationship with your mother now?

> A:    Um, we grew further \[apart\] but…**she** blocked me from all the social media\[\] and from…WhatsApp **she** blocked me and **she** told her…mother not to contact me anymore.

> Q:    And how do you feel about your relationship with her now?

> A:    I feel sad that…we’ve grown further apart and that **she** probably doesn’t see\[\] me as a daughter anymore.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

489    The relevant aspect of the Mother’s examination-in-chief read as follows:[\[note: 767\]](#Ftn_767)

> Q:    …So now moving on. \[The Complainant\] has given evidence that you have blocked her off on social media. What do you have to say about this?

> A:    To begin with, we have never added each other on social media because by right, she should not be having any.

> Q:    Alright. So never had any social media. Did you break any contact with her?

> A:    There was no contact that was broken but I remembered from May \[2017\] onwards, she started to message my sister to send her message to me.

> …

> Q:    So, she sends messages through your sister to you?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **And how do you contact her?**

> **A:**      **I was advised \[by the MCYS officer\] not to contact her. So, I would normally wait for her to contact me.**

> **Q:**      **…Did you break the relationship with \[the Complainant\]?**

> **A:**      **No, in fact the MCYS officer was trying to make our relationship better but however, I was advised, um, not to, uh, make the contact first and to wait for her.**

> Q:    Would you consider your relationship broken?

> A:    At this point, yes.

> Q:    So, when she sends messages to you through your sister…how do you respond or what is your response?

> A:    When the first time I received those messages from my sister, I did ask my sister, “Why did she send it to you and not to me straight?” And my sister was like, “I’m not too sure.” So, the subsequent ones, when she start sending, when my sister asked, “Do you want me to reply?” Then I was like, “This is not sincere. If she wants, she will have sent to me and not _via_ you.”

> Q:    What kinds of messages were they?

> A:    \[F\]irst she\[\] mentioned that she was sorry. Then there \[were\] some messages that she mentioned that she misses me and \[her Stepbrother\]. And then the last message was before the trial, she mentioned something, like, she seek my forgiveness in everything and she wish me and \[her Stepbrother\] the best.

> \[emphasis added\]

490    In response, DC submitted that “no weight should be given to the Prosecution’s submission that the \[Complainant\] had suffered psychological harm arising out of being estranged from \[the Mother\]”.[\[note: 768\]](#Ftn_768) DC noted that the Prosecution was “not framing the harm caused to the \[Complainant\] in respect of the acts set out in the 3 Charges, but in respect of \[the Complainant’s\] estrangement from \[the Mother\].”[^769] According to DC, this sought to impute blame on the accused for the Mother’s “independent and voluntary decision to testify against \[the Complainant\]”.[^770] In this regard, DC contended that it was “wrong” for the accused “to be prejudiced or blamed for \[the Complainant’s\] alleged estrangement from \[the Mother\] and \[the Mother’s\] decision to testify against her.” Acknowledging that this was “a most unfortunate state of affairs”, DC argued that it was nevertheless “not one that \[the accused\] should be blamed for” and “most certainly not a situation where \[the accused\] should face an uplift in sentence”.[^771] DC clarified that he was “not running the case that the Prosecution is precluded from submitting that the \[Complainant\] has suffered psychological trauma if a victim impact statement had not been tendered.” Rather, DC asserted that he was “simply highlighting the fact that the Prosecution has not adduced any evidence that would justify holding \[the accused\] culpable for the actions of \[the Mother\]”.[^772]

491    The Prosecution “took exception” to DC’s submission that it was imputing blame on the accused for the Defence’s litigation strategy to call the Mother as a Defence witness.[\[note: 773\]](#Ftn_773) According to the Prosecution, the “harm concerned in the present case is the emotional harm inflicted upon the \[Complainant\] as a result of her estrangement from \[the Mother\]”. The Prosecution pointed out that the Complainant “had testified at multiple junctures that she was very concerned about improving her relationship with \[the Mother\], and this was one of the chief reasons as to why she did not report the accused’s actions for fear of souring their relationship even further”. According to the Prosecution, the Complainant “herself expressed sadness about the state of affairs after she reported the accused’s actions, and about her view that \[the Mother\] “probably doesn’t see\[\] \[her\] as a daughter anymore”. The Mother, “by testifying that their mother-daughter relationship has been “broken”, confirms that the \[Complainant’s\] worst fears have come true, and confirms the breakdown of their relationship”.[^774] The Prosecution continued:[^775]

> While \[DC\] attempts to distance the accused from \[the Mother’s\] “independent and voluntary decision” to testify in his favour, it is undeniable that the accused \[had\], at the very least, acquiesced to this as part of his own litigation strategy. That aside, it bears reiterating that **the retributive principle in sentencing considers** **_two_** **broad factors: on the one hand, one considers the offender’s culpability, and on the other hand, the \[court\] has to consider the harm inflicted upon the \[Complainant\]: see** **_Soh Meiyun v Public Prosecutor_** **<span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 299</span> at \[48\]. It is undeniable that a by-product of the accused’s actions was the estrangement of the \[Complainant\] from \[the Mother\] – it is this harm rendered upon the \[Complainant\] that this Court should have regard to in determining the correct degree of retributive punishment**.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

492    As I had some difficulty understanding the Prosecution’s argument, I sought further submissions from parties. The Prosecution’s response, effectively a repeat of its earlier submissions[\[note: 776\]](#Ftn_776), was in the following terms:[^777]

> 7.    While there is no victim impact statement in the present case, it is humbly submitted that this \[court\] should have regard to the fact that the \[Complainant’s\] relationship with her own flesh and blood (i.e. \[the Mother\] has irretrievably broken down. As the High Court in _PP v NF_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 849</span> (“_NF_”) noted at \[52\], “it is axiomatic that the immediate as well as future impact of a crime on a victim is a relevant factor in the sentencing equation” (emphasis added), holding with approval that it is a “cardinal principle of sentencing that the court should take into account when considering the gravity of the offence and the appropriate sentence, the consequences to the victim”, as “one of the purposes of the criminal law is to assuage the feelings of victims” by inflicting an appropriate punishment (emphasis added).

> 8.    In this regard, \[the High Court in _NF_ had cited at \[48\] the following extract from the\] UK Sentencing Advisory Panel’s _Advice on the Sexual Offences Act 2003_ to the UK Sentencing Council…:

>> “The psychological trauma caused by sexual offences can be so deep-seated that it can have a permanent impact on a victim’s ability to function in society. This can particularly be the case where sexual violation has been perpetrated over a long period of time, especially where the perpetrator is a family member or a person in a position of trust. Existing personal relationships may break down and victims often find it extremely difficult to develop intimate relationships in the future.”

> 9    Accordingly, this Court is entitled to and should take into account the fact that the \[Complainant’s\] relationship with \[the Mother\] (which the \[Complainant\] was working towards repairing) has irretrievably broken down as a result of the accused’s offences. This is even more so considering the fact of the \[Complainant’s\] young age, which would exacerbate the harm and trauma inflicted upon her: see _NF_ at \[49\].

> 10.    In the present case, the \[Complainant\] was a member of the accused’s household, and enjoyed a position of trust and authority over the \[Complainant who\] …addressed the accused as “Encik””…While there is no direct evidence from the \[Complainant\] on whether she finds it difficult to develop intimate relationships in the future, the irrefutable fact of the matter is that as a result of her disclosure of the incident, \[her\] relationship with \[the Mother\] has irretrievably broken down and she has also testified that she feels sadness that \[the Mother\] probably does not see her as a daughter anymore…This should accordingly be taken into account…as an offence-specific aggravating factor.

493    DC maintained his initial position.[\[note: 778\]](#Ftn_778) He submitted that the court “should be slow in attributing the estranged relationship between the \[Complainant\] and \[the Mother\] to \[the accused\], given the lack of any objective evidence that would justify holding \[the accused\] liable for the actions of the \[Mother\].”[^779] Referring to the need for a “firm evidential basis for the determination of the extent of the damage that \[a\] crime has had on the victim”, DC argued that:[^780]

> (a)     the Prosecution has “not proven that the cause of the breakdown in the relationship between the \[Complainant\] and \[the Mother\] was directly caused by \[the accused’s\] offence\[s\]”. Rather, the evidence suggested that the breakdown in their relationship was “mainly due to the fact that the \[Mother\] had chosen to disbelieve the \[Complainant\].” According to DC, the Mother “made the voluntary decision to testify against the \[Complainant\] and explained her reasons for choosing to disbelieve the \[Complainant\].” The Mother’s evidence suggested that “she had formed her own considered view in choosing to disbelieve the \[Complainant\]”.

> (b)     there was “no evidence regarding the extent of how badly the relationship between the \[Complainant\] and \[the Mother\] had broken down” nor was there any “objective evidence” suggesting a “causal link” between the accused’s offences and the deterioration of the relationship between the Complainant and the Mother. DC noted that the Complainant’s evidence was that “prior to moving in to live with \[the Mother\], the \[Complainant\] and \[the Mother\] rarely communicated and that they were essentially like strangers.” DC also referred to the Complainant’s testimony that her relationship with the Mother was “still not close” even in the period after the accused’s offences.

494    In these circumstances, DC submitted that the estranged relationship between the Complainant and the Mother was “not something that \[the accused\] should be blamed for”. DC thus contended that it should not be considered as an offence-specific aggravating factor in this case.[\[note: 781\]](#Ftn_781)

495    I agreed with DC. It was not at all clear that the estrangement of the Complainant from the Mother was a “by-product of the accused’s actions”.[\[note: 782\]](#Ftn_782) Indeed, the Complainant’s testimony indicated that this arose from the Mother’s unilateral actions (of “blocking” her on social media and telling the Complainant’s maternal grandmother not to contact her anymore).[^783] These actions by the Mother might have happened after the Report was lodged. But, no evidence was adduced to show that it was the accused who was responsible for these actions by the Mother – which appeared, on the face of it, to have been independently and voluntarily performed by the Mother without any involvement by the accused. The Mother’s subsequent testimony, which was not challenged, also suggested that she had not contacted the Complainant because she had been advised by the relevant authorities not to do so (and it appeared to have been in this context that the Mother said that she considered her relationship with the Complainant “broken”).[^784] It was difficult to see how and why the accused should be blamed for this state of affairs.

496    I also had some difficulty appreciating why the “retributive principle of sentencing” justified “retributive punishment” on the accused for the estrangement of the Complainant and the Mother[\[note: 785\]](#Ftn_785) – when no evidence was adduced to show that it was the accused, and not the Mother (or anyone else), who was responsible for this. The “essence of the retributive principle” is that “the offender must pay for what he has done” (_PP v Tan Fook Sum_[^786]). Under the retributive principle, a sentence is imposed to reflect to degree of ham and culpability that has been occasioned by the offender’s wrongful conduct (_PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_[^787]). There is therefore a _direct_ connection between the retributive principle and the offender’s misconduct (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2019 at paras 06.017 and 06.023). The need for a direct connection between the retributive principle and the accused’s offending conduct is also evident from the following remarks of the High Court in _PP v V Murugesan_[^788]:

> 55     **Perpetrators are punished not just for the physical harm** **they** **inflict but also for the life-long trauma, debilitating emotional distress and anguish** **they** **callously and cruelly inflict and sentence their victims to suffer in silence.** In the circumstances, draconian sentences which primarily encapsulate the principles of both retribution and deterrence are ineluctably required and will be invariably meted out to all such offenders. Few, if any, right-minded people will complain about heavy-handed sentences in this genre of cases.

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

497    The Prosecution had cited _Soh Meiyun v PP_[\[note: 789\]](#Ftn_789) in support of its contention. But, a closer analysis of the relevant paragraphs in this decision show that the court was concerned with the harm inflicted on a victim as a _direct_ result of an offender’s offence:

> 46    Then there is retribution. The essence of it, as articulated by Yong Pung How CJ in _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[16\], is that “**the offender** **must pay for what** **he** **has done**”. Elaborating, Yong CJ said that the idea of retribution is that “**punishment restores the just order of society which has been disrupted by** **\[the offender’s\] crime**”, and hence punishment on retributive principles “must reflect and befit the seriousness of the crime…

> …

> 48    I would venture the following comments. **Two broad factors are key in determining the correct degree of retributive punishment. One relates to the victim and the other, the offender**. As regards the victim, one considers, perhaps among other things, his station in life and the extent of harm inflicted on him. The more vulnerable and disadvantaged the victim is, the greater the sense of abhorrence society feels when harm is visited on him; and the greater the harm, the more pronounced the abhorrence and the greater the punishment needed to restore the just order of society. **As regards the offender, one likewise considers his station in life, as well as his mental state when** **he** **inflicted harm on the victim.** The more privileged the offender is, the greater the sense of abhorrence that he should have harmed another; and as for his mental state, at one end of the scale is accidental behaviour, which generally excites no abhorrence and demands no punishment, while at the other end is a positive desire to cause severe harm which would represent the zenith of malice or cruelty. In this latter situation the abhorrence rises to the level of outrage. Now the broad rubrics of victim and offender might admit of more sub-factors, and there may yet be other matters to be taken into account. But even limiting the enquiry to those two broad factors, the exercise of balancing the interests is not one which is amenable to mathematical precision.

> 49    I return to the present case. The appellant \[offender\] is not a particularly privileged individual. As a child, she was the victim of physical abuse. She was suffering from the two psychiatric conditions. **From the medical evidence**, **she** **did not harm the victim out of cruelty or callousness. She was simply overwhelmed by the emotions generated by the disorders over which she had no control, and she was probably barely conscious of the fact that** **she** **was harming a human being.** The degree of abhorrence that arises from this is therefore not high. On the other hand, there is the victim. The Prosecution’s descriptions of her station in life were evocative – here is a person who, like many domestic maids, has no place of refuge to return to at the end of a working day, who has precious little time to herself, and who, by reason of financial hardship, may have had to grit her teeth and bear in silence difficult working conditions. The physical harm inflicted on the victim was not insignificant, and added to this was the emotional distress of constantly living in fear of further abuse. The abhorrence that this arouses is substantial. Looking at the matter in the round, therefore, I would say that the principle of retribution calls for a custodial sentence, albeit not a particularly lengthy one.

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

498    This was also the case in _PP v NF_[\[note: 790\]](#Ftn_790) (“_NF_”), where the court referred to the “the relevance and importance of the extent of the injury caused to the victim by an offender’s criminal act”.

499    The need for a direct connection between an offender’s offence and the harm that is inflicted on a victim is also evident from the definition of what constitutes “harm”. In this regard, “harm” has been defined to be the “measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of _the_ offence and it should be measured in terms of the magnitude of the infringement of the legally protected interests which are implicated” (_PP v Tan Thian Earn_[\[note: 791\]](#Ftn_791)). This is also reflected in the definition of a “victim impact statement” in s 228(7) of the CPC – namely, that it is a “statement relating to any harm suffered by any person as a direct result of an offence, which includes physical bodily harm or psychological or psychiatric harm.” As DC correctly noted, the Prosecution was not framing the harm caused to the Complainant in respect of the accused’s offending conduct (in relation to the Three Incidents), but in respect of the Complainant’s estrangement from the Mother.[^792] However, no evidence was adduced to show that the “emotional harm inflicted upon the \[Complainant\] as a result of her estrangement from \[the Mother\]”[^793] was a direct result of the accused’s offending conduct (for which he should be held accountable).[^794]

500    That said, I did take into account the following, which arose directly from the accused’s offending conduct:

> (a)     In relation to the Bedroom Incident, the Complainant’s testimony that she felt “scared” and “extremely uncomfortable” when the accused was groping her right breast for “a few minutes”.[\[note: 795\]](#Ftn_795) The Complainant had also testified that she was “scared” that the accused would “do something more worse” to her if she made a noise or tried to run away during this incident.[^796]

> (b)     The Complainant’s testimony that she felt “scared” and “very uncomfortable” during the Master Bedroom Incident. The Complainant had also testified that she was “scared” that the accused would “do something worse” to her if she called out for help.[\[note: 797\]](#Ftn_797)

> (c)     the Complainant’s testimony that:[\[note: 798\]](#Ftn_798)

>> (i)       she had eventually disclosed the accused’s conduct to her Stepmother because she had “felt very uncomfortable” not telling anyone about his conduct.

>> (ii)       she had told her Teacher that she was “molested” by the accused because she had been “really bothered” about the accused, and hoped that her Teacher could help her to be not “as uncomfortable as before”.

> (d)     the Stepmother’s testimony as to the Complainant’s emotional state when they met, and how the Complainant would cry whenever the Stepmother brought up the molest.[\[note: 799\]](#Ftn_799) The Stepmother had also testified in July 2019 that the Complainant would occasionally remark that she “know how it feels” whenever they watched a television programme or read a newspaper article about “children \[getting\] molested”.[^800]

(D)   Prior massages not relevant to sentencing

501    The Prosecution argued that the massages the accused had performed on the Complainant before the Bedroom Incident[\[note: 801\]](#Ftn_801) was “evidence of a sustained pattern of abuse” against the Complainant. According to the Prosecution, this “sustained pattern of abuse” would “rightfully factor into the inquiry on the degree of harm caused” to the Complainant, and “should be taken into account as an offence-specific aggravating factor in sentencing”.[^802]

502    In response, DC argued that “based on the \[Complainant’s\] own evidence”, these prior massages “were significantly less egregious and did not involve the touching of the \[Complainant’s\] breasts, but rather, specifically, “**under** \[her\] chest area **under** her left breast” and “**over her clothes**”. DC further argued that the Complainant had, in cross-examination, testified that the accused had “simply “slid\[\] his hands **under \[her\] chest**”.[\[note: 803\]](#Ftn_803) In these circumstances, DC submitted that these prior massages “did not involve the touching of the \[Complainant’s\] breasts \[and\] did not involve skin-to-skin contact”.[^804]

503    I agreed with DC’s submission. The Complainant never testified[\[note: 805\]](#Ftn_805) that the accused had put his hand _on_ or _over_ her breasts during these massages. There was therefore no intrusion with her private parts (her left breast and her right breast) during these massages. There was also no skin-to-skin contact with her left breast area or her right breast area as well as with the regions under these areas.

504    I was mindful that a “sentencing court can and should consider all relevant and proved facts if they bear a sufficient nexus to the offence \[the accused has been charged with\], such as those that form part of the immediate circumstances of the offence or those relevant to the offender’s culpability” (_GDC_ at \[32\]). That said, given the Complainant’s confirmation that she had “agree\[d\] to allow \[the accused\] to do these massages on \[her\]”[\[note: 806\]](#Ftn_806), it was difficult to say whether these prior massages could even have been the subject of criminal charges in the first place. I noted that the Complainant did say that she had agreed “at first” to these prior massages as she “thought… \[the accused\] was…just trying to help \[her\] make \[her\] body don’t feel as painful as before”. She then said she had “force\[d\] herself to agree” “after a few massages” because she was “scared” that the accused “might scold \[her\]”. But, she never testified as to which point (and after how many of these prior massages) she had “force\[d\] herself to agree”. In addition, these _prior_ massages could not be said to have formed part of the _immediate_ circumstances of the offences in relation to the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident (and the Complainant did not testify as well on the interval between the last of these prior massages and the Bedroom Incident). All said, it was not possible to say that these prior massages “could constitute…separate offence\[s\] \[and were\] so closely intertwined with the specific charge\[s\] before the court that \[they\] should be considered at sentencing” (_PP v Bong Sim Swan, Suzanna_[^807]).

##### (2)   Sentencing bands: Lower end of Band 2

505    Having ascertained the gravity of the offences underlying the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident, I placed them at the lower end of Band 2. I summarise the key aspects of the bands set out in _GBR_ on the following page.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="41.38%"><col width="58.62%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band description</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Band 1</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 12 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases at the lowest end of the spectrum of seriousness. This band includes cases which do not present any (or at most one) of the offence-specific aggravating factors, for example, those that involve a fleeting touch or a touch over the victim’s clothes, and do not involve an intrusion into the victim’s private parts. Caning is generally not imposed, although the possibility of caning is not excluded altogether (depending on the facts and circumstances of each case).</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Band 2</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 to 36 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases involving two or more of the offence-specific aggravating factors.

##### (3)   General aggravating & mitigating factors

506    The sentence that is ultimately imposed must also take into account aggravating and mitigating factors which relate to the offender generally, and which are not offence-specific.[\[note: 808\]](#Ftn_808)

(A)   Absence of antecedents neutral in sentencing

507    The accused did not plead guilty. He was thus ineligible for a sentencing discount. DC submitted that the fact that the accused was “untraced should be treated as a mitigating factor”.[\[note: 809\]](#Ftn_809) But, the absence of antecedents is no more than the absence of an aggravating factor. The accused’s lack of antecedents was hence not mitigating, but neutral, in the sentencing process (_BPH v PP_[^810]).

(B)   Claims against police/Prosecution showed no remorse

508    It is an aggravating factor where an offender displays an evident lack of remorse.[\[note: 811\]](#Ftn_811) Such a conclusion may be drawn if “the offender had conducted his defence in an extravagant and unnecessary manner, and particularly where scandalous allegations are made in respect of the victim”.[^812] On this note, the Prosecution argued that the accused’s defence highlighted his “lack of remorse”:[^813]

> i.    \[The Complainant\] had to relieve and recount distressing events and was even asked very personal questions such as by whom she gets scolded at home, and the reasons why, as well as irrelevant topics such as whether she had been discussing sexual matters with boys on social media.

> ii.    When \[the accused\] took the stand, the accused cast various character assassinations against the \[Complainant\] as follows \[which were never put to the Complainant when she took the stand\]:

>> 1.    That she has a “split personality”, and threatened to run away from home when she is 17.

>> 2.    That she was “getting out of control”.

>> 3.    Alleging that she was getting “more aggressive” towards the \[Helper\] and \[her Stepbrother\].

>> …

> iii.  The accused’s defence witness, _i.e._ the \[Mother\], repeated the same character assassinations against the \[Complainant (and delved further into embarrassing and personal details of the \[Complainant\]), when the \[Complainant\] had already left the stand. \[In this regard, the Prosecution pointed to the following two “notable examples”: the Mother’s claim that she had received feedback that the Complainant was out of control and that her grades were falling; and the Mother’s claim that the Complainant’s form teacher had called her to inform that the Complainant was having a breakdown in class and was being rude to her friends and teachers\].

509    The Prosecution also submitted that the “conduct of the accused in casting unwarranted aspersions against the Prosecution and the Police”[\[note: 814\]](#Ftn_814) pointed to his “evident lack of remorse”. It urged the court to consider “this conduct in attempting to sully the good name of the law enforcement agencies in Singapore with unwarranted allegations as an offender-specific aggravating factor”.[^815]

510    DC noted that the fact that the Complainant “had to relieve and recount distressing events”[\[note: 816\]](#Ftn_816) “inevitably” followed from the accused’s decision to claim trial. As the accused had already been “deprived of a sentencing discount” given his decision to claim trial[^817], I agreed with DC that this fact was not aggravating.[^818] I did not think that asking the Complainant “by whom she gets scolded at home”[^819] was a “very personal” question. In any event, I accepted DC’s submission that this question was “asked in good faith for the purposes of either establishing context or assessing \[the Complainant’s\] credibility”.[^820] I also accepted DC’s submission that the accused had “no control over” the Mother’s testimony. As such, no weight should be given to the Mother’s testimony in sentencing the accused.[^821] I noted the Prosecution’s response that the character assassinations of the Complainant were “ultimately still led” from the Mother by the Defence.[^822] But, it was not clear if the accused had indeed “accepted as part of his litigation strategy”[^823]_all_ of the allegations the Mother had levelled against the Complainant. It was never the Prosecution’s case that the accused had “colluded” with the Mother or had “tampered” with the Mother’s testimony.[^824] I also noted that the allegations levelled by the Mother against the Complainant were greater in number and more detailed than those made by the accused himself. I therefore agreed with DC that the accused should not be sentenced on the basis of the Mother’s testimony as well.

511    The accused did allege that the Complainant had threatened to “run away” when she turned 17. But, he also testified that the Mother had later addressed this issue with the Complainant. He did not further allege that the Mother had difficulty in doing so.[\[note: 825\]](#Ftn_825) The accused did testify that he had received feedback from family members that the Complainant had “a bit of a split personality”. But, he also explained what he meant by “split personality”. In this regard, he only alleged that the Complainant would seem “okay” in front of him and the Mother but she would inform other family members that she did not like her “routines” at the Flat.

512    The accused did claim that the Complainant had started staying in the Flat with the Mother (and him) from December 2014 because:[\[note: 826\]](#Ftn_826)

> (a)     the Mother and him had received “a lot of feedback” from family members that she was “getting out of control”.

> (b)     there was an incident where the Mother had apparently caught her “sending message to…a person discussing about sexual activity.

513    But, these assertions were made in relation to the Complainant’s purported conduct before December 2014. In any event, the accused testified that the Complainant became “more disciplined” thereafter – in that she became more religious; learnt “how to pray”; had “study routines”; and would “read books”.[\[note: 827\]](#Ftn_827) He further testified that the Complainant had improved in her studies as well.[^828]

514    The accused did allege that the Complainant was “a bit more aggressive” with the Helper and her Stepbrother in the second half of 2016. He had said this when responding to the Defence’s question on whether the Complainant had ever displayed the behaviour she allegedly displayed during the Sofa Incident (namely, looking “more tense”; becoming “very stiff”; looking at him in a “challenging” way; and not looking happy”).[\[note: 829\]](#Ftn_829) His testimony on the nature of the Complainant’s alleged aggression towards the Helper and her Stepbrother thus appeared to be limited to these somewhat trivial aspects.

515    In _Zeng Guoyuan v PP_[\[note: 830\]](#Ftn_830), the offender was convicted after a trial on multiple molestation charges. He had humiliated and badgered the victim during cross-examination and showed contemptuous disregard for the judge. On the issue of sentencing, the High Court made the following observations:

> 37    …\[A\]n accused is entitled to raise any type of defence necessary to his case, a scandalous – or even vexatious – defence notwithstanding. The scandalous nature of a defence, nevertheless, cannot be an unqualified excuse for an unbridled performance in the courtroom. Of course, the accused must also be given some degree of latitude in the manner in which he wishes to conduct his defence; and in the large majority of cases, a rebuke from the trial judge would be sufficient punishment. **In the case before me, however, the appellant showed a wholly exceptional contempt for the proceedings at hand. Indeed, he seemed most tenacious in his determination to humiliate the complainant.** When PW4 and the complainant adduced evidence of a test performed where the vibrator had fit beneath her clothes, he demanded that the complainant perform the test in open court. When the complainant had indicated, at his request, the area where pimples were present on her chest, he asked her to measure the distance between her nipples and the pimples with a ruler. Despite the fact that his defence was denial, he alleged that she was a “willing partner”. **During cross-examination, he badgered her so relentlessly that she cried on two occasions. Furthermore, his conduct toward the magistrate showed scant regard for the law. Time and again, he refused to answer direct questions from the court on the relevancy of his cross-examination tactics or to submit to judicial control of his courtroom antics.** In the middle of the trial, he arranged for an unknown person to tap the prosecuting officer’s shoulder and to leave the courtroom immediately thereafter. In response to the magistrate’s query as to the identity of the person, he replied that the person was a retired judge of the High Court whose presence was a great honour to the magistrate. **Upon being convicted, he interrupted the magistrate with his protestations of innocence, going so far as to make statements such as “you have done me a lot of injustice”, “there is no justice in the system” and “the law is blind”. Such behaviour could not but be taken as an aggravating consideration**.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

516    Against this backdrop, I did not think that the allegations made by the accused in relation to the Complainant “showed a wholly exceptional contempt for the proceedings at hand”. Neither was the accused “most tenacious in his determination to humiliate the \[Complainant\]”. These allegations were not of a particularly sensitive and personal nature, and they did not amount to an “extremely wicked” or “extremely malicious” attack on the Complainant’s character (_Seow Fook Thiam v PP_[\[note: 831\]](#Ftn_831)). It was difficult to say that the accused had, by virtue of these allegations, conducted his defence in an extravagant manner.[^832] It was also difficult to say that these allegations sought to disparage the character, integrity, or morality of the Complainant to shift blame to her for the offences (_Ng Jun Xian v PP_[^833]). All things considered, I did not think that these allegations by the accused[^834] warranted an enhancement in his sentence.

517    That said, I did consider, as aggravating, the baseless allegations levelled against the police and the Prosecution.[\[note: 835\]](#Ftn_835) I noted that DC did indicate that the accused was “unequivocally” withdrawing these allegations. DC also indicated that the accused was “unreservedly” apologising for these allegations.[^836] But, these apparent gestures of remorse were made only after I had asked parties to specifically address these allegations and their relation “to the factor of remorse and how I should calibrate the sentences in this case”.[^837] The accused’s belated indications in respect of these allegations (which he had personally confirmed were made on his instructions[^838]) was thus more tactical rather than arising from genuine remorse. I noted that these allegations were not made in the course of the trial proceedings (as they were made in written submissions after the close of trial). But, they nevertheless also led to some time and resources being wasted.[^839]

##### (4)   Sentencing precedents

518    Applying the _GBR_ framework, I had sentenced the accused as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.94%"><col width="25.02%"><col width="25.02%"><col width="25.02%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Prosecution</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>DC</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Court</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Bedroom Incident</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>19 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Master Bedroom Incident</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Not more than 8 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

519    In calibrating these sentences, I had particular regard to the following cases:

> (a)      _PP v ABO_ [\[note: 840\]](#Ftn_840) (“_ABO_”)

Some details of the five charges appear below:

521    The offender resided with the victim, the victim’s mother, and the victim’s three sisters in a flat. The flat had one bedroom, that was used by the victim’s mother and the offender. The victim and her sisters slept on individual mattresses in the living room of the flat.

522    On 9 July 2015, the victim reported to the police that the offender had “touched \[her\] private part”. Later that same day, the offender was requested by police officers to attend an interview. The offender admitted to molesting the victim and he was placed under arrest. Investigations revealed that the offender had played “wrestling” with the victim on one occasion and the victim had fallen on top of him. From that moment, he started to become sexually aroused by the victim. He soon started molesting the victim while she was asleep. He would initially use both of his hands to touch the victim’s vagina and buttocks outside her shorts while he masturbated and looked at the victim. He subsequently progressed to removing his and the victim’s trousers and underwear and rubbing his penis against the victim’s vagina. The offender had molested the victim on many occasions from November 2014 to May 2015, and he informed the police that he had lost count of the number of times he had molested the victim.

523    In relation to the first proceeded charge (for which the offender’s sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was enhanced to **18 months’ imprisonment** on appeal), the offender had trouble sleeping on one occasion at night in November 2014. He walked out of his bedroom and into the living room, where the victim was sleeping with her sisters. He saw that the victim was sleeping soundly and developed an urge to touch her. He thus walked over to her side and bent down. He then used both of his hands to touch the victim’s vagina and buttocks over the pair of shorts she was wearing. The offender’s penis was erect, and he pulled down his trousers and used one of his hands to masturbate while using his other hand to touch the victim. As the victim felt someone was touching her vagina, she woke up and saw the offender touching her. The victim was frightened and did not know what to do. She did not dare to shout and turned her body away from the offender. The victim was frightened and outraged by the offender’s actions.

524    In relation to the second proceeded charge (for which the offender’s sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment was enhanced to **21 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane** on appeal), the offender had trouble sleeping on another occasion at night in November 2014. He walked out of his bedroom and into the living room, where the victim was sleeping with her sisters. He saw that the victim was sleeping soundly and developed an urge to touch her. He thus walked over to her side and bent down. He then used both of his hands to touch her vagina outside the pair of shorts she was wearing. His penis was erect, and he pulled down his trousers and used one of his hands to masturbate while using his other hand to touch the victim. The offender then rubbed his penis against the victim’s vagina, over the pair of shorts she was wearing. As the victim felt someone touching her vagina, she woke up and saw the offender touching her. She turned her body away from him. He stopped touching her and walked back to his bedroom. The victim was frightened and outraged by the offender’s actions.

525    In _GBR_, the court noted that the first and second proceeded charges in _ABO_ were at the “lower end” of Band 2 as there was “an absence of skin-to-skin contact with the private parts of the victim”.[\[note: 844\]](#Ftn_844)

526    In relation to the third proceeded charge (for which the offender was sentenced to **24 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane**), the offender had brought the victim along with him to deliver food on a day between November 2014 and May 2015. He was driving a lorry assigned to him by his employer. After completing his deliveries, he drove the lorry and parked it along a road. During the journey, the victim, who was seated at the front passenger seat of the lorry, fell asleep. When the offender parked the lorry along the road, he told the victim to go to the back of the lorry and sleep there. The victim obeyed the offender and proceeded to the back of the lorry to sleep. The offender later joined the victim and lay next to her. While the victim was asleep, he pulled down her trousers and panties. He then pulled down his trousers and underwear and rubbed his erect and exposed penis against the victim’s exposed vagina. The victim felt someone touching her vagina and woke up. It was dark at the back of the lorry, and she panicked. She saw the offender and started screaming. She quickly pulled up her trousers and told the offender that she wanted to return home. She was very frightened by the offender’s actions. This charge was noted in _GBR_ to be an example of a case at the “higher end” of Band 2 – as it involved “the skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts or sexual organs”.[\[note: 845\]](#Ftn_845)

527    In respect of all the proceeded charges, the District Court took into account the following aggravating factors:[\[note: 846\]](#Ftn_846)

> (a)     “that the \[offender\], being the stepfather, had abused his position of trust in committing the offences against a young victim”.

> (b)     that the offences were “committed over a period of several months”.

> (c)     that the offender’s acts were “lewd”.

> (d)     that the “private parts of the victim had been violated”.

> (e)     the two charges that were considered in sentencing.

528    The District Court considered that the first and second proceeded charges “were less aggravated \[than the third proceeded charge\] and did not involve skin-to-skin contact”.[\[note: 847\]](#Ftn_847) As for the third proceeded charge, the District Court considered that it was “the most serious and intrusive of the three proceeded charges \[as\] there was skin-to-skin contact”.[^848]

529    The District Court took into account the fact that the offender had “come clean \[on\] the very day that the case was reported to the police”.[\[note: 849\]](#Ftn_849) Noting that the offender’s “remorse was demonstrably clear”, the District Court ordered the longest sentence of imprisonment (imposed for the third proceeded charge) to run consecutively with the shortest sentence of imprisonment (imposed for the first proceeded charge). This led to a total sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. On appeal by the Prosecution[^850], the High Court enhanced the sentences for the first and second proceeded charges. It also ordered the sentences for the second and third proceeded charges to run consecutively, to give a total sentence of **45 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane**.

530    I was mindful that unlike the accused, the offender in _ABO_ had pleaded guilty and was hence entitled to a sentencing discount. That said, I noted that the Bedroom Incident (as well as the Master Bedroom Incident) was less serious than the offence underlying the third proceeded charge in _ABO_ (for which a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was imposed). As such, to impose an identical sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for the Bedroom Incident (as was the Prosecution’s submission) would have been excessive. This was in light of the fact that:[\[note: 851\]](#Ftn_851)

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation in relation to the third proceeded charge in _ABO_ was greater than that during the Bedroom Incident.

> (b)     there was some premeditation on the part of the offender in _ABO_.

> (c)     the victim in _ABO_ was three years younger than the Complainant.

> (d)     there were two charges considered in sentencing in _ABO_.

531    A sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for the Bedroom Incident (the sentence imposed in relation to the second proceeded charge in _ABO_) was also excessive in light of the fact that:

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation in relation to the second proceeded charge in _ABO_ was greater than that during the Bedroom Incident.

> (b)     the victim in _ABO_ was three years younger than the Complainant.

> (c)     there were two charges considered in sentencing in _ABO_.

532    To my mind, a sentence of 19 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was more appropriate for the Bedroom Incident. In terms of imprisonment, this was a month more than that imposed in relation to the first proceeded charge in _ABO_. I was mindful that:

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation in relation to the first proceeded charge in _ABO_ was greater than that during the Bedroom Incident.

> (b)     the victim in _ABO_ was three years younger than the Complainant.

> (c)     there were two charges considered in sentencing in _ABO_.

533    But, unlike the offender in _ABO_, the accused had not pleaded guilty. He was thus not entitled to a sentencing discount. He had also levelled serious allegations against the police and the Prosecution, which showed a lack of remorse. In addition, there was some evidence that the harm inflicted on the Complainant extended beyond the immediate circumstances of the offence[\[note: 852\]](#Ftn_852) (unlike _ABO_, where the statement of facts referred only to the distress caused to the victim immediately after the offence).

534    I noted that the offender in _ABO_ was not sentenced to caning in relation to the first proceeded charge. That said, I was cognisant that _GBR_ had adopted the principle in _PP v Chow Yee Sze_[\[note: 853\]](#Ftn_853) that “the starting point is that caning will be imposed where a victim’s private parts or sexual organs are intruded upon”.[^854] This was the case during the Bedroom Incident, where the accused had intruded upon the Complainant’s right breast for “a few minutes”.

535    As for the Master Bedroom Incident, I was of the view that a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was appropriate. In terms of imprisonment, this was identical to that imposed in relation to the first proceeded charge in _ABO_. As with the Bedroom Incident[\[note: 855\]](#Ftn_855), I was mindful that:

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation in relation to the first proceeded charge in _ABO_ was greater than that during the Master Bedroom Incident.

> (b)     the victim in _ABO_ was three years younger than the Complainant.

> (c)     there were two charges considered in sentencing in _ABO_.

536    However, unlike the offender in _ABO_, the accused had not pleaded guilty. He was thus not entitled to a sentencing discount. He had also levelled serious allegations against the police and the Prosecution, which showed a lack of remorse. In addition, there was some evidence that the harm inflicted on the Complainant extended beyond the immediate circumstances of the offences[\[note: 856\]](#Ftn_856) (unlike _ABO_, where the statement of facts referred only to the distress caused to the victim during the commission of the offence). The accused had further used force on the Complainant, when he grabbed her arm and pulled/dragged her into the master bedroom.[^857] His conduct during the Master Bedroom Incident was also brazen.[^858]

537    While the offender in _ABO_ was not sentenced to caning in relation to the first proceeded charge, _GBR_ held that caning “will nearly always be imposed” where “two or more aggravating factors present themselves”.[\[note: 859\]](#Ftn_859) This was the case in relation to the Master Bedroom Incident, notwithstanding the absence of intrusion into the Complainant’s private parts. I therefore imposed the “suggested starting point” of three strokes of the cane. In this regard, I was also mindful of _GCO v PP_[^860] (“_GCO_”) where the High Court observed at \[94\] (albeit in relation to offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code) that caning has “typically been imposed on offenders in cases…where…there was an element of restraint applied to the victim…\[or where there is an\] abuse of trust”.

(B)    _GBJ_

538     _GBJ_ was decided at first instance and considered on appeal before _GBR_. But, it was referred to with approval in _GBR_ and identified as a case at the lower end of Band 2.[\[note: 861\]](#Ftn_861)

539    The offender in _GBJ_ had claimed trial to a single charge for molesting his 11-year-old daughter in the flat they lived in. The victim had returned to the flat after school. She saw the offender sniffing glue in the bedroom. He was then sitting at the bottom edge of the bed and facing the television (which was switched off) that was in the bedroom. The offender was shirtless and wearing a pair of shorts. He called out to the victim and asked her to sit beside him. He then turned on the television and showed her a pornographic film. The victim felt uncomfortable and averted her gaze from the television. The offender then lay on the bed and asked the victim to sit beside him. The victim complied and sat on the right side of the bed. The offender then reached out and used his right hand to rub the victim’s left breast in a circular motion over her clothes. The victim testified that she felt scared and worried when the offender started touching her. The offender then kissed her on her left eyebrow. He later pulled her shoulder such that she was lying with her head on his stomach. He then unfastened the Velcro fastener on his shorts. When the victim heard the offender unfastening his shorts, she panicked and became afraid that something worse would happen. She therefore walked out of the bedroom and went to the common corridor where she pretended to re-arrange the shoes at the shoe rack. She wanted to run away immediately, but she was afraid that the offender would stop her. The offender also left the bedroom and went to the gate of the flat. There, he pulled the victim by the arm and asked her to go inside the flat. The victim told him that she did not want to go inside the flat and asked him to do so first. As the offender walked back into the bedroom, the victim took her slippers in her hands and ran to another block of flats. She then called the police using a public phone and reported that the offender had “wanted to molest \[her\]”. After calling the police, she went up to level 2 of the block of flats where she sat on a staircase. She felt very scared, and she cried.[\[note: 862\]](#Ftn_862)

540    In sentencing the offender to **18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane** (a sentence that was affirmed by the High Court[\[note: 863\]](#Ftn_863)), the District Court took into account the following aggravating factors:[^864]

> (a)     the victim was only 11 years old at the time of the offence.

> (b)     the offender was the victim’s biological father, and there was a “severe abuse of trust and authority…given the close father-daughter relationship that existed”.

> (c)     the offence caused the victim psychological harm – she “started slashing her arms for almost three years after the incident”.

> (d)     the offender’s “cavalier and callous” attempts to assassinate the characters of the victim (by alleging that she was a habitual liar) and her mother (who was called by the Prosecution as a witness) “showed a singular lack of remorse” on his part.

> (e)     the offender had showed the victim a pornographic film before outraging her modesty.

541    I was mindful that:[\[note: 865\]](#Ftn_865)

> (a)     the victim in _GBJ_ was two years younger than the Complainant.

> (b)     the degree of abuse of trust in _GBJ_ was greater, as the victim and the offender in _GBJ_ were noted to have a close father-daughter relationship.

> (c)     the psychological harm inflicted on the victim in _GBJ_ was greater than that inflicted by the accused on the Complainant (based on the evidence adduced before this court).

> (d)     unlike the offender in _GBJ_, the accused had not shown the Complainant a pornographic film before outraging her modesty.

542    As with the offender in _GBJ_, the accusations levelled by the accused against the police and the Prosecution showed a lack of remorse. More specifically:

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation during the Bedroom Incident was greater than that in _ABO_. The offender in _ABO_ had used his right hand to rub the victim’s left breast in a circular motion over her clothes for what appeared to be a short time. In contrast, the accused had groped the Complainant’s right breast from outside her bra for “a few minutes” while his hand was _still_ under her T-shirt. He had also made skin-to-skin contact with the Complainant’s calves (which he caressed with his right leg) and her tummy (which he stroked with his right hand after sliding his hand under the Complainant’s T-shirt). He had also molested the Complainant in her own bedroom and displayed a significant degree of opportunism in doing so. In these circumstances, I was of the view that a sentence marginally higher than that in _GBJ_ was justified for the Bedroom Incident. The sentence of 19 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for the Bedroom Incident was thus a month higher than that in _GBJ_.

> (b)     I noted that the degree of sexual exploitation during the Master Bedroom Incident was lesser than that in _GBJ_. That said, unlike the offender in _GBJ_, the accused had used force on the Complainant when he grabbed her arm and pulled/dragged her into the master bedroom.[\[note: 866\]](#Ftn_866) His conduct during the Master Bedroom Incident was also brazen.[^867] In these circumstances, I was of the view that a sentence identical to that in _GBJ_ – 18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was justified for the Master Bedroom Incident.

(C)    _GBR_

543     _GBR_ involved acts by an uncle against his niece, who was then 13 years old. The offender had claimed trial to a charge for “fondling both of \[the victim’s\] breasts”; “touching her vagina area”; and “licking her vagina area”.

544    The day before the offence (9 February 2014), the victim’s parents were embroiled in a domestic dispute. The offender and his wife (the victim’s maternal aunt) went to the victim’s residence that evening to try to mediate the dispute and did so until the early hours of the morning.

545    The victim did not go to school the following day (10 February 2014). That afternoon, the offender brought the victim to his flat on the pretext that it would be more conducive for her to do her schoolwork there (he had offered to take the victim back to his flat and away from the tense situation at home so that she could study better, and the victim’s mother had agreed[\[note: 868\]](#Ftn_868)). The offender was alone with the victim as his wife had gone to work.[^869] The victim was seated next to the offender on the sofa in the living room of his flat and studying at the time of the offence. The offender then started asking her if he could touch her and she said no. The victim could sense that the offender was angry, and she became very afraid.[^870] Despite her refusal, the offender proceeded to insert his hands under her T-shirt and bra and fondled her breasts for what felt like five minutes. The victim initially wanted to get his hands off her by “swing\[ing\] away”, but she was unable to do so. The offender then removed the victim’s shorts and panties. The victim did not stop him because she was afraid that he might hit her. The offender lifted her feet off the floor and onto the sofa. He knelt on the floor facing her and touched and rubbed her vagina. He then proceeded to lick her vagina for another five minutes.

546    The offender only stopped his acts when his mobile phone rang, and he went into his bedroom to receive the call.[\[note: 871\]](#Ftn_871) The victim took the opportunity to pick up her clothes and went to the toilet. There, she washed herself up before putting on her clothes. She said she felt disgusted and did not know what to do. She also testified that she “couldn’t…actually believe” that “this thing \[had\] happened” and that she was “very broken down” and her heart was “beating extremely fast”.[^872]

547    The victim did not want any more contact with the offender and she thus blocked his phone number on WhatsApp and Facebook. However, the offender confronted the victim the following day (11 February 2014) and made her unblock his phone number. The victim complied but blocked him again as soon as he had left. Two days later, on 13 February 2014, the offender visited the victim against at her flat. He told the victim’s mother that he would take the victim to the supermarket to buy her ice-cream. The accused took the victim out alone to the vicinity of the supermarket and spoke to her. He told her that he would “do whatever he did in a more professional way and…he would be naked”. He also said that he would “ask her to suck his private part the next time”.[\[note: 873\]](#Ftn_873)

548    In enhancing the offender’s sentence from 21 months’ imprisonment (and 4 strokes of the cane) to **25 months’ imprisonment (and 4 strokes of the cane)**, the High Court observed as follows:[\[note: 874\]](#Ftn_874)

> (a)     In fondling the victim’s breasts for about five minutes, and then touching and licking her vagina for another five minutes, there was “skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts and sexual exploitation \[which\] lasted for a substantial period”.

> (b)     There was “a degree of premeditation on the part of the \[offender\], because he capitalised on the victim’s parents’ domestic dispute the night before the offence and purported to offer the victim a more conducive space for studying, knowing that they would be alone in the flat”.

> (c)     There was an “abuse of position of trust in a familial context \[given that the offender\] was the victim’s uncle”.[\[note: 875\]](#Ftn_875) The victim had testified that she did not immediately tell her parents or her aunt about the offender’s conduct because she feared that they would not believe her. This underscored “the very real concern that the courts have over the difficulty of detection of such cases and, consequently, the view that general deterrence must feature prominently in the sentencing equation”.

> (d)     The victim had “suffered psychologically”. In this regard, there was a report from a psychiatrist that stated that the victim “experienced distress and self-harm tendencies. She \[also\] had difficulties concentrating on her studies, felt dirty, and had nightmares and flashbacks of the \[offence\]”.[\[note: 876\]](#Ftn_876)

> (e)     The offender had not pleaded guilty and was thus not entitled to a sentencing discount.

> (f)     The offender did not show “any semblance of remorse for his conduct”. Instead, he disparaged the victim’s character and imputed various fabricated motives to her for allegedly framing him.[\[note: 877\]](#Ftn_877)

549    To my mind, the Prosecution’s submission of 24 months’ imprisonment (and 3 strokes of the cane) for the Bedroom Incident[\[note: 878\]](#Ftn_878) – just _one_ month less than that imposed in _GBR –_ was excessive. I was mindful that the offender in _GBR_ had molested the victim in his flat. In contrast, the accused had molested the Complainant in the Flat during the Bedroom Incident (and the Master Bedroom Incident). The Flat had been the Complainant’s home for much of the period between December 2014 and 17 January 2017 – and should have been a safe sanctuary for her (_PP v BLV_[^879]). More egregiously, the accused had molested the Complainant in her very own bedroom during the Bedroom Incident. That said, the rest of the facts in _GBR_ meant that _GBR_ was clearly more aggravated than the facts in relation to the Bedroom Incident (and the Master Bedroom Incident). This was especially in light of the fact that:[^880]

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation during the Bedroom Incident was less than that in _GBR_.

> (b)     unlike the offender in _GBR_, there was no premeditation on the part of the accused in relation to the Bedroom Incident but a “significant degree of opportunism”.

> (c)     while there was an abuse of a position of trust in both _GBR_ and the instant case, the degree of abuse of trust in _GBR_ was greater. The victim in _GBR_ had testified that apart from her parents, she was “close to the accused and his wife and treated them like her own parents”. She had also said that she was, in some ways, closer to the accused than \[to\] her own father \[as\] she could speak freely with the accused” (and “feared her father who was a strict disciplinarian”).[\[note: 881\]](#Ftn_881) In contrast, it was the Complainant’s consistent testimony that she was never close to the accused.

> (d)     the psychological harm inflicted by the offender on the victim in _GBR_ immediately after the offence and thereafter was much greater than that inflicted by the accused on the Complainant (based on the evidence adduced before this court).

> (e)     the offender in _GBR_ had visited and spoken to the victim after the offence, and intimated that he would perform further acts of molest on her (including getting her to “suck his private part”).[\[note: 882\]](#Ftn_882)

(D)    _GBV_

550     _GBV_ was decided at first instance before _GBR_. That said, the High Court applied _GBR_ when enhancing the sentences on the offender.[\[note: 883\]](#Ftn_883)_GBV_[^884] involved acts by a stepfather against his 9-year-old stepdaughter. The offender pleaded guilty to two charges for offences that were committed on the same night. The victim was staying with her godmother’s family, but would see her mother on Thursdays when her mother fetched her from the student care centre. She would then stay with her mother and the offender until the next day, when her mother would bring her back to her godmother’s residence. Prior to the commission of the offences, the victim shared a close relationship with the offender and she regarded him as her real father. The offender would buy toys for her and play with her. He supported the victim financially. He also took on the disciplinarian role in the family and would scold the victim if she misbehaved.

551    In relation to the first charge (for which the offender’s sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and 1 stroke of the cane was enhanced to **15 months’ imprisonment and 1 stroke of the cane** on appeal), the victim’s mother had brought her back to her house as she was not working that day. After preparing dinner for the family, the victim’s mother had proceeded to take a shower, leaving the victim alone with the offender. At that point in time, the victim was drying her hair in one of the rooms. The offender then approached her and asked in a whisper whether her could dry her hair for her. The victim agreed. While the offender was drying the victim’s hair, the offender reached out with his hand and rubbed both of her breasts over her clothes in a circular motion for about 10 seconds. The victim was so shocked at what the accused was doing to her that she kept quiet.

552    In relation to the second charge (for which the offender’s sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane was enhanced to **20 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane** on appeal), after rubbing the victim’s breasts, the offender asked her in a whisper if he could touch her “private part”. Even though the victim said no, the offender proceeded to rub her vagina over her clothes in a circular motion. He only stopped after the victim had pushed his hand away. He then told the victim not to tell her mother about what he had done.

553    That same night, the victim’s mother walked her back to her godmother’s home. Along the way, the victim informed her mother about what the offender had done. The victim’s mother was shocked that the offender would do such a thing to her daughter. After the victim’s mother returned to her home, she confronted the offender. The offender did not deny the allegations, and he told the victim’s mother that he was very sorry for what he had done.

554    Later that same night, the victim’s godmother noticed that she was crying during her bedtime. When she asked the victim why she was crying, the victim said that she was feeling scared and could not sleep because the offender had touched her breasts and vagina. The victim’s godmother was shocked to hear this, and quickly informed the victim’s mother. The victim’s mother told the victim’s godmother that she (the victim’s mother) would handle the matter. The victim later informed the police that she felt scared when the offender rubbed her breasts and vagina, and that she hated the offender for doing so.

555    The High Court noted that the offences underlying both charges fell within Band 2 of the _GBR_ framework – given the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     the victim was extremely young, being just 9 years old at the time of the offences.

> (b)     the victim was the offender’s stepdaughter, and she viewed the offender as her real father.

> (c)     the nature of the offender’s assault entailed the private parts of the victim, including her vagina.

> (d)     there was a degree of surreptitiousness in the way the offender went about the assault by waiting until the mother was in the shower, offering to dry the victim’s hair, speaking to her in a whisper, and subsequently telling her not to tell the mother about the incident.

> (e)     the victim suffered psychological harm as she was crying on the night of the assault and could not sleep because of it.

556    That said, the High Court noted that the offender had cooperated with the authorities. He had not denied the acts when confronted by the victim’s mother, and he had also indicated his intention to plead guilty at the outset.

557    In relation to the first charge, the High Court noted that the starting point would have been a term of imprisonment of around 18 months. The High Court observed that the offence underlying this charge was less serious than that in relation to the second charge as: it was less intrusive in that it did not involve the victim’s vagina but her chest; and there was no resistance unlike the case with the second charge. On account of the offender’s plea of guilt, the High Court reduced the starting point of 18 months’ imprisonment to **15 months’ imprisonment** (the sentence of **1 stroke of the cane** that was imposed was not disturbed).

558    In relation to the second charge, the High Court noted that the starting point would have been a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. The offence underlying this charge was more serious as it involved the rubbing of the victim’s vagina. There was also resistance on the part of the victim. On account of the offender’s plea of guilt, the High Court reduced the starting point of 24 months’ imprisonment to **20 months’ imprisonment**. The number of strokes of the cane was also enhanced from 2 strokes to **3 strokes of the cane**.

559    Both of the enhanced sentences were ordered to run concurrently. This led to a **total sentence** of **20 months’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane**.

560    I noted the following general differences between _GBV_ and the instant case:

> (a)     The victim in _GBV_ was four years younger than the Complainant.

> (b)     While there was an abuse of a position of trust in both _GBV_ and the instant case, the degree of trust that was abused in _GBV_ was greater. This was because the victim in _GBV_ shared a close relationship with the offender and regarded him as her real father. In contrast, it was the Complainant’s consistent testimony that she was never close to the accused.

> (c)     While the psychological trauma suffered by the victim in _GBV_ and the Complainant appeared somewhat comparable (based on the evidence that was adduced in each instance), the victim in _GBV_ was only 9 years old. In this regard, the harm occasioned by the sexual assaults on the victim in _GBV_ was exacerbated in light of the victim’s more “immature system of psychological defences” (_NF_ at \[49\]).

561    That said, I was also mindful that the offender in _GBV_ had cooperated with the authorities. He had also not denied the acts when confronted by the victim’s mother. Indeed, he had indicated his intention to plead guilty at the outset and did, in fact, plead guilty. In contrast, the accused had claimed trial. He was thus not entitled to a sentencing discount. He had also levelled serious allegations against the police and the Prosecution, which showed a lack of remorse.

562    In addition, the degree of sexual exploitation during the Bedroom Incident was greater than that in relation to the first charge in _GBV_. There was not that same degree of surreptitiousness in the Bedroom Incident as in _GBV_, but the accused had nevertheless displayed a significant degree of opportunism during this incident.

563    As for the degree of sexual exploitation during the Master Bedroom Incident, I noted that it was less than that in relation to the first charge in _GBV._ That said, the accused had used force on the Complainant when he grabbed her arm and pulled/dragged her into the master bedroom. His conduct during the Master Bedroom Incident was also brazen.

564    All things considered, I was of the view that the imprisonment sentences for the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident should be pegged somewhere between the sentences imposed for the first charge and the second charge in _GBV_. In this regard, I noted that neither the Bedroom Incident nor the Master Bedroom Incident had involved an intrusion upon the Complainant’s vagina (as it did in relation to the victim in _GBV_, with respect to the second charge).

(E)    _GDC_

565    The facts in _GDC_ have been set out above.[\[note: 885\]](#Ftn_885) There, a sentence of **24 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane** was imposed on appeal. In doing so, the High Court referred to the following aggravating factors:[^886]

> (a)     There was a high degree of sexual exploitation, involving forceful skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s breast for about a minute.

> (b)     The offender had forcefully pulled the victim’s hair and brought her face close to his groin three to four times (though there was no clear evidence that his penis was exposed).

> (c)     There was an abuse of trust and authority, given that the offender was a father figure who had known the victim since she was young, and the abuse was committed within the family home.

> (d)     These was psychological harm caused to the victim, who had developed a fear of men.

> (e)     The offender had slapped the victim twice.

> (f)     The offender’s antecedents reflected a history of domestic abuse against the victim’s family, including an incident involving a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the victim’s mother – that was committed just days before the present offence. The commission of the offence against the victim therefore “reflected an escalation in severity of acts of domestic abuse”.

566    To my mind, the Prosecution’s submission of 24 months’ imprisonment (and 3 strokes of the cane) for the Bedroom Incident – an identical term of imprisonment to that imposed in _GDC –_ was excessive. The facts in _GDC_ were clearly more aggravated than the facts in relation to the Bedroom Incident (and the Master Bedroom Incident). This was especially in light of the fact that:

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation during the Bedroom Incident was less than that in _GDC_.

> (b)     the offender in _GDC_ had used force and violence against the victim.

> (c)     unlike the accused (who had no antecedents), the offender in _GDX_ had antecedents which reflected a history of domestic abuse against the victim’s family. Indeed, the commission of the offence against the victim “reflected an escalation in severity of acts of domestic abuse”.

(F)    _GDX_

567    The offender in _GDX_ claimed trial to three charges. Each charge related to an instance where he had molested one of his three stepdaughters in the family home. One of his stepdaughters was aged between 11 and 12 at the time of the offence, and the offence was hence punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. The other two stepdaughters were aged between 13 and 15 years of age at the time of the remaining two offences, and the relevant charges were framed under s 354(1) of the Penal Code.

568    Some details of these charges appear in the table below (as the offender was past 50 years of age, he could not be caned):

569    The charge punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code related to the offender’s youngest stepdaughter. She would address the offender as “Ah Pa”, which meant “father”. On one afternoon between 2014 and 2015, she was alone in her bedroom and lying on her bed when the offender came and lay beside her. The bedroom door was partially open at this time. She had been using her mobile phone when she noticed the offender’s presence behind her. The offender then placed his hand across her body to grab her left breast. He then moved his thumb in an upward and downward motion on her breast, over her clothes. Although she was not able to keep track of how long the touching lasted, she described that it felt long to her and estimated that it would have lasted for about a minute. She testified that she felt nervous and did not know what to do when the offender touched her breast. She therefore pretended not to notice his presence and continued using her mobile phone. She did not tell the offender to stop as she was scared. She was also worried that the offender and her mother (who had just got married) would split up and her mother would be sad. Following this incident, she kept her distance from the offender and tried to forget that it had occurred. She remained fearful of the offender and described that the incident was “like a trauma” as she dreamt of the offender opening the door on her while she was changing in her room.[\[note: 887\]](#Ftn_887)

570    In imposing a sentence of **16 months’ imprisonment** for this offence, the District Court took into account the following factors:[\[note: 888\]](#Ftn_888)

> (a)     as the victims’ stepfather, the offender had committed “a very egregious breach of trust”. While these offences had occurred early in the offender’s marriage to the victims’ mother, the victims (who were previously resident in Malaysia) were in a vulnerable state as they had just been brought into a totally new environment in Singapore with a newly formed family nucleus. The victims were in a very dependent relationship in relation to the offender. They looked to him to provide a roof over their heads as their new father. The offender had a role in them obtaining a place in their schools in Singapore as well as in applying for their permanent residency in Singapore. It would therefore have been very difficult for the victims to expose the offender should be commit any wrongdoing on them.

> (b)     All three victims were very young at the time of the offences. Two of the offender’s stepdaughters were just above the minimum age of 14 when the relevant offences were committed against them. That said, the court placed less weight on the age of the offender’s youngest stepdaughter as the offender had already been charged with an aggravated form of molest in respect of this stepdaughter.

> (c)     While there was no skin-to-skin contact, there was an intrusion of the victims’ private parts (their breasts) in each instance. The offender had specifically targeted their breasts and his contact with their breasts in each case was “not merely a fleeting touch”.

> (d)     The victims had all suffered psychological harm.

> (e)     The offender did cease his offending behaviour and played his part as caregiver to his three stepdaughters “to a reasonable extent by buying food and giving \[them\] pocket money”. The offender had also bailed one of his stepdaughters one and helped all three of them obtain permanent residency in 2018.

571    But for the fact that the offender was exempted from caning, the District Court noted that it would have also imposed 3 strokes of the cane for the offence punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code.[\[note: 889\]](#Ftn_889)

572    The District Court ordered all three sentences to run consecutively, to give a total sentence of 38 months’ imprisonment. It was of the view that this sentence was “slightly on the high side” given the “mitigating circumstances”. Taking into account the offender’s age and the fact that “this would be the first time he has been convicted of an offence and experience\[d\] prison time”, the court calibrated the sentences for the offences punishable under s 354(1) of the Penal Code downwards to 9 months’ imprisonment; and calibrated the sentence for the offence punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code downwards to 14 months’ imprisonment. The eventual sentence that was imposed on the offender was therefore **32 months’ imprisonment** (and 18 weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of 9 strokes of the cane).[\[note: 890\]](#Ftn_890)

573    The offender’s appeal against the sentences was dismissed.[\[note: 891\]](#Ftn_891) The High Court noted that the total sentence was “certainly not manifestly excessive”. That said, it observed that “\[i\]f anything, the \[total\] sentence was somewhat lenient having regard to the aggravating factors such as the abuse of trust (_vis-à-vis_ the familial relationship), the age of the \[offender’s two older stepdaughters\], the intrusion of private parts, and the psychological harm suffered by the victims”.[^892]

574    I was mindful that:

> (a)     the offender’s youngest stepdaughter in _GDX_ was one to two years younger than the Complainant.

> (b)     the degree of abuse of trust in _GDX_ was greater than that in _GDX_.

575    That said, the degree of sexual exploitation in relation to the Bedroom Incident was greater than that in relation to the youngest stepdaughter in _GDX_. The accused had also levelled serious allegations against the police and the Prosecution, which showed a lack of remorse.

576    The degree of sexual exploitation in relation to the Master Bedroom Incident was lesser than that in relation to the youngest stepdaughter in _GDX_. But, unlike the offender in _GDX_, the accused had used force on the Complainant, when he grabbed her arm and pulled/dragged her into the master bedroom. His conduct during the Master Bedroom Incident was also brazen.

577    In these circumstances, I was of the view that a sentence marginally higher than that imposed in _GDX_ in relation to the youngest stepdaughter was justified for the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident.

#### Sentence for insulting Complainant’s modesty

578    The Sofa Incident concerned an offence punishable under s 509 of the Penal Code. For this incident, the accused “shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.” The Prosecution submitted that 1 week’s imprisonment should be imposed.[\[note: 893\]](#Ftn_893) In contrast, DC urged the court to impose a fine of $2,000 or, at most, 1 day’s imprisonment.[^894] I commence analysis by reviewing the cases cited by the parties.

579    In _Liton_, the appellate court noted (at \[87\]) that “for the offence under s 509 in general, a fine of $1,000 to $2,000 is the norm”. In doing so, the court had referred to commentary in _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003). The relevant commentary in the current version of _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) reads as follows at p 606:

> In general, a fine of $1,000 to $2,000 is the norm: _Raveendran v PP_ (MA 125/92/01); _Tan Ping Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 494</span>. **Imprisonment is appropriate where aggravating factors are present**: see _Mohd Raus bin Othman v PP_ where the offence was committed in a lift; _Ramakrishnan s/o Ramayan v PP _(MA 19/98/01) where there were multiple charges and **victims were young**; see _Johari bin Samad v PP_ (MA 69/99/01) where the offender had a previous conviction of a sexual offence. Imprisonment is also appropriate where the offence was carried out with the use of modern technology to record a victim’s private moments without her knowledge. Such an offence differs from other ‘peeping tom’ cases, as the recording on a tape could be replayed, and there is also a risk of circulation of such tapes to other third parties; see _PP v Tay Beng Guan Albert _<span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 778</span>.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

580    In _GCO_, the offender had pleaded guilty to two charges: one charge under s 509 of the Penal Code; and another charge under s 354(1) of the Penal Code. A third charge, under s 447 of the Penal Code, for committing criminal trespass by entering a female toilet to commit the offence underlying the charge under s 509 of the Penal Code, was considered in sentencing. I shall focus only on the offence underlying the charge under s 509 of the Penal Code. The offender was a resident at a Hall of Residence (the “Hall”) at a local university (the “University”). He had been outside one of the female toilets at the Hall at about 5:00am on the relevant day when he heard someone showering inside the toilet. He thus decided to enter the toilet to peep at the person who was showering. At that time, the victim (a 22-year-old student at the University) was showering in the last shower cubicle in the toilet. The offender entered the toilet, went into the shower cubicle next to the victim’s, locked the cubicle door, climbed the cubicle partition, and intruded into the victim’s privacy by peeping into her cubicle. The offender saw the victim fully naked. The victim noticed that someone had peeped into her cubicle, and quickly left the toilet to seek help. The offender stayed in his locked cubicle. The victim and her friends obtained the assistance of a campus security officer, who took a photo of the offender inside the cubicle. The offender then unlocked his cubicle door and surrendered himself to the campus security officer. The District Court sentenced the offender to 1 months’ imprisonment. On appeal, the High Court substituted this sentence with a fine of $2,000. In doing so, the High Court noted that “\[s\]ince the position is that a custodial sentence is not warranted as a starting point even where the aggravating factor of the use of technology is present, it can be said that the threshold for a custodial term ought to be even higher where no such use of technology is present, as \[in _GCO_\]”.[\[note: 895\]](#Ftn_895) The High Court then continued:

> 101     **The key point then is whether the offence was premeditated.** It is certainly true that the \[offender\] should not have entered the female toilet. But that is the subject of the s 447 charge that has been taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. Otherwise, there is **nothing to suggest that the \[offender\] had applied a great deal of foresight or planning prior to committing the offence**. All he had to do was to walk into the toilet, and find the relevant cubicle. **The facts as described in the statement of facts do not suggest that he had given a great deal of thought to planning this entry; instead, the facts appear to suggest that he acted on a whim “when he heard someone showering inside the toilet”.**

> 102    There is some suggestion in the GD that the District Judge thought the \[offender\] came to be outside the toilet because he was harbouring some sinister intent. However, that is not disclosed in the statement of facts. All that is said is that at about 5.00am, the \[offender\] was “outside the female toilet”. And although it is true that the \[offender\] in his own mitigation plea admits to having an urge to “have with him pieces of female clothing while taking showers in the hall’s female toilets as part of his desire to act as a female”, **this general pattern of behaviour does not permit a clear inference that the appellant had gone to the female toilet with the specific intent to insult the modesty of a woman**. It amounts at most to an admission that he habitually trespassed into female toilets. After all, the mitigation plea itself also records that the \[offender\] was “suddenly overcome by an inexplicable urge to peep” at the…victim, which appears to be consistent with the statement of facts. In this instance, I consider that the benefit of the doubt should be given to the \[offender\]. **I therefore find that the \[offender\] did not premeditate the s 509 offence, and the custodial threshold has not been crossed.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

581    In _Tan Pin Seng_, the offender was the victim’s landlord. He was convicted, after a trial, for peeping at the victim (a 22-year-old female) through a hole in the bathroom door while she was taking a shower. The victim was taking a shower in the bathroom when she noticed that her towel, which was thrown over the bathroom door, was being pulled to one side. This exposed a hole in the bathroom door, which had been covered by the towel. The offender was peeping at her through the hole. The victim tried to cover the hole with the towel, but the towel was again pulled to one side. The victim re-covered the hole with the towel, and nothing further happened. The victim saw the shadow of someone moving outside. She finished showering and came out of the bathroom. The offender was in the sitting room, and no one else was in the flat. The victim did not confront the offender over the incident as she was afraid to do so. The District Court sentenced the offender to 1 months’ imprisonment. On appeal, the High Court substituted this sentence with a fine of $2,000. It noted that the custodial sentence was manifestly excessive, although the offender had attempted to cover up his offence (in that he had used “something like plaster, like some kind of tape, sticker tape” to cover the hole in the bathroom door) and had abused his position as a landlord.[\[note: 896\]](#Ftn_896)

582    I noted that the Prosecution accepted that the accused’s conduct during the Sofa Incident was opportunistic (like the offenders in _Tan Pin Seng_ and _GCO_) and not premeditated.[\[note: 897\]](#Ftn_897) I also noted that the offender in _GCO_ had seen the victim fully naked.[^898] In this regard, no evidence was adduced in the instant case as to the duration the accused had looked inside the Complainant’s T-shirt.[^899] I was mindful as well that there was no use of technology during the Sofa Incident.[^900]

583    But, I was nevertheless of the view that the custodial threshold was crossed in this case (and that a sentence of 1 week’s imprisonment was fair) in light of the following factors:

> (a)     The Complainant was a child of only 13 years old, unlike the adult victims in _Tan Pin Seng_ and _GCO_ who were 22 years old.

> (b)     The accused was the Complainant’s stepfather, and there was thus an abuse of a position of trust in a familial context when he looked inside the Complainant’s T-shirt. An abuse of a position of trust in the parent/stepparent and child relationship was necessarily greater than that in the landlord and tenant relationship in _Tan Pin Seng_.

> (c)     The accused had looked inside the Complainant’s T-shirt in the Flat, her home for much of the period between December 2014 and 17 January 2017 – and which should have been a safe sanctuary for her.

> (d)     The accused had brazenly looked inside the Complainant’s T-shirt while the Mother was just metres away in the kitchen.

> (e)     The accused’s actions “shocked” the Complainant.[\[note: 901\]](#Ftn_901)

> (f)     The accused’s actions were not one-off, in that this was his third instance of offending against the Complainant after molesting her during the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident.

> (g)     The accused had not pleaded guilty and was hence not entitled to a sentencing discount.

### Stage 2: Determining how individual sentences should run

584    The second stage of the analysis is to determine how the individual sentences should run. As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively.[\[note: 902\]](#Ftn_902) Here, at least two sentences had to run consecutively, given s 307(1) of the CPC. There is, however, no presumption or rule that the two most severe sentences should ordinarily be selected to run consecutively. Neither is it a rule that the most severe individual sentence of imprisonment must be selected as one of the sentences to run consecutively, so long as the aggregate of the sentences that are so selected exceeds the longest individual sentence (_Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_[^903] (“_Shouffee_”) at \[25\]).

585    On this note, the Prosecution urged the court to run the sentences for the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident (_viz_, the two most severe sentences) consecutively. It submitted that such an order “would be commensurate with the accused’s overall culpability, given that the offences had taken place over two distinct and separate timeframes, and were committed against the same victim”.[\[note: 904\]](#Ftn_904) It also averred that the “accused got increasingly brazen with each transaction of offending”, and elaborated in the following terms:[^905]

> …for the Bedroom Incident, he committed the offence when his son was already asleep and \[the Helper\] was in her room. For the Master Bedroom Incident, his son was in the living room playing while \[the Helper\] was in the kitchen. This shows that the accused was _emboldened_ after his first successful offence (_ie_, the Bedroom Incident), having likely thought that the \[Complainant\] would not resist his advances or cry out for help even though the rest of the family was awake and present in the Flat…

586    In contrast, DC submitted that the sentences for the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident should run concurrently (and the sentences for the Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident should instead run consecutively[\[note: 906\]](#Ftn_906)) as the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident involved the “invasion of the same legally protected interest (_i.e._ the \[Complainant’s\] modesty)”.[^907] DC elaborated in the following terms:[^908]

> 24.    \[W\]e wish to highlight that where sentences are ordered to run consecutively, the one-transaction rule must be borne in mind. The question of whether the various offences form part of a single transaction in turn depends on whether they entail a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest” – as held in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at para 30. In determining this, the proximities in time, place, continuity of action and continuity in purpose or design all have utility – as held in _Shouffee_ at para 28 and 34.

587    I noted that the Sofa Incident also involved the Complainant’s modesty. In any event, DC’s submission in relation to the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident was a misapplication of the one-transaction rule. Where two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, this rule requires that all sentences in respect of those offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive (_Shouffee_ at \[27\]). It is an evaluative rule directed towards whether an offender should be doubly punished for offences that have been committed simultaneously or close together in time (_Shouffee_ at \[32\]). In the final analysis, however, its application is an exercise in common sense (_Shouffee_ at \[40\]).

588    This was not a case where the offences were committed in the course of a single transaction. The victim might have been the Complainant throughout. The classification of the offences underlying the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident (as offences under s 354(2) of the Penal Code) might have been the same as well. But, the charges reflected _different_ offending behaviour on _different_ days and at _different_ locations within the Flat. There was a clear lack of proximity in time and place (_Shouffee_ at \[34\]). This was not a case where the offences involved a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest”. Rather, they involved _multiple_ (and distinct) invasions of the same legally protected interest.[\[note: 909\]](#Ftn_909) It would have been an affront to common sense to suggest that the one-transaction rule applied, in such a case, to preclude the sentences for the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident from being run consecutively. The effect of DC’s submission was that an offender could _repeatedly_ commit the same type of offence against the same victim on _different_ occasions and still expect a sentencing discount – _regardless_ of the number of offences committed. This was tantamount to an inducement to criminal conduct (see also _Janardana Jayasankarr v PP_[^910] at \[17\] and _Chong Yee Ka v PP_[^911] at \[76\]).

589    The question of whether the accused’s offences were related or otherwise “should be addressed with due sensitivity to the facts and a healthy dose of common sense” (_Raveen_ at \[70\]). The offences underlying his charges were plainly separate and unrelated. The general rule that sentences for such offences should run consecutively thus applied (_Raveen_ at \[41\]-\[48). In this case, the application of this general rule would have yielded a total sentence of **37 months’ and 1 week’s imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane**.

### Stage 3: Application of totality principle

590    The third stage of the analysis is to apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality.[\[note: 912\]](#Ftn_912) There are two limbs to the totality principle, characterised by the following questions:

> (a)     Whether the total sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. This calls for a comparison between the total sentence on the one hand and a yardstick on the other hand.

> (b)     Whether the effect of the total sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects.

591    The totality principle is a pivotal qualification to the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences. A mere arithmetic addition of individual sentences might, in many situations and despite the fact that the offences are unrelated, lead to an aggregate sentence that is disproportionate to the overall criminality presented.[\[note: 913\]](#Ftn_913) The totality principle is therefore a principle of limitation and a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions.[^914] That said, I was mindful that the principle is not an excuse for a bulk discount to be given to multiple offending.[^915] Any mitigation of an aggregate sentence by virtue of the totality principle is justified not as a bulk discount on account of multiple offending, but rather as a recognition of the fact that an aggregation resulting in a longer sentence carries a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the cumulative and overall criminality of the case.[^916] In this regard, I was cognisant that the totality principle should ordinarily apply with greater force in cases that involve longer aggregate sentences.[^917]

592    I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentences for the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident should run consecutively. To run the sentences for the Bedroom Incident and the Sofa Incident consecutively (as was DC’s submission) would not adequately reflect the criminality of the accused’s repeated offending. This was also because the severity of the offence underlying the Sofa Incident (and the sentence imposed) paled in comparison to that in relation to the offence underlying the Master Bedroom Incident. I agreed with the Prosecution that to run the sentences for the Bedroom Incident and the Master Bedroom Incident concurrently would give the accused an “unwarranted discount for his criminal conduct”. The “increasingly brazen nature of his actions” in relation to the Master Bedroom Incident would also go unpunished.[\[note: 918\]](#Ftn_918)

593    That said, I was mindful of the first limb of the totality principle – which calls for an examination into whether the total sentence of imprisonment is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed.[\[note: 919\]](#Ftn_919) The assessment, here, is not with regard to the maximum permissible sentence for the most serious of the individual offences committed.[^920] Instead, this limb contemplates comparing the total sentence with the _range_ of sentences normally imposed for the most serious offence (rather than with a specific sentencing benchmark or starting point). This is because the totality principle recommends a broad-brushed “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure the overall proportionality of the total sentence. As such, it is more consonant with the purpose of, and approach recommended by, the totality principle to treat the relevant comparator as the _range_ of sentences normally imposed, rather than as a specific benchmark sentence. In addition, the court should not focus only on the upper limit of the sentencing range. Instead, it should give due regard to the whole sentencing range and the relevant aggravating or mitigating factors present in the particular case to assess whether, on the whole, the sentence is proportionate to the gravity of the offence (_Haliffie_ at \[79\]).

594    In this case, the sentencing range for “Band 2 offences” under s 354(2) of the Penal Code was from 12 to 36 months’ imprisonment. More specifically, the sentencing range for offences at the lower end of Band 2, or the “normal level of sentences” for this class of offences, appears to vary from 15 to 21 months’ imprisonment (in light of _GBR_ at \[33\] and the precedents discussed above[\[note: 921\]](#Ftn_921)). In this regard, the total imprisonment sentence of 37 months’ and 1 week’s imprisonment was about 2½ times of the lower limit of this range and slightly over 1¾ times of the upper limit of this range. It was also more than twice of the mid-point of this range (_viz_, 18 months’ imprisonment).

595    To my mind, this was somewhat excessive. If an aggregate sentence is considered excessive, the sentencing court may opt for a different combination of sentences to run consecutively or adjust the individual sentences” (_Raveen_ at \[98(c)\]. On this note, I opted to do the following:

> (a)     reduce the imprisonment sentence for the Master Bedroom Incident from 18 months’ imprisonment to 13 months’ imprisonment; and

> (b)     run this reduced sentence consecutively with the sentence for the Bedroom Incident.

596    The total sentence therefore amounted to **32 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane**. I noted that the accused was 41 years old. With remission, he would likely be released in less than two years (that is, before he turns 45 years old). In these circumstances, the total sentence was certainly not crushing (or one that would destroy any reasonable expectation of useful life after release). To my mind, the total sentence imposed in this case was a proportionate sentence, which best reflected the accused’s overall criminality.

[^209]: In this regard, I was aware that the general rule of practice is that the evidence of child witnesses is not taken at face value, the reason being that “children at times find it difficult to distinguish between reality and fantasy \[and\] find it difficult after a lapse of time to distinguish between the results of observation and the results of imagination (_Lee Kwang Peng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 569</span> (“_Lee Kwang Peng_”) at \[62\]-\[63\]). That said, this rule is not applied with equal severity to all testimonies by children but is instead calibrated to the circumstances of each case. As noted in _Lee Kwang Peng_ at \[64\], the rationale that children may find it difficult to distinguish between reality and fantasy “applies to different children in different degrees \[and where\] evidence is given by older children whose intellectual faculties are more developed, the danger in convicting without corroboration is diminished”. In a similar vein, it was observed in _GCK_ at \[97\] that “the evidence of children should not be assessed from the perspective of rigid stereotypes, but on a commonsense basis. Each child witness, regardless of his or her age, should have his or her credibility and evidence assessed by reference to criteria appropriate to his or her mental development, understanding, and ability to communicate.”

[^210]: The Stepmother also testified that the Complainant had a timid personality: Day 2, p 33, line 19 to p 34, line 19.

[^411]: The Counsellor.

[^412]: At \[34\] of the “Defence 4th Submissions”, Counsel described the Stepmother’s testimony on her communication with the Counsellor on 16 or 17 January 2017 as a “false development”. That said, this assertion was never put to the Stepmother during her 2021 testimony. I noted that the Counsellor had not alluded to such communication between her and the Stepmother on 16 or 17 January 2017. However, this point was never explored with the Counsellor by either party when the Counsellor testified. Neither did Counsel apply to recall the Counsellor to explore this aspect with the Counsellor.

[^462]: See \[52\]-\[61\] of the “Defence 4th Submissions”. In a similar vein, it was not determinative that the Stepmother had “amended, signed and confirmed” her previous statements at the time of their recording (see \[79\]-\[80\] of the “Defence 4th Submissions).

[^463]: See \[270\] and \[273\] above.

[^464]: See \[241\] above.

[^465]: See \[90\]-\[92\] above. At \[64\] of the “Defence 4th Submissions”, Counsel asserted that “there seems to be real concern in \[the Stepmother’s\] mind to preserve/protect \[the\] status _quo_ of her family and household. If \[the Complainant’s\] bluff is called, care and control may revert to \[the Mother\]. Therefore, more now than ever, \[the Stepmother\] has several reasons, besides those we can deduce, to conceal and misrepresent facts in Court during her \[2021 testimony\]. Simply put, she now has a vested interest to fabricate reasons to depart from her \[previous statements\].” While it was certainly put to the Stepmother that the Stepmother was lying and tailoring her testimony to fit the Complainant’s, the Stepmother’s alleged reasons for doing so (which appear in this extract from the “Defence 4th submissions”) were never raised by Counsel during the Stepmother’s 2021 testimony.

[^588]: Indeed, the accused’s statement that could not remember the number of times he had massaged the Complainant in 2016, coupled with his statement that he had probably massaged her once every “two or three months” in 2016, suggested that the number of massages he had performed on the Complainant were far too many for him to remember: see \[97\] of the PCS.

[^594]: Day 4, p 66, line 29 to 67, line 13. At \[85\]-\[86\] and \[88\]-\[89\] of the DRS, Counsel advanced further assertions to explain why the accused was not able to recall the number of massages he had purportedly performed on the Complainant.

[^611]: See \[378\] above. At \[108\]-\[109\] of the DRS, Counsel attempted to explain away the inconsistency in the accused’s testimony by asserting that the Prosecution had “failed to appreciate that \[the accused was\] drawing a distinction between what he \[could\] do directly as the accused, and what his counsel \[could\] do.” The accused never drew this particular distinction in his testimony. Counsel’s assertion was thus neither relatable to, nor supported by, the evidence adduced from the accused.

[^612]: The accused was also inconsistent as to how he had massaged the Complainant during the incident in the Complainant’s bedroom. In his first statement (Exhibit D8), he claimed that he had “massaged the whole rear part of \[the Complainant’s\] body using \[his\] palms”. He also claimed that his “hands might have brushed through the front part of \[the Complainant’s\] body”. At \[13\] of his second statement (Exhibit D9), however, he claimed that he had used his “elbow and hands” to massage the Complainant. On the other hand, he claimed in his testimony that he had used only his elbow to massage the Complainant (see \[105\] above). Yet, the photographs that he tendered which he claimed depicted how he had massaged the Complainant (Exhibit D4) showed him using his elbows and hands.

[^874]: _GBR_ at \[42\]-\[43\].

[^875]: In this regard, the District Court had “considered the close relationship between the \[offender\] and the victim and her family” and agreed that the offender had “betrayed the trust of the victim who considered the accused to be a father-figure” (_GBR(DC)_ at \[112\]).

[^876]: The victim had testified that “she blamed herself for not standing up to and stopping the \[offender\] from touching her. She said she was too scared to do anything. She was so disgusted with herself after the incident that she resorted to self-injury by cutting her hands” (_GBR(DC)_ at \[31\]). She “committed self-harm \[resulting in visible scarring\] for a period of 2 months before realizing that it did not help her feel any better” (_GBR(DC)_ at \[32\] and \[35\]). “As far as her academic work was concerned, the victim did not feel like going to school anymore and, when she did go, she was not able to concentrate. Her attendance in school and her grades suffered” (_GBR(DC)_ at \[33\]). A child psychiatrist tested that the “victim had shown symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), such as flashbacks, nightmares, and repetitive thoughts regarding the incident and self-harm”. The psychiatrist stated that the “victim’s expression that “she felt dirty” was something that was often heard from victims of sexual abuse who would feel that they were “spoilt goods” (_GBR(DC)_ at \[34\]).

[^877]: In particular, the offender had claimed that the victim:(a)had framed him because she was angry with him for being the cause of her parents’ domestic squabble (_GBR(DC)_ at \[1\]).(b)had framed him because she was angry with him for taking the side of her father in the domestic dispute (_GBR(DC)_ at \[41\]).(c)had “hallucinated the offence or was ‘possessed’ at the time (_GBR(DC)_ at \[41\]).(d)was associating with bad company in school (_GBR(DC)_ at \[42\]).
