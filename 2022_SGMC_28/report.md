TORT – Defamation – fair comment – justification

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/ DCA 14/2022 .\]

24 May 2022

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       This was a one day civil simplified trial whereby the plaintiff sued the defendant for allegedly defamatory posts in 3 Facebook (“FB”) forums relating to the defendant’s unhappiness about the bad service in terms of plaintiff’s charges on subsequent on site attendance and delay in producing the invoice that he experienced when he procured the plaintiff’s services in replacing the defendant’s car battery. It was undisputed that the defendant had made such posts in the 3 forums.

2       At the end of the trial, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim on the basis that the plaintiff had not proven on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was liable for the allegedly defamatory posts. I had found that the posts were not defamatory and even if they were defamatory, the pleaded defences of justification and fair comment applied in the present suit. Being dissatisfied, the plaintiff had since obtained leave from the High Court to appeal against my decision. I shall now provide the grounds of my decision.

## Facts

### The parties

3       The plaintiff is in a business that primarily provides motor vehicle workshop services including vehicle recovery, supply and installation of car parts, vehicle diagnosis, repair and maintenance to road users in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. It was undisputed that on 18 May 2021, the defendant was a customer of the plaintiff who sought the service of the plaintiff to replace the car battery of the defendant’s car.

4       About 10 days after such replacement, the defendant discovered that the audio system and the interior lights of his car did not function as they did prior to the plaintiff’s installation of the new battery. So he contacted the plaintiff via Whatsapp. According to the defendant, the plaintiff offered to assess the defendant’s car issues for an additional fee. But if the car issues were caused by any battery defect, the plaintiff would remedy the car issues at its own cost. However, the defendant rejected the plaintiff’s offer and requested for the plaintiff’s invoice for the battery installation service. It was undisputed that as at date of the trial, no invoice was issued by the plaintiff.

5       On or around 23 June 2021, the defendant engaged Jogh Enterprise which had no less than 18 years’ experience in the automotive repairs industry to assess the car. The car issues were resolved with the assistance of Jogh Enterprise which replaced the battery installed by the plaintiff. Jogh Enterprise also found that the car battery was installed by the plaintiff such that the connections to the battery were loose.

6       It was undisputed that on 19 June 2021, the defendant published a FB post on all 3 FB groups entitled “Bad experience and delay after service request”. The posts contained the following words:

> “ Recently, I had engaged this above car battery replacement service from this provider. I was charged $220 for car battery only on site. Initially \[sic\], everything was ok. 10 days later due to WFH, and realized both my car audio system and roof lights, no power. Called them up and asked for advise whether can come n check the connections as the installation was at night on the actual day. I was told to be charge for the service. I was just wondering, what is the purpose of promise of warranty been told. Asked again for invoice of proof as he (Kel) didn’t issue on Spot. He keep delaying the time of not issue the invoice. Now, no respond at all.”

7       The defendant, via his FB account, was a member of 3 groups on FB. According to \[3\] of the Statement of Claim, 2 of them are private FB group and the last one is a public FB group.

8       For the first group known as “SG Car Accessories Sales Market (“ SGCASMG”), it is a private FB group for car users to share, review and/or advertise items and services related to cars. At the material time, it had approximately 22,000 members. The second group known as “Garage Sales Singapore (“GSSG”) is a private FB group for users to share, review and/or advertise services and items for sale. At the material time, it had approximately 152,700 members. For the last group, it is known as “SG Car Workshops (“SGCWG”) which is a public FB group for Singapore car owners to find car workshops with the best discounts. At the material time, it had approximately 3,500 members.

9       According to the plaintiff, the posts referred or understood to referring to the plaintiff and were defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning. As such posts were made available to the users of the groups, there was publication. As a result, the plaintiff suffered damage to his reputation and hence, the present suit was commenced based on the tort of defamation.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

10     The plaintiff‘s pleaded case was that the posts in their natural and ordinary meaning were understood to mean that the plaintiff had provided a defective car battery to the defendant, the plaintiff had not provided a reasonable and/or proper aftercare service to the defendant, the plaintiff sought to charge the defendant for checking and/or resolving the defective car battery provided by the plaintiff, the plaintiff had breached the warranty pertaining to the car battery, the plaintiff’s service was delayed, the plaintiff caused its customers to have bad experience, the plaintiff engaged in unfair, unscrupulous and/or underhanded business practices, plaintiff’s actions were dishonest and/or deceptive, irresponsible, unprofessional and unethical.

11     According to the plaintiff, these posts were defamatory as they were false in that on 13 June 2021, the plaintiff informed the defendant that the plaintiff was amenable to attend to the defendant’s vehicle and there was a charge if the issues detected and diagnosed did not relate to the car battery. If the issues were related to the car battery, the plaintiff would replace the defective car battery in accordance with the plaintiff’s warranty. But the defendant elected not to proceed. So the plaintiff had provided its services in a reasonable, responsible, professional and ethical manner and did not engage in unfair, deceptive, unscrupulous and/or underhanded business practices.

12     The plaintiff also alleged that there was malicious falsehood in the posts. Therefore, the plaintiff sought reliefs as outlined in \[21\] of the Statement of Claim which was for damages including aggravated damages, order for removal of the posts, written apology in the defendant’s FB account and undertaking by the defendant not to publish any adverse, negative or derogatory statements against the plaintiff.

### The defendant’s version

13     It was undisputed that the defendant made the 3 posts. However, the defendant denied that the words were defamatory. Instead, the words in the context of the FB posts were understood to mean that the plaintiff might have provided a defective car battery to the defendant or accidentally installed it erroneously, the plaintiff offered to only check and/or resolve the defendant’s concerns with the car if an additional fee was paid. Further, the defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff’s services, the defendant was not satisfied that the plaintiff only offered to check and/or resolve the defendant’s concerns for a fee, the defendant had a bad experience with the plaintiff’s services and/or the subsequent correspondence with the plaintiff and the plaintiff was unprofessional insofar as it might have installed a defective car battery and/or installed the car battery erroneously.

14     The defendant also pleaded defence of fair comment and justification. For both defences, they were particularised in \[11\] and \[14\] of the defence. As pleaded in paragraph 11g of the defence, Jogh Enterprise found that the plaintiff’s battery was manufactured in July 2020, the plaintiff had installed the battery such that the connections to the battery were loose and following a replacement of plaintiff’s battery, the car audio system and interior lights had since functioned without issue.

## Issues to be determined

15     The issues before the court were as follows:

> Issue 1- Were the posts relating to charges being payable for subsequent on-site attendance by the plaintiff defamatory?

> Issue 2- Were the posts about the delay on the plaintiff’s part in supplying the defendant with the invoice defamatory?

## Decision of the court

## Issue 1- Were the posts relating to charges being payable for subsequent on-site attendance by the plaintiff defamatory?

### Prima facie defamatory?

16     Reading the posts in their context, I found that the posts were not defamatory in the natural and ordinary meaning. To establish defamation, it is trite that there are 3 elements as laid down in _Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 751</span>:

> a. A statement bearing a defamatory meaning;

> b. Publication to a third party; and

> c. Reference made to the plaintiff.

17     In the present suit, I was of the view that the first element had not been proven by the plaintiff such that the plaintiff had not crossed the first hurdle of showing that there was a prima facie case of defamation. It was undisputed that the second and third elements had been satisfied[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). Hence, I shall focus on the first element.

18     The _Golden Season_ case is most instructive on what constituted a defamatory statement. For a statement to be defamatory, the legal test is that of an ordinary reasonable person who is not avid for scandal and can read between the lines and draw inferences. This test is objective. Where there are a number of possible interpretations, some of which may not be defamatory, such a reader will not seize on only the defamatory one. This reader is treated as having read the publication as a whole and will take note of the circumstances and manner of the publication.

19     I agreed with the defendant that the plaintiff cannot seize merely on the title of the posts entitled “**Bad** service and delay after service request” (emphasis mine) to claim defamation was made out. This was because an ordinary reasonable person would read the rest of the post to better understand the context in which the defendant had narrated his incident.

20     The plaintiff’s particulars as to why the posts were defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning were pleaded in \[9\] of the Statement of Claim. The alternative meaning had been pleaded in \[9\] of the defence. I was of the view that the defendant certainly did not claim in his posts that the plaintiff had definitely provided a defective car battery. Nowhere was such a reference as to defective car battery was made in the posts. The defendant had only posted that the plaintiff had installed a new battery and 10 days later, the defendant experienced car issues. As for the claim that the posts referred to the plaintiff having not provided a proper and/or proper after-care service, there was no such reference in the main text of the post other than the header which I had addressed in \[19\] of this decision. Similarly, the defendant had not made reference or inferred to mean that the plaintiff having engaged in unfair, unscrupulous and underhanded business practice and there was no reference to the plaintiff’s actions and/or conduct having been dishonest, deceptive, irresponsible and unethical. I agreed with the defendant that where unprofessionalism was concerned, it related to the plaintiff’s installation of a defective car battery or accidentally installed the battery erroneously.

21     An ordinary reasonable reader would have read the publication as a whole to determine that the defendant was recounting the incident that happened to him and he was told that there would be a charge. The plaintiff did not deny that there would be a charge if the car issues were not attributable to the car battery installed by the plaintiff. It was not a case of the plaintiff not charging at all for subsequent trouble-shooting of the car issues but the defendant claimed that there were charges. Ultimately, the burden of proof was with the plaintiff to prove that such a statement was defamatory and such burden had not been discharged by the plaintiff.

22     In the present suit, the car battery was newly installed by the plaintiff and the defendant then encountered the car issues so he turned to FB users for assistance and suggestions. Looking at such circumstances, an ordinary reasonable reader would not regard such posts as defamatory but a car owner who was genuinely troubled and wanted to obtain assistance and suggestions from others who might have encountered similar car issues after battery installation.

### Defences of fair comment and justification

23     Given my finding that the posts were not defamatory, there was no need for this court to go into the defences that might apply in the present suit. However, for completeness, I shall address both pleaded defences.

24     Taking the plaintiff’s case at its highest in that the posts were defamatory, I agreed with the defendant that valid defences as pleaded applied. I shall elaborate on my finding on the defence of fair comment.

25     It was pleaded in \[11\] of the defence that the posts were fair comment on a matter of public interest. I agreed with the defendant that it was a fair comment as the defendant was outlining the auto service he had received from the plaintiff which was of public interest to other potential customers, particularly as pleaded in \[1\] of the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff had “an extensive base of road users in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.” Further, the defendant was at the same time attempting to tap on other car owners’ experience and knowledge who could assist with their suggestions to overcome the defendant’s car issues.

26     Here, the statement was one of comment and was based on what the defendant had been communicated to by the plaintiff. As for the legal test of what is fair, it is an objective one when an honest and fair-minded person can honestly hold and express the same on the proven facts. In the present case, given the circumstances, I was of the view that this legal test had been satisfied in that an honest and fair-minded person would write such a review in FB after having experienced the incident.

27     I found that this defence of fair comment had not been defeated by malice. In this regard, I found that the plaintiff had not proven that there was malice on the part of the defendant in making these posts. There was no malice on part of the defendant as in \[12\] of the defendant’s AEIC, the defendant had even defended the plaintiff against comments made by one Benjamin Lai. I found that the defendant did genuinely believe in his posts and hence turned to other car owners in FB for assistance and suggestions.

28     It had been pleaded in \[14\] and \[15\] of the defence that the defence of justification applied. I agreed with the defendant that the posts were substantially true. It is trite that the justification is an absolute defence in a civil defamation claim when the defamatory imputation is true or substantially true. If it is true, then the plaintiff cannot recover damages.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

29     It is trite that the defendant’s burden in proving justification does not extend to proving each and every detail of the offending statement. All he had to establish was the truth of the “sting” complained of.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) According to the plaintiff, it was upset as the defendant’s mention of a charge payable for trouble-shooting car issues without stating that such charge was for non-battery related issues, gave rise to the false, inaccurate representation of the plaintiff that it had unfair trade practices and was dishonest, deceptive, irresponsible, unprofessional and unethical.

30     I found that the defence of justification had been made out when the defendant proved that the defamatory imputation was true. This was where the evidence of Jogh Enterprise was important in determining if the defamatory imputation was true.

31     The plaintiff chose to dispense with the cross examination of Lee Ming Cheng, a mechanic working at Jogh Enterprise which replaced the battery put in by the plaintiff and their diagnosis was that the car issues were caused by loose connection and faulty battery. I found that there was justification in that the battery installed by the plaintiff was defective and/or was installed erroneously. As Jogh Enterprise’s diagnosis was unchallenged, I found that the plaintiff should have attended on site without charge to check the battery they had supplied as the battery was defective and/or poorly installed.

## Issue 2- Were the posts about the delay on the plaintiff’s part in supplying the defendant with the invoice defamatory?

32     I did not find the posts about the delay to be defamatory as an ordinary reasonable reader of the posts would understand that an invoice especially when requested for by a customer should be supplied without undue delay. It was undisputed that the defendant had requested for the invoice on 13 and 16 June 2021 and as the date of the trial, such invoice had not been supplied to the defendant. The plaintiff’s witness agreed during cross examination that it was good practice to issue invoice to customers. In my view, it was clear that invoices are issued as a matter of course for most commercial transactions be it for goods and/or services.

33     Having decided that the post on the delay in the invoice was not defamatory, there was no necessity for this court to address the pleaded defences for this issue. However, I shall for completeness, address the defence of justification.

34     Even if the posts on the delay in issuing the invoice were defamatory, I found that the defence of justification applied. I found that the plaintiff had proven its case in that there was undue delay in the plaintiff supplying the defendant with the invoice for the battery replacement job. In fact, it was undisputed that the invoice still had not been issued as at the date of trial.

## Conclusion

35     For the above reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. I found that there was no counterclaim although the defendant purported to claim $360 as pleaded in \[24\] of the defence. This was because it had not been properly pleaded as a counterclaim. After hearing parties on their submissions relating to costs and disbursements, I fixed the costs and disbursements accordingly to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant.
