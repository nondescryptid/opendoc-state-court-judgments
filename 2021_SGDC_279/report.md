Criminal Law – Statutory Offences – Moneylenders Act

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9278/2021/01.\]

21 December 2021

### District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:

1       The accused aged 34 years was unemployed when he used a red indelible marker to write an O$P$ message on the staircase landing wall near the complainant’s flat at Ang Mo Kio and splashed yellow paint on his gate and door on the instructions of an unlicensed moneylender. The complainant’s domestic maid had borrowed monies from loan sharks. The accused pleaded guilty to one charge of committing an act likely to cause annoyance to the occupant of the flat and which damaged property while acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender, under section 28(2) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) punishable under section 28(2)(a) read with section 28(3)(b)(i).

2       The offence is punishable with a mandatory imprisonment term not exceeding five years jail and a discretionary fine of not less than $5000 and not more than $50,000. In addition as damage had been caused to property, caning of not less than 3 strokes and not more than six strokes was mandatory.

3       I sentenced the accused to 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. The accused is serving sentence and has appealed against my decision.

## The Charge

4       The accused pleaded guilty to the following:

> DAC 909861-2021

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, on the 19th day of May 2021, at or about 4am, at Block 522 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, #XXX, Singapore, while acting on behalf of “Roger”, an unlicensed moneylender, did commit an act likely to cause annoyance to the occupant residing in the said unit, namely, Chee Guo Zhang, in connection with a loan taken by the said occupant’s domestic helper, to wit, by splashing yellow paint onto the gate and main door of the said unit, and using a marker pen with indelible red ink to write “Yayuk Kasmiati O$P$ ROGER +XXX” on the wall at the 3rd floor staircase landing near to the said unit, and in the course of committing the said act, caused damage to the gate and main door of the said unit and wall at the staircase landing, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 28(2) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed), which offence is punishable under s 28(2)(a) read with s 28(3)(b)(i) of the said Act.

## Material Facts

5       The material facts extracted from the Statement of Facts admitted by the accused are set out below.

6       The complainant was Chee Guo Zhang who on 19 May 2021 at about 10.38am called the police and reported that an unlicensed moneylender splashed paint at his unit located at Block 522, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, #XXX, Singapore 560522 (“the Unit”).

7       The complainant was an occupant of the Unit and his domestic helper, Yayuk Kasmiati, had taken loans from unlicensed moneylenders.

8       Investigations revealed that on 17 May 2021, the accused joined a group chat called “Darksgmarket” on the Telegram App on his handphone. He saw a post stating “looking for fast cash only do easy job pm me”. The accused responded to the said post and contacted the person who made that post.

9       Shortly after, he received a whatsapp message from a Malaysian number offering him payment of SGD$450 to harass debtor’s units on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender known as “Roger” (“the UML”) by splashing paint at the gate and door of the targeted units and using a red marker pen to write on the wall near to the units.

10     The accused was sent an address on the 9th floor of Block 104 Jalan Bukit Merah in Singapore to harass. Although the accused did not respond to accept the offer, he visited the said address. However, he did not harass the said unit as he saw that the unit’s door was open and there were people inside. He left the place and returned home.

11     On 18 May 2021, the accused informed the UML via whatsapp that he did not harass the said unit for the said reasons. He was given the address of the Unit to harass in the same manner for payment of SGD$450. Despite knowing that the UML was an unlicensed moneylender as he was not an excluded moneylender or an exempted moneylender or authorised to do so by licence and that the accused would be assisting in the UML’s unlicensed moneylending business, the accused nevertheless agreed to harass the Unit.

12     Acting on the instructions of the UML, the accused drove a car to the carpark of the Unit on 19 May 2021. He brought a bottle containing yellow paint and a marker pen with indelible red ink and walked up the stairs to the third floor staircase landing near to the Unit at about 4am.

13     The accused used the said marker pen to write “Yayuk Kasmiati O$P$ ROGER +XXX” on the wall at the said staircase landing. He used his handphone to video record his writing on the wall. He then walked to the Unit, splashed yellow paint onto the gate and main door of the Unit. He also used his handphone to video record this process. After doing so, he ran down the stairs to the first floor, boarded his car and returned home.

14     The accused had defaced the property. The damage that he caused to the gate and main door of the Unit and the wall at the said staircase landing was as shown in the two photographs contained in the statement of facts.

15     The accused sent the said video recordings to the UML but did not receive any money.

16     The CCTV at the ground floor of the Unit captured the accused walking up and down the stairs before and after committing the said offence. The accused was subsequently traced by the police and placed under arrest on 27 May 2021. The clothes and shoes that he wore at the time of the offence and the said marker pen were seized by the police.

17     The accused had committed an act likely to cause annoyance to the complainant in connection with a loan taken by his domestic helper, and in so doing, had caused damage to the gate and main door of the Unit and the wall at the staircase landing. The accused has therefore committed an offence under s 28(2) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed), which offence is punishable under s 28(2)(a) read with s 28(3)(b)(i) of the said Act. The accused admitted to the offence and was charged accordingly.

## Antecedents

18     The accused had previous convictions in 2005, 2010 and 2011.

19     In April 2005 he was sentenced to reformative training for rioting.

20     In June 2010, he was convicted for two charges under section 14(1)(b)(i) of the Moneyenders’ Act for assisting in the contravention of section 5(1) of the said Act, and one charge of absence without leave. He was sentenced to two months’ jail for each offence, with two of the sentences running consecutively making a total of four months’ jail.

21     In March 2011, he was convicted of two traffic-related charges. He was sentenced to four weeks’ jail, fined and disqualified from driving for three years, for offences of driving whilst under disqualification and using a vehicle without insurance.

## Prosecution submitted for at least 12 months’ jail and three strokes of the cane

22     Prosecution’s skeletal was brief, stating only that they were seeking at least 12 months’ jail and 3 strokes of the cane, and the case of _PP v Nelson Jeyaraj s\\o Chandran_ \[2011\] 2SLR 1130 (“_Nelson Jeyaraj_”) was attached.

23     In court, prosecution urged the court to have regard to the nature of the damage, comprising defacement to the wall and splashing of paint on the door and gate. Although the accused had money-lending related antecedents in 2010, prosecution stated they were not seeking an uplift of the benchmark sentence as the accused’s antecedents were dated.

## Mitigation

24     The accused was unrepresented. In mitigation, he said he was married with three stepchildren. He had a stable job as a driver making $3000 to $4000 a month but was retrenched because of Covid. He did many kinds of part-time jobs, earning daily or weekly just to provide for his family needs. He became stressed and could not pay his bills and the loans for his new flat, and was also rejected for support grants.

25     He came across the messaging app and knew it was not a good idea but his mind was not stable and he made the wrong decision. He was not paid for what he did and the offence aside, he did not have anything to do with loan sharks.

26     He was remorseful and had tried not to commit any offences since his last conviction. His previous convictions were from many years ago and he had upgraded himself. He initially drove a school bus and then became a limousine driver and also worked as a personal driver. He had co-operated with investigations and the courts and pleaded for leniency.

## Sentencing considerations

### Benchmark sentence for non-fire harassment with property damage

27     The High Court in _Nelson Jeyaraj_ observed that sentences of 12 months and the mandatory minimum of three strokes of the cane had been imposed for non-fire harassment resulting in property damage, and stated there was no reason why the benchmark for non-fire harassment with property damage should be revised: at \[47\].

28     The court further guided that the mandatory caning should not affect the custodial term to be imposed. It dismissed the argument that the custodial term should be calibrated to reflect the mandatory minimum of three strokes of the cane as this would undermine Parliament’s intent to take a harsher stance against unlicensed moneylending: at \[64\] to \[67\].

### Valid mitigating factors

29     I accepted as valid mitigating factors that the accused had pleaded guilty and co-operated with investigations. I also took his early plea of guilt as evidence of his remorse. These were given due weight.

30     However that he committed the offence because of his financial difficulties was not mitigating. In _Nelson Jeyaraj_ itself, the court citing _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP_ \[1993\] 2 SLR( R) 406 had rejected as mitigating the accused’s plea that he committed the offences out of financial desperation, and re-iterated that financial difficulties cannot be relied on save in the most exceptional or extreme circumstances: at \[53\]. The issue of the accused’s financial difficulties will be further discussed at \[42\] to \[44\] below.

31     As for not receiving the promised payment after he had committed the offences and sent the videos to the UML, this could not be mitigating. Being played out by the UML did not relate to anything the accused had done for which he could claim mitigating credit. Likewise his claim that he did not otherwise have any dealings with the UML apart from the offence he committed was a neutral factor. To the contrary, if he did otherwise have other dealings with the UML, they could under certain circumstances constitute aggravating factors or separate offences.

### Offence-specific factors

32     Against the valid mitigating factors, there were several offence-specific factors to be considered.

33     As prosecution had submitted and the court in _Nelson Jeyaraj_ had observed, the nature and extent of the property damage was relevant to sentencing. In this case the accused had not only splashed paint at the gate and door of the unit where the debtor resided, he had also defaced the wall at the staircase landing with an indelible marker pen. As far as non-fire harassment cases go, his offence was not at the minimal end of the harm spectrum, nor did the accused take any steps to reduce the harm caused.

34     The level of premeditation and deliberation involved were also relevant. The facts disclosed that the accused had time to contemplate and deliberate his actions, and he had been lured to assist the UML by the promise of easy money. His decision to assist the UML was not made at the spur of the moment. The present offence related to a second unit the accused had been asked to harass. The accused first saw the post about the “easy job” on 17 May 21 and the next day on the 18th of May 21 he went to physically observe a unit at Jalan Bukit Merah that the UML had asked him to harass. After that he got in touch with the UML again and was then passed the address of the Unit to harass.

## Parameters of benchmark sentence

35     The High Court in _Ong Chee Eng v PP_ \[201\] 3 SLR 776 (“_Ong Chee Eng_”) had guided on the application of benchmark sentences in the context of moneylending offences. It noted that although there was no doubt that Parliament’s intention in prescribing mandatory sentences was to deter loan shark activities and the court must therefore uphold these deterrence objectives, the principle of tailoring the punishment to the crime and the criminal also extends to the use of the benchmark sentences. The court should resist an unhesitating application of benchmark sentences without first considering whether the particular factual circumstances fell within the reasonable parameters of the benchmark case: at \[10\], \[22\] and \[24\].

36     In noting with approval the benchmark sentence of 12 months’ jail and 3 strokes of the cane for non-fire harassment, the court in _Nelson Jeyaraj_ had referred to the cases of _PP v Wu Wei Chun_ (DAC 31830\\2010) (“_Wu Wei Chun_”) and _PP v Kau Wei Keong_ (DAC 19918\\2010) (“_Kau Wei Keong_”). Although the court did not elaborate that the benchmark sentence for non-fire harassment cases was in respect of plead-guilty cases, both _Wu Wei Chun_ and _Kau Wei Keong_ dealt with offenders who had pleaded guilty to harassment offences involving the splashing of paint and marking with indelible markers. Having noted the benchmark for non-fire cases, the court in _Nelson Jeyaraj_ went on to set a higher benchmark sentence of 18 months’ jail and three strokes of the cane for harassment using fire and imposed it on the offender who had pleaded guilty.

37     The present case was absent the confluence of mitigating features present in _Ong Chee Eng_ where the court had expressed that a discount could have been given to reflect the steps taken by the offender to minimise the damage caused to the property. The _Ong Chee Eng_ offender had diluted the paint with turpentine so it could be wiped away, splattered only half a cup’s worth of paint and used non-permanent marker pens.

38     The court in _Ong Chee Eng_ had further noted the circumstances under which the offender became involved in the offences. He had been a law-abiding citizen who became involved with loan sharks when he guaranteed a friend’s loan shark loan, had the misfortune of being retrenched, then began borrowing from other loan sharks himself. He had also gone to the extent of selling his HDB flat to pay his debts and confessed to the bulk of the charges brought against him which the police would otherwise have been unable to pin on him: at \[7\],\[8\], \[39\],\[40\] and \[41\].

39     In _PP v Quek Li Hao_ \[2013\] 4 SLR 477 (“_Quek Li Hao_”) the High Court clarified that the sentencing discount mentioned by the court in _Ong Chee Eng_ should be applied to offenders who had taken efforts to minimise property damage in non-fire harassment cases, even if the offender may have been driven by some genuine financial need.

40      _Quek Li Hao_ observed that _Ong Chee Eng_ had grouped offenders into those who turned to loan-sharking activities because of genuine financial needs arising from sudden sickness or prolonged retrenchment (“genuine financial needs” category) and those less deserving of sympathy such as youths and gamblers who harassed because of the lure of easy money (“greed and self-interest” category): at \[24\] and \[25\]. It noted that although the offender in _Ong Chee Eng_ fell into the genuine financial needs category, the court had in fact left undisturbed his benchmark sentence of 12 months’ jail and 3 strokes of the cane despite opining that a small discount of one to two months could have been given as the offender had taken steps to minimise damage: at \[26\].

41      _Quek Li Hao_ guided that this small discount could be given in non-fire harassment cases when the accused took steps to minimise damage, like the offender in _Ong Chee Eng_ had done. However there was no reason why the benchmark sentence of 12 months and three strokes of the cane should not be imposed on the _Quek Li Hao_ offender even though he fell within the “genuine financial needs” category, as the offender had needed monies for his parents’ hospitalisation and was a guarantor-turned debtor-turned harasser: at \[27\]. The court futher observed the _Quek Li Hao_ offender was actually in a better financial position than the unemployed offender in _Ong Chee Eng_ as he was employed with a monthly salary of $2500: at \[28\]. Further the _Quek Li Hao_ offender had not taken any steps to minimise the damage caused to the flats and surroundings. Instead he had splashed paint to a neighbour’s flat which was aggravating: at \[37\] and \[38\].

42     In the present case, the accused’s circumstances were different from that of the _Ong Chee Eng_ and _Quek Li Hao_ offenders. He was not a guarantor-turned debtor-turned harasser. As regards his financial difficulties, he had in fact been engaged in part-time employment after losing his job. Even if his claims about prolonged lack of full-time unemployment since Covid started and his personal and housing debts were true and he was considered as being in the genuine financial needs category, there was no reason why the benchmark sentence should not apply to him as he had not taken any steps to minimise the property damage.

43     The totality of the mitigating factors in the present case did not provide any basis to warrant a discount from the sentencing benchmark, and more so when viewed against the offence-specific factors that were present. I agreed with prosecution that as the accused’s prior moneylending- related precedents were dated they would not warrant an uplift of the benchmark sentence, and he had also stayed crime-free for a substantial period. However the accused was not a first offender like the accused in _Ong Chee Eng_ who had been a law-abiding citizen until he became entangled with loan sharks. The primary sentencing consideration was deterrence, both general as well as specific deterrence, and his prior moneylending- related antecedents were relevant.

44     When the accused’s acts, culpability and circumstances were viewed in totality, the accused stood in a very different position from the _Ong Chee Eng_ offender who the court said merited a sentencing discount from the benchmark sentence. I was satisfied that the present case fell within the reasonable parameters of the benchmark case.

## Conclusion

45     All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and 3 stokes of the cane would be an appropriate and sufficient punishment, and I sentenced the accused accordingly. As the accused was arrested on 27 May 21 and bailed out on 2 June 21, I backdated his sentence to the date of arrest and for his remand period to be taken into account and to exclude the period he was on bail.
