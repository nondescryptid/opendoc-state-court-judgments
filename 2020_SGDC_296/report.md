### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a 42-year-old male Singaporean, claimed trial to a charge under section 8(_b_)(ii) punishable under section 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) for consumption of methamphetamine, without authorisation (DAC-938348-2018). The Accused was also liable to be punished with enhanced sentence of imprisonment, under section 50T of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Prisons Act”), for a term not exceeding 535 days’ imprisonment as the Accused was deemed to have breached a basic condition of his remission order.

2       The Accused was unrepresented.

3       On 10 December 2020, I convicted the Accused on the consumption charge. Upon conviction, the Accused pleaded guilty to a charge (MAC-908621-2018) punishable under section 50Y(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act, with a term not exceeding 505 days’ imprisonment, for committing a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of his Remission Order.

4       After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation plea, I sentenced the Accused to a total term of imprisonment of seven years and 465 days, and 6 strokes of the cane, on 16 December 2020. The term of imprisonment was to take effect from 6 September 2018, which was the Accused’s date of remand. Out of the 465 days’ imprisonment, 430 days constituted the enhanced sentence under section 50T of the Prisons Act. The remaining 35 days were for the offence under section 50Y(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act.

5       The Accused has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence in DAC-938348-2018, and he is currently serving sentence. I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The Prosecution’s Case

6       To prove its case, the Prosecution adduced evidence from 16 witnesses, comprising mainly enforcement officers. The remaining witnesses were three officers from the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”), and two doctors. The doctors were general practitioners and the Accused had visited their clinics between May and September 2018.

7       I will deal with the Prosecution’s case in three parts:

> (i)     the accused’s arrest;

> (ii)     events after the arrest; and

> (iii)     the analysis of the accused’s urine sample and exhibits by the Health Sciences Authority.

### The arrest

8       Sgt Lim Guo Quan (PW1) (“Sgt Lim”), SC/Sgt Saghir Khan (PW2) (“SC/Sgt Saghir”) and SC Jerel Ong Bao Xiang (PW3) (“SC Ong”) gave evidence that they spotted the Accused walking unsteadily at about 7.00pm while they were performing patrol duty at Aljunied MRT Station on 4 August 2018. At that time, the three officers were serving their national service at the Public Transport Security Command (“TransCom”). They approached the Accused and did a cursory search of his belongings. As nothing incriminating was found, they allowed the Accused to go[^1].

9       About 10 minutes later, the trio spotted the Accused again at the concourse area outside the MRT gantries. This time around, Sgt Lim noticed that the Accused had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech[^2]. However, Sgt Lim found that the Accused did not smell of alcohol[^3]. They then brought the Accused to the first-aid room of Aljunied MRT Station for a more thorough check and found a packet of “Kapsul Asam Urat”, a slab of “Remethan”, and a slab of “Celecoxib” in his bag[^4]. In addition, the Accused told Sgt Lim and SC/Sgt Saghir that he had consumed cough syrup and some other medications such as “epam” and “codeine”[^5]. The Accused was placed under arrest and the Police Ops Room was informed[^6].

### The events after the arrest

10     The Accused was then handed over to Sgt Muhammad Nasrul Amiruddin bin Sulaiman (PW4) (“Sgt Nasrul”) and Sgt Goh Sheng Yang Shaun (PW5) (“Sgt Goh”), together with the exhibits which were seized. Sgt Nasrul and Sgt Goh escorted the Accused to Bedok Police Division Headquarters and an arrest report was lodged (P2) at about 9.35pm[^7]. The exhibits which were seized from the Accused were also reflected in the arrest report[^8]. Sgt Nasrul further explained that he lodged a case summary form[^9] to make a correction to the earlier arrest report as he had erroneously reflected that the Accused was arrested for an offence under section 8(_a_) of the MDA, when the Accused was in fact placed under arrest for an offence under section 8(_b_) of the MDA for suspected drug consumption[^10].

11     On the same day, the Accused was escorted by Sgt Loh Wai Lon (PW6) (“Sgt Loh”) for his urine sample to be taken. The Accused was directed by Sgt Loh to wash his hands and choose a red-capped bottle from a box containing not less than 10 bottles and two blue-capped bottles (which were sealed and pre-packed) from a box containing not less than 20 bottles. Thereafter, the Accused provided his urine sample by urinating into the red-capped bottle. On the instruction of Sgt Loh, the Accused poured his urine sample into the blue-capped bottles. After this was done, Sgt Loh handed over the Accused to SSI Mohammed Rizal bin Samad (PW7) (“SSI Rizal;”) for an Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) to be conducted[^11].

12     SSI Rizal testified that he took over the custody of the Accused from Sgt Loh. At that time, the Accused was holding onto two polymer bags – one of the bags contained a red-capped bottle while the other bag contained two blue-capped bottles[^12]. SSI Rizal then performed the IUT from the urine sample taken from the red-capped bottle[^13]. The Accused tested positive for amphetamines and benzodiazepines as reflected in the Urine Test Result Slip (P6)[^14].

13     Thereafter, the Accused was shown two printed Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) labels by SSI Rizal and was told to verify his name and particulars[^15]. The Accused signed on the labels after confirming his name and particulars. SSI Rizal then sealed the blue-capped bottles in the presence of the Accused, following which, the Accused deposited them into a locked metal box[^16]. The Accused was then brought back to the lock-up, and SSI Rizal brought the metal box and stored it in the refrigerator within the CNB[^17].

14     The Accused’s urine sample, which was in the locked metal container, was submitted to the HSA for analysis on 6 August 2018 by Sgt Mohammad Hambali bin Amir (PW7) (“Sgt Hambali”). Sgt Hambali testified that the key for the metal container was with the HSA[^18] and as far as he was aware, there had been no leakage or urine bottles being broken[^19].

### The HSA analysis

15     The Accused’s urine sample was analysed by officers from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, and supervised by Maggie Tiong Su Su (PW10) (“Mdm Tiong”) and Ng Chee Ann (PW11) (“Mr Ng”). It was the evidence of Mdm Tiong and Mr Ng that the Accused urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine[^20].

16     The “Kapsul Asam Urat” which was found in the Accused’s possession at the time of arrest, and a black pill which was given to SI Samir bin Haroon (PW13) (“SI Samir”) by the Accused’s mother were also analysed by the HSA. It is the evidence of Chin Shi Lih Reenie (PW12) (“Ms Chin”), an analyst from the Illicit Drug Laboratory of the HSA, that the capsule and the pill did not contain any “common controlled drug”. In addition, Ms Chin testified that the “Kapsul Asam Urat” was handed over to the HSA in a sealed tamper-proof bag. Ms Chin confirmed that when the “Kapsul Asam Urat” package was opened, there was only a single capsule within[^21].

## The Defence’s Case

17     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Accused made a submission of no case to answer. After hearing parties, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case against the Accused and called upon the Accused to give evidence in his defence.

18     The Accused elected to give evidence. He also called a defence witness, Dr Abinaya, for the main trial. Dr Abinaya was one of the doctors who saw the Accused between May and September 2018.

### The evidence of the Accused

19     At the start of the trial, the Accused said that his defence was that he had consumed the decongestant Robitussin PS prior to his arrest[^22]. As the trial progressed, he claimed to have consumed a whole host of other medications[^23]. In addition, he claimed that his urine sample was contaminated as Sgt Loh did not follow the procedure set out in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap 185, RG 6) (“MDR”), in that Sgt Loh had told him to wash the red-capped bottle, and he did so accordingly[^24]. Further, Accused claimed that he was not in the right state of mind to verify his name and particulars on the printed labels presented by SSI Rizal[^25].

20     Soon after SI Samir took the stand, the Accused decided to add on the allegation that the enforcement officers had mishandled a bottle of cough syrup and a black pill which were allegedly in his possession at the time of arrest[^26].

21     As part of his case, the Accused also adduced literature relating to the manufacture of methamphetamine (D1), a short write-up on pseudoephedrine and ephedrine (D2), a printout on the ingredients found in Robitussin PS (D3), his long statement (D4), printouts giving a description of Desoxyn (D5) and Didrex (D6), literature on the metabolization of methamphetamine (D7) and the medical report of one Rangseb s/o Saidek (D8).

22     In the Accused’s long statement (D4), he stated that he did not abuse any controlled drugs. However, he claimed that his urine had tested positive as he had taken a tablet which he bought in Geylang, and that the supplement was easily available on the street. He further informed that the name of the supplement was “Kapsul Asam Ubat”[^27], the same supplement which was seized by the TransCom officers at the time of his arrest[^28].

### The evidence of Dr Abinaya

23     The Accused called Dr Abinaya (DW2) as a defence witness. Dr Abinaya testified that she was not sure if the consumption of a whole bottle of diphenhydramine would cause a “positive in methamphetamine”. However, it “\[could\] cause drowsiness”[^29]. She was not familiar with Robitussin and was unsure if pseudoephedrine would cause a false positive for methamphetamine[^30].

## The Ancillary Hearing

24     In the course of cross-examining the Accused, the Prosecution sought to admit a further statement of the Accused which was recorded on 18 September 2018 (P21), and the Accused’s cautioned statement (P22). In relation to P21, the Accused alleged that he had declined to sign the statement, and that the recording officer, Sgt Loh Wai Lon (PW1)[^31], had threatened him and told him that he (Sgt Loh) would “make sure \[he\] go in for LT2 (sic)”[^32].

25     As for his cautioned statement, the Accused alleged that he had informed the recording officer, ASP Goh Pei Ying (PW2)[^33], “about the cough syrup, sleeping pill, and the vape” but ASP Goh failed to record that. In addition, he had declined to sign the cautioned statement.

26     The Accused’s allegations were flatly denied by Sgt Loh and ASP Goh. At the end of the ancillary hearing, I was satisfied that both the further statement and the cautioned statement were voluntarily given by the Accused and admitted them accordingly.

27     In his further statement, the Accused denied consuming any controlled drugs and claimed that he had only taken the medication from Access Medical Pte Ltd, and the supplement which was seized on the day of his arrest.

28     The Accused’s cautioned statement was a bare denial – he denied consuming any controlled drugs.

## Prosecution’s Application to Recall Witnesses

29     Pursuant to the belated allegation by the Accused that the enforcement officers had mishandled a bottle of cough syrup and a black pill, the Prosecution made an application under section 283(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) to recall the five enforcement officers to clarify their evidence in relation to the bottle of cough syrup and the black pill. In addition, the Prosecution sought to recall Mdm Tiong to clarify some of the defence exhibits adduced by the Accused when he was on the stand.

30     Having considered the application by the Prosecution and the fact that the Accused was in person and was not familiar with court proceedings, I allowed the application so that the Accused would not be prejudiced and to ensure that all evidence essential for the making of a just decision was before me.

31     On further examination, the TransCom officers (Sgt Lim[^34], SC/Sgt Saghir[^35] and SC Ong[^36]) and the arresting officers (Sgt Nasrul[^37] and Sgt Goh[^38]) clarified that there were only three exhibits which were seized from the Accused on the day of the arrest, and these were documented in P2[^39].

32     In relation to the defence exhibits which were tendered by the Accused when he was on the stand, Mdm Tiong confirmed that the active ingredient in Desoxyn was methamphetamine hydrochloride, and the main ingredient for Didrex was benzophetamine hydrochloride, with hydrochloride being the stabiliser which would convert methamphetamine and benzophetamine in these two compounds into solid form[^40]. Both Desoxyn and Didrex were not available in Singapore[^41].

33     Mdm Tiong further clarified that while the consumption of ephedrine or methamphetamine could give rise to the presence of norephedrine in a urine sample, the consumption of ephedrine would not give rise to methamphetamine[^42]. As for the reference of “methamphetamine” in the plural form, as referred to in D8, Mdm Tiong explained that it is the practice of HSA to use “methamphetamine” in its plural form when referring to a group of drugs which contained similar structures as methamphetamine[^43]. However, when used in the singular form, “methamphetamine” referred specifically to the drug methamphetamine[^44].

## Closing Submissions

### The Prosecution’s submissions

34     The Prosecution submitted, _inter alia_, that based on the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, the procedures set out in the MDR were complied with and the Accused was therefore presumed to have consumed methamphetamine[^45].

35     The Prosecution further submitted that the Accused was not a credible witness – his allegations were afterthoughts and tailored to exculpate himself. In addition, the defences raised by him were based on conjecture[^46].

### The Accused’s submissions

36     The Accused submitted, _inter alia_, that the TransCom officers and arresting officers had mishandled a bottle of cough syrup and a black pill which were in his possession at the time of arrest. The Accused alleged that Sgt Nasrul had caused the bottle of cough syrup and black pill to be lost as he failed to reflect them in the arrest report (P2)[^47]. He further claimed that there should be two “Kapsul Asam Ubat”[^48] capsules in the package and that it was “illogical” that Ms Chin (PW12) only found one capsule when the package was opened by the HSA analyst[^49].

37     The Accused also submitted that there were “procedural errors” in the procurement of his urine sample as he had “followed PW6’s[^50] instructions to wash the red-capped bottle”[^51]. In addition, as he had consumed a huge amount of “benzodiazepines” before his arrest, he was not in the right state of mind to check his name and other details on the printed CNB labels shown to him by SSI Rizal (PW7) before signing on the labels[^52].

38     The Accused also accused the Prosecution of breaching its “additional disclosure obligation” by failing to provide the statements of the TransCom officers and the arresting officers to him[^53].

## My Decision

### The applicable provisions

39     The Accused was charged under section 8(_b_)(ii) of the MDA, for consumption of methamphetamine, without authorisation. His urine specimen was tested positive for methamphetamine. Section 22 of the MDA states:

> **Presumption relating to urine test**

> **22**.    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(_b_), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(_b_).

40     Section 31(4) of the MDA specifies the manner in which a specimen of urine was to be dealt with:

> (4)    A specimen of urine provided under this section shall be divided into 3 parts and dealt with, in such manner and in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed, as follows:

>> (_a_)    a preliminary urine test shall be conducted on one part of the urine specimen; and

>> (_b_)    each of the remaining 2 parts of the urine specimen shall be marked and sealed and a urine test shall be conducted on each part by a different person, being either an analyst employed by the Health Sciences Authority or any person as the Minister may, by notification in the _Gazette_, appoint for such purpose.

> …

> (7)    The certificate stating the result of a urine test may be signed by an analyst or person appointed under subsection (6) notwithstanding that he did not personally conduct the test to analyse the urine specimen as long as the test was conducted by another person acting under his direction.

### The procurement of urine

41     The present case did not involve any complicated issues of law. It premised mainly on the credibility of the Prosecution witnesses, and the credibility of the Accused. The Prosecution also relied on section 22 of the MDA, which presumed that the Accused had consumed the methamphetamine which was detected in his urine sample by the HSA analysts.

42     Based on the evidence of the enforcement officers and the HSA analysts, I was satisfied section 22 of the MDA had been triggered, and the presumption applied – I found that the Accused’s urine sample was procured and analysed in accordance with section 31(4) and (7) of the MDA as set out above, and the First Schedule to the MDR. Consequently, the Prosecution had established the ingredients of the consumption charge against the Accused.

43     The Accused raised the argument that the First Schedule to the MDR was breached. He alleged belatedly that he was not in the state to verify his name and particulars on the printed labels before they were signed, and that he had followed the instructions of Sgt Loh to wash the red-capped bottle. These propositions were not put to SSI Rizal and Sgt Loh respectively when they were on the stand. While the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 would apply to the Accused in the present case, I accorded some latitude to the Accused as he was in person and did not hold him strictly to the rule in _Browne v Dunn_[^54]:

> It seems to me to be _absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made_, and not to take his evidence and passed it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit…

> \[emphasis added\]

However, the fact that the Accused had the tendency to shift his position and add on to his defence more allegations against the officers as the trial progressed could not be ignored.

44     I therefore rejected the Accused’s argument that he was not in a right state to verify his name and particulars on the printed labels before signing. I noted too, that while he claimed to be under the effects of the medication that was allegedly taken by him prior to his arrest, he was able to remember, with surprising clarity that he had washed the red-capped bottle.

45     Even if the Accused had washed the red-capped bottle, which I disbelieved, this extra step would not have contravened the First Schedule to the MDR:

**PROCUREMENT OF URINE SPECIMEN**

> 1.    A suspect who is required to provide a specimen of his urine shall be directed by an enforcement officer to wash and dry his hands.

> 2.    The suspect shall be asked by an enforcement officer to choose, in the presence of the enforcement officer, a master bottle that is pre-packed and sealed from a lot of not less than 10 bottles provided by the enforcement officer and 2 containers that are pre-packed and sealed from a lot of not less than 20 containers provided by the enforcement officer.

> 3.—(1)    The suspect shall then carry with him the master bottle and the 2 containers of his choice and be escorted by the enforcement officer (or some other officer authorised by the enforcement officer) to an appropriate place to provide his urine specimen.

> …

> 4.—(1)    The suspect shall urinate into the master bottle.

> (2)    The officer escorting the suspect shall ensure that the urine specimen in the master bottle is that of the suspect and not that of any other person.

> …

> **Sealing of containers for analysis by Health Sciences Authority**

> 13.    An enforcement officer must observe the following procedures when sealing the 2 containers for the purpose of analysis by the Health Sciences Authority:

>> …

>> (c)    the suspect shall be allowed to check and sign the labels in the presence of the officer. If the suspect is unable to read, the officer shall read the particulars on the labels to the suspect. The officer shall then affix the labels to seal the containers;

>> (d)    the officer shall ask the suspect himself to deposit one container of the urine specimen into each of the 2 security boxes which shall be kept locked at all times until the boxes are delivered to the Health Sciences Authority.

46     While the First Schedule sets out the specific steps to observe, there is no specific prohibition against washing the red-capped bottle with tap water. Even if there was non-compliance with the First Schedule, which submission I rejected, there was sufficient evidence from the Prosecution to infer that the Accused had consumed methamphetamine:

> (i)     at the time of arrest, the Accused was observed to be unsteady, with bloodshot eyes and slurred speech;

> (ii)     he did not smell of alcohol;

> (iii)     there was no possibility of the urine sample provided by the Accused and collected by Sgt Loh being contaminated or compromised; and

> (iv)     his urine sample was analysed and found to contain methamphetamine.

47     I next considered if the Accused had rebutted the presumption, under section 22 of the MDA, on a balance of probabilities. I will first deal with the alleged contamination of the urine sample and the HSA analysis process.

### Alleged contamination and the analysis process

48     I rejected the Accused’s argument that his urine sample was contaminated by the washing of the bottle with tap water, based on Mdm Tiong’s evidence that the washing of the bottle with tap water would not affect the result of the urine test[^55]. I also rejected his claim that his urine sample could have been contaminated in the HSA laboratory as the Accused claimed that many other drugs were analysed in the same laboratory. This was categorically denied by both Mdm Tiong[^56] and Mr Ng[^57]. Indeed, the Accused was unable to substantiate his allegation and I found his allegation to be without basis. It was noteworthy that the methamphetamine level in the Accused’s urine sample was very high – at 17,800ng/ml of urine as found by Mdm Tiong[^58] and 19,200ng/ml of urine as found by Mr Ng[^59]. The concentration of methamphetamine in the Accused’s urine sample was therefore more than 35 times above the cut-off reading of 500ng/ml of urine.

49     In addition to the suggestion that his urine sample could have been contaminated by the drugs in the HSA laboratory, the Accused took issue with the fact that both Mdm Tiong and Mr Ng did not “personally” conduct the analysis of his urine sample[^60]. This argument was misconceived as there was no requirement for Mdm Tiong and Mr Ng to personally analyse the Accused’s urine sample. Under section 31(7) of the MDA[^61], the HSA certificates stating the result of the Accused’s urine test may be signed by them notwithstanding that they did not personally conduct the test to analyse the urine specimen as long as the test was conducted by another person acting under their direction[^62], and I found that the analysis of the Accused’s urine sample was properly conducted under the supervision of Mdm Tiong and Mr Ng.

50     The Accused also suggested that the urine sample which SSI Rizal had used for the IUT could have been contaminated[^63]. I rejected this argument as well. Again, the Accused had not supported his allegation with any evidence. Even if the environment under which the IUT was performed had affected the IUT result, which argument I rejected, that had no bearing on the findings by Mdm Tiong and Mr Ng, as their analysis was conducted in a controlled environment within the HSA laboratory.

51     I next considered the Accused’s claim that he had consumed various medications prior to his arrest.

### Consumption of various medications

52     On the outset, I found it unbelievable that the Accused had consumed, prior to his arrest, all the medications listed by him during the trial. The Accused claimed that he drank bottles of cough syrup just prior to his arrest, and consumed a whole host of other medications. I found it incredible that the Accused was still able to walk around the MRT station if he had indeed taken all the medications as he had claimed. When cross-examined by the Accused, Dr Ang Lay Teng responded candidly that she had not come across anyone who had tried to consume a whole bottle of cough syrup within a period of eight hours, and that if they had done so, they would feel “very, very unwell”[^64].

53     The Accused had a propensity to change the amount of medications and types of medication that he said he had consumed[^65] in the course of the trial. I further found that the Accused had embellished his evidence as this was not raised in his long statements (D4 and P21) or cautioned statement (P22), and only belatedly on the third day of trial. I disbelieved his claim that he had told ASP Goh about the cough syrup but she had failed to record it. There was no reason for ASP Goh not to record what the Accused had told her, nor did the Accused suggest any reason for ASP Goh’s purportedly failure to do so.

54     In any event, even if I accepted that the Accused had indeed taken the bottles of cough syrup as claimed, which I did not, there was no evidence that these cough syrup would present a false positive of methamphetamine in his urine sample. None of the witnesses who came to court were able to support the Accused’s claim. While Dr Ang initially said that pseudoephedrine may cause a positive for methamphetamine in a person’s urine, she subsequently clarified that she was not an expert on this and would defer to the opinion of the HSA analysts, as they were the experts[^66]. It was clear from Mdm Tiong’s and Mr Ng’s evidence that consumption of pseudoephedrine will not give rise to a positive for methamphetamine[^67]. I had no reason to doubt their expert opinion, nor could I think of any reason why they would fabricate evidence against the Accused and insist that pseudoephedrine would not give rise to methamphetamine in the Accused’s urine, if that was in fact the case.

55     The Accused submitted printouts giving a description of Desoxyn (D5) and Didrex (D6). However, I noted that it was not his defence that he had consumed Desoxyn or Didrex prior to his arrest[^68].

### The alleged missing cough syrup and black pill

56     I next dealt with the Accused’s belated claim that the TransCom officer and/or the arresting officers had misplaced a bottle of cough syrup and black pill. I accepted the clarification by the TransCom officers and the arresting officers that, in relation to medication or supplement, there were only three exhibits which were seized from the Accused. These were the “Kapsul Asam Urat”, the Remethan strip and the Celecoxib strip. The exhibits seized were documented in the arrest report (P2) and the acknowledgement slip (P19) signed by SI Yang Changrui Alvin (PW16) (“SI Yang”). The arrest report and the acknowledgement slip were objective proof of what was in fact seized from the Accused on that day and are not subject to the memory of these officers which might have been affected by the passage of time as it had been a year since the incident by the time of the trial. In dealing with discrepancies and/or inconsistencies of this nature, I found the observation made by Abdul Hamid J in _Chean Siong Guat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span> at \[64\] instructive:

> … In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate needs to do is to consider the discrepancies and say whether they are minor or serious discrepancies … On the other hand, if a magistrate finds the discrepancies do not detract from the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses, it would be proper for him to regard the discrepancies as trivial and ignore them.

The above observation was endorsed by Yong Pung How CJ in _Sundara Moorthy Lankathran v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 253</span> at \[40\], and by Steven Chong J (as he then was) in _Jayasekara Arachchilage Hemantha Neranjan Gamini and another v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 689</span> at \[66\]. I did not think that the credibility of these officers was impugned in any way by the inconsistency. In any event, the Accused did not suggest any reason why the officers would want to fabricate evidence against him.

57     The Accused argued strenuously that there was a break in the chain of evidence as a result of the alleged missing cough syrup and black pill. First, I accepted the evidence of the TransCom officers and the arresting officers, and found that there was no break in the chain of evidence in relation to the exhibits which were seized from the Accused on the day of arrest.

58     Second, the critical chain of evidence related to the procurement of urine sample and the sending of the urine sample for analysis, as the charge related to a consumption offence. I found that there was no break in the chain of evidence in relation to the urine sample.

59     Third, when the Accused was on the stand, he did not say that it was because he had consumed the missing cough syrup and black pill which had caused his urine to be positive for methamphetamine. Therefore, even if the cough syrup and/or the missing black pill did exist, they were not relevant to his defence that it was the list of medication that he gave in court that had caused a false positive.

60     Lastly, it was clear from the Accused’s long statement (D4) recorded on 5 August 2018 by SI Yang that at the time of arrest, the Accused had on him “one slab containing 8 tablets, one slab containing 3 tablets and a packet containing one tablet”[^69]. The description given by the Accused to SI Yang matched the exhibits which were reflected in the arrest report (P2):

> (i)     One slab of 8 Remethan 100R pink colour pills (sic);

> (ii)     One cut slab 3 white and brown capsule Celecoxib (sic); and

> (iii)     One unopened packet of “Kapsul asam ubat” (sic).

61     I found it disingenuous for the Accused to belatedly accused the TransCom officers and arresting officers when he had said in his long statement that there were only three types of medication which were recovered from him at the time of arrest.

### Disclosure obligations

62     Finally, I considered the Accused’s insistence that Prosecution had an obligation to disclose the documents listed in paras 17 to 20 of the Accused’s written submissions. The Accused cited the case of _Muhammad bin Kadar and another v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span>. However, there was a more recent Court of Appeal case dealing with this issue: _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 25</span>. At \[50\] of _Nabill_, the Court of Appeal specifically states that whether the Prosecution is required to disclose the statement of a material witness who is a prosecution witness would be determined on a future occasion. In the present case, all five officers were called as Prosecution witnesses and the Accused was in fact given two chances to cross-examine them. Regardless, the Prosecution did show the statements of the prosecution witnesses, where they were available, to the Accused.

63     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Accused had not raised a reasonable doubt to the Prosecution’s case and convicted the Accused accordingly.

## The Sentence

64     An offence under section 8(_b_)(ii) read with section 33A(2) of the MDA is punishable with a minimum term of imprisonment of seven years and a maximum term of 13 years. The offender shall also be punished with not less than six strokes and not more than 12 strokes of the cane.

65     In addition to the above, the Accused was liable to be punished with an enhanced sentence under section 50T of the Prisons Act for an imprisonment term not exceeding 535 days.

### Antecedents

66     The Accused was traced for multiple drug-related and property-related offences, and offences under the Films Act, since 1999. He was also placed under numerous drug supervision orders between 2000 and 2018.

67     Specifically for the purpose of section 33A(2) of the MDA, the Accused’s Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions showed that the Accused was convicted: (i) under section 8(_a_) of the MDA on 13 December 2000 for an offence of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug and sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment; and (ii) under section 8(_b_)(ii) read with section 33A(1) of the MDA for consumption of methamphetamine on 23 December 2014 and sentenced to five years and three months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Another charge under section 9 of the MDA for possession of utensils for consumption of a controlled drug was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

### Prosecution’s position on sentence

68     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of seven years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The Accused had claimed trial and made unfounded allegations against the enforcement officers, and so was not entitled to the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.

69     In relation to the enhanced sentence, the Prosecution assessed the Accused’s breach to be “on the medium to high end of high severity”, and that a sentence “amounting to 90% of the full term of 535 days \[was\] principled and justified”[^70].

### The mitigation plea

70     In mitigation, the Accused submitted, _inter alia_:

> (i)     he had to look after his aged mother and his young son;

> (ii)     he had done what he could to kick his addiction to cough syrup and drugs; and

> (iii)     if he were to be incarcerated for a long period, he would not be able to bond with his young son.

### Decision on sentence

71     The charge against the Accused carries a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. In addition, the Accused faced an enhanced sentence of up to 535 days under section 50T of the Prisons Act. In the circumstances, I did not agree with the Prosecution’s position for an uplift of the mandatory minimum sentence to seven years and six months’ imprisonment. I therefore imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on the Accused. Had the Accused not faced an enhanced sentence of such a substantive period, I would have considered imposing an imprisonment term which was more than the mandatory minimum.

72     I next considered the appropriate enhanced sentence under section 50T of the Prisons Act. I was mainly in agreement with the Prosecution’s position in relation to the gravity of the Accused’s breach and the level of culpability.

73     In determining whether to impose any enhanced sentence on the Accused, I took into account the following factors[^71]:

> (a)     the gravity of the offence;

> (b)     whether the offence is of a similar nature to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced;

> (c)     the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order; and

> (d)     all other relevant circumstances.

74     Given the facts of the present case, I was of the view that it was apposite to impose an enhanced sentence. I then proceeded to determine the appropriate length of the enhanced sentence.

75     I considered the gravity of the Accused’s breaching offence to be serious. The breaching offence carries a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment, which may extend to 13 years. In addition, it carries a mandatory minimum of six strokes of the cane. Furthermore, the Accused’s breaching offence was identical to the original offence which gave rise to the Remission Order, and I agreed with the Prosecution that the more similar the breaching offence is to the original offence, the graver the breach.

76     The Accused committed the breaching offence after about 100 days into the Remission Order. This constituted about 15% of the entire remission period. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that the culpability of the Accused was high.

77     In relation to the Accused’s mitigation plea, I did not find any exceptional factors. It is well established that, other than in the most exceptional or extreme circumstances, personal or financial hardships carries little mitigating value and “may not be relied on during mitigation” (_Ong Ker Seng v PP_ \[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 406 at \[30\] and _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[31\]). In any event, I did not think that the Accused faced up to his drug addiction issue. He did not admit to having consumed methamphetamine even after his conviction, insisting that he only had an addiction to cough syrup. While I have some sympathy that his relationship with his son was strained as a result of him being away because of the multiple times he was incarcerated, the Accused had no one, but himself to blame. The only way for the Accused to mend ties with his son is to have a clean break from any form of controlled/specified drugs, and to keep his addiction at bay.

78     The Accused claimed to have worked as a cleaner while he was placed under the Remission Order which took effect from 21 April 2018. However, within a month of his release, the Accused was on medical leave on numerous occasions from 18 May 2018 – he took a total of 22 days’ medical leave between 21 April 2018 and 4 August 2018, which was the day of his arrest.

79     Overall, I did not think that the Accused was fully committed to rehabilitation and had returned to his old habit of consuming controlled/specified drugs just about 100 days after he was placed on the Remission Order. Having considered the above factors and the principle of totality, I was of the view that an enhanced sentence of 430 days, which was about 100 days less than the maximum period of 535 days was appropriate.

## Conclusion

80     Having given careful consideration to the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In my view, a global sentence of seven years and 465 days’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane would adequately reflect the culpability of the Accused and would give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence.
