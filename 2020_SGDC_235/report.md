3       The sentence was backdated to 9 June 2020 when the Accused was first remanded. On 29 September 2020, the Accused filed a notice of appeal against sentence. He is currently serving his sentence.

## Facts

4       The salient portions of the Statement of Facts, to which the Accused admitted without qualification is set out in the following paragraphs in chronological order.

### Facts relating to MAC-905452-2020

5       On 22 June 2019, at about 2.44am, Police officers arrived at Block 567 Hougang Street 51, Singapore after receiving a call reporting that an “Indian guy” had “passed out”. At the scene, the Police officers observed that a paramedic was trying to tend to the Accused. The Accused suddenly charged towards the paramedic and the officers intervened.

6       The officers observed that the Accused was speaking incoherently, had an unsteady gait, and reeked of alcohol. One of the officers asked the Accused to calm down and take a seat. The Accused responded by taking off all his clothes. The Accused then held his penis and showed it to one police officer. Still holding his penis, he walked over to the paramedic and showed it to him. The Accused then let go of his penis and exposed it to all the officers at the scene. The officers and paramedic repeatedly tried to calm him down. After some time, they finally managed to get the Accused to put his shorts back on. The officers then moved in to arrest the Accused.

7       When the officers were placing the Accused under arrest, he shouted incoherently at the top of his voice and resisted arrest. The officers had to use reasonable force to restrain him from the point of arrest until he was escorted back to Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters.

8       By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has thereby committed an offence under section 20 of the MOA. Prior to the commission of the abovementioned offence, the accused was convicted of an offence under section 20 of the MOA on the following occasions:

> (a)     11 May 2015 in Court No. 23 of the Subordinate Courts, Singapore, _vide_ MAC-903336-2015;

> (b)     6 July 2015, in Court No. 18 of the Subordinate Courts, Singapore, _vide_ MAC-905381-2015;

> (c)     17 December 2015, in Court No. 23 of the Subordinate Courts, Singapore, _vide_ MAC-90992-2015;

> (d)     29 April 2016, in Court No. 19 of the Subordinate Courts, Singapore, _vide_ MAC-902827-2016; and

> (e)     20 June 2016, in Court No. 23 of the Subordinate Courts, Singapore, _vide_ MAC-904597-2016.

9       The above convictions have not been set aside to date. The accused is thereby liable for enhanced punishment under section 20 of the MOA.

### Facts relating to MAC-905974-2020

10     Pursuant to a warrant issued by the Director of Social Welfare of the Ministry of Social and Family Development under section 3(4) of the DPA on 23 May 2017, the accused was admitted to Angsana Home @ Pelangi Village, located at 14 Buangkok Green, Singapore (“Angsana Home”), where he is required to reside until he is discharged in accordance to the DPA. Angsana Home is a welfare home as defined in the DPA.

11     On 11 October 2019, at about 10.40am, the Accused left Angsana Home for an independent outing. He had obtained the permission of the Superintendent of Angsana Home to go on the said outing. He was required to return to Angsana Home by 11.59pm on the same day but had failed to do so. The Accused admitted that after he left for the outing, he had no intention to return to Angsana Home. Instead, the Accused stayed in the Geylang area for about a week until he was found by the Police.

12     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under section 16(c) of the DPA.

### Facts relating to DAC-909766-2020

13     On 15 January 2020, the Accused was arrested in Haig Road Market and Food Centre by a party of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers on suspicion of drug-related offences. The Accused was searched and one red packet containing several rolled-up tobacco papers were recovered from him. The accused was then brought back to the CNB office located at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations.

14     At Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters, the accused provided two bottles of his urine sample which were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. On 22 and 28 January 2020, the HAS issued two certificates under Section 16 of the MDA, stating that the Accused’s urine samples were found to contain 2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group.

15     2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

16     The Accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume 2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group.

17     The Accused has thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(i) of the MDA. Further, before the commission of the said offence, the Accused was, on 10 April 2002, pursuant to an order made by the Deputy Director of the CNB in Singapore under section 34(2)(b) of the MDA, admitted to an approved institution, namely, Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre, for consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, morphine, and he is thereby liable to be punished under section 33(4AA) of the MDA.

### Facts relating to MAC-905060-2020

18     On 23 January 2020, the Accused was in a dormitory in Angsana Home. At about 4.30am, intending to escape, he got up from his wheelchair and pushed and kicked an aluminium panel on the left side of the room. After about 15 minutes, the Accused dislodged the aluminium panel, creating a gap in the wall. At about 4.49am, the Accused escaped the room through the gap. This was captured on CCTV and witnessed by another resident of Angsana Home.

19     The Accused then headed for the exit of Angsana Home. Upon being spotted by a staff member of Angsana Home, the Accused climbed over a fence and ran in the direction of Block 565 Hougang Street 51, Singapore.

20     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused left Angsana Home without permission of the Superintendent of Angsana Home. He has thereby committed an offence under section 16(b) of the DPA.

### Facts relating to DAC-909768-2020

21     On 30 January 2020, a party of CNB officers arrested the Accused at Block 14 Haig Road Market and Food Centre, on suspicion of drug-related offences.

22     The Accused was searched and the following was recovered from him:

> (a)     one rolled-up paper containing vegetable matter (later marked “AMC-A”);

> (b)     one packet of tobacco rolling paper and one lighter; and

> (c)     one empty packet of ‘Stormking’.

23     The Accused was then brought back to the CNB office located at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations.

24     On 31 January 2020, exhibit “AMC-A” was sealed and sent to the HSA for analysis. On 21 February 2020, HSA issued a certificate under Section 16 of the MDA stating that on analysis, exhibit “AMC-A” was found to be one paper roll containing not less than 0.17 gram of vegetable matter, and MDMB-4en-PINACA and 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the butyl group were detected in the vegetable matter.

25     MDMB-4en-PINACA is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

26     The Accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess MDMB-4en-PINACA. He has thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA.

### Facts relating to MAC-905110-2020

27     On 5 April 2020, at about 6.16am, one Santhakumar s/o Govindasamy, a resident of Angsana Home (“the Victim”), was collecting his medication at the dispensary of Angsana Home before heading out to work. The Accused saw the Victim and decided to assault him because he was under the impression that the Victim had been informing the management of Angsana Home of his whereabouts. The Accused approached the Victim and hit him once on the back of his head using his walking stick, causing the Victim’s head to bleed. The assault was captured on CCTV.

28     Following the assault, the staff of Angsana Home separated the Accused and the Victim. The Victim was conveyed to Sengkang General Hospital for medical attention. A medical report dated 20 April 2020 from Sengkang General Hospital stated that the Victim sustained a head injury and laceration as a result of the assault, and that his wounds were closed with eight sutures using Ethilon on the right side of his parietal scalp and three sutures using Ethilon on the left side of his parietal scalp. He was also given antibiotic ointment and three days’ medical leave from 5 April 2020 to 7 April 2020.

29     From the foregoing, the Accused has thereby committed an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code.

### Facts relating to MAC-905977-2020

30     On 15 April 2020, at about 1.30pm, the Victim was queueing to collect his daily medication at the dispensary in Angsana Home. The Accused suddenly approached the Victim and hit him several times on the head with a walking stick, causing the Victim’s head to bleed.

31     Following the assault, the staff of Angsana Home subdued and restrained the Accused. The victim was conveyed to Sengkang General Hospital for medical attention. A medical report dated 5 May 2020 from Sengkang General Hospital stated that the Victim sustained a 1cm superficial laceration over his left temporal scalp. He received two stitches and was given a tetanus vaccination. He was prescribed with antibiotic ointment and oral analgesia on discharge.

32     The Accused admitted to planning the assault on the victim for a few days prior to its commission. He had borrowed the walking stick from another resident of Angsana Home and was biding his time for an opportunity to assault the Victim. The Accused wanted to assault the victim as he was under the impression that the victim had been spreading rumours about him.

33     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under section 17(b) of the DPA.

## Charges taken into consideration

34     The Accused also admitted to 8 other charges and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, as follows:

36     In addition, the Accused was placed under drug supervision for 2 years on 4 occasions (10/10/1977, 19/11/1981, 04/02/1990, 01/10/2003). He was also twice committed to Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) – for 6 months on 11/04/1977, and for an initial 6 months on 10/04/2002 which was subsequently extended to 12 months.

38     The Prosecution made oral submissions at the hearing to justify the sentences stated above. The Court was urged to run the following 3 sentences consecutively, which would result in an overall sentence of 3 years’, 3 months’ and 24 weeks’ imprisonment:

> (a)     DAC-909766-2020: 3 years 3 months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     MAC-905110-2020: 4 weeks’ imprisonment; and

> (c)     MAC-905452-2020: 20 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Mitigation

39     The Accused claimed that he was a destitute person, his family had abandoned him and he had tried to commit suicide. He claimed that his problems began when he was admitted into the welfare home, because the residents there had tried to take advantage of him. He admitted he has anger management issues and sought the Court’s assistance to recommend him to IMH for programmes which will help him control his anger. Finally, he claimed that he had kept away from drugs for a very long time.

## The Court’s decision on sentence

40     Having heard both the Prosecution and the Accused, I agreed in most part with the positions taken by the Prosecution on sentence, for the reasons stated below.

### DAC-909766-2020: Consumption of controlled drug

41     For the consumption of 2-\[1\[(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid on or about 15 January 2020, the Accused faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment under section 33(4AA) of the MDA because he had previously been admitted to DRC for consumption of morphine. In sentencing the Accused for this offence, I kept in mind the guiding principle that “consumption of drugs is a grave menace and an anathema to the fabric and well-being of society and must be uncompromisingly stamped out.” (_Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> _(“Dinesh Singh”)_ at \[59\]). The predominant sentencing objective here would be one of deterrence, both general and specific.

42     The Prosecution sought a 3 months uplift above the mandatory minimum sentence. I agreed that this uplift was appropriate and justified, having considered these aggravating factors:

> (a)     The Accused had 2 other drug consumption charges which were to be taken into consideration (DAC-909767-2020 and DAC-914851-2020), both of which also attracted the mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years. It is trite law that the effect of taking into consideration outstanding charges (particularly charges that are similar) would be to enhance the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed in respect of the proceeded charge (_PP v UI_ \[2008\] 4 SLR (R) 500 at \[38\]). Notably, all three drug consumption offences were committed on different dates. This meant that after the Accused was brought back to a police station to provide urine samples on suspicion of drug consumption on 15 January 2020, he continued to consume the controlled drug on 31 January 2020 and 16 March 2020, the subject matters of the outstanding charges.

> (b)     The Accused also has a long history of drug abuse, albeit that his last conviction for a drug offence happened some time ago. He was twice convicted and sentenced for consumption of a controlled drug. In addition, the Accused had also been admitted to the DRC twice, back in 1977 and then again in 2002.

43     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a 3 months uplift from the mandatory minimum imprisonment sentence would be appropriate to achieve the objective of specific deterrence against the Accused, and imposed a 3 years’ and 3 months’ imprisonment sentence accordingly for this offence.

### DAC-909768-2020: Possession of Class A controlled drug

44     For the offence of possession of the Class A controlled drug (MDMB-4en-PINACA) on or about 30 January 2020, the Prosecution submitted that an 8 months’ imprisonment should be imposed, to be run concurrently.

45     I agreed with the Prosecution that an 8 months’ sentence would be appropriate for this offence. The High Court in _Dinesh Singh_ has made clear that “all drug offences involving the possession or consumption of Class A drugs inexorably attract custodial sentences” (at \[59\]), and following _Dinesh Singh_, the usual tariff meted out in the State Courts for such offences has been between 8 to 12 months’ imprisonment (_Public Prosecutor v Burge Christopher David_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 218</span> at \[62\]). As the Accused in the present case was neither a young offender nor a first-time user of drugs, and given the absence of any mitigating factor in his favour, I was of the view that an 8 months’ imprisonment sentence was appropriate and imposed the same for the drug possession offence.

### MAC-905060-2020 and MAC-905974-2020: Leaving and failing to return to the welfare home without permission

46     Section 16 of the DPA states as follows:

> Any person who —

>> (_a_)    escapes from the police while committed to the charge of the police under this Act;

>> (_b_)    without permission of the superintendent, leaves a welfare home in which the person is required to reside in accordance with section 3 or to which the person has been admitted on his own application under section 5; or

>> (_c_)    having obtained the permission of the superintendent left a welfare home for a limited time or for a specified purpose, fails to return at the expiration of such time or when such purpose has been accomplished or found to be impracticable,

> shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months.

47     The Accused, who was admitted to a welfare home in accordance with section 3 of the DPA, committed two section 16 DPA offences on different dates:

> (a)     For MAC-905974-2020, the Accused failed to return to the welfare home on time on 11 October 2019, an offence under s 16(c) of the DPA.

> (b)     For MAC-905060-2020, the Accused left the welfare home without the permission of the Superintendent on 23 January 2020, an offence under s 16(b) of the DPA.

48     The Prosecution highlighted that there was only one known precedent for a section 16 DPA offence, which was an unreported decision: _PP_ v _Cheong Kwok Keen_ (SC-904997-2018) (“_Cheong Kwok Keen_”). In that case, the accused was a destitute person admitted to a welfare home pursuant to the DPA. He was given permission to go for a medical appointment and a movie outing (each outing formed the subject of a separate proceeded charge). On the outings, he absconded and failed to return to the welfare home by the stipulated time. He was sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment for each charge, which were run consecutively to amount to a 4 weeks’ overall imprisonment sentence. Relying on _Cheong Kwok Keen_, the Prosecution urged the Court to similarly impose a 2 weeks’ imprisonment sentence for each of the section 16 DPA offences in the present case.

49     The parliamentary debates reveal that Parliament had, back in 1989, recognised the problem of residents absconding from welfare homes to be a concerning one, which led to an increase in the maximum imprisonment sentence for such offences (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (26 January 1989) vol 52 at col 584 (Wong Kang Seng, Minister for Community Development)):

> Government welfare homes are also not a penal institution. Life there, although not luxurious, is decent. Residents are well treated. They have three meals a day, clean beds and recreational facilities. There are work programmes for those who can work and such persons receive an allowance. Hence, there is no reason for a person in a welfare home to abscond. Yet over the past three years, an average of 159 residents absconded annually. _It is a sheer waste of time and manpower and public funds to round up a person time and again to have him abscond again_. During the last three years, of the 660 persons picked up, 220 were abscondees and 168 were ex-residents of welfare homes. The ex-residents were discharged to their care-person but they refused to settle down and reverted to begging as it was easy.

> _The penalty for abscondence will therefore be increased from a term not exceeding three months imprisonment to a term not exceeding six months imprisonment, so as to discourage abscondence_.

> There is also a new provision to provide for a fine not exceeding $3,000 or imprisonment term not exceeding two years for disorderly behaviour in the welfare home.

> \[emphasis added\]

50     In light of the underlying rationale behind the punishment prescribed in section 16 DPA, I was of the view that a 2 weeks’ imprisonment sentence for each of the section 16 DPA offences here was justified and appropriate, for the following reasons:

> (a)     The Accused had consented to a charge of a similar nature (MAC-905976-2020) to be taken into consideration, where he had left the welfare home without the permission of the Superintendent on 28 December 2019. He had therefore absconded, or failed to return to the welfare home, on _3 separate occasions, within 3.5 months_ (11 October 2019, 28 December 2019, 23 January 2020). The Accused’s track record of absconding from the welfare home suggests that he was one resident where a “_sheer waste of time and manpower and public funds \[would have been expended\] to round \[him up\] time and again to have him abscond again_”. A significant imprisonment sentence was therefore justified in the present case to “_discourage abscondence_” on the part of residents like the Accused.

> (b)     I considered that the circumstances in which he had committed the offence in MAC-905060-2020 on 23 January 2020 to be particularly aggravating. The Accused did not simply just leave the welfare home without permission. He had “kicked an aluminium panel on the left side of the room \[for 15 minutes\] creating a gap in the wall” and escaped through it, in the presence of another resident in the welfare home. Despite being spotted near the exit, he climbed over a fence to escape the welfare home before running into a nearby HDB estate. The brazen behaviour and defiance towards authority the Accused displayed whilst committing the offence justified, in my view, a 2 weeks’ imprisonment sentence to be imposed on him for the section 16(b) DPA offence.

51     For the foregoing reasons, I imposed a 2 weeks’ imprisonment sentence for each of the section 16 DPA offences which the Accused pleaded guilty to.

### MAC-905110-2020: Voluntarily causing hurt

52     For the Accused’s section 323 Penal Code offence of voluntarily causing hurt to the Victim (a resident of Angsana Home) on 5 April 2020, the Prosecution submitted that a 4 weeks’ imprisonment sentence be imposed. The Prosecution relied on the High Court decision of _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”) during oral submissions to justify the sentence it was seeking.

53     In _Low Song Chye_ at \[77\]-\[78\], the High Court established the following sentencing framework for a first-time offender who pleads guilty to a section 323 Penal Code offence:

> (a)     First, the court should identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused by the offence. The various sentencing bands and indicative sentencing ranges were set out as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.82%"> <col width="46.24%"> <col width="34.94%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Hurt caused</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative sentencing range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">term up to four weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between four weeks’ to six</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24 months’</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (b)     Next, the court should make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors.

54     Applying _Low Song Chye_, I agreed with the Prosecution that the offence committed by the Prosecution fell within Band 1, as the harm caused to the Victim was fortunately not so severe. It was clear however that the custodial threshold was crossed, and I was persuaded by the Prosecution that the offence fell closer to the _higher end_ of Band 1. This was because the Accused’s act was a premeditated one where he had used his walking stick to hit the Victim’s head, a vulnerable part of the body, causing the Victim’s head to bleed which required the wounds to be closed with eight sutures.

55     The Prosecution also referred to two precedents to justify imposing a 4 weeks’ imprisonment sentence. Having considered these precedents, I decided to impose a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment instead (which would still be at the higher end of Band 1), as both precedents contain factors that aggravated the respective offenders’ culpabilities, which were absent from the present case:

> (a)     In _PP v Andrew Koh Weiwen_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 103</span> (“_Andrew Koh_”), the offender, who pleaded guilty, had _used a glass bottle to hit the victim’s head which broke upon impact_. The offender then followed up to _elbow the victim_ on the nose when the victim was trying to stop the offender from attacking him further. The offender was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment by the High Court. I was of the view that the manner in which the object was used in _Andrew Koh_ to hurt the victim (a glass bottle) was more dangerous than the Accused’s use of the walking stick in the present case. As the High Court in _Andrew Koh_ pointed out, the fact that the bottle “smashed upon impact on the victim’s head \[indicates\] the substantial amount of force used … The sharp edges of a broken bottle can potentially cause deep lacerations and serious bodily injuries” (_Andrew Koh_ at \[32\]). Moreover, the offender in _Andrew Koh_ had followed up to elbow the victim on the nose. As the Statement of Facts in the present case merely recorded that the Accused had hit the Victim once for the section 323 Penal Code offence, I was of the view that the culpability of the offender in _Andrew Koh_ exceeded that of the Accused in the present case.

> (b)     In _PP v Parienan s/o Arunsalam_ (MA 9355/2017), the offender had attacked _his wife_ by hitting her forehead _with a ceramic plate_. This was _done in the presence of their daughter_. The offender had also _claimed trial_, and was convicted and sentenced to 1 month imprisonment. In contrast, the Accused had pleaded guilty here, and he had not committed an act of domestic violence.

56     Given that I had found the Accused’s culpability to be lesser than the offenders in the precedents cited, I imposed a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the section 323 Penal Code offence.

### MAC-905977-2020: Repeatedly assaulting victim in welfare home

57     Section 17(b) of the DPA stipulates that “any person residing in a welfare home who … repeatedly assaults any other person residing in the welfare home … shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years”.

58     The Accused committed the section 17(b) DPA offence against the same Victim, a few days after he had committed the section 323 Penal Code offence. On 15 April 2020, the Accused approached the Victim and hit him _several times_ on the head with a walking stick, causing his head to bleed again.

59     There were no reported decisions on section 17(b) of the DPA, and the Prosecution also informed the Court that no unreported decision could be found. While the parliamentary debates (see above at \[49\]) did not shed light on why this new provision was introduced, it could reasonably be surmised that this provision was deemed necessary to protect the safety and well-being of destitute persons who are instituted in welfare homes.

60     The Prosecution sought to align the sentence to be imposed here with the sentence it had submitted for the section 323 Penal Code offence, _ie_ 4 weeks’ imprisonment. I was of the view that this approach is justifiable for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, the prescribed sentences for both offences were quite similar. A section 323 Penal Code offence, prior to 1 January 2020, attracted _an imprisonment sentence for a term not exceeding 2 years_, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both. A section 17 DPA offence similarly attracted _an imprisonment sentence for a term not exceeding 2 years_, or with fine which may extend to $3,000.

> (b)     Second, the elements required to prove a section 17(b) DPA offence would in most instances equally make out a section 323 Penal Code offence. This was certainly true for the present case as the Accused’s assault on the Victim with his walking stick could easily have been the subject of a section 323 Penal Code charge.

61     I then proceeded to consider that had the Prosecution framed a section 323 Penal Code charge against the Accused for his acts on 15 April 2020 against the Victim, I would not have hesitated to impose a 4 weeks’ imprisonment sentence. In my view, a 4 weeks’ imprisonment sentence would not be excessive for such an offence for the following reasons:

> (a)     This was the _second time_ in the same month where the Accused had assaulted the same Victim, in an act which was clearly premeditated. This time, the Accused hit the Victim not only once but _several times_ on the head with a walking stick, causing the Victim to bleed and to receive two stitches on his head.

> (b)     The Accused is heavily traced for violent offences (see above at \[35\]), and his antecedents include a 5 year corrective training term for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt.

> (c)     There were two other charges to be taken into consideration where the Accused had similarly used violence against two different victims within the same welfare home (MAC-905109-2020 and MAC-905975-2020). His assault on the Victim therefore did not appear to be an isolated incident. Rather, he has proven to be a clear threat to the physical safety of destitute persons housed in an institution where they are supposed to be protected and cared for.

62     Given the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that the 4 weeks’ imprisonment sentence the Prosecution had urged the Court to impose for the section 17(b) DPA offence was appropriate and could not be said to be excessive; and therefore imposed the same on the Accused.

### MAC-905452-2020: Disorderly and indecent behaviour in public

63     Section 20 of the MOA provides that “any person who is found guilty of any riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour in any public road or in any public place … shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.”

64     On 22 June 2019, the Accused behaved in a disorderly and indecent manner in the vicinity of Block 567 Hougang Street 51, where he had, while reeking of alcohol, exposed his penis to two police officers and a paramedic; before shouting incoherently at the top of his voice and resisting the police officers’ arrest.

65     As reflected in the charge, this would be, since 11 May 2015, the _sixth_ time where the Accused has been convicted and sentenced for this offence, making him liable once again for enhanced punishment. The previous 5 occasions had resulted in the following sentences:

> (a)     11 May 2015: Fine of $1,000

> (b)     6 July 2015: 3 weeks’ imprisonment

> (c)     17 December 2015: 6 weeks’ imprisonment

> (d)     29 April 2016: 6 weeks’ imprisonment

> (e)     20 June 2016: 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

66     The Prosecution submitted that a 20 weeks’ imprisonment sentence should be imposed for this latest offence.

67     Clearly, the Accused has not been sufficiently deterred by his 5 previous, escalating sentences, and I was thus of the view that a _significant uplift_ from the previous sentence he had received was necessary to deter him from committing such offences again, to secure the peace and safety of the public.

68     In addition, I was compelled to take into account the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     The Prosecution revealed that for his previous section 20 MOA offences in 2016, the Accused was convicted and sentenced for shouting loudly and gesticulating wildly in a public place. In the present case, not only was the Accused shouting loudly in the wee hours within a public housing estate, he had resisted _the police officers’ arrest_ and _exposed his penis to the police officers and the paramedic who had attended to him_. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that the manner in which he committed the offence in the present case was far more aggravating compared to his previous antecedents, and the sentence imposed for this latest offence would have to properly reflect that.

> (b)     The Accused had committed this offence while “reeking of alcohol”. There was also a charge of causing annoyance whilst drunk in a public place punishable under section 14(2) of the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act 2015 to be taken into consideration (MAC-905947-2020), an act which had taken place a few months _after_ he had committed the present section 20 MOA offence. The Accused’s act of committing such offences while intoxicated has been recognised by the High Court in _Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span> at \[44\] as an aggravating factor which has to be “emphatically discouraged”:

>> Singapore, being a cosmopolitan city state reputed for its safe environment, cannot risk allowing alcohol-related offending to spiral out of control. This danger is an ever lurking one and it is in the community's interest that public drunkenness and its attendant disruptive conduct must not be allowed to take root here in Singapore. No intoxicated individual must be given the licence to roam public streets at night spoiling for trouble and/or behave in a disorderly and loutish manner. Such behaviour must be emphatically discouraged. I am therefore of the unwavering opinion that a sentencing judge should _ordinarily_ take into account an offender's intoxication as an aggravating consideration. Those who voluntarily imbibe alcohol must, in the usual course of events, take full responsibility for their subsequent offending.

69     Having considered all of the factors above, I was of the view that the sentence to be imposed for this offence had to be _substantially higher_ than the 12 weeks’ imprisonment sentence which the Accused had last received, for the purpose of specific deterrence. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that a 20 weeks’ imprisonment sentence was appropriate and justified for the Accused’s section 20 MOA offence, and imposed the same accordingly.

### The overall sentence

70     Of the 7 sentences imposed, I agreed with the Prosecution to run 3 of the sentences consecutively. In doing so, I took guidance from the general rule established by the High Court that “sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively” (_Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen Balakrishnan_”) at \[98(b)\]). Applying this general rule, I decided that the drug consumption offence (DAC-909766-2020), the offence of disorderly and indecent behaviour in public (DAC-905452-2020) and the offence of repeatedly assaulting a victim in a welfare home (MAC-905977-2020) should run consecutively. These offences were all unrelated, involved the invasion of different legally protected interests, and had occurred on different dates.

71     With these 3 offences being run consecutively, the overall sentence imposed on the Accused would add up to an imprisonment term of 3 years, 3 months, and 24 weeks:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="19.82%"> <col width="55.18%"> <col width="25%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge Number</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence to be run consecutively</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-909766-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 8(b)(i) p/u section 33(4AA) of the MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>3 years’ and 3 months’ imprisonment</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-905452-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 20 of the MOA (enhanced)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>20 weeks’ imprisonment</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-905977-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 17(b) of the DPA</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>4 weeks’ imprisonment</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

72     I took a last look at the end of the sentencing process to “ensure that the aggregate sentence is proportionate to the overall criminality presented and not excessive” (_Raveen Balakrishnan_ at \[65\]). I was satisfied that the overall imprisonment sentence of 3 years, 3 months and 24 weeks was indeed proportionate and not excessive, considering that:

> (a)     the Accused had committed 15 offences (3 of which attracted a mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years) over a span of 10 months, on 12 separate dates;

> (b)     the Accused was heavily traced for _relevant_ offences; and

> (c)     there was no mitigating factor which I could take into account in the Accused’s favour, except the fact that he had pleaded guilty.

73     As the Accused claimed during mitigation that he has anger management issues and might benefit from professional help, I directed that a Criminal Court Conference be convened _post-sentencing_, for the specialists in the State Courts Centre for Specialist Services to assess the Accused’s underlying cause for his repeat offending behaviour, so that he may be referred (if appropriate) to any resource agencies or IMH programmes.

74     The Accused had also highlighted to me that his mother had recently passed away, and that as the eldest son, he was obliged to fast and perform certain religious rituals for more than 100 days, which he claimed to have been allowed to do so where he was kept in remand. As he had pleaded to be able to continue doing so, I made the following direction to Prisons:

> Accused claims that he has been allowed to fast and perform certain religious rituals whilst in remand, as his mother passed away earlier in September. If true, kindly try to accommodate his similar requests if possible so that he can continue to do so in Prisons, subject to Prisons’ rules and regulations.

## Conclusion

75     In conclusion, I was of the view that the overall imprisonment sentence of 3 years, 3 months and 24 weeks which I had imposed on the Accused was appropriate and justified.
