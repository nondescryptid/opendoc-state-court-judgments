Civil Procedure – Jurisdiction – Forum non conveniens

Rules of Court – Service – Setting aside

Tort – Defamation

10 May 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       The Defendant, a resident and citizen of Vietnam, published a number of posts on her Facebook page in the Vietnamese language. The Plaintiffs, a Singapore company and its two locally-resident shareholders of Vietnamese descent, claimed that these Facebook posts are targeted at smearing the Plaintiffs’ reputation amongst the Vietnamese community in Singapore. The Plaintiffs commenced proceedings in Singapore and limited their claims to losses suffered here. In these circumstances, which is the _forum conveniens_ for the Plaintiffs’ claims – Singapore or Vietnam?

2       This is the main question I had to answer in these two related applications. If Singapore is the _forum conveniens_, then a further issue I have to decide is whether certain orders granted on an _ex parte_ basis for substituted service should be set aside for procedural irregularities and/or lack of full and frank disclosure.

3       Having considered parties’ submissions in detail, I am of the view that Singapore is the _forum conveniens_ and the orders for substituted service should not be set aside. These are the grounds of my decision.

## Factual and Procedural Background

### Factual Background

4       The 1st Plaintiff (“**Jarta**”) in District Court Suit No 1490 of 2021 (“**DC 1490**”) is a Singapore company and a travel agent licensed by the Singapore Tourism Board. Jarta provides tours and travel packages for tourists in Singapore.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

5       The 2nd Plaintiff in DC 1490 (“**Jane**”) is a director and shareholder of Jarta.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Jane currently resides in Singapore.[^3]

6       The Plaintiff (“**Angie**”) in District Court Suit No 1448 of 2021 (“**DC 1448**”) is also a shareholder of Jarta.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) Angie is a Vietnamese citizen but resides in Singapore.[^5] Angie is a member of the Liaison Committee of the Vietnamese Community in Singapore which, according to her, is the sole community organisation established to officially represent, develop and foster the Vietnamese community living in Singapore and endorsed by the Vietnam Embassy in Singapore.[^6]

7       Unless otherwise specified in this judgment, I will refer to Angie, Jane and Jarta collectively as the “**Plaintiffs**”.

8       The Defendant (“**Bich Ha**”) in both DC 1490 and DC 1448 is the same person. She is a Vietnamese businesswoman who resides there. Bich Ha is a shareholder of the Transviet Travel Group (“**Transviet**”) which runs a variety of businesses in Vietnam, including travel agency and air-cargo businesses.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

9       Bich Ha had a close personal and business relationship with one Mr. Nguyen Hai (“**Hai**”). Hai and Bich Ha used to live together in Vietnam and were also business partners in Transviet.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

10     Sometime in February 2021, Hai allegedly told Bich Ha that he (i.e. Hai) wanted to pursue a serious relationship with Angie (i.e. Plaintiff in DC 1448) and admitted to having had sexual relations with Angie.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) Bich Ha felt betrayed by this, and suspected that Angie got close to Hai in order to procure air-cargo business from Transviet (since Hai was a shareholder of Transviet then).[^10] Bich Ha then spoke to a number of people who allegedly confirmed her suspicion regarding Angie’s intentions.[^11] Bich Ha tried to warn Hai to beware of Angie but Hai was not persuaded.[^12]

11     It was in this context that Bich Ha wrote 15 allegedly defamatory posts on her Facebook account between March to June 2021 (“**Facebook Posts**”). These Facebook Posts were written in the Vietnamese language and, by Bich Ha’s own admission, were “_written in relation to Angie’s conduct_”, even though Angie was not specifically named in these posts.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

12     Angie claims that these Facebook Posts are defamatory because the gist and/or insinuation of these posts is that Angie is a dishonest and deceptive woman, a liar and/or a sexually promiscuous woman who used sexual favours to prey on wealthy men for personal gains. As for Jarta and Jane, their claims relate to five of these Facebook Posts, which allegedly contained references to either Jarta and/or “_one of Jarta’s shareholders_” and suggested that they engaged in bribery and/or corrupt practices.

13     To be clear:

> (a)     the matters set out in paragraph \[10\] above are based on Bich Ha’s account, and disputed by Angie; and

> (b)     the matters set out in paragraph \[12\] above are based on the Plaintiffs’ pleaded case in DC 1448 and DC 1490, and not admitted by Bich Ha. Specifically, although Bich Ha admits to having authored the Facebook Posts, she does not accept the accuracy of the English translations of the Facebook Posts procured by the Plaintiffs.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

### Procedural Background

14     Bich Ha filed similar applications in DC 1448 and DC 1490 to set aside the service of the originating processes on her:

> (a)     Summons No. 4631/2021 (“**Sum 4631**”) is Bich Ha’s application filed in DC 1448 to set aside DC/ORC 2950/2021 (granting leave for serve out of jurisdiction) and DC/ORC 3548/2021 (granting leave for substituted service).

> (b)     Summons No. 4632/2021 (“**Sum 4632**”) is the Bich Ha’s application filed in DC 1490 to set aside DC/ORC 3828/2021 (granting leave for serve out of jurisdiction) and DC/ORC 3636/2021 (granting leave for substituted service).

> (DC/ORC 2950/2021 and DC/ORC 3828/2021 shall collectively be referred to as the “**Service Out Orders**” and DC/ORC 3548/2021 and DC/ORC 3636/2021 shall collectively be referred to as the “**Sub Service Orders**”)

## Parties’ Positions

16     The parties’ positions in these applications are relatively straight-forward.

17     The Defendant says that the service of originating processes on her should be set aside for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, the Service Out Orders should be set aside because Singapore is not the proper forum for the claims in DC 1448 and DC 1490. Instead, these claims should be determined in the Vietnamese courts. Various reasons were cited but the primary ones are that (i) the Facebook Posts are written in the Vietnamese language and the Vietnam courts would be better placed to interpret them; and (ii) a few of the witnesses which Bich Ha intends to call are in Vietnam.

> (b)     Second, even if Singapore is the proper forum for the claims, the Sub Service Orders should be set aside because the Plaintiffs have not taken sufficient effort to ascertain the Defendant’s residential address in Vietnam with a view to effecting personal service on her in Vietnam. Further, the Plaintiffs failed to make full and frank disclosure of certain matters when it applied for the Sub Service Orders.

18     The Plaintiffs unsurprisingly submit that the Service Out Orders and the Sub Service Orders should not be set aside. They gave the following reasons:

> (a)     First, Service Out Orders should stand because Singapore is the proper forum for the claims. The Plaintiffs and their witnesses are all resident in Singapore. More importantly, the Facebook Posts are targeted at smearing the Plaintiffs’ reputation amongst the Vietnamese population in Singapore, and damage is suffered here. The fact that the Facebook Posts are written in Vietnamese is a non-issue, since English translations can be easily procured. As for the Defendant’s professed intention to call witnesses in Vietnam, the Plaintiffs say that (i) these are not material witnesses; and (ii) the Defendant has not shown that these witnesses are unwilling to give evidence in Singapore.

> (b)     Second, the Sub Service Orders should stand because the Plaintiffs took reasonable steps to ascertain the Defendant’s residential address before making applications for the Sub Service Orders. Further, the Plaintiffs had disclosed all material facts known to them at the time of these applications. In any event, the manner of substituted service proved effective in bringing the proceedings to the Defendant’s notice, and the Sub Service Orders should not be set aside for minor procedural irregularities.

19     Given the parties’ positions, the following issues arose for consideration:

> (a)     Whether Singapore is the more appropriate forum (compared to Vietnam) for the resolution of the dispute in DC 1448 and DC 1490 (the “**Forum Issue**”)? If Singapore is not the more appropriate forum, then the Service Out Orders should be set aside.

> (b)     If Singapore is the more appropriate forum, then whether the Sub Service Orders should nonetheless be set aside (the “**Sub Service Issue**”) because:

>> (i)       The Plaintiffs failed to show that it was “_impracticable_” to effect personal service on the Defendant in Vietnam; and/or

>> (ii)       The Plaintiffs failed to make full and frank disclosures when obtaining the Sub Service Orders.

## My Decision

### The law

20     The applicable legal principles for determining whether Singapore is the appropriate forum for the purposes of service out are well established:

> (a)     When a foreign defendant is sued in Singapore and the plaintiff applies for leave to serve the originating process out of jurisdiction, the plaintiff must show (amongst others) that Singapore is the proper forum: see _Zoom Communications Ltd v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 500</span> (“**_Zoom_**”) at \[70\].

> (b)     The burden of proving that Singapore is the proper forum lies on the plaintiff when the foreign defendant (having been served out of jurisdiction) comes to Singapore to contest the jurisdiction of the Singapore court: see _Zoom_ at \[71\] and \[72\].

> (c)     The test in determining whether Singapore is the proper forum is the first stage of the test set out under _Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd _<span class="citation">\[1987\] AC 460</span> (“**_Spiliada_**”): see _Oro Negro Drilling Pte Ltd and others v Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro SAPI de CV and others and another appeal (Jesus Angel Guerra Mendez, non-party)_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 226</span> (“**_Oro Negro_**”) at \[80(c)\].

> (d)     Under this test, Singapore would be the proper forum if it had the most real and substantial connection with the disputes raised: see _JIO Minerals FZC v Mineral Enterprises Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 391</span> (“**_JIO Minerals_**”) at \[38\].

> (e)     The plaintiff only needed to demonstrate that Singapore is the _more_ appropriate forum, regardless whether it is so “_by a hair or by a mile_”: see _Siemens AG v Holdrich Investment Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 1007</span> (“**_Siemens_**”) at \[8\].

21     As for the application to set aside the Sub Service Orders, the applicable principles are also trite:

> (a)     Where a document is to be served personally, the court may make an order for substituted service to be effected instead if it appears to the court that “_it is impracticable for any reason to serve that document personally on that person_”: see Order 62 r 5 of Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“**ROC**”).

> (b)     An application for substituted service is made _ex parte_. In such applications, the applicant has a duty to make full and frank disclosure to the court of all matters which might be material to the application and which are reasonably within its knowledge, even if these matters are prejudicial to the applicant: see _The “Vasiliy Golovnin”_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 994</span> (“**_Vasiliy Golovnin_**”) at \[83\].

> (c)     Where substituted service on a foreign defendant was (i) effective in bringing notice of the claim to the attention of the foreign defendant; (ii) permitted under the laws of the foreign country, but (iii) invalid because of certain failure to comply with a procedural requirement under the ROC, the court should look at the issue “_in the round_” to decide whether the procedural irregularity ought to be cured. The court should consider, amongst others: (i) the blameworthiness of the respective parties; (ii) whether the plaintiff had made a good faith effort to comply with the rules; (iii) whether the defendant would be prejudiced if the court’s discretion were exercised in the plaintiff’s favour; and (iv) the reasons which caused the non-compliance: see _Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 625</span> (“**_Humpuss_**”) at \[92\].

22     The foregoing legal principles are not in dispute between the parties.

### The Forum Issue

23     The Defendant argues that Vietnam is the more appropriate forum in this case because:

> (a)     The Facebook Posts are written in Vietnamese, and the Vietnam courts are best placed to interpret these statements to determine (i) whether the Facebook Posts make sufficient reference to the Plaintiffs; (ii) the “_sting_” in the Facebook Posts; and (iii) whether the Facebook Posts are justified.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

> (b)     All of the parties’ witnesses are Vietnamese nationals and speak Vietnamese.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

> (c)     At least two of the witnesses whom the Defendant wishes to call are located in Vietnam, and therefore not compellable to give evidence before the Singapore courts.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

24     The Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that Singapore is the more appropriate forum than Vietnam because:

> (a)     The Facebook Posts are directed at smearing the Plaintiffs’ reputation in Singapore.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

> (b)     The Plaintiffs’ key witnesses are all based in Singapore.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

> (c)     The Plaintiffs’ claims in DC 1448 and DC 1490 are limited to damages suffered in Singapore.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

25     The Forum Issue is determined by considering the various “_connecting factors_” to the dispute, including the location of the parties, the location of the relevant witnesses and evidence, the connection to the events and transactions, the governing law, the presence of other proceedings and the shape of the litigation: see _JIO Minerals_ at \[41\] and \[42\].

26     In evaluating the connecting factors, it is the _quality_ and not the quantity which matters: see _Oro Negro_ at \[80(c)\]. Connections which have no or little bearing on adjudication of the issues in dispute will carry little weight. While there is a natural emphasis on the minimisation of expense and inconvenience of trial, the true test is _appropriateness_: see _JIO Minerals_ at \[41\].

27     I will review each of the connecting factors, before considering them in the round.

#### Residence and place of business of the parties

28     Jarta is a Singapore company and its business operations are primarily in Singapore.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

29     Jane and Angie are Vietnamese nationals, but they both reside and work in Singapore.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

30     Bich Ha is a Vietnamese national. She resides and works in Vietnam.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23)

####    Witnesses

31     The parties intend to call the following witnesses:

> _Angie (i.e. the DC 1448 Plaintiff)_

> (a)     Angie, located in Singapore;[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

> (b)     Jane, located in Singapore;[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) and

> (c)     Hai, located in Singapore.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

> _Jarta and Jane (i.e. the DC 1490 Plaintiffs)_

> (a)     Jane, located in Singapore; [\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

> (b)     Angie, located in Singapore; [\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

> (c)     Hai, located in Singapore; [\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

> (d)     Khuc Thi Hong Ly, a tour guide located in Singapore; [\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) and

> (e)     Wilson Zeng Weisheng, an employee of Jarta located in Singapore. [\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31)

> _Bich Ha (i.e. the Defendant in DC 1448 and DC 1490)_

> (f)     Bich Ha, located in Vietnam;[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

> (g)     Hai, located in Singapore;[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

> (h)     Nguyen Giang (“**Giang**”), Hai’s brother, located in Vietnam;[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

> (i)     Thi Thu Hien Tran (“**Hien**”), Angie’s friend, located in Singapore; [\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) and

> (j)     the “_Transviet Group managers_”, located in Vietnam. [\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

32     I make two points on the parties’ list of proposed witnesses, before considering their connection to the present disputes.

> (a)     First is as to their relevance. Given the background of the matter, the relevance of the evidence of Angie, Jane, Bich Ha and Hai ought to be obvious. They would, in my view, be material witnesses in these proceedings. The other witnesses, however, require some introduction.

>> (i)       Khuc Thi Hong Ly is a tour guide and Wilson Zeng Weisheng is an employee of Jarta.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) Jane explained that these two witnesses will give evidence on how the Facebook Posts have impacted the reputation and image of Jarta and Jane in Singapore.[^38] Presumably, their evidence may also be relevant to Angie’s claim in DC 1448 as she too would need to establish publication and loss within Singapore.

>> (ii)       Giang is Hai’s brother.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) The “_Transviet Group managers_” are not identified by name, but refers to certain employee(s) of the Transviet group of companies who were in attendance at a meeting in Vietnam on 10 March 2021 with Bich Ha, Hai and Giang (“**10 March Meeting**”).[^40] At this 10 March Meeting, Bich Ha allegedly announced to the attendees that she would be “_taking back the shares in_ \[Transviet\]” from Hai because “_Hai had sex with a representative from_ \[Transviet’s\] _business partner_” and that the said representative “_wanted to use sex as a means to get a share of_ \[Transviet’s\] _air-cargo business_”.[^41] The Defendant explained that the purpose of calling Giang and the “_Transviet Group managers_” to give evidence on the 10 March Meeting is to show that Hai did not deny these accusations during that meeting.[^42]

>> (iii)       Hien is a friend to Angie.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) According to Bich Ha, Hien had confirmed to Bich Ha that Angie had told her (i.e. Hien) that Angie had “_caught Hai_” with the intention of getting involved in the Transviet’s air-cargo business.[^44] Bich Ha therefore intends to call Hien as a witness to establish her defence in justification.[^45]

> (b)     The second point relates to Hai’s location or place of residence. There is some dispute between the parties on this. Bich Ha asserts that Hai is “_residing in Vietnam_”.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) The Plaintiffs’ position is that although Hai previously resided in Vietnam, he now resides in Singapore.[^47] By the time the applications are heard before me, Hai had filed an affidavit to state that he currently lives in Singapore with Angie, that their marriage was solemnised in Singapore in February 2022 and that Hai has obtained an in-principle approval from the Immigration Authority of Singapore for a dependency pass pending the outcome of his formal application.[^48] Given Hai’s evidence, for the present purpose, I consider Hai as a witness who is located in Singapore.

33     The location of the witnesses and their compellability are different issues which should be considered separately.

34     Insofar as location is concerned, it is obvious based on the information currently available that most of the more material witnesses are located in Singapore. There would therefore clearly be savings of time and resources if the trial is held in Singapore. To the extent that some of the Defendant’s witnesses reside in Vietnam (i.e. Giang and the “_Transviet Group managers_”), Vietnam is relatively close to Singapore and travel between these two countries is easy and inexpensive. Further, there is the possibility of obtaining evidence from the witnesses located in Vietnam through video-link. The witness convenience factor therefore points towards Singapore. However, this is not a _significant_ factor because the Singapore witnesses can likewise easily travel to Vietnam.

35     Compellability of the parties’ witnesses, however, is generally regarded as a more significant factor since a Singapore court cannot compel a foreign witness to testify, whether physically or _via_ video-link: see O 38 r 18(2) of ROC. Therefore, the compellability of a foreign witness is a factor that generally points towards the jurisdiction in which that witness ordinarily resides: _JIO Minerals_ at \[71\]. This consideration is particularly relevant for third-party witnesses over whom the litigants have little control, and would therefore have to depend on the voluntary cooperation of these witnesses to give evidence in whichever jurisdiction the trial takes place.

36     In this case, Bich Ha submitted that both Giang and the “_Transviet Group managers_” are third-party witnesses who cannot be compelled to give evidence in Singapore.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

37     I accept that Giang is a third-party witness over whom Bich Ha has little control or influence. As for the “_Transviet Group managers_”, however, I consider that Bich Ha is likely to have _some_ control or influence in procuring their cooperation to give evidence for her in legal proceedings. The fact of the matter is that Bich Ha is the majority shareholder of Transviet and even on her own case, she appears to be in a position to make important decisions for Transviet. For example, Bich Ha convened the 10 March Meeting with the “_Transviet Group managers_” and, at that meeting, instructed the “_Transviet Group managers that they were not to act on Hai’s instructions to deal with any parties in relation to Transviet Group’s air-cargo business_”.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) As a further example, in Bich Ha’s correspondence with the Plaintiffs’ lawyers in June 2021, Bich Ha appointed a lawyer on behalf of “_TransViet_” in respect of the Plaintiffs’ claims.

38     Of course, I appreciate that the “_Transviet Group managers_” are (presumably) employees of entities within the Transviet group, and not employees of Bich Ha personally. However, the issue does not concern the _precise_ nature of parties’ employment relationship or, for that matter, “_control_” in the sense of having any legal power to compel. The question is to what extent the non-compellability of these foreign witnesses should feature in the appropriate forum analysis, and for this purpose I consider it more relevant to focus on how much _practical_ influence and control the litigants are likely to have over their witnesses, rather than theoretical control in any strict legal sense. In this regard, I note with some interest that the Defendant’s own position is that Hai is _not_ a third-party witness because he is Angie’s husband,[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) even though a husband has no legal obligation to do the wife’s bidding.

39     In any event, I am of the view that the evidence of Giang and the “_Transviet Group managers_” are peripheral to the main issues in DC 1448 and DC 1490.

40     As a start, it is not disputed that the Facebook Posts were authored by Bich Ha. Their alleged publication in Singapore, how they should be interpreted or perceived (including whether there was sufficient reference to the Plaintiffs), and their impact (if any) on the Plaintiffs’ reputation in Singapore are not matters which Giang or the “_Transviet Group managers_” can give any evidence on.

41     Instead, Bich Ha wishes to call Giang and the “_Transviet Group managers_” to show that during the 10 March Meeting, Hai failed to deny the allegation made by the Defendant that he “_had sex with a representative from \[Transviet’s\] business partner_” and that the said representative “_wanted to use sex as a means to get a share of \[Transviet’s\] air-cargo business_”.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) As Bich Ha’s counsel explained, this lack of denial from Hai allegedly gave rise to an inference that Bich Ha’s accusations are true, and this is a matter relevant to Bich Ha’s defence in justification.

42     It is of course Bich Ha’s prerogative as to the evidence she wishes to put forward to prove her defence. However, insofar as the intended evidence go towards what transpired at the 10 March Meeting, the following may be observed:

> (a)     First, apart from Giang and the “_Transviet Group managers_”, the 10 March Meeting was also attended by Bich Ha and Hai, both of whom can give evidence on what happened at that meeting. In fact, Hai would be in the best position to give evidence (and be subjected to cross examination) as to whether he did or did not deny the accusations made at the 10 March Meeting, and if he did not deny the allegations, the reason(s) for his silence.

> (b)     Second, whether Angie had sexual relations with Hai in order to procure a share of Transviet’s air-cargo business for Jarta is a matter that is best proven by the evidence of Angie, Hai and the business records of Jarta and Transviet. Whether Hai did or did not deny the accusations at the 10 March Meeting can only be said to be peripheral, if at all relevant, to the issue.

43     I am conscious that at this stage, the court should not predetermine the witnesses that the parties should call and the defendant need only show that the evidence from the foreign witnesses are arguably relevant to the defence. There is no need for the defendant to demonstrate exactly how the foreign witnesses’ testimony will be used: see _JIO Minerals_ at \[66\] and \[67\]. However, where the relevance of the foreign witnesses’ evidence is not obvious or apparent, and the defendant has chosen to explain how their testimony will be used, I do not see why I should not consider the extent of their relevance or materiality based on the defendant’s own account.

44     Considering all of the above, I am of the view that the availability and compellability witnesses is a factor which is finely balanced, but points _slightly_ towards Singapore as the more convenient forum, as most of the _material_ witnesses are located in Singapore where they are compellable.

#### Documents

45     I next consider the documentary evidence that would likely be relevant to the Plaintiffs’ claims.

46     The main documentary evidence is the Facebook Posts, which are in the Vietnamese language. Apart from that, the business records of Jarta may also be relevant, particularly to the issue of whether Jarta received a share of Transviet’s air-cargo business, and the damages suffered by Jarta in Singapore (if any) as a result of the allegedly defamatory remarks. Given that Jarta is a Singapore company, these documents are likely to be in the English language and located in Singapore.

47     I accept the Defendant’s submission that the Facebook Posts are important documentary evidence in this case, and that these documents being in the Vietnamese language is a factor that points to Vietnam being the more appropriate forum. However, I do not accept that the _quality_ of this factor is as strong as the Defendant contends.

48     I agree that if the trial is held in Singapore, the Facebook Posts would have to be translated. That would mean additional time and costs. As a matter of _convenience_, therefore, I agree that it would be _easier_ if the disputes were litigated in Vietnam. However, I do not consider that this factor goes much further than a matter of convenience. The Singapore courts are no stranger to adjudicating claims based on translations of documents authored in a foreign language. In fact, the ROC even makes provision for how a document in a foreign language can be used in legal proceedings in Singapore: see O 92 rrs 1 and 1A of ROC. In this case, Vietnamese is by no measure a peculiar or obscure language for which reliable and accurate translation is difficult to procure. The Defendant does not suggest that professional translations cannot be procured. In fact, the Plaintiffs have already procured certified translations of the Facebook Posts, and these translations are annexed to the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim in DC 1448 and DC 1490. The Defendant, while reserving her position on the accuracy of these translations, has not suggested that any part of the translation is inaccurate, or that the nuance in the language is such that it would be difficult to procure _any_ translation that can accurately or sufficiently convey the meanings of the words in their native language.

49     Accordingly, I am of the view that the location and language of the documentary evidence in this case points towards Vietnam being the more appropriate forum, but it is not a strong connecting factor.

#### Place where the tort occurred

50     As a general rule, the place in which a tort had occurred is _prima facie_ the natural forum for determining the claim: see _Rickshaw Investments_ _Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 377</span> at \[37\] to \[40\]; _JIO Minerals_ at \[106\]. 

51     But where did the tort (if any) occur in this case?

52     Bich Ha was in Vietnam when she posted the Facebook Posts on her Facebook account. However, given that the Facebook Posts are posted online, Bich Ha’s physical locale at the time of posting is fortuitous. She could well have been in an airport lounge in Amsterdam, and it would have made no difference to the meaning and reach of the Facebook Posts.

53     In my view, where defamation is concerned, and particularly where the alleged defamatory remarks are posted online, the place where the tort occurred and the jurisdiction which has a _prima facie_ closer connection to the dispute is the place where publication and damage is said to have taken place. This is because the core objective of the tort of defamation is the _protection of a person’s reputation_, and harm to one’s reputation is done – not when the defamatory words are composed or written – but when they are “_published_” in the sense that they are _comprehended_ by an audience other than the claimant. The place where this took place should therefore be the _prima facie_ appropriate forum for the resolution of the dispute.

54     The following extract from the decision of the High Court of Australia in _Dow Jones & Company Inc v Gutnick_ (2002) 210 CLR 575, which has been cited with approval in _Qingdao Bohai Construction Group Co, Ltd and others v Goh Teck Beng and another_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 977</span> at \[39\] and _Lee Hsien Loong v Review Publishing Co Ltd and another and another suit_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 453</span> (“**_Review Publishing_**”) at \[37\], is instructive, relevant and worth reproducing in some length (at \[25\] - \[27\] and \[44\]):

> **The tort of defamation, at last as understood in Australia, focuses upon publications causing damage to reputation**. It is a tort of strict liability, in the sense that a defendant may be liable even though no injury to reputation was intended and the defendant acted with reasonable care. … But **it is a tort concerned with damage to reputation and it is that damage which founds the cause of action**. Perhaps, as Pollock said in 1887, the law went “wrong from the beginning in making the damage and not the insult the cause of action” for slander but it is now too late to deny that damage by publication is the focus of the law.

> **Harm to reputation is done when a defamatory publication is comprehended by the reader, the listener, or the observer.** Until then, no harm is done by it. This being so it would be wrong to treat publication as if it were a unilateral act on the part of the publisher alone. It is not. **It is a bilateral act - in which the publisher makes it available and a third party has it available for his or her comprehension.**

> …

> In defamation, the same considerations that require rejection of locating the tort by reference only to the publisher’s conduct, lead to the conclusion that, **ordinarily, defamation is to be located at the place where the damage to reputation occurs**. **Ordinarily that will be where the material which is alleged to be defamatory is available in comprehensible form** assuming, of course, that the person defamed has in that place a reputation which is thereby damaged. **It is only when the material is in comprehensible form that the damage to reputation is done and it is damage to reputation which is the principal focus of defamation, not any quality of the defendant’s conduct**. In the case of material on the World Wide Web, it is not available in comprehensible form until downloaded on to the computer of a person who has used a web browser to pull the material from the web server. **It is where that person downloads the material that the damage to reputation may be done. Ordinarily then, that will be the place where the tort of defamation is committed. **

\[emphasis added in bold\]

55     In this case, the Plaintiffs’ case is that the Facebook Posts are targeted at damaging the Plaintiffs’ reputation amongst the Vietnamese community in Singapore, that these posts have been viewed by people in Singapore and that the Plaintiffs’ claim for losses and damages are limited to those suffered in Singapore.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) It is therefore the Plaintiffs’ _reputation in Singapore_ which they are seeking to protect in DC 1448 and DC 1490.

56     In my view, this _strongly_ suggests that the place where the tort (if any) occurred is Singapore and that Singapore is, _prima facie_, the natural forum for determining the claim. This is a strong connecting factor not only because it goes to the heart of what the tort of defamation seeks to protect, but also because it means that evidence (whether witnesses or documents) relating to crucial issues such as publication and damage would most likely be found and located in Singapore.

57     Accordingly, I am of the view that the place where the tort (if any) occurred is Singapore and this is a strong connecting factor pointing to Singapore as the proper forum for the disputes.

#### The applicable law

58     The Defendant’s counsel submitted the applicable law is a neutral factor in this case because both the laws of Singapore and that of Vietnam apply pursuant to the double-actionability rule. The Plaintiffs’ counsel made no submission on this issue.

59     For the reasons set out at \[52\] to \[57\] above, I hesitate to accept that the double actionability rule (which provides that an action for an alleged tort committed in a foreign jurisdiction must be actionable under both the law of the forum and the law where the wrong was committed) applies in this case as I consider that the place where the tort (if any) occurred is Singapore and not Vietnam. In any event, even if the double actionability rule applied, there is nothing before me to suggest that a Vietnam court would have any difficulty applying Singapore law, or _vice versa_.

60     In the absence of full submissions on this issue, I consider that the applicable law is a neutral factor in this case.

####    Conclusion on the Forum Issue

61     My finding on each of the connecting factors considered are summaried below:

62     Considering all of the foregoing, I am of the view under stage one of the _Spiliada_ test, Singapore is the proper forum for the Plaintiffs’ claims in DC 1448 and DC 1490. The fact that the alleged publication and damage occurred in Singapore is a strong connecting factor as this goes to the heart of the Plaintiffs’ claims in defamation. Singapore is the jurisdiction where the alleged publication and damage to the Plaintiffs’ reputation (if any) occurred. Although the Facebook Posts are written in Vietnamese, I have no reason to think that their contents cannot be properly or adequately understood through procuring certified translations pursuant to O 92 r 1 of the ROC. Lastly, although some of the Defendant’s witnesses are located in Vietnam, their evidence appears to be peripheral to the main issues in these proceedings. In any event, there are other witnesses within jurisdiction who can give evidence on the same factual issue. In this regard, it must be remembered that the Plaintiffs need only show that Singapore is the _more_ appropriate forum than Vietnam, regardless whether it is so “_by a hair or by a mile_”: see _Siemens_ at \[8\].

63     Since Singapore is the _forum conveniens_ and the Defendant’s counsel confirmed during the hearing before me that the Defendant is not disputing that:

> (a)     the Plaintiffs’ claims come within one of the heads of claim in Order 11 rule 1 of the ROC; and

> (b)     there is a sufficient degree of merit to the Plaintiffs’ claims for the purposes of the Service Out Orders,

there is no basis to set aside the Service Out Orders. The Defendant’s applications to set aside the Service Out Orders made in DC 1448 and DC 1490 are therefore dismissed.

### The Sub Service Issue

64     Having concluded that Singapore is the proper forum, I have to consider whether the Sub Service Orders should be set aside, either because of certain procedural irregularities, or because the Plaintiffs failed to make full and frank disclosure at the time they applied for these orders.

#### Whether the Sub Service Orders should be set aside for procedural irregularities

65     The dispute between the parties is whether the Plaintiffs had taken sufficient (and unsuccessful) effort to effect personal service on the Defendant, such that it can be said to be “_impracticable…to serve_ \[the writs\] _personally_” on the Defendant at the material time. On this issue, the positions in DC 1448 and DC 1490 are slightly different.

66     In DC 1448 (i.e. Angie’s claim), the application for the Sub Service Order was filed in early September 2021. Angie’s evidence at the material time of the application was as follows:

> (a)     Angie was unaware of the Defendant’s residential address in Vietnam.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54)

> (b)     Angie’s Singapore lawyer consulted with a Vietnamese lawyer on whether searches can be conducted in Vietnam to ascertain Bich Ha’s residential address, and was advised by the said Vietnamese lawyer that although it was possible perform a search at the National Business Registration Portal of Vietnam (“**NBRP**”), it was uncertain “_if the search could reveal_ \[Bich Ha’s\] _residential address_” because Angie did not know the precise “_role or position_” of Bich Ha in companies under Transviet.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)

> (c)     As such, Angie had wanted to attempt personal service at the Bich Ha’s work address in Ho Chi Minh City.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56)

> (d)     However, Angie was unable to do so as the “_Vietnamese Government recently introduced strict lockdown measures throughout Vietnam restricting movement_”.[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) Angie was advised by the same Vietnamese lawyer that Ho Chi Minh City has “_strictly applied social distancing measures under the support of the Vietnamese army_” and that under the lockdown, “_most citizens of the city must stay at home and are prohibited from going outside unless for emergency situations_”. As a result, the Vietnamese lawyer indicated that “_courier service was either suspended in some areas in the city or delayed a lot. In practice_, \[the documents of the Vietnamese lawyer\] _being sent from Hanoi to_ \[Ho Chi Minh City\] _in this month were returned by couriers_”.[^58]

67     In DC 1490 (i.e. Jane and Jarta’s claim), the application for the Sub Service Order was filed in early October 2021. Jane’s evidence at the material time of the application was as follows:

> (a)     Like Angie, Jane was unaware of Bich Ha’s residential address in Vietnam.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59)

> (b)     Jane (through her Singapore lawyers) had consulted with a Vietnamese lawyer on whether it was possible to obtain the Defendant’s address in Vietnam through public searches. However, the Vietnamese lawyer advised that “_\[b\]ecause the role or position of the Defendant in_ \[Trans Viet Travel Co. Ltd.\] _has not been verified_, \[he is\] _not sure if the search_ \[at the NBRP\] _could reveal_ \[the Defendant’s\] _residential address_”.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60)

> (c)     Further, Jane also indicated that it was impracticable for her to attempt to serve the documents at the Defendant’s work address because of the “_heavy restrictions in Vietnam, especially in Ho Chi Minh_”.[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61)

68     The Defendant says that the Plaintiffs have not done enough. Specifically, the Defendant says that the Plaintiffs should have:

> (a)     attempted to obtain the Defendant’s residential address from Hai, since Hai had known the Defendant for a long time;[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62)

> (b)     conducted searches on the NBRP to see if they returned any results;[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63) and

> (c)     attempted to effect personal service at the Defendant’s work address, since courier services, though delayed, was “_still allowed to operate_” between July and September 2021. Further, the Defendant’s case is that after 1 October 2021, all restrictions to postal services were removed and couriers were able to operate at full capacity.[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64)

69     Having reviewed the documents carefully, I am of the view that the Sub Service Orders should not be set aside on the basis that the Plaintiffs failed to take reasonable efforts to effect personal service.

70     I agree with the Defendant that there were “_more_” which the Plaintiffs could have done. For example, I agree that the Plaintiffs could and should have instructed their Vietnamese lawyer to conduct a search on the NBRP to see if it was possible to ascertain the Defendant’s residential address from the database. Afterall, even if the Plaintiffs did not know the precise role of the Defendant in the Transviet companies, there are only a limited number of ways in which the Defendant could have been involved (i.e. as a representative, owner and/or director) and it was not suggested that the costs of performing these searches were prohibitive. I also agree that, at least in the case of Angie, attempts should have been made to verify if Hai knew the Defendant’s residential address in Vietnam. In my view, this would have been an obvious, simple and entirely reasonable step for Angie to have taken, given the close relationship between Hai and the Defendant which was known to Angie.

71     Of course, there is no evidence before me to show that these searches and checks – even if undertaken – would have revealed the Defendant’s residential address in Vietnam. Indeed, the Defendant has to-date avoided stating or confirming her residential address despite the filing of numerous affidavits in these applications. However, the issue is not about whether the efforts taken would be _fruitful_, but whether they were _reasonable_ in the circumstances: _Lim Quee Choo (suing as co-administratrix of the estate of Koh Jit Meng) and Another v David Rasif and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 36</span> at \[37\]. The Plaintiffs are certainly not expected to exhaust all ways and means to attempt personal service, but they must at least use _sufficient effort_ to do so. In this case, I am of the view that the effort taken by the Plaintiffs to ascertain the Defendant’s residential address was lacklustre and wanting.

72     Having said that, I do not think that based on the evidence in this case, the Plaintiffs’ omissions were so serious, prejudicial or deliberate such that the Sub Service Orders should be set aside for procedural irregularities. In other words, I consider that this is an appropriate case for me to exercise my discretion to cure such procedural irregularities. Guiding the exercise of my discretion are the factors outlined in _Humpuss_ (see \[21(c)\] above).

73     In my view, the Plaintiffs did make good faith attempts to comply with the ROC based on the information available to them at the material time. While I think that they did an unsatisfactory job at that, this was not a case where no effort was made at all. Further, the circumstances do not suggest that the Plaintiff had intentionally avoided attempting personal service with a view to cause any harm or prejudice to the Defendant (for example, to steal a march on the Defendant in these proceedings). There were strong suggestions at the material time that the alternative methods of service sought in the applications for substituted service would have been very effective at bringing the proceedings to the notice of the Defendant, as the Defendant had been very responsive in her email exchanges with the Plaintiffs’ lawyers up to that stage. In those circumstances, I find it more likely that the Plaintiffs were misguided by a sense that it would simply have been easier, more convenient and more effective for service of process to be effected by these alternative means instead. Of course, convenience is not the test in an application for substituted service. However, this is in my view relevant in assessing the blameworthiness of the Plaintiffs for the non-compliance. For completeness, I note that there is also no suggestion that the Defendant would be prejudiced if the Sub Service Orders were not set aside.

74     Accordingly, I decline to set aside the Sub Service Orders on the basis that the Plaintiffs failed to employ sufficient effort to locate the Defendant for the purposes of personal service.

#### Whether the Plaintiffs failed to make full and frank disclosure

75     The Defendant’s last objection is that the Sub Service Orders should be set aside because the Plaintiffs failed to make full and frank disclosure at the time they applied for the Sub Service Orders. Specifically, the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiffs breached their duties to make full and frank disclosure by:

> (a)     mischaracterising the advice from their Vietnamese lawyer and misleading the court into thinking that the Plaintiffs had conducted a search on the NBRP when this was not done;[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65)

> (b)     Failing to disclose that lockdown measures in Ho Chi Minh city were lifted as of 1 October 2021.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66)

##### (1)   Mischaracterisation of advice

76     On the first point, I do not agree that the Plaintiffs had misled the court as to whether a search on the NBRP had been conducted:

> (a)     In DC 1490, Jane’s affidavit clearly stated that she was “_unable to conduct a search to reveal the Defendant’s residential address from_ \[the NBRP\]” because she did not know the “_position and/or title_” of the Defendant in the Transviet Group companies.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67) The email advice from Jane’s Vietnamese lawyer stating the same was quoted _verbatim_ in the body of Jane’s affidavit. Accordingly, I cannot agree that that was any failure to give full and frank disclosure.

> (b)     In DC 1448, the issue of mischaracterisation arose from an affidavit filed by Angie’s solicitor in support of the application for substituted service. In this affidavit, Angie’s solicitor stated “\[the Vietnamese lawyer\] _had attempted to locate the Defendant’s place of residence through conducting a search on the_ \[NBRP\]_…. However, the Defendant’s place of residence could not be found because the Defendant’s role or position in the company has not been verified_” (the “**Statement**”).[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) I agree that the way the Statement has been worded is unfortunate. However, the ambiguity in the Statement lends it to a number of interpretations and Angie’s lawyer quickly followed up (in the same affidavit) by referring to an email exchange with the Vietnamese lawyer “_explaining the_ \[Statement\]” (“**Email Exchange**”).[^69] It was apparent from the Email Exchange that Angie’s lawyer merely enquired whether it was possible to conduct searches on “_the Vietnamese equivalent of ACRA searches_”, and the Vietnamese lawyer responded that while this was possible, he was “_not sure if the search could reveal_ \[the Defendant’s\] _residential address_”.[^70] It was clear from the Email Exchange that the Vietnamese lawyer did not in fact conduct a search on the NBRP, and there was no follow-up instruction from Angie’s Singapore lawyer for him to do so.

77     On the point in \[76(b)\] above, I should add that while I accept that the material facts should generally be disclosed in the body of the affidavit itself, in this case the issue is not one of non-disclosure, but rather alleged mischaracterisation. In these circumstances, I see no reason why the Statement cannot be read together with the Email Exchange for full context, especially in a short affidavit running no more than 14 pages (including exhibits).

##### (2)   Failure to disclose lifting of lock-down measures

78     On the second point, I do not agree that the Sub Service Orders should be set aside because the Plaintiff did not disclose to the court that the lock-down measures in Ho Chi Minh city had been lifted on 1 October 2021.

79     On this issue, the situations in DC 1448 and DC 1490 are somewhat similar (save for some differences highlighted at \[83\] and \[88\] below). In both cases, the Sub Service Orders were granted on 13 October 2021 by the same Deputy Registrar and in both applications, the Plaintiffs took the position that it was impracticable to effect personal service on the Defendant in Ho Chi Minh city due to (amongst others) the lock-down measures implemented there. There was no mention of these measures having been lifted or relaxed on 1 October 2021.

80     There is some dispute between the parties as to whether the lock-down measures in Ho Chi Minh city were in fact lifted on 1 October 2021. The Defendant procured an affidavit from a Vietnamese lawyer who opined that “_as of 1 October 2021, the Covid-19 lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City was brought to an end, followed by the re-opening of a wide range of public activities…_”.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) Certified translation of a directive issued by the People’s Committee of Ho Chi Minh City dated 30 September 2021 was also provided to substantiate this point.[^72]

81     The Plaintiffs did not address this issue substantively. Instead, the Plaintiffs made a curious assertion that “_where there are 2 differing expert opinion, the Court does not need to make a choice of which opinion to be inclined towards. What is pertinent is that this Honourable Court has already accepted the expert opinion of_ \[the Plaintiffs’ Vietnamese lawyer\]…”.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) According to the submissions from the Plaintiffs’ lawyer, the issue “_should be left to trial_”.[^74] No authority was cited and this submission made no sense. Clearly, to determine whether there was non-disclosure of material facts on an _ex parte_ application, the court must determine whether the alleged non-disclosure is of a “_fact_” at all. I therefore reject the Plaintiffs’ incredible submission on this point.

82     I find that on the evidence before me, the lock-down measures in Ho Chi Minh city were in fact lifted on 1 October 2021. The issue therefore is whether non-disclosure of this fact is material and rendered the Sub Service Orders liable to be set aside.

83     After the hearing and upon my further directions, the Plaintiffs were given leave to file further supplementary affidavits, limited to addressing this issue. The Defendant was also given an opportunity to respond if she considered it necessary. In the further affidavits filed by the Plaintiffs, the following explanations were provided:

> (a)     In DC 1490, Jane explained that at the time she made the application for substituted service on 6 October 2021, she had relied on the advice of her Vietnamese lawyer on the situation in Ho Chi Minh city.[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75) The advice was initially given in early September 2021 but further confirmed on 20 September 2021.[^76] As Jane received no update from her Vietnamese lawyer of any material change to the situation, she had proceeded on the basis that the advice was correct.[^77]

> (b)     In DC 1448, Angie took a substantially similar position, in that she too had relied on the advice from her Vietnamese lawyer on the lock-down situation in Ho Chi Minh city, and as she did not receive any update from the Vietnamese lawyer, she had assumed that the last advice she received on 20 September 2021 was correct.[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78)

84     The Defendant’s counsel urged me not to place any weight on these explanations as they are mere afterthoughts. The Defendant’s counsel submitted that the Plaintiffs had deliberately avoided stating on affidavit that they were “_unaware_” of the lifting of the lock-down measures in Ho Chi Minh city on 1 October 2021, and such deliberate avoidance showed that they were in fact aware and intentionally suppressed this fact when making the applications for the Sub Service Orders.

85     I am unable to accept these submissions. As the Plaintiffs explained, they have been residing in Singapore since around 2006 / 2007 and do not have first-hand information on the situation in Vietnam at the material time.[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79) It is clear from the affidavits filed by the Plaintiffs that they had simply left it to their Singapore and Vietnamese lawyers to advise on the situation in Ho Chi Minh city, and the practicability of attempting personal service on the Defendant under the then-prevailing circumstances. While I agree that these explanations from the Plaintiffs could and should have been given earlier, I do not consider that the delay in putting them forward is, on its own, sufficient basis for me to infer that the explanations given on affidavit are untrue. Afterall, more than 15 affidavits have been filed and/or relied upon in these two applications with numerous allegations canvassed. In the absence of other and better evidence that the Plaintiffs in fact knew that the lock-down measures in Ho Chi Minh city was lifted on 1 October 2021, I decline to find that they had intentionally suppressed this fact when applying for the Sub Service Orders.

86     Of course, the duty to make full and frank disclosure on an _ex parte_ application is not limited to facts which the applicant actually knows. It include facts which he or she _would have known_ if the proper inquiries were made. The extent of the inquiries which an applicant should make would have to depend on the facts and circumstances prevailing in the case: see _Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 786</span> at \[21\]; _Vasiliy Golovnin_ at \[88\].

87     In this case, I consider that the Plaintiffs had made reasonably inquiries on the lock-down situation in Ho Chi Minh city _at the time of the filing of their respective application_. In my view, it was not unreasonable to have relied on professional advice which the applicants received two weeks prior.

88     This is particularly so in the case of Angie’s application in DC 1448 which was made as early as 8 September 2021 (even though the order was only granted in October 2021 after three hearings). At that time, the lock-down measures in Ho Chi Minh city had not yet been lifted, so there can be no issue of material non-disclosure. The question really is whether Angie should have procured and provided a further update before the order was eventually granted on 13 October 2021.

89     On an application such as this, I cannot see good reason to impose such obligation on the applicant, unless the applicant knew or had reasonable basis to believe that there was a material change in the circumstances previously deposed to. Afterall, in an application for substituted service, the relevant question is whether personal service was impracticable _as at the date on which the application was made_: see _Foxe v Brown_ <span class="citation">\[1984\] HCA 69</span> at \[16\]; _Callan v Chawk_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] FCA 1182</span> at \[9\]. It is therefore an open question (on which I express no view in the absence of full submissions) whether changes in circumstances which occurred _after_ the application for substituted service was made would have been a relevant and material fact at all. The position may well be different on an application for an Anton Pillar order or a Mareva injunction, where the consequences are much more drastic. There is, afterall, authority for taking a differentiated approach in considering the duty of full and frank disclosure amongst the spectrum of _ex parte_ applications: see _The “Lircay”_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 699</span> at \[24\]. For an _ex parte_ application for substituted service, I do not consider that the applicant’s duty to make full and frank disclosure extends that far.

90     Even if I was wrong on the above and the Plaintiffs had a continuing obligation to make inquiries and provide updates up to the point until the orders are granted, I consider this an appropriate situation for me to exercise my discretion not to set aside the Sub Service Orders. In this regard, the principle of proportionality in assessing the sin of omission against the impact of default should be applied: see _Vasiliy Golovnin_ at \[84\]. In the context of this case, I do not consider that omission on the part of the Plaintiffs in obtaining an updated advice from their Vietnamese lawyers on the lock-down situation in Ho Chi Minh city was so serious, blatant or prejudicial as to justify setting aside the Sub Service Orders.

91     I am therefore satisfied that the Plaintiffs have discharged their duties to make full and frank disclosure of material facts in making the applications for the Sub Service Orders. This is not a ground on which to set aside the Sub Service Orders.

## Conclusion

92     For the reasons given above, both Sum 4631 and Sum 4632 are dismissed.

93     Although I have declined to set aside the Service Out Orders and the Sub Service Orders, I should point out I have not been impressed with the way in which the Plaintiffs had sought the Service Out Orders and the Sub Service Orders. At nearly every step of the way, the court had to seek further clarifications and/or procure essential undertakings from the Plaintiffs, before the orders were granted. For example, the Plaintiffs had initially failed to limit their claims to losses suffered in Singapore, despite this being a well-established requirement in an application for leave to serve out of jurisdiction for defamation claims: see _Review Publishing_ at \[30\]. It was only when the court brought this requirement to the Plaintiffs’ attention did the Plaintiffs provide the necessary undertakings to rectify the issue. Likewise, the court had to seek various clarifications in respect of Angie’s application for substituted service in DC 1448, and the order was only granted after three hearings. This should not have been the case. Parties, particularly when they are legally advised, are expected to apprise themselves of the legal requirements for any application they wish to make, even if (and perhaps more so) the application is an _ex parte_ one. If they fail to do so, then it will be at their own peril.

94     Parties are directed to:

> (a)     file and exchange written submissions on costs for Sum 4631 and Sum 4632, limited to no more than 5 pages, within two weeks from the date of this decision; and

> (b)     write in within three weeks from the date of this decision to confirm (i) if parties consent to costs being determined by way of a documents-only hearing based on the written submissions tendered pursuant to the direction given at \[94(a)\] above; or (ii) if any of the parties require a further oral hearing on costs.

95     In the absence of a further oral hearing, costs of Sum 4631 and Sum 4632 will be determined based on parties’ written submissions at a documents-only hearing to be convened.

96     Lastly, I wish to record my appreciation to both counsels for their detailed written and oral submissions in these applications.
