### District Judge Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz:

## Introduction

1       In the early hours of 8 January 2019, Lee Yan Ru (“the Accused”) rubbed his exposed penis across the Complainant’s breasts as he knelt atop her (“the act”) in a study room located in the School of Economics and Social Science Building (“the Building”) at the Singapore Management University (“the University”). The Accused persisted with the act in spite of the Complainant asking him to stop, ceasing only after he had ejaculated on her.

2       A charge under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) was framed against him for this act. He contested the charge and at the close of the trial, having heard the evidence and considered the submissions of the parties, I convicted the Accused and sentenced him to 10 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

3       The Accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He remains on bail pending the hearing of the appeal. I now provide an outline of the evidence led at trial and detail the grounds of my decision.

## The Undisputed Facts

4       Pursuant to section 267(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), an Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF” / Exhibit P1) was tendered in evidence by consent of the parties. The following salient facts may be gleaned from the ASOF:

> a.     upon forensic analysis, the Accused’s semen was found on a swab taken from the Complainant’s right neck and face. His semen was also found on discarded tissue paper which he had used to wipe the Complainant’s right neck, face and hair;[^1]

> b.     the Accused’s statement to the police (Exhibit P9) was recorded on 8 January 2019 at 3.28 p.m., accurately and voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise, by Station Inspector Koh Bao Bao;[^2] and

> c.     several of the parties’ movements within and in the vicinity of the Building on 8 January 2019, were captured on closed-circuit television (“CCTV”). The timestamp on the footage (Exhibit P2) is accurate.[^3] There was no CCTV camera in the study room occupied by the Accused and the Complainant.[^4]

## The Prosecution’s Case

### The Complainant’s Evidence

5       The Complainant was the main witness for the Prosecution. The following is a summary of her evidence.

#### The point when the parties become acquainted on Instagram

6       The Complainant, then 20 years old, became acquainted with the Accused over Instagram, a social media platform. A log of their Instagram messages was extracted from the Complainant’s mobile phone and adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P13. It shows that on the morning of 1 January 2019, the Accused initiated contact when he messaged the Complainant in response to an Instagram story she had posted. That afternoon, the Accused sent the Complainant a second message after she posted a photograph of herself. The Complainant responded and the duo exchanged several messages. In the course of these messages, the Accused told the Complainant she was pretty.[^5] She took this as a compliment but not an expression of interest.[^6]

7       In a series of messages on 2 January 2019, the Accused offered to buy the Complainant a pair of sunglasses and lunch. Given their limited interaction at this stage, the Complainant declined both offers.[^7] She also informed the Accused that she had a boyfriend, hoping that he would take the hint and not make further advances.[^8] Between 2 and 4 January 2019, the duo chatted mostly about their respective schools and schoolwork. [^9] The Complainant continued communicating with the Accused as she saw no harm in making friends. She also did not want to be rude and brush him off since they had mutual friends.[^10]

8       The parties eventually switched to communicating on Telegram, a messaging platform. A log of their Telegram messages was extracted from the Complainant’s mobile phone and adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P14. These exchanges generally centered on conversations about their mutual friends, interests and school commitments.

#### The first meeting at Kith Café on 7 January 2019

9       At the Accused’s suggestion, the parties met at Kith Café near the University on the morning of 7 January 2019. Their first meeting was prompted by the Complainant asking the Accused for recommendations on places to study.[^11] At Kith Café, the Complainant purchased a drink and sat down to work on a school assignment. The Accused sat beside her which the Complainant thought was weird as it would have been easier to have a conversation seated across from each other. However, she refrained from saying anything as she did not think much of it.[^12]

10     In the midst of doing her work, the Accused poked the Complainant’s ribs. She moved his hand away as she felt awkward but did not say anything as she did not want him to feel bad. As they had mutual friends, the Complainant explained that she felt unable to excuse herself from the Accused’s company as she did not want to be rude or leave a bad impression. Further, as she perceived the Accused to have been physical with her in a friendly way, she was wary of blowing things out of proportion and decided to keep things casual by brushing-off his actions.[^13] The Complainant testified that there was no further physical contact between them, and the Accused left after several minutes as he had to return to school whilst she continued with her work in the cafe.

#### The arrangement for a night study session

11     The parties continued communicating on Telegram after parting ways. That afternoon, when the Accused asked the Complainant if she wanted to study with him at night, she informed him that she was available that night or the following night.[^14] As the Complainant had a laboratory report due the following morning, she thought that studying with someone would prevent her from falling asleep and force her to complete the assignment.[^15]

12     Prior to meeting that night, the Complainant asked the Accused several questions about their impending study session. This exchange is reproduced below:[^16]

![]([2022] SGMC 0008_Image/[2022] SGMC 0008_image2.png)

#### The night study session on 8 January 2019

13     The following paragraphs canvass the Complainant’s evidence vis-à-vis her various interactions with the Accused in the course of the night, prior to the act. In a nutshell, the Complainant testified that she neither welcomed nor reciprocated the various advances the Accused had made towards her.

14     Pursuant to their arrangement, the Complainant arrived at the Building at about 1.00 a.m. on 8 January 2019. She was dressed in leggings, a tank top and a black jacket as she intended to go to the gym later that morning after submitting her report.[^17] The Complainant was shocked[^18] when the Accused led her to a study room on level 3,[^19] as she had assumed (after seeing an Instagram story posted by a mutual friend of the parties) that they would be studying in the library:

And did you know … which part of the school you’ll be … working in?

 |
| 

A

 | 

\[T\]he accused didn’t let me know but, uh, I assumed from the Instagram’s, uh, post, um, ‘sidetrack’, uh, because ‘Bryan’ posted Instagram story where they were in a --- it looked like a library setting. There were tables and books around. And the accused told me that, uh, that --- that particular place was the place that he would always go to almost every day. And his group of friends would go there early to chope the table. So … when he asked me to go to SMU to do work, I assumed that it will be that area.

 | 

Cross-Examination [^21]

| 

A

 | 

\[I\] assumed he would bring me to the library.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Why did you assume that?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Because in the course of our conversation, uh, he did take a video of the said, uh, library, yah. Like, uh, a sort of virtual tour, then like a short video clip of what it was like.

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

\[W\]as there any particular reason why you wanted to go to the library?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It looked like a conducive space to do work.

 |

  
  

15     In the study room, the Complainant and Accused sat at a table across from one another and started doing their work. A while later, the Accused placed the heel of his bare foot on the Complainant’s left thigh. As it was weird, awkward and unhygienic, she pushed his foot off and it fell to the floor. The Accused continued placing his foot on the Complainant’s left thigh and she kept pushing it away.[^22] This happened about 3 to 5 times over no more than 10 minutes.[^23] When asked why she did not say anything, the Complainant testified:[^24]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

And, again, if you don’t mind me asking, why didn’t you say anything?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I --- **I just felt really awkward** and I’m not **\--- I’m not really verbal when** I --- **I feel awkward**. **I also thought that by** --- me **pushing** his --- **his feet off**, you know, **he would understand that I do not want** his feet on my thigh --- **his foot on my thigh**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Can you explain what you mean when you say, “I’m not verbal when I feel awkward”?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, I guess what I’m trying to say is I’m not expressive with, uh, like, uh, with my bodily, uh, language rather than verbally. So **I tried to get**, uh, **my points across**, uh, **through actions.**

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

16     The Complainant also explained that she was not comfortable telling the Accused that she did not want his foot on her thigh, as she was a guest in the study room.[^25] However, as she was annoyed with his actions, she moved to the floor with her laptop. As she was nearly done with her work, she decided to take a break and watch a movie on Netflix before editing her report.

17     At some juncture before the movie began, the Complainant changed into a singlet as the air-conditioning in the room was not on and she was hot. She changed behind a wall in the walkway of the room, after ensuring that she was out of the Accused’s line of sight.[^26]

18     A few minutes after the Complainant had moved to the floor, the Accused asked if he could join her. She told him to do his work whilst she watched Netflix. The Complainant explained that her response was _“passive-aggressive”_ as she was not very comfortable with the Accused joining her and _“felt that there should be some space”_ between them. However, she did not protest when the Accused nonetheless lay on the floor beside her as she _“didn’t really think much about it \[and\] just thought “let’s just watch this movie together then””_.[^27] At this juncture, though there was some shoulder-to-shoulder contact which made her feel a little uncomfortable, it did not really affect her.[^28]

19     A while later, the Accused remarked that the bright fluorescent lights were hurting his eyes and suggested that they move under the table to continue watching the movie. As the Complainant’s eyes were hurting as well, she agreed. Explaining why she did not see anything untoward about moving under the table with the Accused, the Complainant testified:[^29]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

\[W\]hy did you agree to go under the table with Yan Ru where it would be an even more confined space?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**I didn’t see him lying next to me or his foot on my thigh as something that was threatening**, um, something that would put me in danger. It just made me uncomfortable and I just thought, I --- I’ll just brush it off. Yah. It wasn’t such a big deal, um, and we’re halfway into the movie, the lights were really hurting, so, we move under the table to continue.

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

20     The parties moved and lay under the table on their stomachs, with the Accused to the Complainant’s left. Towards the end of the movie, the Accused placed his right arm over the Complainant’s back and tickled her right armpit. When the Complainant used her hand to block him, he tickled her left armpit instead. Once again, the Complainant used her hand to block him. As the Complainant felt weird, she told the Accused to _“stop”_. He complied and they continued watching the movie.[^30]

21     In the Complainant’s estimation, the movie ended at about 4.00 a.m. When she closed her laptop, the Accused reached over and tickled her abdomen with his right hand. As it was ticklish, the Complainant squirmed until she lay on her back, all whilst trying to cover the parts of her body that he continued to tickle.[^31] The Complainant eventually sat-up in front of the Accused with her back to him.[^32] In this position, the Accused reached across the Complainant, inserted his hands under her top and sports bra and groped her breasts[^33] - his left hand groped her left breast and his right hand groped her right breast[^34]. This lasted for a few seconds until she managed to pry his fingers off with her nails and fingers.[^35] The Complainant testified that she struggled to remove the Accused’s fingers.[^36] When asked if she consented to the act, she explained that _“there was nothing to consent to because he did not ask”_.[^37] In the course of her evidence, she also explained why she did not _say_ anything to the Accused:

 | 

Evidence-in-Chief [^38]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Did you say anything to the accused’s act?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, because I --- **I was struggling**. To put things into perspective, after that I was **quite** sweaty, I was perspiring.

 |
| 

 | 

Cross-Examination [^39]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, according to you, you did not say anything to Yan Ru, but instead used your hands to pry off his fingers, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes. **I was focused on removing his hand from under my shirt and my sports bra.**

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, why did you not shout or scream at him?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, as mentioned before **I’m not a very verbal person**. I --- I don’t like to shout or scream, yah. And, uh, I --- **I thought that removing his hands from under my shirt would just be enough**, yah.

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

 | 

\[T\]his groping would be the first, um, the first time he crossed a line to me and **I thought that if I removed it and** … **he did stop** … **we will just move on** and we wouldn’t end the night on a bad note.

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, sensing this potential threat or danger for the first time and for the first time he has crossed this line, wouldn’t it be more instinctive for you to shout or scream at him?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I remain my stance, I do not shout or scream at people, yah, especially, um, not an acquaintance. I just think that it would be really unpleasant. I also **thought that by removing his hand**, um, **by logic and common sense he would understand not to continue.**

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

 | 

\[T\]hroughout the incident when I pried his finger off or, uh, crawled from under the table, I thought that was, um, sufficient enough to show that I --- that I didn’t like what he was doing and I disagreed.[^40]

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

22     After prying the Accused’s fingers off, the Complainant tried to get out from under the table by crawling on her knees. As she did so, the Accused grabbed her around her hips and waist and pulled her back. To prevent herself from returning to the same position, the Complainant _“grabbed on to the leg of the table”_ with her arms. The Accused hugged her from behind, placing his torso against her and his arms around her. The Complainant surmised that the Accused was trying to prevent her from leaving from under the table. To release herself from his embrace, she grabbed his arms and tried to remove them. The Complainant testified that _“it was a struggle”_ to do so.[^41] She also explained that she did not say anything to the Accused during the struggle as she was _“quite out of breath”_.[^42] After about a minute and a half (in her estimation), the Accused let her go and crawled out from under the table first. She followed suit.

23     The Complainant asked the Accused to take her somewhere she could smoke. She explained that although she was feeling shaken and unsure of how to react, she wanted to break the tension between them. To do so, she wanted to take a walk and go elsewhere, but required the Accused’s assistance as it was her first time in the Building and it looked like quite a maze.[^43] Explaining why she did not just leave, she testified:[^44]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

\[Y\]ou said you wanted him to bring you somewhere else. Why didn’t you just leave?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, I asked him to bring me down, uh to smoke a cigarette. Uh, and uh, I guess to answer why I didn’t leave, um, **it was in the middle of the night and there was no mode of transport**. And also, um, I --- I didn’t want to leave a bad impression. I didn’t want to make him feel --- feel bad, you know. **I don’t want to make things hostile.** I mean, if --- usually, if its someone I didn’t know, I would have just gotten up, maybe like, you know, just left. Um, but this --- this is different because we --- **we have gotten to** --- to **know each other already** and --- yah. **I just didn’t have it in me to** --- yah, to **just say something to him or just walk off.** And, um, considering, um how we were alone in the school and it seemed empty, um, the last thing that I wanted was to, uh, turn him into like an enemy.

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

24     The Complainant and the Accused subsequently left the room for a smoke break. CCTV footage shows that at 4.47 a.m., while walking to the lift, the Complainant gave the Accused a _“playful kick”_. She explained that she did so to break the tension between them and assumed, at that point, that he would not make further advances. The Accused walked on, seemingly oblivious to the Complainant’s act behind him.[^45] At 4.49 a.m., whilst in the lift, the Accused held the Complainant’s hand, but she responded by letting go and moving her hand away.[^46]

25     After exiting the lift, the Complainant and the Accused left the Building for a smoke break. The Complainant leaned against the railing and the Accused stood behind her. As she was _“taken aback”_ by the _“body to body contact”_, she moved aside.[^47] The Accused then moved towards the railing and stood beside her.[^48] The Complainant did not say anything as she felt embarrassed and did not want to similarly embarrass the Accused.[^49] At some juncture during the smoke break, she asked the Accused about his first impressions of her as she wanted to gauge what he thought of her and understand his intentions towards her.[^50] She also explained that she initiated the conversation as she did not like silence.[^51] As the Complainant and the Accused walked back to the Building, he put his hand around her waist. She testified that she moved away and walked in a different direction as she was _“attached”_, and it felt wrong.[^52]

#### Interactions after the first smoke break

26     Once inside the Building, the Complainant and the Accused took the lift to level 3. As the lift was ascending, the Accused brushed some hair from the Complainant’s face. As they exited the lift, he placed his arm around her waist. She responded by quickening her pace.[^53] The Complainant proceeded to a female toilet and the Accused followed suit as he claimed the male toilet was too far away. The Complainant entered a cubicle whilst the Accused remained outside. Whilst she was inside the cubicle, the Accused sprinkled some water over the door.[^54]

27     At about 5.05 a.m., the parties returned to the study room. As the air-conditioning was not functioning and it was stuffy, the Complainant sat on a table facing the door where she expected to feel cool air entering the room. The Accused stepped forward and stood in front of her, between her legs. He tried to push the Complainant down onto the table, but she propped herself on her elbows and sat back upright. The Accused then attempted to kiss the Complainant thrice, but she managed to dodge his kisses each time. Thereafter, the Accused hugged the Complainant tightly. She responded by trying to push him away. She also told him _“to stop and go away”_. The Accused stepped back a little and adjusted his pants with one hand. The Complainant did not look down as she did not want to know what the Accused was doing but surmised that he was removing his penis from his pants as she soon felt _“something warm”_ on her thigh. To _“break out of the situation”_ the Complainant kept telling the Accused that they should return to the smoking area as the room felt hot and she wanted to smoke again. The Accused told her, _“I’ll bring you down if you kiss me.”_ The Complainant did not acquiesce. Instead, she kept telling the Accused that she wanted to go down as she really needed to smoke. The Complainant testified that this was just an excuse to leave the room as she did not actually need to smoke. She explained that she was _“hoping that by whining, he would just give in and say, okay, let’s go down.”_ Soon after, the Accused adjusted his pants and the warm feeling on the Complainant’s thigh was gone. She thus surmised that the Accused had placed his penis back in his pants.[^55]

28     At about 5.31 a.m., the Accused and the Complainant left the study room for a second smoke break. As the lift descended, the Accused stood in front of the Complainant and hugged her. She responded by nudging him away as she felt awkward.[^56] Once outside the Building, the parties engaged in conversation as the Complainant smoked. While walking back to the Building, the Accused placed his arm around the Complainant’s back and lightly touched her right breast over her shirt. The Complainant was offended as she had not consented to his act. She responded by walking faster to _“get away from his hand”_. She did not say anything as she did not want to embarrass the Accused and also believed that he would not persist as they were outdoors at the time.[^57]

#### Interactions after the second smoke break

29     As the parties walked towards the Building at about 5.42 a.m.. the Complainant looked around to see if there was anywhere else she could go. She was also gauging the time to determine if the MRT system had started running. After entering the lift lobby of the Building, the Complainant faced away from the Accused as she was offended and did not want to look at him. She testified that rather than telling him off, she decided to ignore him and look away.[^58] The Complainant and the Accused stood at opposite ends when they entered the lift.[^59]

30     Upon returning to the study room, the Complainant sat on a chair as she was really tired. The Accused approached her and sat on her lap, his legs hanging to the Complainant’s right. He then turned his body such that he was facing her and in this position, hugged her. The Complainant felt suffocated and reacted by trying to push the Accused away. She also told him to _“go away”_ and _“stop it”_. As he did not comply and remained seated on her, the Complainant summoned her energy and stood up. This caused the Accused to slide down her body and fall onto the floor.[^60]

31     As there was an uncomfortable silence between them, and, as she did not perceive the Accused’s latest act to be a sexual advancement (she described it instead as the Accused behaving _“like a kid”_), the Complainant browsed through one of his files and made conversation so that things would not be so tense and hostile.[^61] As a _“warning”_ for him to _“back off”_ and _“not to try anything further”_, she also told the Accused that she had studied law and knew martial arts.[^62]

32     As they spoke, the Accused lined-up several chairs along a wall and lay down on the makeshift bed he had assembled. The Complainant tidied the room because she was preparing to leave.[^63] She testified that she did not check her phone to determine what time it was as they had just returned from outisde and it _“did not look like it was anywhere near 6:00”_ as it was still dark. She also explained that she did not feel the need to check her phone as she planned to leave when she saw daylight behind the blinds, indicating that it was morning.[^64]

33     Noticing that the Accused was asleep, the Complainant decided to have a short nap as she had planned to go to the gym after leaving the Building. Explaining her decision to have a nap instead of leaving immediately, the Complainant testified:[^65]

>   
| 

A

 | 

\[I\] wanted to leave because I felt that he was a threat, um, then, until he took a nap, yah. When he took a nap I --- I mean, **he couldn’t do anything when he’s napping.**

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Did it cross your mind that he could wake up and then do something to --- to you that you would not like?

 |
| 

A

 | 

If that crossed my mind, I wouldn’t have slept.

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

\[W\]ere you not concerned at that point given what has happened in those last 2 hours that Yan Ru may further make physical advances towards you while you were sleeping?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**I didn’t think he would be so daring as to approach someone who is unconscious at that point of time.**

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

34     The Complainant thus lay on the floor, on her back, near the blinds. She marked her approximate position in the room on Exhibit P6-7. She chose to lie on the other side of the room, about 3 metres away from the Accused, as this was the furthest available spot away from him and she thought it was appropriate for there to be some distance between a male and female friend when they were asleep. The Complainant used part of her jacket (seen in Exhibit P6-17) as a pillow and the hood of the jacket to cover her eyes from the glare of the fluorescent lights. She drifted to sleep immediately as she had not slept the night before. She knew she would awaken after a while as she was sleeping on the ground.[^66]

#### The offence

35     The Complainant subsequently awoke as she _“felt a weight”_ on her abdomen, near her chest. She was confused when she first awoke as she opened her eyes and saw complete darkness. She lifted her jacket when she remembered that it was covering her eyes and saw the Accused kneeling atop her, looking down at her face. The Complainant testified that the weight she felt was from the Accused kneeling down and partially sitting on her torso; around her chest and her ribs.[^67] She explained what she experienced in the following terms:

>

Examination-in-Chief [^68]

 |
| 

A

 | 

\[I\] was just **really shocked**. Um, I had no words --- un ---and I **needed time to process what was happening because when I woke up, I was in a daze.** So, it took me some time to process and, um, I also **felt** like a --- something like **a rocking motion coming from the accused and his body** and **I felt something** near my face --- **near the right side of my face, close to my chin.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

\[O\]ver which part of your body was the accused kneeling? In other words, where was his torso in relation to your body?

 |
| 

A

 |

You say you felt something near your face specifically near the right side of your face. What was this something?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It was the **accused’s**, uh, **penis**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How could you tell that it was the accused’s penis?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I --- **I did not look at it** because I did not want to see it **but I could gauge** from --- **from how he was kneeling down** and, um, I mean, there was --- **there can only be one thing sticking out from, you know, like near your legs**, so, yah. And he was, um --- **he was moving in a motion which suggested, um, masturbation**, yah.

\[…\]

 |
| 

A

 | 

He was moving his body back and forth. If I have to describe it, I will say it’s **almost like** he was, um --- **he was performing coitus**, yah.

Q

 | 

\[N\]ow, at this point **when you first saw him**, right, **was he already masturbating?**

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Yes, he was.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Did you see him masturbating?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I was too shocked to look down but **I said he was masturbating due to the rocking back and forth motion.**

Q

\[N\]ow when you say that there was a rocking motion which part of his body was that was (sic) rocking?

 |
| 

A

 | 

His hips.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And where were his hands?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I did not see it? So you got to understand I was quite in shock. I cannot give you every … single detail … I remember seeing one of his hands --- I believe it was his right hand --- he was holding the table that was behind me.

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

 | 

\[M\]aybe we can all reference to photograph number 7 … on the left side of the picture, there’s a table with a hoodie. That was the table which he was holding on to.

 |
| 

 | 

\[…\]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

\[B\]ecause of his rocking motion, you believed him to be masturbating?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Correct. And I also didn’t see his left hand holding on to the table … so, from there, **I gauged that he was holding his penis and he was masturbating.**

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

36     The Complainant testified that she did not feel any direct contact between the Accused’s penis and her, _“but \[it felt like\] it was very near … 1 to 2cm away from my face.”_[^70] She explained her reaction to seeing the Accused masturbating over her:

\[S\]o, can you tell us what happened next?

 |

A

 | 

Um, so after I --- I processed all that was happening, um, I had---I looked him in the eye, uh, and, um, I had a stern look. **I make sure I have a stern look. I looked at him in the eye** and, uh, **I said**, quote **“Get off me”. And I said it sternly**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How long did it take you to process all that was happening before you said the words “Get off me” to the accused?

I will say it just seem like a while but I will say a few seconds --- 5 seconds.

 |

How did the accused respond when you said to him “Get off me”?

**He said** to me, I quote “**Wait**”.

Q

 | 

How were you feeling at this point?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Shocked**, um, I felt **degraded** not only because of all that’s happened but even after I told him to get off me, he had the cheek to ask me to wait. **It was like I had no other choice. What I said didn’t matter**, yah. **Felt helpless**, lah.

Q

 | 

\[D\]id you feel degraded because you felt he shouldn’t have asked you to wait like you had no choice?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**I felt degraded because he was straddling on top of me, masturbating.** Um, and **including when I told him to get off me, he said “Wait”. It was … the entire thing.**

|

37     The Complainant testified that she did not scream, shout or physically retaliate after the Accused told her to _“wait”_, as she was in a state of shock:

Q

 | 

After the accused said to you, “wait”, did you say anything else to the accused?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, I did not.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Why didn’t you say anything else?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Honestly, I --- I don’t know. I --- I mean, **when you’re in such a position**, you --- **you don’t really think about anything else**. I was tired … and if … he wasn’t going to, you know, stop the first time I said it, why would he stop the second time.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You said earlier that you felt helpless. Are you able to elaborate?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, **I was in a position where I was pinned down by the weight of him even after asking to get off me** and right after everything that I have done physically, body-language wise … at some point in time, I actually also told him that I studied the law and, um --- and I also learned martial arts. That acted as like a subtle threat like a warning … sort of to tell him to back off as if the non-verbals weren’t enough. So, I guess when you asked me why I felt helpless, it’s, you know, even after all this happened, **I still end up in that position where even my words had no weight to it**.

I did not.

38     The Complainant testified that the Accused ejaculated on her hair, the right side of her neck and her face (near her chin and ear), about 3 to 4 seconds after he told her to _“wait”_.[^75] She explained how she felt when the Accused’s semen landed on her:[^76]

>   
| 

A

 | 

My **face felt really hot** … I was **embarrassed** and frankly I --- I --- **I couldn’t move. I was just stuck** there … really didn’t know what to think or feel but I just remembered my face feeling really hot and I felt embarrassed and, um, **kind of angry**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

\[W\]hy were you angry?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I mean to be **disrespected and degraded** in that manner … kind of felt like a slut and a whore.

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

39     Explaining that she did not consent to the Accused’s act of masturbation and ejaculation on her, the Complainant testified:[^77]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Did you consent to the accused’s act?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Well, um, firstly, **I was asleep, so I did not consent or invite him to**, uh, **kneel over my body because I was asleep** and, um, **I also verbally tell him to get off me, so that is exactly the opposite of consent.** And furthermore, he had never asked in the entire course of the night for my permission to do anything.

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

40     The Complainant recounted lying on the floor for 2 to 3 minutes as she did not know what to do and was _“still in shock”_ that the Accused had ejaculated on her. She could not bring herself to say anything to the Accused as he wiped his semen from her face, the right side of her neck and her hair with tissue paper. He discarded these pieces of tissue paper in a plastic bag. Shortly after, the Complainant told herself that she had to _“get out”_ as it was the _“last straw”_. As she began packing her things, the Complainant took the Accused’s file and _“memorised his particulars, the course, the school (sic) full name, full address and recited it back to him_”. She also told him that he would hear from her lawyers. The Complainant did this to _“let him know that he messed with the wrong person and to let him know that \[she would\] do something about it.”_ The Accused did not say anything but when the Complainant left the room, he told her that he would walk her down.[^78] She told him it was not necessary and told him to wait for her lawyer’s letter.

41     As the Complainant made her way out, the Accused apologized repeatedly and asked her to _“let \[him\] make it up to \[her\].”_ He also offered to let her punch him since she knew martial arts. The Complainant refrained from doing so and told the Accused, again, to wait for her lawyer’s letter.[^79]

42     CCTV footage shows the Complainant and the Accused along a corridor on level 3 of the Building at about 6.31 a.m. The Complainant turned thrice to respond to the Accused who was telling her she could punch him. She told him _“his point wasn’t valid”_.[^80] The Complainant then made her way to the ground level of the Building, with the Accused following behind.

#### The Complainant reports the offence

43     At the security gantry, the Complainant asked Mr Woo San Nin (“Mr Woo”), the security officer on duty at the Building, for the nearest police station. Mr Woo told the Complainant to call the police instead. As Mr Woo was not fluent in English, the Complainant showed him, through physical actions, that the Accused had masturbated on her. Mr Woo told the Accused to stand outside the security gantry. He complied but continued pleading with the Complainant, asking her not to call the police.[^81] However, as the Complainant believed the Accused had committed a crime[^82], she called the police hotline at 6.37 a.m. and reported – _“I was resting at the said location and a person has cum on my hair. I have his particulars and details. Police please come.”_[^83] When police officers subsequently arrived, the Complainant recounted the incident to them.

44     The Complainant recounted the anxiety she had experienced following the incident. She could not sleep for a few days and had difficulty focusing in school as she kept replaying the incident in her mind.[^84]

### (PW2) Woo San Nin’s Evidence

45     Mr Woo was the security officer on duty at the Building on 8 January 2019. Mr Woo testified that on the morning in question, a lady informed him that she wanted to make a police report as a male had _“misbehaved”_ towards her.[^85] It was not in dispute that the lady was the Complainant and the male was the Accused.

46     Mr Woo described the Complainant as being in a _“very angry”_ and _“stressful”_ state. He also recalled the Accused kneeling down and asking for the Complainant’s forgiveness.[^86]

### Summary of the Prosecution’s Submissions

47     Relying on the Complainant’s evidence, admissions and omissions in the Accused’s police statement (Exhibit P9), as well as inconsistencies in the Accused’s testimony in Court, the Prosecution contended that the Accused knew that the Complainant did not consent to the act, and his persistence with the act despite this knowledge, betrayed his intention to outrage the Complainant’s modesty.[^87]

48     In this regard, it was submitted that nothing the Complainant did before or during the act, could be construed as express or implied consent:

> a.     the Complainant did not give and neither did the Accused solicit, her express consent to the act;[^88]

> b.     the Complainant was in no state to consent to the act as she was initially asleep or otherwise disoriented at its initiation;[^89]

> c.     upon coming to, the Complainant told the Accused to stop and get off her, thus expressly communicating her dissent to the act which the Accused willfully ignored despite the clear import of her words;[^90]

> d.     the Complainant’s prior interactions with the Accused did not amount to implicit consent to the act. On the contrary, they established a pattern of the Accused making unsolicited advances and the Complainant rejecting these advances (either expressly or through her body language); which was the very opposite of consent. The Prosecution noted that the Accused himself agreed that the Complainant had rejected a number of these advances;[^91] and

> e.     the Complainant’s conduct immediately after the act, underscored her lack of consent.[^92]

49     The Prosecution also submitted that the Accused’s admissions in Exhibit P9, disclosed that he fully intended to gratify himself at the Complainant’s expense. [^93]

50     On the issue of the credibility of the parties, the Prosecution contended that the Accused’s testimony was rife with inconsistencies and lies which showed that he was a witness unworthy of credit.[^94] In contrast, the Complainant’s testimony vis-à-vis the act, was substantially corroborated in all material respects by the undisputed facts and the Accused’s admissions, save for his caveat that her _“stop”_ did not mean stop.[^95] The Prosecution further highlighted that the Accused’s evidence also materially corroborated the Complainant’s testimony that she had rejected a number of his advances throughout the night.[^96] The Prosecution thus submitted that whilst the Complainant was an unusually convincing witness, the aforesaid standard did not apply in the present case as the Complainant’s evidence was substantially corroborated and did not form the sole basis for conviction.[^97]

51     As regards the Defence’s contention that the Complainant ought to have left if she was uncomfortable with the Accused’s advances in the course of the night, the Prosecution submitted that the focus should be on what the Complainant did in response to the acts, rather than what she ought to have done. In this vein, the Prosecution highlighted that the Complainant had made plain her rejection of the Accused’s advances through her words and body language. The Prosecution also contended that the Complainant’s explanations for not leaving earlier (_viz._ she did not think the Accused would make further advances, did not think there was public transport available at that time and did not want to offend the Accused), were reasonable and did not detract from her credibility.[^98]

## The Defence’s Case

### The Accused’s Evidence

52     The Accused was the only witness for the Defence. In sum, he testified that there was growing intimacy between the parties as the night progressed and the Complainant was fine with his sexual advances. The salient parts of his evidence are summarized below.

53     In early January 2019, the Accused (then 22 years old) initiated contact with the Complainant after coming across her Instagram account. The parties subsequently continued communicating on Telegram; their conversations centering primarily on schoolwork and the courses they were enrolled in.[^99] There was nothing of a sexual nature in the text messages and the Accused even asked the Complainant to address him as _“kor”_ (which means big brother in English) as he _“treated and texted her as if she’s a younger sister”_.[^100]

54     On 7 January 2019, the parties met at Kith Café near the University. The Accused had initiated the meet-up as he wanted to study and see what the Complainant was like in person.[^101] The Accused testified that there was no awkwardness between them during this meeting and described their interactions as _“very friendly”_. Though the Accused initially sat beside the Complainant, he moved to sit across from her after she told him that she wanted some space. When the Complainant’s drink arrived, the Accused asked her if she was _“saliva conscious”_. When she replied that she was not, the Accused tried her drink. He then moved to sit beside her as he was curious about the work she was doing on her laptop. The Accused asked the Complainant if she was afraid of tickles. When she replied that she was not, he started _“poking her tummy”_. He explained that he was trying to be playful with her and ascertain if she was comfortable with their interactions. After several pokes, the Complainant gently pushed the Accused’s hands away. He inferred that she wanted to continue with her work. The Accused poked the Complainant’s tummy once more, just prior to leaving her at Kith Café.[^102]

55     In the course of their ensuing conversation on Telegram, the Accused asked the Complainant if she wanted to study overnight. Since they both had assignments to work on and he was attracted to her, he was hoping to spend some time getting to know her. The parties agreed to meet in the University that same night. Under cross-examination, the Accused accepted that from the Telegram messages, it was clear that the purpose of the meet-up was to study.[^103]

56     When the Complainant arrived at the Building at about 1.00 a.m. on 8 January 2019, the Accused led her to a study room on level 3. Under cross-examination, the Accused accepted that prior to the Complainant’s arrival, he had not told her where they would be studying that night. He also disclosed that in the course of their conversation on Telegram a day earlier, he had sent the Complainant a video of the library.[^104]

57     According to the Accused, the atmosphere in the study room was nice and relaxed as the parties did their own work. At one point, the Accused playfully placed both his feet on the Complainant’s thighs as he wanted to get closer to her. There were several instances when his feet fell off. When this occurred, the Complainant would place the Accused’s feet back on her thighs.[^105]

58     After this interaction, the Complainant told the Accused that she was feeling warm and proceeded to change in a nook of the study room where he could not see her. While she was changing, he asked, _“what if I peek?”_ and she responded by saying, _“I trust you”_. The Accused testified that he was very happy with the Complainant’s response as he believed she was comfortable with him.[^106]

59     When the Complainant subsequently lay on the floor with her laptop, the Accused joined her and positioned himself such that their shoulders were touching. While watching a movie, the Complainant agreed to the Accused’s suggestion to move under the table so that they could avoid the glare of the lights. As the Accused wanted to get closer to the Complainant, he placed his right arm on her back. When she did not react, he moved his hand close to her right underarm and asked her what would happen if he tickled her. The Complainant told him playfully that she would hit or punch him. The Accused tickled the Complainant’s underarm and she _“flicked”_ his forehead gently. This happened several times during the movie. The Accused testified that they were very comfortable with each other and getting more playful and intimate.[^107] Under cross-examination, the Accused accepted that he was unable to recall if the Complainant had used her arm to block his hand.[^108]

60     As the movie ended, the Accused began tickling the Complainant’s waist. He then moved his right hand under her singlet and touched her right breast over her bra. The Complainant responded by giggling. As she sat up, the Accused moved his left hand under her singlet and touched her left breast over her bra. The Complainant _“was fine with it”_ but _“gently removed”_ his hands after a few seconds. When she did so, the Accused decided _“to take things step by step and not carry on with it”_. When the Complainant tried to get out from under the table, the Accused put both his hands on her waist and pulled her back gently towards him. When he did so, the Complainant held on to a table leg. The Accused thought the Complainant did not want to get closer to him and decided to get out from under the table. She followed suit. Once they were both standing, the Accused hugged the Complainant. He told her _“hug yi xia”_ (which means hug for a while, in English) and she then placed her hands around his waist.[^109]

61     Thereafter, the parties left the study room and proceeded to the ground floor of the Building for a smoke break. During the break, the Complainant was comfortable with the Accused hugging her from behind. At some point, she asked him about his first impressions of her. He told her that she was friendly. He believed that the Complainant was interested in wanting to know more about him.[^110]

62     Two events occurred upon the parties’ return to the study room, although the Accused was unable to recall the sequence in which they occurred. In one incident, the Accused sat on the Complainant and hugged her. He then tried to kiss her, albeit unsuccessfully. Soon after, the Complainant stood up and the Accused got off her lap. When she sat down again, the Accused sat astride on her lap and hugged her. He also tried to kiss her again but was unable to do so. When he tried to unhook her bra, the Complainant stood up and he slid off her. The Accused thus surmised that she did not want him to unhook her bra.[^111]

63     In the other incident, the Complainant was seated on a table when the Accused stood in front of her and hugged her. He then kissed her cheek and she said _“ew”_ in a playful tone before wiping her cheek. As the Accused believed that the Complainant was fine with his advances, he proceeded to pull down his shorts, expose his penis and place it on her thigh. Though there was no conversation between them thereafter, the Accused described the mood as intimate. After several minutes the Accused pulled-up his shorts and the parties returned to the ground floor of the Building for another smoke break.[^112]

64     During the second smoke break, the Accused hugged the Complainant from behind and touched her breasts occasionally. Upon returning to the study room, the Complainant read through some documents in the Accused’s file. As she did so, he touched her breast. She did not react. The Accused then lined-up some chairs and lay on them as he was tired and wanted to have a nap before his class later that morning. Before falling asleep, he advised the Complainant to do the same.[^113]

65     When he subsequently awoke a while later, he saw the Complainant lying on the ground with her jacket on her face. The Accused explained that he was happy to see her as it showed that she enjoyed his company and was willing to spend time with him. The Accused testified that he knelt on the ground with the Complainant between his knees and touched her left breast to wake her up. Once she awoke and removed her jacket, he pulled down his pants, exposed his penis and rubbed it across her breasts. Soon after, the Complainant said _“stop”_ in a _“jest (sic) manner”_. The Accused told the Complainant _“awhile more”_ and continued rubbing his penis across her breasts. He ejaculated on the top-right of her shoulder. According to the Accused, the Complainant did not have any reaction to him and there was no conversation between them. As the Complainant lay on the floor without moving, the Accused wiped his semen off her with tissue. He discarded the tissue and sat on a chair.[^114]

66     The Complainant eventually stood up and packed her belongings. Whilst doing so, she threw a tactical pen onto the table. She then flipped through the Accused’s documents, found his personal particulars and read out his name and address. She told the Accused that she knew martial arts and studied law and told him to wait for a lawyer’s letter. As she walked out of the room, the Accused followed her and apologized repeatedly as he did not want to get into trouble. At the guard house on the ground floor of the Building, the Accused kept asking her not to call the police. He called his father, but the Complainant refused to speak to him.[^115]

67     At the time of the offence, the Accused was in a romantic relationship with a woman whose identity has not been disclosed to date.[^116]

### Summary of the Defence’s Submissions

68     Relying on inferences drawn from the surrounding facts and circumstances preceding the act, as well as the Accused’s evidence as to what transpired during the act, the Defence contended that the Accused had not intended to outrage the Complainant’s modesty.

69     In this regard, the Defence submitted that the Accused believed from the Complainant’s conduct throughout the night, that she had consented to all his physical advances and that “they were progressing in terms of physical intimacy”.[^117] Flowing from this, the main thrust of the Defence case was that the Accused did not think the Complainant was withholding consent when she subsequently told him to “stop” during the act, because of (a) the playful, coy tone she used; and (b) the preceding interactions between the parties through the night.[^118] Both these facts informed the Accused’s state of mind at the time of the act and it was only when the Complainant subsequently told him to expect a lawyer’s letter, that he realized she was unhappy with him.[^119]

70     In evaluating the evidence, the Defence submitted that the Court should accept the Accused’s testimony and reject the Complainant’s evidence as she was not an unusually convincing witness for two main reasons:

> a.     her account of the incident was inherently incredible, _viz._ her reason for agreeing to an overnight study session, her decision to change in the classroom and move under the table to continue watching the movie, as well as the lack of protest in respect of the three incidents where the Accused had crossed the line;[^120] and

> b.     her claim that she was uncomfortable with the Accused’s advances throughout the night was inconsistent with her actions, _viz._ her failure to leave.[^121]

71     The Defence also submitted that the Prosecution’s case was undermined by the Complainant’s testimony that there was no physical contact between the Accused’s penis and her chest at the time of the act. In this vein, it was argued that it was unclear what the Complainant’s exact grievance was.[^122]

## The Applicable Legal Principles

72     It is settled law that the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant may be the sole basis for a conviction. However, such evidence must be “unusually convincing”: see _Public Prosecutor v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”) at \[87\]; _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\]; _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ \[2012\] 3 SLR 3 at \[111\] and _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> (“_Liton_”) at \[37\].

73     In _GCK_ at \[88\], the Court of Appeal stated that the ‘unusually convincing’ standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”. As to what would constitute ‘unusually convincing’ evidence, the Court of Appeal observed as follows:

> 88… in \[_Haliffie_\], this court considered that (citing _\[Liton_\] at \[39\]):

>> … complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’.

> The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’ demeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the witness’s evidence.

74     At \[92\] of _GCK_, the Court of Appeal stressed that the ‘unusually convincing’ standard is not meant to impose a mandatory warning from the judge to himself or herself. At the last stage of the evaluation of the evidence and just before a conviction is found, it serves as a cautionary reminder to ensure that the trial judge has an awareness of the dangers of convicting the offender on uncorroborated evidence, and that he or she undertakes a rigorous and holistic assessment of the evidence.

75     Where the evidence of a complainant is not ‘unusually convincing’, an accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s evidence: see _Liton_ at \[37\]. As to what can amount to corroborative evidence, the strict approach is set out in _R v Baskerville_ <span class="citation">\[1916\] 2 KB 658</span> at 667 and requires independent evidence implicating the accused in a material particular. However, in the local context, a more liberal approach is advocated and the trial judge retains the necessary flexibility to treat relevant evidence as corroborative. What is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate: see _Liton_ at \[42\] – \[43\].

76     The more liberal approach treats a subsequent complaint made by the complainant as corroboration provided that the statement implicating the offender was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence: see _AOF_ at \[173\] citing _Public Prosecutor v Mardai_ <span class="citation">\[1950\] MLJ 33</span>.

77     With this framework in mind, I now turn to analyse the evidence and discuss the main issues that were before me.

## The Issues

78     As the Accused did not deny the _actus reus_ of the charge, the key issue that arose for my determination was whether the act was committed with the requisite _mens rea_, that is, whether the Accused acted with the intention of outraging the Complainant’s modesty. This turned on the following sub-issues:

> a.     whether the Complainant consented to the act; and

> b.     if she did not consent, whether the Accused knew that she did not consent.

79     As intention is purely an operation of the mind, it can only be proved by drawing inferences from the surrounding circumstances and the acts of the person: _Sim Yew Thong v Ng Loy Nam Thomas and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 186</span> at \[18\]. The nature of the parties’ interactions in hours preceding the act is thus relevant and it is to this issue that I first turn, before considering their evidence vis-à-vis the act itself.

## The Parties’ Antecedent Relationship Did Not Suggest An Air of Growing Intimacy

80     Having scrutinized the evidence, I was satisfied that the Complainant was a truthful witness whose evidence as to the parties’ interactions in the hours preceding the act, was both cogent and reliable. I was fortified in this view by the fact that her testimony in relation to several key incidents throughout the night was materially corroborated by parts of the Accused’s own police statement (Exhibit P9) and his testimony in Court.

81     In contrast, I found the Accused’s account of budding intimacy and mutual playful banter between the parties, to be nothing short of tortured. His oft-repeated refrain about the purported mood between the parties and their growing intimacy was contrived and materially at odds with portions of his police statement which he accepts, was given voluntarily _hours after_ the incident (when the events would have been fresh in his mind) and was recorded accurately.[^123]

### The Complainant’s Rejection of Several Advances is Corroborated by the Accused Himself

82     Upon close examination, it was apparent that the Complainant’s rejection of the Accused’s advances through verbal and non-verbal cues in the hours preceding the act, was in fact largely corroborated by the Accused himself, thereby undermining his claim that there was growing intimacy between them. I elaborate.

#### The Complainant did not consent to the Accused groping her breasts and resisted when he tried to pull her under the table

83     In respect of this incident, the Complainant testified that she pried away the Accused’s fingers when he groped her breasts and had thereafter resisted his attempt to pull her back under the table by grabbing onto the table leg (_supra_ at \[21\] and \[22\]). I found her evidence corroborated by both the Accused’s testimony and his statement to the police.

84     It would be recalled that under cross-examination, the Accused agreed that he had stopped touching the Complainant’s breasts and had to _“control”_ himself when, in his words, she _“pulled off”_ and _“removed”_ his hands.[^124] On his own testimony, it was therefore clear that the Accused not only accepted that the Complainant had physically stopped him from groping her breasts, he in fact also admitted to having restrained himself from groping the Complainant’s breasts further; his reaction clearly borne from the realization that the Complainant (by her actions) did not consent to his advance.

85     In the course of his evidence, the Accused also agreed that the Complainant had indeed held onto the table leg when he tried to pull her back under the table. When asked by his lawyer why he thought the Complainant was holding onto the table leg, the Accused stated – _“I thought that maybe she didn’t want to get closer to me … so she used that as a form to tell me.”_[^125] This not only coheres with the Complainant’s evidence but reveals that the Accused was fully aware from the Complainant’s body language, that she was rejecting his attempt to draw her closer to him.

86     Curiously, under cross-examination, the Accused prevaricated on why the Complainant had held onto the table leg, claiming not only that she voluntarily returned under the table when he pulled her back gently, but also describing the interaction between them as _“playful”_.[^126] Quite apart from being inconsistent with his earlier testimony, I found the Accused’s claim to fly in the face of his own police statement, where he admitted that the Complainant had _“resisted_” his attempt to pull her back under the table.[^127] When confronted with the discrepancy in his accounts, the Accused attempted to explain away the damning admission in his police statement by weakly claiming that he had merely been referring to the fact that the Complainant was holding onto the table leg, and that this did not mean she was resisting him.[^128] I found this explanation untenable given the clear import of the word ‘resist’ and the Accused’s own understanding that the word meant _“trying to stop something from happening to me”_.[^129] Accordingly, I accepted the Accused’s admission in his statement, which corroborated the Complainant’s account, as the truth.

#### The Complainant moved aside during the first smoke break as she was clearly uncomfortable with the body contact between the parties

87     The Complainant testified that during the first smoke break the parties were standing at the railing when she moved to the side to distance herself from the Accused as she felt uncomfortable with the contact between their bodies when he stood close behind her.[^130] After stepping aside, the Complainant testified that she stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Accused (_supra_ at \[25\]). Pertinently, the Defence did not dispute this aspect of the Complainant’s evidence when she was testifying. Though the Defence initially suggested that the Complainant had moved aside to make way for a passing cyclist, Counsel did not challenge the Complainant’s explanation that there was ample space for the cyclist to cycle past and her vehement assertion that she moved because she was uncomfortable with the Accused standing close behind her.[^131]

88     I found the Complainant’s evidence of her discomfort, corroborated by the Accused’s admission in Exhibit P9 that she was _“uncomfortable”_ when he stood behind her and pushed her to the railing.[^132] When cross-examined, the Accused belatedly claimed that the Complainant had attributed her discomfort to the fact that it was _“squeezy”_.[^133] He also claimed that he continued to hug her after taking a step back and disagreed that she had moved aside because she did not want him to hug her. Though this was a marked departure from the Defence’s case when the Complainant was testifying, the Accused did not venture to provide any explanation for the same. I thus placed no weight on these belated assertions - it was clear to me from the Accused’s admission in his statement, that he was fully cognizant of the Complainant’s discomfort with their contact when he stood behind her; her discomfort made plain by her body language.

#### The Complainant rejected the Accused’s attempts to kiss her

89     The Complainant testified that upon the parties’ return to the study room after the first smoke break, she dodged the Accused’s attempts to kiss her. When he hugged her she tried to push him away and told him to _“stop and go away”_ (_supra_ at \[27\]).[^134] Again, I found that this aspect of her evidence was materially corroborated by the Accused’s police statement in which he made the following admission:[^135]

>   
| 

\[W\]hen we got back, I tried to kiss her. **She avoided.** I tried and she just **move her head, to avoid my kiss.** I can’t remember what she says, **I think she did tell me ‘no’. Basically, she didn’t want it.** (emphasis added)

 |

  
  

90     Unsurprisingly, the Accused took a diametrically different position in Court, bizarrely claiming that the Complainant had moved her head in a playful manner and not because she did not want to be kissed. He also claimed that he had managed to kiss her cheek once and she had responded by playfully saying _“ew”_.[^136] He also testified that it was not apparent to him then, that the Complainant did not want to be kissed. Again, the Accused proffered no cogent reason for these patently inconsistent versions and unconvincingly and implausibly (given that the statement was recorded hours after the incident) attributed the account in his statement to a purported defect in his memory.[^137] I thus rejected his claims and accepted the admission in his statement, which corroborated the Complainant’s account, as the truth.

#### The Complainant’s body language and conduct clearly communicated that she did not want the Accused’s exposed penis on her thigh

91     The Complainant testified that after avoiding the Accused’s attempts to kiss her and telling him to stop and go away, the Accused adjusted his pants and placed (what she assumed to be) his penis, which she described as being warm, on her thigh. To _“break out of the situation”_ the Complainant repeatedly told the Accused that she wanted to return to the smoking area as the room was hot and she wanted to smoke again. According to the Complainant, the Accused told her, _“I’ll bring you down if you kiss me.”_ She did not acquiesce and repeatedly told the Accused that she wanted to go down as she really needed to smoke.

92     The Complainant testified that this was just an excuse to leave the room as she did not actually need to smoke. She explained that she was _“hoping that by whining, \[the Accused\] would just give in and say, okay, let’s go down.”_ The Complainant also explained that she did not expressly tell the Accused to put his penis away because: (i) she did not look down to confirm that it was indeed his penis, and (ii) she was not really an _“outright person”_. Soon after, the Accused adjusted his pants and the Complainant testified that the warm feeling on her thigh was gone. She thus surmised that the Accused had placed his penis back in his pants.[^138]

93     Several points bear highlighting:

> a.     first, when the Complainant was on the stand, the Defence did not dispute (and by extension, thereby accepted) her assertion that she repeatedly asked the Accused to take her down to smoke.[^139] The Complainant’s testimony was also corroborated by Exhibit P9 where the Accused stated that the Complainant had _“said that the room \[was\] too hot and that she \[wanted\] to go down to smoke again”_;[^140]

> b.     second, though the Accused initially testified that there was a very intimate mood between the parties as his penis rested on the Complainant’s thigh, under cross-examination he admitted that the Complainant neither touched his penis nor reciprocated by doing anything intimate with him,[^141] thus corroborating the Complainant’s evidence that she did not reciprocate the Accused’s advance; and

> c.     third, under cross-examination, the Accused conceded that he eventually put his penis away as the Complainant did not do anything.[^142]

94     Taking the points together, not only does the Defence accept that the Complainant repeatedly asked to leave for another smoke break whilst the Accused had his penis on her lap, it is plain as day from the Accused’s own admissions under cross-examination that he _removed his penis_ from the Complainant’s thigh _of his own volition_, even though she had not expressly asked him to stop. The irresistible inference is that he did so because he understood the rejection inherent in her conduct and body language. In this regard, I found any assertion by the Defence to the contrary, incongruent with the Accused’s own admissions. It was clear to me that the Accused ceased with the act because even without any express indication to stop, he knew from the Complainant’s overall conduct and demeanour, that she did not want his penis on her thigh.

#### The Complainant clearly indicated that she did not want the Accused to hug her

95     The Complainant testified that when she sat on a chair in the study room after returning from the second smoke break, the Accused approached her, sat on her lap and hugged her. The Complainant felt suffocated and reacted by trying to push the Accused away. She also told him to _“go away”_ and _“stop it”_. When he did not comply, she stood up and this resulted in the Accused sliding off her body and falling onto the floor.[^143]

96     While the Accused could not recall precisely _when_ this incident occurred, he testified that he did sit on the Complainant twice, in succession. According to the Accused, when he first sat on the Complainant, he hugged her and tried to kiss her, but she stood up and he had to get off her lap. When she then sat down a second time, he sat on her lap again and tried to hug her and kiss her. According to the Accused, when he tried to unhook the Complainant’s bra, she stood up again and he slid off her.[^144]

97     Though the parties differed on the number of times the Accused had sat on the Complainant and the juncture at which the Accused had slid to the floor, there were several threads common to both accounts which materially corroborated the Complainant’s evidence that she did not consent to the Accused’s advance:

> a.     first, the Accused accepted that the Complainant did not reciprocate when he hugged her;[^145]

> b.     second, the Accused accepted that _soon after_ he had hugged the Complainant, she stood up from the chair;

> c.     third, while the Prosecution’s case that the Complainant stood-up in reaction to the Accused not complying with her request for him to get off her, differed from the Defence’s case that she stood up in reaction to the Accused trying to unhook her bra, there was unity between the parties in so far as they both accepted that – (i) the Complainant stood-up abruptly _in reaction to an advance_ the Accused had made while he was seated on her; and (ii) this resulted in him sliding off her body and falling to the ground;[^146] and

> d.     fourth, and most materially, the Accused admitted that he understood the Complainant’s act of standing-up to be a rejection of his advance.[^147] Although this admission was made in the context of his claim that the Complainant stood-up as she did not want him to unhook her bra, the undeniable fact is that the Accused was well aware from the Complainant’s physical reaction, that she was rejecting _an advance_ he had made whilst seated on her.

98     From the foregoing analysis, it was clear to me that the Accused was fully cognizant of the Complainant’s _consistent rejection_ of his advances which she communicated through various verbal and non-verbal cues in the hours leading to the act. This in turn debunked the Accused’s claim of growing mutual intimacy between the parties and readily laid to rest the Defence’s contention that the Complainant’s complete lack of physical or verbal protest throughout the night rendered her entire account inherently incredible.[^148] With respect, such an assertion was a gross mischaracterization of the Complainant’s evidence; a point I address in due course (at \[111\]).

### Material Aspects of the Defence Case Were Missing from Exhibit P9

99     In my judgement, the cogency of the Accused’s claims of growing intimacy was further undermined by the fact that material facets of the Defence’s case, offered in support of this contention, were conspicuously missing from his police statement. I provide several examples (in broad chronological order) of the more salient omissions that remained glaringly and unsatisfactorily accounted for.

100    First, was the Accused’s claim that the Complainant repeatedly picked-up and placed his feet on her thighs when it slipped off. While the Accused accepted that this was a material fact that supported his contention that the Complainant had entertained his advances, he could not explain why he had not shared this detail in his police statement. The veracity of the Accused’s claim was further undermined by the inconsistencies that arose in the course of his testimony at trial. I was mindful that the Accused initially claimed that _only_ the Complainant had repeatedly placed his feet on her thighs whenever it slipped-off.[^149] He subsequently vacillated under cross-examination, claiming that at times, _he too_ placed his feet back on the Complainant’s thighs. Instead of explaining the internal inconsistency in his account of this incident, the Accused chose to deny the discrepancy - a contention that was simply not borne-out upon a perusal of the transcripts.[^150]

101    Second, the Accused claimed that the Complainant’s decision to change in the room, indicated that she was comfortable with him. To this end, he testified that as she was changing, he asked her _“what if I peek?”_ to which she responded, _“I trust you”_ - this was _version one_ of what had purportedly transpired. The Accused testified that he had wanted to ascertain how the Complainant felt towards him and explained that he was very happy when she expressed her trust in him as this reflected how comfortable she was with him.[^151] I observed the following:

> a.     foremost, the Accused’s assertion in his evidence-in-chief was patently inconsistent with the Defence’s case when the Complainant was testifying, and it was put to her that she had merely told the Accused _“not to peek”_[^152] – _version two_. Taken literally, the latter in fact suggested that the Complainant did not trust the Accused; and thus ran counter to the Accused’s claim that there was an air of trust between them;

> b.     when confronted with the aforementioned discrepancy during cross-examination, the Accused volunteered a _third version_, claiming that the Complainant had said both statements to him. When questioned on the veracity of his ever-evolving story (as between his police statement, evidence-in-chief and cross-examination) on this issue, the Accused was only able to weakly and unconvincingly state that he was just recalling the incident to the best of his ability.[^153] I was unpersuaded by this perfunctory explanation; and

> c.     also rendering the Accused’s evidence on this issue highly suspect, was the fact that there was simply no mention of this purported exchange (in _any_ of the three iterations proffered by the Accused at trial) in paragraph \[7\] of his police statement which otherwise contained numerous insignificant details.

102    Third, the Accused claimed that the Complainant had giggled when he groped her breasts under the table. When the Complainant was testifying, the Defence had also alleged that the Accused had rubbed her crotch at this juncture.[^154] These significant details were not only missing from the Accused’s police statement despite the specific incident being canvassed, no cogent explanations for their omission were proffered, apart from the Accused’s weak and unconvincing generic claim that _“\[he\] stated the story as much as \[he\] could at that point of time.”_[^155]

103    Fourth, was the Accused’s claim that he had placed his hands around the Complainant’s waist and hugged her after they had emerged from under the table. He also asserted that the Complainant had reciprocated by doing the same to him. Notably, this was neither mentioned in the Accused’s police statement nor put to the Complainant when she was testifying, and the Accused could not account for this material omission apart from feebly maintaining that it had happened.[^156]

104    Fifth, the Accused claimed to have groped the Complainant’s breasts repeatedly during the second smoke break, a fact that was glaringly missing from his police statement despite the specific incident being canvassed. Under cross-examination he attributed this omission to a defect in his memory,[^157] an explanation that I found untenable in light of not only the materiality of the fact (since the Accused claimed that this was the first time the Complainant had not pulled his hands away from her breasts), but also given his ability to narrate numerous other insignificant details in his statement.

105    Sixth, the Accused claimed to have touched the Complainant’s breasts shortly after 5.42 a.m. while she was reading his documents. Not only was this fact missing from the Accused’s police statement, it was also internally inconsistent with the Defence’s _own_ case at trial – I was mindful that when the Complainant was testifying, it was put to her that the Accused had merely _tried_ to touch her chest. Again, the Accused could not explain this diametric shift in his case.[^158]

106    Seventh, the Accused alleged that following the incident, the Complainant had thrown a tactical pen on the table. Presumably, this was raised to show that the Complainant had a weapon available to her for protection throughout the night but had not used it. Again, not only was this fact missing from the Accused’s police statement, it was (without explanation) never put to the Complainant in cross-examination.[^159]

107    Finally, I looked at the Accused’s evidence vis-a-vis several interactions between the parties captured on CCTV, and observed as follows:

> a.     the Defence had not put several material details of its case to the Complainant in cross-examination -

>> i.        Timestamp 04:49:12 (s/no. 5, Tab 7 ASOF) [^160] : despite the Accused’s claim that the Complainant was _“fine”_ with him holding her hands in the lift and had _“allowed \[him\] to do so”_,[^161] the Defence failed to challenge the Complainant’s evidence that she had moved her hands away;[^162]

>> ii.        Timestamp 04:58:03 (s/no. 9, Tab 7 ASOF): the Accused’s claim that the Complainant was _“fine”_ with him placing his hand on her back[^163] was also never put to the Complainant despite her evidence that she had quickened her walking pace in reaction to what he did;[^164] and

>> iii.        Timestamp 05:31:36 (s/no. 10, Tab 7 ASOF): though the Accused claimed that the parties had engaged in a _“mutual”_ hug in the lift,[^165] under cross-examination, he accepted that the footage in fact showed the Complainant’s arms folded in front of her and conceded that she did not return the hug.[^166] Curiously, the Accused’s claim that the Complainant was _“fine”_ with his hug,[^167] was also never put to the Complainant despite her contrary testimony that she had nudged him away.[^168]

> b.     none of the aforementioned assertions featured in the Accused’s police statement; though these would no doubt have amounted to material facts that corroborated his contention that the Complainant had entertained his advances.

108    All things considered, I found that the internal inconsistencies in the Accused’s evidence cast a measure of doubt on the cogency of the Defence’s case and led to the irresistible inference that they were a series of ill-conceived afterthoughts manufactured to bolster the Accused’s claim of growing intimacy with the Complainant. In this connection, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused had shown himself to be a witness unworthy of credit.

109    For completeness, I would add that ultimately, I found no _unqualified_ mention in Exhibit P9 of the alleged mutually playful, _sexually_ intimate, coy mood between the parties, the mantra the Accused so readily bandied throughout the trial. On the contrary, the Accused’s statement contained numerous expressions such as, _“she avoided”_, _“she did tell me no”_, _“she didn’t want it”_, _“she resisted”_, _“it makes her uncomfortable”_ and _“she continues to struggle”_, all of which betrayed his knowledge that the Complainant neither welcomed nor consented to his sexual advances in the hours preceding the act.

### There was Nothing Inherently Incredible about the Complainant’s Account

110    I now turn to address several areas of the Complainant’s testimony which the Defence submitted, was inherently incredible (_supra_ at \[70a\]). Having considered the evidence in its entirety, I found that the Complainant had given perfectly reasonable explanations in response to the doubts the Defence had attempted to sow in her testimony. I deal with each of these grounds _in seriatim._

#### The Complainant clearly rejected each of the Accused’s advances

111    I begin with the Defence’s contention that the Complainant’s lack of protest in respect of the three incidents she had identified as having crossed the line (_viz._ the incidents involving groping of her breasts under the table, the placing of the Accused’s penis on her thigh and the Accused sitting on her lap), rendered her account implausible. I disagree. The Defence’s argument was premised on a _gross_ mischaracterization of the Complainant’s evidence and, for the reasons detailed at \[80\] to \[98\], was thus flawed. To my mind, there was nothing inherently incredible about the Complainant’s responses to the Accused as she had in her own way, rejected each of his advances (see also \[117\]).

112    For completeness, I address a point raised by the Defence in its submissions, which I have yet to canvass. It was argued that the Complainant’s playful kick as the parties proceeded for the first smoke break, showed that she was in good spirits and not unhappy with the Accused in any way.[^169] This was highlighted to buttress the Defence’s claim that the Complainant had in fact consented to the incident just prior to this, which involved the groping of her breasts under the table.

113    I looked to the Complainant’s testimony to understand her actions and place them in their proper context. In this regard, I noted both her explanation that she had given the Accused a _“playful kick”_ to break the tension between them,[^170] and her belief _then_ that the Accused would not make further advances since she had already communicated her disagreement with his earlier actions.[^171] The Complainant’s explanation, when seen in context (against her belief then, that the Accused would not persist with his overtures), was entirely believable. I therefore did not find her conduct to undermine her credibility.

#### The Complainant’s failure to leave during the night did not undermine the cogency of her evidence

114    In a similar vein, I did not find the Complainant’s failure to leave in the course of the night to undermine the credibility and cogency of her evidence that she did not consent to the Accused’s various advances.

115    First, it must be remembered that just as there is no typical victim and no typical sexual offender, there is no typical reaction to sexual assault. Rather than paying mere lip service to this maxim, we would do well as a society to reject the antediluvian notion that a real victim of sexual assault behaves in a prescribed way.

116    In the present case, I was satisfied that the Complainant had articulated reasonable explanations for her _seemingly_ counter-intuitive behaviour, most pertinent of which was her belief just prior to the commission of the act, that the Accused would not try to make any further advances towards her since he had fallen asleep (_supra_ at \[33\]). It was also her evidence that she had intended to leave in a manner that did not offend the Accused, once public transport was available.

117    While the decision not to leave earlier may no doubt have been unwise, especially with the wisdom of hindsight, I did not find that it undermined the cogency of the Complainant’s evidence. In assessing her responses, I agreed with the Prosecution that the inquiry must focus on what she _did_, rather than what she _ought_ to have done. In this regard, considering the matter in its entirety, I found that there was ample evidence to show that the Complainant’s responses to the Accused’s advances were not passive, neither did she initiate, acquiesce to or reciprocate the advances. Thus viewed, the mere failure to leave earlier did not detract from the fact that the Complainant had _unambiguously spurned_, either expressly or through her body language, the Accused’s advances at every turn.

118    Second, and more pertinently in the context of the present case, I found that the objective facts led to the irresistible inference that although the Complainant did not leave earlier, the _Accused was fully cognizant_ from the overall tenor of her responses throughout the night, that his advances were unwelcome. This was most apparent from the fact that he resiled from continuing further on _each_ occasion. As the Complainant astutely observed:[^172]

>   
| 

I felt my actions and non-verbals were enough to tell him that I did not agree with any of what he was doing … **if it didn’t work, I think we’ll have proceeded to do something further rather than stopping** three different times as well.

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

119    I return to this issue on the party’s interactions in the hours preceding the act, in due course (at \[133\] and \[134\]).

#### There was nothing untoward in the Complainant’s decision to change in the study room

120    While the Defence sought to cast the Complainant’s decision to change in the study room as incredible, I did not agree.[^173] There was no merit in the argument as the Accused himself accepted that the Complainant had not changed in plain view but out of his line of sight, in a _“corner of the room where it was blind spot”_.[^174] This cohered with the Complainant’s evidence.

121    I was also mindful that at the point when the Complainant changed, the Accused had yet to make any _sexual_ advances towards her and hence, there was no reason for her to question his intentions towards her.[^175]

122    I also found nothing untoward in the Complainant’s explanation that she had changed in a nook of the room where the Accused could not see her, as she did not want to disrupt his work by requiring him show her to the toilet. Her explanation was plausible and reasonable, a fact which the Accused himself eventually accepted.[^176]

#### There was nothing incredible about the Complainant’s reason for agreeing to a night study session or her decision to finish watching the movie under the table

123    Equally untenable, was the Defence’s submission that the Complainant’s reason for agreeing to meet the Accused, was not borne-out by the objective facts. First, I bore in mind that it was the Accused who invited the Complainant for a night study session.[^177] The Complainant accepted the invitation but indicated that she was only available that night or the following night (8 and 9 January 2019 respectively). Second and more importantly, the objective facts show that the Complainant did in fact work on and substantially complete her assignment (save for _“some editing”_ that remained) in the course of the night,[^178] which as the Prosecution highlighted, the Accused himself did not deny. I was thus in no doubt as to the Complainant’s motivations for agreeing to study with the Accused on 8 January 2019. The facts show that she had intended to work on her assignment and did in fact do so.

124    Next, contrary to the Defence’s assertion, I also did not find anything incredulous about the Complainant’s decision to finish watching the movie with the Accused under the table. While the Complainant was somewhat uncomfortable with the Accused’s initial proximity to her (when they were 2 cm apart with some shoulder to shoulder contact), she explained that she did not _“think much about it”_ and just decided to watch the movie with the Accused.[^179] As there had been no _sexual contact_ between them at this juncture, it was entirely conceivable that the Complainant was not wary of the Accused despite some discomfort with his proximity. I was also mindful that the Complainant’s subsequent decision to finish watching the movie under the table was a purely practical one, prompted by the glare of the lights that were overhead and were hurting her eyes. Pertinently, this was also the Accused’s explanation for moving under the table.[^180] I thus found it peculiar that the Defence took issue with this aspect of the Complainant’s evidence, particularly since the Complainant was neither cross-examined on the alleged incredulity of her explanation nor confronted with the insinuation that she was opening herself to the Accused’s advances by doing so.[^181]

### Concluding Remarks on the Parties’ Antecedent Interactions Throughout the Night

125    After careful examination of the evidence before me, I accepted the Complainant’s evidence that she had rejected each of the Accused’s advances in the hours preceding the act, her rebuff made plain to him verbally or through her body language. In this vein, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the evidence in fact established a pattern of the Accused making _unsolicited_ advances and the Complainant _rejecting_ these advances.[^182]

126    Given the inexplicable material omissions and contradictions between the Accused’s testimony in Court and his police statement, I also found that the Accused had concocted nothing more than a fanciful account of events to buttress his narrative that he had been engaged in mutual playful banter of a sexual nature with the Complainant throughout the night, leading to the act in question. I rejected it as nothing more than a desperate bid to reshape the truth.

## The Court’s Decision On The Charge

127    It is against this backdrop that I now turn to assess the parties’ evidence vis-à-vis the act in question.

### The Actus Reus of the Act is Not in Dispute

128    I did not find the Complainant’s inability to recall the specific _actus reus_ of the offence to hamper or compromise the Prosecution’s case since the physical act of the Accused rubbing his exposed penis on the Complainant’s breasts was _unequivocally_ accepted by the Defence.[^183]

129    It was also apparent to me that the Complainant was under no illusion that the Accused was masturbating atop her. Thus, while she was mistaken as to the _manner_ in which he was doing so, her grievance clearly pertained to the Accused masturbating on her without her consent.[^184] There was no ambiguity in this regard and the Defence’s submission to the contrary, rang hollow.

130    Further, in adopting a trauma-informed approach to understanding how observations and memories are encoded, stored and retrieved during times of stress (advocated in _GCK_ at \[110\] – \[113\]), I found it unsurprising and entirely conceivable that the Complainant could not recall every single detail of the act in question given her state of shock; a point I return to at \[140\]. Advances in our understanding of the impact of trauma on the brain show that whilst trauma survivors remember some aspects of their experience in exquisitely painful detail, they remember other aspects not at all, or only in fragments. Such is the nature of traumatic experiences which we cannot ignore.

131    Thus, when I viewed the Complainant’s evidence surrounding the act through a trauma-informed lens, I found no force in the Defence’s submission that the inconsistency between her evidence and the _actus reus_ of the charge severely compromised the Prosecution’s case. This was especially since the Accused did not deny the physical act.

### The Complainant Did Not Consent to the Act

132    Before delving into the Accused’s state of mind at the time of the act, I first address the issue of whether the Complainant consented to the act expressly or implicitly.

#### There was no implicit consent arising from the parties antecedent interactions

133    Based on what had transpired in the course of the night, the Defence submitted that the Accused genuinely believed that the Complainant had consented or would consent to the act in question. However, since I dismissed the Accused’s claim of mutual sexual banter between the parties and concluded that the Accused knew that the Complainant did not consent to his various advances in the hours preceding the act, I found that there was no reasonable or sound basis to infer from the parties’ _prior interactions_, that the Complainant had implicitly consented to the act in question.

134    For completeness, I would add that even _if_ I had found that the Accused truly believed that the Complainant had consented to his _prior advances_, there was in my view, no basis to stretch any perceived _prior consent_ to the act in question since it was a dramatic escalation in sexual explicitness and of a different character altogether. As the Prosecution eloquently stated, “consent is ultimately specific to each act, and not a blank cheque to be cashed heedlessly.”[^185]

#### There was also no express or implicit consent at the time of the act

135    That leaves the issue of whether the Complainant consented expressly or implicitly through her tone and body language at the _time of the act_. This required consideration of the objective circumstances before the Accused at the material time.

##### (1)   The Complainant could not consent to the initiation of the act as she was asleep

136    I considered when the act of masturbation _began_. It is undisputed that when the Accused awoke from his nap, he saw the Complainant lying on the ground some distance away from him, with a sweater covering her face. The Accused admitted to kneeling over the Complainant while she was still asleep, such that her body was between his knees. He then claimed to have touched the Complainant’s left breast to rouse her and rubbed his penis across her breasts once she had awoken and removed the jacket from her face.

137    In contrast, the Complainant testified that she woke-up because she felt a weight on her abdomen and felt a movement. When she removed the sweater from her face, she saw the Accused partially seated on her torso; she testified that this was the weight she had felt. According to the Complainant, the Accused _“was already masturbating”_[^186] when she awoke. She recalled him looking directly at her face and moving his body back and forth in a rocking motion which she described as being _“almost like he was performing coitus”_. She felt something 1 to 2 centimeters away from her face, gauged that it was the Accused’s penis and surmised that he was masturbating atop her. The Prosecution submitted that since the Accused began rubbing his penis on the Complainant’s breasts when she was still asleep, she was incapable of consenting. In the alternative, the Prosecution submitted that even _if_ the Complainant was awake when the Accused began rubbing his penis on her breasts, she was clearly disoriented and in no position to consent.

138    I found myself in agreement with the Prosecution. The Complainant impressed me as an inherently credible, forthcoming witness who provided her evidence with clarity and without hesitation or embellishment. Though she could not recall the _actus reus_ of the charge, this did not, for reasons already canvassed (_supra_ at \[129\] to \[131\]), detract from her overall credibility as a witness. If anything, her candid concession that she could not recall and did not feel the Accused rubbing his penis against her chest,[^187] attested to her candor and bolstered her overall credibility in the eyes of this Court.

139    In my judgment, her demeanor coupled with the quality of her evidence (which was textured and rich in detail), showed the intensity of her experience and bore the ring of truth. Her unmistakably clear evidence of what she saw, notwithstanding her shock and initial disorientation, led me to conclude that the Accused was indeed already in the midst of masturbating on her when she awoke. Given that the _initiation_ of the act occurred while she was asleep, the Complainant was clearly in no position to consent: _Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span> at \[96(c)\].

140    Even _if_ I had given the Accused the benefit of the doubt and accepted his claim that the act began _after_ the Complainant had awakened, I found that the objective facts showed that she was disoriented and in no state to consent to the _initiation_ of the act. In this regard, I noted that the Defence did not challenge the Complainant’s evidence that she was _“really confused”_, _“in a daze”_ and _“needed some time to process what was happening”_ when she first opened her eyes and saw the Accused kneeling over her.[^188] Thus, even taking the Defence’s case at its highest on this issue, it was plain to me that the Complainant was in no state to consent to the _initiation_ of the act given her disorientation upon waking-up.

141    Flowing from this, I also found that the Complainant’s disorientation was palpable to the Accused since his own evidence was that she had no _initial_ reaction (positive or otherwise) to him masturbating atop her after removing her jacket from her face.[^189]

142    Though this is sufficient to dispose of the matter, I nonetheless continue with my analysis of the evidence to determine if the Complainant _subsequently_ consented, expressly or implicitly, to the act.

##### (2)   The Complainant expressly communicated her dissent to the act when she awoke

143    The Complainant explained that after taking some time to process what was happening, she told the Accused, _“get off me.”_ The Accused testified that the Complainant told him to _“stop”_. I did not find this to be a material difference since ultimately, either phrase would, if taken literally, have conveyed the Complainant’s dissent to the act through her direction to the Accused to cease what he was doing atop her. What was material in the present case, was the _tone_ underlying the Complainant’s statement and it was on this issue, that the evidence of the Prosecution and Defence materially diverged. While the Complainant testified that she had looked the Accused in the eye and told him to get off her _“sternly”_, the Accused claimed that she had told him to stop in what he described as a playful and coy tone, said in jest.

144    The Defence’s case hinged on the fact that the Accused did not think that the Complainant was withholding consent because of: (i) the tone she used when she said “stop”, and (ii) their interactions throughout the night.[^190] As I have already addressed and rejected the latter submission, it only remains for me to reiterate the words of the Complainant:[^191]

>   
| 

**After all I have said and done**, said being ‘stop it’, ‘go away’ and done being pushed him away, moved away from him**, I don’t understand why anyone would think that I may give consent**.

 |
| 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

145    I now address the former submission that turns on the tone used by the Complainant at the material time. At trial, the Accused testified:[^192]

>   
| 

the ordinary meaning of the word ‘stop’ is \[for\] someone to pause what they are doing … \[but\] it depends on the context … \[it is\] not necessary \[that\] every time a ‘stop’ means a stop … **when she said the word ‘stop’, I see \[it\] as carry on … the way she said ‘stop’ … it sounds very playful to me** … so to me, the definition of ‘stop’ really doesn’t mean a stop. And, to me, I took it as … ‘carry on’.

 |
| 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

146    I struggled to accept the Accused’s proposition for the following reasons:

> a.     the purportedly playful tone from which the Accused surmised that the Complainant consented to the act, was a _material_ fact that was conspicuously missing from his police statement;

> b.     it was a material fact that also did not arise during the Defence’s lengthy cross-examination of the Complainant, despite her clear evidence that she had spoken to the Accused in a _stern tone_; and

> c.     the Accused’s own evidence on the tone employed by the Complainant tone when she said _“stop”_, is inconsistent and thus suspect. Despite repeatedly claiming that the Complainant had used a playful tone, the Accused was unwilling to demonstrate how that sounded. In fact, when pressed by the Prosecution under cross-examination, the Accused eventually admitted that _“it sounded like … a normal stop”_ and thereafter mechanically resorted to his usual refrain that it was the feeling and atmosphere between the parties at the time, that gave him the impression that she did not mean stop in the literal sense.[^193]

147    The foregoing coalesced to cast significant doubt on the veracity of the Accused’s claim. It was clear that his testimony on this issue was but a fictional afterthought with no basis in reality. I found that it was fabricated by the Accused in a bid to both buttress his narrative that there was a playful mood of mutual intimacy between the parties, as well as dilute the significance of his damning admission in his police statement that the Complainant had in fact told him to stop.[^194]

148    I was in no doubt that the Complainant had expressly and unequivocally communicated her dissent to the Accused’s act when she awoke (a fact I subsequently address at \[155\]).

##### (3)   The Complainant’s conduct underscored her lack of consent to the act

149    I also did not find anything in the Complainant’s behaviour, both at the time of the act and thereafter, to warrant the inference that she had consented.

150    First, to address a point raised by the Defence, there was nothing untoward about the Complainant’s lack of physical resistance during the incident. Tonic immobility is not an uncommon reaction to sexual assault: _GCK_ at \[111\]. In the present case, the Complainant’s immobility during the act was not only understandable, it also should not be viewed in isolation, divorced from her earlier express rejection of the act which the Accused blatantly ignored. The Complainant explained that she was in a state of shock when she realized her words carried no weight with the Accused. It was also undisputed that she continued to lie on the floor without moving for several minutes even _after_ the Accused had ejaculated on her, retrieved some tissue and wiped his semen from her body. In her words, _“I couldn’t move. I was just stuck there.”_[^195] It was thus clear to me that the Complainant was in a state of paralyzing shock after her request for the Accused to cease, fell on deaf ears. To my mind, this in fact underscored her lack of consent to the act.

151    Second, the Complainant’s behaviour in the immediate aftermath of the act, which includes the police report made within _minutes_ of the incident, was entirely consistent with her evidence that she was not a consenting party to the act. In the absence of the Defence proffering _any_ explanation for the _allegedly_ drastic change in the Complainant’s demeanor (from being playful and coy moments earlier to pure indignation), I found that her palpable anger and distress could only be explained by the fact that she simply did not consent to the Accused masturbating atop her.

152    All things considered, I accepted the Complainant’s unfaltering evidence that she did not consent to the act and had expressly conveyed her dissent by telling the Accused in no uncertain terms, to stop or get off her in a stern tone. I can do no better than restate the Complainant’s evidence on this issue:[^196]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Did you consent to the accused’s act?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Well, um, firstly, **I was asleep, so I did not consent or invite him to**, uh, **kneel over my body because I was asleep** and, um, **I also verbally tell him to get off me, so that is exactly the opposite of consent.** And furthermore, he had never asked in the entire course of the night for my permission to do anything.

 |
| 

 | 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

153    It is apposite to highlight at this juncture, that I did not find the ‘unusually convincing’ standard applicable in the present case, since the Complainant’s evidence (_viz._ that she told the Accused to stop masturbating atop her) was corroborated by the Accused himself. Nonetheless, for completeness, to my mind, her account was ‘unusually convincing’.

### The Accused Knew that the Complainant Did Not Consent to the Act

154    I now turn to the key issue that confronted this Court - whether the Accused _knew_ that the Complainant did not consent to his act and thus acted with the intention of outraging her modesty. Again, I turn to consider the objective circumstances before the Accused as these would shed light on his knowledge at the time of the commission of the act.

#### The Accused understood the Complainant’s clear words of rejection

155    I found that the Accused _knew_ from the literal meaning of the Complainant’s words, that she was clearly and unequivocally rejecting his masturbation atop her. Quite apart from my assessment at \[144\] to \[148\], I am fortified in this view by the fact that the Accused responded to the Complainant’s statement by telling her _“a while more”_. As highlighted by the Prosecution, if the Accused had genuinely understood “stop” to mean “carry on”, there would have been no reason for him to tell the Complainant _“a while more”_, since he already had license to continue. Instead, I found that the Accused responded in the manner that he did, precisely because he knew that the Complainant wanted him to desist and he was peremptorily informing her that he nonetheless intended to continue for a while more. All considered, I thus rejected the Accused’s incredible assertion that he believed “stop” to mean, “carry on”.

#### The Accused harboured no belief that the Complainant consented to the act

156    I must stress that in any sexual interaction, consent is always specific to the act performed and specific to the parties involved. In this regard, further undermining the Accused’s claim at trial that he believed the Complainant consented to his act and wanted him to carry on, was the following admission in his police statement:[^197]

>   
| 

**my past experience with other girls**, were similar and they were okay with it … I **thought that \[Complainant\] will be ok** with that.

 |
| 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

It was telling that contrary to his protestations at trial, the Accused’s admission in his police statement revealed that he had merely _assumed_ that the Complainant would be ok with his act based on his previous experience with _other girls_, and not because he truly believed, based on anything the Complainant _herself_ had said and/or done up to the material time, that she was indeed a consenting party.

157    In this regard, the Accused’s failure to mention that he had performed the act believing that the Complainant had consented to it based on anything she _herself_ had said and/or done (a fact _so material_ to the Defence’s case), despite being categorically asked _why_ he had rubbed his penis against her chest, further entrenched my finding that he in fact harbored no such belief at the material time. The Defence’s attempt to gloss over this material omission with the general assertion that the Accused had told the IO whatever he could remember, was woefully inadequate.

158    I found the Accused’s admission in his statement that he _“just want\[ed\] to release”_ in _“a moment of lust”_ and that he was _“purely thinking with \[his\] private part”_,[^198] telling of his true motivations for committing the act. It evinced his intention to unabashedly satisfy his sexual desires without any regard for the Complainant’s express rejection of the same. The Accused’s blatant disregard for the Complainant’s modesty also explains why he persisted with the act until he ejaculated on her (a fact I address at \[161\]).

159    Finally, it was disingenuous for the Defence to submit that the Complainant’s failure to physically retaliate or say anything apart from ‘stop’, reinforced the Accused’s perception that she was consenting. Lying still cannot be equated with consent especially since I have found that the Accused was aware that the Complainant wanted him to desist. In any event, the Accused conceded that _at the time of the act_, he was not actually waiting to see if the Complainant would react in any way to his act, physically or otherwise.[^199] As this was not even within his contemplation at the material time, I found no basis to ascribe any weight to his belated claim that the Complainant’s conduct reinforced his perception that she was consenting.[^200]

160    On the totality of the evidence presented to me, I thus rejected the Accused’s assertion that he believed the Complainant had consented to his act. It was clear to me that the Accused was under no illusion whatsoever, that the Complainant was not a willing party.

### The Accused Intended to Ejaculate on the Complainant

161    While the Defence contended that the Accused’s ejaculation on the Complainant was accidental, I found otherwise. Under cross-examination, the Accused admitted that he had rubbed his penis across the Complainant’s breasts with the sole objective of ejaculating.[^201] While he initially insisted that his semen had only landed on the Complainant’s shoulder, he eventually conceded to having wiped his semen from the Complainant’s face.[^202] Upon so conceding, he then claimed that he had not been aiming to ejaculate on the Complainant’s face but had inadvertently ejaculated on her whilst in the process of trying to stand-up.[^203]

162    I deal first with the issue of _where_ the Accused had ejaculated. I noted the admission in the ASOF (Exhibit P1) which categorically states that tissue the Accused had used to wipe the Complainant’s _right neck, face and hair_ was analyzed and found to contain his semen (_supra_ at \[4a\]). Pertinently, there is no mention of the Accused having wiped his semen from the Complainant’s _shoulder_. As a matter of simple logic, there would have been no need for the Accused to have wiped the Complainant’s right neck, face and hair if his semen was not there. That he did so, coupled with the fact that his semen was subsequently found on the tissues used, led to the inexorable conclusion that the Accused had indeed, as the Complainant testified unchallenged, ejaculated on her right neck, face (near her chin and ear) and hair.[^204]

163    Next, is the issue of whether the Accused had intended to ejaculate on the Complainant. I dismissed the Accused’s claim that he had been in the process of standing-up when he inadvertently ejaculated on the Complainant, observing that this account had never been put to her and only arose during the Defence case.

164    Considering the evidence as a whole, it was apparent to me that the Accused, contrary to his protestations, had no qualms ejaculating on the Complainant. In this regard, it was pertinent to note that ejaculation in the present case was neither spontaneous nor instantaneous and occurred only after a sustained period of the Accused rubbing his penis across the Complainant’s breasts. It was clear to me that if the Accused had _truly_ wanted to ejaculate on the ground as he claimed, he had _ample_ opportunity to do so. He could have stood-up earlier and walked away from the Complainant prior to ejaculating; a fact he accepted under cross-examination.[^205] Yet, he chose not to do so.

165    Bearing in mind that the Accused would have known, physiologically, that he was on the cusp of ejaculating, he could have resorted to various measures to avoid doing so on the Complainant if that was truly his intent. For instance, the Accused could have easily redirected, repositioned or used his hands to shield his appendage as he felt himself about to ejaculate. He did neither. Instead, he proceeded to ejaculate on the Complainant whilst looking squarely at her. To my mind, this could only mean that the Accused did not intend to ejaculate elsewhere; in keeping with his blatant indifference to the Complainant’s modesty.

### The Complainant had No Motive to Fabricate

166    I round off my assessment by examining if the Complainant would have any motive to lie about what transpired with the Accused. The law requires the Defence to adduce sufficient evidence of motive; one that raises a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case, before the burden shifts to the Prosecution to prove that there was no such motive: _Goh Han Heng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 4 SLR(R) 374</span> at \[33\]; _Public Prosecutor v Roger Yue Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 125</span> at \[48\].

167    Applying this principle to the facts in the present case, as the Defence did not raise evidence of any motive on the part of the Complainant to make false allegations against the Accused, the burden on the Prosecution to disprove such motive did not arise. While the Defence alluded to the Complainant’s comment on social media that she was a good liar, it refrained from contending that this showed a motive to fabricate evidence against the Accused.[^206] This was wise since the Complainant had merely been responding to a question posed to her (_“r u a good liar”_) by an anonymous individual who, from the response that followed (_“probs why u lied abt ur police case and “alleged” molest LMAO”_), was clearly aware of the present case and was intent on goading her.[^207] While the Accused admitted to taking screenshots of the Complainant’s responses, he disclaimed responsibility for the questions posed to her.[^208]

168    Ultimately, there was no evidence before me to suggest that the Complainant had _any_ reason to falsely implicate the Accused. I also did not find the Complainant’s response on social media to a question posed by an anonymous individual (who clearly bore an agenda), to undermine her credibility or detract from my finding that she had provided her evidence in a candid and forthright manner without embellishment (_supra_ at \[138\] and \[152\]).

### The Finding of Guilt

169    In the final analysis, after a granular assessment of the evidence put forth by the Prosecution and the Defence, I dismissed the Accused’s claim of mutual sexual banter between the parties and concluded that he knew that the Complainant did not consent to his various advances in the hours preceding the act. I thus found that there was no reasonable or sound basis to infer from the parties’ _prior interactions_, that the Complainant had implicitly consented to the act.

170    I also found that the Complainant did not expressly or implicitly consent to the act _at the time_ of the offence. This was grounded in the fact that she was asleep when the act began and thus in no position to consent, and subsequently expressly told the Accused to stop when she awoke. Finally, I found that the Accused knew, from the Complainant’s clear words of rejection during the act itself, that she was not a consenting party. His persistence despite such knowledge, led to the irresistible inference that he intended to outrage her modesty simply to satiate his lustful desires.

171    Drawing the strands together, I was satisfied that the Accused’s guilt had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and thus convicted him accordingly.

## Sentencing

172    The framework in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”) guides sentencing for offences under section 354(1) of the Penal Code and invites the Court to adopt the following two-step sentencing band approach (at \[46\] – \[49\]):

>   
| 

(a) First, the court should identify under which band the offence in question falls within, having regard to the factors which relate to the manner and mode by which the _offence_ was committed as well as the harm caused to the victim (we shall refer to these as ‘offence-specific’ factors). Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may _usually_ be imposed for a case with those offence-specific features, has been identified the court should then determine precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an ‘indicative starting point’, which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the _offending act_.

(b) Secondly, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which _are personal to the offender_ to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender. These ‘offender-specific’ factors relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, _cannot_ be the factors which have already been taken into account in the categorization of the offence. In exceptional circumstances, the court is entitled to move outside of the prescribed range for that band if, in its view, the case warrants such a departure.

 |
| 

(emphasis in original)

 |

  
  

173    Referencing _GBR v Public Prosecutor_ \[2017\] SGC 296 (“_GBR”_), the following were identified as relevant offence-specific factors:[^209]

>   
| 

(i) The degree of sexual exploitation. This includes considerations of the **part** of the victim’s body the accused **touched**, **how** the accused **touched** the victim, and the **duration** of the outrage of modesty.

(ii) The circumstances of the offence. These include considerations of: (A) the presence of premeditation; (B) the **use of force** or violence; (C) the abuse of a position of trust; (D) the use of deception; (E) the **presence of other aggravating acts** accompanying the outrage of modesty; and (F) the **exploitation of a vulnerable victim**.

(iii) The **harm caused to the victim**, whether physical or psychological, which would usually be set out in a victim impact statement.

 |
| 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

174    The prescribed characteristics of each band were distilled at \[45\](b):

>   
| 

a) Band 1: This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts.

b) Band 2: This includes cases where **two or more of the offence-specific factors** present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception.

c) Band 3: This includes cases where numerous offence specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.

### The Prosecution’s Position

175    Applying the _Kunasekaran_ framework, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was appropriate.[^210] In support of its submission that the offence fell in the middle of Band 2, the Prosecution highlighted three offence-specific factors _viz._ the high degree of sexual exploitation, the exploitation of the Complainant whilst in a vulnerable state and the intentional ejaculation on the Complainant’s face. The Prosecution also asserted that there was some element of restraint as the Accused had rested his body weight on the Complainant, leaving her unable to resist him physically. As there were no offence-specific mitigating factors, the Prosecution submitted that no further calibration of the sentence was warranted.[^211]

176    The Prosecution further submitted that a non-custodial sentence was inappropriate as the Accused was above 21 years of age at the time of the offence and therefore, the rehabilitative presumption in favour of young offenders did not apply to him. In any event, it was argued that the Accused did not manifest any reformative propensity nor were there exceptional circumstances warranting a rehabilitative sentencing approach.[^212]

### The Defence’s Position

177    The Defence agreed that the Kunasekaran framework applied. While there was consensus that the Accused’s offending fell within Band 2, the Defence contended that it lay at the lowest end of Band 2, thus warranting a sentence of no more than 6 months’ imprisonment.[^213] In this regard, it was submitted that:

> a.     the degree of sexual exploitation was at the lowest end of Band 2: there was no evidence of contact with the Complainant’s breasts, no skin-to-skin contact, the duration of the act was not prolonged and the Complainant was not pinned down or restrained;[^214] and

> b.     the circumstances of the offence were not particularly serious: there was no premeditation, no violence or aggression, no abuse of a position of trust, no abuse of trust in an inter-familial context, no aggravating act accompanying the commission of the offence, no physical harm and any psychological harm to the Complainant was minimal.[^215]

178    In mitigation, the Defence also highlighted that the Accused was untraced, had an unblemished record and was a promising young man who had displayed exemplary conduct in school. It was submitted that the present incident was an isolated one committed out of character and would never be repeated. The Court was also urged to accord mitigating weight to extenuating personal circumstances that have arisen as a consequence of the criminal case against the Accused and the adverse consequences that are likely to flow from his conviction.[^216]

179    As an alternative to a custodial sentence, the Defence urged the Court to place the Accused on probation as he had rehabilitative capacity and potential. By voluntarily undergoing counselling, resolving to continue with his studies, being mindful of his actions within the school community, continuing with volunteer efforts and not fleeing from the scene of the offence, the Accused had demonstrated a positive desire to change. Strong familial support with increased parental supervision and control were cited as factors conducive to the Accused’s rehabilitation. There were also no risk factors present. In light of the aforesaid, the Defence submitted that the Accused was a suitable candidate for probation.[^217]

### The Appropriate Custodial Sentence

180    I address the Defence’s submission for probation at \[212\] to \[224\], but state at the outset that I did not find a non-custodial sentence appropriate on the present facts. On this basis, I declined to call for a probation suitability report.

181    In calibrating an appropriate sentence, I was guided by the framework in _Kunasekaran_, and began by considering the relevant offence-specific factors.

#### Offence-specific factors

##### (1)   The degree of sexual exploitation was high

182    First, there was a clear intrusion upon the Complainant’s private parts. Contrary to the Defence’s curious submission that there was no evidence of any contact with the Complainant’s private parts, was the Accused’s own evidence that he had rubbed the entire length of his exposed penis in a to and fro motion over the Complainant’s clothed _breasts_.[^218]

183    Second, the manner of touching was highly intrusive. While there was no skin-to-skin contact with the Complainant’s breasts, I was mindful that this was not an archetypal case of molest involving contact between an offender’s hand and a victim’s exposed private parts. The contact here was between the Accused’s genitals – his _bare penis_ – and the Complainant’s clothed breasts. The degree to which the touch occurred, was also relevant. This was a clear case of frotteurism as the Accused _actively rubbed_ his penis over the Complainant’s breasts. There was no denying the egregious intrusiveness of the act.

184    Third, the touch was more than fleeting. The Defence contended that the duration of the act was not prolonged. I disagree. This was not a touch that ceased after a single instance of contact. While the Accused could not ascribe a precise time to his act, by his own admission, he had rubbed his penis over the Complainant’s breasts for a total of up to 25 seconds until he achieved ejaculation.[^219] By the Complainant’s estimation, the act lasted for _at least_ 9 seconds;[^220] though I was particularly mindful that this timeframe only accounted for a fragment of the offence during which she was awake and did not account for the preceding portion of the offence which began when she was asleep. It sufficed to say that the offending act was not brief, neither quick nor momentary, and was instead a not insignificant period of sustained violation.

##### (2)   The Accused exploited the vulnerability of a sleeping victim

185    Next, I turn to consider the circumstances of the offence. In convicting the Accused, I had found that he began masturbating atop the Complainant while she was still asleep and thus in no position to consent. The Accused’s exploitation of his sleeping victim’s vulnerability was a factor compounding the seriousness of the offence.[^221]

##### (3)   The Accused persisted in the act

186    There was also added aggravation accruing from the Accused’s wilful persistence in continuing with his molestation of the Complainant despite her express and vocal entreaty for him to desist when she awoke. His brazen and lewd pursuit of his own sexual gratification was not only serious, it completely eclipsed any consideration of the Complainant. This heightened the audaciousness of his act.

##### (4)   The Complainant was in a position of forced submission

187    I was also mindful that whilst no violence or aggression was used in the commission of the offence, the Complainant was effectively placed in a position of forced submission on the ground when the Accused sat on her abdomen and rubbed his penis over her breasts. In this regard, it would be recalled that the Complainant had testified that she was _“pinned down”_ by the Accused’s weight.[^222] In the course of his evidence, the Accused himself accepted that some of his body weight was resting on the Complainant.[^223]

188    Thus, while I accepted that the Accused did not restrain the Complainant in the usual sense of the word (in that he did not use his hands to hold down her limbs during the act), it was important to consider the unique circumstances of the present offence. In this regard, I noted that by the Accused bringing his body weight to bear down upon the Complainant, whether in whole or in part, she would have had to exert _some measure_ of force to extricate herself from beneath him. I was acutely aware that this was not a situation where the Complainant could simply have walked away after brushing the Accused’s offending appendage off her. Thus, to the extent that the Accused’s sitting atop the Complainant hampered and compromised her ability to quickly and easily disengage herself from the molestation, I found that she was restrained and accorded some weight to this.

##### (5)   The Accused ejaculated on the Complainant’s face and neck

189    In considering the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty, the final indignity of the Accused ejaculating on the Complainant becomes relevant. In my judgment, it served to heighten the already degrading and demeaning nature of the offence.

##### (6)   There is evidence of some psychological harm

190    Next, I considered if the Complainant had suffered any harm as a result of the offence. I accept that no physical harm was inflicted. However, in the course of the trial, there arose _some_ evidence that afforded this Court a glimpse into the emotional and psychological toll of the offence on the Complainant. I noted the Complainant’s testimony that she felt _“like a slut and a whore”_[^224] because she had been _“used”_, _“disrespected and degraded”_.[^225] She also testified that she could not sleep for a few days after the offence as she kept replaying the incident in her mind. It was also the Complainant’s unchallenged evidence that she was diagnosed with acute stress disorder after the incident and that she was prescribed Xanax to alleviate her anxiety over the impending court hearing.[^226]

191    While there was no other evidence before this Court as to the _extent_ of the injuries to the Complainant’s psyche (which thus precluded a finding of moderate or severe harm), it would have been remiss of me to ignore or reject, entirely, her otherwise _unchallenged_ evidence on this issue simply because no reports had been tendered; especially since I found her to be a credible witness who had testified in a manner that was forthright and without embellishment. Nonetheless, in the absence of sufficient information as to the _extent_ of the emotional and psychological trauma the Complainant had suffered as a consequence of this incident, I was careful not to place substantial weight on this aspect of her evidence at the sentencing stage.

##### (7)   An indicative starting point of 10 months’ imprisonment is appropriate

192    Based on the aforesaid offence-specific factors, it was plain that the appropriate starting point could not be the minimum sentencing point in Band 2, as suggested by the Defence. Furthermore, the Defence’s submission that the present case fell at the lowest end of Band 2 given the absence of several aggravating factors (such as the abuse of trust, premeditation and violence), was wholly misplaced as the non-existence of an aggravating factor cannot be construed as a mitigating factor which an offender should be given credit for.

193    After a holistic assessment of the factors at the first stage, I determined that the case fell squarely in the middle of Band 2 with a starting point of 10 months’ imprisonment.

#### Offender-specific factors

194    I then considered if there were any offender-specific factors that warranted further calibration of the indicative sentence.

195    The fact that the Accused was a first-offender was a neutral factor as it was not positive evidence of good character. There was no mitigating value to be attributed to the absence of antecedents since this was merely the absence of an aggravating factor.[^227] As for the Defence’s submission that this was an isolated aberration committed out of character, it was relevant only to the extent that I did not find it necessary to impose a heavier punishment in order to specifically deter the Accused from re-offending: _Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> (_“Stansilas”_) at \[99\].

196    Next, I also considered the Accused’s decision to claim trial to be a neutral factor. While it was his right to do so, he was not entitled to any sentencing discount that he would otherwise have been entitled to had he pleaded guilty.[^228]

197    Finally, I did not consider the adverse personal consequences that would follow as a result of the Accused’s conviction, including doubts over his ability to graduate from tertiary education, to be a relevant mitigating factor. While the consequences for the Accused will no doubt transcend these Court proceedings, such collateral consequences are not relevant to sentencing. Quite simply, barring exceptional circumstances (which did not feature here), a person who breaches the criminal law must expect to face the consequences that follow under the law: _Stanslias_ at \[110\] – \[111\]; _M Raveendran v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 254</span> at \[13\], \[32\], \[38\] and \[47\].

#### The sentence imposed

198    Having undertaken a holistic assessment of the factors in the present case, I found no reason to disturb the indicative sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment. In addition, I also imposed 3 strokes of the cane to adequately reflect the need for deterrence and retribution that was clearly warranted on the facts. This would also accord with the practice that caning ought to be imposed where a victim’s private parts and sexual organs are intruded upon: _Public Prosecutor v Chow Yee Sze_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 481</span> at \[9\]; cited with approval in _GBR_ at \[31\] and _Kunasekaran_ at \[50\].

#### Precedent cases

199    I turn briefly, to address the precedents that were brought to my attention.

200    Of the precedents cited, _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span> (_“GCO”_) is salient as it involved an almost analogous situation where there was an intrusion into the clothed private part of a sleeping victim. The offender had pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, molesting the victim by touching her “vagina area” beneath her shorts but over her underwear while she was asleep. On appeal, the High Court found that there was a high degree of sexual exploitation as the facts involved an intrusion into the victim’s private parts whilst she was asleep and vulnerable. The Court applied the _Kunasekaran_ framework and held that the presence of these factors brought the case within Band 2, albeit not the upper end of Band 2 given the absence of skin-to-skin contact and the absence of any further aggravating factors.[^229] Though there was an escalation in offending (as the offender had committed a prior offence under s 509 of the Penal Code for which he was also sentenced at the same hearing), the Court considered that it was effectively negated by the offender’s early plea of guilt and unreserved apology to the victim which evinced genuine remorse. Whilst the custodial sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment was upheld on appeal, the High Court set aside the first instance sentence of caning, observing thus (at \[94\]):

>   
| 

In my view, caning ought not to be imposed in this case. **Caning has typically been imposed** on offenders in cases applying the Kunasekaran framework where there was skin-to-skin contact, or the **contact was prolonged**, or there was an **element of restraint** applied to the victim, although **these aggravating factors should not be taken to be exhaustive**. **None of these three factors is present here** … **There is nothing to suggest that the appellant sought deliberately to prolong the contact, or that he persisted after the second victim woke up.** Nor is there any suggestion of abuse of trust …

 |
| 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

201    In my assessment, _GCO_ stands as appellate authority that _minimally_, a tariff of eight months’ imprisonment extends to cases which feature the offence-specific factors of intrusion over the clothed private part of a sleeping victim.

202    However, in contrast to _GCO_, the present case involves a far higher degree of sexual exploitation in terms of nature, duration and intensity. While there was a single instance of contact between the offender’s hand and the victim’s clothed vagina area in _GCO_, in the present case there was sustained contact between the Accused’s bare penis and the Complainant’s clothed breasts.

203    Further, while both cases involved the molestation of a sleeping and hence vulnerable victim, the offender in _GCO_ ceased his molestation of the victim immediately upon her waking up. In fact, in setting aside the first instance sentence of caning, the High Court expressly found, _inter alia_, that there was nothing to suggest that the offender had deliberately sought to prolong the contact or that he had persisted after the victim woke-up. In stark contrast, the Accused brazenly and audaciously persisted with the act of molestation even after the Complainant awoke and told him to desist. For these reasons, the Accused’s culpability is more amplified than the offender in _GCO_ and warranting of not just a longer custodial term, but also the imposition of caning.

204    In _Public Prosecutor v Thomson Matthew_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1108</span> (_“Thomson Matthew”_), a case cited by the Defence, the offender was convicted after trial on two charges of molesting a flight stewardess onboard a commercial flight. The Prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed for the first charge which involved the offender using his hand to touch the victim at her hip and over her stomach until her lower breast in one motion. On appeal, the High Court held that once the victim’s psychological harm and the aggravating factor of the offence being committed against an air transportation worker were properly accounted for, the appropriate starting point would be eight months’ imprisonment, notwithstanding the lower degree of sexual exploitation.[^230]

205    The aforesaid offence-specific aggravating factors are counterbalanced in the present case by the Accused’s exploitation of a vulnerable sleeping victim and his obdurate persistence with the offending act in spite of the Complainant’s plea for him to cease. However, in juxtaposition to the lower degree of sexual exploitation in _Thomsom Matthew_, the palpably more intrusive nature of the Accused’s sexual exploitation of the Complainant coupled with the element of restraint and the act of ejaculation on her, demanded a concomitantly higher custodial sentence and the imposition of caning.

206    Next, I considered the case of _Kunasekaran_, where the offender was convicted after trial for touching his 14-year-old victim’s “groin area” over her school uniform, with his fingers. The offence occurred onboard a public bus. At first instance, the offender was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment, and, although being above the age of 50, he was ineligible for caning, no additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning was imposed. The sentence was upheld on appeal even though the High Court found that the offender had intruded into the victim’s groin area (as opposed to her vagina).

207    The affirmation on appeal of the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the act of molestation performed over clothing, reinforces the point that intrusions to private parts (even if merely the groin area) are regarded with especial gravity in sentencing, whether they are committed over or under the victim’s garments.

208    I noted some similarity between the two cases as the offences were committed against vulnerable victims in both cases; a 14-year-old girl in _Kunasekaran_ and a sleeping woman in the present case. While the offence-specific factors such as the commission of the offence on public transport and psychological harm to the victim in _Kunasekaran_ were counterbalanced by other offence-specific factors (such as persistence in offending, ejaculation on the Complainant and some evidence of psychological harm) in the present case, it was patent yet again, that the higher degree of sexual exploitation in this case necessitated a correspondingly higher sentence.

209    As for caning, I was mindful that the issue was considered in _Kunasekaran_ in the context of the High Court determining if there were grounds to exercise its discretion to impose a term of imprisonment in lieu of caning as the offender, who was above 50 years of age, was statutorily ineligible for caning. After considering the aggravating factors, the High Court held that “the sentencing considerations that _displace_ the starting position that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced just because he is exempted from caning are not present.” It was clear, as the Prosecution submitted, that the calculus in _Kunasekaran_ was different as the offender was ineligible for caning and the High Court’s consideration was thus confined to an assessment of whether it was an appropriate case to displace the principle that imprisonment should not be enhanced unless there are grounds to do so[^231] and impose an additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning.

210    Thus viewed, the decision not to impose imprisonment in lieu of caning in _Kunasekaran_, did not constrain or otherwise impinge upon my assessment that caning was appropriate on the facts of the present case.

211    In the final analysis, I do not find the sentence imposed on the Accused to be inconsistent with the precedents cited by either party. Ultimately, there is great variance in the manner in which an offence of outrage of modesty can present itself and each case presents with different offence-specific factors. Sentencing in the end, is fact-specific. Thus, while other cases may provide some guidance, the more principled methodology for arriving at the appropriate sentence, is to apply the _Kunasekaran_ framework and consider where the present case falls. This is what I have done.

### Probation is Not Suitable

212    I now explain why probation is not a suitable sentence in the present case.

#### The need for deterrent sentencing in offences of outrage of modesty

213    Our Courts have long recognized that general deterrence is the paramount sentencing consideration in sexual offences; outrage of modesty offences included. Prevailing policy considerations also underscore the pressing need for deterrent sentences in offences of this genre. This was most recently enunciated by Minister for Law and Home Affairs, Mr K Shanmugam, who stressed that the government had decided as a matter of policy, that proportionate punishment and deterrence must take precedence over rehabilitation where an adult offender commits sexual offences: _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (5 March 2021) vol 95 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law and Home Affairs) (“Ministerial Statement on Sexual Offences”).

214    The need for deterrent sentencing is also underscored by the increase in outrage of modesty cases in recent years. On average, from 2016 to 2020, 1190 cases of molest were reported each year. This is 24% higher than the previous period from 2011 to 2015[^232] and signals a clear and mounting need for robust deterrent sentences to stem the commission of such offences; a fact the government has expressly acknowledged in recent times.

215    Further, compelling public policy considerations aside, in my view, the offence-specific factors outlined earlier, heightened the need for a deterrent sentence in the present case. The Defence submitted that deterrence was not the dominant sentencing consideration because the offence here was not committed on public transport and there was no abuse of trust.[^233] Such a submission conveniently ignored the numerous other offence-specific factors of significance that featured in this case.

#### The Accused has not demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform and rehabilitation has not come to the fore

216    Next, I considered if deterrence retained its primacy as the dominant sentencing principle. Given that the Accused was above the age of 21 both at the time of the offence and at sentencing, deterrence would only be displaced by rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration if he was able to demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform or if there were exceptional circumstances. As the Defence rested its arguments on the former ground only, the central issue before me was whether the Accused had demonstrated an _extremely_ strong propensity for reform.

217    I first assessed his desire to change. In _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 82</span> (at \[56\]), Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon distilled several factors that can indicate a positive desire to change. This includes (but is not limited to) evidence of genuine remorse and the offender taking active steps post-offence to leave his errant ways behind. In the present case, the Defence contended that the Accused’s proactive approach to seeking treatment, counselling and therapy with a psychologist, reflected a positive desire for rehabilitation. The Defence also highlighted the fact that the Accused did not attempt to flee the scene and cooperated with the police by admitting to the _actus reus_ of the offence. I presume the latter was submitted as evidence in support of the broader contention that the Accused was in some way, taking charge of his own reform.

218    To these submissions, I make two observations. Foremost, the Accused had steadfastly maintained that he had done nothing wrong. This remains his position to date. His denial of culpability betrayed either an absence of remorse (at its highest) or a lack of insight into the wrongfulness of his actions (at its lowest) and would not at all be suggestive of a personal resolve to reform. The Accused’s purported empathy for members of his school community and his volunteer outreach efforts, which were alluded to in his Mitigation Plea, were also inconsequential given his continuing failure to demonstrate an iota of empathy for the Complainant.

219    Second, as there was a dearth of information before this Court as to the nature of the Accused’s consultations with the psychologist, the _substance_ of these therapy sessions could not be discerned. All that may be gleaned from the memo prepared by the Accused’s psychologist, is that he _“presented with anxiety as he was undergoing police investigations for an alleged offence.”_[^234] In the absence of any other information, it would be reasonable to surmise that the Accused’s therapy sessions were mainly targeted at addressing his anxiety relating to the case against him, rather than to address the root causes of his offending behaviour.

220    This cohered with the fact that the Accused’s resumption of his counselling sessions appeared to coincide with the commencement of the trial. I noted that after a hiatus of approximately 14 months, the Accused saw a psychologist on 21 August 2020, which was less than 3 weeks before the trial commenced. His subsequent appointments in March 2021 coincided with the second tranche of this trial which was heard in April 2021.[^235] These sessions, if targeted at addressing the Accused’s anxiety over the impending trial, would not be especially suggestive of a personal commitment to reform. Even _if_ the sessions addressed the root cause of his offending behaviour, their efficacy remains questionable since the Accused continues to deny the offence to date.

221    I turn to the second limb. The key inquiry here is whether the Accused’s environment presents conditions that are conducive in helping him turn over a new leaf. Without seeking to discount the well-meaning intentions of the Accused’s family, the degree of family support alluded to by the Defence was unexceptional. If I had been satisfied that there was strong _personal_ resolve on the Accused’s part to take accountability for his actions and change himself for the better, then the support of his parents in driving such change _might_ have been accorded more weight. However, for reasons already canvassed, I was not satisfied that the Accused had taken sufficient steps to demonstrate a positive desire and commitment to reform himself. Under such circumstances, it was difficult to see how familial support, in and of itself, would change the analysis.

222    As for the submission that probation would allow the Accused to be positively engaged in both tertiary education and outreach efforts and assist in his rehabilitation, I was mindful that these outlets were not new and were already present in his life when he committed the offence.

223    I deal with the third limb succinctly, with the observation that the Accused’s wilful denial of the offence or lack of insight into his offending is a risk factor of significance that led me to conclude that the best means of securing his rehabilitation was ultimately a deterrent sentence.

224    Flowing from the foregoing analysis, I was unable to conclude even provisionally, that the Accused had demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform such that rehabilitation came to the fore. Probation which places rehabilitation at the front and center of the Court’s deliberation, was therefore simply not an appropriate sentencing option.

## Concluding Remarks

225    Sexual offences of any kind are a gross violation of our fundamental values as a society and offenders should expect to face the full force of the law. I have no doubt that the Accused’s encounter with the criminal justice system will remain firmly etched in his mind. He will also have to bear the collateral consequences of his actions which will extend far beyond these proceedings. However, these are the natural consequences that flow from his bad choices.

226    While reform is possible, I believe the Accused’s path to rehabilitation will truly begin when he takes responsibility for his actions on the morning of 8 January 2019.
