### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

1       All foreigners entering Singapore on a visit entry permit are not allowed to engage in any business, profession or paid employment activities. All foreigners who intend to work in Singapore must have a valid work pass issued by the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) _before_ the commencement of their employment[^1]. Those who intend to engage foreigners as foreign employees in Singapore must similarly obtain a suitable and valid work passes[^2] before employing them.

2       To regulate the recruitment and the use of the foreign manpower in Singapore, the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) has prescribed that all foreigners in Singapore, whether they are professionals, skilled or semi-skilled workers, trainees or students undergoing practical training for up to six months must possess the relevant and valid passes before they can start work in Singapore. The relevant information on the relevant types of work passes, the eligibility criteria and mode of application for these passes are available at the MOM website at _mom.gov.sg_.

3       Section 22(1)(d) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev. Ed.)(“EFMA”) makes it an offence in connection with any application for a work pass or the renewal of a work pass to make a false statement or to furnish information that the applicant knows or reasonably ought to know is false to the Controller of Work Passes, an authorized officer or an employment officer on any material particulars. This offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or to both under section 22(1)(ii) EFMA.

#### The Charges

4       The present case involved a false declaration made to the Controller of Work Passes in an application for a work pass for a foreign employee as a Performing Artiste by a director of Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd. The matter had proceeded as a joint trial pursuant to section 143 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.) and involved the following accused persons:

> a.     Mr Heng Meng Yaw @Wang Jiehou (“**Heng**”), a 46-year old male Singapore citizen who is a director of Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd and

> b.     Ms Liang Hanbing (“**Liang**”), a 38-year old female Chinese national who was the foreign employee in the application.

As a director of Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd, Heng faced one charge under section 22(1)(d) read with section 20(1)(a) EFMA (_Exhibit C1B_). Liang, the foreign employee named in the application form faced one charge under section 22(1)(d) EFMA (_Exhibit C2_). Both Heng and Liang were unrepresented during the trial and had conducted their defences while acting in person. The proceeded charges against Heng and Liang are as follows:

> **_MAC 901452-2019 -_** _Exhibit 1B_

> “…are charged that, on or about 12 January 2018, in Singapore, one Baby Karaoke Club Pte. Ltd…(“company”) of 23 Kampong Bahru Road #01-01 Dimensions Building Singapore 169349, a body corporate of which you were a Director, in connection with an application of a work pass for one Liang Hanbing … (“foreign employee”) to be employed by the company as a Performing Artiste, did make a statement to the Controller of Work Passes, via Work Permit Online (“WPOL”), which was false in a material particular, in an “Application for a Work Permit ” (“form”) submitted to the Work Pass Division, Ministry of Manpower, which offence was committed with your consent; to wit, you, in your capacity as the Director of the said company, declared in the said form that the said foreign employee would be employed by the company as a Performing Artiste, which information you knew was false as there was no intention to employ the said foreign employee at the company as a Performing Artiste, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22(1)(d) read with section 20(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A), punishable under section 22(1)(ii) of the same Act.

> **_MAC 901456-2019_** _\- Exhibit C2_

> “…are charged that you, on or about 12 January 2018, did make a statement to the Controller of Work Passes, Work Pass Division, Ministry of Manpower, via Work Permit Online (“WPOL”), which you knew was false in a material particular in an “Application for a Work Permit” form, in connection with an application for a work permit for you to be employed by one Baby Karaoke Club Pte. Ltd…as a Performing Artiste, to wit, you signed on the said form declaring that the information that you would be employed by the company as a Performing Artiste was true and correct, when you knew this was false, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22(1)(d) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, Chapter 91A, punishable under section 22(1)(ii) of the same Act.”

5       At the conclusion of the trial and after a careful consideration of the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on the respective proceeded charge against both accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt. I found both Heng and Liang guilty and convicted them on their respective charge in **MAC 901456-2019** and **MAC 901452-2019.** After a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence as well as both the accused persons’ oral plea in mitigation, I imposed a sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment on Heng and a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment on Liang.

6       Dissatisfied with my decision, both the accused persons have filed Notices of Appeal against their respective convictions and sentences. Both Heng and Liang are currently on bail pending the hearing of their appeals.

7       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

#### The Trial

8       During the trial, the Prosecution had called two witnesses to the stand to give evidence against Heng and Liang. They were:

## B.   Undisputed Facts

10     In the present case, as the facts relating to the application for the work pass were not in dispute, they are set out below:

> a)     At all material times, Heng was the only active director of the Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd;

> b)     On 13 December 2017, an online application was submitted to the Work Pass Division of MOM to apply for a work permit for Liang to work for the Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste. A performing artiste is only allowed to perform jobs such as singing and dancing and is only allowed to perform in the employer’s entertainment outlet;

> c)     The procedure for an online application for a work pass was such that once approved by MOM, an In-Principle Approval (“IPA”) is granted to the employer. The IPA comes in two versions, one in English and one in Mandarin;

> d)     Before the employer brings the foreign employee into Singapore, the employer would have to buy a security bond. Thereafter, a physical work permit would be issued within 14 days of the foreign employee’s arrival in Singapore;

> e)     On 28 December 2017, Liang entered Singapore;

> f)     On 11 January 2018, a work permit card that was valid for six months with an expiry date on 28 June 2018 (_Exhibit P2_) was issued to Liang;

> g)     On or about 12 January 2018, Heng and Liang signed on a physical application form for a work permit which contained the information that Liang would be employed by Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste and submitted that to the Work Pass Division to collect Liang’s work permit card. The application form contained a declaration signed by both Heng and Liang that the information as set out in the form was true and correct;

> h)     The present matter arose from a referral by the Singapore Police Force after one of Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd’s work permit holders, Liu Hui, was arrested for being involved in vice activities and investigations were conducted to determine if other work permit holders from the company were in a similar situation.

> i)     On 12 April 2018, pursuant to an Order to Produce workers of Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd served on Heng, Heng brought Liang down to the MOM for an interview;

> j)     From 13 December 2017 to 12 April 2018, Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd did not have any active business operation as there was no physical entertainment outlet in operation;

> k)     From 13 December 2017 to 12 April 2018, Liang did not work as a Performing Artiste for the Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd.

## C.   Issue

11     In light of the undisputed facts as stated above, the main issue for my determination was whether there was any _intention_ to employ Liang at Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste.

## D.   The Prosecution’s Case

12     It was the Prosecution’s case that the elements of a charge under section 22(1)(d) EFMA are as follows:

> a.     Both Heng and Liang had made statements which they knew to be false in a material particular in an “Application for a Work Permit” form submitted to the Work Pass Division, Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on or about 12 January 2018;

> b.     The false statement was that Liang would be employed by Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste; and

> c.     Heng and Liang knew that Liang would not in fact be employed by the said company.

13     In relation to Heng, pursuant to Section 20(1)(a) EFMA, the Prosecution also had to prove that Heng as the director of the company had consented to the company’s commission of the offence under section 22(1)(d) EFMA by making the declaration in his capacity as director on the application for a Work Permit that the company would be employing Liang as a Performing Artiste.

14     It was the Prosecution’s case that the actus reus of the charges against both accused persons were made out as it was undisputed that both Heng and Liang had signed on the physical application form for a work permit (_Exhibit P1_) and had declared to the Controller of Work Passes that Liang was to be employed by Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste.

15     It was also the Prosecution’s case that there was no intention for Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd to be in active operation at all material times and that in any case there was never an intention for Liang to work as a Performing Artiste at Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd. It was the Prosecution’s case theory that the purpose of the company in obtaining the work permit was to circumvent the work pass framework and immigration controls to enable Liang to stay for a longer period in Singapore.

16     The Prosecution had highlighted that the Defence’s case was that they had intended to set up an entertainment outlet in Singapore. According to Heng, he had previously failed in the industry before because the performing artistes he hired could not perform and as a result his business suffered and eventually failed. As such, he decided to bring the performing artistes in to Singapore to train them first and find a location from which to operate after he was sure that that his performing artistes were competent. It was submitted by the Prosecution that this reasoning was illogical and inherently incredible for the following reasons:

## A.   There was no intention for the company to be in active operations at all material times, and the Defence’s case that this was a genuine business set-up was inherently incredible

#### (i)   The performing artistes were on 6-month work permits but allegedly were under training for at least 3 months

17     The Prosecution had highlighted that Heng had testified that he was aware that work permits for performing artistes were valid for only 6 months. It was submitted that Heng was evasive when asked how long training would take but according to Liang who would allegedly go to the training premises to observe the dance training, she had seen the same four to five girls in the studio, during the three months that she was in Singapore. It was further submitted that given that, it was quite incredible that an employer would spend 3 months out of the 6 months’ validity period of his employees’ work permits, just letting them undergo training. When questioned on the logic of this, Heng had simply insisted that it was more profitable for him to ensure he had competent performing artistes first, before beginning operations

18     It was submitted that Liang had tried to explain away the ill logic of this by saying that she had heard from other girls working at pubs as well as pub owners that it was possible to convert the work permits to 2-year passes after the passes expired. However, she admitted that she had not sought any clarification from the authorities about this. It was the Prosecution’s case that Liang’s statement was merely an afterthought after hearing what Heng had been asked earlier.

#### (ii)   Heng and Liang did not have any written contracts or agreements

19     It was highlighted that the alleged business agreement between Heng and Liang appeared to be verbal and there were no written agreements or contracts. It was submitted that when one considers the amount that Liang was allegedly asked to pump into the business, which was $150,000, it was submitted that it was incredible that there were no written agreements at all.

#### (iii)   Liang was not concerned with the ongoings of the business set-up

20     It was submitted that Liang had claimed that she wanted to be in Singapore to check the business out and to look over its setup. However, she had admitted that she did not know details like how the artistes were being paid, what the operating costs and expenses of the company was like, and did not visit any of the alleged proposed locations of the business. Even from her testimony in court, it was clear that she was far more interested in gambling in the casinos than in the business as according to her, she only went to the studio to observe the girls on alternate days for about an hour or so, and then spent the rest of her time in casinos. It was further submitted that from Heng and Liang’s accounts, it was clear that there was little to no progress in the set-up of their business even after 3 months. It was admitted by Heng and Liang that even as of 12 April 2018, they had not found any locations to set up business. Given the above, it was the Prosecution’s case that the only logical inference that could be drawn was that there was no real intention to set up any business together.

## B.   There was no intention for Liang to work as a Performing Artiste

21     It was the Prosecution’s case that even if the Court were to accept the Defence’s case that Heng and Liang were intending to set up an entertainment outlet business together, it was clear that Liang was not supposed to be a Performing Artiste. It was submitted that firstly, Heng had stated clearly in his further statement _Exhibit P4_ that Liang did not have to work or learn how to dance. While during their testimony, both Heng and Liang had progressively tried to portray the idea that as the person managing the stage, Liang might be required to be an emcee and maybe even sing and dance on stage, this was evidently different from the job scope of a regular Performing Artiste. It was further submitted that there was no mention in their statements that Liang was going to be an emcee. It was the Prosecution’s case that in fact, Liang’s own statement indicated that she was much more of an investor than a worker.

## C.   Heng and Liang were evasive on the issue of Liang’s exact role in the company

22     It was submitted that Heng had stated in his statement in _Exhibit P4_ and in his further statement _Exhibit P5_ and Liang in her statement in _Exhibit P6_ that Liang was considered the boss of the company. Both Heng and Liang had also stated that Heng was to report to Liang. However, when questioned about this in court, both of them insisted that they were business partners and neither of them were superior to the other though both did not offer any explanation as to why this was recorded as such in their respective statements.

23     It was further submitted that when Liang was questioned specifically on whether she was considered the boss of the girls since she and Heng were business partners, Liang asserted that she was not the boss but simply a manager. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was clear that Heng and Liang were reluctant to term Liang as a boss and more eager to paint a picture of her as an employee of the company because this would be in line with their case which was that Liang was employed by Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste. However, it was submitted that as can be seen from above that their defence that the company was a genuine company with a genuine business plan was inherently incredible. It was the Prosecution’s case that the irresistible inference from the evidence there was that there was in fact no genuine business plan in place.

## Conclusion

24     It was submitted that as was stated in _Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor[^3]_, the onus is on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and not beyond all doubt. It was the Prosecution’s case that it had discharged this burden. According to the Prosecution, it had adduced clear and unequivocal evidence from its witnesses and documentary exhibits to support the charges and establish the case against both accused persons beyond reasonable doubt. Both accused persons had been unconvincing and did not produce any documentary evidence to support their case.

25     Accordingly, the Prosecution urged the Court to find both accused persons guilty and convict them on their respective charge.

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

26     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, both the accused persons had indicated that they would be giving evidence in their own defence. As I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case against both the accused persons for their respective charges I called for both Heng and Liang to enter their defences on the charges. Both of them had elected to give evidence in Court in their Defence.

## E.   The Defence’s Case

### Heng’s evidence

27     Heng testified that he has an aquarium shop. In the past, he had operated a karaoke and met an agent who told him he could recommend some girls, like singers so that he could operate a pub. His pub business then failed as he was inexperienced and he did not have singers. According to Heng, as he did not train them when they were on stage, they were unable to perform. Gradually as the business became poorer, he had no choice but to let someone take over the business.

#### Liang’s role

28     Subsequently, he wanted to operate the same kind of business again as he could make profits. He testified that he came to know Liang who told him that she could invest in the company. According to Heng as Liang’s younger sister and brother-in-law were in Singapore they could run the business. Heng further testified that they had discussed in detail as to how they should operate their business. Their agreement was that Liang was to perform on stage and he would do the daily operations of their business. According to Heng, Liang’s designation was manager for the performing artiste as she was to be in-charge of the performers.

#### The business plan

29     He had told Liang that in the past his business had failed because the rental was too high and he did not perform training for the singers. He suggested to Liang that after she came to Singapore, they should provide training to the girls before they started their business. Heng testified that it was easy for him to find a shop through _CommercialGuru_ as there were many shops in the listing. After Liang arrived, they went around looking for a shop unit. He also testified that he found a ladies’ dormitory for the girls to go through training and he had asked Liang to look after them. He gave evidence that after Liang arrived in Singapore, she was together with him and had never worked elsewhere.

#### Company’s work permit holder that was arrested by the police

30     Heng gave evidence that when Liu Hui had arrived in Singapore he had asked her to learn how to sing. She had informed him that she was told by her agent that she did not have to sing and she could just be a hostess. Heng further gave evidence that he then dismissed her and purchased an air ticket for her to return home. He then went to Malaysia for his aquarium business and upon his return to Singapore he learnt that Liu Hui was arrested.

31     During his cross-examination, Heng testified that on 12 April 2018 when he brought Liang to MOM, Baby Karoke Club Pte was not in operation. When he was about to set up the shop, he and Liang had a dispute about the arrangements for the girls. Liang told him that an officer at MOM had informed her that the arrangements for the girls was an offence. He testified that from the period 13 December 2017 to 12 April 2018, Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd was not in operation. He also testified that Liang was not paid a salary as it was agreed that they would only get a salary after the pub was set up.

### Liang’s evidence

32     Liang testified that she was presently not working pending the outcome of the present matter. She came to know Heng when she was in China and he had asked her if she was interested in investing $150,000 in a pub business. Liang further testified that as she had never met Heng before, Heng suggested that he could help her get a work permit in order for her to come to Singapore. Liang could be his business partner and at the same time manage the stage performance. During her cross-examination, Liang testified that she invested $30,000 in the business seven or eight days after her arrival in Singapore. This was because she did not know him well at that time and did not feel at ease to give him a lump sum of $150,000.

#### Liang’s activities in Singapore

33     Liang gave evidence that after she arrived in Singapore on 28 December 2017, she realised that the company had not started business operations. Heng had found bigger a bigger location for the girls to practice their dancing. Liang was to go to the location every day to train the girls for more than an hour and to teach them what to do. She testified that for the rest of the time she would be at the casino as Heng was still looking around for a suitable location to set up the pub.

34     Liang further testified that after about two to three months, the girls all left and returned home. The girls had telephoned Liang and asked her to leave Singapore but she refused to do so as she had not done anything wrong. She gave evidence that the girls did not tell her why they had chosen to leave. She gave evidence that she went to MOM to explain clearly. After her statement was recorded at MOM, her work permit was cancelled.

35     During her cross-examination, Liang maintained even in March 2018 they had a plan to start operations as she had brought along all the money with her. She confirmed that on 12 April 2018, both of them had not found a location to start operations. They only had a dance studio and all the girls had left. She disagreed with the Prosecution that her purpose of applying for a work pass was simply to validate her stay for 6 months. She testified that she was aware that when she signed the application form it was for her to get a work pemit to work for Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd. She agreed with the Prosecution that she in fact never worked for the company but disagreed that she had no intention to be employed by the company as a Performing Artiste.

## F.   Assessment of Evidence

36     Eligible employers in Singapore can hire foreign performing artistes to work in public entertainment outlets such as bars, hotels and nightclubs provided the employers’ businesses satisfy the criteria for eligibility and the requirements in the work pass framework as prescribed by MOM. As set out in the MOM website, if an employer wants to hire a foreign performing artiste to work in Singapore, the employer’s business must:

> i)     Have a CAT 1 Public Entertainment Licence issued by the Singapore Police Force;

> ii)     Operate at least 6 hours a day;

> iii)     Be classified as a bar, discotheque, lounge, nightclub, pub, hotel, private club or restaurant;

> iv)     Employ at least one local employee who earns the Local Qualifying Salary.

In addition, the maximum period of employment for a performimg artiste is 6 months and a foreign worker levy has to be paid for each artiste depending on the number that are hired. The restrictions imposed by MOM on foreign performing artiste include the following:

> i)     Foreign performing artiste are not allowed to hold another work permit (even for another occupation) for 1 year after they stop work as a performing artiste);

> ii)     Foreign performing artistes must only perform jobs related to stage performance, such as singing and dancing. They cannot be deployed to carry out any other jobs within the same business;

> iii)     There are also specific activities that are not allowed under SPF’s Entertainment Licensing Conditions such as mingling with customers.

37     The present case involved false declarations on a material particular made on 12 January 2018 to the Controller of Work Passes by both Heng and Liang on a physical application form for a Performing Artiste work permit for Liang. Heng and Liang had signed the application form containing material information that Liang would be employed by Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste and had submitted the application form to the Work Pass Division to collect Liang’s work permit card.

38     It was the Prosecution’s case that there was no intention for Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd to be in active operation at all material time and that in any event, there was never an intention for Liang to work as a Performing Artiste at Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd. This was because from 13 December 2017 to 12 April 2018, Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd did not have any active business operation as there was no physical entertainment outlet to operate from. In addition, during the said period it was unchallenged that Liang did not work as a Performing Artiste for the Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd. According to the Prosecution, the Defence’s case that this was a genuine business set-up was inherently incredible for the reasons as set out at paragraphs 17 to 20 above. In essence, it was the Prosecution’s case theory that the purpose of the company in obtaining the work permit for Liang was to circumvent the work pass framework and immigration controls to enable Liang to stay for a longer period in Singapore.

39     In contrast, it was the defence’s case that Heng and Liang had intended to set up a pub business in Singapore. Liang was to invest $150,000 in the business. As Heng had previously failed in his previous pub business, their plan was to bring the performing artistes in to Singapore to train them first and find a location from which to operate after Heng was sure that that his performing artistes were competent. According to Liang, Heng had suggested that he help her get a work permit in order for her to come to Singapore. Liang could be his business partner and at the same time manage the stage performance.

40     In my assessment of the evidence, I was mindful that it was undisputed that both Heng and Liang had signed on the physical application form for a work permit (_Exhibit P1_) and had declared to the Controller of Work Passes that Liang was to be employed by Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution and found that the actus reus of the offence had been made out. In addition as it was undisputed that Heng was one of the signatories of the physical application form, the element that the offence was committed with the consent of an officer of a body corporate under section 20(1)(a) EFMA in **MAC 901452-2019** had also been satisfied.

41     The main issue for my determination was whether there was any _intention_ by the company to employ Liang at Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste.

42     To my mind, it was clear from the requirements of the work pass framework prescribed by MOM as highlighted at paragraph 36 above, if an employer wants to hire a foreign performing artiste to work in Singapore, the employer’s business must be a going concern or in operation. In my view, the requirements would not be satisfied if it was merely a business plan to bring the performing artistes into Singapore, train them first and find a physical location from which to operate after making sure that that the performing artistes were competent as contended by Heng. In any event, I noted that no evidence had been adduced by Heng that when Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd made the application for a work permit, the company had met the requirements prescribed by MOM.

43     In the present case, I found that Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd was clearly not in operation as it was unchallenged that from 13 December 2017 to 12 April 2018, it did not even have any physical entertainment outlet in operation. In fact, none of the foreign employees who had work passes as performing artistes issued under the company as listed in Heng’s statements had even worked as performing artistes. I also found that after Liang’s arrival in Singapore, she was not employed as a performing artiste by the company. I agreed with the Prosecution that both Heng and Liang were evasive on the issue of Liang’s exact role in the company in their testimonies and were more eager to paint a picture of her as an employee of the company which was inconsistent with their earlier own unchallenged statements. I also agreed with the Prosecution case that from Liang’s testimony and her own statement her role was more of an investor rather than an employee of Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd.

44     In his own unchallenged statement at paragraph 10 A) in _Exhibit P4_, Heng himself had stated clearly that Liang “…_does not have to work or learn how to dance. She is considered as the boss if the company even though she is holding onto a work permit as a performing artiste."_ In addition, Liang herself gave evidence that she had not worked as a Performing Artiste and only went on alternate days to the dance studio to supervise the girls while the rest of her time were spent at the casino.

45     Hence, I rejected Heng’s testimony that the arrangement between them was for Liang to perform on stage and that he had engaged her to come to Singapore to work for the company. On the facts, I found that there was no intention to employ Liang at Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd as a Performing Artiste. I also found that from the facts it can be inferred that as a director of Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd, Heng’s purpose in applying for the work permit for Liang as a performing artiste was to circumvent the work pass framework and immigration controls to enable Liang to stay for a longer period in Singapore for reasons best known to them.

46     After having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the accused persons, I was satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution had established all the essential elements of the respective charges against both accused in the present case. I agreed with the Prosecution that it had adduced clear and unequivocal evidence from its witnesses and documentary exhibits to support the charges and establish the case against both accused beyond reasonable doubt.

47     Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt the charges in **MAC-901452-2019** and **MAC-901456-2019** and found both accused persons Heng and Liang guilty and convicted them accordingly.

The accused had declared on the said Forms that B1 to B3 would be employed by TTL as Performing Artistes when he knew that this was false. The accused knew that TTL had no intention of employing B1 to B3. B1 to B3 did not work for TTL after their work permits were issued. They had in fact paid sums of money ranging from RMB10,000 to RMB60,000 to agents in China in order to obtain work passes that would allow them to validate their stay in Singapore, rather than for gainful employment. B1 ended up engaging in vice activities, B2 attempted to find other employment, whilst B3 worked illegally as a drinks stall assistant. Three charges under section 22(1)(d) EFMA were taken into consideration.

> f)      **_PP v Mariappan Banumathi_** (MAC 9004293 - 2019 & Anor)

The accused knew from Shanthi in 2014 that she could earn more money working as a part-time Domestic Worker in Singapore. The accused subsequently formed an intention to source for a pseudo-employer to apply for a Work Permit so as to legalise her stay in Singapore to work as a Domestic Worker. The accused contacted Shanthi to make the necessary arrangements for her. Through Shanthi, the accused was introduced to M M Santhiya and was told that she could assist her in the sourcing of a pseudo employer and to apply for a Work Permit to allow her to work part-time in Singapore. Shanthi, Santhiya, Nityakalyani and the accused had a phone conversation while the accused was in India to confirm the arrangement. On 13 July 2017, the application form for a Work Permit was received by the MOM where the accused declared that she intended to be employed by Nityakalyani as a Domestic Worker at her residence. However, the accused was never employed as a Domestic Worker at Nityakalyani's residence. Instead, the accused worked as a part-time cleaner/ Domestic Worker in Singapore. Even though the accused resided at Nityakalyani's residence, she needed to pay her rent of $250 a month and also had to pay her own levy of $65 a month.

> g)      **_PP v Chinnadurai Malathi_**

> The accused had claimed trial to a charge under section 22(1)(d) EFMA and a charge under section 10(1) EFMA and was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $5,000 in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment respectively on 3 February 2020 in Court 13A. The accused was untraced.

> **Brief facts**: The accused had conspired with one Nityakalyani to make a false statement in an application form for a work permit, that she would be employed by Nityakalyani as a domestic worker, when she knew this to be false. She in fact worked as a part-time maid for about 6 months following the issuance of her work permit. During the material period, she also did not stay with Nityakalyani, and sourced for employment on her own. She also paid Nityakalyani salary.

50     It was submitted that the first five cases all involve foreigners where false declaration were made in the application for work permit in order to validate their stay in Singapore. The sentences ranged from 10 days’ to 10 weeks’ imprisonment depending the facts of the case. It was further submitted that in _Kok Yau Choy_, there was a difference in sentences for different charges. For the first charge in MAC 900123 - 2019, he was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment as there was vice involved whereas for the other two charges where there was no vice involved, he was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment per charge. In these five cases, the accused had pleaded guilty in the mentions court whereas in the last two cases both accused persons had claimed trial, were convicted and sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

51     It was the Prosecution that based on the above precedents and given the following factors in the present case namely:

> a)     the falsehood was material;

> b)     the deception was conscious, planned and difficult to detect;

> c)     as a consequence of her deception Liang was able to prolonge her stay in Singapore while remaining unemployed;

> d)     there was circumvention of the work pass framework and immigration controls because the purpose was for her to get a pass which allowed her to stay longer in Singapore;

it was submitted that from the case of _Chiew Kok Chai v PP_[^4] the starting point is a custodial sentence. It was the Prosecution’s case that the sentence for both accused persons should be nothing less than five weeks’ imprisonment.

## I.   Mitigation

52     In his oral plea in mitigation, Heng submitted that they had a genuine intention to start a business together. He further submitted that they have never deceived MOM and they only found out what they had done was wrong after they went to MOM. Heng highlighted that they had spent money and rented the space for the girls’ to practice their dance moves.

53     Heng further submitted that he did not expect this to happen to him. They were unable to set up the company and he ended up in Court. He urged the Court to give him a chance.

54     In her oral plea in mitigation, Liang submitted that when she received the in-principle approval when she was in China, she did not know that her employer had no physical space to operate his business. She further submitted that after she received her work permit, she had asked Heng to bring her to his company. When she came to Singapore, she had the in-principle approval and she thought that this was a legal document. Before she came to Singapore, she did not know anything about the country. When she found out that there was no physical shop, half a month had already passed.

## J.   The Sentences

55     The prescribed punishment for an offence of making a false statement or furnishing false information in any material particular in connection with the application or the renewal of a work pass to the Controller of Work Passes is a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or to both under section 22(1)(ii) EFMA. In the present case, the Prosecution had sought the imposition of a sentence of not less than five weeks’ imprisonment for each of the accused persons.

#### Sentencing considerations

56     In determining the appropriate sentences for the present case, I was guided by the sentencing framework as set out by the High Court in _Chiew Kok Chai v PP[^5]_ for offences under section 22(1)(d) EFMA and punishable under section 22(1)(ii) of the said Act. I was mindful that in _Chiew Kok Chai_ at \[49\], the High Court held that the predominant sentencing consideration for an offence under section 22(1)(d) is deterrence and any deception of public institutions which frustrates the aims of the EFMA should not be condoned. It was also held at \[62\]

> Based on the above consideration, a custodial sentence should be the starting point for offences under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA, given the legislative objective of the EFMA in maintaining the integrity of the Singaporean workforce, the resultant need for deterrence to prevent circumvention of the work pass framework, and the seriousness and prevalence of such offences.

57     In determining the appropriate length of the sentences for both accused, I had calibrated it using “two-step sentencing bands” approach proposed by the Prosecution and endorsed by the High Court in _Chiew Kok Chai_ as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.8433686737347%"> <col width="56.131226245249%"> <col width="27.0254050810162%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Elaboration</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lower end of the spectrum, involving one or very few offence-specific factors, or where offence-specific factors were not present to a significant degree.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Short custodial sentence of less than five months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Middle band of the spectrum, involving higher levels of seriousness or harm, comprising cases falling between Bands 1 and 3.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Five to 15 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Higher end of the spectrum, involving numerous offence-specific factors, or where offence-specific factors were present to a significant degree.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

58     Moving to the sentencing framework proper, I had to consider the following non-exhaustive offence specific factors to consider at the first stage:

> a.     the materiality of the false representation on the mind of the decision-maker – the greater the impact of the falsehood in inducing the grant of the application, the more severe the sentence imposed;

> b.     the nature, sophistication and extent of the deception – more severe punishment is merited if the applicant went to greater lengths to deceive or if he acted in conscious defiance of public authorities;

> c.     the consequences of the deception – the court may consider the extent to which harm was caused to foreign workers by way of exploitation, the wastage of resources by public authorities in uncovering the deception, whether a potentially better-qualified applicant was deprived of the job opportunity, or whether the offender put others at risk of adverse consequences by performing a job without the requisite skills;

> d.     whether a transnational element was present and/or whether the offence was committed as part of a criminal syndicate’s operations;

> e.     the specific role played by the offender, and, relatedly, the number of people involved in the furnishing of false information;

> f.     whether the offender obtained gains (financial or otherwise) from the commission of the offence; and

> g.     the motive of the offender in circumventing the work pass framework, _e.g._, for vice or criminal activities.

59     Once the gravity of the offence has been ascertained based on these factors, I had to place the offence within an appropriate band. In the present case, based on the Prosecution’s submissions, it was the Prosecution’s position that the offences fell into Band 1 that attracted a short custodial sentence of less than five months’ imprisonment.

60     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the falsehood was material and the deception was conscious, planned and difficult to detect in view of the multitude of such applications that MOM would ordinarily receive. This enabled Liang to prolonge her stay in Singapore while remaining unemployed. It was clear that there was no intention for Liang to be a performing artiste. Hence, there was circumvention of the work pass framework and immigration controls as the work pass had enabled her to stay longer in Singapore as compared to a visit entry permit.

61     Nevertheless, there was no evidence that they went to great lengths to deceive MOM or that they had acted in conscious defiance of public authorities. No harm was caused to Liang as there was no evidence that Heng had exploitated her. What was notable was that Heng was the one who suggested that he applied for a work pass to enable Liang to come to Singapore to facilitate her ‘investment’ into his business plan. The case was uncovered arising from a referral from the police and did not involve the wastage of resources by public authorities in uncovering the deception. In view of few offence specific factors present in this case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the present charges fell within Band 1.

62     At the second stage, I took take into account the “offender-specific factors”, i.e. the personal mitigating factors applicable to the offender. This relates to the offender’s character, personal attributes, expression of remorse, and cooperation with the authorities. In the present case, I found that there were nothing exceptional nor any strong personal mitigating factors present in respect of both accused persons. While Heng had unrelated antecedents, Liang was a first offender. In addition, in his mitigation despite his conviction Heng continued to maintain that they had a genuine intention to start a business together and that they have never deceived MOM. To my mind, this was indicative of a lack of remorse and an attempt to downplay his culpability. As both accused persons had claimed trial to the charge under section 22(1)(d) EFMA, they were not entitled to any discount in sentencing which is usually afforded to an accused person or a defendant company that had pleaded guilty.

63     I next considered the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused persons that would fall within Band 1.

#### Sentencing precedents

64     The Prosecution had tendered seven cases under section 22(1)(d) as sentencing precedents in support of its submissions for a sentence of not less than five weeks’ imprisonment. As all seven cases were unreported cases and there were no written grounds of decisions given in these cases, I was mindful of the lack of precedential value for unreported cases although it provided some reference as to the range of sentences imposed for an offence under section 22(1)(d) EFMA.

65     It was clear the prescribed punishment for the offences under section 22(1)(d) EFMA was to deter potential offenders or like minded offenders like the accused persons. In view of the above, the sentence imposed has to be sufficient highly to serve as a form of general deterrence to like-minded offenders as well as specific deterrence to the accused persons.

66     In the present case, after a careful consideration of the totality of the evidence as well as his personal mitigating factors, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions and imposed a sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment on Heng in **MAC 901452-2019**. In respect of Liang, I disagreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that a similar sentence of five weeks imprisonment should be imposed. In my view, her level of culpability was slightly lower than that of Heng as it was clear that Heng had played a more active role in the deception to MOM. He was the one who as director of Baby Karaoke Club Pte Ltd had facilitated the application for a work pass as a Performing Artiste for Liang. After a careful consideration of the totality of the evidence as well as her personal mitigating factors, I imposed a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment on Liang.

67     In my view, the sentences imposed on both Heng and Liang were just an appropriate and proportionate given their culpability, the level of harm involved and the other factors as stated above including the fact that both accused persons had claimed trial and was thus not entitled to a sentencing discount.

68     Dissatisfied with my decision both accused person have appealed against their respective conviction and sentence and are presently on bail pending the hearing of their appeal.
