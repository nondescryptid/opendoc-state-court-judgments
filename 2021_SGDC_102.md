### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused is male Singaporean. He is now 54 years old (D.O.B.: 15 April 1967).

2       On 17 July 2020, the Accused pleaded guilty to two charges, namely, consumption of a Class A controlled drug, the subject matter in DAC 910347/2020 (“the consumption offence”) and possession of utensil intended for consumption of a controlled drug, the subject matter in DAC 910357/2020 (“the utensil offence”).

3       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts[^1] without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly.

4       The Accused then admitted to the commission of another count of consumption of a Class A controlled drug, the subject matter in DAC 910356/2020. He consented to have this charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

5       After considering the Prosecution’s position on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I imposed the following sentences:

6       The two imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently making an aggregate sentence of three years' imprisonment (“the aggregate sentence”). I ordered the aggregate sentence to commence upon the expiry of current sentence (see \[16\] below) being served.

## Criminal Motion (No. 55 of 2020)

7       In October 2020, the Accused filed a Criminal Motion to the High Court seeking leave for an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal.

8       In January 2021, the motion was allowed pursuant to s 408A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). The Accused duly filed a Notice of Appeal. It is an appeal against sentence.

9       Arising therefrom, I now provide my grounds of decision (see \[24\] to \[34\] below).

## Facts of The Case

10     On 17 August 2019 at about 10.00 pm, at Boon Lay MRT Station, the Accused was arrested by police officers from the Woodlands Police Division for controlled drug related offences. At the time of the arrest, one metal smoking pipe was seized from the Accused.

11     The Accused was taken to the Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters where two bottles of his urine samples were procured. The Accused’s urine samples, duly sealed and marked, were then sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA") for analysis. The result of the analysis, certified by two different analysts from HSA[^2], revealed that the Accused’s urine samples contained a Class A controlled drug known as 2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1Hindole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group.

12     The Accused admitted that he had consumed the said controlled drug just before his arrest. He had used the metal smoking pipe to aid in his consumption of the said controlled drug. The Accused was not authorised under the MDA or its Regulations to consume the said controlled drug.

13     The metal smoking pipe was sent to the HSA for analysis. The result of the analysis revealed that the metal smoking pipe was stained with the said controlled drug.[^3] The Accused was not authorised under the MDA or its Regulations to possess the metal smoking pipe.

14     The Accused is a repeat offender for consumption of a controlled drug. The Accused was convicted on 17 March 2010 for consumption of Morphine, a Specified Drug under the MDA. This is an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and punishable under s 33A(1) of the MDA. The Accused was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.[^4]

15     In view of the Accused’s previous conviction as stated in \[14\] above, he was liable to enhanced punishment under s 33(4) of the MDA for the consumption offence in the present case. The punishment prescribed by law is a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of three years with the maximum at ten years.

## Other Material Facts

16     On 5 December 2019, the Accused was convicted and sentenced in respect of the following offences (“the 2019 offences”):[^5]

17     The Accused’s earliest date of release for the above imprisonment term is 8 May 2022. His latest date of release is 6 September 2023.[^6]

## Antecedents

18     The Accused has numerous criminal convictions dating as far back as May 1995.

19     For the purposes of the present case, the relevant criminal convictions[^7] are:

> (a)     Consumption of a controlled drug (1995 and 2010);

> (b)     Trafficking in a controlled drug (2010); and

> (c)     Failure to report for urine test (1997).

20     The Accused has gone through drug rehabilitations in a Drug Rehabilitation Centre in 1984, 1991, 1993 and 2000.[^8] He was placed under drug supervision in 1985, 1992, 1995, 2002 and 2014.[^9]

## Prosecution’s position on sentence

21     The Prosecution submitted for a three years’ imprisonment term for the consumption offence and a three months’ imprisonment term for the utensil offence. The Prosecution further submitted that two imprisonment terms were to run concurrently. Lastly, the Prosecution submitted that the sentence was to commence from the date it was passed.

## Defence’s plea-in-mitigation

22     The Accused gave his mitigation verbally. He accepted full responsibility for his crimes. On his drug addiction, he claimed that he had tried his best to change. But it was in a moment of folly that he succumbed again.

23     The Accused informed that he was then serving a four years’ jail sentence. He asked the court not to impose a sentence that would be crushing on him. To this end, he asked the court to run his sentence concurrently with the imprisonment term that he was still serving.

## Court’s decision on sentence

### Sentences imposed

24     In my judgment, the indicative starting points for the consumption offence and the utensil offence is three years’ imprisonment and three month’s imprisonment respectively. There was nothing exceptional on the facts of this case, either in term of aggravating factors or mitigating factors, to warrant any adjustment from the indicative starting points. In the circumstances, I finalised my decision and imposed: (i) three years’ imprisonment for the consumption offence; and (ii) three months’ imprisonment for the utensil offence.

25     Having regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle (see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>), I ordered the two imprisonment terms to run concurrently. The aggregate sentence was thus three years’ imprisonment.

### Date that sentence begins

26     Having decided the individual sentences and the aggregate sentence, I now turn to decide the date that the aggregate sentence should commence. In this regard, the following two statutory provisions are applicable:

> (a)     Section 318(1) of the CPC which states that a sentence of imprisonment shall take effect beginning on the date it was passed, unless the court passing the sentence otherwise directs; and

> (b)     Section 322(1) of the CPC which states that where a person is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced again to imprisonment, the latter sentence of imprisonment must begin either immediately or at the end of the imprisonment to which he was previously sentenced, as the court awarding the sentence directs.

27     In my judgment, I applied s 322(1) of the CPC and ordered the aggregate sentence to commence upon the expiry of current sentence (see \[16\] above) being served. My reasons are set out below.

28     First, as a general rule, an offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively: _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen_”) at \[41\]. Menon CJ gave four reasons for this general rule. I found that two of the reasons applied with full force in the present case and I reproduced them below:

> 43    Secondly, in many situations, concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would not adequately serve, and in fact may undermine, the sentencing considerations that underlie the individual sentences comprising the aggregate term. For one thing, the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would afford an offender who has already committed an offence less or no real incentive to refrain from committing a further offence, in so far as such a sentencing position would result in the offender not having to bear any real consequence for the further offending. This creates a distorted incentive that detracts from the deterrent value of the individual sentences notionally imposed. … …

> … …

> 44    If the need to give sufficient weight to deterrence can afford a justification for a sentencing court to depart from the one-transaction rule and impose consecutive sentences for related offences, then the same interest should logically justify and indeed call for the imposition of consecutive sentences in relation to unrelated offences. Furthermore, from the retributivist perspective, imposing concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would mean that the second or later legally protected interest that was infringed would have no apparent vindication in law. Neither would the duration of imprisonment adequately reflect the greater need for public protection against a multiple offender who cannot claim to have acted in an isolated instance of misjudgment.

> 45    … …

> 46    Fourthly, and perhaps most intuitively, allowing a multiple offender to be punished less seriously, or even not at all, for a second or further offending would be a perverse outcome that flies in the face of any notion of justice. … …

29     In my judgment, the Accused’s 2019 conviction (see \[16\] above) dealt with offences that are totally unrelated to the present set of offences. There was clearly no proximity in time, place, continuity of action, and continuity in purpose or design. It would thus be wrong in principle to order the aggregate sentence to run concurrently with the imprisonment term that the Accused was given in 2019.

30     The operation of the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences was subject to three qualifications: the totality principle, the fact that the rule was neither invariable nor mandatory and may be departed from, and the need to give effect to any statutory provision that abridged the operation of the general rule. (see _Raveen_ at \[65\] to \[67\]). I have considered these qualifications and I was satisfied that none applied to this case.

31     Second, the operation of s 322(1) was discussed in _Public Prosecutor v Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 527</span> (“_Hang Tuah_”). The offender was sentenced to a total of four years and 11 months’ imprisonment for one charge of sexual penetration of a minor, four charges relating to driving without a valid licence and one charge for possessing obscene videos. At the time of sentencing, the offender was in the midst of serving a 12-year imprisonment term for two previous convictions for rape and driving without a valid licence. The district judge ordered the further sentence of four years 11 months to commence on the date the sentence was passed. The prosecution appealed. On appeal, the High Court held that the approach adopted by the district judge was wrong as it effectively rendered the sentences imposed nugatory. The High Court reduced the overall imprisonment sentence to two years and ordered the revised sentence to take effect after the offender had completed his 12-year imprisonment term. In coming to its decision, the High Court laid out the following principles:

> (i)     The discretion must be exercised judiciously.[^10]

> (ii)     The court is not entitled to backdate the sentence of any offender who is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment.[^11]

> (iii)     In deciding to order a subsequent term of imprisonment to run immediately or at the expiration of the earlier term of imprisonment, the court should have regard to whether the subsequent offence(s) arose in the “same transaction” as the earlier offence(s), and also the totality of the sentence to be served. **The fact that the subsequent offence(s) arose in different transactions is a weighty consideration that warrants the imposition of an order that the subsequent term of imprisonment should start at the expiration of the earlier term of imprisonment**.[^12] (Emphasis mine.)

> (iv)     The court’s primary duty is to determine the appropriate sentence which would best ensure that the ends of justice are met. No single consideration can conclusively determine the proper sentence and, in seeking to arrive at the proper sentence, the court must balance many factors, sometimes rejecting some. **One factor that the court should consider is whether the totality of the sentence served is proportionate to the inherent gravity of all the offences committed by the accused**. Hence, while the individual sentence for a particular offence may be perfectly appropriate, the cumulative effect of the sentences may well result in a total term of imprisonment that is disproportionate to the overall criminality of the accused.[^13] (Emphasis mine.)

> (v)     In contemplating the totality of the sentences imposed on the accused, the trial judge should consider this question: if all the offences had been before him, would he still have passed a sentence of similar length? If not, the judge should adjust the sentence imposed for the latest offence in light of the aggregate sentence. Whether this is done by imposing a shorter sentence to run consecutively or a long sentence to commence immediately, does not at the end of the day make much difference, although in principle, the judge should, as far as possible, try to impose a sentence that is reflective of the gravity of the latest offence(s) in question.[^14]

32     In my deliberation for this case, I was mindful of the above principles, in particular \[31(iii)\], \[31(iv)\] and \[31(v)\]. In the present case, the punishment mandated by law for the consumption offence is _at least_ three years’ imprisonment. The court could not pass a lower sentence. The court also did not have the power to alter any of the sentences imposed on the Accused’s 2019 conviction. Therefore, the main guiding principle would be the totality principle. In this regard, my assessment was that ordering the aggregate sentence to commence at the completion of his current sentence is proportionate to the inherent gravity of all the offences committed by the Accused. Accordingly, it would not run afoul of the totality principle.

33     Third, if the aggregate sentence was ordered to commence on the day it was passed, it would have a real and immediate effect of truncating the total imprisonment term for the 2019 offences from 48 months to slightly more than ten months.[^15] The Accused would have thus obtained an unwarranted discount of 38 months. This, in my view, could not be correct.

34     Fourth, I put great emphasis to the sentencing principle of deterrence.

> (a)     Offences involving controlled drugs are prevalent in Singapore. General deterrence was thus applicable in this case. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender. Deterrence is generally not displaced as an applicable sentencing consideration even where an offender demonstrates that he was labouring under familial and financial hardships during the commission of the offence: see _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”) at \[24\] – \[25\], \[27\] and \[29\].

> (b)     The Accused is a recalcitrant for controlled drugs related offences. Specific deterrence was also applicable in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an accused to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition: _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[25\] – \[29\].

In my judgment, deterrence is best served by ordering the aggregate sentence to commence upon the expiry of current sentence (see \[16\] above) being served.
