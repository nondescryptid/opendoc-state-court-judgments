Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9120/2022/01.\]

18 July 2022

### District Judge Ow Yong Tuck Leong:

1       The accused, Shahradie Bin Bakir, a 51-year-old male, pleaded guilty to 3 proceeded charges and consented to 4 other charges being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for sentencing.

2       The 3 proceeded charges were:

> (i)     the 1st charge, committing a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of his remission order by failing to remain indoors at Selarang Halfway House at the specified time in accordance with s 50V of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev. Ed. 2014). The accused was liable to be punished under s 50Y of the Prisons Act with a sentence not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order.

> (ii)     the 2nd charge, consuming Monoacetylmorphine without authorisation and committing an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed). The accused was previously convicted of similar offences and liable for enhanced punishment under s 33A of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The maximum penalty was 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The accused was also subject to a remission order and liable to be punished under s 50T of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order.

> (iii)     the 5th charge, for failing to present himself for urine test under Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Reg 3 Rev. Ed. 1999). The maximum penalty was 4 years’ imprisonment or $10,000 fine or both. The accused was also subject to a remission order and liable to be punished under s 50T of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order.

3       The 4 TIC charges were 2 charges for consuming Methamphetamine and Monoacetylmorphine, and 2 charges for failing to present himself for urine test.

4       I sentenced the accused to 7 years 21 months’ imprisonment and 517 days of imprisonment, with an enhancement of 362 days’ imprisonment. The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence has filed a notice of appeal against sentence. The Accused is presently serving his sentence. These are the grounds for the sentence imposed.

### Statement of Facts

5       The accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) tendered by the Prosecution. I set out the SOF below:

> 5.    The Remission Order also specified that a failure to remain indoors, when required to do so under the Remission Order or at the time and day specified by supervision officer(s) or Manager of the halfway house, for a cumulative period of 24 hours would constitute a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition.

> 6.    The accused signed on the said Remission Order on 6 October 2020, acknowledging that the contents of the said Remission Order had been fully explained to and understood by him.

> **Breach of the Mandatory Aftercare Condition**

On the same date, he was convicted of three counts of failing to report for urine test and for each count he was sentenced to a fine of $2,000, in default 4 weeks’ imprisonment. On 22nd December 2008, the accused was convicted of one count of failing to report for urine test and was sentenced to an imprisonment of 6 months. On the same date, he was convicted of trafficking a controlled drug and was sentenced to 5 years and five strokes of the cane.

On the same date, he was convicted of another count of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug and was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment. On 6th May 2015, he was convicted of one count of smoking, self-administering or consuming a specific drug and he was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 7 years and 3 months. On the same date, he was convicted of two counts of failing to report for urine test and for each count he was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

7       The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 7 years 21 months and 879 days’ imprisonment. The sentencing framework for sentences under s 50Y and enhanced sentences under s 50T of the Prisons Act in _Abdul Mutalib Bin Azman v PP and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span> (_“Abdul Mutalib”_) applied to the present case. In particular, the Prosecution referred to the application of the sentencing framework in the _Amanshah_ appeal in MA 9790 of 2020 (_Abdul Mutalib_ at \[115\]).

8       The sentencing court should first determine the imprisonment sentence for the s 50Y offence, given that imprisonment was mandatory for the s 50Y offence. The court should then consider whether to impose any enhanced sentence under s 50T and determine the appropriate enhanced sentence under s 50T from the most serious to the least serious of the fresh offence. The cumulative sentence imposed under ss 50Y and 50T could not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offender’s earliest offence. Once the maximum duration of the enhanced sentence(s) that may be imposed has been reached, there would be no need for the sentencing court to engage in a separate analysis of the appropriate enhanced sentence to impose for each of the other fresh offences.

9       The sentencing band approach applied to both sentencing for ss 50Y and 50T. The sentencing band framework comprised a three-fold classification of “low”, “moderate” and “high”, with each classification being tied to the serious breach of the mandatory aftercare conditions or the severity of the fresh offence. The sentencing court should identify the appropriate degree of severity within a particular sentencing band and arrive at a fraction or percentage of the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the relevant offence.

10     The sentencing factors relevant to determining the applicable sentencing band was classified into three categories: (a) factors going towards the gravity of the offence committed by the offender while on remission; (b) factors going towards the offender’s rehabilitative prospects; and (c) all other relevant circumstances.

11     For the 1st charge, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s culpability was at the higher end of Band 2. The indicative starting point was 517 days (being 60% of the maximum 862 days in the 1st charge). The accused breached curfew by a total of 3648 hours. The accused’s rehabilitative prospects were low. The cumulative period of time in which the accused did not commit any breach of a mandatory aftercare condition after being released under the remission order was approximately 4 months. The accused received 4 reminders to return but did not do so. The accused was only apprehended when arrested for suspected consumption of controlled drugs. The Prosecution considered the offender-specific factors under ‘all other relevant circumstances’ and submitted that there were no relevant offender-specific factors in the present case. Hence, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 517 days’ imprisonment for the 1st charge.

12     For the 2nd charge, the Prosecution submitted for 7 years 6 months’ imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 362 days’ imprisonment under s 50T. There should be a slight uplift from the mandatory sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane as the accused was a repeat LT-2 offender. The sentencing position was in line with the precedent in _Yusran bin Yusoff_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 74</span>, where the offender was convicted after trial on a repeat LT-2 charge for consumption of morphine and was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. He had reoffended shortly after his last stint in prison. He was released in November 2011 and arrested in December 2012. The appeal was dismissed. The Prosecution also submitted that they were not seeking for imprisonment in lieu of caning.

13     For the enhanced sentence under s 50T, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s culpability was at the higher end of Band 2. The accused had committed a serious offence. The fresh offence was committed approximately 11 months after the accused’s release from prison. The fresh offence was the exact same offence as the original offence, thereby demonstrating that the accused’s rehabilitative prospects were low. The indicative starting point was 391 days (being 60% of the maximum 653 days). In the present case, the maximum duration of the cumulative ss 50Y and 50T sentences that could be imposed was 879 days. This was the remaining duration of the remission order from the date of the earliest offence committed by the accused, which was the 5th charge. In order for the aggregate sentence under ss 50Y and 50T to not exceed the total remission period of 879 days, the Prosecution submitted that the enhanced sentence for the 2nd charge should be lowered to 362 days.

14     For the 5th charge, the prosecution submitted for a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment as the accused was previously sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for the same offence in 2015, thereby justifying the need for specific deterrence. The sentencing position was in line with the precedent in _PP v Azizun Bin Ismail_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 300</span>, where the offender pleaded guilty to failing to report for urine test and was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. He was previously sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge for failing to report for urine tests. The appeal was dismissed.

15     Applying _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> (_“Shouffee”_), the Prosecution submitted that the sentences for all 3 charges should run consecutively. All 3 charges were different in nature and offend different legal interests. The aggregate sentence was not substantially above the normal level of at least 7 years’ imprisonment sentence for repeat LT-2 offenders and did not offend the totality principle. A significant portion of the aggregate sentence arose from the sentence for the 1st charge and the enhanced sentence for the 2nd charge, where it was statutorily provided that they run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment pursuant to ss 50Y(5) and 50T(5) respectively. The accused had committed the offences whilst he was on remission, suggesting low rehabilitative prospects. The accused had many drug-related antecedents similar to the drug-related charges in the present case. The proposed sentence was therefore in keeping with his past record and his future prospects.

### Mitigation

16     The accused said he was deeply remorseful and pleaded for leniency. He wished to take care of his aged mother and his younger brother. His mother was ill, and his brother was a cancer patient in remission. He requested for the minimal global sentence and for the sentence to be backdated for time spent in remand.

### Court’s Decision

17     The sentencing framework principles in _Abdul Mutalib_ apply to the present case (_Abdul Mutalib_ at \[87\]). The ss 50Y and 50T legislation provide a mechanism to rescind the whole or part of the remission period granted to an offender in respect of his original offence(s) so as to deter him from reoffending after his release from prison, while incentivising him to stay crime-free for as long as possible (_Abdul Mutalib_ at \[35\]).

18     I determined the s 50Y offence first. The accused was placed at Selarang Halfway House under a structured aftercare regime that provided enhanced support with tight supervision for ex-offenders at risk or re-offending and those who needed more support in re-integration into society. The breach was grave as the accused stayed away from Selarang Halfway Home for a substantial period of time. The accused admitted that he did not have any valid reasons for not returning to Selarang Halfway House (see paragraph 10 of the SOF). The accused demonstrated a lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration on his part. The breach was committed about 4 months after his release from prisons, and he did not return to the half-way house despite repeated reminders from the staff to do so. I noted that the accused had pleaded guilty. While this could be considered a mitigating factor, I placed little weight on the guilty plea as the breach concerned breaking curfew and he was caught “red-handed”. All things considered, I decided that the degree of severity to be at the upper end of Band 2, at 60% of 862 days (the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offence) and 517 days’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the 1st charge.

19     Next, I considered the fresh offences and the s 50T enhanced sentences for the 2 fresh offences committed by the accused, namely the 2nd charge for LT-2 drug consumption offence and the 5th charge for failing to provide urine test offence. In my judgment, the accused was a recalcitrant offender who had not been rehabilitated nor deterred by his stint in prison. The accused also faced relevant TIC charges, see \[3\] above. The principle of escalation applied, and the accused should be given an imprisonment term higher than those he previously received. Otherwise, the accused would effectively be given a sentencing discount for re-offending.

20     Accordingly, for the 2nd charge, I sentenced the accused to 7 years 6 months imprisonment, 3 months longer than the last sentence of 7 years 3 months’ imprisonment sentence. The accused was 51 years old and could not be caned pursuant to s 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Prosecution did not seek any imprisonment term in lieu of caning in the present case. For the 5th charge, I sentenced the accused to 15 months’ imprisonment, 3 months longer than the last sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. The imprisonment sentences were in line with precedents cited.

21     To decide the enhanced sentences under s50T for the above 2 fresh offences, I considered the most serious of the fresh offence first. In _Amanshah_, for the fresh LT-2 drug consumption offence punishable with s 50T enhancement sentence, he was sentenced to 7 years 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the LT-2 offence. This sentence was not in dispute at the appeal. The court held that 678 days’ imprisonment which was 5/6 of the remaining remission period of 813 days would be appropriate. The court observed that the gravity of the fresh offence, being a repeat LT-2 drug offence was moderate to high. The fresh offence was identical to the original offence of drug consumption. The fresh offence was committed less than 3 months after his release from prison. The offender’s prospects of rehabilitation were not promising. He had a string of drug-related antecedents which date all the way back to 2004, suggesting that he had not been able to rehabilitate himself.

22     While the considerations for the gravity of the offence, the repeat LT-2 offence and drug related antecedents in the present case were similar to _Amanshah_, the accused’s fresh offence was committed approximately 11 months after his release from prison, which was longer than the 3 months re-offend period in _Amanshah_. I considered the degree of severity in the present case to be lower than in _Amanshah_ as the accused had made a greater commitment to stay drug free. I indicated the starting point as 60% of the maximum 653 days (the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offence). The indicative starting point of 391 days would be appropriate. In order for the aggregate sentence under ss 50Y and 50T to not exceed the total remission period of 879 days, I reduced the enhanced sentence for the 2nd charge to 362 days. As the remaining remission period was fully rescinded, it was not necessary to consider imposing an enhanced sentence for the remaining the 5th charge.

23     With respect to the accused’s plea for leniency, it is trite law that save for very exceptional or extreme circumstances, financial hardship cannot be relied upon as a mitigating factor. See _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ \[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 406. In the present case, there were no exceptional reasons for me to reduce the sentence on this ground.

#### Aggregate Sentence

24     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions on the aggregate sentence. In the present case, the 3 charges were distinct and do not form part of a single transaction. Further, the sentence for the 1st charge and the enhanced sentence for the 2nd charge have to run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment imposed pursuant to ss 50Y(5) and 50T(5). Generally, a multiple offender who had committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence. This should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively. See _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (_“Raveen”_) at \[41\]. Public confidence in the administration of criminal justice required the court to avoid any suggestion or impression that a multiple offender may benefit from some sort of bulk discount in sentencing (_Raveen_ at \[46\]). I ordered the sentences for all 3 charges to run consecutively. As for the totality principle, taking a ‘last look’ at all the facts and circumstances of the case at hand, I considered the aggregate sentence to be proportionate to the gravity of the accused’s offences and not crushing, having regard also to his drug-related antecedents, his most recent aggregate sentence of 7 years 15 months’ imprisonment prior to the present charges, and his future prospects (_Abdul Mutalib_ at \[86\]).

25     The accused was sentenced to 7 years 21 months’ imprisonment and 517 days of imprisonment, with an enhancement of 362 days’ imprisonment. The accused was arrested on 14 October 2021 and had been in remand since then (see paragraph 30 of SOF). I ordered the sentence to take effect from 14 October 2021.
