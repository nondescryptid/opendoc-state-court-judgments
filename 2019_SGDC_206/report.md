### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

## Introduction

1       The accused pleaded guilty to the following two charges:

2       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification, and was found guilty and convicted. He further admitted to and consented for one remaining charge for the possession of utensils under s 9 of the MDA to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After hearing the parties on sentencing and mitigation, I imposed the following sentences:

> (a)     Importation charge – five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane

> (b)     Enhanced possession charge – two years’ imprisonment

4       I ordered the sentences for both charges to run consecutively. The result is a **global sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane**. The sentence was ordered to commence from 21 March 2019, the date of the accused was first remanded.

5       The accused is appealing against this sentence.

## Statement of Facts

6       The salient portions in the Statement of Facts are set out below:

7       On 23 July 2018 at about 9.30 p.m., officers from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority and the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”) stopped the accused as he was entering Singapore in a private hire car at Woodlands Checkpoint. At the material time, the accused was seated at the rear passenger seat of the car. A search was conducted of the car and the drugs exhibits (marked “A1” and “A2-1”) forming the subject matter of the importation charge was recovered from the interior fabric behind the front passenger seat. The accused was placed under arrest.

8       A1 and A2-1 were later analysed and found to contain a total of not less than 59.08 grams of Methamphetamine. The accused admitted that these drugs exhibits, which he knew contained “Ice” (a street name for Methamphetamine), were his and that he intended to bring them into Singapore.

9       Following the arrest, on 24 July 2018 at about 2.40 a.m., CNB officers conducted a search of the accused’s residence at Blk 271A Jurong West St 24 #XXX, and recovered the drug exhibit forming the subject matter of the enhanced possession charge in the accused’s bedroom. This exhibit was marked “C1”.

10     C1 was later analysed and found to contain not less than 1.03 grams of Methamphetamine.

11     The accused admitted that he knew exhibit C1 was “Ice” and that it was for his own consumption.

12     Methamphetamine is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

13     The accused had previously been convicted on 21 May 2015 for an offence of possession of a controlled drug (Methamphetamine) under s 8(a) of the MDA, and sentenced to a term of nine months’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date.

## Antecedents

14     On 5 June 2001, the accused was placed on probation for one count of criminal breach of trust.

15     On 12 January 2005, the accused was sentenced to a term of Reformative Training for one count of robbery.

16     On 23 August 2013, he was fined $1,000 for one count of gaming in public.

17     On 21 May 2015, he was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment each for two counts of possession of a controlled drug (Methamphetamine and Ketamine) under s 8(a) of the MDA, and three months’ imprisonment for one count of possession of utensils under s 9 of the MDA. Two other counts of drug possession were taken into consideration. The global sentence was a term of 12 months’ imprisonment.

18     From 2014 to 2018, the accused was also sent to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre twice.

## Mitigation

19     In mitigation, counsel for the accused shared that the accused had faced marital problems which resulted in him succumbing to the temptation of drugs which eventually led to his conviction in 2015 for drug offences. When he was released, he entered into a relationship with a Thai lady and they moved to Johor Bahru. However, their relationship was turbulent, and on the day of the offence, they had quarrelled. The accused then packed his bag and left for Singapore, before being arrested.

20     Counsel also highlighted that the accused had a very good record while in remand, and had met government officials from other countries and interacted positively with students who had visited. Counsel emphasized that his client was determined to turn over a new leaf, and that he has a supportive family to give him what he needs.

21     In oral mitigation, counsel stated that his instructions were that the drugs were for his client’s own consumption.

22     Counsel also asked for both sentences to run concurrently.

## Prosecution’s sentencing submissions

23     The Prosecution asked for a global sentence of at least seven years’ and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, with both sentences for the importation charge and the enhanced possession charge running consecutively.

24     With regard to the importation charge, the Prosecution submitted that it was appropriate to apply the sentencing framework set out for drug trafficking in _Soh Qiu Xia Katty v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 568</span> (“**_Katty Soh_**”), given that the High Court had also held in _K Saravanan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 88</span> (“**_Saravanan_**”) at \[4\] that “the overall tenor of the punishment provisions for ss 5 and 7 of the \[MDA\] is similar”, and that in practice the precedents have not drawn any distinction between the sentences imposed for drug importation and drug trafficking.

25     Extrapolating the framework in **_Katty Soh_** for the present case involving Methamphetamine, the Prosecution submitted that the following indicative sentences (for a first time offender) should apply[^1]:

26     Based on the above, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of six year’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was appropriate, as there was no reason to depart from the indicative sentence. In particular, the Prosecution asserted that the accused had not cooperated in investigations, and did not detail how he came to be in possession of the drugs and what his actual intentions were in bringing them into Singapore. The Prosecution did not accept that the accused had brought the drugs into Singapore for his own consumption, and pointed out that the amount involved (59.08g) triggered the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA.

27     With regard to the enhanced possession charge, the Prosecution accepted that the amount involved was small, and that the mandatory minimum sentence would be fair.

28     In asking for both charges to run consecutively, the Prosecution highlighted the following:

> (a)     A sentence of specific deterrence was necessary given the accused’s antecedent. The accused had committed the present offences about two years after his release from prison. The accused also seems to have moved up the scale of severity in his offending, from simple drug possession to the current importation charge.

> (b)     The two charges do not form part of the same transaction. The Methamphetamine in the enhanced possession charge clearly did not come from the same batch of drugs as the one in the importation charge.

> (c)     If both sentences run concurrently, the accused would have been given a “free pass” in respect of the enhanced possession charge.

29     Taking into account the totality principle, the Prosecution accepted that the sentence for the importation charge could be adjusted downwards to five years’ and six months’ imprisonment, therefore giving a global term of seven years’ and six months’ and six strokes of the cane.

## My decision

30     With regard to the importation charge, I agreed with the prosecution that the indicative sentences set out in the table at \[25\] above, as adapted from _Katty Soh_, applied.

31     Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal have in recent years confirmed that for the offences of drug trafficking or drug importation, the gravity of the offence is measured by the quantity of drugs involved, and that the sentence imposed should thus be proportional to the quantity in the offender’s possession. (See _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 25</span> at \[21\] and _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> at \[19\])

32      _Katty Soh_ involved the offence of drug trafficking, but I agreed with the prosecution that there was no reason why the indicative sentences there could not be adapted for use in a drug importation case as well. The High Court in _Saravanan_ accepted that the sentencing precedents did not draw a distinction between drug trafficking and drug importation cases and that the overall tenor of punishment provisions between the two offences was similar. In fact, I would highlight that the punishment structure for an importation offence under the MDA appears to be more serious, in that the maximum the court can impose for the importation of less than 167g of Methamphetamine is a term of 30 years, as opposed 20 years for a corresponding offence of trafficking. As such, the table of indicative sentences set out at \[25\] above in fact does not even utilise the full range of sentencing allowed by the law. I would therefore take the view that the indicative sentences reflected in the table would be what the accused should expect to face _at the very least_, as a starting point.

33     In the present case, the accused was found to have imported not less than 59.08 grams of Methamphetamine. This is by no means a small amount, and from the table above, it would warrant a term of at least six years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. Having considered the circumstances of the offence, I was satisfied that this starting point should apply.

34     As the Prosecution conceded, there was a dearth in details with regard to the importation charge. The Statement of Facts merely states that the accused admitted that the drugs were his and that he intended to bring them into Singapore. How he came to be in possession of these drugs, and the purpose for which he was bringing these drugs into Singapore, were unknown. The Prosecution informed the court that the accused had not been cooperative in investigations, and refused to divulge these details. This was not disputed by the accused.

35     Even in mitigation, the accused refused to explain further, but only made a bare, and rather half-hearted, assertion via his counsel that the drugs were for his own consumption. I find that difficult to accept. If the drugs had really been for his own consumption, surely this would have been one of the things he would have said during investigations. If there was a reason why he chose not to do so, he could have explained that in court during mitigation and given more details to support his assertion. He did not do so.

36     In addition, as the Prosecution pointed out, the amount involved triggered the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA, by more than double.[^2]

37     Given the above, I did not accept that the accused had imported the drugs for his own consumption.[^3] I agreed with the Prosecution, however, that the accused’s lack of cooperation with regard to the details of the offence cannot be an aggravating factor to uplift the sentence. Since I had no other details of the circumstances of the offence apart from the quantity of the Methamphetamine, I was of the view that there was no reason to depart from the indicative sentence of six years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the importation charge.

38     With regard to the enhanced possession charge, I saw no reason to depart from the mandatory minimum of two years’ imprisonment.

39     I next considered whether the sentences for each sentence should run concurrently or consecutively.

40     It was clear to me that the two charges constituted two distinct offences. The drug type was the same, but they came from two different batches. At least, the accused have not sought to explain otherwise. The purpose for the drugs in each charge was also different – the accused admitted that the drugs found in his enhanced possession charge were for his own consumption, but was silent during investigations on the purpose for the drugs in the importation charge. As I explained at \[34\] to \[37\] above, I did not accept that the drugs in the importation charge were for the accused’s consumption.

41     Given the above, and that the main sentencing principle for drug-related offences has always been that of deterrence (See _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 63</span> at \[59\]), it seemed appropriate to me to run the sentences consecutively in order to properly reflect the extent of the accused’s criminality. This was not the accused’s first run in with the law, and he had previously been incarcerated for drug offences. As the Prosecution pointed out, he appeared to have escalated his offending within about two years from the time he was released from prison. To run the sentences concurrently would lead to the unjust outcome of the accused not being punished for the enhanced possession charge. I saw no reason to afford him such a discount, especially since this was not his first drug possession offence. Such an approach did not offend the _one-transaction rule_, since the two offences were distinct.

42     However, I was also mindful of the _totality principle_ when deciding on the total sentence. In particular, I was aware that the accused was relatively young and appeared to have behaved well in remand and earned some credit for his work there. In addition, the longest term of imprisonment he had previously served was a global term of 12 months’ imprisonment.

43     In order to achieve the necessary deterrence and yet not impose a crushing sentence on the accused, I felt that the sentence for the importation charge should be tweaked downwards a little. As such I imposed the mandatory minimum term of five years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the importation charge, and ordered this charge to run consecutively with the enhanced possession charge.

44     The total sentence is that of **seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane**. I was of the view that this sentence was not “substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved” and it did not have the effect of imposing on the accused “a crushing sentence not in keeping with his record and prospects”. (_See Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> at \[54\] and \[57\])

## Conclusion

45     In all the circumstances, I was of the view that imposing on the accused a global term of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was appropriate and justified.

* * *

[^1]: I have not reflected the proposed indicative sentences for amounts of Diamorphine/Methamphetamine above 10/167 g respectively, because they are not relevant for the purposes of the present case.

[^2]: The threshold amount under s 17(h) of the MDA is 25g of methamphetamine.

[^3]: While I did not accept that the drugs were for the accused’s consumption, I did not make any positive finding with regard to the purpose he had imported the drugs. I was mindful of the fact that such a finding can only be made in the course of a Newton Hearing, which neither party requested for.
