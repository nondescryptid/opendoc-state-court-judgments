Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Taking additional evidence

30 July 2021

### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       On 8 July 2020, the High Court in Criminal Motion Nos. 43/2019, 25/2020 and 31/2020, ordered that this case be remitted to the trial judge to take further evidence pursuant to s 392(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). The High Court further directed, pursuant to s 392(4) CPC, that the trial court state the effect the additional evidence would have on its earlier verdict.

2       Three further applications by the Accused (also referred to as “the Appellant” where appropriate) in Criminal Motions Nos. 51/2020, 13/2021 and 21/2021 were made to the High Court for more additional evidence to be taken by the trial court. These were granted by the High Court separately on 22 October 2020 and 2 March 2021. Having received the additional evidence, pursuant to s 392(4) of the CPC, I now set out the effect, if any, the additional evidence has on my earlier verdict.

## The Trial

3       The Accused had been convicted by this Court on 7 September 2018 on four charges:

> ·    One charge of intentionally perverting the course of justice under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (“the Penal Code”).

> ·    Three charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code.

The Accused was sentenced on 16 January 2019 to a total sentence of imprisonment of 40 months. As the sentence was backdated to take effect from 11 November 2016, he had completed his sentence on 31 January 2019. The Appellant is currently in remand since 31 January 2019, pending the hearing of more than 400 charges of cheating and other offences scheduled to be heard in November 2021 before another trial judge in the State Courts.

4       The Accused had appealed against his convictions and sentence and the matter was fixed for appellate hearing on 18 November 2019 in the High Court. However, as mentioned above, the Appellant filed several Criminal Motions to admit additional evidence and the High Court remitted the case to the trial court to receive the additional evidence.

5       The four charges against the Accused in the trial were:

> **\[DAC 942275/2016\]**

> “You, Lim Chit Foo, on or before 1 November 2016, in Singapore, did intentionally pervert the course of justice, _to wit_, you caused one Tan Mui Shan, Stephanie, to falsely inform the police in a statement recorded on 1 November 2016 that, in respect of Productivity and Innovation Credit cash payout applications submitted by companies which the said Tan Mui Shan Stephanie was director or shareholder of, she knew that one “Wu Hai Jun” had sold computer software to these applicant companies, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

> **\[DAC 942276/2016\]**

> “You, Lim Chit Foo, on or before 1 November 2016, in Singapore, did attempt to intentionally pervert the course of justice, _to wit_, you instigated one Maurice Tan Wei Qiang to falsely inform the police that in respect of Productivity and Innovation Credit cash payout applications submitted by companies which the said Maurice Tan Wei Qiang was a director or shareholder, one “Wu Hai Jun” had instructed Maurice Tan Wei Qiang to incorporate these applicant companies, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

> **\[DAC 942278/2016\]**

> “You, Lim Chit Foo, on or before 8 November 2016, in Singapore, did attempt to intentionally pervert the course of justice, _to wit_, you instigated one Wong Kwong Weng (“Wong”), a director of Bao Tech Pte Ltd, to falsely inform the police that Wong knew that, in respect of Productivity and Innovation Credit cash payout applications submitted by applicant companies, Bao Tech Pte Ltd sold computer software to these applicant companies and Wu Hai Jun was the programmer of the said computer software, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

> **\[DAC 946998/2016\]**

> “You, Lim Chit Foo, on or before 30 October 2016, in Singapore, did attempt to intentionally pervert the course of justice, _to wit_, you instigated one Tom Lee Teng, to falsely inform the police that, in respect of a Productivity and Innovation Credit cash payout application submitted in respect of MICBO REMIX JAY PTE. LTD. (“the company”), dated 4 November 2015, which application was based on a cash purchase of Customer Relationship Management Software from Technetronic Pte Ltd, Lee had bought such software and had seen such software used in the company, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

6       The Accused was convicted of all 4 charges and sentenced to a total imprisonment term of 40 months on 16 January 2019. My reasons for the convictions and sentence are found in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chit Foo_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 48</span> (“the GD”).

## Findings on the Fresh Evidence

7       To recap, the 4 offences were committed in October and November 2016 and occurred during the investigations by IRAS (Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore) and CAD (Commercial Affairs Department) into suspected fraudulent claims made by applicant-companies under the PIC (Productivity and Innovation Credit) Scheme. Stephanie, Maurice and Tom Lee were registered directors of different applicant-companies. Wong Kwong Weng was a registered director of a few vendor-companies. Stephanie and Maurice took instructions directly from the Accused. Tom Lee was a business partner of the Accused.

8       The relevant aspects of the Fresh Evidence and my Findings on them are as follows:

> a.      _RHW1: Maurice Tan Wei Qiang_

>> i.       In the trial, Maurice Tan Wei Qiang (“Maurice”) had testified that he carried out instructions from the Accused. In this remittal hearing, Maurice testified that he knew RHW3 Tom Lee Teng (“Tom”) and had run errands, gone to the bank and delivered things for Tom’s company Stage Group Pte Ltd (“Stage”). Maurice knew the Accused was a partner of Tom in this company and had also given instructions to Maurice to do work for the company. He had helped them deliver clothing and assisted in the logistics during a concert. Tom and the Accused were also involved in another company called Micbo Remix Jay Pte. Ltd. (“MRJ”). Maurice was not involved in the business of MRJ which was in the promotion and sales of Jay Chou merchandise.

>> ii.       Maurice was shown two cheques – exhibits RH1 (OCBC cheque for $20,000) and RH2 (OCBC cheque for $49,400). Maurice testified that he saw Tom sign the cheques at the office of Stage and pass the whole cheque book to the Accused. He heard the Accused say something about having to “pay for something” but Maurice did not know what it was. Maurice testified that the Accused handed the two cheques to him in the presence of Tom. Maurice and Elsa (a staff of Stage) went to the bank and encashed the two cheques. It was printed on the cheques that they were encashed on 26 November 2015 at around 5.23pm and 5.24pm. Maurice and Elsa returned to the office of Stage with the cash and handed the cash to the Accused but Tom was not in the office at that time.

>> iii.       The DPP showed Maurice exhibit D20 (printed log of phone messages) to point out that Tom could not have been present when the Accused handed the two cheques to him. The reason being that there was a message indicating that Tom had handed over the cheques to Maggie (another staff of Stage) earlier and could not have been present when the Accused handed the cheques to Maurice. Maurice disagreed with the DPP.

>> iv.       Maurice also testified that the Accused had handed cash to Tom on the same night later at a nightclub. Maurice did not know how much cash the Accused gave to Tom.

>> v.       Maurice said that he knew of the software bought for MRJ because he was the one who deposited a cheque for payment of the software. However, he had never seen the software that was purportedly purchased by MRJ and cannot confirm that software was bought. Maurice knew that PIC claims were made to IRAS on behalf of MRJ but did not know what the PIC claims were for.

>> vi.       Maurice testified that Stephanie did not offer him money to implicate the Accused.

>> vii.       Maurice testified that Wong Kwong Weng was introduced to him by Leong Chee Liong and another person called Alan. Maurice did not use the name of Wong Kwong Weng to apply for work passes for foreign workers or to incorporate companies.

> b.      _My findings on the evidence of RHW1 Maurice_

>> i.       I had found Maurice to be a credible witness in the trial. That has not changed after this remittal hearing. Based on his evidence during the trial, I convicted the Accused of the charge in DAC 942276/2016 for instigating Maurice to say that one “Wu Hai Jun” had instructed Maurice to incorporate those applicant companies in the PIC claims made to IRAS. In truth, it was the Accused who had arranged for Maurice to incorporate those companies.

>> ii.       The two cheques – exhibits RH1 and RH2 – were issued by Tom, as the signatory for MRJ, to withdraw cash of about seventy thousand dollars ($20,000 + $49,400) from the bank account of MRJ. Maurice testified that the Accused had handed these two cheques to him in the presence of Tom. However, I agree with the DPP that the objective evidence of the phone message sent by Tom to the Accused that Tom had passed the cheques to Maggie showed that Maurice was mistaken that the two cheques were passed to him in the presence of Tom. In my view, this was an honest mistake in the light of the objective evidence and not an inconsistency on a material point.

>> iii.       As for Maurice’s testimony that Tom knew of the PIC payment for MRJ, I accept Maurice’s evidence on this point. This was not a new point as the evidence of Tom’s knowledge of the grant received by MRJ was raised in the trial and Tom was impeached on it. I had made the finding that Tom was aware of the PIC grant for MRJ. However, that did not affect my findings during the trial that Tom did not know that MRJ had bought software.

>> iv.       Tom did not buy the software and it was the Accused who had, during the telephone conversation, instigated Tom to say that Tom had bought software for MRJ. The fact of Tom having bought software is plainly untrue. If Tom had indeed bought software for MRJ or knew that MRJ had bought software, there was no necessity for the Accused to tell Tom to say that he had bought software for MRJ. The Accused’s act of telling Tom to say that he had bought software for MRJ is undeniable, based on the tele-conversation that he had with Tom.

>> v.       It is clear in my GD that the conviction of the Accused on the charge in DAC 946998/2016 was based on the recorded tele-conversation (exhibit P13) between the Accused and Tom. That was the objective evidence of the crime.

>> vi.       In view of the correction to the transcript of the tele-conversation, the charge would have to be amended to remove the reference to Tom being told to say he had seen the software being used. It is undeniable from the recorded tele-conversation that the Accused was telling Tom what to say on matters regarding the PIC claims and it was clear that the PIC claims were not submitted by Tom, although the electronic submissions to IRAS were made in Tom’s name. In the tele-conversation, the Accused even suggested to Tom that he could say that it was the vendor who might have submitted the PIC claims for Tom.

> c.      _RHW2: Tan Wei Yuan_

>> i.       RHW2 is a Commercial Affairs Officer (“CAO”) with the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force. In the remittal hearing, two affidavits of RHW2 Tan Wei Yuan (“CAO Tan”) were admitted into evidence as RH3 (affidavit dated 26 September 2019) and RH4 (affidavit dated 25 February 2021).

>> ii.       In answer to questions from the Defence Counsel (“DC”), CAO Tan testified that MRJ had received from IRAS a payment of $49,432.80 based on a PIC application dated 4 November 2015. One of the items of claim in that application was for a Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) software bought from Technetronic for $81,000. The payment by IRAS was for about 60% of the amount of $81,000 MRJ had purportedly paid for the CRM software and some other items of smaller value.

>> iii.       CAO Tan confirmed that CAD had received the cheque images from OCBC on 16 May 2017.

>> iv.       Questions were asked by the DC on whether CAO Tan had recorded statements from witnesses. The DPP objected to these questions as witness statements are generally inadmissible. The Defence Counsel did not proceed further with those questions.

>> v.       CAO Tan was asked by the counsel about police investigations involving RHW4 Bernard Ng (“Bernard”) prior to the CAD investigations into this case. CAO Tan testified that exhibit RH7 (ACRA profile search result) showed that Bernard was either a director or shareholder of the companies listed in RH7.

>> vi.       CAO Tan was also asked about Wong Kwong Weng and he confirmed that Wong Kwong Weng had died on 27 August 2018 in the house of RHW5 Leong Chee Liong. After CAO Tan was informed of the death of Wong Kwong Weng, he was made aware of a police report made by Wong Kwong Weng on 19 August 2018, nine days before his untimely death.

>> vii.       CAO Tan testified that he had not been able to access the website mentioned by the Accused in his message to Tom. According to the Accused’s message to Tom, the URL was supposed to point to the CRM software bought by MRJ. CAO Tan tried to access the URL on the internet but there was nothing there.

>> viii.       CAO Tan confirmed that there was no record of communications between XXX and the two phone numbers used by the Accused - XXX and XXX.

> d.      _My findings on the evidence of RHW2_

>> i.       I find that the evidence of RHW2 did not have any effect on any of the convictions against the Accused. It became obvious early in the questioning of this witness by the DC that his client was dissatisfied with the way the investigations had been conducted and had wanted the counsel to suggest that the investigator had less than pure motives in his investigations. I did not allow the counsel to pursue this line of questioning and reminded him to keep within the remit of the directions from the High Court for the remittal hearing.

>> ii.       There was one area of concern which the counsel dwelt on. The counsel insisted that the failure of CAO Tan to prove that there was no CRM software was fatal to their charge for instigating Tom to say that he had bought software for MRJ. In my view, that is a red herring to distract from the gravamen of the instigation charge. Whether software was bought for MRJ might be relevant to a Cheating charge but if Tom had not bought any software for MRJ, it is a falsehood for Tom to tell the investigative authorities that he had bought such a software.

>> iii.       For the Accused to instigate Tom to say something that is false or untrue on a matter under investigations, it is an act of trying to mislead the investigative authorities. Such a falsehood could mislead investigators and possibly alter the course of investigations into allegations of fraudulent conduct. At the very least, it would have created a false premise that would misdirect the investigators.

>> iv.       The testimony of RHW2 and the additional evidence of exhibits RH3 and RH4 in the remittal hearing had no effect on the verdict for the trial.

> e.      _RHW3: Tom Lee Teng_

>> i.       Tom was shown the two cheques - RH1 and RH2. It was put to him by DC that he had signed these two cheques in the presence of the accused. Tom disagreed as he had signed blank cheques and handed them over to Maggie, an admin staff in their company.

>> ii.       Tom agreed with DC that the Accused had mentioned the buying of software but Tom was not sure of the details. Tom said that he was not aware of the details as he was not the one who bought the software.

>> iii.       As for the messages between Tom and the Accused on working out their respective shares of the PIC pay-outs, Tom explained that it was a complicated computation for which Tom did not really reply to the Accused in the messages.

>> iv.       On the latest amended transcript and translations of the tele-conversation found in P13, Tom confirmed that the Accused did not tell him to say that he had seen the software being used in the office. Instead, based on the corrected transcript and translation (RH5), the Accused had told Tom to say that he had not seen the software being used in the office.

> f.      _My findings on the evidence of RHW3_

>> i.       It was obvious from the testimony of Tom in the trial, and I had already made that finding in the trial, that Tom is not a credible witness. He was often evasive and prevaricating in his evidence. He would only confirm details if they were shown to him to be incontrovertible.

>> ii.       The reason for the reticence of Tom is not difficult to fathom. Tom is a potential accomplice, whether explicitly or implicitly, in the alleged scam of PIC claims involving his company Stage and MRJ. The messages exchanged between Tom and the Accused showed that Tom was aware of the PIC claims and might have benefitted from the payments from IRAS.

>> iii.       In the remittal hearing, when asked about the computation by the Accused of Tom’s share in the PIC pay-outs, Tom was not able to give any coherent or cogent response to the DC.

>> iv.       Having said that, it is also clear that it was the Accused who was actively involved in the PIC claims even though the Accused was not a registered director or shareholder of the companies.

>> v.       Regardless of the exact extent of the roles of the Accused and Tom in the two companies generally and in the PIC claims specifically, the messages between them and the recorded tele-conversation showed beyond a shadow of doubt that Tom looked to the Accused for answers to be provided to the investigators on matters related to the PIC claims.

>> vi.       And one of the answers which the Accused provided to Tom to tell the investigators was that Tom had bought software for MRJ.

>> vii.       As for the part of the charge which stated that the Accused had asked Tom to say that he had seen the software being used in the office, now that the transcript and translation had been corrected to reflect that the Accused had told Tom to say that he had not seen the use of the software in the office, this particular of the charge would have to be deleted.

>> viii.       The evidence of Tom on the fresh evidence did not affect the verdict reached by me after trial except that there is now the need to amend the charge in DAC 946998/2016 by deleting the reference to the Accused telling Tom to say that he had seen the use of the software in the office.

> g.      _RHW4: Bernard Ng Wee Khuan_

>> i.       In the trial, Bernard Ng Wee Khuan (“Bernard”) was called by the Prosecution as PW2 to testify that he had sold a phone with the telephone number of XXX to the accused. Bernard was the registered subscriber of the phone number XXX. This phone number was the one Wong Kwong Weng had communicated with his “boss” who had wanted Wong Kwong Weng to give false statements to the police in relation to the PIC claims.

>> ii.       In the remittal hearing, Bernard was confronted with a police statement (exhibit RH12) he had given in which he stated that he had sold a telephone with the number XXX to one “Dong Ge”. Bernard’s explanation was that he might have been confused when he gave the police statement as he had sold too many phones at that time. However, he was certain he had sold to the Accused a phone number ending with ‘XXX3335’ as that was the number of a car of the Accused.

> h.      _My findings on the evidence of RHW4_

>> i.       I find that RHW4 was not able to give a satisfactory explanation as to why he had given inconsistent statements as to who he had sold the phone with the number XXX. Therefore, his evidence at trial that he had sold a phone with this number to the Accused must be treated with circumspect.

>> ii.       Nevertheless, I agree with the DPP’s submissions that Bernard’s ability or inability to confirm who he had sold the phone to is not fatal to the allegation that the Accused was the ‘boss’ who had communicated with Wong Kwong Weng and instigated Wong Kwong Weng to tell falsehoods to the police.

>> iii.       The conclusion that the Accused was the ‘boss’ referred to by Wong Kwong Weng was not based solely on Bernard’s evidence but a combination of his testimony and those of Stephanie, Maurice and Wong Kwong Weng, as well as the context and content of those messages which pointed to the Accused being the ‘boss’.

>> iv.       The doubt cast on Bernard having sold the phone with the number XXX to the Accused did not mean that the accused was not the ‘boss’ who gave instructions to Wong Kwong Weng via that number. What is required, is for us to look at the totality of the evidence, bearing in mind that Bernard’s evidence that he sold the phone with that number to the Accused can no longer be relied upon, to see if the Prosecution had proved its case.

>> v.       As it stands, Bernard’s evidence cannot be relied upon to prove who he had sold the number to. That is not fatal to the conviction on that charge. Removing that would not displace the weight of the evidence against the Accused being the ‘boss’. Bernard’s equivocal testimony, as to who he had sold the number to, did not amount to a reasonable doubt. For the detailed reasons I had given in the GD from Paragraph 18 to 39, there was still more than sufficient proof adduced by Prosecution to sustain the conviction. Only the reason given in Paragraph 36 of the GD in relation to Bernard’s evidence has been impugned.

> i.      _RHW5: Leong Chee Liong_

>> i.       RHW5 Leong Chee Liong (“Leong”) was not a witness in the original trial. He is not involved in or related to any of the charges against the Accused. At the time of the remittal hearing Leong was serving sentence for the offence of drug trafficking.

>> ii.       Leong is a witness called for the remittal hearing to testify about certain matters related to Wong Kwong Weng (“Wong”). The Accused was convicted on the charge in DAC 942278/2016 for an attempt to pervert the course of justice by instigating Wong to give false information to the police. Wong was Witness PW6 in the original trial and had since passed away. At this remittal hearing, Leong testified that he was a friend of Wong. Leong knew Wong through the introduction of Leong’s late younger brother Leong Chee Cheong.

>> iii.       Wong had passed away at Leong’s house on 6 September 2018. Wong had stayed over at Leong’s house for two days during which time they had taken drugs together. Leong had found Wong unconscious in the bathroom and he called the police.

>> iv.       Leong testified that he had found in a room of his house a police report made by Wong. This police report was lodged by Wong on 17 August 2018. After finding the report, Leong did not hand it over to the police. Instead, Leong passed it to the lawyer for the Accused. (DC Bachoo Mohan Singh clarified that his law firm BMS Law LLC had acted for Leong in the drug trafficking case against Leong. Leong had sent a photo of the police report via phone message (exhibit RH14) to a lawyer in DC’s firm by the name of Lee Ji Yen.)

>> v.       When questioned by the DPP on why he had sent the photo of Wong’s police report to the lawyer for the Accused, Leong said that he wanted the lawyer to help him recover insurance money from O2O which was a company that his late brother was a director of. Leong said that he had received a letter stating that there was insurance money, however he did not know the details. Leong said that he first came to know of the Accused’s law firm through the CAD. He was informed that the lawyer for the Accused wanted to interview him.

>> vi.       Leong was shown exhibits RH8-1 to RH8-16. These were handwritten notes of unconfirmed authorship handed over to the police by the mother of Wong after his death.

>> vii.       Leong testified that in August 2018, two to three weeks before Wong’s death, he had stayed over at Wong’s house for two days. He had brought over to Wong’s house copies of his drug charges preferred against him by CNB (referring to the Central Narcotics Bureau) to show Wong’s sister who was a lawyer. Twelve (12) pages of the sixteen 16) sheets of the handwritten notes were written on the back of these CNB documents. The rest of the four handwritten notes were written on the back of copies of the Moneylenders Act. Leong did not know where these copies of the Moneylenders Act came from as he did not bring them to the house of Wong, and he was not charged with offences under the Moneylenders Act.

>> viii.       Leong testified that he had written RH8-6, RH8-7 and RH-10. He was not able to confirm exactly who had written the rest of the handwritten notes although he had seen Wong write some of them. Leong did not read what was written by Wong.

>> ix.       Leong said that RH8-6 and RH8-7 were written by him after he and Wong had made an audio-recording together. He wanted to write down what was said to see if he had missed out anything when they made the recording. Leong said that they had made the recording to let Stephanie listen to it.

>> x.       On the purpose of making the audio-recording, Leong said that it was because Stephanie promised to give money to his younger brother and Wong money but had stopped paying after a few months.

>> xi.       On why they had to record the same dialogue three times in the recording, Leong said that they had to repeat recording because the quality of the recording was poor as they were high on drugs.

>> xii.       Leong agreed that what was written on RH8-6 and Rh8-7 were actually the script of a dialogue which he and Wong were trying to act out. However, he disagreed that they were written before the recording.

>> xiii.       As for RH8-10, Leong testified that he had copied the words from police statements shown to him by Wong. He selected the important parts of the statements to copy. To Leong, the important parts are the parts concerning giving Wong money.

>> xiv.       Upon further questioning by the DPP, Leong testified that he was concerned that he had been implicated for the incorporation of companies involved in PIC claims and the borrowing of money from banks. Leong said that he was only involved in the incorporation of companies to do with labour-supply.

>> xv.       Leong was shown RH15 which is an affidavit of a CAD investigator filed with the High Court in relation to an application for bail by the Accused. Leong confirmed that he had copied the third paragraph on RH8-10 from Paragraph 9 of the affidavit RH15. Leong also confirmed that he had copied the fourth paragraph on RH8-10 from Paragraph 10 of the affidavit RH15.

>> xvi.       The DPP referred Leong to a phone message he had sent to the mother of Wong on 10 September 2018 (admitted as RH17). In the message, Leong had asked her to retrieve some papers and a voice recorder that Leong had left in the house of Wong. Leong testified that he wanted the recorder so that he could let Stephanie listen to it.

>> xvii.       The DPP applied to impeach the credit of Leong on his inconsistent statement given to CAD. In court, Leong testified that he did not know Chester before meeting him in prison. He did not know that Chester was the same person known to him as “M” or “Jimmy” until he was told by CAD that Chester was “M”. Leong also testified that he did not know Chester as “Jay”. However, in a statement (exhibit RH18) given to CAD on 1 February 2017, Leong mentioned that Chester is “Ah-Jay” and Chester is also known by many names, including “Jimmy”. Leong had also confirmed in that statement to CAD that XXX was Chester’s telephone number.

> j.      _My findings on the evidence of RHW5_

>> i.       Leong was not a witness in the original trial. The relevance of his testimony at the remittal hearing concerned what he knew from the discovery of a police report lodged by Wong on 17 August 2018 (exhibit RH14), a stack of handwritten notes (RH8-1 to RH8-16) and a series of audio recordings (RH13).

>> ii.       After an evaluation of these exhibits RH8-1 to RH8-16, RH13 (including RH13T-P and RH13-D) and RH14, I find that these exhibits must be seen in totality for their significance to be understood.

>> iii.       The first thing to note about the 16 sheets of RH8-1 to RH8-16 is that they are not arranged in a proper sequence. Only exhibit RH8-1 and RH8-2 are in a sequential order by virtue of its contents and the indicated numbering. Other than Leong’s confirmation that he had written RH8-6, RH8-7 and RH8-10, there is no confirmation who had written the rest of the notes. Leong only testified that he had seen Wong writing some of the notes but he did not see what Wong had written.

>> iv.       A careful perusal of 13 of the 16 sheets of handwritten notes (that is to say, excluding the RH8-6, RH8-7 and RH8-10 written by Leong) would show that there are at least two different handwriting styles indicative of the handwritings of more than one person. There are apparently more than 3 different handwritings on these 16 sheets of handwritten notes of which 3 sheets were admitted by Leong to be his.

>> v.       A careful reading of the 16 sheets of handwritten notes in general and the notes written by Leong in RH8-6 and RH8-7 (admitted by Leong to be a post-written script for the audio recording) in particular, together with the police report made by Wong on 17 August 2018 and the actual audio recordings, revealed that there was an attempt for Leong and Wong to create the impression that Stephanie had paid Wong to cast all blame on the Accused as the mastermind behind the fraudulent PIC claims.

>> vi.       Most of the handwritten notes contained names and details of people involved in the setting up of companies for fraudulent purposes and information on the purported roles of named persons including Stephanie (or Zining), Maurice, Wong and Leong Chee Liong (referred to simply as “liong” in the notes) and various telephone numbers including XXX and XXX (see RH8-16).

>> vii.       Although a reading of the notes could not provide an exact picture of what and why they were written, there were instructions to produce a recording of some sort (refer to RH8T translation of RH8-3 which stated that the recording must be of good quality).

>> viii.       There were also clear references for Wong to make a report to be handed over to lawyers (refer to RH8-3 which stated “Wong report. It would be best for all documents to be communicated lawyer to lawyer, it is only then will the documents be verified and legitimate, officially delivered to my lawyer. Because Wong is DPP’s witness. You, Liong, yourself no problem.”)

>> ix.       There is in RH8-3 the following: “Liong: Lawyer saw you is to understand your case and my matter. I mentioned the matter I discussed with you. Lawyer said so long as these matters concerning Wong car, Zining etc. were real “truth”, it would be alright. (You go and confirm with lawyer.)” This seemed to suggest that it was written by the Accused to Leong giving him instructions on what to do, after making references to his lawyer having seen Leong.

>> x.       Once the true purport of the handwritten notes is appreciated, it becomes clear why Leong was desperate to retrieve the notes from Wong’s house.

>> xi.       I found Paragraph 54 of the submissions of the DPP for the remittal hearing to be a succinct summary of the significance of RH8-10 which calls into question the credibility of RHW5 as a witness.

>> xii.       I find that the evidence of RHW5 Leong Chee Liong did not cast doubt on the conviction of the Accused for the charge involving Wong. On the contrary, I found the documentary evidence and the audio-recording fortified my verdict that the Accused had intended to pervert the course of justice and continued to attempt to do so while in remand. The evidence adduced in the course of the remittal hearing showed why the Accused was rightly refused bail.

> k.      _RHW6: Stephanie Tan Mui Shan_

>> i.       RHW6 Stephanie Tan Mui Shan was a key witness in the trial. She had worked closely under the Accused and admitted that she had falsely informed the police in her statement (P2) to CAD on 1 November 2016 that she knew that one “Wu Hai Jun” had sold computer software to companies in which she was a director or shareholder.

>> ii.       In this remittal hearing, Stephanie testified that it was Leong who had recruited Wong to be a nominee director of the company Techne Engineering Pte Ltd (“Techne”). She confirmed that she had brought Wong to the bank. She also confirmed that Leong was made nominee director of several companies and she had also brought him to the bank. She testified that so long as the Accused instructed her, she would do the necessary paperwork to register them as directors and open bank accounts. As for the aspect of remuneration, it was discussed between the Accused and Leong.

>> iii.       Stephanie was asked about the police report lodged by Wong on 17 August 2018 (exhibit RH14) in which he had alleged that Stephanie would pay Wong money if he were to push the blame regarding the PIC fraud on the Accused. Stephanie denied the allegation.

>> iv.       Stephanie was also shown the handwritten notes RH8-1 to RH8-16. She denied the allegations in these notes suggesting that she had offered Wong money to implicate the Accused.

> l.      _My findings on the evidence of RHW6_

>> i.       The testimony of RHW6 Stephanie did not have any effect on the convictions and verdict at trial. Her evidence was consistent with her testimony at trial that she had taken instructions from the Accused. She did not offer money to Wong to implicate the Accused in the fraudulent claims under the PIC Scheme.

>> ii.       Stephanie’s evidence in the remittal hearing cast doubt on the credibility of RHW5 Leong as she testified that Leong knew the Accused and had similarly taken instructions from the Accused for the opening of bank accounts as nominee directors of companies involved in the PIC fraud.

> m.      _RHW7: Ho Muhammad Nur_

>> i.       RHW7 Ho Muhammad Nur (“Nur”) was not a witness in the trial. At the remittal hearing, Nur testified that he was offered some money to be registered as a director of Stage and to sign the facility application form for a bank loan. Nur was made a director of Stage on 2 January 2013 as shown in exhibit RH19. Nur had also signed on a bank loan facility document exhibit RH20 dated 18 November 2015 as the director of Stage.

>> ii.       RH20 was an application form for a bank loan of $197,000 for Stage. Nur was not expected to repay any loan taken and he would declare bankruptcy if the bank went after him for the default of any loan repayment.

>> iii.       In the loan application form, the contact number of Nur was written as XXX. Nur did not fill up the form and had no idea who had done it. Nur did not have any phone with the number XXX and did not know whose number it was. The loan document was signed by him when it was brought to him. He did not go to the bank to sign it.

>> iv.       Nur had never met the Accused and had only dealt with a person called “Yusri”.

> n.      _My findings on the evidence of RHW7_

>> i.       In the trial, Nur was mentioned by the Accused in his phone messages with Tom to be the person who had taken over the directorship of Stage from Tom. At this remittal hearing, the Accused tried to distance himself from Nur. It was a dismal attempt as it was inconsistent with his message to Tom.

>> ii.       The evidence of Nur did not have any effect on the convictions and verdict arrived at in the trial. Nur had no clue about the number XXX.

> o.      _RHW8: Vera Tay Su Seah_

>> i.       RHW8 Vera Tay is an assistant manager from M1 and she was a formal witness called to admit the call logs of phone numbers XXX and XXX of subscriber Bernard Ng Wee Khuan, XXX of subscriber Logiswift Pte Ltd, of which Bernard Ng Wee Khuan was a director and shareholder.

>> ii.       As RHW8 was a formal witness, there was nothing in her testimony which was directly relevant to the case.

> p.      _RHW9: Lim Chit Foo – the Accused_

>> i.       RHW9 is the Accused. At the remittal hearing, his evidence was mainly on the cheques RH1 and RH2, the telephone number XXX and the tele-conversation he had with Tom in the light of the amended transcript of the recording.

>> ii.       The Accused claimed, in the remittal hearing as well as the trial, that XXX was used by one “Lao Song”. The Accused also claimed that the “Dong Ge” referred to by Bernard should be “Song Ge” and is referring to the same person “Lao Song”.

>> iii.       As for the cheques RH1 and RH2, the Accused said that the cheques were issued by Tom. The Accused said that this showed that Tom was aware of the PIC claim as well as the buying of the software for MRJ. The Accused claimed that he had given $20,000 to Maurice as the money for the software for MRJ to be deposited into the bank account of Wu Hai Jun.

>> iv.       On the tele-conversation forming the basis of the charge involving the instigation of Tom, the Accused clarified that the “you” in “You had previously bought the software” in relation to the buying of software referred to the company MRJ and not to Tom. The Accused was also confronted by the DPP as to the change in position from his affidavit (exhibit RH29) in the High Court (for his application to adduce evidence) from saying that he told Tom to say that he (the Accused) had bought software to his position at this remittal hearing to say that the company had bought software. The Accused said that he had been confused and misled by the Prosecution.

>> v.       The Accused was questioned by the DPP on how he became acquainted with Leong in prison and how the subject of the police report made by Wong came up. The Accused was not able to give a definitive answer as to how he came to know that the police report by Wong would be helpful to his defence and why Wong would make such a report.

>> vi.       On the witness Nur, the Accused claimed that it was Danny who had found him to take over Stage from Tom. The Accused said that Danny was Nur’s boss. The Accused was asked by the DPP why he had remained as a signatory to the bank account of Stage, after Nur had been appointed as a director and added as a signatory, when he claimed that he did not know Nur and how he became a director and signatory to the company’s bank account. The Accused became evasive and did not answer the DPP’s question.

>> vii.       When his counsel asked him to clarify, the Accused still did not provide an explanation but gave an astonishing revelation that Danny said that he wanted to use the company to take up fraudulent loans.

>> viii.       On the decision to make a PIC claim for MRJ, the Accused was asked who had decided to do so – Tom or the Accused. His answer was that the both of them had decided to make the claim. The Accused added that they had not bought the software yet before making the claim, but that it was an intended purchase. If their claim was not successful, they wouldn’t buy the software. When asked again by the DPP as to who had decided to submit the claim based on an intended purchase of software, the Accused pointed to Tom, saying that Tom was the company’s only boss.

> q.      _My findings on the evidence of RHW9_

>> i.       On the telephone number XXX, the Accused maintained that he did not use this number. This was the same position he had taken during the trial. The Accused’s evidence on this point remained the same and did not have any effect on the verdict.

>> ii.       On the use of the word “you” in the phone conversation with Tom in relation to the buying of software, the Accused had come up with a new interpretation which was not canvassed during the trial. In the remittal hearing, the Accused put forth his version that the “you” referred to the company and not to Tom. This was simply an afterthought and there was no basis to justify such an interpretation. The Accused went even further with his new interpretation by claiming that the company being referred to was Stage and not MRJ. There was no new evidence to point to this new interpretation proffered by the Accused and I rejected it. This is just another example of the Accused prevaricating in his evidence at trial and now in the remittal hearing.

>> iii.       As for the second part of the charge touching on whether the Accused told Tom to say that he had seen the software being used, it is now established as a fact that this is incorrect. Therefore, the charge would have to be amended to delete this aspect.

>> iv.       On how the Accused came to know of the police report lodged by Wong and why Leong would hand over the report to his lawyer, the Accused was evasive and not able to provide any explanation. This aspect of the Accused’s evasiveness was consistent with how the Accused had testified in the trial whenever he was confronted with adverse evidence.

>> v.       The Accused’s testimony at the remittal hearing on the payment of $20,000 to Wu Hai Jun unknowingly revealed a conundrum for the Accused. The PIC application was meant to partially cover payments made to vendors and these were payments already incurred by the applicant companies. It seemed that the Accused is admitting to having defrauded IRAS and splitting the windfall with Tom.

>> vi.       In any event, the conviction in relation to Tom was for instigating Tom to give false information to the investigative authorities. The fact that Tom knew of the PIC claim, genuine or otherwise, did not detract from the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice in this case. I had already made the finding at the end of the trial that Tom knew of the PIC claim on behalf of MRJ.

## Summary of the Evaluation and Effect of the Fresh Evidence on each of the 4 convicted charges

9       The evidence adduced at the trial was considered in its totality. Likewise, the additional evidence adduced in the remittal hearing must be viewed holistically to be appreciated and assessed properly.

### The Charge in relation to Wong Kwong Weng

10     In the trial, the Accused claimed to be totally ignorant of the person Wong Kwong Weng (“Wong”). Yet, in the remittal hearing, we have a police report by Wong and a stack of handwritten notes, some of which were purportedly written by Wong, that suggested that it was not the Accused but Stephanie who was the mastermind. So, from a position of claiming that the Accused is not the person referred to as “Boss”, the Defence seemed to have changed to one of the Accused being referred to as the “Boss” but that it was all a set-up by Stephanie.

11     In my view, the police report (RH14) made by Wong on 17 August 2018, the audio-recordings and the stack of handwritten notes were _prima facie_ evidence of fabrication of evidence to exonerate the Accused. The notes painted a picture, albeit a sketchy picture, of an attempt to incriminate Stephanie of framing the Accused by lodging a police report and providing a “good” recording. Moreover, in order to ensure a veneer of legitimacy to the process, there was even a suggestion in the notes to involve the use of lawyers.

12     In the event that I am wrong in my view of the reason for the police report and the audio-recording and reading too much into the sketchy picture painted by the handwritten notes, these additional evidence certainly did not provide any basis to cast doubt on the conviction of the charge against the Accused in relation to Wong.

13     As for the telephone number XXX, although the evidence of Bernard did put into question whether Bernard had sold it to the Accused, it did not rule it out. As I had not based my trial finding that the Accused was the “boss” in the communication with Wong solely on the evidence of Bernard, but on the overall assessment of all the witnesses including Stephanie, Maurice and Wong, as well as the context and content of those messages pointing to the Accused, the conclusion that the Accused was “boss” is still sound. Furthermore, the evidence of Nur and his involvement in the company Stage for fraudulent bank loans raises the spectre of suspicion on the Accused of being involved in other nefarious activities. The Accused remained as the signatory of the bank account for Stage together with Nur. The number of XXX was also used in the fraudulent bank loan application form.

### The Charge in relation to Maurice

14     There was absolutely nothing in the fresh evidence that had any effect on the conviction for the charge against the Accused in relation to Maurice. In fact, as pointed out by the Prosecution, Maurice’s evidence that he had always acted on the instructions of the Accused in the trial was confirmed in this remittal hearing.

### The Charge in relation to Stephanie

15     Similarly, for the charge against the Accused in relation to Stephanie, the additional evidence did not have any adverse effect on the conviction arrived at trial. If anything, the attempted incrimination of Stephanie by Wong and Leong served to demonstrate the lengths to which the Accused would go to exonerate himself. The only beneficiary of the actions taken by Leong and Wong before Wong’s demise was the Accused. After Wong’s death, Leong was anxious to retrieve the handwritten notes from Wong’s house.

### The Charge in relation to Tom

16     The instigation of Tom by the Accused was proved by way of a voice recording of a tele-conversation between Tom and the Accused. There were two aspects to his instigation – that Tom had bought the software and that Tom had seen the use of the software. The only effect of the fresh evidence at the remittal hearing was to make it necessary to amend the charge by deleting the second aspect of the instigation. That is, in view of the fresh transcript of what could be heard and the translation that now clarified that the Accused told Tom to say that he had not seen the software.

17     I have rejected the Accused’s latest attempt to interpret the “You” in “You bought software” to refer to the company instead of referring to Tom. I found that he had been caught out by his own lies when the DPP confronted him with his affidavit made in his application to the High Court to adduce fresh evidence, in which the Accused asserted that the “You” was referring to himself. This was a clear case of the Accused tailoring his evidence to suit his purposes.

18     Other than having to delete the 2nd part of the instigation stated in the charge, the fresh evidence did not have any other effect on the conviction of the charge against the Accused in relation to Tom.

## Conclusion

19     From the above findings on the fresh evidence adduced at the remittal hearing, I was satisfied that the additional evidence did not have any adverse effect on the verdict of conviction I had arrived on the 4 charges proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As I had said in the GD, we need to scrutinize the evidence carefully and at the same time, we need to stand back and see what was really going on.
