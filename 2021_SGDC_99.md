\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9892/2020/01.

31 May 2021

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a 23-year-old Malaysian, pleaded guilty to a charge of cross border movement of cash without giving a report to an authorised officer, an offence under s 48C(1) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed)(“the Act”).

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly.

3       The Accused also faced two other charges of the same offence. He admitted to the two charges. He gave his consent to have these two charges taken into consideration (“the TIC charges”) for the purpose of sentencing.

4       After having carefully considered the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation and address on sentence, I granted the Accused a 12 months’ conditional discharge. I gave a warning to the Accused that should he commit any offence during this period, he would be brought back to this Court to be sentenced for the offence.

5       The Prosecution was dissatisfied with the conditional discharge order. The Prosecution filed an appeal against it.

## Statement of Facts

6       The SOF is reproduced in full below:

> **Parties**

> 1.    The complainant is Dickson Tay, an ICA Officer holding the rank of Sergeant.

> 2.    The accused is Amir Shah Bin Sarfudeen (Passport Number XXX, FIN XXX) a 23-year-old male Malaysian, residing at 14 Nusa Idama, Johor Bahru. He works as a delivery attendant delivering food to Mandai and Tuas Dormitory in Singapore.

> **Facts Pertaining to DAC-921312-2020**

> 3.    On 25 August 2020 at about 11 p.m., Sergeant Dickson was stationed at the Tuas Checkpoint Arrival Cargo Zone 5. His role was to conduct checks on vehicles coming to Singapore from Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

> 4.    On the same day at about 11.53 p.m., Sergeant Dickson perform checks on a Malaysia registered vehicle, JLG1199. The accused was one of the passengers in the vehicle.

> 5.    Upon opening the passenger side door of the vehicle, Sergeant Dickson saw a red bag and a black plastic bag were on the floor of the passenger side seat unconcealed where the accused was seated at.

> 6.    Sergeant Dickson and members of his team searched the bags and found that they contained:

>> a.    MYR50,199 (SGD16,475.31);

>> b.    EUR300,000 (SGD484,980); and

>> c.    SGD230,000.

> 7.    The driver and a second passenger claimed ownership to MYR35,000 of the MYR50,199 which was part of their salary which was handed over to them by their employer before coming to Singapore.

> 8.    The remaining amount (of SGD719,968.31) was in the accused’s possession for the purpose of him safekeeping it for his employer, Mohamed Abubacker, who ordinarily resides in Johor Bahru. Abubacker had passed the accused the money on 23 August 2020 for safekeeping, with instructions for it to be given to one Ravin for the purpose of starting a business. Abubacker was unable to do so himself as his wife, who was in Kuala Lumpur, had some medical issues and he had to travel there to be with her.

> 9.    The accused therefore kept the monies and brought it into Singapore with him for safekeeping as he embarked on his delivery route, not wishing to leave the monies in his home in Malaysia given that he resided in shared accommodation there.

> 10.    The accused had therefore moved into Singapore cash of EUR300,000, SGD230,000 and MYR15,199 (total value equivalent to SGD719,968.31) without reporting the said movement to the authorities in accordance with s 48C(1) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation and Benefits) Act (‘CDSA’) and has thereby committed an offence under s 48C(2) of the CDSA.

7       The account given in the SOF relates to the third occasion in which the Accused has failed to report the money he was then carrying when he came into Singapore. The facts concerning the first and second occasions which he had failed to make the requisite report can be obtained from the two TIC charges, which I have summarised in the table below:

## Antecedent

8       The Accused does not have any criminal antecedent.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

9       The Prosecution sought the imposition of a fine of $10,000. In support, the Prosecution submitted a Table of Sentencing Precedents where six cases involving the commission of the same offence were briefly stated. In these six cases, fines ranging from $8000 to $15,000 per charge were imposed. The Prosecution’s only contention was that the proposed fine of $10,000 was in accordance with these case precedents after considering the amount of money the Accused was carrying and the frequency of his trips.

10     I have observed that five out of the six cases that the Prosecution has referred to do not have any written grounds of decision. The only case with a written decision is that of _Luyono Lam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 37</span> (“_Luyono_”), a copy of which was provided in the Defence’s Plea-in-Mitigation. The Prosecution did not discuss _Luyono_ when making its submission on sentence. I shall return to _Luyono_ in these grounds of decision later (see \[15\] and \[24\] to \[26\] below).

## Defence’s Plea-in-Mitigation and Address on Sentence

### Mitigation plea

11     The Defence gave a brief backdrop to the case from the Accused’s perspective. The Accused lived in a rented room in Johor Bahru. The room is shared by five other persons. The Accused worked for one Abubacker who owned a Bistro business. Due to a drastic decline in the business, Abubacker arranged for the Accused to work as a food delivery attendant in a food delivery business owned by one Ravindran. Abubacker and Ravindran are friends. Arising from this arrangement, the Accused travelled to Singapore daily to deliver food to dormitories. The Accused was entrusted with the money, comprising S$230,000 and EUR 300,000, by Abubacker. He was told by Abubacker to await his instruction to pass the money to Ravindran.

12     The Accused was concerned about safety of the money. He did not wish to leave the money in his shared room while he was away for work. He therefore carried the money with him when he came to Singapore to deliver food.

13     On the third occasion (which is the subject matter of the proceeded charge), an additional sum of MYR 50,199 was involved. The said sum of money was the combined salaries of the Accused and two others, namely, the driver of the vehicle JLG1199 and the other delivery attendant. They were given their salaries shortly before they embarked on a delivery trip to Singapore.

14     The Defence thus submitted that the Accused was merely safekeeping the money (_i.e._ S$230,000 and EUR 300,000) for Abubacker, and the Accused did not carry the three set of currencies (_i.e._ S$230,000, EUR 300,000 and MYR 50,199) to be used in Singapore.

15     In _Luyono_ at \[13\], the High Court considered the objective of Part VIA of the Act which comprises ss 48A to 48G. The objective was clearly stated in s 48A and it is “_for the purpose of detecting, investigating and prosecuting drug trafficking offences and serious offences.”_ Part VIA was to enhance the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures. The very object of such a regime was to serve as a tool to detect and prevent such insidious criminal syndicates or terrorists from using our financial system for their own illicit purposes. The Defence submitted that the investigation has shown that the Accused did not engage in any criminal activities. Relying on _Luyono_, the Defence submitted that the Accused is not one of those persons targeted by the reporting regime of the Act.

16     The Defence argued that the Accused’s case was one of those exceptional situations similar to _Public Prosecutor v Loh Hua Boon_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 63</span> (“_Loh Hua Boon_”). In _Loh Hua Boon_, the offender returned to Singapore from Malaysia using the Tuas Checkpoint. The offender had S$46,000 cash with him. On his entry into Singapore, the offender failed to submit a cash declaration report. It was explained in mitigation that the offender had inadvertently brought the money into Malaysia in the morning when he brought his mother to visit his aunt’s husband. He had thereafter returned to Singapore in the afternoon with the money. He had no purpose or intention to bring the money over to Malaysia. The prosecution did not challenge the offender’s mitigation. The District Judge granted a conditional discharge to the offender. The prosecution appealed against the conditional discharge order. After the District Judge’s grounds of decision were released, the prosecution’s appeal lapsed.

17     The Defence informed that the Accused had co-operated fully with the authorities during investigations. The Accused was caught during the third occasion. During investigations, the Accused had voluntarily disclosed the three occasions where he had failed to report the money he had in his possession. The Defence stated that the Accused “_inadvertently believed that it is not necessary to declare the Currencies because it was not intended to be used in Singapore_.” Lastly, the Defence stated that the Accused has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity as an indication of his remorse. He has saved precious time and resources for the Court and the Prosecution.

18     The Defence’s raised two arguments in response to the Prosecution’s address on sentence. Firstly, the cases cited by the Prosecution, save for _Luyono_, were unreported decisions and that sentencing court should be slow to rely unreported decisions. The danger being that comparisons based on unreported decisions are difficult, and are likely to be misleading because a proper appraisal of the particular facts and circumstances is simply lacking: _Luong Thi Thong Hoang Kathleen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 707</span> at \[21\]. Secondly, in all the cases cited by the prosecution, the undeclared money was meant to be used in Singapore or elsewhere. But in the present case, the Accused had brought along the money with him merely to safeguard them before passing them to Ravindran in accordance with Abubacker’s instructions.

19     In conclusion, the Defence submitted that the Accused should be granted an absolute or conditional discharge.

## Court’s decision on sentence

20     It is undisputed that the Accused has fully co-operated with investigations.

21     I accepted the Defence’s argument that the Accused has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. A check of the case history revealed that the Accused was charged in court on 21 October 2020. He indicated his intention to plead guilty and the case scheduled to 18 November 2020 for the Accused’s plea to be taken. The plea was delayed because the Accused had decided to engage a lawyer. The case was adjourned to 27 November 2020 where counsel appeared to represent the Accused. On the same day, the Accused pleaded guilty to the proceeded charge.

22     I agreed with the submissions made by the Defence at \[14\] to \[16\] above. Accordingly, I found that:

> (i)     The Accused was safe keeping the money and had no intention of using them in Singapore; and

> (ii)     He is not a person targeted by the reporting regime of the Act.

>> At this stage, I would like to discuss an amendment to s 48A. Section 48A was amended in December 2018 (see Serious Crimes and Counter-Terrorism (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2018 (No. 51 of 2018)) where the following phrase “_to allow the confiscation of any physical currency or bearer negotiable instrument moved, attempted to be moved, or received, in contravention of the requirements under this Part_” was added. In our present case, the Prosecution was not relying on this particular amendment to support its case. In fact, the Prosecution informed the court that “_following these proceedings the police intend to have the sums returned to their rightful owner.”_ (See Notes of Evidence at page 17; lines 5 to 6). The Prosecution then added “_\[b\]ecause the position is to be with---for the currencies to be returned to the rightful owner, so the police are arranging for that to be done with the owner in Malaysia, there are obviously some administrative and logistical arrangements that needs to be made in respect of that. …”_. (See Notes of Evidence at page 26; lines 22 to 26). Accordingly the said amendment did not impact upon my analysis as the Prosecution, by the position indicated, did not contradict the Defence’s submission that this was not a typical case which fell squarely within the objectives as stated in s 48A (even taking into account the said amendment).

In the circumstances, I formed the indicative view that the court should be slow in imposing a fine. That said, even if a fine is to be meted, I also agreed with the Defence’s submission at \[18\] above that a sentencing court should be slow in relying on unreported case precedents.

23     I shall now deal with the Prosecution’s oral arguments.

> (a)     In its reply to the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation, the Prosecution pointed out that “_the authorities don’t know what they don’t know which is why this regime is in place so as to \[make it\] incumbent on bearers of monies to declare those sums so that the authorities can look into whether or not they are for drug trafficking or other serious offender \[sic\]…_” (see Notes of Evidence from page 14 at line 31 to page 15 at line 15). The Accused has breached the reporting requirement. This was merely stating the obvious, otherwise the Accused would not have been charged. With due respect to the Prosecution, its argument looked at the matter purely from the enforcement angle, namely, investigation and prosecution. This argument has failed to address the issue of sentence after a criminal prosecution has commenced in the courts.

> (b)     The Prosecution then raised the issue of potential harm had the money been for drug trafficking purposes. When the Court highlighted to the Prosecution that its SOF had clearly stated that the Accused was safe keeping the money for his employer, the Prosecution then conceded that on the particular facts of this case, harm was not as high as it would have been.

> (c)     The Prosecution was asked by the court to address on the culpability of the Accused. The Prosecution skirted around the issue without giving the Court an adequate answer or proper assessment. In my judgement, I have assessed the Accused’s culpability to be at the lowest end, even though I was aware that he had committed the breach on three occasions.

Concluding on this part, the Prosecution has, in my judgment, failed to raise any aggravating factor against the Accused.

24     I now turn to discuss the case of _Luyono_. In _Luyono_, the offender faced seven charges under s 48C(1) of the Act. This is the same offence faced by the present Accused. Briefly, the facts revealed that the offender was the managing director and shareholder of a money changing business in Indonesia. In May 2009, the offender arrived in Singapore and attempted to clear customs without declaring that he was carrying currencies or bearer negotiable instruments exceeding S$30,000. After his belongings were scanned by an X-ray machine, the offender was asked if he anything to declare. He denied initially. Just as the officer was about to conduct a physical check of his luggage, the offender then informed that he had cash with him. Investigations revealed that the offender was in the business of money exchange, and he had brought physical currencies and traveller’s cheques in and out of Singapore on seven occasions for the purposes of selling and exchanging them with a Singapore money changer. The offender pleaded guilty to three counts and consented to the remaining four counts to be taken into consideration. The district judge sentenced the offender was to a total of eight months’ imprisonment. On appeal, the High Court substituted the imprisonment term with a total fine of S$24,000. The High Court was aware that where the movement of cash was predicated on the offenders’ legitimate money-changing business (see _Luyono_ at \[15\]), or where cash was transported for the purposes connected with legitimate commercial transactions (see _Luyono_ at \[15\]), the courts had appropriately exercised their discretion to impose only a fine.

25     In my assessment, I found the Accused’s culpability much lower than that of the offender in _Luyono_. In my deliberation on sentence, I found the following passage from _Luyono_ at \[14\] to be instructive:

> 14…    The punishment imposed must correspond to the culpability of an offender _in the context of the objectives of the Act_ (and in this case, it must correspond in particular to the objective of Pt VIA of the Act). I also noted that Parliament had enacted an over-inclusive provision in s 48C(1) of the Act which made it an offence for a person to bring into or out of Singapore cash amounts of more than $30,000 if an appropriate declaration was not made, regardless of whether the money originated from money laundering or is intended for terrorists activities, or otherwise. It is understandable that Parliament had seen it fit to enact such an all-embracing provision in order to ensure that the Act’s objectives would be effectively met. That said, a court still has the responsibility to strike a balance between upholding the cash reporting regime and the spirit behind that provision, and mete out a sentence that fairly accounts for the over-inclusiveness of the provision in assessing culpability for the purpose of punishment.

> (Emphasis within the judgment itself).

26     I would also add the following passage from _Tan Wei v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 450</span> at \[1\]:

> 1\. ….. sentencing benchmarks and guidelines must be applied with care and sensitivity to the facts of each case. As much as consistency in sentencing is an important aspect of fairness, the court must never exercise its sentencing discretion in a purely formulaic manner. Sentencing is always fact-sensitive. The court plays the important role of tempering justice with mercy, and of making a well-rounded assessment of what would be a fair sentence on the facts of each case.

27     Having considered all the relevant sentencing factors, it was my view that this case warranted a consideration for a conditional discharge. I then applied my mind to the principles for conditional discharge. Under s 8(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed), it is provided that the court before which a person is convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of the opinion, having regard to the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate, the court may make an order discharging him subject to the condition that he commits no offence during such period, not exceeding 12 months from the date of the order. In _Kalaiarasi d/o Marimuthu Innasimuthu v Public Prosecutor_ \[2021\] 2 SLR 774 at \[23\], the High Court explained:

> On a plain reading, s 8(1) of the Act requires the court to be satisfied of three matters before ordering an absolute or conditional discharge for offenders who have attained the age of 21. First, it must be inexpedient to inflict punishment. Second, a probation order must not be appropriate. In determining whether these two requirements are satisfied, s 8(1) provides that the court is to have regard to the circumstances. Third, the offence is not one for which a specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed by law. Two circumstances in particular are underscored: the nature of the offence and the character of the offender. Section 8(1) should not, however, be read as restricting the court to only these two considerations. The word “including” in the provision makes it clear that the two specified circumstances are not exhaustive.

28     Firstly, the punishment for an offence under s 48C(1) of the Act is not fixed by law as it is punishable by a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both. There is thus no legal impediment in granting a conditional discharge.

29     Secondly, it was my assessment that probation is not an appropriate sentencing option for two reasons. First, the Accused is not ordinarily resident in Singapore. Supervision and oversight of his conduct and behaviour would pose difficulties for the probation officer. Second, I was aware of the restrictions on movements of persons between Singapore and Malaysia in the current Covid-19 pandemic situation. This would add another layer of difficulty to the task of supervision and oversight on the Accused.

30     Thirdly, in my assessment, it is inexpedient to inflict punishment after considering the nature of the offence, the co-operation of the Accused in the investigations, his clean record, his plea of guilt and his remorse.

## Conclusion

31     In the final analysis, I concluded that a 12 months’ conditional discharge would be a adequate sentence. I proceeded to give the Accused a warning that he commits no offence during such period before granting a 12 months’ conditional discharge.

32     It leaves me to give one final quotation, and this is from _Giok Soon Guan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 655</span> at \[22\]:

> 22    It is also important to bear in mind that the sentence imposed must, at the end of the day, be fair to the accused, bearing in mind all the relevant mitigating factors. The principle of proportionality “acts as a counterbalance to the principles of deterrence, retribution and prevention”, in that “the sentence must be commensurate with the gravity of the offence, … the sentence must fit the crime, and … the court should not lose sight of the ‘proportion which must be maintained between the offence and the penalty and the extenuating circumstances which might exist’” (see, respectively, _Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1028</span> at \[21\] and _PP v Saiful Rizam bin Assim_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 495</span> at \[29\]).
