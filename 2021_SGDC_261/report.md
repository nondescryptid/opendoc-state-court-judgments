> with a total value of S$26,590, did commit criminal breach of trust, to wit, by dishonestly converting the Jewellery to your own use by pawning the Jewellery, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       The accused was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. He has filed an appeal against sentence in person, and has been released on bail pending appeal.

**Statement of Facts**

3       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification:-

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

> 1.    The accused is Athinamilagi Karuppiah, NRIC No. Sxxxx601J, a 53-year-old male Indian National and Singapore Permanent Resident born on 3 June 1968.

> 2.    The victim is Parameswari Singaravelloo, a 50-year-old female.

> 3.    The witness is Periyandavan Murugam, a 51-year-old male. The witness is the victim’s friend.

> **FIRST INFORMATION REPORT**

> 4.    On 30 November 2019, at or about 12.49pm, the victim lodged a Police report stating that she handed over various pieces of jewellery to the accused so that he could hand over the same to her friend in India and that the accused had since become uncontactable.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE (DAC-918018-2020)**

> 5.    The victim wished to hand over the following pieces of jewellery, with a total value of S$26,590 and which belonged to her, to “Giri”, her friend:

>> a)    one gold bracelet (weighing 39.9g);

>> b)    one gold bracelet (weighing 32.1g);

>> c)    one gold necklace (weighing 80.4g);

>> d)    one gold necklace (weighing 67.7g);

>> e)    two gold chains (weighing 148.4g);

>> f)    one gold chain (weighing 5.3g);

>> g)    one gold chain (weighing 62.19g);

>> h)    two gold bangles (weighing 38.6g); and

>> i)    four gold earrings (weighing 17.88g) (collectively, the “Jewellery”).

> 6.    The victim wished to do so as she wanted Giri to redesign the Jewellery.

> 7.    As Giri was based in India, he asked the victim to hand over the Jewellery to the accused, who was a friend of Giri’s, so that the accused could then bring the Jewellery to India and hand over the same to Giri. Giri asked the accused to do this as the accused had informed him that he would be travelling to India from Singapore on 28 November 2019.

> 8.    The victim therefore travelled from Malaysia, where she lived, to Singapore on 27 November 2019 so that she could meet the accused and hand over the Jewellery to him.

> 9.    Later the same day, at or about 5.30pm, the accused, the victim and the witness met at a restaurant located along Syed Alwi Road, Singapore. After the victim confirmed with Giri that the accused was indeed who he said he was, she handed over and entrusted the accused with the Jewellery. The victim also asked the accused to ensure that he handed over the Jewellery to Giri in India. The accused told the victim that he would hand over the Jewellery to Giri’s business partner, Ganesan, in India and that Ganesan would then hand over the Jewellery to Giri. After Giri confirmed with the victim that this was the plan, the victim agreed to the accused handing over the Jewellery to Ganesan so that he could then hand over the same to Giri in India. The witness witnessed all of this, including the accused confirming that he would hand over the Jewellery entrusted to him to Ganesan in India.

> 10.    The accused did not subsequently travel to India and hand over the Jewellery to either Ganesan or Giri. Instead, the accused dishonestly converted the Jewellery to his own use by pawning the Jewellery at six different pawnshops across Singapore between 27 and 29 November 2019. The accused received S$26,590 from the various pawnshops in return. The accused then gambled away the said S$26,590 at the Marina Bay Sands Casino on 27, 28 and 29 November 2019.

> 11.    The accused then became uncontactable as he deliberately switched off his mobile phone so that no one, including Giri, could get through to him. The accused also did not return home as he was ashamed about his gambling and did not know how to face his family. The accused went to stay with his friend, Selvam, instead.

> 12.    After finding out from Giri that he had not received the Jewellery from the accused and finding herself unable to contact the accused, the victim decided to return to Singapore to lodge a Police report. The victim therefore returned to Singapore and lodged the Police report referred to at \[4\] above on 30 November 2019.

> 13.    The accused was subsequently placed under arrest on 10 December 2019.

> 14.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused committed an offence of criminal breach of trust as he was entrusted with property, namely, the Jewellery with a total value of S$26,590 belonging to the victim, and dishonestly converted the Jewellery to his own use by pawning the Jewellery at six pawnshops between 27 and 29 November 2019, and the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 15.    During the course of investigations, the Police seized the Jewellery from the six pawnshops the accused pawned the Jewellery at. The Police also seized the nine pawn tickets that were issued to the accused in respect of the Jewellery that he pawned.

> 16.    On 5 April 2021, the accused made full restitution of the sum of S$26,590 to the six pawnshops.

> 17.    The accused admits to the abovementioned offence and stands charged accordingly.

## Sentencing principles

4       The prescribed sentence for an offence of criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) punishable under section 406 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to 7 years or with fine or with both.

5       The pre-dominant sentencing consideration for CBT offences would be the need for deterrence and retribution.

6       The starting point in sentencing CBT offences would be to consider the amount misappropriated. Other non-exhaustive factors also had to be considered. These included (a) the quality and degree of trust reposed in the offender; (b) the period over which the act was perpetrated; (c) the use to which the money or property that was dishonestly taken was put; (d) the effect upon the victim; and (e) the impact of the offences on the public and public confidence: _Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Heng and others_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 474</span>.[^1]

## Consideration of sentence

7       The amount involved ($26,590) was substantial. The trust reposed in the accused was high. The victim travelled from Malaysia to hand her jewellery to him. She trusted him unreservedly to deliver her jewellery to India. Instead, the accused pawned her jewellery at six different pawnshops within a period of three days, starting from the day he received the jewellery. He gambled away the funds he received. He then became uncontactable on purpose by switching off his mobile phone. These circumstances indicated that a custodial sentence should be imposed.

8       In sentencing the accused, I took into account the factors raised in his plea-in-mitigation. In his favour, he had a clean record. He made full restitution about 15 months after he committed the offence. Although restitution was made, he continued to claim trial and only entered a guilty plea during the trial dates. While there was a delay in restitution and his plea of guilt, I was nonetheless prepared to consider these as a show of his remorse. The accused had various health issues including type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic ischemic heart disease. His ill-health was a factor which was intrinsic to him. As it was not exceptional, no weight could be placed on his ill-health as a mitigating factor.

9       The defence pleaded for a fine to be imposed, which was unrealistic. The prosecution submitted for a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment. In support of this, they relied on two sentencing precedents, where untraced offenders had made full restitution and pleaded guilty:-

> (a)     In _Public Prosecutor v Lim Yew Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 104</span>, the offender who was a dormitory manager committed CBT of $12,332 during a period of about one and a half months. One further charge of CBT of $4,150 was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. The prosecution submitted that although _Lim Yew Heng_ had acted with greater pre-meditation and the offences were committed over a longer period of time, a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was warranted in the present case as the amount involved was higher.

> (b)     In _Public Prosecutor v Yaw Kee Shen_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 72</span>, the offender who was a condominium manager, committed CBT of $21,739 over a period of about 10 months. One further charge of dishonestly converting a laptop worth $2,200 was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The offender was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment. The prosecution submitted that _Yaw Kee Shen_ was more culpable as he had committed his offences over a longer period of time. It submitted that in the present case, a slightly lower sentence should be imposed as the accused was less culpable.

10     These cases showed that even when the sums involved were smaller than in the present case, sentences of three to four months’ imprisonment were imposed. In my view, the prosecution’s sentencing position was reasonable and not excessive.

11     All considered, I sentenced the accused to three months’ imprisonment, which was just and proportional to his offence.
