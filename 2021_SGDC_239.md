25 October 2021

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was a 66-year old male Chinese. He pleaded guilty to two counts of snatch theft under s 356 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (“Penal Code”). A Newton hearing was then held to determine two issues which were disputed and would have an impact on the sentence. They were – (i) the Accused’s psychiatric condition and whether it was a contributory factor for the commission of the offence, and (ii) his motivation for committing the offences.

## The charges

2       The two charges against the Accused were as follows –

>      **DAC-927487-2019**

>     “are charged that you, on 14th October 2019, at about 12 pm, at the void deck of Block 7A Commonwealth Avenue, Singapore, did use criminal force on one Ngahamah Sinnappan, female, 68 years old, to commit theft of one gold chain, valued at about S$2,200, which was in the possession of and being worn by the said Ngahamah Sinnappan, _to wit_, by snatching the said gold chain which she was wearing around her neck from her, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 356 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

>      **DAC-929451-2019**

>     “are charged that you, on the 26th September 2019, sometime in the morning, along Buangkok Green, near Blk 988B Buangkok Green, Singapore, did use criminal force on one Toh Ie Choo, female, 67 years old, to commit theft of one gold necklace, valued at about S$1,700.00, which was in the possession of and being worn by the said Toh Ie Choo, _to wit_, by snatching the said gold necklace she was wearing around her neck from her, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 356 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

3       DPP Marcus Foo and DPP Benedict Teong were the prosecutors in this case. The Accused was represented by Mr Bachoo Mohan Singh and Mr Hong Kah Chon.

## The PG mention

4       The Accused admitted to the following facts, namely –

> DAC-927487-2019

> (a)     On 26 Sep 21, when the Accused was at the vicinity of Blk 988B Buangkok Green, he noticed Toh walking by with her 71-year old husband. At the time, the Accused had been thinking about how to earn some money as his cousin, whom he was lodging with, had threatened to evict him unless he paid $1,000.

> (b)     The Accused noticed that Toh was wearing a gold necklace. He then formed the intention to steal the gold necklace from Toh.

> (c)     The Accused followed Toh, before approaching her from behind without her and her husband noticing. He then pulled at the gold necklace and snatched it off from around Toh’s neck.

> (d)     Toh shouted out “robbery” in Hokkien. The Accused fled in the direction of Blk 988B Buangkok Green, and through the housing estate thereafter. Toh’s husband gave chase but he ended up falling down.

> (e)     The Accused fled to his home at Blk 984C Buangkok Link. He reached his home at about 9.22 am. He changed his clothes. At about 9.39 am, he left home and took a public bus to a pawnshop at Blk 682 Hougang Ave 4.

> (f)     At the pawnshop, he pawned the gold necklace for $1,700. He disposed of the pawn ticket at a dustbin near his home.

> (g)     The following events were captured by various CCTV cameras –

>> (i)       The Accused fleeing through Blk 988B Buangkok Green, wearing a white t-shirt and black shorts.

>> (ii)       The Accused thereafter proceeding into the lift of Blk 984C Buangkok Link at level 1 in a white t-shirt and black shorts. He subsequently emerged from the lift in an orange polo t-shirt and black shorts.

>> (iii)       The Accused entering the pawnshop at Blk 682 Hougang Ave 4.

> DAC-929451-2019

> (a)     On 14 Oct 21, at about 12 pm, Ngahamah was sitting at the void deck of Blk 7A talking to her friend, Magdelen Michael Naidu, a 71-year old female.

> (b)     The Accused was also at the same void deck. He noticed that Ngahamah was wearing a gold chain around her neck.

> (c)     The Accused recalled that he was being hounded by his friends over some money which he had owed them from betting on soccer matches and horse-racing. He then formed the intention to steal the gold chain.

> (d)     The Accused approached Ngahamah from behind. Magdelen signalled Ngahamah that the Accused was approaching her. As Ngahamah turned around, he grabbed the gold chain and pulled it off from around her neck.

> (e)     The Accused fled towards a nearby cemetery. Ngahamah tried to give chase but was unsuccessful. The Accused went to the Tanglin Halt area. There, he took a public bus to the vicinity of Ghim Moh. At Ghim Moh, he bought a shirt and a pair of slippers. He washed up and changed into them at a public toilet.

> (f)     He then took a taxi back to his home at Blk 577 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10. He reached his home at about 2.40 pm.

> (g)     He left his home at about 3.20 pm and went to a nearby pawnshop at Blk 555 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10. At the pawnshop, he pawned the gold chain for $2,200.

## The Newton hearing

### The issues

5       A Newton hearing was conducted to determine the following two issues –

> (a)      The nature of the Accused’s psychiatric condition and whether it contributed to the offences. The two medical reports admitted for this purpose were by Dr Christopher Cheok (“Dr Cheok”) for the prosecution, and Dr Tommy Tan (“Dr Tan”) for the defence. Briefly, Dr Tan opined that the Accused has persistent depressive disorder (“PDD”), and that he had suffered a major depressive episode (“MDE”) at the time the offences were committed. It was his opinion that the Accused’s PDD was a contributory factor in the commission of the offences. In contrast, Dr Cheok’s opinion was that the Accused did not suffer from PDD. But he agreed that the Accused had suffered from MDE at the material time and that it was of moderate severity. However, he was of the opinion that there was no contributory link between the Accused’s MDE and the offences.

> (b)      The motivation for the commission of the two offences. The Accused claimed that he had committed the offences solely in order to get his estranged wife’s attention. He did not commit them for financial gain. The prosecution’s case was that the motivation was for financial gain, and that his assertion that it was to get his wife’s attention was an afterthought.

6       It was pertinent to note that, at the conclusion of the Newton hearing, the defence abandoned Dr Tan’s diagnosis of PDD. Instead, they made their case on the basis that the Accused was suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”), and that he had MDE at the time of the offences. Surprisingly, they conceded that the MDE had no contributory link to the offences. Instead, they based their case on the argument that the MDE had factually contributed to the offences, in that, the MDE had affected the Accused’s clarity of thought and ability to think through the consequences of his actions.

### Analysis of the evidence

#### The Accused’s psychiatric condition

7       I now set out the salient points raised by Dr Tan and Dr Cheok in their respective psychiatric reports and their oral testimonies. In his psychiatric report (D3)[^1], Dr Tan opined that at the time of the offences, the Accused had suffered from “\[PDD\] with intermittent \[MDE\], current episode moderate”. He also opined that “it was very likely that \[the Accused\] has \[PDD\] since adolescence”. Dr Tan added that the Accused’s PDD was characterised by low self-esteem and low mood.

8       Dr Cheok disputed the above diagnosis. Instead he opined that the Accused’s pessimistic outlook on life was better explained by his history of physical abuse and recurrent stresses due to his social disadvantages and lifestyle[^2]. In so far as MDE was concerned, Dr Cheok agreed with Dr Tan that the Accused has MDE around the time of the alleged offences[^3]. However, it was his opinion that the MDE was not of such severity so as to impair both the Accused’s judgment of the nature of his acts and his ability to resist his actions[^4].

9       There was no dispute as to the credentials of both Dr Tan and Dr Cheok as experts in the field of forensic psychiatry.

10     In analysing and deciding on the two conflicting expert evidence, I took guidance from the decision of the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in _PP v Chia Kee Chen_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 249</span> (“_Chia Kee Chen_”). In _Chia Kee Chen_, the CA had laid down the following principles relating to expert evidence in the context of criminal proceedings -

> (a)     An expert must be neutral and independent. His overarching duty was to assist the court. But it was permissible for the expert to propound and press home the opinion that he sought to persuade the court to accept.

> (b)     An expert should provide the reasoning behind his conclusions or opinions. In other words, he should present the underlying evidence and the analytical process by which he reached his conclusions and opinions.

> (c)     The court would not hesitate, in appropriate cases, to disregard or even draw an adverse inference against expert evidence that exceeded the judicially determined boundaries of coherence, rationality and impartiality.

11     Applying the above principles, I found that Dr Cheok’s assessment of the Accused was objective, the scope of his investigations comprehensive, and his opinions and conclusions rational and coherent. I found these traits to be lacking or were inadequately featured in Dr Tan’s report and evidence. The reasons for my findings were set out below.

12     Firstly, I have grave doubts about the reliability and objectivity of Dr Tan’s conclusions because they were predominantly based on the Accused’s self-reporting accounts. As stated clearly at \[2\] of D3, Dr Tan had only relied on his examination and interview with the Accused at the Changi Prison Complex on 11 March 2020, and an interview with his wife on 9 March 2020. I noted that Dr Tan had conceded that he was aware that the Accused could have provided him with an account that was favourable to him in order to get a lighter sentence. Notwithstanding his awareness of this danger, Dr Tan had decided that it was not necessary to request for other relevant documents or evidence concerning the offences in question so that he could make his assessment and arrive at his conclusions in an objective manner. It was not disputed that these documents were readily accessible to him at the time. They included the charges and the statement of facts to which the Accused had already pleaded guilty to without qualification in court.

13     Dr Tan himself had conceded during cross-examination[^5] that his assessment appeared to be “lopsided” because of the undue emphasis given to the Accused’s self-reporting and probably self-serving accounts. He agreed that the conclusions in his report were solely based on the Accused’s account. He also agreed with the prosecution’s suggestion that his assessment was heavily tilted in favour of the Accused’s self-reports and self-interested accounts. Lastly, he also agreed that it would be difficult to give weight to his report insofar as it represented what had actually taken place at the material time.

14     Given these concessions, I found Dr Tan’s assertion that he had tried to be fair and balanced in his assessment and that if there was new evidence he would be happy to change his opinion to be inexplicable. His assurances about being fair and balanced in his assessment was wholly inconsistent with his action. As highlighted earlier, there were other relevant evidence available at the time of his assessment of the Accused which would have given a more objective and balanced account of the offences. He had not asked for these other relevant evidences. The omission was also inconsistent with his claim during re-examination that he would look at the statement of facts and other sources of information to confirm his diagnosis[^6]. He did not do this in this case. Instead, he was contented to make his assessment and findings based wholly on the Accused’s accounts. This was despite the fact that he had sensed that the Accused was being economical with the facts during the interview[^7], and he was aware of the risk that the Accused would be motivated during the interview to procure a report that would get him a lighter sentence[^8]. These shortcomings cast grave doubts on the objectivity and impartiality of his assessment and conclusions contained in his report.

15     Another point that further underscored the lack of objectivity in Dr Tan’s report was the fact that he had omitted to include in his report his assessment that the Accused has a high risk of re-offending. Pertinently, during cross-examination, he had conceded that he had omitted to mention this assessment in his report because he was aware that it would have been detrimental to the Accused’s case[^9]. However, he pointed to two paragraphs in his report (D3 at \[45\] and \[46\]), in which he claimed had addressed the Accused’s high risk of recidivism. I respectfully disagreed as a plain reading of the two paragraphs showed that this was not so. In these two paragraphs, Dr Tan had made several observations. He had opined that imprisonment had not been beneficial to the Accused. He had claimed that the Accused’s past forensic history had shown that he could lead a normal crime-free life when he was married and had good marital support. He had recommended that the Accused should have counselling, residence at a half-way house and attend psychiatric follow-ups after his release. He had then concluded by stating that it was more valuable to prevent the Accused from future offending behaviour than to subject him to a long custodial sentence. There was nothing in these two paragraphs that informed the reader about the Accused’s high risk of offending. In fact, the paragraphs appeared slanted in the Accused’s favour. All considered, I found that the omission the Accused’s risk of re-offending, and the attempt to plaster over the omission using the two paragraphs underscored Dr Tan’s partisanship towards the Accused. As an expert, he was duty bound to disclose all relevant facts even if they were detrimental to the Accused’s case. He had not discharged that duty.

16     Dr Tan’s diagnosis that the Accused suffered from PDD was also flawed. This stemmed from his failure to adequately take into account two factors; (i) the Accused’s alcohol abuse, and (ii) his employment as a cook at the material time. According to the DSM-V[^10], alcohol or substance abuse rendered a diagnosis of PDD invalid. This was because the Accused’s depressive symptoms could have been attributable to the alcohol abuse. Dr Tan was aware that the Accused had consumed alcohol. But he had not investigated into it in greater detail, even though he was aware that this factor was crucial and relevant in any diagnosis of PDD. In cross-examination, Dr Tan had admitted that one reason why he had not done so was because the report had been prepared in some haste, and that this might have compromised the amount of information that he had received from the Accused, and therefore affected the comprehensiveness of his assessment[^11]. On the Accused’s employment as a cook, the fact that the Accused was gainfully employed suggested that there was no impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. This was significant because for a PDD diagnosis to stand, there must have been an impairment in one of these areas. Dr Tan was unable to give any cogent reason why he had made a diagnosis of PDD when the Accused had abused alcohol and was gainfully employed at the material time.

17     Dr Tan had also opined in his report that the Accused’s psychiatric condition was a “contributory factor” in the commission of the offences. This opinion was premised on his finding that the Accused was not thinking clearly[^12]. By this, he had meant that the Accused had not considered the consequences ie, the heavy penalty that he would be exposed to[^13]. At this juncture, it would be useful to set out the Accused’s testimony in court during the Newton hearing in relation to the offences that he had committed. They were[^14] -

> (a)     He was aware and was afraid of the heavy penalty if he was caught when he committed the offences;

> (b)     He was not confused at the time he committed the offences;

> (c)     He had followed the victim in the first charge for about five minutes before he snatched her necklace;

> (d)     He had selected the victim in the second charge because she was a female and elderly. He had approached her from behind to prevent her from reacting. These factors had increased his chances of escaping successfully with the stolen item;

> (e)     He had changed his attire after committing both offences in order to avoid being identified in the CCTV footages.

The above evidence was inconsistent with Dr Tan’s findings about the Accused’s clarity of thought. To his credit, when he was shown the Accused’s evidence set out above, he conceded that, in that case, his opinion could not stand[^15]. I found that the Accused’s thought processes in planning the offences and avoiding detection showed a clear presence of mind on his part. There was a significant degree of premeditation and deliberation in his actions.

18     Lastly, it was also significant to note that, during cross-examination, Dr Tan had agreed with Dr Cheok’s assessment on the following aspects – (i) that the Accused had MDD but it was “not of a severity as to impair his judgment of the nature of his acts”; (ii) that the Accused knew that his actions were wrong, and the MDD “did not impair his ability to resist his actions”[^16]; and (iii) that even if the Accused had PDD, it would not have impaired his judgment and it would not have impaired his ability to appreciate the nature of his actions.

19     On the other hand, I found that Dr Cheok was objective in his assessment of the Accused, in that he had relied on a variety of sources of information, including the charge sheets, the summary of facts and the observation notes of the Accused recorded by the nursing staff at IMH[^17]. He had not just relied on the Accused’s account of the two offences. For these reasons, I found that his report was not only objective, it was also more comprehensive and detailed. I noted that the defence had also not suggested to Dr Cheok during cross-examination that he had been biased against the Accused in his assessment.

20     I found that Dr Cheok’s criticism and rejection of Dr Tan’s findings of PDD was based on very cogent and sound reasons. These have been addressed in detail earlier at \[16\]. Essentially, Dr Tan’s findings did not comport with the guidelines set out in the DSM-V. I also noted that the defence had not put or suggested to Dr Cheok that his criticism of Dr Tan’s findings was invalid or flawed.

21     Dr Cheok’s reasonings for his finding that there was no contributory link between the Accused’s MDE and the offences were sound and logical. I agreed with the prosecution that his opinion was based on a thorough and comprehensive appreciation of the facts and circumstances of the case. He had explained[^18] that the two offences were “very goal directed” and comprised “very complex actions” including choosing potential targets that gave him the highest probability of success. He had aimed at the gold chain and gold necklace worn by the victims, snatched them and then made his escape. He had then pawned both items almost immediately. These actions were not random, not accidental, and certainly not impulsive. In fact, Dr Cheok was of the view that there was a certain amount of “goal-directed planning”. They also showed that the Accused knew that what he had done were wrong. For these reasons, he opined that the MDE had not impaired the Accused’s ability to control himself.

22     I noted that, in arriving at this opinion, Dr Cheok had applied the test set out in the judgment of See Kee Oon J in _PP v Hannah Ho Mei Xia_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 211</span> at \[40\]. These were –

> (a)     Where the mental disorder affected the offender’s capacity to exercise self-control and restraint;

> (b)     Where the mental condition diminished the offender’s ability to appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of his conduct. This might relate to the offender’s knowledge of the legal or moral wrongfulness of his actions.

23     In conclusion, I accepted Dr Cheok’s opinion. Therefore, I found that there was no contributory link between the Accused’s MDE and the offences that he had committed.

#### The Accused’s motivation for committing the offences

24     The Accused claimed that he had committed the offences solely to get his estranged wife’s attention; that he did not do them for financial gain. However, the evidence before me all pointed inexorably to financial gain as being the overriding consideration for these offences.

25     The Accused had targeted gold jewellery which carried significant monetary value. The gold chain and necklace that he had snatched had been pawned for $1,700 and $2,200. He had also pawned them almost immediately after. I found this conduct to be wholly incongruous with his assertion that he had only wanted to get his wife’s attention. Also, the Accused had taken steps to avoid detection. The offences were committed in such a way as to afford him the best chances of success and escape. He had changed attires after each offence. In one case, he had purchased new clothes and then changed into them in a public toilet. He had pawned the stolen items almost immediately and thrown away the pawn tickets. In my view, all these actions reinforced the inference that he had committed these offences for money.

26     In his police statements, the Accused had made it very clear that his motive for the crimes was for money. In his statement dated 30 September 2019[^19], he had categorically stated that he committed the first offence because his cousin had wanted $1,000 from him and he had felt stressed out over how to obtain this amount. He had then seen the first victim wearing a gold chain and decided to steal it. In his statement dated 17 October 2019[^20], he had stated that he had been thinking about being hounded by his friends over some debts owed to them from his soccer and horse race betting activities. He had then decided to steal from the second victim whom he had seen wearing a gold chain. These two statements had been admitted and I gave full weight to them.

27     These statements were also consistent with his testimony. During cross-examination he had made several admissions –

> (a)     He had conceived the idea of stealing the jewellery in order to get quick cash[^21];

> (b)     He had wanted to commit the offence in the first charge in order to earn quick cash to pay the rent that he owed to his cousin[^22];

> (c)     He had committed the offence in the second charge because he had owed his friends a few thousand dollars arising from his soccer and horse racing bets[^23]. He said he could pawn the stolen item to get the money to repay the debts[^24].

28     Significantly, his claim that he had only wanted to get his wife’s attention was never raised in any of his police statements. The evidence before me suggested that this claim had only arisen during his interviews with Dr Tan and Dr Cheok when they were evaluating him. Even so, he had not excluded financial gain as a motivation for committing the offences during these interviews. More pertinently, he had admitted during cross-examination that he had fabricated this claim in the hope of procuring a more favourable evaluation[^25]. It was clear therefore that the claim was an afterthought.

## The sentence

### The prescribed punishment

30     The prescribed punishment for a s 356 PC offence was mandatory imprisonment for a term of not less than one year and not more than 7 years and shall also be liable to caning.

### Submissions on sentence

31     The prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence was nine years’ prevention detention (“PD”). This was because the Accused was a recalcitrant repeat offender who has strong criminal proclivities and has no regard for the law. He has remained undeterred and unrehabilitated despite having been sentenced to numerous periods of imprisonment previously, including two sentences of PD. The most recent PD sentence was for nine years. As such, he posed a menace to the public, and the dominant sentencing consideration was incapacitation for the protection of society.

32     The prosecution also submitted that in imposing PD, proportionality would be considered to a limited degree: _Sim Yeow Kee v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span> at \[97\]. In this case, PD could not be said to be disproportionate. On account of the Accused’s previous convictions and sentences, he would have faced a significant total sentence if normal imprisonment was imposed. This was because the principle of escalation would apply with full force, and he would have faced a total imprisonment term in excess of nine years.

33     Therefore, as the Accused was assessed to be suitable for PD, and given that the risk of offending was assessed to be in the moderate range, the prosecution urged me to impose nine years’ PD.

### The mitigation plea

34     The defence highlighted the Accused’s unfortunate background. He was adopted by his aunt after his parents passed away when he was two years old. Initially he was treated well. When he turned 11 years old, things turned bad and he subjected to physical abuse from his adoptive father. At secondary school he became a gang member for companionship. This was his start to a life of crime, including drugs. The defence emphasised that the offences that the Accused had committed were essentially the result of his lack of a role model, and because he did not have anyone who could have counselled and guided him to the right path. He had always associated himself with negative peer influences, and these had led to the numerous offences committed by him. He had also attempted suicide in 2010.

35     The defence highlighted that during his second PD sentence, he had taken solace from attending chapel sessions conducted by the Prison Ministry of the Faith Community Baptist Church (“FCBC”). The Accused became a Christian and resolved to change his life. Upon his release, he voluntarily signed up for recovery programmes run by FCBC as part of his goal to change his ways and to become a prison counsellor. Unfortunately, a mixture of significant stressors, including his wife’s affair, his cousin cheating him and kicking him out of the house, monetary pressures and his MDD, had caused him to fall back into a downward spiral. This led to the present set of offences.

36     The defence opposed the prosecution’s sentencing position for two reasons. Their main argument was that PD was not appropriate simply because the Accused was not beyond reform. PD was for offenders who were beyond redemption and too recalcitrant for reformation. Second, they argued that PD was disproportionate to the offences committed.

37     The factors the defence relied on for saying that the Accused was still amenable to reformation or rehabilitation included –

> (a)      His sense of remorse for the offences. The defence highlighted the Accused’s genuine remorse and deep regret for the hurt caused to his victims. His remorse was indicated by his confessions to the police and the full restitution that he had made.

> (b)      The nature of his familial, social and supportive elements. The Accused has the full support of the FCBC. FCBC believed in his ability to reform himself. In addition, the Accused’s wife had sworn to support his reformative journey and to ensure that he did not re-offend again. She had been a constant source of support during his remand for these offences. The Accused had also attended a gang renunciation ceremony where he renounced all ties with gangs. The Accused also possessed work skills which would enable him to keep off crime. He had previously run a cleaning business with his wife. He was also a good chef and had participated in a programme in Prison whereby he and other prisoners had prepared food for outside catering. There was also a possible job opportunity in a construction business run by his wife and her brother.

> (c)      The longest period that he had stayed away from crime. The Accused had stayed crime-free for about 10 years ie from 1992 to 2002. This indicated that the Accused was capable of leading a normal life without resorting to crime.

> (d)      Whether the previous sentences or orders with the aim of rehabilitation had helped him. The Accused had remained drug free after his admission into DRC in 2001. This was significant in the context of his 18-year drug addiction. It showcased his ability and will power to change for the better. It showed that he was amenable to reform.

> (e)      His sincere desire to change: The defence stressed that the Accused was sincere in his desire to turn his life around. He sought for one final chance to show that he was capable of change. In support, the defence cited the testimonials from John Tang, a prison counsellor, Pastor Daniel Gan, and Pastor Jason Tan.

> (f)      His age. However, the defence did not elaborate how, in this case, the Accused’s age showed that he was still amenable to reform.

38     The defence also referred to four cases where the courts had not meted out a sentence of PD despite the preponderance of factors that pointed to PD as being the appropriate sentence. The defence used these cases to support their submission that when there was **some evidence of remorse or an inclination towards reformation**, the courts have not imposed PD. The cases were –

> (a)      _PP v Tan Soon Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 282</span>;

> (b)      _PP v Nakarasan s/o K S Sivaraman_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 88</span>;

> (c)      _PP v Loi Wenda_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 252</span>; and

> (d)      _PP v Ng Kim Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 245</span>.

39     Finally, the defence admitted that there were two main factors which stood against the Accused namely, (i) the Accused’s antecedent history, and (ii) the fact that he had committed the present offences shortly after his release and whilst he was on bail. However, the defence pointed out that these factors were present in some form or other in the four cases cited above. As such, they submitted that these two factors were not significant.

40     For the above reasons, the defence submitted that a sentence of six years’ Corrective Training (“CT”) was appropriate, as CT would strike a balance between the Accused’s reformation and the prevention of crime. This was because there was no automatic remission, and more importantly, the Accused would be subjected to the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”) upon his release. MAS would facilitate the Accused’s transition and reintegration into society. Lastly, unlike PD, the proposed CT sentence would not offend the principle of proportionality.

### The defence’s application to call for a fresh PD report

41     I would now like to address the defence’s submissions that I should reject the PD report furnished to the Court and call for a fresh PD report for two reasons – (i) the PD report lacked comprehensiveness, and (ii) there was a lack of transparency in the criteria for the re-offending risk assessment. On the issue of comprehensiveness, the defence alleged that the interview with the Accused was only 30 minutes long. The Accused had also been unable to recall details of his criminal history and the history of his relationship with his wife. The defence also alleged that the report did not consider the extensive social support that FCBC provided to the Accused, his crime-free hiatus for 10 years, his success in weaning off his drug addiction and the familial support that his wife could provide to him.

42     The defence’s submission was misconceived and without merit. It was baseless to argue that the report lacked comprehensiveness merely on the ground that the interview had only taken 30 minutes. I noted that the Accused’s memory difficulties was only in two areas ie, his criminal history and his relationship with his wife. Looking at the report, I found that Part IV of the report concerning the Accused’s “General Risk Factors” had contained all the material details. I therefore rejected the defence’s submission on this point.

### The sentence by the court

43     The Accused has a long history of antecedents dating from 1970. In that time, he had served significant periods of imprisonment, including two sentences of PD. I also noted that he had consistently spent less than one year in the community between sentences. The only exception was the period from 1991 to 2001, when he had stayed crime-free after his release from his first PD sentence.

44     I found it significant that the present offences were committed a few months after his release from his second PD sentence. Many of the offences that he had committed, including the present offences, involved some form of violence. In my mind, he was a recalcitrant offender, with strong criminal proclivities, and with no regard for the law. He posed a menace to the public. His track record showed that he remained unrehabilitated and undeterred. I agreed with the prosecution that the primary sentencing consideration in this case was that of incapacitation.

45     The defence’s submission that the Accused was still amenable to reform was against the weight of the evidence. I have noted and considered the testimonials furnished by the Accused’s prison counsellors and pastors. I noted their steadfast pronouncements that the Accused could still be reformed despite his latest relapse. But these are only their beliefs and were wholly unsupported and inconsistent with the objective evidence. When the Accused was released from his most recent stint in PD, he had FCBC and its staff to lean on in times of crisis and need. It was pertinent that he had not sought their help and guidance when he was purportedly weighed down with the stressors that he claimed were responsible for his relapse into criminal behaviour. Instead, he had skipped church services and, more significantly, did not attend other recovery programmes altogether.

46     On a related point, it was significant to note that the PD report had stated that the Accused had not assumed responsibility for his actions, Instead, he had shifted the blame for the present offences on his wife and his alcohol intoxication. More importantly, he had limited insight into the consequences of his actions, believing that there was no harm done as he had “returned everything to everyone”. All these factors pointed to the conclusion that the Accused was not amenable to reform.

47     The Accused’s hiatus from criminal activity from 1991 to 2001 was not a significant indicator that he was still amenable to reform. In my opinion, it was more significant that he had re-offended repeatedly from 2002 to 2010, when he was sentenced to his second PD sentence. Soon after his release from the second PD sentence, he had committed the present offences. In relation to the second snatch theft offence, he had committed it when he was on court bail for the first snatch theft offence. There was, in my mind, an element of brazenness and contempt for the law in his conduct.

48     Therefore, on the objective evidence, I found that the Accused was beyond reform. My conclusion was consistent with the findings in the PD report where it was assessed that he had a high risk of criminal re-offending, and a moderate risk of violence re-offending. Coupled with the absence of any significant protective factor[^26], I found that there was a high likelihood of recidivism.

49     I noted the four case precedents cited by the defence to show that that the courts had been slow to mete out sentences of PD despite the presence of egregious and aggravating circumstances. In reply, I referred to the Court of Appeal’s (“CA”) observations in _PP v Rosli Bin Yassin_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 831</span>. The CA stated (at \[21\] of the judgment) that an assessment of such matters was intensely fact-centric and the relevant case law was more useful from the perspective of general principles as opposed to the resolution of the particular factual situation. In my mind, the cases highlighted the need by the sentencing court to consider all the relevant factors holistically.

50     In my view, an objective and holistic assessment of the particular factual situation in the present case pointed to the inexorable conclusion that PD was the appropriate sentence.

51     The defence’s argument that a PD sentence was wholly disproportionate to the crimes committed was misconceived. In _Sim Yeo Kee v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span> (at \[97\])(“_Sim Yeow Kee_”), the court stated that the principle of proportionality would have a limited scope for displacing the imposition of PD where such a sentence would otherwise be warranted. This was because in the context of PD, general deterrence and the social value of keeping a hardened criminal out of circulation provided a legitimate basis and operative justification for the application of the PD regime. As such considerations of proportionality would not be applied rigorously.

52     Having in mind that consideration of proportionality was not wholly excluded, but only of limited scope, I did not find that PD was a disproportionate sentence in this case. Given his long criminal record, and the sentences meted out, including the two PD sentences, the Accused would have faced a significant global sentence if regular imprisonment was imposed. As pointed out by the prosecution, in 2006 he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for a property offence of theft of a motor vehicle or component parts thereof. In 2010, he was sentenced to nine years; PD for, _inter alia_, snatch theft offences. He committed similar offences just months after he was released from that PD sentence. If I had been minded to impose sentences of imprisonment, deterrence would have required that the principle of escalation be applied with full force. It was therefore likely that the global imprisonment term imposed would have been in excess of nine years.

53     On quantum, I agreed with the prosecution that nine years’ PD was appropriate. I was aware that on the face of it, there was merit in imposing an uplift from his last PD sentence of nine years. However, on the whole, I was of the view that nine years’ PD would achieve the primary objective of PD which was the protection of the public. In arriving at this decision, I had factored into my considerations the Accused’s plea of guilty, and that he had made full restitution to the victims.

## Conclusion

54     I therefore sentenced the Accused to nine years’ PD. The sentence was backdated to 18 October 2019.

55     The Accused has lodged an appeal against sentence. He is currently serving his sentence.
