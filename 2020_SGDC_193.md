5       According to the prosecution, there was overwhelming evidence pointing to the accused’s theft of motorcycles on all six counts:

> (a)     The accused had confessed to the theft and explained the modus operandi in three long statements (PS 1 – 3), five of his six cautioned statements (PS 4 – 6, 8, 9), as well as in a statement recorded by SI Jegajeed Singh in his Field book (PS 7).

> (b)     His co-accused David had pleaded guilty at a mention where he was represented by counsel and had admitted without qualification to a Summary of Facts which implicated the accused in relation to the 1st to 5th charges.

> (c)     Some of the motorcycles and their dismantled component parts had been recovered in the vicinity of or within the accused’s office.

> (d)     The accused’s attempt to interfere with and persuade PW4 Maidin to testify in his favour at trial was indicative of his guilt. This came to light when the witness, after initially testifying in the accused’s favour as requested, later recanted and implicated the accused with respect to the 6th charge.

6       The accused challenged the admissibility of nine of his statements (PS 1 – 9) at an ancillary hearing on the grounds that they were made under threat, inducement or promise. At the close of the ancillary hearing, I was satisfied that they were made voluntarily and admitted the following nine statements, for reasons which I shall provide later.

7       The statements are integral to the prosecution’s case, and the exact content of the statements and other evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of each individual charge is detailed in the following sections.

### (i)   The First Charge (the Woodlands Suzuki GSX charge)

8       The prosecution’s case in respect of this charge was that sometime between 21 November 2016 at or about 2 pm to 22 November 2016 at or about 6.30 am, both the accused and David drove to a carpark in Woodlands to steal the Suzuki GSX motorcycle, valued at $26,000, belonging to one Imbadullah Bin Mohamed Raffick.

9       In PS1 (at \[10\] and \[12\]), the accused admitted that on 21 November 2016, David came to the accused’s shop and they both agreed to go out to look for motorcycles to steal. David drove the accused in a van to the multi-storey car park at Blk 588A Woodlands Drive 16. When they arrived, they saw a black/silver Suzuki GSX motorcycle bearing registration number FBL 393D parked in the car park. They alighted from the vehicle, whereupon David set up a plank against the van and they both pushed the motorcycle into the van. Thereafter, they travelled in the van to No. 89 Short Street where the motorcycle was unloaded at the sixth floor office of the accused.

10     In PS2 (at \[Q1 – A3\]), the accused continued the account and said that David left after he was paid $500 by the accused. He recounted how he then proceeded to dismantle the parts of the motorcycle and wrapped them in plastic wrap. His intention was to protect the parts and thereafter get a buyer for the motorcycle. The next day, on 22 November 2016, the accused texted an Indonesian contact to look for a buyer. There was negotiation on the price but no agreement was reached. That very night, the accused was arrested by police officers who raided his fifth floor office, where he was working on his DVD and CD printing machine. When questioned in his Further Long Statement (PS3), the accused again confirmed the theft and recounted how he had led the police officers to recover the motorcycle at the location he had placed it before he could find a buyer[^1].

11     The account provided by the accused was confirmed by David in the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) admitted with his plea of guilt for aiding and abetting the accused on this same charge. David admitted in the SOPF (P12 at \[5\]) that he had agreed to help the accused steal motorcycles, for which he would receive a $500 cut for every motorcycle stolen. He explained that the _modus operandi_ was to drive a rented van to the target location, whereupon both of them would find a motorcycle preferably of an expensive make and use a wooden plank positioned at the back of the van to push the motorcycle on board. They would then take the stolen motorcycle to the accused’s office at Great Wall Centre, 89 Short Street, where the accused would pay David his share. The accused would then sell the motorcycle off to an overseas buyer, or dismantle the motorcycle for its valuable spare parts.

12     In relation to the particular Suzuki GSX motorcycle pertaining to the first charge, David gave details in \[13\] of the SOF (P12) that the accused had held the handles of the Suzuki GSX motorcycle and pushed it into the van, and that he had assisted by pushing the motorcycle from the rear. David then drove with the accused to 89 Short Street to unload the motorcycle, where he was paid $500 and left.

13     The cautioned statement in relation to this charge provided by the accused to SI Jegajeed Singh on 23 Nov 2016 at 1.35 pm was not admitted by the prosecution as the accused did not admit to his part in the offence in that statement. The accused stated in this cautioned statement that although he had rented the van, David had said that the bike belonged to a friend and that his friend had wanted to sell the bike. The cautioned statement was instead admitted by the defence as DS1.

### (ii)   The Second Charge (the Woodlands Harvey HUG charge)

14     The prosecution’s case in relation to the Woodlands Harvey HUG charge was that sometime between 19 November 2016 at about 7.00 pm to 21 November 2016 at or about 10.30 am, David drove the accused to a multi-storey car park at Blk 614A Woodlands Avenue 4. When they arrived, they saw a Harley Davidson XLH HUG motorcycle valued at about $8,500 belonging to one Jamale Bin Sumuri. They pushed the motorcycle into their van, drove to No. 89 Short Street, where it was unloaded and the accused was paid $500.

15     The accused admitted to the above facts at \[9\] of PS1, where he added that he began to look for a buyer of the motor cycle immediately after unloading it at his office. He provided further details at PS3[^2], where he explained that he had chosen this location as he had noticed the motorcycle on an earlier visit when he was on site to buy a motorcycle from another person. The accused revealed that he had formed the intention to return and steal it.

16     In his cautioned statement in response to this charge (PS8), the accused recounted how he had spotted this Harley Davidson motorcycle on a previous visit to buy another motorcycle, and had returned to take it. He also asked for leniency and expressed remorse, stating that “a few hours of mischief has led me to another downfall again.”

17     In the Statement of Facts (P12) admitted to by David in relation to aiding and abetting the accused for this charge, the same modus operandi was described, and David admitted that he was likewise paid $500 after the motorcycle was unloaded at the accused’s office at 89 Short Street.

### (iii)   The Third Charge (the Woodlands Yamaha VMAX charge)

18     The prosecution’s case in relation to the third charge was that sometime between 21 November 2016 at or about 4.00 am to about 3.00 pm on the same day, the accused and David went to the multi-storey carpark at Blk 687 Woodlands Drive 75, where they stole a black Yamaha VMAX motorcycle valued at about $7,500 which was parked and in the possession of Ibrahim Bin Allaudin.

19     The accused admitted to applying the same modus operandi to the theft of this motorcycle in PS1 at \[11\]. He also recounted in PS2 at \[3\] that after he was arrested, he led the police officers to his sixth floor office, where the Yamaha VMAX motorcycle was recovered (a fact which he repeated in PS3[^3]).

20     In his cautioned statement (PS 9), the accused admitted to the theft of the Yamaha VMAX motorcycle, but tried to pin a greater share of the blame on David, in a somewhat garbled explanation, the full text of which is reproduced as follows:

> I did told Lee Teck Chye that I do not want to do it again as I have a business to run. Lee Teck Chye offered me $ (sic) if I helped him to take the motorcycle, he will only accept $500 from me as payment. I told him I do not have any buyer presently. He convinced me to place the motorcycle at my office first.

21     No specific reference was made to this motorcycle under David’s SOF (P12), as the relevant charge was admitted and taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

### (iv)   The Fourth Charge (the Paya Ubi Harley charge)

22     The prosecution’s case for the fourth charge is that sometime between between 21 October 2016 at or about 12.00 pm to 24 October 2016 at or about 11.20 am, the accused had driven David to a car park located at Level 3 of Blk 53 Ubi Ave 1, Paya Ubi Industrial Estate in a van and stolen a parked Harley Davidson motorcycle valued at about $8,500, which was in the possession of one Matthew Lim Ching Ming.

23     The accused explained in PS1 at \[8\] that David had informed him of a motorcycle left at Paya Ubi unattended and asked him if he was interested. David drove him there in a van rented by the accused, and it was close to 11 pm when they arrived. With the use of a plank of wood that the accused had brought along, they loaded the Harley Davidson motorcycle into the van and stored it in a third floor unit of No. 89 Short Street, which the accused had also rented. Next, the accused contacted a buyer from Indonesia, but there were no takers as yet. The accused then paid David $500 for the job and left the premises.

24     Then accused further explained in PS3 at \[A1\] that on 2 December 2016, he had led police officers to the scene in question. Prior to the date of theft, the accused revealed that he had come once to “recee” the area and had seen the Harley Davidson parked in the car park. He then confirmed how David and he had taken the motorcycle and unloaded it at his third floor office at the Golden Wall Centre.

25     The accused likewise admitted to the charge in his cautioned statement (PS4). He also stated that he regretted his actions and pleaded for leniency as he had cooperated fully with the police.

26     David had, in his plea of guilt, admitted to a charge of aiding and abetting the accused in this offence and agreed that it be taken into consideration for the purposes of his sentence.

### (v)   The Fifth Charge (the Sin Ming Harley charge)

27     The prosecution’s case for the fifth charge was that sometime between 10 November 2016 at or about 11.00 am to 13 November 2016 at or about 8.00 pm, David drove the accused in a van to an open space carpark at No. 10 Sin Ming Drive, where they took a parked Harley Davidson motorcycle valued at about $8,000 in the possession of one Starki.

28     The accused recounted in PS2 (at \[4\]) that he had decided to admit to this case after he was interviewed in custody. At PS 2 \[5\]-\[6\]), he explained that during trips to the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”), David and himself had seen the black Harley Davidson motorcycle parked at No. 10 Sin Ming Drive, which was a car park located at the LTA. According to the accused, David had suggested that they go to steal it. The accused then drove a rental van to the car park with David, after which they loaded the bike onto the van. In PS3 (at \[A1\]), the accused further stated that they parked the van overnight at a multi-storey car park where David was staying, and the accused paid David $500 before taking a taxi back to the office. The next day, David drove the van to the accused’s office at the Golden Wall Centre, and the accused eventually sold the motorcycle to his Indonesian contacts for $6,000 who came to tow the motor cycle away. In PS7, the accused was further recorded as saying that the money was split between himself and David.

29     In his cautioned statement (P5) in relation to this charge, the accused admitted the charge and expressed remorse for what he had done.

30     David had also agreed for a charge of aiding and abetting the accused in the theft of this motorcycle to be taken into consideration for sentencing at his plea of guilt.

### (vi)   The Sixth Charge (the Woodsvale Harley charge)

31     The prosecution’s case for the sixth charge was that between 28 luly 2015 at or about 1.00 prn, to 11 January 2016 at or about 9.00 am, Maidin had driven the accused to the basement car park of No. 19 Woodlands Drive 72, Woodsvale Condominium (the "incident location"). The accused had lied to Maidin that he needed help to transport a friend’s motorcycle. The accused saw the black Harley Davidson motorcycle valued at about $8,000 and in the possession of Rashpal Singh S/O Piara Singh. He pushed it into the van, after which Maidin drove the van to No. 89 Short Street where it was unloaded. Maidin was paid $25 for his efforts. Subsequently, the accused sold the motorcycle to an unknown overseas buyer $3,000.

32     In PS2, at \[4\], the accused explained that he had admitted to this case while questioned in custody. At \[8\]-\[11\] of PS2, he explained how he came to know Maidin when he sold the latter a scooter and parts. The accused revealed that he had spotted the Harley Davidson motorcycle when he was selling another motorcycle to a resident of Woodsvale Condominium. The accused observed that the Harley Davidson motorcycle was dusty and there was oil leaking from it. He was unable to crank it up as the battery was flat. A few days later, he called Maidin and asked him to borrow his friend’s van to help pick up a motorcycle at the condominium. When they arrived, the accused found the motorcycle, alighted and loaded it onto the van by pushing it up on a plank. The accused then told Maidin to drive him to his office where the motorcycle was unloaded. It was eventually sold to the accused’s Indonesian contacts for $3,000 and towed away by the buyer.

33     In P3 (at \[A1\]), the accused emphasised that Maidin had no idea that the accused was stealing the motorcycle and thought he was only helping the accused tow a motorcycle belonging to a friend. The accused recounted that he had only given Maidin $20 plus dollars to cover the cost of petrol for the van.

34     In his cautioned statement (P6) in relation to the charge, the accused admitted to the charge and pleaded for leniency.

35     It is notable that in the extract from IO Jegajeed Singh’s Field Book (PS7) dated 26 Nov 2016, the record at “1105 hrs” notes that the accused was asked to come clean with all the cases he had done, and volunteered information relating to this motorcycle. He admitted he had been stealing motorcycles since early 2016, and apart from the facts earlier stated, the accused revealed that it was Maidin who had spoken to one of his own contacts who came to look at the bike, and that a deal was made for $6,000, of which the accused received $3,000 and Maidin received $3,000.

### (vii)   The Ancillary Hearing

36     The defence challenged the admissibility of all nine of the accused’s statements that the prosecution wished to adduce, and an ancillary hearing was held to determine whether the statements were made voluntarily.

37     For ease of reference, the statements are summarised in order of chronology as follows:

38     It was not in dispute that the accused was in police custody from 22 November until 16 December 2016, when he was released on bail.

39     The following witnesses were called to give evidence during the ancillary hearing:

40     The defence’s case was that the statements were inadmissible as they were procured by various inducements, threats and/or promises:

> (a)     On 22 November 2016, when the accused’s office was raided, it was alleged that lead detective SI Lim Hung Boon (“SI Lim”) together with other police officers forcefully opened the door to the accused’s office, rushed in and shouted at the accused very loudly, causing him to be in fear and shock.

> (b)     On 25 November 2016, when SI Lim interviewed the accused for over one hour at the interview room, SI Lim brandished an extendable rod (which was not of standard police issue) in front of the accused and threatened that if the accused did not cooperate, SI Lim would tender 32 charges against him and swing the rod to his face. SI Lim added that nobody would be able to help the accused as he was alone in the room with SI Lim. According to the accused, it was due to SI Lim’s threat that he told the latter, “You give me anything, I’ll sign”[^4].

> (c)     On 26 November 2016, the accused first confessed to the offences in an interview with SI Jegajeed Singh which was recorded in the latter’s Field Book. The defence submitted that as the first statement recorded from the accused on 23 November 2016 was a complete denial of any offence, the statement of this date must have been caused by the lingering effect of the alleged threats made by SI Lim on 25 November 2016.

> (d)     On 30 November 2016, during the statement taking by SI Jegajeed Singh, the accused recounted that SI Jegajeed had provided the accused with sandwiches and chicken rice in an attempt to induce him into giving a confession. SI Jegajeed also allegedly told the accused it would be okay to admit to the offences because the sentences nowadays were very light and the accused could later ask the Judge to give him a chance.

> (e)     On 5 December 2016, although no further threat or inducement was supposedly proffered, the accused claimed that the fear of being beaten up by SI Lim and being slapped with 32 charges still operated on his mind.

> (f)     The accused claimed that he had been beaten up before at a police station and this caused a phobia in him which led him to sign all the statements.

### a.   The arrest of the accused on 22 November 2016

41     SI Lim gave evidence at the ancillary hearing that he was a police officer of twenty years’ experience, bearing the rank of Station Inspector. He was assigned as Lead Detective to investigate into a string of motorcycle thefts, which led to an ambush operation involving 10-12 police officers at 89 Short Street against the accused. When the police officers tracked the accused entering his fifth floor office unit, they tried to apprehend him, but the accused locked himself in the unit and did not emerge even though the police officers identified themselves and shouted many times for him to exit. The decision was made to break into the office using a tool akin to a crowbar. The account of this episode was recorded in SI Lim’s investigation diary (admitted as P2), which records that the police officers forcefully opened the door of the accused’s third-floor office at the Golden Wall Centre at 89 Short Street on 22 November 2016 at about 10.05 pm.

42     After a short interview conducted by SI Lim, the accused was handcuffed and led to the open deck at level 6A as well as his office unit on the sixth floor, where the VMAX motorcycle and parts of other stolen motorcycles were recovered. Thereafter, the accused was escorted back to the police station.

43     The accused gave evidence in the ancillary hearing that before his arrest on 22 November 2016, he was walking down from the sixth floor where he kept motorcycles and parts to the fifth floor where he had an office running a printing business. He had seen three police officers at the fifth floor before he entered his office unit. He explained that he had started up the printing machine and worn headphones, and although he had heard knocking on the door, he did not open it as his boss had advised that they were printing “high profile discs”, and were not allowed to let anyone into the unit[^5]. He was therefore shocked when two police officers rushed into the unit. He said he was also in shock because SI Lim shouted at him, “I have already screened you. I know that all the big bike loss you do it.”[^6] He further alleged that SI Lim “started shouting at me very, very loud, very violently. So I’m still in shock that day”[^7].

### b.   Alleged threats made to the accused on and after 25 November 2016

44     SI Lim’s investigation diary (P2) records that the accused was brought out of the lock-up to attend an interview with him at 6.47 pm on 25 November 2016 that lasted nearly two hours. The entry records the following (with “B1” referring to the accused):

> I asked B1 if he had committed any other cases, besides the recovery of the four stolen motorcycles and B1 keep saying “you tell me what you have, then I tell you”. I then told B1 that I wanted him to tell me if he was involved in any other criminal activities and B1 insisted no. B1 informed “I have tell Police everything. I only help David to move the four motorcycles that I have helped Police to find back”. I then informed B1 that based on Police records, that (sic) may be other cases which he could be involved in. B1 then replied “you want me to sign what then I will sign. I will sign anything you give me”. I then told B1 that if he is not involved in any other cases, he does not have to admit and that Police will not ask him to sign any Charges if he informed he is not involved in. B1 acknowledged. I then queried him again how confidence (sic) is he that he is not involved in any other cases and B1 kept quiet and requested for some time to think. I then stopped the interview.

45     At 7.33 pm, SI Lim recorded in P2 that the accused acknowledged that he had stolen another Harley Davidson from Sin Ming Industrial Estate with David. At 8.15 pm, it was recorded in P2 that the accused had requested for a piece of paper to write down the other cases of theft that he was involved in. The accused then wrote a handwritten note (admitted as P3) which was signed by him, containing information about a Harley Davidson from a condominium in Woodlands which involved Maidin, and also an “Aprilia” from “3006 Ubi” which involved one “Taufik” (it was clarified that this latter vehicle was not the subject of any charge). The accused explained to SI Lim that he had known Maidin in prison, and explained how Maidin had driven a van to the condo with him and that they pushed the Harley Davidson motorcycle up to the van and left together[^8]. Following this, the accused was interviewed until 8.36 pm when he was brought back to the Charge Room as the doctor was in the station (the accused had earlier complained that he had rashes on his hand and had asked to see the doctor). It was noted by SI Lim at that point that no other complaints were received from the accused.

46     The case of the defence with regard to the 25 November 2016 interview was that SI Lim was “shouting at the top of his voice”[^9] at the accused, and said that if the accused did not admit to the present allegations of vehicle theft, 32 other charges of vehicle theft which SI Lim had been investigating would all be tendered against him. When questioned about this allegation, SI Lim maintained that he did not shout at the accused as there was no necessity and the accused was of an elderly age[^10].

47     It was further alleged that on this occasion, SI Lim brandished an extendable rod in front of the accused’s eyes. The accused was worried that he would be hit in the face as SI Lim was swinging the rod in front of his eyes[^11]. He explained that that was why he had written the note in P3, and that the names and motorcycles in the note were actually provided by SI Lim who had told him to write the information down. This included a reference to a motorcycle named “Aprilia”, which as mentioned, was not a subject of the present charges[^12]. The accused claimed that his will had been broken by SI Lim’s threats, and that was why he had said to SI Lim that he would sign anything given to him. The accused claimed that SI Lim had never cautioned that the accused did not have to admit to offences with which he was not involved.

48     The accused further added that there was a second occasion after this date when SI Lim came in with a Malay IO, and that SI Lim had said ‘Don’t forget what we can do to you”, after which he left[^13]. The accused interpreted this as a threat that SI Lim would tender all 32 charges against him if he did not confess to the existing charges. This second incident was denied by SI Lim, and no account of it exists in P2. Finally, the accused recalled a third occasion where SI Lim allegedly came in with SI Jegajeed Singh and stared at him in a threatening manner without saying anything before leaving[^14]. The accused claimed that these further incidents reinforced the threats made by SI Lim, the effect of which lingered on and tainted his later statements.

49     When questioned on these allegations, SI Lim explained that while he was issued with an extendable baton (what is commonly called a “nightstick”), such equipment could not be brought into the secured lock-up where the interview was conducted[^15]. SI Lim flatly denied that any threat of violence or of tendering additional charges had been made on any occasion against the accused.

50     Finally, the defence sought to undermine the weight to be attributed to SI Lim’s Investigation Diary (P2) with allegations that SI Lim had doctored the pagination of the document. It was pointed out that while the pagination on the first ten pages of the document revealed a total of 13 pages, the pagination on pages 11 to 14 reflected the correct total of 14 pages. SI Lim’s explanation was that page numbers were not automatically paginated but manually inserted by himself, and that this was a typographical error[^16]. As for the accused’s fears that he would be beaten up if he did not confess, SI Lim highlighted that as the accused was of elderly age, and that if anything were to happen to him in custody, it would be a bigger problem for the police to answer as compared to not being able to solve the case[^17].

### c.   29, 30 November and 5 December 2016

51     With regard to the Long Statement in two parts (PS 1 and PS2) made on 30 November 2016, the accused’s account was that the information was all provided by SI Jegajeed, and that his role was merely to sign the statements[^18]. He explained that he had done so because he was still in fear of SI Lim. In respect of all the other statements (a Further Long Statement and three cautioned statements) made on 5 December 2016, the accused re-iterated his position that he had signed these statements out of lingering fear of the threats made by SI Lim.

52     In respect of his cautioned statements, the accused added that the handwritten statements were written by the recorders themselves. In his evidence-in-chief, he said:

> After I promised the – IO Lim that I’m willing to sign all the papers – so I leave it to them to write whatever they want. So they do their own writing, this is not my handwriting, Your Honour. I just signed because out of fear.[^19]

53     When it was observed by the court that the handwriting in PS 8 and 9 recorded by SIO Norazlan Abdul Aziz looked remarkably similar to the accused’s handwritten document in P3, the accused maintained his view that P3 was his handwriting (albeit with the contents written at the direction of SI Lim), whereas P8 and 9 were not.

54     In addition, the accused also claimed that he was induced by the provision of chicken rice and sandwiches by SI Jegajeed Singh on 30 November 2016 to give his statement. This was flatly denied by the SI Jegajeed Singh, who explained that food was not allowed in the lock-up area, and that he had only provided the accused with a hot tea upon request[^20].

55     It bears noting as a footnote that there was a bizarre allegation made by the accused that IO Jegajeed Singh had tampered with the accused’s mobile phone (which remained in police custody) as the accused had found unknown photographs in his Dropbox account that were taken of some unrelated Caucasian persons (in D1). IO Jegajeed Singh explained that the accused’s phone was password-protected and that he had only accessed it with the permission of the accused in his presence. It was otherwise switched off and remained in police custody[^21]. This argument was understandably not canvassed any further in the defence’s submissions at the end of the ancillary hearing.

### d.   My decision in relation to the ancillary hearing

56     At the close of the ancillary hearing, I determined that the challenged statements were made voluntarily and admitted them accordingly. I now provide my reasons.

57     Section 258(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) (“CPC”) provides that an accused’s statement is inadmissible if “the making of the statement appears to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him”.

58     The burden lies on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a statement had been made voluntarily (see _Koh Aik Siew v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 1 SLR(R) 885</span> and _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span>). The test to determine voluntariness is also a partly objective and partly subjective one. The objective limb is satisfied if the court is satisfied that there exists a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb is met when it operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge (see _Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1983\] 2 MLJ 232</span>, _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_, _Sharom bin Ahmad v PP_ \[2000\]2 SLR(R) 541 and _Lim Thian Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 319</span>).

#### Fear and shock during arrest

59     The account of the arrest by the police and the accused did not differ materially. It was evident that some amount of sound and fury must be expected when the police stormed into the accused’s office. I gave the accused the benefit of the doubt that he was unaware that the police were demanding entry due to the sound of the printing machine and the fact that he was wearing headphones. However, I did not think the element of surprise involved in a forced entry to be sufficient to have overborne the will of the accused, especially since no statement was recorded from the accused during the arrest. It is also noteworthy that any kind of shock experienced by the accused would have no reference at all to the accused’s charges. To my mind, any shred of fear operating in the mind of the accused was entirely self-induced, and did not in any case have any appreciable effect on his state of mind some four days later when he made his first statement as recorded in IO Jegajeed Singh’s Field Book on 26 November 2016.

#### Threat of violent use of an extendable rod and tendering of additional charges

60     The crux of the accused’s challenge in the ancillary hearing rested on the behaviour of SI Lim. In the course of the ancillary hearing, I observed SI Lim to be an experienced and firm police officer of considerable seniority. I did not find any credible reason why he and his officers would have conspired to threaten the accused in order to frame him. Quite to the contrary, I found the allegations made by the accused to be far-fetched and incredulous when explored in detail.

61     First, there was a considerable passage of time between when the alleged threats were made on 25 November 2016 and when the formal statements were taken from 29 November 2016. It seems highly unlikely, if the will of the accused had indeed been suborned by way of threats, that the investigators would not have struck while the iron was hot and recorded his formal statements immediately. Even if the accused’s account were true, the passage of several days would also have served to greatly diminish any threats made. While it is true that a threat may linger and still serve to render a statement involuntary, (see _Tan See Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1966\] 1 MLJ 219</span> and _PP v Naikan_ <span class="citation">\[1961\] MLJ 147</span>), there was insufficient manifestation of the threat in the two further encounters that the accused claimed to have had with SI Lim. It has clearly been held that looking fierce and threatening alone would not be sufficient to render a statement involuntary (per _Gulam bin Notam Mohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 498</span>). In fact, there was no allegation by the accused that the recorders of his statement were anything but cordial with him. Taken in totality, there was simply no objective basis to believe that the accused’s will could have been overborne in the days following the alleged threat.

62     The second problem with the accused’s account is the immense amount of collusion that would have been necessary to frame the accused in the manner that was alleged. It pre-supposes that SI Lim and both statement recorders colluded to compel the accused to accept and sign off on fabricated statements. It presumes that the officers in charge of the lock-up facility looked the other way while SI Lim carried an extendable rod into the interview room, given that such weapons were not allowed in the facility. It would also have meant that the team of police officers had gone through an extraordinary charade of bringing the accused to three out of the six locations involved in the charges in order to claim that the accused could identify the locations of the theft[^22]. I found it highly unlikely that an enterprise to collude on such a scale and level of complexity would have been undertaken by the police simply to pin the blame for the theft of six motorcycles on the accused.

63     The third question that comes to mind if the accused is to be believed is why the police would have recorded several statements spanning several days, with each taking a considerable amount of time. There were three long statements recorded from the accused in total. Two were taken on 30 November with a 1 ½ hour break in between, and a further one taken on 5 December 2016. If the statements were a complete fabrication, it would have been easier to simply complete them in one sitting. When queried by the court why the first two long statements took a substantial amount of time and were recorded separately, the accused’s only reply was that he did not really know the timing, and did not know why it was taken in two tranches[^23]. I would add a further observation that if the statements were entirely fabricated, it would seem to be somewhat of an overkill to compel the accused to write out a handwritten note (P3) detailing the motorcycles stolen and the accomplices involved, when these details were already captured in the statement. Finally, if the intent was to frame the accused, it was also surprising why the Aprillia motorcycle which the accused had admitted in P3 to have stolen did not materialise into a charge.

64     The fourth and to my mind most fatal doubt in relation to the accused’s allegations is why he did not seize various opportunities to complain to higher authorities and seek help to protect himself from the threats that had been made. It is inexplicable why the accused did not get any help from other officers in the police station, or the doctor who had attended to him on the evening of 25 November 2016[^24] in relation to his complaint about a skin rash. Neither did he raise any complaints to his ex-wife, whom he claimed to be a former police officer, when he made multiple telephone calls to her during his period in remand. The accused’s only explanation was his despondent view that he had been assaulted in a police station previously, and that no one except the court could help him in the face of such a threat. This telling revelation was recorded in the following exchange between the court and the accused[^25]:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes, but -- if you’re beaten, you can yell and somebody could come and help you, right? Would that have been possible, in the interviews on the 29th and the 30th and on the 5th of December?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I cannot make any complaint unless to the Court, uh. Like last time I was beaten, I go to the Court and lift up my shirt. That’s the only time I can report, uh. So, I see the time uh, where they kept me there still so long to go. I have to give in what he says. I ever do that before, Your Honour, I lift the tshirt (sic) in front of the Court---open Court.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So it is your belief that if you’re assaulted in the police station, alright, and you made complaint within the police station to some other officers,---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

It will be some to---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

no one would assist you at all –

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yah

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

to protect you?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

During that time, yes, Your Honour. My thinking is like that at that time, because I lost hope already. When he used the rod, I think of last time. So, the fear there you see, “Okay, lah, I cooperate with you, lah. What you want signed, I sign ah.”

65     The above explanation by the accused naturally begs the question why he did not, by his own reasoning, raise any complaint to the criminal mentions court on the three occasions when his case was heard during the period of remand. The accused first attended at the State Courts on 24 November 2016. He did not at that point complain about the shock and fear he claimed to have experienced during his arrest. His next court appearance was on 1 December 2016, when he could have raised the alleged threats made by SI Lim on 25 November 2016, and the fact that the statements taken on 29 and 30 November 2016 were completely fabricated. He inexplicably failed to do so. Nor did the accused see fit to raise a complaint _after_ the statements were recorded, when he attended at the mentions court one final time on 8 December 2016 during the period of remand. This is all the more surprising as the accused had himself revealed that on the last occasion when he was beaten in remand, he had gone to court and lifted up his shirt to complain. His abject silence before three different district judges on separate court attendances speaks volumes as to the complete and utter lack of credibility of his account.

66     For the above reasons, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at no point during the accused’s remand did SI Lim make the threats of violence as alleged by the accused.

#### Threat to Tender Additional Charges

67     I turn next to the accused’s allegation that SI Lim had on 25 November 2016 threatened to tender 32 additional charges against the accused should he refuse to confess. For the reasons outlined above, I likewise found this allegation to be too far-fetched to be believed. I also considered that this allegation was too remote to constitute a reference to the charge. In _Lim Choon Chye v PP_ \[1994\] 2 SLR(R) at 193, M Karthigesua JA held at \[25\] that an alleged threat to the appellant that he would be investigated for drug activities unconnected with the drug trafficking charge against him was too far removed to constitute an inducement towards the making of his statements. In the present case, the alleged threat to tender 32 charges in relation to _other_ unsolved cases of motorcycle theft against the accused would likewise have no direct relevance to the charges already faced by the accused. Put another way, whether the accused faced additional charges would have made no difference to the likelihood of him escaping the charges he presently faced. It would have been quite different if the threat was to slap on an additional charge based on the same case facts (e.g. where an accused faces a charge for causing hurt and he is threatened with an additional charge of participating in an affray based on the same incident). Where the threatened charges are connected to the existing charge, the accused may feel compelled to confess to one charge rather than be found guilty of two charges. No such pressure would exist in relation to other _unrelated_ charges of motorcycle theft, as the accused would have been aware that no evidence existed to link him to those offences.

68     In support of their contention, the defence raised the case of _PP v Pram Nair_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 880</span>, where the High Court supposedly considered the possibility of invalidating a statement where a threat was made to charge the accused for lying if his denial of a rape charge was proven false. With the greatest respect, I do not think this afforded any visible support to the defence’s case since the High Court duly considered the challenge (in \[45\] – \[59\] of the judgment) and dismissed it. Further, the threat of an additional charge of perjury if a statement given to the police is proven wrong stands on quite a different footing as it did have an indirect reference to the charge in question, and would thus be clearly distinguishable from the alleged threat in the present case to charge the accused with offences completely unrelated to those for which he was being investigated.

#### Inducement by offering of food and the promise of a light sentence

69     The accused suggested that IO Jegajeed had induced him to confess by providing him food and promising to let him call his wife after he confessed[^26]. These allegations were denied by IO Jegajeed, and I found no reason to doubt his explanation that food would not have been allowed in the lock-up. As regards the offer to call his ex-wife should the accused cooperate, it had been held in _Yeo See How v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] SGCA 39</span> at \[36\] that merely permitting the accused to smoke or allowing a visit by family members would not constitute sufficient inducement to render an accused’s statements inadmissible. There was nothing to suggest in this case that the accused’s will was so weak that he would have been swayed by the mere desire for a snack or a call to his ex-wife. Further, such an inducement would not have satisfied the requirement of being a promise having reference to the charge, per Yong Pung How CJ in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGCA 64</span> at \[55\], where it was held that an offer to allow a phone call to the accused’s wife was not a “promise having reference to the charge”, even if one gives a liberal interpretation to the notion of “having reference to the charge” as “relevant or relating to the charge”.

70     With regard to the alleged inducement by SI Jegajeed Singh that the accused should admit to the offences because the sentences would be light and that he could plead for leniency before a Judge, I did not find that this satisfied the requirement that the accused held a reasonable belief that he would “gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature” if he complied. The alleged inducements were clearly not matters within the control or expertise of SI Jegajeed Singh. There were no reasonable grounds to believe that a police officer could have influenced the sentencing outcome in any way. This allegation therefore would not pass muster under s 258(3) of the CPC.

71     For the above reasons, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the challenges made by the accused were not sufficient to render the statements involuntary. I accordingly admitted all nine statements at the end of the ancillary hearing.

### (viii)   The testimony of the accused’s accomplice

72     I turn now to the testimony of the accused’s accomplice, one David Lee Teck Chye.

73     On the stand, David had recanted from what he had admitted to in his plea of guilt (at P12) and in his statements to the police, which were provided to refresh his memory. David maintained that when he took the motorcycles with the accused, the accused did not know that the intent was to steal them[^27], and that therefore was not aiding or abetting the accused in relation to the thefts[^28]. David also claimed that he could not remember if the accused was with him in Ubi or at Sin Ming Drive. With regard to his police statements, he claimed that he was simply asked to sign them, and that he had never mentioned abetment to the police[^29]. As to why he admitted to the aiding and abetting charges in court, David’s account was that he had understood the five charges he had faced were for abetment and that he had told the Mandarin interpreter and his lawyer that he was admitting to theft but not abetment of the accused. However, he claimed that his lawyer just told him to plead guilty and that he would mitigate for him[^30]. He also explained that he had pleaded guilty because he knew that a sentence of preventive detention was sought by the prosecution, and as that could not be backdated, he wanted to start serving the sentence as soon as possible[^31].

74     The prosecution applied to impeach David’s credibility and substitute his SOF in lieu of his testimony in court. I agreed with the prosecution and granted the application. There was clear evidence that Lee was aware that the five charges he faced in court related to abetment. Lee had had numerous opportunities in the court process to object to the charges, but had chosen not to do so. It also seemed incredulous that Lee had shared his objection with both the interpreter and his counsel, and that neither had seen fit to raise these objections to the sentencing judge. I also found it curious that while Lee could remember with a degree of detail specific incidents, he was completely unable to recall whether the accused was even with him in other incidents. This suggested a degree of selective amnesia which called in doubt his credibility. I accordingly agreed with the prosecution that Lee’s credibility was impeached and substituted his oral testimony for his Statement of Facts.

### The Defence’s Case

75     At the close of the prosecution’s case, the accused was called to enter his defence and he elected to give evidence on the stand. He did not call any other witnesses.

76     The accused testified that he was a trader in motorcycles, and would buy motorcycles with expiring Certificates of Entitlement (“COE”) to de-register, after which he would collect any available rebates (such as for the remainder of the COE and road tax). Where the owners of the motorcycles wished to obtain the rebates themselves, he would simply deregister the motorcycles without first transferring ownership to himself. The motorcycles would be dismantled and the parts would be stored at his shop for sale on Carousel (an online platform) to both local and overseas buyers. To support this, the accused adduced a print-out from the Land Transport Authority’s website listing all the vehicles that had been registered in his name between 3 October to 27 December 2016 (in D7), which covered the relevant periods in the 1st to 5th charges.

### (i)   The First to Fifth Charges

77     The accused testified that David was his acquaintance. According to the accused, in 2016, David approached him and said that he had friends with motorcycles to sell.

78     As regards the first to third charges, the accused admitted to having participated in the removal of the motorcycles, but denied any knowledge of the fact that they were stolen. He testified that David had told him of some friends in Woodlands who wanted to sell their motorcycles. With regard to the second charge, they had driven the accused’s rented van to Woodlands, where David showed him a Harley Davidson motorcycle. The accused said that he offered David about $3,000 for it. David then told the accused that he could take the motorcycle first and that he would settle with the owner and obtain the owner’s identity card for the accused. This procedure was similarly adopted for the Suzuki GSX and Yamaha VMAX motorcycles (the subjects of the 1st and 3rd charges respectively).

79     The accused also revealed that when David was driving the van out of the Woodlands carpark with the Suzuki motorcycle loaded in the van, David crashed through and dislodged the barrier at the exit of the car park. The accused revealed that he did not know that David had consumed heroin at that time.

80     To bolster his account in relation to the 1st to 3rd charges, the accused produced an extract from his diary (admitted as D9). An entry dated 19 November 2016 appears to relate to the 2nd charge and reads “David Lee came to tell me his friend wanted to sell a few bikes – I also want to view first and owner I.D.” On 20 November 2016, the entry reads, “Return van already, after Hugger FQ5116R David say his friend selling for 3K. I paid him $500 bal $2500.” This again relates to the motorcycle in the 2nd charge. Finally, on the same day, another entry read, “Ah Tee working till 11.00 pm FBL 393D & FL 358J” (these refer to the motorcycles in 1st and 3rd charges respectively). It was submitted by the defence that the fact that the accused had recorded the registration numbers of the motorcycles involved in the first three charges showed that he did not know they were stolen motorcycles.

81     As regards the 4th charge relating to a motorcycle taken from Ubi, the accused denied having gone to Ubi with David, and testified that David had handed over the motorcycle to him in the course of his business. With regard to the 5th charge, the accused similarly denied any involvement in taking the motorcycle from Sin Ming Drive at all.

82     With regard to the Statement of Facts agreed to by David upon his plea of guilt, the defence contended that this statement could not, as a matter of law, be substituted in lieu of Lee’s testimony in court by virtue of s 258(5) of the CPC and illustration (b) which follows thereafter, both of which read as follows:

> **258(5) –** When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the confession.

> **Illustration (b) -** A is on trial for the murder of C. There is evidence to show that C was murdered by A and B and that B said “A and I murdered C”. This statement may not be taken into consideration by the court against A as B is not being jointly tried.

83     I agreed with the defence that the prosecution cannot rely on a confession statement made to the _police_ by an accomplice unless he is jointly tried at the same trial. This accords with the general prohibition against a witness statement, which is technically a hearsay document, being admissible in a trial save with respect to that given by an accused person, insofar as such statement is specifically admissible under s 258(1) of the CPC. However, I did not find that this prohibition applied to a Statement of Fact admitted in court proceedings. The definition of a confession is provided in s 17(2) of the Evidence Act, which holds that a confession is “an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence”. Nothing in the Evidence Act however suggests that this applies to statements admitted to in court. Neither does a purposive interpretation of this provision support the position taken by the defence, as these provisions in the Evidence Act and the CPC collectively protect an accused from an act of self-incrimination in the investigation process. These concerns would not however apply to admissions made before a judge accepting a plea of guilt. Were the defence to be correct on this point, then no admission made in the course of any criminal proceeding could be made in another set of proceedings where that witness was not a co-accused. This flies in the face of the consistent practice in the criminal court.

### (ii)   The Sixth Charge

84     The accused’s position with respect to the sixth charge was that he paid Maidin $30 to help him get a van to collect a motorcycle which had broken down. He claimed that the bike they recovered was his own bike, a Honda Phantom[^32], and not a Harley Davidson. The accused further shared his suspicions that Maidin had broken into his shop at the Golden Wall Centre while he was under remand[^33].

85     The defence further contended that Maidin was not a trustworthy witness as he had first said in his evidence-in-chief that he was unsure whether the motorcycle he and the accused had recovered was a Harley. He however turned around in cross-examination, after being accused by the defence of breaking into the accused’s shop, that he now clearly remembered the motorcycle taken was a Harley Davidson.

86     As regards the prosecution’s allegation that the accused had interfered with the testimony of Maidin, the accused explained that he had told one “Freddie” that he had met Maidin in court while the latter was waiting to be called to the stand. Unbeknownst to the accused, Freddie had made a phone call to Maidin telling Maidin that he should tell the truth, and that the accused wanted Maidin to call him. However, according to Freddie, Maidin had apparently lost the accused’s mobile number and instead requested that the accused call him[^34]. This was the convoluted reason provided by the accused to account for why he had made a call to Maidin. The accused said that during the call, he asked Maidin why the latter had broken into his shop. The accused also claimed that Maidin said he had been forced by the police to come and give evidence in Court[^35]. However, the accused denied that he had told Maidin to say that the motorcycle they had taken was a Honda Phantom.

### My Decision

87     There were three aspects of this case that confirmed beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused in relation to the tendered charges. These were the statements of the accused, the Statement of Facts admitted to by his accomplice David, and the accused attempted interference with Maidin. I will address each of these grounds in turn.

### (i)   The accused’s statements

88     The statements of the accused comprehensively recorded the accused’s role in the offences. He was able to give details about how he scouted out the motorcycles he wished to steal, roped in the assistance of either David or Maidin, used a plank to roll the motorcycles in the rented or borrowed van, and negotiated for the sale of the motorcycles. He had also recounted in the statements how he had led the police to three of the respective locations to explain where he had found the motorcycles. Were the statements to be accorded full weight, there would be little doubt as to the accused’s guilt on this ground alone.

89     However, the defence had, in the course of the ancillary hearing, alleged that the accused’s statements were not read back to him and therefore should be accorded little weight. It is trite law that the failure to read back a statement does not _ipso facto_ render it inadmissible, although it may have a bearing on the weight to be accorded to such a statement (per _Vasavan Sathidew & 2 Ors v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] SGCA 26</span>, _Panya Mormontree & Ors v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 806</span>).

90     Nevertheless, I found no basis to find that the statements were not read back to the accused. Both SI Jegajeed and SSGT Norazlan testified that they had followed procedure by reading back the statements to the accused, explaining to him the contents of the statements in simple English, especially the implications of the Notice of Warning in the cautioned statements (PS 4-6 and 8-9). There was absolutely no reason to believe that they had cut corners in the manner alleged by the accused. I was therefore inclined to accord the statements their full weight.

### (ii)   Abetment by Lee Teck Chye David

91     The central plank of the accused’s defence to the first to fifth charges was that David was the one who had intended to steal the motorcycles, and that the accused believed he was just helping David move and sell the motorcycles with the respective owner’s permission.

92     This explanation flies in the face of logic for a host of reasons. First, if Lee had permission from the owners to move and sell the motorcycles, it made no sense to move the motorcycles by way of a rented van, as opposed to just riding the motorcycles to the accused’s shop. Indeed, when this question was put to the accused by the court, no coherent reply was given by the accused:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

Why doesn’t David as a broker, go to the location and since he has permission from the owner, get the key and ride the motorbike to your store, instead of bothering with the van? Wouldn’t that be faster and easier?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

No, the, uh---uh, the---if the broker send to me, I’ll buy straightaway. Because at the time, I was desperate to make money, I just buy.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Didn’t it occur to you, that it’s strange, that the broker needs to get a van to transport the bike to your shop, instead of just riding the bike himself, if he has permission of the owner to sell it to you?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Um, I never think of that, Your Honour. Because some people don’t ride the bike, they will ask towing companies to tow to my shop, also same. [^36]

 |

  
  

93     Second, as the accused did sell motorcycles on an “as is” basis, it seemed highly unusual that he did not bother to check the condition of the motorcycles by at least starting their engines, before towing them away to his shop. Again, no coherent response was provided when this question was put to the accused by the court:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

Isn’t it important to you, that you check whether the engine and chassis is working--- whether the engine is working?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Uh---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

If the bike engine is working, then it is of much higher value than the bike engine that is not working, right?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Your Honour, I tell you honestly, I sell do the Indonesian---even the bike not working, they take. The Nigerian also same. The bike, no need to do. “I just take like that”, he say.

 |
| 

 | 

So the price is bargain because they have their own mechanic.[^37]

 |

  
  

94     When it was pointed out that there would be a difference in value depending on whether the motorcycles were working or not, the accused’s response was that he had bought the motorcycles from David at a price on which he could profit whether or not the engine was working. He also added that he was “quite confused” and “very tired” and had simply agreed to buy when offered[^38]. With respect, this explanation makes no sense. The subject matter of the charges involved high-end motorcycles, for which the question of whether they were in working order would conceivably matter greatly to the price. It is inexplicable why neither the buyer nor the seller would bother to turn on the ignition to check the condition of the motorcycle before determining the sale price.

95     Third, David did not come across as a likely broker of luxury motorcycles. He was not in the motorcycle business, and was a dispatch rider who had just been released from prison. The notion that he had friends willing to sell high-end motorcycles at bargain basement prices seems highly improbable.

96     Fourth, the number of red flags that should have been obvious to an experienced dealer such as the accused was absolutely glaring. The owners were not present in any of the transactions, nor were photocopies of their NRICs provided. There was no document of title transferred between the parties, nor was there documentation of the sale price, or indeed any paperwork that would have facilitated deregistration or registration of a transfer of ownership with the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”). Nor was there a physical transference of keys (save for the accused’s unsubstantiated claim that he had been given the keys for the Paya Ubi motorcycle). It is also alarming that the accused proceeded to disassemble or sell the motorcycles before obtaining the express permission of the owners or effecting the necessary transfer with the LTA. Finally, it seemed highly unusual that no proper towing service was engaged, and that a rental van and a makeshift plank were employed to transport the motorcycles, on one occasion with such haste that David had crashed through a car park barrier of the condominium. These red flags should have been patently obvious to the accused, and he must have either known that theft was being committed or at the very least been wilfully blind to its existence. Either way, it cast serious doubt on his account that he was an innocent party who had inadvertently assisted David as the true mastermind behind five of the motorcycle thefts. To the contrary, it was far more apparent that David had merely served as the accused’s assistant in the various motorcycle thefts, being paid a modest fixed fee of $500, as admitted in his Statement of Facts at his plea of guilt.

97     One further point that detracts from the accused’s purported innocence vis-à-vis David is an inconsistency between their accounts in relation to the 4th charge. While the accused claimed that he did not go down to Ubi to take the motorcycle with David, David was adamant that he did not steal the motorcycle by himself and hand it to the accused, and that they had instead gone down to take the motorcycle together[^39]. David also denied that he had put off the handing of the identity cards of the owners to the accused despite requests from the accused[^40]. These inconsistencies further confirm that the account that they had given in court was not to be believed.

98     I should add that I did not consider the accused’s case to be bolstered in any way by his eleventh hour adduction of a handwritten extract of his diary (D9). I found the diary extract to be suspect for a number of reasons. Its existence was never mentioned during the investigation, nor was its existence put to the investigating officer at trial, even though it was a key piece of evidence that could have exonerated the accused. While the document as a whole seems authentic, two of the three exonerating portions appear to have been inserted at the bottom of the page, while the third was squeezed in between two lines. Given its late production, and the self-serving nature of such a document, a cloud of suspicion hangs over the portions cited, given the possibility that they could have been added after the fact. Neither does the diary dispel the clear conclusion that the accused was at best exercising wilful blindness with regard to the numerous red flags presented in the modus operandi of the motorcycle removal.

99     Taken in totality, I found the central plank of the accused’s defence that David was the true mastermind who had tricked him as to the nature of the transactions to be simply implausible.

### (iii)   Interference with Prosecution Witness

100    The spectacular about-turn made by Maidin in open court on the identification of the motorcycle was eclipsed only by his spontaneous revelation that the accused had called him to suborn his testimony in court. A screening with the telecommunications provider revealed that the accused had made a call lasting 17 minutes and 31 seconds to Maidin prior to the latter giving evidence on the stand. When questioned in court, Maidin’s account of the conversation was as follows:

> Q    So, what about Mr. Ho, when he talked to you for 17 minutes? What---what---what did he say?

> A    Is regarding this---“please help me” \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

> Q    Please help you but in---in what way to---to help way?

> A    “Don’t says, it’s a Harley Davidson” \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

> Q    Don’t say it’s a Harley Davidson.

> A    It’s a Phantom \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

> Q    It’s a Phantom.

> A    Hmm.

> Q    Anything else, he asked you to do?

> A    “You know what to do la Din, please, lah.” That’s why when yesterday when the Court ask me, I was very confused, okay. I was very confused. I just say it’s a black bike with no sticker and a fuel tank of Harley Davidson. But I know it’s a Harley Davidson. I was under confusing. But today let me tell the Court, I’m very sorry, I confess. It’s the truth, it a Harley Davidson. And the bike was dusty \[as spoken by Witness in English\].[^41]

101    It seems highly unlikely that the accused would have had a conversation lasting over 17 minutes if all he was doing was asking Maidin to speak the truth as he had claimed.

102    It was evident that the above conversation did succeed initially in persuading Maidin to alter his testimony in favour of the accused. It was only when the defence questioned Maidin about burglarising the accused’s shop that he gave the game up. Had Maidin wished to “fix” the accused by lying, as suggested by the defence, he could easily have done so in his evidence-in-chief itself. Ironically, it was the accused’s own choice to persistently accused Maidin in open court of burglary which tipped the latter over the edge and led him to tell the truth on the spur of the moment.

103    The attempt by the accused to tamper with the evidence of a prosecution is an extremely serious matter. Any attempt to undermine the integrity of the court process, especially by suborning or interfering with the testimony of witnesses, is a matter of utmost gravity and must be met minimally with the requisite adverse inference drawn against such a contemnor. I had no hesitation in drawing such an adverse inference from the actions of the accused.

104    At the close of the trial, I found that the evidence the prosecution had brought against the accused was overwhelming. The admissions made in the accused’s statements alone would have been sufficient to implicate him and prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The accused’s defence that David was the true mastermind and that he was innocent of the thefts was incredulous given the many red flags which presented in this case, and was diametrically opposed to David’s own admitted Statement of Facts at his plea of guilt. However, what took the figurative biscuit was the accused’s brazen interference with a key prosecution witness. No innocent person would have taken the risk of suborning a prosecution witness in such manner unless there was something to hide. To my mind, this act by the accused served to confirm beyond any reasonable doubt that he was clearly guilty of the offences as charged.

### Antecedents

105    It became evident at the sentencing stage that the accused had a long history of repeat offending for theft. A brief summary of his antecedents is provided as follows:

> (a)     In 1986, 1991 and 1993, the accused was convicted on separate occasions of offences relating to the possession of uncensored and obscene video tapes under the Films Act (Cap. 107) and fined on each occasion.

> (b)     In 1995 (when the accused was 41 years old), the accused was convicted of 138 counts of theft under s 379 of the Penal Code, 124 counts of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code, two counts of dishonest receipt of stolen property under s 411 of the Penal Code, and various offences under the Films Act (Cap. 107), National Registration Act (Cap. 201) and Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap. 184). He was given a global sentence of six years and six months imprisonment and $40,000 fine, which was not paid, in default of which he served a further six months of imprisonment.

> (c)     In 2001 (when the accused was 46 years old), he was convicted again for possession of obscene films under s 30(2)(b) of the Films Act (Cap. 107) and fined $10,000, which he paid in full.

> (d)     In 2004 (when the accused was 49 years old), he was convicted of 4 counts of theft of a motor vehicle under s 379A of the Penal Code, one count of using a motor vehicle without valid insurance under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap. 189), and one count for exhibiting a forged, altered or defaced licence plate under s 129(2)(d) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276). He was sentenced to nine years of Corrective Training (“CT”), and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for nine years.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

106    Under s 379A(1) of the Penal Code, a person who commits theft of a motor vehicle shall be punished with a term of imprisonment which may extend to 7 years. The person may also may also be disqualified under s 379A(2) from holding or obtaining a driving licence for such period as the court may order from the date of release of his imprisonment.

107    The relevant precondition for a sentence of CT under s 304(1)(a) of the CPC was clearly met in this case. The accused is aged 18 years or above, has been convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere at least twice since he reached the age of 16 years for offences punishable with such a sentence.

108    The prosecution urged the court to sentence the accused to CT, with the length to be left to the court, as well as disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of vehicles for nine years. The prosecution observed that a sentence of nine years of CT would not be unduly disproportionate given the number of charges that he had been convicted of at trial, and the fact that he they were not seeking an uplift in sentence.

109    The prosecution also pointed out that the accused had re-offended about three years after his release from corrective training (the earliest dated charge in this case being 28 July 2015). There was a need to reform the accused through the rehabilitative programmes available in incarceration, and the fact that corrective training does not carry an automatic right to remission as compared to regular imprisonment would further motivate the accused to reform in order to qualify for the release on licence (“ROL”) scheme (see _Sim Yeow Kee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 209</span> for a discussion of the quantitative difference between corrective training and regular imprisonment at \[17\]).

110    It was also noted that the accused was a persistent and recalcitrant offender. The pre-sentencing report for corrective training for the accused, prepared by the senior psychologist for the Commissioner of Prisons, opined that the accused was in the Moderate Risk/Need level of criminal re-offending and belonged to a group of prisoners with a 30% probability of recidivism within two years of release. There was a need to correct the accused’s tendency to minimise his role in the present offences as well as to stop his offending behaviour. In addition, this would also serve the second aim of CT which was the prevention of crime, as the accused would not be released on licence should he continue to pose a risk to society or be in need of further rehabilitation (per _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[41\]).

### Mitigation Plea

111    The defence asked the court to consider whether the likely imprisonment term the accused would face if he was not sentenced to CT would render the latter unduly disproportionate. It also urged the court to consider that under regular imprisonment, the accused could benefit from the mandatory aftercare scheme (MAS), which could help to monitor the accused’s rehabilitation.

112    It was highlighted by the defence that the value of the motorcycles involved was a moderate value of $66,500, based on estimates provided by the owners. It was noted that some of the motorcycles could not even be started.

113    It was further highlighted that the accused was 65 years at the time of sentencing. With no automatic remission under the CT regime, it was pointed out that he could be released beyond 70, at a late stage of life.

114    Finally, the accused was granted permission to personally plead for leniency before the court. He explained that he was a genuine businessman and entrepreneur who had deregistered 830 vehicles for export out of Singapore. He was also trying to reconcile with his family, and had a son whom he wished to spend time with, and asked the court to consider a lower sentence

### The Sentence

115    The length of corrective training that the court can impose in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment is a period of between five and 14 years. The question that the court has to consider is whether it is expedient with a view to the accused’s reformation and the prevention of crime that he be sentenced to CT. As pointed out by Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[17\], there is no longer any _qualitative_ difference between the corrective training and regular imprisonment today, although there is a _quantitative difference_ in that (i) the minimum statutorily-prescribed term of CT is a period of five years, and (ii) while almost all regular prison inmates would qualify for remission under the Conditional Remission System, only about a quarter of CT inmates would qualify for the ROL, as it remains a discretionary scheme.

116    In _Sim Yeow Kee_ (at \[17(c) to (e)\], the guidance provided by the High Court was as follows:

> (a)     Sentencing courts should prefer CT where it is an available sentencing option, because it is designed to serve the twin goals of reformation of the offender and crime prevention;

> (b)     Where a _shorter_ term of CT is contemplated, (i) the sentencing court should not impose CT if it would result in punishment that is _unduly disproportionate_ to the aggregate term of regular imprisonment which would otherwise likely be imposed; and (ii) the sentencing court should consider the rehabilitative benefits of the MAS being made available to potential CT inmates if they were sentenced instead to regular imprisonment.

117    It is without doubt that CT should be the preferred sentencing option as the accused is clearly eligible, and has already served a previous nine-year term of CT.

118    I next considered whether a term of CT would be disproportionate to a term of imprisonment that would be imposed in the present case. This is the third series of theft and property offences committed by the accused with escalating intensity. The first instalment in 1995 saw him commit 138 counts for theft, 124 counts of cheating, and 2 counts of dishonest receipt of stolen property. The second instalment of offences committed in 2004 involved the more serious charge of motor vehicular theft under s 379A, which provides for a higher maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment. Despite serving nine years of CT (for which he was given a remission of four months), the accused has now committed the same offences, this time involving a higher number of six rather than four charges. Were the accused to be sentenced to imprisonment, I would have had no qualms imposing a sentence of three years’ imprisonment per charge, given the high value of the motorcycles involved and the accused’s history of antecedents. With at least two sentences running consecutively, the accused would have served at least six year’s imprisonment. A sentence of between six to nine years of CT would not therefore have been unduly disproportionate in this case.

119    I further considered whether the rehabilitative benefits of the MAS should nevertheless merit a regular term of imprisonment instead of CT. The MAS is a structured step-down programme to facilitate the transition and reintegration into society of those regular prison inmates released on remission who were likely to present a higher risk of reoffending (at \[46\] of _Sim Yeow Kee_). It comprises three possible components: a halfway house stay, home supervision and community reintegration, with the applicability of each phase dependent on an assessment of the suitability of the offender. Under the First Schedule of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247) read with s 50U(1) of the same, a conviction for an offence under s 379A of the Penal Code would render the accused eligible for the MAS if he was sentenced to a regular term of imprisonment and satisfied the other conditions under s 50U(1).

120    It was pointed out by the learned Chief Justice in _Sim Yeow Kee v PP_ at \[102\] that “(i)f the MAS is applicable and if the court is of the view that it would benefit the offender in question, these factors could cumulatively militate against the imposition of a sentence of CT.” His Honour added that it seemed “illogical to exclude CT inmates from the MAS (which brings with it the prospect of rehabilitation and reintegration into society via a structured step-down approach) when the very reason for considering the imposition of CT, in the first place, is that it would lead to reformation of the offender.

121    In the case of the accused, I noted that he had committed his string of theft and property offences in the flush of youth. He was admittedly an enterprising businessman who, after release from CT, had built up a regular business which did perform legitimate transactions involving motorcycles. In particular, he had gainful skills in and deep knowledge of the disassembly and sale of used motorcycles. It strikes me that the accused was not of insufficient maturity to know the steps he needed to take towards rehabilitation and a crime-free existence. The question was simply the motivation to achieve this. It was my view that such motivation would precisely be provided under the CT regime, where the applicability of ROL is discretionary, and it would be incumbent upon the accused to demonstrate his progress towards rehabilitation in order to benefit from early release. For this reason, I did not find that the availability of MAS would be sufficiently beneficial to merit the imposition of a term of imprisonment rather than CT.

122    In the final reckoning, the natural starting point given the principle of escalation would have been a CT period of at least nine years, especially since the scale of offending was greater in the present case than in 2004. However, I took into account the accused’s age, and the fact that the regular term of imprisonment that would have been imposed in this case would likely have been no more than six years. On balance, I found that a CT term of six years would be sufficient to achieve the twin goals of reformation and crime prevention, while not being overly crushing towards the accused.

123    I accordingly sentenced the accused to six years of CT. With regard to disqualification, I saw no reason to depart from the prosecution’s submission that a disqualification period of nine years be imposed. There was also no specific objection raised by the defence in this regard. I therefore ordered that the accused be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of nine years with effect from his date of release.

124    The accused was directed to surrender at a later date to serve sentence. He filed the present appeal in the interim, and was granted bail pending appeal.

125    It remains for me to thank the learned deputy and counsel for their industry and invaluable assistance in this matter. I am, in particular, grateful for the courtesy and professionalism with which they discharged their duties before the court.
