\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9153/2019/01.\]

4 July 2019

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       This is an appeal filed by the accused, Mr Abdul Muhaikal Bin Abdul Mootalib on 28 June 2019 against his sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment for one charge of being a member of an unlawful assembly under s 143 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev.Ed.). The accused, a 22-year old male Singaporean had pleaded guilty on 20 June 2019 to the following charge in **DAC 912383-2018** namely:

_Exhibit C1A_ – **_1st charge (Amended)_**

“…on the 23 March 2018, at or about 5.30am, at the open carpark in front of Club Envy located at St James Power Station, No. 3 Sentosa Gateway, Singapore, together with Lim Pin Yang, Muhammad Kameil Bin Md Kamisan, and at least 2 other unknown males, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to Neo Zhao Fu Desmond, male 29 years old, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 143 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

## B.   Statement of Facts

2       The Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) tendered by the Prosecution which the accused had admitted to without qualification is as follows:

“**INTRODUCTION**

1.    The accused persons involved in this case are:

a.    B1 - Lim Pin Yang, Male Chinese aged 26 years old.

b.    B2 - Muhammad Kameil Bin Md Kamisan, Male Malay aged 26 years old.

c.    B3 - Abdul Muhaikal Bin Abdul Mootalib, Male Malay aged 22 years old.

d.    At least 2 unknown males.

B1, B2 and B3 are staff members of Club Envy located at St James Power Station. B1 was a Public Relations Executive, while B2 and B3 were bouncers.

2.    The other parties involved in this case are:

a.    A1 - Desmond Neo Zhao Fu, Male Chinese aged 29 years old.

b.    A2 - Regina Toh Jia Wen, Female Chinese aged 21years old. A2 is A1’s wife.

c.    A3 - Choo Jing Hui, Elliott, Male Chinese aged 22 years old. He is a Public Relations Manager at Club Envy and is an acquaintance of A2.

**FIRST INFORMATION REPORT**

3.    On 23 March 2018 at 5.13am, police received a call bearing the message “_10 person beat 1. The guy on the floor_ “. The incident location given was at Blk 3 Sentosa Gateway, St James Power Station Carpark.

**FACTS RELATING TO THE CHARGE – DAC-912383-2018**

4.    Investigations revealed that on 23 March 2018 at about 2am plus, A1 and A2 had separately gone to Club Envy with their respective group. At about 5am, the pair met up and left Club together. A3, being a Public Relations Manager of the Club who had earlier drank and interacted with A2 in the Club, accompanied her out of the Club and chatted with her. While A3 was chatting with A2, A1 got into a verbal altercation with A3. The dispute then turned physical, and A1 punched A3.

5.    The altercation attracted the attention of other Club staff, who learnt that A3 had been attacked. About 10 people, including B1, B2 and B3, arrived in the vicinity. They did not know A1 and A2.

6.    A few unknown male subjects amongst the 10 people then approached A1 and started attacking A1 by kicking and punching him. Upon seeing this, B1 joined in to attack A1. He first obtained a plastic traffic wand from the Club valet and used the wand to hit A1 on the side of the body. The traffic wand broke as a result. B1 then kicked A1 twice, when A1 was already on the floor. At some point during the incident, B2 and B3 also joined in the assault on A1. In particular, B3 kicked A1 once and also joined the group to stomp on A1 after he had fallen onto the ground. B2 and B3 only stopped when another Club staff pushed them away and told them not to get involved further. The group is thus an Unlawful Assembly which common object of the members was to cause hurt to A1, and by joining in to attack A1, B3 formed part of the Unlawful Assembly.

7.    While A1 was being attacked, A2 tried to intervene to stop the attack. As a result, some blows dealt by members of the Unlawful Assembly landed on her. In a bid to stop the attack, A2 offered to leave her phone number so that the matter may be “settled” the next day. The attack then ceased, and A1 and A2 left the scene.

8.    After the incident, A1 sought medical treatment at Singapore General Hospital. He was seen by Dr Lim Mian Jie on 23 March 2018, at 6.10am, and was observed to have suffered the following injuries:

a.    A haematoma over his occiput;

b.    1 cm laceration over his right parietal scalp;

c.    Multiple puncture wounds over his back;

d.    3 cm laceration over his right supraorbital region;

e.    2 puncture wounds over his right humerus area;

f.    Tenderness of his left anatomical snuffbox; and

g.    A superficial puncture wound over his right thigh; and

h.    Mild soft tissue gas in the region of his right biceps brachii.

A1 was diagnosed to have assault with multiple puncture wounds and head injury. He was treated with analgesia and anti-tetanus toxoid. Toilet and suture was done over his puncture and laceration wounds. He was given 1 week of medical leave.

9.    A2 also sought treatment at Singapore General Hospital. She was seen by Dr Jeremy Ng Chung Fai, who observed the following injuries on her:

a.    Multiple bruises; and

b.    A fracture of her right 5th rib with an associated pneumothorax.

10.    A3 also sought treatment at Singapore General Hospital. He was seen by Dr Seah Zeyen, and was observed that he had a superficial abrasion over the right upper lip and mild tenderness over his nasal bone. He was discharged with analgesia and nose drop, and was given outpatient medical leave for 3 days.

11.    By virtue of the foregoing, B3 has committed an offence of being a member of an Unlawful Assembly punishable under s 143 of the Penal Code.

## C.   Antecedents

3       The Accused is untraced.

## D.   Prosecution’s Address On Sentence

4       In its oral address on sentence, the Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of at least four weeks. It was submitted that the aggravating factors in this case were:

a)     This was a large group assault which involves a large number of ten males assaulting the victim;

b)     The injuries suffered by the victim were not insignificant or minor. There were not only superficial injuries but also puncture wounds.

5       The Prosecution further submitted that the following factors were more specific to the accused namely:

a)     He had only joined the assault after seeing the larger group begin their assault;

b)     The accused not only kicked the victim but proceeded to stomp on him after he had fallen to the ground;

c)     The accused was employed as a bouncer at Club Envy. His main role was to maintain order and security in the club and its premises. In the present case, the accused had done the complete opposite;

d)     The accused only stopped his assault when he was pulled away by another staff member of the club and told not to get involved further.

#### Sentencing Precedents

6       In support of its address on sentence, the following cases were relied upon by the Prosecution:

7       It was submitted in _PP v Lawrence Sim Jia Wei_, the accused was 21 years’ old at the time of the offence and sentencing. It was highlighted that likewise, this was a group act where there were multiple persons assaulting the victim. The court had imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment on that accused and he was also untraced.

8       It was further submitted that the case of _PP v Koh Siong Ling_ also involved an accused who was 21 years’ old at the time of the offence and 22 years’ old at the time of sentencing much like the present accused. In that case, the assault on the victim was much more protracted and the accused had taken part in multiple parts of the assault and his culpability was more involved than the accused in this case. It was highlighted the injuries were largely similar albeit without lacerations and puncture wounds. The accused in that case was also untraced and sentenced to 8 weeks’ imprisonment.

9       It was the Prosecution’s case that there were similarities between the two cases cited and the present case namely:

a)     The age of the accused persons was on the threshold of 21 years’ old or had barely crossed it at the time of sentencing;

b)     The injuries were relatively minor involving bruising or scratching but in the present case slightly more severe involving lacerations and puncture wounds;

c)     All three accused persons were untraced at the time of sentencing.

10     It was submitted that in line with these precedents where imprisonment of one month to 8 weeks’ were imposed, the Court was urged to impose a custodial sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment. I was informed that the co-accused, Lim Pin Yang had been convicted and sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment to a similar charge under s 143 Penal Code in Court 6 on 11 March 2019. As for the co-accused, Muhammad Kameil Bin Md Kamisan, his matter was still outstanding and that he faced additional charges in addition to this present related charge.

## E.   Mitigation

11     It was submitted by the Defence that the accused is presently 22 years’ old and was 21 years’ old at the time he committed the offence. His biological parents are divorced and he was brought up by his mother, an accountant and his stepfather, a security officer at Ardmore Park condominium. He also lives with two younger siblings aged 19 years old and 8 years’ old respectively. Recently, the accused got married on 25 December 2018 and is now a proud father to a ten- week’ old child.

12     The accused is the sole breadwinner to his wife and new born child. He also assists financially to support his mother, stepfather and siblings. He had entered the work force at an early age after completing his National Service (“NS”) obligations with the Traffic Police Division of the Singapore Police Force.

13     It was submitted that upon the completion of his NS, he had intended to join the Traffic Police on a full time basis but was unable to meet the minimum educational criteria. The accused found part- time employment as a Security Administrative Officer at Club Envy at St. James Power Station in late 2017. He then worked at the club on a full time basis until August 2018, shortly after the incident.

#### Incident at Club Envy

14     It was the case for the Defence that the accused reported and took instructions from the Security Manager, one Mr Muhammad Fadhil Bin Aziz (“Fadhil”). This was his first job after completion of his NS and he did not receive any specific training. According to the Defence, the club did not have or briefed the accused on any incident protocols. He was to follow Fadhil’s instructions and to remove unruly patrons from the premises.

15     On the day of the incident, after the victim, Desmond Neo had punched Choo Jing Hui, Elliott, the Public Relations Manager at Club Envy, both the accused and his co-accused, Muhammad Kameil Bin Md Kamisan (“Kameil”) had arrived at the scene. According to his Counsel, Fadhil had instructed both of them not to get involved and both men escorted Elliot to the club’s entrance, leaving Fadhil to manage the victim.

16     It was submitted that the victim then suddenly punched Fadhil. Seeing this, the accused and Kameil returned to Fadhil to assist him in restraining the victim. Nevertheless, the victim managed to escape and had pushed Fadhil down the stairs when the latter attempted to follow him. A group of 10 male Chinese confronted the victim and fight broke out between them.

17     According to his Counsel, in the course of this fighting breaking out the accused experienced an unfortunate loss of composure. The victim’s actions towards Elliot and Fadhil were forefront on his mind when he joined the group and momentarily kicked the victim twice. It was submitted that the accused’s involvement in the scuffle did not extend beyond these two kicks. Fadhil pushed both the accused and Kameil away and asked them not to get involved. Eventually the fight dispersed and the group of Chinese males left the scene.

18     It was further submitted that upon noticing that the victim was visibly injured, the accused and one of the club’s owners approached the victim and his wife, Regina and offered to call an ambulance. The couple declined the offer and departed in a taxi.

#### A Probation Order is Appropriate in Muhaikal’s Case

19     In essence, it was the case for the Defence that (i) considering the circumstances of the offence, (ii) the primacy of rehabilitation as the relevant sentencing objective and (iii) the accused’s strong propensity for rehabilitation, a probation order may the appropriate sentence in this case. The Court was requested to call for a pre-sentencing report to assess the accused’s suitability to undergo probation.

20     It was submitted that the accused was 21 years’ old at the time of the commission of the offence and should be treated as a youthful offender such that rehabilitation remains the primary sentencing objective. In support of their submissions, Counsel had relied on the two-stage sentencing approach for sentencing youthful offenders in the High Court case of _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ \[2018\] 5 SLR 1289. It was further submitted that the accused is now 22 years old and there has not been significant delay between the time of the commission of the offence and his sentencing.

21     It was also submitted that the accused has made active efforts to get his life on track. It was the case for the Defence that the steps the accused had taken to recover from a difficult point in his life, make amends and move forward as a strong and more mature professional demonstrates his capacity to reform.

22     It was the case for the Defence that the accused’s rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix for the present case. It was acknowledged by the Defence that the primacy of rehabilitation may be diminished or eclipsed by considerations of deterrence or retribution where[^1]:

a)     the offence is serious;

b)     the harm caused is severe;

c)     the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; and/or

d)     the conditions which made rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable do no exist.

23     It was submitted that the severity of an offence and the corresponding punitive response that this calls for is calibrated by considering the culpability of the offender’s conduct and the harm caused by the offence[^2]. It was further submitted that the accused’s culpability was on the lower end of the spectrum for the following reasons:

a)     there was no pre-meditation on the accused’s part. His involvement in the incident happened spontaneously;

b)     there was a degree of provocation of the victim’s part albeit not towards the accused himself. As far as the accused was concerned, the accused was the initial aggressor and had physically attacked Elliot and Fadhil;

c)     his involvement in the incident was limited to kicking the victim twice;

d)     his actions were attributable to his immaturity and perhaps a misguided sense of protectiveness towards his colleagues. The accused should not be held to the standard of an older security officer who may have had the benefit of experience and training. The accused’s youth and inexperience were relevant in appreciating his impulsive reaction;

e)     there are no other aggravating factors present in the commission of the incident other than the necessary constituent elements to make out the charge itself.

f)     Fadhil had attested that this was a one-off incident and out of character for the accused.

24     The Defence accepted that in terms of the harm caused, the accused bears liability for the injuries inflicted on the victim by the other members of the group. It was orally agreed that the harm caused to the victim was serious but not severe. The victim had suffered puncture wounds and lacerations and there was no serious harm caused or lasting damage. Nevertheless, it was highlighted that while the victim was admitted to the hospital, he was released within the day. It was again emphasized that the accused had only aimed two kicks at the victim and was not directly responsible for the injuries suffered by Regina.

#### Sentencing Precedents

25     It was highlighted that the Prosecution had made reference to some precedents for s143 Penal Code cases involving young offenders in which imprisonment terms were imposed. Likewise, the Defence had tabulated precedent cases where probation orders have been made which were similar or more egregious than the present case. I noted that in three of the cases, namely _PP v Chen Zhi Qiang Allan_ (MA 146/96), _Felicia Soon Pei Ling v PP_ (MA 218/2003) and _Lim Liang Wei v PP_ (MA 118/2006), all the offenders were below 21 years of age and the offences were prior to the 1 February 2008 enhancement of the punishment for offences under s 143 Penal Code. The prescribed punishment then was a term of imprisonment which may extend to _six months_’ or with fine or to both. The only sentencing precedent involving an offender aged 21 was _Zhou Ran v PP_ (MA 97/2008). From the court records, the offence was committed on 11 December 2007 which was prior to the enhancement of the prescribed punishment under s 143 Penal Code.

26     It was argued that looking at the facts of the precedents gives an idea of the offence specific factors but not the offender specific factors. It was emphasized that there was no information on the offenders in the cases as to whether they had propensity for reform.

27     Finally, it was submitted that the accused is not a hardened criminal or recalcitrant. He was untraced and this was his first brush with the law. For this reason, it was further submitted that there is no specific reason for specific deterrence to be emphasized in the present case.

#### Alternative Sentencing Options

28     In the alternative, it was submitted that should the Court not be minded to consider probation and call for a probation suitability report, the Court could consider the imposition of one of the combination of community based sentences including a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) to achive the twin sentencing objectives of rehabilitation and deterrence. In support of this submission, the Defence relied on the case of _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v Public Prosecutor_ \[2016\] SGHC 174 where the accused who was 25 years’ old at the material time was eventually sentenced to a SDO and a community service order.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

29     In response to the Defence’s submissions on what the sentencing consideration for this case should be, it was highlighted that in _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_, the Honourable the Chief Justice had handed a judgment to explain how the Court should approach the need for rehabilitation in youthful offenders. It was submitted that in that case, the High Court had considered the two rationales where rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing consideration at \[47\]. The first factor is the retrospective rationale which justifies giving a young offender excusing his actions on the basis of youthful folly and inexperience. The second rationale is the prospective rationale which focuses on discouraging further offending on the basis that such young offenders are more receptive to the sentencing regimes aimed at altering their values and hopefully society will benefit from the rehabilitation of such offenders.

30     It was further submitted that after highlighting these two rationales, the Chief Justice had gone on to observe where offenders were 21 or below at the time of the offence but above the age at the time of sentencing, the prospective rationale would not apply strongly, if at all while the retrospective rationale would continue to be relevant.

31     It was the Prosecution’s case that in this case lesser weight should be given to the retrospective rationale. The accused was at the highest end of the age range explained by the Chief Justice which is 21 years’ old. The Prosecution expressed its doubts as to whether the accused can rely on his youthful folly and inexperience given that he has and he was employed and he knowingly joined the job as a security officer. He had served the prior two years with the Traffic Police doing enforcement work. On this basis, it was submitted that general deterrence and retribution should continue to take centre stage in this case.

## G.   The Sentence

32     The prescribed punishment for an offence of being a member of an unlawful assembly under s 143 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev.Ed.) is a term of imprisonment which may extent to 2 years or to a fine or to both.

33     In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a custodial term of at least four weeks’ imprisonment on the basis of the aggravating factors present and the offender specific factors. In contrast, even though the accused was above 21 years of age at the time of sentencing, the Defence had urged the Court to call for a pre-sentence report for probation. In the alternative, if the Court was not minded to consider probation and to call for a probation suitability report, it was submitted that the Court could consider the imposition of one of the combination of community based sentences including a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) to achive the twin sentencing objectives of rehabilitation and deterrence.

#### Should a pre-sentence report have been called in the present case?

34     In my consideration on the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I was mindful that it is trite that a probation order accords primacy to the principle of rehabilitation: see _PP v Lim Chee Yin Jordon_ \[2018\] 4 SLR 1294 at \[29\]. A court would have to be satisfied that rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing principle in order for a probation order to be justified. At \[31\] of the same case, it was further stated that the High Court in _PP v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ \[2017\] 5 SLR 671 held at \[6\]–\[7\] that the law takes a presumptive view that with young offenders, the primary sentencing consideration is rehabilitation, but that this is not presumptively the case with an older offender. It is clear from case law that the probation is the exception rather than the norm for adult offenders.

35     In the present case, the Accused was not a young offender below the age of 21 years but was four months’ shy of turning 22 years’ of age when the offences were committed on 23 March 2018. In addition, when he was sentenced on 20 June 2019, it was 17 days away from his 23rd birthday. At the time of the offence, the accused was working full time as a Security Administrative Officer at Club Envy. He had also completed his two years of National Service with the Traffic Police of the Singapore Police Force on 11 November 2017. I noted that the accused had received basic police training and would have been trained in law enforcement. I was also mindful that in his Singapore Police Force Service Transcript exhibited in his mitigation, it was reflected that “_He is a mature and a very effective and co-operative officer who is able to maintain excellent relationship with his fellow colleagues_.”

36     On the above facts, I did not accept the Defence’s contention that the accused’s youth and inexperience were relevant in appreciating his impulsive reaction. I agreed with the Prosecution that in the present case lesser weight should be given to the retrospective rationale in _Karthik_’s case. Based on the factual matrix of the present case, I was not minded to call for a pre-sentence report for probation due to the serious nature of the present charge as well as the aggravating factors present in this case. Furthermore, I did not think that there were any exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation in the present case. I agreed with the Prosecution that general deterrence and retribution should continue to take centre stage in this case.

37     I then went on to consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused for the present charge. His co-accused, Lim Pin Yang (“Lim”) who was 26 years old at the time of the offence, had been convicted and sentenced to _5 weeks’ imprisonment_ for a similar charge under s 143 Penal Code. Lim had used a plastic traffic wand from the club valet to hit the victim on the side of his body. The traffic wand broke as a result and he had also kicked the victim twice, when the latter was already on the floor.

38     The Prosecution had tendered four recent unreported cases and a dated precedent where the offence was committed in 2007 before the enhancement to the prescribed punishment. In the absence of any reasoned judgments in these precedents, I did not place much reliance on these precedents although they shed some light on the range of sentences imposed in similar cases. I did not find the sentencing precedents tendered by the Defence particularly useful as most of the cases referred to involved offenders who were below 21 years of age and in all of the cases, the offences were committed prior to the enhanced punishment in 2008.

39     In my assessment of the accused’s culpability, I took into account the fact that the accused was a first offender and had pleaded guilty to the proceeded charge. Unlike Lim, he had not used any weapon to assault the victim. I disagreed with the Defence that the accused’s culpability was at the lower end of the spectrum. The accused was employed as Security Administrative Officer (or in common parlance “a bouncer”) and as highlighted by the Prosecution, his main role was to maintain order and security in the club. This included the removal of unruly patrons from the club’s premises. Instead on the day in question he had joined in the melee after the larger group began their assault on the victim.

40     From paragraph 6 of the Statement of Facts, it was undisputed that the accused had kicked the victim once and had also joined the group to stomp on the victim after he had fallen onto the ground. He had only stopped his assault on the victim when another club staff, presumably Fadhil, had pushed the assailants included the accused away and told them not to get involved further.

41     I did not accept that there was a degree of provocation on the victim’s part as there were none directed by the victim at the accused himself. Although the victim had thrown the first punch at Fadhil, on at least two occasions Fadhil, the accused’s Security Manager had instructed the accused and Kameil not to get involved. I disagreed with the Defence’s submissions that the accused should not be held to the standard of an older security officer who may have had the benefit of experience and training. Although it was unchallenged the accused had not received specific training or briefed on incident protocols by the club, the fact remains that the accused had received police training and would have attained some experience in law enforcement during his period of National Service.

42     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that there were aggravating factors namely that this was a large group assault involving at least 10 males assaulting the victim and the injuries suffered by the victim were not minor. In addition, under such circumstances the other patrons who were present at the pub would have been put in fear for the personal safety. Hence, the level of harm could not be considered as low but that at a medium level. In my view, after assessing the accused’s level of culpability and the harm caused, the custodial threshold had indeed been crossed in the present case.

43     After a careful consideration, in view of the dominant sentencing principle of general deterrence, the aggravating factors, the mitigating factors as well as the culpability of the accused and the harm caused by the offence, I was of the view that a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment for **DAC 912382-2018** would be just and approporiate in the present case.

44     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against his sentences on 28 June 2019. On 20 June 2019, after I had sentenced the accused, his Counsel had indicated his intention to file an appeal against my decision. I had offered bail pending appeal of $20,000 with one surety but the accused had elected to begin serving his sentence on 20 June 2019. He is currently in Cluster C and his earliest date of release is on **9 July 2019**.
