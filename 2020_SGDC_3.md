13 January 2020

### District Judge Chee Min Ping:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mr Chong Sher Shen, faced five charges. The prosecution applied to proceed with two charges, DAC-928865-2019 and DAC-928866-2019, and to stand down the remaining three charges. The accused claimed trial to the two proceeded charges, _viz_,

> (a)     Driving whilst under disqualification under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“Road Traffic Act”), punishable under s 67A(1) of the Road Traffic Act; and

> (b)     Using a motor vehicle without a valid third party motor insurance policy under s 3(1) read with s 3(2), punishable under s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“Motor Vehicles Act”).

At the conclusion of the trial, the accused was convicted of the two charges and sentenced to an aggregate of 10 months’ imprisonment and 30 years’ disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences. The accused has appealed against conviction and sentence.

## Charges

2       The first charge under s 43(4), punishable under s 67A(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA Charge”) is set out as follows:

> You, \[Chong Sher Shen\], are charged that you, on 23 July 2015, at or about 4.40 pm, along Pan Island Expressway towards Tuas, Singapore, whilst under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of motor vehicles for a period of 14 years with effect from 4 June 2009 to 3 June 2023, did drive a motor van bearing licence plate number: GBA4162K, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed), and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, had been convicted on at least 2 previous occasions for offences under s 43(4) of the said Act, to wit:

>> (a)    On 4 June 2009, in Subordinate Court No 21, you were convicted for an offence of driving whilst under disqualification under s 43(4) of the said Act, vide DAC 23623-2008; and

>> (b)    On 21 July 2005, at Subordinate Court 21, you were convicted of an offence of driving whilst under disqualification under s 43(4) of the said Act, vide DAC 17335-2005,

> which convictions have not been set aside to date, and you are therefore liable for enhanced punishment under s 67A(1)(a) of the said Act.

3       The second charge under s 3(1) read with s 3(2) and punishable under s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act (“MVA Charge”) is set out as follows:

> You, \[Chong Sher Shen\], are charged that you, on 23 July 2015, at or about 4.40pm, along Pan Island Expressway towards Tuas, Singapore, did drive a motor van bearing licence plate number: GBA4162K, whilst there was not in force in relation to the user of the said vehicle, such a policy of insurance in respect of third-party risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) and you have thereby committed an offence under s 3(2) of the said Act.

## Prosecution’s case

4       The prosecution’s case is summarised as follows. At the material time, PW1, Senior Principal Enforcement Officer Ng Chiong Peng from the Land Transport Authority, saw the accused driving a motor van bearing registration number GBA4162K (“Van”) along the Pan-Island Expressway (“PIE”) in the direction of Tuas, near Eng Neo Avenue. As the Van did not display ownership markings on both sides of the vehicle, PW1 signalled to the accused to stop the Van. The accused pulled over at the chevron markings between the Bukit Batok Expressway and the PIE. PW1 then requested for the accused’s NRIC and driver’s licence, but the accused only produced his NRIC. PW1 then submitted the accused’s NRIC number to the LTA headquarters for screening. PW1 was then informed that the accused was subject to a disqualification from driving. PW1 took four photographs of the accused and the Van at the chevron markings. PW1 then called for a tow truck to tow the Van to a nearby carpark along Dairy Farm Road, where he waited for Traffic Police to arrive. While waiting, PW1 took two more photographs of the Van at the said carpark. All 6 photographs were admitted and marked P1-1 to P1-6 respectively.

5       PW2, Staff Sergeant Tan Jun Yan, a Traffic Police Officer, was then deployed to the carpark along Dairy Farm Road. According to PW2’s evidence-in-chief, PW2 was activated by Traffic Police Operations to attend at the car park near Dairy Farm Road to investigate into a suspected case of driving under disqualification on 23 July 2015. Upon arrival, PW2 spoke to PW1 to understand the facts of the case, and to the accused. PW2 asked if the accused knew that he was under a disqualification from driving, and the accused stated that he knew that he was under disqualification.[^1] PW2 then requested for a patrol car and police resource to effect the arrest of the accused. PW3, Staff Sergeant Abdul Rahman bin Amir Ho, and one NS Special Constable Shariz (“SC Shariz”) arrived at the scene in a police patrol car shortly after. PW2 handed the accused over to PW3 and SC Shariz, who placed the accused under arrest, conducted a search on the accused, and then escorted the accused back to the Traffic Police Headquarters in a police car. After they arrived at the police station, PW3 lodged an arrest report, which was marked and admitted P2.

6       PW4, Senior Station Inspector Kasmawati Samian, testified that she was the investigation officer for the accused’s case. On 23 July 2015, PW4 performed screening on the accused and obtained the Notification of Disqualification and Convictions, which was referred to in these proceedings as the “Form L”. The Form L was a notification from the District Court to the OC (Traffic Police), that the accused was disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles from 4 June 2009 until 3 June 2023 for offences committed under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act for which he was convicted on 4 June 2009. The Form L was admitted and marked P3.

7       Through PW4, the accused’s statement recorded on 20 November 2015 under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“Criminal Procedure Code”) was admitted as P4. Two statements recorded on 23 July 2015 under s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code were admitted as P5 and P6 respectively. In P4, the accused did not seek to raise any facts pertaining to the material time, _ie_, the afternoon of 23 July 2015. However, the accused indicated in P4 that he was never convicted of any driving related offences in 1977. In P4, the accused also confirmed that he was previously convicted and sentenced for driving whilst under disqualification from driving in 2001 and 2005. In P5 and P6, the accused, after having been informed of the charges against him, and being administered a notice of warning, stated, “I have nothing to say”.

8       The prosecution’s last witness was Mr Christopher Chionh (PW5), the Head of Motor Claims Department from AXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd. PW5 explained that the motor insurance policy that was in force in respect of third party risks for the Van would not cover a driver without a valid driving licence.[^2] From PW5’s search conducted on the database of the General Insurance Association, there was no other motor insurance policy in force in respect of the Van.

## The Accused’s Applications for Summonses to Witnesses

9       At the close of the prosecution’s case, the accused applied for the issuance of three summonses for witnesses to attend court, in respect of a Deputy Public Prosecutor who previously handled this case, one Court Officer from the State Courts, and one Prosecuting Officer from the Traffic Police who handled the accused’s case in 1998.[^3] These applications were heard before the accused gave evidence in his defence. Essentially, the accused asserted that these individuals were required as witnesses because he wanted to find out when the prosecution first discovered that there were antecedents for offences in 1977 erroneously entered in his criminal records (“CRO”). In particular, the accused wished to enquire whether the prosecution had known prior to 1998 that the 1977 antecedents recorded in the accused’s CRO were erroneously entered.[^4] He also explained that the witnesses were necessary to explain the obstacles encountered in obtaining the 1977 court records, and that they had “implanted wrong antecedents to enhance seriousness towards my initial case”[^5].

10     The prosecution objected to these applications, on the basis that these witnesses’ evidence would have no bearing on the issue of whether the offences as charged were committed in 2015. The prosecution also highlighted that the accused’s arguments in relation to the summonses were a rehash of the same arguments that the accused had already made in a Criminal Revision before the High Court and a Criminal Motion before the Court of Appeal. Referring to _Chong Sher Shen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 35</span> (“_Chong Sher Shen (CA)”_), the prosecution submitted that the accused had argued that the erroneous recording of antecedents in 1977 in his CRO had somehow resulted in a snowballing effect in the sentences for all the offences he committed in 1998 and subsequent years. The Court of Appeal had heard the accused’s arguments, and found that there was no merit in the accused’s application to set aside his convictions and sentences for driving and third party insurance related offences subsequent to 1977. It was also pointed out by the prosecution and accepted by the accused that the 1977 antecedents had been expunged from the accused’s CRO before the Criminal Revision proceedings had even been heard.

11     I understood the accused’s alternate objection to be that the 1977 antecedents should have been marked with an annotation such as “entered in error”, and not entirely expunged from the record.[^6] The accused’s suggestion as to the best way to rectify the error in his CRO was, however, unrelated to the issues before the court at this trial. I was unable to see how the evidence of the three witnesses the accused sought summonses for would be relevant to any fact in issue during the trial. The accused’s arguments relating to whether the erroneous entries in his CRO of 1977 antecedents would result in the setting aside of his prior convictions for traffic offences have also been ventilated before and dealt with by the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, I dismissed the accused’s applications for summonses.

## Defence’s case

12     The accused gave evidence in his defence. I understood the defence to be as follows: but for the erroneous recording of 1977 antecedents in the accused’s CRO (including a disqualification from driving for one year), the court would not have imposed a two years’ disqualification in 1998 for the offence of permitting another to use a motor vehicle without insurance coverage under s 3(1) punishable under s 3(2) and 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act. I also understood the accused’s position to be that therefore, that the 1998 offences would not have resulted in him losing his driver’s licence, and thus he would have had a valid driver’s licence in the years subsequently, including at the material time, 23 July 2015.

13     The accused stated that he had applied in March 2017 to obtain the court records for the 1977 antecedents. In respect of this application, the accused asserted that he had been told by the court and DPP that there were no records. However, he obtained the court records in July 2017, which proved that the 1977 antecedents were indeed wrongly recorded in his CRO, as the relevant antecedent offences were proven to have been committed by individuals other than the accused. The accused again reiterated that he needed to subpoena witnesses to prove that it had not been straightforward to obtain records for the antecedents in 1977 which were wrongly recorded. The prosecution did not contest the accused’s account in relation to his application for court records for the 1977 antecedents, or take issue with the authenticity of supporting documents tendered by the accused in relation to the application for the relevant court records.[^7]

14     At the conclusion of the defence’s case, the accused requested for a summons to be issued to one Mr Lim Lam Chua (“Mr Lim”), so that Mr Lim can testify as to whether Mr Lim, the driver of the relevant vehicle in 1998, had “implicated” the accused for the offence of permitting Mr Lim to drive without third party insurance. The accused submitted that if Mr Lim had not implicated the accused, the fact that the accused was charged in 1998 for permitting Mr Lim to drive a vehicle without third party insurance was a matter of grave injustice and indicates an “internal administrative conspiracy”.[^8] The accused also urged the court to issue a summons to a Justice of Peace,[^9] so that the Justice of Peace may testify on the issue of what is in the public interest. The accused explained that he disagreed with the Court of Appeal’s assessment in _Chong Sher Shen (CA)_ that there was no question of law of public interest raised in his Criminal Motion application. I declined to issue the summonses as requested, as the evidence of these witnesses have no bearing on the facts in issue in this trial.

## Issues and Decision on the Charges

##### (a)   The RTA Charge

15     In _Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1028</span> (“_Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail_”) at \[23\] and \[25\], the High Court held that s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act created a singly strict liability offence of driving under disqualification. To make out the offence, it was necessary to prove only that the accused had driven under disqualification. Thus, to prove the RTA charge, the prosecution was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that (a) the accused was subject to disqualification from driving at the material time, and (b) the accused had driven at the material time. As the RTA Charge carried enhanced punishment under s 67A of the Road Traffic Act of triple the punishment prescribed by s 43(4), the prosecution was also required to prove that the accused had committed two prior specified offences under the RTA.

16     The accused’s disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles imposed on 4 June 2009 for a period of 14 years was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. P3 was a notice from the District Court to the OC (Traffic Police) that the accused was disqualified for a period of 14 years with effect from 4 June 2009. It was also clear from the accused’s statement to the police P4, recorded on 20 November 2015 and the accused’s evidence at the trial that the accused did not dispute that in 2009, there was a disqualification order imposed on the accused from driving all classes of motor vehicles.

17     The fact that the accused had driven the Van at the material time was also proven beyond a reasonable doubt and was undisputed by the accused. PW1 had witnessed the accused driving the Van at the material time without ownership markings and proceeded to stop the accused. PW1 also took pictures at the chevron markings where the accused stopped after being pulled over along the PIE, which was evidence that the accused was the person who was stopped at the material time. In particular, exhibit P1-1 bore the date/time stamp “23.07.2015 16:40 hrs”.

18     During the accused’s evidence-in-chief, he was concerned to highlight the inconvenience and obstacles that he had experienced in the process of obtaining documentation concerning the 1977 antecedents,[^10] and asserted that the Investigation Officer (PW4) ought to have ascertained the accuracy of his CRO entries during the process of investigations. These matters had no bearing on the issue of whether the accused had driven the Van while a disqualification order was in force against him.

19     The accused’s defence raises the issue of whether the erroneous recording of the 1977 antecedents in his CRO had somehow caused the disqualification periods for his subsequent offences to be wrongfully inflated or lengthened. Relatedly, if the disqualification imposed on him in 1998 was wrongfully inflated or lengthened, the issue was whether all the subsequent disqualification orders imposed on him were valid. The accused’s arguments in relation to these issues had been raised before the High Court and Court of Appeal, in criminal revision and criminal motion proceedings respectively, and rejected. In _Chong Sher Shen (CA)_, the Court of Appeal gave detailed grounds for finding the accused’s applications to set aside convictions for offences in 1998 and subsequent years, including the convictions of the accused for driving while under disqualification in 2005 and 2009 respectively to be unmeritorious.

20     As stated in \[15\] above, in _Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail_, the High Court has clarified that an offence under s 43(4) of Road Traffic Act is a singly-strict liability offence. In the present case, as it had been proven that the accused had driven a motor vehicle at the material time while there was a valid disqualification order against him, the accused was found guilty of the RTA Charge and convicted accordingly. The accused’s defence related to the extent of his culpability for disregarding the disqualification order (see below at \[27\] – \[34\]) that subsisted against the accused at the material time. However, _why_ he had disregarded the disqualification order was irrelevant to the question of whether the RTA Charge had been made out in this case.

##### (b)   The MVA Charge

21     As for the MVA Charge, the prosecution had to prove that at the material time, (a) the accused drove the Van, and (b) there was no insurance policy in force in respect of third party risks. For the reasons articulated above at \[17\], I found that the accused had indeed been driving the Van at the material time. The evidence of PW5 revealed that while there was an insurance policy for third party risks for the Van, the policy did not cover drivers who did not possess a valid driving licence. Given that the accused was under disqualification from driving all classes of motor vehicles at the material time, it follows that the accused had been driving whilst there was no valid insurance policy against third party risks in respect of his use of the Van. Thus, the MVA Charge was made out beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted him on the MVA Charge.

## Submissions on sentence

23     The prosecution highlighted that the accused had repeatedly flouted disqualification orders against him. While the accused had repeatedly harped on hardship caused by the erroneous entry of the 1977 antecedents, which apparently had a knock-on effect on the subsequent disqualification imposed in 1998 for subsequent offences, the prosecution pointed out that the accused could have obtained a driving licence after the 1998 disqualification expired. He chose not to do so, and thus, any pain and suffering he claimed to have consequentially suffered, if any, were caused by his own inaction alone.

24     Furthermore, the prosecution highlighted the Court of Appeal’s decision of _Chong Sher Shen v PP (CA)_ (see above at \[10\]), where the accused had sought leave to appeal against the High Court’s dismissal of Criminal Revision 5 of 2019 brought by the accused. In particular, the accused sought the following orders:

> (a)     that the 1977 errors be removed from his CRO record;

> (b)     consequent upon (1), his conviction on 13 May 1998 by the then Subordinate Courts (now the State Courts) be set aside or alternatively, the two-year DQ which was ordered against him be substituted with a DQ of less than one year;

> (c)     the convictions entered against him by the then Subordinate Courts on 11 April 2001, 21 July 2005 and 4 June 2009, all of which pertained to traffic offences or related offences, be set aside…

In the Court of Appeal’s grounds of decision, the Court of Appeal observed that the two years’ disqualification imposed in 1998 was entirely justifiable based on the facts of that case.

25     The prosecution also submitted that specific deterrence must feature as the dominant sentencing consideration in this case, as the accused had demonstrated no remorse, and has continued to blame his misdeeds on other parties. The prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence would be an imprisonment term of not less than 12 months and a lifetime disqualification from driving.

26     The accused, in mitigation, submitted that he had erroneously thought that his 1998 disqualification was for three years, and therefore failed to obtain his licence right after that disqualification had expired. The accused again alleged that he had been framed for offences he did not commit in 1977, as can be seen by the subsequent discovery of the erroneous entry of the 1977 antecedents. The accused reiterated that he took issue with the expunging of the erroneous antecedent from his CRO, and I understood his main argument to be that the court ought to consider the possible compounding impact of the erroneous 1977 antecedents on the severity of the sentences and disqualification orders meted out for subsequent convictions.

## Decision on sentence

### Applicable principles

27     Section 67A(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act confers on the court the power to impose on repeat offenders a punishment in excess of the prescribed punishment for various traffic offences, including offences under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act. The court is empowered to impose a punishment not exceeding three times the prescribed punishment for the offence (subject to a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment) if satisfied, by reason of his previous convictions or his antecedents, that it is expedient for the protection of the public or with the view to the prevention of any further such offence.

28     In _PP v Lee Cheow Loong Charles_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 961</span>, the High Court observed that enhanced punishment for offences such as driving whilst under disqualification was targeted at deterring recalcitrant offenders, and cited the below from the speech of Prof S Jayakumar, Minister of Home Affairs, at the second reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 1992 (Bill 37 of 1992), proposing, _inter alia_, the increase in punishment for offences under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act:

> We are… concerned over a small group of incorrigible, habitual, high-risk drivers who show blatant disregard of the law and of the courts, despite repeated prosecutions and convictions. They are undeterred by punishments presently prescribed by the law. The amendments… are targeted only at this small group of recalcitrant offenders, specifically at those who repeatedly drive under disqualification or suspension, \[etc\]….

> … \[W\]e should be strict with such a repeat offender because, firstly, he has committed an offence which \[was\] sufficiently serious \[so\] that it was not compoundable and he had to appear and be prosecuted in the courts. Secondly, he was convicted and the court, apart from imposing any other sentence, also decided to impose a disqualification order on him. In short, the court was telling him that he should not be on the roads for whatever period the court decides. Thirdly, the offender blatantly ignores the court’s injunction against him and continues to drive on the roads. And fourthly, this repeat offender, after being sentenced for driving while under disqualification, commits the offence yet again, and in some cases, and again.

29     The principle of escalation, as articulated by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _PP v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 174</span> (“_Low Ji Qing_”), is also engaged as the accused may be considered a habitual offender who has re-offended. The aim of the assessment is to ascertain whether the accused is a “hardened offender”. Thus, in _Low Ji Qing_, the High Court cited with approval a passage from _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[43\] pertaining to offenders with relevant antecedents who carry out another offence, who would have:

> \[r\]epeatedly committed a pattern of offences without any sign or acknowledgment of contrition or remorse. The longer the period of time over which the offences have been committed, the more irrefutable it is that the offender manifests the quality of a habitual offender”.

30     The High Court in _Low Ji Qing_ at \[62\] emphasised that it was key to consider whether a cycle of offending exists, and if so, what has been the trend of offending behaviour. An escalation of sentences may be warranted where the offender’s antecedents exhibit a “cavalier disregard for the law”, or simply unwillingness to comply with the law. On the other hand, the principle of escalation recedes in significance if the antecedents are irrelevant, or where offending can be attributed to other factors such as mental disability, illness or frailty. In _Low Ji Qing_ at \[66\], the High Court further enunciated that the appropriateness of escalation requires a scrupulous assessment of the particular factual matrix, which is not a mechanical exercise. It is essential to assess whether the objective of preventing re-offending is _in fact met_ by the use of escalation, taking into account factors such as the pattern of offending, changes in the offender’s circumstances, and efforts made at reform in order to determine whether further escalation is warranted. Any decision must be premised on the court being satisfied that the offender can be deterred by imposing a graver punishment.

### Application to the facts

31     I first deal with the relevance of the erroneous entry of the 1977 antecedents, and the extent to which these entries affected the court’s assessment of the accused’s culpability. At the beginning of the analysis, it was essential to note that the 1977 antecedents were expunged from the accused’s CRO before the commencement of trial, as stated in _Chong Sher Shen v PP (CA)_ by the Court of Appeal:

> 6    Even if we treated this CM as an application under s 397 Criminal Procedure Code to refer questions of law of public interest, no such question was placed before us. If at all, the only possible question of law would have been: “Should an erroneous criminal record showing convictions that did not take place be expunged?”

> 7    The question called for a self-evident answer and had been answered affirmatively by the prosecution’s confirmation that the applicant’s CRO record **_was corrected even before the High Court heard CR 5._** On the above two legal grounds, which explained to the applicant, this CM should be dismissed.

> \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

32     The Court of Appeal explained at length the lack of merit of Criminal Revision 5 of 2019, which has been dismissed by the High Court, although it did not have to do so. The Court of Appeal stated in _Chong Sher Shen v PP (CA)_ at \[10\] – \[12\]:

> 10    The applicant argued that the District Court ordered DQ for two years “only and only because the Court took into consideration” the 1977 errors, in particular, the erroneous 1977 DQ for one year. He submitted that the District Court “should have imposed a disqualification for less than one year, in which case his disqualification would only be a suspension of his driving licence and not a revocation or cancellation of his licence altogether.” If that had happened, “his licence would be valid immediately after the expiry of the less than 1 year period of disqualification”. In other words, he would not be required to go through the process of applying for a driving licence again (with all the attendant tests). Flowing from this logic, the applicant added:

>> Following your petitioner’s submissions above, under a less than 1 year driving disqualification imposed for his 13th May 1998 conviction, for example, for 6 months, he would have had a valid driving licence after 12th March 1999 and following that he would have had a driving licence on each of the following dates of purported offences, that is, 29th September 2000, 30th November 2000, 1st November 2005, 22nd October 2007, 12th February 2008 and 1st February 2009.

> The applicant appeared to have made a computation error because 6 months after 13 May 1998 would not be 12 March 1999 but we left this aside and considered his arguments on their logic.

> 11     **_It was fair to say that the District Court could have taken the 1977 errors into consideration when it ordered DQ for two years in May 1998 but it was certainly not an inevitable consequence that the District Court would have ordered DQ for less than one year if the 1977 errors were not before the District Court_**. In fact, s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 1985 Rev Ed) (now s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed)), which applied to the second charge mentioned above, provides that a person guilty under s 3 “shall (unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification) be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) for period of 12 months from the date of the conviction”. The general rule therefore, was that a minimum DQ of 12 months would have been ordered, with or without the 1977 errors.

> 12    During mitigation on 13 May 1998, Mr Gurdaib Singh was recorded to have said the following:

>> Accused is 39 years old. Pleading guilty. On the day in question, regular driver not working. Principal Offender drove on an urgent assignment. Regrets the offences. Urges court for leniency. Ask that the disqualification be restricted to Class 4. Married with two children.

> It can be seen that the applicant’s counsel submitted on only the classes of driving licence for which the applicant should be disqualified, not on the length of the disqualification. No “special reasons” were highlighted to warrant DQ for less than 12 months. Further, as a director of the company, the applicant had allowed the public to be endangered by the presence of a large vehicle (the applicant says it was a 14-foot lorry) on the roads driven by someone not qualified to handle that sort of vehicle. **_The DQ for two years was therefore entirely justifiable on these facts alone._**

> \[emphasis in bold italics added\]

33     The Court of Appeal summarised the purport of the accused’s arguments as follows (in _Chong Sher Shen v PP (CA)_ at \[18\] – \[20\]):

> … the applicant’s logic flowing from \[10\] above is that there should have been a DQ of less than one year for the 1998 charges. If this were the case, his driving licence would still have been valid after the expiry of that DQ by late 1998 or early 1999 and his driving in 2000 would not have been an offence. Similarly, if there were no offence committed in 2000, then there would be no DQ for 5 years in 2001 and it follows that there would be no offence committed and therefore no DQ for seven years in 2005. Since there was no offence committed in 2005, there would also be no offence committed and no DQ of 14 years in 2009.

> 19    If the above was correct and all the convictions after 1998 were set aside, the applicant’s view was that for the \[current charges\], he committed no offence on 23 July 2015 when he was arrested for driving while under DQ and for not having third party insurance coverage and on 16 June 2017 when he drove a vehicle again.

> 20     **_It follows from the above that the foundation of the applicant’s claim of injustice done to him is that the 1998 DQ would definitely have been less than one year if the CRO containing the 1977 errors had not been used by the prosecution in court at the hearing in May 1998. According to the applicant’s logic, all the subsequent offences predicated upon the 1998 DQ for two years would not have taken place. However, as pointed out earlier and as we have explained in simple language to the applicant in court, the applicant’s premise regarding the 1998 DQ is totally wrong and unsupportable on facts and in law. It follows that his arguments built on and consequential upon this wrong premise cannot stand._**

> \[emphasis in bold italics added\]

34     For the reasons highlighted by the Court of Appeal, the erroneous entry of the 1977 antecedents in the accused’s CRO had no material bearing on the sentences to be imposed for the offences committed by the accused in the subsequent years.

35     In sentencing, I considered that the accused had chosen on more than one occasion to flout orders made by the court disqualifying him from driving. The accused may have thought that the 1998 disqualification of two years should have been shortened on a “wrong premise”, and it may have been possible that it had taken some years for this “wrong premise” to be apparent to the accused. Nevertheless, the court ought to take into account the accused’s culpability for acting deliberately in flouting a disqualification order that remained valid and had not been set aside by any court of law at the material time. The accused, despite knowing that he had been subject to disqualification orders on more than one occasion, had chosen deliberately and persistently to disregard these court orders.

36     In my view, it was essential to calibrate a sentence that would adequately meet the need for specific deterrence, as the accused, through his antecedents, has demonstrated disregard for the law and court orders. A longer period of imprisonment for the charges and a longer period of disqualification would send a clear signal to the accused that he should not attempt in the future to ignore court orders again. This was particularly so, given that it had been clearly impressed upon the accused in _Chong Sher Shen (CA)_ at \[21\] that the previous erroneous of 1977 entries in his CRO was no justification for unilaterally disregarding disqualification orders imposed by the court. It was also necessary, in the interests of general deterrence, to signal that the repeated disregard of disqualification orders meant for the protection of the public will be met with stiff punishment. While it was not necessary to impose a punishment in excess of the prescribed punishment for s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act under s 67A(1) of the Road Traffic Act, a sentence for the RTA Charge which was approximately double that of the heaviest sentence for his previous offence was proportionate and sufficient. Thus, the accused was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment and 30 years’ disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for the RTA Charge. The period of disqualification is to take effect from the date of his release from prisons.

37     As for the MVA Charge, similarly, it was appropriate to impose a punishment higher than the sentences imposed for his previous convictions. The acused was thus sentenced to two months’ imprisonment and 30 years’ disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for the MVA Charge. The period of disqualification to take effect from the date of conviction, pursuant to s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act.

38     Given that the RTA Charge and the MVA Charge pertained to one incident of driving the Van and the attendant risks posed by that act, I was of the view that it was appropriate to order the two imprisonment terms to run concurrently. Thus, the aggregate sentence was 10 months’ imprisonment and 30 years’ disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences.

## Conclusion

39     In the circumstances, the accused was convicted of the RTA Charge and the MVA Charge, and sentenced to an aggregate of 10 months’ imprisonment and 30 years’ disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences. The accused is presently on bail pending appeal.
