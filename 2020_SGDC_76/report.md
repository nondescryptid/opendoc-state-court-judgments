### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       A Yamaha motorcycle goes missing. And its owner makes a police report. Police cameras then identify the culprit, and she is arrested.[^1]

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to 2 charges:

> (a)     Committing theft of a motorcycle under s 379A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed),[^2] and

> (b)     Using a motorcycle without third-party motor insurance under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“**the Act**”).[^3]

3       The s 379A charge is the graver of the two charges, with imprisonment that may extend to 7 years and a mandatory driving disqualification. The severity of s 379A is underscored by the fact that before the Penal Code amendments in 2008, it had a mandatory minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment and a mandatory minimum driving disqualification of 3 years.

4       By way of background, it is unlawful to use a motor vehicle in Singapore without third-party motor insurance: s 3(1) of the Act. The Act’s primary object is to ensure compensation for the bodily injury or death of third parties arising from vehicular use on the road.[^4] Third-party motor insurance is of first importance. The gravity of s 3 of the Act is underlined by the mandatory imprisonment for such offences in England in the past: _Wilkinson’s Road Traffic Offences_ (Thomson Reuters, 28th Ed, 2017) at \[21-11\].

5       Under both s 3(1) of the Act and s 379A of the Penal Code, an offender would be disqualified from driving unless he shows “special reasons”.

6       This judgment is based on the following framework:

> (a)     What is the legislative intent of the statutory provisions? (see \[12\] to \[30\] below)

> (b)     What are the special reasons for not imposing a driving disqualification? (see \[32\] to \[43\] below)

> (c)     What are the sentencing considerations in the present case? (see \[44\] to \[98\] below)

7       All things considered, the Accused was jailed for 4 months, fined $500[^5] and disqualified from driving for 12 months.[^6]

8       In the final analysis, I found no special reason to dispense with the driving disqualification, which is mandatory as well as appropriate in the present case.[^7] The Statement of Facts can be found at **Annex A**. My grounds of decision are summarised below at \[99\].

9       No appeal has been lodged. I now set out my reasons.

## FRAMEWORK

10     This judgment can be crystallised under the following framework:

![](%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_Image/%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_image1.png)

11     We turn first to examining the legislative intent of the statutory provisions.

## A. Tracing the Formative Arc of s 379A of the Penal Code

## (i) Historical Background

12     Section 379A of the Penal Code used to have a mandatory minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment and a mandatory minimum driving disqualification of 3 years. This is reflected in the following graphs on the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (**SIR**) based on the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed):

![](%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_Image/%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_image2.png)

![](%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_Image/%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_image3.png)

13     However, both of these mandatory minimum sentences have been removed. At the second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, the Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, said \[_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (22 October 2007) vol. 83\]:

> In particular, we sought to reduce the number of offences carrying mandatory minimum punishment and the gap in imprisonment terms for double-limb penalties.

> _Review of mandatory minimum penalties_

> Sir, we will remove mandatory minimum imprisonment terms for four offences. These are sections 379A … In addition, we are removing the mandatory minimum disqualification for section 379A relating to theft of motor vehicle or component part.  (emphasis added)

## (ii) Policy behind s 379A

14     The prescribed punishment for s 379A of the Penal Code is imprisonment which may extend to 7 years and the offender shall also be liable to be fined. Both the imprisonment term and driving disqualification order are mandatory.

15     As s 379A entails mandatory disqualification, if an offender is convicted of several counts of that offence, the court has to impose a separate term of disqualification for each conviction: _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Rohaizad bin Rosni_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 180</span> at \[6\], \[10\] and \[11\].

16     The driving disqualification order takes effect from the date of the offender’s release from imprisonment: s 379A(2) of the Penal Code and _Public Prosecutor v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman and Another_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 136</span> at \[25\]-\[28\], which was affirmed in _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Rohaizad bin Rosni_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGHC 278</span> at \[12\]-\[15\].

17     This is in line with the legislative purpose of s 379A, which is to provide for heavier penalties against theft of motor vehicles: 44 Parliamentary Debates col 1862, 1869, 1878 (1984). The driving disqualification would have to run after the imprisonment period to ensure that the disqualification achieves maximum effect, _viz._ that the disqualification is not rendered ineffective because it ceases before the offender is released from imprisonment.[^8]

18     In this regard, the English cases on this issue are inapplicable as they are based on a completely different legislative intent: _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Rohaizad bin Rosni_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGHC 278</span> at \[15\].[^9]

19     Based on the wording of s 379A(2) and Parliament’s intention when enacting this section, multiple disqualification terms imposed could only be concurrent.[^10] This is because each period of disqualification, regardless of the number and duration of these periods, had to start from the date of the offender’s _release_ from imprisonment.[^11]

20     Next, I turn to examine the legislative intent of s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act.

## B. Legislative Intent behind Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act

## (i) Preamble

21     The Act’s preamble states that it was enacted to “provide against third-party risks arising out of the use of motor vehicles and for the payment of compensation in respect of death or bodily injury arising out of the use of motor vehicles and for matters incidental thereto”.

## (ii) Historical Background

22     At the second reading of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Bill, the Minister for Labour and Law, Mr K.M. Byrne, said \[_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (13 January 1960) vol. 12 at col 16\]:

> This Bill re-enacts the provisions of Part II of the Road Traffic Ordinance …

23     By way of historical background, Part II of the Road Traffic Ordinance contained the provisions found in Part II of the Road Traffic Ordinance of the Straits Settlements 1941 (“1941 Ordinance”). Part II of the 1941 Ordinance dealt with compulsory third-party liability insurance connected with the use of motor vehicles. The 1941 Ordinance repealed the Straits Settlements Road Traffic (Third-Party Insurance) Ordinance 1938 and reproduced the provisions of the 1938 Ordinance in Part II of the 1941 Ordinance. It was the 1938 Ordinance which first introduced the principle of compulsory third-party insurance to the Straits Settlements, based on the United Kingdom model.[^12]

## (iii) Policy behind Section 3

24     Having briefly outlined the Act’s genesis, what is the policy behind the interpretation of section 3 of the Act?

25     At its core, section 3 seeks to achieve the dual aims of ensuring that victims of traffic accidents are not left without any compensation, and also to deter irresponsible motorists from driving without the appropriate insurance coverage: _Er Kee Jeng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 485</span> at \[39\]. Bringing this to sharper focus is the fact that Parliament has deemed it fit to make the offence one of strict liability with only a limited defence in section 3(4):[^13]_Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span> (“_Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim”)_ at \[39\].

26     The Act’s _raison d'etre_ is to protect third-party road users, not the insured driver: _Public Prosecutor v Lee Hong Hwee_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR(R) 39</span> at \[31\]. In other words, s 3(1) seeks to ensure that compensation would be available to persons involved in accidents on the road. For that reason, contravening s 3(1) is a serious offence: _Stewart Ashley James v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 106</span> at \[17\].

27     The gravity of the offence finds expression in the mandatory 12-month disqualification order and a possible custodial sentence that avail the judge in sentencing the offender: _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim_ at \[40\].

28     I pause to observe that the severity of section 3 of the Act is underscored by the mandatory imprisonment for such offences in England in the past: _Wilkinson’s Road Traffic Offences_[^14] (Thomson Reuters, 28th Ed, 2017) at \[21-11\]:

> “Prior to 1965, disqualification or, at one time, imprisonment was obligatory for using a motor vehicle without insurance, or causing or permitting such use” (emphasis added).

29     Deterrence is the policy underpinning the mandatory 12-month disqualification order: _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim_ at \[40\]. This is because a 12-month disqualification order would mean that for the entire year in which the order is in effect, the offender is reminded every day of his offence and the unwarranted risks in which he had placed ordinary members of the public: _Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 265</span> at \[28\]. As stated in _Public Prosecutor v Mohd Isa_ <span class="citation">\[1963\] MLJ 135</span>, the “most satisfactory penalty for most motoring offences is disqualification” because a fine is paid once and then forgotten.[^15]

30     In sum, it would be repugnant to the Act’s legislative intention if motorists do not face the criminal consequences of driving without appropriate insurance coverage: _Saimonn Teo Rong Zhi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 185</span> at \[27\].

31     I turn now to the law on special reasons with regard to imposing a disqualification order.

## C. Special Reasons for Driving Disqualification: Two-Stage Framework

32     Under both s 3(1) of the Act and s 379A of the Penal Code, an offender would be disqualified from driving unless he shows “special reasons”.

33     In this connection, the two-stage framework for “special reasons” is as follows:

> (a)      First Stage: Show special reasons, _viz._ reasons relating to the facts or circumstances of an _offence_ and not to the offender herself; and

> (b)      Second Stage: Even if special reasons are established, the court will consider whether the discretion not to disqualify must be exercised in favour of the offender.

34     Under the two-stage framework, the first stage is offence-specific (not offender-specific). When an offender seeks to come within the special reasons exception, the facts to back up such circumstances must be proved to the court’s satisfaction.[^16] Even if special reasons are established, it does not automatically follow that the offender would not be disqualified from driving. For the second stage, the court’s discretion not to disqualify can only be made in very exceptional circumstances.[^17]

## (i) First Stage

35     What are “special reasons” not to impose a driving disqualification? The special reasons have to be reasons relating to the facts or circumstances of an offence and not to the offender himself – this would be the clearest means of giving effect to Parliament’s intention: _M V Balakrishnan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 846</span> at \[9\], and _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span> at \[41\].

36     In other words, a special reason is a mitigating or extenuating circumstance, not amounting in law to a defence to the charge, yet directly connected with the commission of the offence, and one which the court ought properly to take into consideration when imposing punishment: _Whittall v Kirby_ <span class="citation">\[1947\] 1 KB 194</span> at 201, as endorsed by _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim_ at \[30\].

37     Offender-specific factors, such as the fact that the defendant is of a good character or has a good driving record, cannot be accepted as special reasons: _Wilkinson’s Road Traffic Offences_, Sweet & Maxwell, (28th Ed, 2017, General Editor: Kevin McCormac) at \[21-10\]. Circumstances peculiar to the offender do not go towards reducing his moral culpability; they are essentially extrinsic facts about the offender which are unrelated to the offence but are produced to elicit sympathy from the court. These circumstances are morally distinguishable from circumstances peculiar to the offence: _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim_ at \[43\].

38     Even if an offender requires his driving licence for his livelihood, this would not constitute a special reason.[^18] This is because in the Malaysian Criminal Appeal Court case of _Public Prosecutor v Hiew Chin Fong_ <span class="citation">\[1988\] 1 MLJ 467</span>[^19] – which was endorsed in _Chua Chye Tiong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR(R) 22</span> at \[61\] and \[62\] – a 12-month disqualification period was imposed on the offender despite the fact that his livelihood depended on him having a driving licence.

39     The Criminal Appeal Court in _Public Prosecutor v Hiew Chin Fong_ laid down several statements of law on what should _not_ be considered special reasons:

> (a)     Financial hardship to the offender;

> (b)     The offender knew no other means of earning his livelihood;

> (c)     That the effect of the disqualification must necessarily and consequently deprive the offender of his livelihood or occupation; and

> (d)     That the offender was a poor man and would have difficulty to get to his work.

40     Before an emergency is capable of amounting to a special reason under law, a crucial prerequisite is for the offender to show that there was no alternative but for him to drive, and that he had explored every reasonable alternative before driving: _Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 265</span> at \[17\].

41     When an offender seeks to come within the special reasons exception, the facts to back up such circumstances must be proved to the court’s satisfaction: _Toh Yong Soon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 147</span> at \[5\]. The onus lies on an accused to raise special reasons for the court’s consideration, if such reasons exist: _Chue Woon Wai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 725</span> at \[13\].[^20]

## (ii) Second Stage

42     Even if special reasons are established, it does not automatically follow that the offender would not be disqualified. In this regard, there must be a separate process of considering whether the discretion must be exercised in favour of the offender: _Sivakumar s/o Rajoo_ at \[22\]. The limited discretion not to disqualify can only be made in very exceptional circumstances, having regard to the special circumstances as well as to the whole of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, including the manner in which the offender drove[^21] and the alcohol content in the offender’s body: _Sivakumar s/o Rajoo_ at \[25\].

43     Pulling the various strands together, the test for special reasons is stringent and is only satisfied in very exceptional circumstances.[^22] The Act is construed strictly in order to preserve its policy of protecting road users: _Chua Chye Tiong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR (R) 22</span> at \[53\]. A less restrictive approach would negate the legislative stipulation of mandatory disqualification and defeat its underlying objectives: _Siti Hajar bte Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 248</span> at \[8\]. Widening the special reasons exception would encourage frivolous defences: _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim_ at \[41\].

> (See also Tan Yock Lin and S. Chandra Mohan, _Criminal Procedure_ (LexisNexis: March 2019; Binder 3, Loose-leaf, Chapter XVII: Sentencing) at \[3702\], \[3751\] and \[3752\])

## D. Sentencing Considerations in the Present Case

## (i) Sentencing Information and Research Repository (SIR)

44     The prescribed punishment for s 379A of the Penal Code is an imprisonment term which may extend to 7 years and the offender shall also be liable to be fined. For s 379A, both the imprisonment term and driving disqualification order are mandatory. General deterrence would be a relevant consideration. The SIR for the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) provides as follows:

![](%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_Image/%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_image4.png)

![](%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_Image/%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_image5.png)

45     I am mindful that the above graphs reflect the fact that before the Penal Code amendments in 2008, s 379A had a mandatory minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment and a mandatory minimum driving disqualification of 3 years.

46     The prescribed punishment for s 3 of the Act is a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both.[^23] A person convicted of an offence under this section shall, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the court’s power to order a longer disqualification period, be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for 12 months from the conviction date.[^24]

47     Therefore, an offender under s 3 of the Act is subject to separate components of punishment – a fine and/or imprisonment _and_ the mandatory disqualification of at least 12 months unless special reasons are provided. Increasing the quantum of the fine imposed or even imposing a custodial sentence should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced disqualification period than would otherwise have been ordered. The SIR for s 3 of the Act provides as follows for driving disqualification:

![](%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_Image/%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_image6.png)

## (ii) Objectives for Driving Disqualification Orders

48     Driving disqualification orders meld the three sentencing objectives of punishment, protection of the public and deterrence: _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> at \[13\]-\[14\] and _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span> at \[64\].

49     The most important sentencing principles engaged in driving disqualification orders are (a) the protection of society, because the objective of disqualification orders is to prevent future harm that the offender may cause to the public, and (b) deterrence, because such orders deprive offenders of the freedom to drive: _Public Prosecutor v Ong Heng Chua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 95</span> at \[61\].

50     As stated in _Public Prosecutor v Mohd Isa_ <span class="citation">\[1963\] MLJ 135</span>, the “most satisfactory penalty for most motoring offences is disqualification” because a fine is paid once and then forgotten.[^25] A 12-month disqualification order would mean that for the entire year in which the order is in effect, the offender is reminded every day of his offence and the unwarranted risks in which he had placed ordinary members of the public: _Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 265</span> at \[28\].

51     Where a person is disqualified for a period of 12 months or longer, that person’s driving licence shall be “of no effect” and the person is further prevented from driving a motor vehicle after the disqualification period unless he passes the prescribed test of competence to drive: s 43(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).

52     In _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 194</span> at \[13\], the High Court stated that due to the limited range of fines from $1,000 to $5,000 for a first-time offender, the mandatory driving disqualification order was in fact the principal punitive element of an offence under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act, and the impact of a driving disqualification order was likely to be felt much more acutely than any marginal increase in the quantum of the fine.[^26]

53     It stands to reason that the High Court’s views in _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen_ apply with greater force to the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act as the maximum fine for an offence under s 3 of the Act is $1000.[^27]

54     An offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought therefore to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament.[^28] Put another way, the court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence.[^29]

## (iii) Interplay of Harm, Culpability, and Mitigating/ Aggravating Factors

55     At its heart, the interplay of

> (a)     Harm,

> (b)     Culpability, and

> (c)     Mitigating/ Aggravating factors (“**Analytical Framework**”) lends itself well to sentencing.

56     Harm is a measure of the injury that has been caused to society by the commission of the offence.[^30] Harm may:

> (a)     Cleave into “physical harm” and “psychological harm” for maid abuse cases under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code: _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 42</span> at \[70\]-\[72\]; and

> (b)     Include serious economic loss to the victim under s 17(1) of the Medical Registration Act: _Neo Ah Luan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 188</span> at \[69\].

57     As an aside, the nature of harm (i.e. whether the harm is physical or intangible) is considered by Singapore’s Model Artificial Intelligence Governance Framework (Second Edition, 21 January 2020),[^31] which also harnesses a severity/ probability of harm matrix.

58     Culpability is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act.[^32]

59     The Analytical Framework for offences under s 3(1) of the Act and s 379A of the Penal Code may be curated as follows:

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated](%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_Image/%5B2020%5D%20SGDC%200076_image7.png)

60     Two observations can be made in relation to the Analytical Framework:

> (a)     The synergistic interplay between harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing.

> (b)     The eclectic ensemble of cases adopting the Analytical Framework is testament to its versatility.

61     First, the synergistic interplay of harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing. While facts are the cornerstone, harm and culpability are the pillars on which we place the cross-beams of aggravating and mitigating factors.

62     The typical framework consists of a 2-step sentencing bands framework as found in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span> at \[73(a), (c) and (d)\].[^33]

63     At the first step, the court should have regard to the _offence-specific_ factors in deciding which band the offence in question falls under. Offence-specific factors comprise factors going towards: (a) the harm caused by the offence; and (b) the offender’s culpability.[^34]

64     These categories may not always be watertight.[^35] For instance, the degree of planning and premeditation and the level of sophistication, were categorised as offence-specific factors going towards the offender’s _culpability_ in _Logachev Vladislav_. Yet, the High Court observed that they may also relate to the _harm_ caused by the offence in so far as they affect the likelihood of harm: _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> at \[38\].

65     Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may usually be imposed for an offence with those features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an “indicative starting point”.

66     At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender to calibrate the sentence. These _offender-specific_ factors comprise other aggravating and mitigating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence.[^36]

67     I pause here to note that a slight variant of the 2-step sentencing bands framework finds expression in drug trafficking and importation cases where the quantity of the drugs indicates the potential harm to society.  In this regard, the indicative starting sentence – based on the quantity of the drugs (_viz._ potential harm) – may be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors.  Essentially, _harm_ is the fulcrum for such cases.

68     Examples of these cases include _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 197</span> at \[43\]-\[48\] (drug trafficking)[^37] and _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 25</span> at \[29\]-\[30\] (drug importation).[^38]

69     In similar vein, for voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code, the seriousness of the injury caused (_viz._ harm) is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and guides the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing. The indicative starting sentence may then be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and other aggravating and mitigating factors: _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> at \[55\].[^39] 

70     Another model of the 2-step sentencing bands framework can be found in fatal accident cases under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code. For such cases, as the harm is the death of the victim, the harm is generally uniform. Accordingly, what sets such cases apart is, in the vast majority of cases, determined primarily by the accused’s _culpability_.[^40]  After considering the accused’s culpability, a sentencing court takes into account other aggravating and mitigating factors: _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> at \[54\]. 

71     Finally, in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> at \[52\], \[57\] and \[60\],[^41] the 3-Judge Panel noted that the:

> “offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors are necessarily factored into the analysis within the harm and culpability considerations themselves”.

72     An example of this approach may be found in _Public Prosecutor v Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 178</span> at \[50\]-\[56\], where the 3-Judge Panel held that exceptional performance during National Service was not a _mitigating_ factor, as it reduces neither the defaulter’s _culpability_ nor the _harm_ he had caused by his offence.

73     For completeness, instead of using the 2-step sentencing bands framework as a starting point for sentencing, the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chai Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 272</span>[^42] stated that the starting inquiry in sentencing offenders with a mental disorder ought to be whether the deterrent, retributive and protective principles of sentencing prevail over the principle of rehabilitation.

> (See also Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (6th Edition, 2015, Cambridge University Press) at \[4.3\] and \[4.5\])

## APPROPRIATE SENTENCE

77      **Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions** **.** The Prosecution sought the following sentences:

> (a)     For s 3(1) of the Act:[^56] a fine of $600 and 12-month driving disqualification, and

> (b)     For s 379A of the Penal Code:[^57] a custodial sentence of 4 to 6 months and 12-month driving disqualification.

78     For its sentencing position of 4 to 6 months’ jail for s 379A of the Penal Code, the Prosecution cited _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nur Bin Abdullah_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 232</span> at \[22\]. The Prosecution also highlighted the premeditation on the Accused’s part to steal a motorcycle.

79      **Mitigation Plea** **.** The Accused sought a lenient sentence. As a widow whose husband has just passed away, she has to take care of 5 children.

## (i) Harm/ Culpability

80      **Harm/ Culpability**. I agree with the Prosecution that there was premeditation on the Accused’s part to steal a motorcycle. The Statement of Facts states at \[6\] that the Accused had borrowed spare keys from her boyfriend as she intended to steal a motorcycle at the nearby carpark. She then stole a white and green coloured ‘Yamaha Spark 135’ motorcycle valued at about S$8000.[^58]

81     The Accused also called her boyfriend and sought his assistance to start the motorcycle; they were not successful and eventually abandoned the motorcycle.[^59] In this regard, one of the factors affecting sentence for s 379A of the Penal Code is “group action”: _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (3rd Edition: Vol I) at page 673.

82     Drawing a parallel with the High Court’s views on the term “group assault” in _Arumugam Selvaraj v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 199</span> at \[14\],[^60] I am aware that there must be consideration of whether there was indeed “group action”. Paraphrasing _Arumugam Selvaraj_ at \[14\], actions taken by two people are on the very edges of the meaning of “group action”. It is important to unbundle the meaning and objective of the term “group action”, and to ensure that consideration is given to the fact that the situation is perhaps different from actions by a larger number, as it would be as regards a solo effort.[^61] It is in between, and I was of the view that the sentencing should be undertaken with that in mind.[^62]

83     In this connection, I am mindful that the Accused had tried to kick start the motorcycle on her own a few times, and it was only when her efforts were unsuccessful that she called her boyfriend and sought his assistance to help her start the motorcycle.[^63]

84     This motorcycle was recovered without damage, there was no professional operation, and no special equipment or instrument was used to facilitate the theft of the motorcycle. However, these were neutral factors since the mere absence of an aggravating factor is a neutral factor for sentencing.[^64]

## (ii) Mitigating/ Aggravating Factors

85      **Personal Circumstances** **.** The Accused intimated that being the sole bread-winner, her incarceration would bring hardship to her family. However, personal circumstances such as financial difficulties and hardship caused to family by an offender’s incarceration have no mitigating value save in the most exceptional cases.[^65] In the present case, I saw no cogent reasons to consider her personal financial and family circumstances as valid mitigating factors.[^66]

86      **Clean Record**. I gave due weight to the Accused’s clean record.

87      **Plea of Guilt**. I gave due weight to the Accused’s plea of guilt.[^67] That said, given the police cameras’ video footage,[^68] the evidence against the Accused was overwhelming[^69] and lends itself to the conclusion that she had little choice but to plead guilty.[^70]

## (iii) Special Reasons

88      **Special Reasons**. The Accused did not submit on any special reasons to reduce or not impose the driving disqualification. The onus lies on her to raise special reasons for the court’s consideration, if such reasons exist: _Chue Woon Wai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 725</span> at \[13\].[^71]

89     Notwithstanding this, I considered whether there were any circumstances peculiar to the offence which would amount to special reasons. In my judgment, there were none.[^72]

90     For completeness, the $500 fine under s 3 of the Act cannot be deemed to be manifestly excessive. It was nowhere near the maximum prescribed fines. A custodial term was not imposed for s 3 of the Act.

91      **Sentence** **.** Where do the scales of justice lie in the present case? All things considered, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" colsep="1" frame="all" rowsep="1"><colgroup><col width="31%"> <col width="38%"> <col width="31%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>MAC/ DAC NO.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>SENTENCE</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>DQ</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 901456 of 2020</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">[s 3(1) Cap 189]</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $500 i/d 2 days’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 months with effect from date of conviction</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 901359 of 2020</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">[s 379A Cap 224]</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment for 4 months</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 months with effect from date of release from prison</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence: Imprisonment for 4 months, fine of $500 in default 2 days’ imprisonment, and 12-month driving disqualification for all classes</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

## Totality Principle for Driving Disqualification Orders

92     In my judgment, the Totality principle is engaged for driving disqualification orders, subject to any mandatory minimum driving disqualification periods as stipulated by the statutory provisions.

93     The Totality principle would have a lesser impact on driving disqualification orders vis-à-vis other types of punishment (imprisonment, fines and caning) because driving disqualification orders do not run consecutively. That said, when an accused person is charged with different types of driving offences and driving disqualification orders are meted out – as was done in the present case – these disqualification orders may, depending on the statutory provisions in question, start from the date of a person’s conviction or where the person is sentenced to imprisonment, on the date of the person’s release from prison.[^73]

94     I hewed to the principles in _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span>, and considered both limbs of the Totality principle:[^74]

> (a)     First Limb: Whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the _normal_ level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. This calls for a comparison between the total sentence on the one hand and a yardstick on the other hand.

> (If it is not possible to determine the “_normal_ level of sentences”, the midpoint of the maximum prescribed sentence might be a useful proxy: _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 221</span> at \[94\])

> (b)     Second limb: Whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects: _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> at \[54\]-\[57\].

> (A “crushing sentence” is one that destroys any hope of recovery and reintegration of the offender: _Public Prosecutor v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 69</span> at \[67\])[^75]

95     At this juncture, I pause to note that far from being a monochrome, the Totality principle has a many-splendoured piquancy. Three examples would suffice. First, in _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> at \[18\]-\[23\], the High Court stated that as a matter of logic, the Totality principle is equally capable of having a _boosting effect_ on individual sentences where they would otherwise result in a manifestly inadequate overall sentence.[^76] This is because the Totality principle requires not only that the overall sentence not be excessive but also that it not be inadequate.[^77]

96     Second, the Totality principle applies to a cumulative sentence of _caning_ imposed for several distinct offences.[^78] Where there are multiple convictions for similar offences, a court is entitled to vary the number of strokes to be imposed for each charge on account of the Totality principle: _Ho Sheng Yu Garreth v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 375</span> at \[133\]. This would, of course, be subject to the mandatory minimum number of strokes as stipulated by the statutory provisions. Conversely, the aggregate sentence of caning cannot exceed the specified limit of 24 strokes: s 328(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). This specified limit acts as a statutory breakwater with regard to the aggregate sentence of caning.

97     Third, the Totality principle also applies to _multiple fines_, where the totality principle may allow for the adjustment of individual fines so that the cumulative fine is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality. This, however, would be subject to any contrary statutory provisions having mandatory force: _Seng Foo Building Construction Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 243</span> at \[4\], \[63\], \[72\], and \[80\].[^79] With regard to multiple fines, the sentencing court needs to also calibrate carefully the in-default imprisonment terms. This is because the Totality principle may be infringed if the sentencing court overlooks the fact that in-default imprisonment terms runs consecutively.

98     I also kept in mind the proportionality principle in sentencing.[^80]

## CONCLUSION

## Summary

99     A summary of my Grounds of Decision is as follows:

> (a)     The Analytical Framework – _viz_. interplay of harm, culpability and mitigating/ aggravating factors – applies to the offences in the present case (at \[55\] to \[76\]).

> (b)     There was premeditation on the Accused’s part to steal a motorcycle (at \[80\]).

> (c)     There were no cogent reasons to consider the Accused’s personal financial and family circumstances as valid mitigating factors (at \[85\]).

> (d)     Due weight was given to her plea of guilt and clean record (at \[86\] to \[87\]).

> (e)     There was no special reason to dispense with the driving disqualification (at \[32\] to \[43\] and \[88\] to \[89\]).

> (f)     The driving disqualification orders hewed to the Totality principle as laid out in _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam_ (at \[92\] to \[97\]).

100    All things considered, the Accused was jailed for 4 months, fined $500 in default 2 days’ imprisonment, and disqualified from driving for 12 months.

101    In the final analysis, I found no special reason to dispense with the driving disqualification, which is mandatory as well as appropriate in the present case.[^81]

102    No appeal has been lodged. The Accused is currently serving her sentence.[^82]

## Annex A: Statement of Facts

**PUBLIC PROSECUTOR V ROZILAWATY BINTE EDDY ROSMANAH**

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

## Introduction

1.     The accused is Rozilawaty binte Eddy Rosmanah, a 38-year-old female Singaporean. The accused was unemployed at the material time of offences, and was residing together with her boyfriend at the latter’s residence at Blk 117A Canberra Crescent #XXX Singapore.

2.     The complainant-victim is one Muhammad Zulhilmi Bin Yazid, a 29-year-old male. The complainant is the owner of a motorcycle bearing the registration plate no. FBC5475R. The said motorcycle is a white and green coloured “Yamaha Spark 135” model, valued at about S$8,000.

## First Information Report

3.     On 19 January 2020 at about 10.01 am, the complainant made a ‘999’ call to the police, reporting, “My bike stolen. I park Friday night now I see don’t have. Key with me. Checked everywhere don’t have. No outstanding payments FBC5475R Yamaha Spark 135. Need police.”

## Facts pertaining to the 1st charge (DAC-901359-2020) – s 379A Penal Code

4.     Investigations revealed that on 17 January 2020 at about 6.30 pm, the complainant parked his motorcycle at an unknown lot near staircase 2 at Deck 2B of the multistorey carpark located at Blk 117 Canberra Crescent, Singapore (the “Carpark”). The complainant locked the handlebar of his motorcycle before heading home with his keys.

5.     On 19 January 2020 at about 9.30 am, the complainant returned to the Carpark to retrieve his motorcycle, but found that it was missing. He thus lodged the police report reproduced at paragraph \[3\] above.

6.     Further investigations revealed that the accused had requested for a bunch of spare keys from her boyfriend in the morning of 19 January 2020. The accused had asked for these spare keys intending to try and use them to unlock and steal a motorcycle at the nearby Carpark for the purpose of taking a joyride. The accused’s boyfriend then gave her the bunch of keys, and the accused left the apartment for the Carpark with these keys to look for a motorcycle to steal.

7.     The accused arrived at the Carpark and saw the complainant’s motorcycle parked in the lot. She also saw the complainant’s helmet left unsecured in the basket of his motorcycle, and put it on. She then inserted one of the keys that she had brought along with her into the ignition of the complainant’s motorcycle, and attempted to turn on the engine. The start light indicator however did not switch on, and the accused thus used her legs to push the complainant’s motorcycle out of the Carpark while sitting on it.

8.     After pushing the complainant’s motorcycle out of the Carpark in this manner, the accused again tried to kick start the motorcycle a few times, but to no avail. The accused thus called her boyfriend and sought his assistance to help her start the motorcycle.

9.     The accused’s boyfriend subsequently arrived and tried to help the accused kick start the motorcycle, but was similarly unsuccessful. He then attempted to start the motorcycle while riding it on free gear, but again this did not work. The accused and her boyfriend eventually gave up trying to start the complainant’s motorcycle after about 10 minutes, and abandoned the motorcycle in front of a rubbish chute at Blk 118 Canberra Crescent. The accused also took off the complainant’s helmet that she was wearing and threw it on the grass verge behind the said block.

10.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had, intending to take dishonestly the said motorcycle out of the complainant’s possession without his consent, moved the said motorcycle out of the unknown lot at the Carpark. She has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 379A of the Penal Code.

11.    The complainant’s motorcycle was subsequently recovered and returned to the complainant. Police cameras (POLCAM) installed in the vicinity identified the accused and her boyfriend in connection with the theft, and the pair were arrested at the latter’s home on 20 January 2020.

## Facts pertaining to the 3rd charge (MAC-901456-2020) – s 3(1) p/u s 3(2) MVA

12.    By using her legs to push the complainant’s motorcycle out of the Carpark and to Blk 118 Canberra Crescent, the accused had used the said motorcycle on the road.

13.    At the material time, there was no policy of insurance or security in respect of third party risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“MVA”) in relation to the accused’s use of the complainant’s motorcycle. The accused has thereby committed an offence under s 3(1) and punishable under s 3(2) of the MVA.

## Conclusion

14.    The accused admits to the above two offences and stands charged accordingly.

[^34]: Judge-made sentencing frameworks for a variety of statutory offences take the common form of a harm-culpability matrix which embeds in a fundamental way retributive thinking in the sentencing exercise: _Public Prosecutor v ASR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 16</span> at \[131\].

[^35]: The factors relating to harm and culpability often affect both considerations: _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> at \[79\]. A sentencing court should be mindful not to double count the offence-specific factors in its sentencing assessment: _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 221</span> at \[58\].

[^40]: “\[T\]here will be exceptional cases where the _harm_ caused by the offence can also be used to determine both the applicable category and where the particular case falls within the applicable presumptive sentencing range. One example of this would be where more than one death is caused, as in the present case”: _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> at \[56\].

[^41]: This case dealt with the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant (police officers and public servants who are performing duties akin to police duties at the material time) under s 332 of the Penal Code.

[^42]: The offender had caused a fatal accident by a rash act under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code.

[^43]: The two principal parameters which a sentencing court would generally have regard to in evaluating the seriousness of a crime are: (a) the harm caused by the offence, and (b) the offender’s culpability. _Lim Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span> at \[28\], _Public Prosecutor v Tan Thian Earn_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 269</span> at \[19\], _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span> at \[41\], and _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> at \[33\] and \[53\]-\[56\].
