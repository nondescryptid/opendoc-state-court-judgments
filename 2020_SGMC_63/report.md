### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       The two accused persons were husband and wife. The accused Farha and her husband Tasleem faced charges of voluntary causing hurt under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code, Cap 224 (“PC”), to their domestic helper Amandeep Kaur (“the victim”) between November to December 2016. Farha faced 10 charges, and Tasleem faced two charges. All the offences were committed in their flat at Block 157D, Rivervale Crescent, #XXX, Singapore 544157.

2       They claimed trial to all the charges. At the end of the trial, I found them guilty on all the charges and I convicted them accordingly. Farha was sentenced to a global sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment. I ordered her to pay $4,500/- as compensation to the victim. Tasleem was sentenced to a global sentence of four months’ imprisonment. I ordered him to pay $1,000/- as compensation to the victim.

## The charges

## The trial

### The undisputed facts

5       The following facts were not disputed in the trial –

> (a)     The victim was the accused persons’ domestic maid from 9 Nov 16 to 31 Dec 16.

> (b)     The employment contract[^1] signed by the victim stipulated that she would work for the accused persons for two years. She would also receive her monthly salary of $400/- from the third month onwards ie, from January 2017.

> (c)     The accused persons’ household comprised them and their two sons, namely, Ashaz (who was six years old at the relevant time), and Ashir (who was two years old at the relevant time).

> (d)     The victim was referred to work for the accused persons through her cousin, Neelam, who was an agent[^2].

> (e)     On 31 Dec 16, the victim was spotted by a Bangladeshi worker, Mani Manoharan (“Mani”) sitting on the ledge on the exterior side of the living room of the flat. Mani had brought her down to the foot of the flat using a gondola which was used for painting works. On the same day, at about 12.44 pm, a first information report was lodged. The contents of the report were as follow, “_earlier on, there was a maid sitting on the ledge of level 4. We have brought her down. Please faster send police now_” [^3].

> (f)     Subsequently, the victim was placed in the care of the Good Shepherd Centre at Yishun pending the conclusion of the case.

### The prosecution’s case

6       As the accused persons’ domestic helper, the victim was tasked with the following chores, namely, general cleaning of the flat, cooking, washing and ironing of the family’s clothes, picking up Ashaz from school and bathing and feeding him, massaging both Ashaz and Ashir, and keeping an eye for them[^4]. Her routine was as follows – on weekdays, she would wake up at 5.00 am, and only sleeps at 2.30 am to 3.00 am the next day. On weekends, she would wake up later at 7.30 am[^5]. The victim testified that she was able to cope with the tasks assigned to her.

7       The accused Farha was a fulltime housewife. She was almost always at home. Her husband, Tasleem, was working fulltime. Every day, he left the house at 7.00 am and only returned home at 7.00 pm. He did not work on weekends[^6].

8       The victim testified that from the outset Farha had treated her badly. She was subjected to reprimands and beatings by Farha. When the victim asked her why she was treated in this manner, Farha had replied “_because I’m the one who called for you to come here. I can do whatever I wish onto you_” [^7].

9       On the contrary, her relationship with Tasleem was initially good. Because of this, the victim testified that she had told him about her problems with Farha and her abuses. However, she said over time their relationship turned bad because “_Sir was nice and thereafter because Madam may have been speaking or giving feedback to Sir_”. She also testified that Farha had also accused her of possibly having an affair with Tasleem[^8].

10     The victim alleged that Farha had assaulted her on 10 occasions, and Tasleem on two occasions.

#### Farha - the 1st charge (MAC 900957/18)

11     This was the first assault. It happened on 9 Nov 16, the victim’s first day of work. On that day, the victim was assaulted twice by Farha. The victim testified that she did not know the reason why as Farha had not said anything to her[^9].

12     The first incident occurred while she was making chapati, a type of flat bread. She recalled that it happened sometime in the morning. She was standing in front of the hob in the kitchen making the chapati. Farha had slapped her on her left cheek with her right arm. Farha was then standing about an elbow’s length on her right. The slap caused the victim to feel pain and she cried[^10].

13     Subsequently, in the afternoon, she was cleaning the kitchen and standing near the window when she was punched on her right eye by Farha. She testified that the punch was quite hard[^11].

#### Farha – the 2nd charge (MAC 900958/18)

14     This incident happened sometime in November 2016[^12]. She was making chapatis for breakfast at the time at the kitchen countertop. She testified that Farha had grabbed the rolling pin and had hit her on the back once with it. She said that the rolling pin had hit her on the left shoulder area of her back. She felt pain. She said Farha did not say anything at the time.

#### Farha - the 9th and 10th charges (MAC 900965-6/18)

15     The next two incidents of assault happened sometime between 13 and 14 Nov 16, and 24 Dec 16. On both occasions, she had been assaulted by Farha with a pair of tongs that was used to cook chapati.

16     The victim remembered that the first incident happened sometime in the afternoon of 14 Nov 16, because it was also the date of her cousin’s wedding. Her mother had told her about it when she had called home three days before. That afternoon, the victim was making chapati at the gas stove in the kitchen. After she had moulded and flattened the dough, she had placed it on a hot plate to heat it. After that, she used the pair of tongs to take the cooked chapati off the hot plate and placed the chapati over the naked flame emanating from the hob. Farha had seen what she had done and she commented that she was not doing it properly. Farha had picked up the tongs, which was by then placed on the side on the kitchen counter-top and hit the victim on her left forearm once with it[^13].

17     The victim testified that the second incident of assault with the tongs happened on 24 Dec 16. She said the assault happened under similar circumstances as the first assault ie, while she was making chapati. She said that she had used the tongs to flip the chapati, and placed it on the counter-top, when Farha had entered the kitchen angrily, took the tongs which the victim had placed on the counter-top, and touched her right arm with the sharp edge of the tongs. This time, the tongs were hot to the touch. She said she had felt scalded[^14]. She pointed to a linear scar on her right arm[^15] as the location where the tongs had touched her.

#### Farha - the 3rd charge (MAC 900959/18)

18     This incident happened in the bathroom in the master bedroom in the evening of 26 Dec 16[^16]. The victim was giving the two sons their bath. As the two children were playful during their bath, Farha had entered the bathroom and scolded the victim for not managing her sons well and for not bathing them properly. Farha then took the shower head[^17] and hit the victim’s left upper arm two or three times with it. The assault caused the victim pain and she cried. She pointed to a scatter of bruises on her upper left arm[^18] as those that were caused by the assault.

#### Farha - the 4th charge (MAC 900960/18)

19     This incident happened on 29 Dec 16 in the living room[^19]. The victim was sweeping the floor with a broom[^20] at the time. She had asked Farha to switch the ceiling fan off for a while so that she could gather up the dust. Farha had scolded her saying, “_Why are you asking me this? Who are you in this house?_”. After she said that, she had slapped the victim and pushed her to the floor. Whilst the victim was on the floor, Farha had taken the broom and hit the victim with it on the calves a few times. The victim got up. Farha then grabbed her neck from the back and pushed her towards the wall on the left side of the main door. This caused the left side of the victim’s face and her left shoulder to hit against the wall, causing her to feel pain.

#### Farha - the 5th to 8th charges (MAC 900961-4/18)

20     These series of assaults occurred on 31 Dec 16. It was a Saturday. Both Farha and Tasleem were at home.

21     The first incident happened in the master bedroom. The victim had taken Farha’s breakfast into the bedroom. At Farha’s direction, she had placed the breakfast tray on the floor. After the victim had done so, Farha had gotten up from her bed and kicked the victim twice on her lower back. Farha had not said anything when she kicked the victim. The victim fell to the floor when she was kicked[^21].

22     Farha then grabbed the victim by her hair, and pulled her out of the bedroom, towards the corridor just outside the common bathroom. Farha then told the victim that she and Tasleem were bringing their sons out. She told the victim to get their clothes ready. When the victim got up, Farha had punched her on the nose once. This caused her pain and her nose bled. She went into the common bathroom to wash up and clean her face. After that, she went into the children’s bedroom to get their clothes ready[^22].

23     While she was doing this, Farha had entered the children’s bedroom and grabbed the victim’s hair and then pushed her towards the open cupboard. Farha then grabbed the victim’s hair again and then pushed her towards the wall on the right of the cupboard. This caused her right temple to hit the wall. Farha then slapped her a few times and threw her down to the floor[^23].

24     When she was on the floor, Farha then took a toy stick, which the victim had described as similar in shape to a hockey stick, and she had hit both the victim’s calves with it two to three times. The beatings had caused her pain. The victim said that at this time, Tasleem was standing outside the children’s room and witnessed the beatings. Without a word, he had entered the room and took away the children’s clothes and left[^24].

25     Five minutes later, the victim left the children’s room for the living room to iron the clothes. Farha had taken the toy stick and placed it on the dining table located in the living room. She told the victim that the family was going out to the park. She warned the victim that she had to complete all her chores in five minutes, failing which she would beat the victim with the toy stick and throw her out the window. She also said that if people asked her what had happened, she would tell them that the victim’s “_mental state of mind was not good_”. The victim testified that Farha had said these words in an angry tone. Farha and her family then left the flat. The victim felt fear because she thought that Farha would kill her[^25].

#### Tasleem – the 1st charge (MCN 900632/18)

26     The incident happened sometime towards the middle of December 2016[^26]. The victim was in the kitchen getting ready to take Ashir out, when Tasleem instructed her to make powdered milk for Ashir. Annoyed by the slowness in preparing the milk, Tasleem had scolded her saying, “_why aren’t you making it faster_?”. Then he punched her on her right eye once. The victim cried in pain.

#### Tasleem – the 2nd charge (MCN 900633/18)

27     The second incident happened some eight or nine days after the first incident. The victim was then cleaning the windows in Tasleem’s bedroom. He had kicked her twice on her lower back or waist area using a thrusting motion of his leg. The victim fell to the floor next to the bed. According to her, Tasleem had not said anything before or after he had kicked her.

#### How the victim escaped from the flat

28     When the accused persons and their sons left the flat (see \[25\]), Farha's ominous words kept running in the victim’s mind. Fearful that she would be beaten again when they returned to the flat, the victim decided to leave the flat even though the main door was locked and she did not have the key. She decided to escape via the window in the living room. She gathered her clothes from the cupboard in the living room and put them into her luggage. She then opened the living room windows and placed her luggage on a ledge outside. After that she clambered out the window and stood on the same ledge. She was crying throughout the ordeal.

29     Her crying and shouts for help were noticed by a Chinese couple who were walking at the ground floor. The couple called out to some workers who were in the vicinity doing paint works for help. One of the workers, Mani, used a gondola which had been erected at the flat to bring the victim down from the ledge to the ground floor. On the ground floor, the victim had told the Chinese couple that both her “_Madam and Sir had beat (sic) me_”. She had also told a female Punjabi who was there the same thing. The police were called to the scene.

30     The prosecution also relied on the contemporaneous evidence of three independent witnesses, namely (i) Mani Manoharan (“Mani”), the worker who had helped bring the victim down from the fourth floor ledge, (ii) Inspector Mubarak Bin A Mohamad Ali (“Insp Mubarak”), who was the officer who had gone to the scene, and taken photographs of the victim’s injuries at the scene, and (iii) Station Inspector Nazri Bin Suhaimi (“SI Nazri”), who was the first responder at the scene and had spoken to the victim. Their evidence touched on the victim’s demeanour and behaviour on that day when she was rescued from the ledge.

#### The medical evidence

31     The victim was medically examined by Dr Muntramoorthy Karthikeyan (“Dr Muntramoorthy”). The medical report of the medical examination prepared by Dr Benedict Lau (“Dr Lau”) based on Dr Muntramoorthy’s clinical noted was admitted into evidence. The medical report stated that there were –

> (a)     “_obvious bruise noted over both sides of face with swelling over both cheeks and tender to touch_”,

> (b)     “_tenderness over entire posterior midline and para-midline of spine on palpation_”, and

> (c)     “_scattered bruises over both upper and lower limb_”.

32     The diagnosis was multiple contusions due to blunt injury. Dr Muntramoorthy had confirmed that the injuries seen in the victim’s police photographs were likely caused by blunt force trauma. He also rejected the sugestion that the injuries could have been caused by either a toddler hitting her or the accidental bumping into things. Dr Muntramoorthy also noted a linear erythematous mark on the victim’s right upper back. This injury was not in the medical report.

33     Dr Lau also came to the same conclusion that the bruises were consistent with blunt force trauma. He also gave evidence on the age of the bruises seen on the victim’s body. He was of the view that the bruises documented were at least one day’s old to four weeks’ old ie –

> (a)     The bruises under her left eye was less than a week old,

> (b)     The bruises over her left upper arm were about a week to 10 days’ old, and

> (c)     The bruise on her left leg was less than a week old.

### The defence’s case

34     Both Farha and Tasleem denied all the allegations of assault. Farha also denied that on 31 Dec 16, she had threatened to throw the victim off the flat and tell people that the victim had mental issues if they asked why she had jumped. The defence’s main arguments were –

> (a)     The alleged injuries seen on the victim were uneven skin tones/marks which the victim had allegedly said were caused when she had worked in the fields in India.

> (b)     Alternatively, the marks were caused by accident, or by their son Ashir, who might have hit her in the course of their daily interaction as he was a very hyperactive child.

> (c)     The victim was unhappy and bore a grudge against the accused persons because (i) they had rejected her request to let her do domestic work for other households for extra money, and (ii) she had been informed that she would be sent home if she did not perform her work satisfactorily, and she did not want to be sent back home.

35     The defence attacked the veracity of the victim’s testimony primarily by highlighting the discrepancies and inconsistencies in her evidence of the assaults. The defence also pointed out that she was able to leave the flat at any time of her choosing because she had unrestricted access to the keys to the metal gate and main door. In addition, they also asserted that she had not reported the abuses despite having many opportunities to do so. These included friends of the accused persons when they came to the flat, and other domestic helpers who she met when she was at the playground with their sons.

36     In particular, the defence highlighted two instances where the victim had the opportunity to report the abuses but did not. The first was during the medical examination conducted by Dr Gurmit Singh (“Dr Singh”) at his clinic at the Apollo Medical Centre on 17 Nov 16 to certify her fitness to work as a domestic helper. The defence pointed out that Dr Singh had reported that he had not seen any injury on the victim. The second was when the victim was at the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) to process her work permit, she had not reported the abuses to the MOM officers there.

37     In their attempt to rebut the medical evidence of Dr Muntramoorthy and Dr Lau, the defence raised four possible reasons for the marks found on the victim’s body. They claimed that the marks were not bruises (contrary to the conclusions of the medical doctors) but were (i) uneven skin tones, or (ii) sustained by the victim when she had worked in the fields in India, or (iii) caused accidentally, or (iv) caused during her interactions with their hyperactive younger son, Ashir.

38     The defence contended that the victim had fabricated the abuses and devised the elaborate and dramatic plan of escape. She did all these so that she could free herself from the employment contract with the accused persons and avoid being sent home. This was because the accused persons had warned her that she would be sent home.

### The findings of the court

#### The considerations to apply when assessing credibility

39     In the present case, as in most maid abuse cases, the victim was the prosecution’s main witness. The principal issue therefore was her credibility. It was therefore critical to bear in mind the considerations that I needed to bear in mind and apply when assessing her credibility.

40     There was no absolute prohibition or legal impediment in convicting an accused person on the evidence of a single witness. However, I should always be mindful of the inherent danger of such a conviction. The victim’s evidence must be subjected to close scrutiny. Her testimony must be so compelling to the extent that a conviction could be found entirely on it. A finding on credibility could be based on some or all of the following –

> (a)     Demeanour;

> (b)     The internal consistency or lack thereof in the content of the victim’s evidence;

> (c)     The external consistency or lack thereof between the content of the victim’s evidence and extrinsic evidence. Extrinsic evidence referred to the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits.

41     The offences were committed between November to December 2016, some two years before the trial. The victim’s evidence should be assessed in that context. Human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection must be borne in mind. The victim should not be found to be less credible merely because there were inconsistencies and discrepancies in her evidence.

42     In the present case, the discrepancies or inconsistencies that arose concerned the dates and times of the abuses, and the details of the abuses inflicted on the victim. The question that I should ask myself was whether the discrepancies or inconsistencies were so material that they destroyed her credibility. Even if the discrepancies and inconsistencies were not material, I should ask the question whether there was a systematic and widespread pattern of many discrepancies or inconsistencies coming together which ought to destroy the victim’s credibility. Even if a few of the discrepancies or inconsistencies appeared to be material, it was trite law that while a witness might be flawed, it did not mean that he or she was untruthful. In my deliberation, I should distinguish innocent inconsistencies from deliberate lies. I had the duty to weigh the evidence in the light of all the other evidence carefully to arrive at the truth. Lastly, there was no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all. I should determine which part remained credible despite there being discrepancies.

#### The credibility of the victim

43     I would now address the discrepancies and inconsistencies in the victim’s account as highlighted by the defence.

##### (1)   The 1st charge against Farha (MAC 900957/18)

44     The defence argued that the victim’s evidence in examination-in-chief (at \[11\] to \[13\]) was inconsistent with her testimony during cross-examination. The inconsistencies highlighted by the defence were –

> (a)     She had said that she was slapped on her left ear, as compared to her left cheek during examination-in-chief.

> (b)     She had said that the slapping incident happened in the afternoon, while during examination-in-chief she said it had happened in the morning.

> (c)     She had failed to mention that she had been punched during cross-examination.

45     In my opinion, the difference between being slapped on the left ear as against the left cheek was not material. I agreed with DPP Houston’s submission that it was a minor discrepancy. This was because the area of the left cheek was contiguous to the left ear. She could have been mistaken on precisely where the blow had landed. What was significant was the fact that she was consistent that she was slapped on the left side of her face. As for the inconsistency in the time of day the incident had occurred, I noted that the victim had consistently maintained that the assault had occurred when she was making chapatis for the family. The evidence showed that she made chapatis after she had picked Ashaz from school because it was the family’s routine to have lunch after Ashaz had returned home from school at 12.30 pm. I found that the inconsistency in the time of day the assault had taken place was not material.

46     However, I accepted that the omission to mention the punch during cross-examination was a discrepancy. When asked about it in re-examination, she maintained that she had been punched but that she had forgotten to mention this during cross-examination. I found that the discrepancy was not so material that it affected her overall veracity. I noted that when the victim was cross-examined on this point, she had been on the stand for three days, fielding many questions from the DPP and Mr Fernando. I accepted her explanation for the omission.

##### (2)   The 2nd charge against Farha (MAC 900958/18)

47     In cross-examination, the victim had said that the incident had happened in the evening. In her examination-in-chief, she said it had happened in the morning. Other than this discrepancy, she was consistent in the other material aspects of the incident. I did not find the discrepancy to be material. What was significant was the fact that she had maintained that she was cooking chapati at the time. It was significant to note that the rolling pin which was used to assault the victim, was an integral part of making chapati ie it was used to flatten the chapati bread dough before it was cooked. There was every reason for it to be there when Farha had used it to physically abuse the victim.

##### (3)   The 9th and 10th charges against Farha (MAC 900965-6/18)

48     The only inconsistency that featured in the victim’s testimony was the fact that she had said that when these incidences of assault took place, she was making chapatis for breakfast. The accused persons had denied that they ate chapatis for breakfast. Again, I did not find the inconsistency to be material. I noted that the victim’s testimony was consistent in the other material aspects. She had demonstrated how she had used the tongs when cooking the chapatis. She demonstrated how she had used them to hold the chapati bread above the naked flame of the hob for about 10 seconds to allow the bread to expand. The proximity of the tongs to the naked flame would have caused the tongs to become hot. She had also pointed to a linear scar on her right arm corresponding to the first photograph in Exhibit P60, which she said was where Farha had touched her with the heated tongs.

49     The victim had testified that Farha had scolded her for not making chapati properly. Farha confirmed that she had showed the victim how to cook the chapati. The method she had taught the victim was to place the cooked chapati on the flat plate which was over a stove, and then use a piece of cloth to puff the chapati up and thereafter keep it in a hot pot. The method minimised incidences of the chapati getting charred during cooking. Holding the chapati over a naked flame as that done by the victim increased the risk of the chapati getting charred. That was why Farha had been angry with her which resulted in the assaults with the tongs on both occasions.

##### (4)   The 3rd charge against Farha (MAC 900959/18)

50     The defence contended that the victim had embellished her testimony during cross-examination when she added that (i) the assault had occurred around 4.00 pm, and (ii) Farha had slapped her as she was crying after the assault and pushed her. These were not disclosed by her during examination-in-chief. I noted that other than these two inconsistencies, her evidence was significantly consistent in all the other material aspects. In fact, her evidence of the circumstances that led to the assault was confirmed by Farha herself. The victim had said that Farha had scolded her for not managing the children and for not bathing them properly. This was consistent with Farha’s account that she had scolded the victim in the bathroom that day for using hot water to bathe Ashir which caused him to cry, and for using the same shampoo to wash the children’s body and hair. I found that the inconsistencies did not affect her overall credibility.

##### (5)   The 4th charge against Farha (MAC 900960/18)

51     The defence submitted that the victim was inconsistent with respect to whether she was grabbed on the neck by Farha. This was because during cross-examination, the victim had omitted to say that Farha had grabbed her by the neck when she pushed the victim to the wall., I did not regard this to be an inconsistency. The victim’s description during examination-in-chief about how Farha had grabbed her by the neck and pushed her to the wall clearly showed that the act of grabbing her neck and pushing her to the wall constituted one fluid, continuous motion. The main point of her evidence was to say that Farha had pushed her to the wall. Therefore, it was understandable that she had not specifically repeated that she was grabbed on the neck during cross-examination when she said she was pushed to the wall, having already mentioned it in examination-in-chief.

##### (6)   The 5th to 8th charges against Farha (MAC 900961-4/18)

52     The attack on the victim’s credibility in relation to these series of charges were as follow –

> (a)     It was physically impossible for Farha to pull the victim’s hair backwards and dragged her while the victim was on all fours ie on her hands and knees.

> (b)     The victim’s claim that the main door was always locked and she did not have the key could not be true. This was because she had actually taken her clothes which were hung to dry outside the flat, save for two items of clothing, which she had left on the drying pole, before she escaped via the window.

> (c)     The victim had not perched dangerously on the ledge but had instead stood by the window and cried for help.

53     I agreed with DPP Houston that the defence had mischaracterised the victim’s evidence in relation to her being dragged by her hair backwards while she as on her hands and knees. She had said that when Farha had pulled her backwards, she was squatting on the floor[^27]. Therefore, she was not already on all fours at the time. Further, more importantly, at the time, the victim was not unconscious; nor was she in a catatonic state. Because of the pain from the pulling of the hair, I found it was reasonable to expect the victim to reflexively move in the direction of the pull, albeit against her will.

54     I rejected Farha’s testimony that the victim always had access to the main door key because she had taken her clothes, saved for two items of clothes, which had been left to dry outside the flat before she climbed out the window onto the ledge. I noted that this was a bare assertion on her part. It was also inexplicable that after having the presence of mind to unlock the door to take her clothes away, the victim had left two items of clothing behind.

55     The defence’s contention that the victim was not on the ledge but instead had stood by the window and called for help was against the weight of the evidence. The worker, Mani, had maintained in both examination-in-chief and cross-examination that he had seen the victim on the ledge. SI Nazri had also testified that the witnesses whom he had spoken to had said that the victim was seen on the ledge, which supported Mani’s account. Their accounts were also consistent with the first information report[^28], which stated that the victim was seen sitting on the ledge.

56     I noted that the victim’s account of the sequence of events on that day were significantly similar to the accused persons’ accounts, save for the assaults and the threat. The similarities were –

> (a)     The victim had prepared breakfast;

> (b)     The accused persons had their breakfast in the master bedroom;

> (c)     Farha had seen the victim in the children’s room;

> (d)     Before the accused persons left the flat with their sons, the victim was ironing clothes in the living room;

> (e)     Farha had scolded the victim for not preparing breakfast in time, and it was not completely done; and

> (f)     Farha had warned the victim to finish all her chores such as ironing the clothes and changing the bedsheets before they returned to the flat.

57     Tasleem had testified that he was the one who had brought the breakfast into the master bedroom that morning. If his evidence was accepted, this would mean that the victim was not in the bedroom and therefore the assault could not have taken place. However, Tasleem’s account was inconsistent with Farha’s evidence in her examination-in-chief and what she said in her long statement[^29]. In examination-in-chief, Farha had said that she had directed the victim to prepare breakfast, but she did not see who had brought it into the bedroom. However, in her long statement, she had said that the victim had brought in the breakfast, and at that point of time, Tasleem and her two sons were inside the bedroom with her. I found that the weight of the evidence pointed to the victim as the one who had brought the breakfast into the bedroom. Tasleem had fabricated his evidence about bringing in the breakfast because he wanted to cast doubt on the victim’s allegation that Farha had assaulted her in the master bedroom. This was because if the breakfast had been brought in by him, then the victim was never in the master bedroom and so the assault could not have happened.

58     The preceding paragraphs clearly showed that there were inconsistencies and discrepancies in some aspects of the victim’s testimony. In assessing her credibility in the light of these inconsistencies and discrepancies, I constantly reminded myself that human observation and recollection was not infallible. The critical issue was whether the totality of the evidence suggested that the evidence in respect of the material elements of the charges were untrue or unreliable. I found that in this case, looking at the evidence in totality, the victim’s evidence in respect of the material elements were true and reliable.

59     On the other hand, Farha had a clear motive to commit the assaults on the victim. She had employed the victim to help her take care of the household chores and her children so that she could engage in her own pursuits. As she had acknowledged in her testimony, the victim was the solution for her to do other things and eventually to return to the workforce[^30]. However, the victim’s ineptitude became a constant source of anger and frustration for her[^31]. The victim’s ineptitude has been documented in the course of the trial, for example, making chapatis the wrong way despite having been taught the proper way, using the same shampoo to wash the hair and bodies of Farha’s sons, and being slow in making breakfast. As a result of the anger and frustration, she took it out on the victim by physically abusing her.

##### (7)   The 1st and 2nd charges (MCN 900632/18 and MCN 900633/18) against Tasleem

60     The victim’s account of the two incidents of assault involving Tasleem was consistent throughout both in examination-in-chief and cross-examination in relation to the how, where and when Tasleem had assaulted her. In fact, the defence was unable to highlight any discrepancy or inconsistency in her evidence, other than pointing out the lack of motive and opportunity for Tasleem to commit the offences.

61     On the question of opportunity, the evidence showed that Tasleem was on block leave in the first two weeks of December 2016. He would be at home for most of the two weeks. This block leave period coincided with the victim’s testimony that she had been assaulted by Tasleem towards the middle of December. As for motive, the evidence showed that he had been triggered by the victim’s ineptness at her work[^32], and the constant complaints that he had received from Farha about the victim’s poor work performance. Like Farha, he had wanted someone to help with the household work and the care of his children, especially Ashir, who suffered from ADHD and autism. Rather than being the solution to the problem, the victim became the problem and was a source of his annoyance because of the constant complaints from Farha about her sub-standard performance[^33]. This had caused him to lash out at the victim on the two occasions.

62     In court, Tasleem had denied being annoyed with the victim because of her poor work performance. But his denial was inconsistent with what he had said in his police statement[^34], where he admitted that he had scolded the victim on more than one occasion for making mistakes in her work. When confronted with the inconsistency, he explained that what he had actually wanted to say in his police statement was that he had wanted to teach the victim and correct her mistakes. I found his explanation contrived and I rejected it. I agreed with DPP Johannus that Tasleem was highly educated and has a good command of English. It would not have been difficult for him to phrase his statement accordingly to reflect exactly what he had wanted to convey. The contrived explanation was an attempt to conceal the fact that he had felt rancour towards the victim, in order to show a lack of motive.

#### The victim’s failure to report abuses despite numerous opportunities to do so

63     The defence contended that the victim’s failure to report the physical abuses despite having multiple opportunities to do led to the conclusion that she had fabricated them. In this regard, I think that one must bear in mind that the employer-employee relationship in the case of a domestic helper was an unequal one. The domestic worker was almost always completely under the control of the employer. She was reliant on the employer for her accommodation, food and salary. Additionally, the lack of education and experience in living in a foreign country, coupled with the language barrier, augmented the sense of vulnerability and isolation. Bearing all these in mind, the reluctance exhibited by the victim in reporting the physical abuses suffered by her was understandable and reasonable. See Kee Oon J had made the observation in _Ang Lilian v PP[^35]_ that “_…a failure to attempt escape or to seek help could be equally indicative of the extent of the victim’s vulnerability and abject fear of her employer (to the extent that she does not dare to escape or seek help)_”, and that “_…the courts should recognise that the act of reporting an abusive employer would have required a degree of fortitude on the victim’s part_”[^36]. I have had the opportunity to assess the victim over a period of three days when she gave her testimony. It was my assessment that she did not possess that degree of fortitude. She came across as soft-spoken and timid. There were two or three instances during her testimony when she had lost her composure, which showed that she was still emotionally affected by the abuses inflicted on her more than two years ago.

64     The same observations apply to the omission to complain about the abuses to Dr Singh when he examined her at his clinic on 17 Nov 16 to assess her fitness to work as a domestic helper, and when the victim was at MOM to process her work permit. By this time, the victim had already suffered two (1st and 10th charges), possibly three (2nd charge) incidents of physical abuse. Farha was present during the medical examination by Dr Singh and when the victim was at MOM.

65     The fact that Dr Singh had not reported seeing any injury on the victim was neutral at best. He had examined her to certify her fitness for employment as a domestic helper. He did not examine her for injuries[^37]. This was consistent with the victim’s evidence that Dr Singh had only checked her height, weight, eye-sight and conducted a urine test, and that he had not done a physical examination for injuries[^38]. And Dr Singh also clarified that when he stated in his medical report[^39] that there was “_no noticeable injuries seen_”, he was referring to the exposed part of her body, specifically her face[^40]. At the time of the examination by Dr Singh, the only assault on the victim’s face was the slap and punch on 9 Nov 16. In this regard, it was likely that there was no noticeable injury. Whether such an assault would manifest in a mark or bruise depended on the amount of force used.

66     It should be noted that the victim had only taken the drastic decision to escape from the flat after she was subjected to a series of assaults, followed by the threat to kill her and make it appear as suicide. For her, the escalation of the violence accompanied by the ominous threat on her life was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back.

67     All considered, I found that the victim was a credible witness. Admittedly there were some inconsistencies in some aspects of her evidence. But I found that they were not material. They did not affect her overall credibility. I did not find that there was a systematic and widespread pattern of many discrepancies or inconsistencies coming together that operated to destroy or affect her credibility.

#### Adverse inference against the amendment of some of the charges at the end of the prosecution’s case?

68     DPP Johannes amended five out of the ten charges against Farha before closing the case for the prosecution. For example, the victim did not state that she had been kicked multiple times on her back and legs (which particulars were part of the original 6th charge); or that the particulars of the 9th and 10th charges in relation to the assault with the tongs had essentially been swapped.

69     I was of the opinion that these amendments of the charges did not undermine the overall veracity or reliability of the victim’s evidence. The trial was some two years after the commission of the offences; and involved a series of 12 incidents of assaults. Against that backdrop and having regard to the fallibility of human observation and recollection, discrepancies and inconsistencies would be inevitable. It was therefore unrealistic to expect a perfectly matched set of testimonies, charges and submissions: _Tay Wee Kiat and another v PP and another appeal_[^41] (“_Tay Wee Kiat_”) The key question to ask was whether the totality of the evidence suggested that the evidence in respect of the material elements of the charges were untrue or unreliable.

70     I agreed with DPP Houston’s submission that the amendments were not so consequential that they undermined the veracity or reliability of the victim’s evidence. The amendment to the charge in MAC 900958-18 was not material. Whether the area struck by the rolling pin was the right or left shoulder was not significant as they were on the general area of the victim’s upper back. The amendment to the MAC 900964-18 was related to a grammatical error only. The amendments to the two incidents involving the pair of tongs (MAC 900965-18 and MAC 900966-18) was because of some confusion over the dates in which they had occurred. More importantly, the victim’s evidence in relation to the manner in which she was assaulted with the tongs on both occasions remained unchanged. Lastly, I found that the amendment to MAC 900963-18 which related to the particulars of the assault was also not so consequential as to affect her overall credibility. It should be noted that on 31 Dec 16, the victim was subjected to a series of assaults that started from the master bedroom that continued in the children’s room, and which ended with the veiled threat to kill in the living room. As such, it was not unreasonable – in fact it was quite inevitable – that she had forgotten to state that she was kicked on the legs and back, and that she had been pushed to the wall. In any event, the victim’s account of the sequence of the assaults was consistent both in examination-in-chief and cross-examination.

71     In relation to the two charges against Tasleem, I found that the amendments were not material. In MCN 900632-18, the allegation in the original charge was that she was punched on the left eye. This was amended to the right eye. The discrepancy was not material as the punch was to the area of the face. In MCN 900633-18, the phrase “_about two or three times_” was amended to “_about two times_”. This was not so much a discrepancy as an attempt by the victim to be more specific in the number of times she was kicked.

#### The victim’s testimony was externally consistent

72     The testimony of the victim was consistent with the medical evidence in relation to the marks found on her face and body. She gave the following accounts of the injuries (as shown in the photographs)[^42] suffered by her –

> (a)     The bruise under her eyes[^43] were the result of being punched by Farha and Tasleem[^44];

> (b)     The mark above the left eyebrow[^45] was the result of the attack by Farha in the children’s room on 31 Dec 16[^46];

> (c)     The marks on her cheeks[^47] were caused when Farha had slapped her[^48];

> (d)     The bruises on her left upper arm[^49] was caused when Farha had hit her with the shower head[^50]; and

> (e)     The bruise on her left leg[^51] was caused when Farha had hit her with the toy stick on 31 Dec 16.

73     The medical report[^52] corroborated the victim’s testimony on the injuries suffered by her. The diagnosis was one of multiple contusion due to blunt injury. The descriptions reported were as follows –

>      _“obvious bruise noted over both sides of face with swelling over both cheeks and tender to touch”_,

>      _“tenderness over entire posterior midline and para-midline of spine on palpation”, and_

>      _“scattered bruises over both upper and lower limb”._

74     There was one injury which Dr Muntramoorthy had noted and which was not included in the medical report prepared by Dr Lau. This was a linear erythematous mark on her right upper back[^53]. When asked, Dr Muntramoorthy stated his opinion that the linear mark could have been caused by being hit with a rolling pin[^54].

75     Dr Muntramoorthy had also confirmed that all the recorded injuries were likely to have been caused by blunt force trauma. He dismissed the possibility that they could have been caused by the victim’s interaction with the hyperactive Ashir or by her accidentally bumping into things[^55]. The medical evidence was consistent with her account of being slapped, punched, kicked and being hit. In another medical report[^56], Dr Lau had opined that the bruises seen on the victim were between one day to four weeks’ old. The range fell within the period of time in which the victim was physically abused. I have no reason to doubt the opinions of both Dr Muntramoorthy and Dr Lau.

76     The absence of any finding of a burn mark did not in my opinion discredit the victim’s evidence of the assault with the hot tongs. Given the description by the victim that the tong was over the naked flame for about 10 seconds could suggest that the tongs, though hot to the touch, was not sufficiently hot such that it would cause a burn mark on the skin.

#### Corroboration from the testimonies of other witnesses

77     The victim’s testimony was also corroborated by the evidence of other witnesses in relation to her emotional state on 31 Dec 16. On that day, her demeanour was consistent with the allegations that she had been abused by her employers. Mani had seen her crying on the window ledge. He remembered that she had continued to cry when he brought her down to the ground in the gondola. He also observed that her face was swollen because she had been crying[^57].

78     Insp Mubarak had testified that the victim appeared quite emotional, was teary-eyed, sullen and kept her head down, and looked a bit traumatised[^58]. She was barefoot and he had described her eyes are being quite dark. He also searched the victim’s luggage and found a few pieces of clothing inside. His colleague, SI Nazri, testified that he had seen injuries on her face and hands. In particular, he observed bruising around her eyes[^59]. He had also described her cheeks as being puffy.

79     I agreed with DPP Johannus’s submission that the observations of the three witnesses were probative of the victim’s being abused. They were independent witnesses. They have no reason to lie, fabricate or embellish their evidence. The haste with which the victim had made her escape was palpable from their accounts of her condition. This corroborated her testimony of being fearful for her safety after having been subjected to a litany of physical assaults and culminating in the threat to kill her. I did not think that she had staged the exhibition of desperation and fear as claimed by the defence. They were in my mind genuine emotions, which pointed to the truthfulness of her accounts of abuses and threat.

80     The defence’s contended that the victim knew that they were going to end her contract and send her home. She had staged her escape and the exhibition of distress and fear because she wanted to continue to stay and work in Singapore. However, the defence’s contention was not consistent with the evidence of the victim’s first employer, one Mandan Misra. He testified that he had informed the victim that he wanted to send her home to India because he had found her to be a poor worker. The victim had not reacted in any untoward or inappropriate manner. Rather she had accepted his decision without protest[^60]. Therefore, I found that the reason why she had acted in the manner described in the preceding paragraphs could only be because of the abuses and the threat made to her by Farha.

#### The defence’s explanation for the injuries

81     Farha testified that the victim had told her that the marks on her body were uneven skin tones and/or marks. Farha elaborated that the victim had informed her that she had received these marks when she had worked in a farm or field in India before she came to Singapore to work. This explanation flew in the face of the medical evidence adduced. First, the medical evidence concluded that the marks were bruises, and were consistent with those caused by blunt force trauma. More importantly, the age of these bruises corresponded with the period when the victim was employed in the accused persons’ household, and not when she was working in some farm in India. Farha’s evidence was patently untrue.

#### The photographs showing family outings with the victim

82     The defence tendered four photographs[^61] and a bank statement[^62] as proof that the assaults on 24 Dec 16 (9th charge) and 26 Dec 16 (3rd charge) could not have happened. This was because these exhibits showed that the family was out of the house on the two dates.

83     In relation to the 24 Dec 16 incident, the defence contended that photographs D2, D24 and D25 was proof that the family and the victim had gone to City Square Mall the whole day. They even had their dinner there. Photographs D24 and D25 showed the boys posing in what appeared to be an indoor playground which the defence claimed was located in City Square Mall. Photograph D2 showed the victim with the two boys seated in a bus. The defence claimed that they were in the bus on the way to City Square Mall. The bank statement (D27) was produced as proof that they had dinner at one of the restaurants at the Mall on that day. Exhibit D27 showed a credit card transaction of a meal in a restaurant.

84     I noted that, other than the defence’s assertion, there was nothing in photographs D24 and D25 to indicate that the playground had been taken at City Square Mall. There was also no evidence that photograph D2 had been taken on 24 Dec 16 other than the defence asserting this in court. This was because photograph D2 did not have a date stamp like those in photographs D24 and D25. As such, I could not be certain that the victim was with the family on that day. It was pertinent to note that the boys’ attires were wearing entirely different clothes in photograph D2 compared to photographs D24 and D25. The defence had tried to explain this away by saying that the boys had changed their clothes because Ashir had spilled Milo drink on Ashaz and himself. There was one other difference found in the photographs which suggested that photograph D2 was not taken on the same day as the other two photographs. I noted that the lanyard worn by Ashaz in photographs D24 and D25 was different from the one he had worn in photograph D2. The lanyard in photographs D24 and D25 had a white patch on it. In photograph D2, the white patch was noticeably absent. DPP Johannus had also submitted that Ashaz’s hair fringe was shorter when compared to photograph D25. However, I hesitated to make that finding as I could not say with any degree of confidence that the difference was clearly noticeable. Therefore, all considered, I rejected the contention that photograph D2 was taken on 24 Dec 16.

85     In relation to the bank statement, there were some transactions relating to City Square Mall on 24 Dec 16, including a meal at the Pizza Hut there. However, the bank statement did not include the time stamps to show when the various transactions were made. There were two entries on 24 Dec 16 which I found significant. These entries were in relation to Uber. These two entries suggested that the accused persons and their sons had taken Uber to and from City Square Mall. If that was the case, then it further lend credence to the conclusion that photograph D2 could not have been taken on 24 Dec 16 as the family had not taken the bus to City Square Mall as the defence had claimed.

86     In relation to the incident of assault on 26 Dec 16, photograph D26 was admitted as proof that the family had gone out to Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”) on that day. Photograph D26 featured Ashir posing in what appeared to be a Mall, which the defence claimed was MBS. The point of introducing this evidence was to support the defence’s case theory that as the family was at MBS on that day, therefore the assault could not have happened. It was pertinent to note that Farha had confirmed that the incident in the bathroom between the victim and her on 26 Dec 16 had occurred before the family had gone out of the house. Therefore, the fact that the family was at MBS was neither here nor there. Photograph D2 has no probative value to the case.

#### The letter written by the victim that seemingly exonerated the accused persons

87     The victim had written a letter in Punjabi[^63] that purportedly exonerated the accused persons of all the allegations. In the letter, the victim had written that she wished to “_withdraw this case_”, and that she did not have “_any problem with my employer_”. The victim had testified that she had been coerced by Tasleem and Neelam, her agent in India and also her cousin who hailed from the same village, into writing the letter. The victim’s evidence[^64] was that Neelam had harassed her into meeting Tasleem at Khatib MRT station. At this meeting, Tasleem had offered her money and promised to help her brothers to obtain jobs in India if she told the Court that the injuries on her were the result of her falling in the bathroom. She refused. Subsequently, Neelam had harassed her continuously, and also used emotional blackmail ie, telling her that because of the case, Farha had not been able to return to India even though her father had passed away. The victim finally relented. Neelam then dictated to her what to write over the phone. The victim confirmed that the part in the letter about her family problems were true. But the part about her employer was untrue. At Neelam’s instructions, after she had written the letter, she met Tasleem outside the temple and handed the letter to him. Neelam had told her that Tasleem would mail the letter to the authorities. The victim’s evidence was straight-forward, candid and withstood cross-examination.

88     Tasleem’s account of the event differed substantially. His version was that the victim had initiated the whole episode on her own. Essentially, his narration of the events was that the victim had wanted to meet him so that she could pass him the letter which she had written voluntarily. He said she wanted his help to deliver the letter to the Indian Embassy. He said he had hesitated to meet up with her but was compelled to do so.

89     However, his account fell apart when they were subjected to close scrutiny. He said that Neelam had told him about the victim’s request to meet him since early 2018. Despite his initial hesitation, he felt compelled on humanitarian grounds to meet her because he was told that she had attempted suicide. I found Tasleem’s explanation for agreeing to meet the victim incongruous. Firstly, Tasleem had accused her of making false allegations against Farha and him (see his cautioned statements D14 and D15). Secondly, they had not been in contact with one another for two years before the alleged call from Neelam. The victim was also no longer his domestic helper and therefore no longer in his care. There appeared to be no good reason why he should have agreed to meet her.

90     For the sake of argument, assuming that what Tasleem said above was true, then this constituted a crucial aspect of his defence. Yet they were never put to the victim during her cross-examination. During Tasleem’s cross-examination, he offered another reason for meeting the victim. He said that he had felt pressured into doing so by her family who had wanted him to send her home. Similarly, this was never put to the victim during her cross-examination. In any event, Tasleem’s evidence that he was pressured into meeting the victim was at best incoherent. According to him, Neelam had only called him three to four times about the victim’s request for his help to send her home. Significantly, he did not agree that this had constituted as pressure to meet her. For all these reasons, I did not accept Tasleem’s evidence that the victim had initiated the meeting and the writing of the letter, and that he was pressured into meeting her.

91     Tasleem had also exhibited a tendency to fabricate evidence on the fly. The victim had said that she had handed the letter to Tasleem personally outside a Sikh temple. During her cross-examination, it transpired that her account was consistent with the defence’s. This was clear from the question that Mr Fernando had put to the victim - “_Sir \[Tasleem\] has also informed that it was on the 20th of May 2018…that’s my instructions, it is when he went to the temple, you met him and you handed him the letter. He remembers this as the date that you handed him the letter[^65]_. In the context of the instruction to Mr Fernando, it was pertinent to note that during his examination-in-chief, Tasleem had said that the letter had been sent to him by mail. When asked about the inconsistency during his cross-examination, Tasleem agreed that the victim had passed him the letter at the temple, but he had returned it to her after that. This was clearly an afterthought because during his examination-in-chief, he had not said that he had returned the letter to the victim after she had handed it to him. Further, this was also not put to the victim during her cross-examination. These series of evidence clearly point to that fact that Tasleem’s evidence that he had handed the letter back to the victim was a fabrication.

92     Tasleem had also testified that during the meeting, the victim had told him about her family situation, that she had made the false allegations in order to go home, and that she planned to pass a letter to the Indian Embassy to admit that she had made false allegations against the accused persons so that she could be sent home. According to him, she had recounted to him about a friend’s experience wherein the friend’s employer had helped to pass a letter written by the friend to the Indian Embassy, and this had led to the friend going home. This conversation was critical to the defence in so far as there was an admission by the victim that she had made false allegations against the accused persons. Yet it was significant that this conversation was not put to the victim. Again, the inference I drew from this omission was that no such conversation had taken place. Tasleem had fabricated the conversation in order to conceal his attempt at suborning the victim.

93     Lastly, in order to support his account that the whole episode was initiated by the victim, Tasleem admitted into evidence a series of Whatsapp messages purportedly between the two of them[^66]. Howevr, these messages were not shown to the victim. She was also not asked any question about them during her cross-examination. There was no reason why they could not have been produced and the victim confronted with them. The messages were exchanged between 13 May 18 to 9 Sep 18. That meant that they were in existence about one month before the trial commenced. Tasleem was unable to give a cogent answer when asked to explain the omission[^67]. Secondly, it transpired that the mobile number in the Whatsapp messages that the defence claimed was the victim’s, was actually not her mobile number. The mobile number had belonged to one Harpreet Singh[^68]. It was terminated on 14 Jan 19. Other than Harpreet Singh, no one else had used the mobile number before 14 Jan 19. Thirdly, I found it suspicious that Tasleem had saved the said mobile number under “SG Helper Contact”, and not under the victim’s name. For all these reasons, I found the authenticity of the Whatsapp messages in serious doubt. I therefore did not give any weight to them.

94     For the reasons set out above, I did not find Tasleem to be a credible witness. I rejected his account about the genesis of the letter and about the meeting with the victim. I accepted the victim’s account as unlike him, she came across as credible and she was forthright in her testimony.

## The mitigation plea

95     Both accused persons were first offenders.

96     Mr Fernando highlighted the following mitigating factors for the accused persons –

> (a)     Tasleem was the sole breadwinner of the family. There was a likelihood that he would lose his employment over the case, which would present him with an uphill struggle to continue to provide for his family.

> (b)     Farha was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with peripartum onset. She had suffered from low mood for the last six years, ever since she was pregnant with her younger son, Ashir. Her condition placed her at high risk of suffering a deterioration of mood and anxiety if she was sentenced to imprisonment. Subsequently, in 2018, Farha was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress and Prolonged Grief. This was due to several stressors –

>> (i)       The strain in caring for Ashir, who suffered from Austin Spectrum Disorder, Level 3, with accompanying intellectual and language, and social and occupational impairments;

>> (ii)       The prolonged grief over the death of her father in June 2018;

>> (iii)       The worry over the outcome of the present case.

> (c)     Any term of imprisonment for the accused persons would inflict undue hardship on their young sons. They would be adversely affected. This was especially true for Farha simply because she was their main caregiver and they were very attached to her. Ashir would be more affected as his condition required substantial support and care, and it was important that his occupational and speech therapy sessions continued without interruption.

97     Mr Fernando highlighted the community work that both had done. Tasleem had, on several occasions, been engaged in community service such as providing training in Microsoft skills for the Handicaps Welfare Association as well as participated in fundraising for the needy through his employer, BNP Paribas Bank. Farha on the other hand had been involved in raising funds for the Breast Cancer Awareness when she participated in the Pink Ribbon Walk for three consecutive years.

## The Sentence

98     In determining the appropriate sentences, I applied the three-step sentencing framework set out in _Tay Wee Kiat_. The parties agreed that the _Tay Wee Kiat_ sentencing framework applied to the case. They only differed in the application of the said framework, such that they arrived at diametrically different sentences. Their sentencing positions in relation to the two accused persons were set out in the tables below –

99     The three-step approach comprised the following – in the first step, the court has to determine the nature of the harm caused to the victim ie, was it predominantly physical, or both physical and psychological. The harm would be predominantly physical (coupled with the distress that the victim would invariably feel) if the acts did not form part of any broader pattern or history of abusive conduct and did not involve particularly degrading or humiliating treatment. In this case, the considerations that I have to bear in mind was “_the degree of harm as well as other aggravating and mitigating factors, bearing in mind other maid abuse precedents_”[^69]. It should be noted that a custodial sentence would invariably be warranted in maid abuse cases where there has been any manner of physical abuse.

100    There might be cases where there was the added dimension of significant psychological harm such that due weight should be given to it in sentencing. Where the harm is both physical and psychological, the second step was to identify the degree of harm caused in relation to each charge. The sentencing range at this stage should start at the level of months rather than days. In evaluating the degree of psychological harm caused, the court would usually have regard to any victim impact statement or psychological report of the victim, where available. The psychological harm should not be wholly disregarded simply because a victim impact statement was not available. The High Court set out the indicative ranges corresponding to the degree of harm caused -

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="36.18%"> <col width="33.7%"> <col width="30.12%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Less serious physical harm</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">More serious physical harm</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Less serious psychological harm</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3-6 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6-18 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">More serious psychological harm</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6-18 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">20-30 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

101    In the third step, the court would adjust the sentence for each charge in the light of other aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Having determined the individual sentences, the court would then decide which sentences to run consecutively and which concurrently in accordance with the principles in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_[^70] (“_Shoufee_”). In relation to multiple charges, the duration and frequency of abuse should be taken into account when determining whether to order more than two sentences to run consecutively (at \[75\] of _Shoufee_).

#### The charges against Farha

102    I rejected Mr Fernando’s submission that Farha fell into the lower end of the spectrum for both physical harm and psychological harm (ie the less serious physical harm and less serious psychological harm category) for all the nine charges, which put the charges into the indicative sentencing range of three to six months’ imprisonment. I also rejected his submission that there was no specific incident in all the nine charges that had amplified the psychological harm caused.

103    The evidence before me showed that over the period of two months, Farha had exhibited behaviour which was calculated to reinforce her authority and to oppress and bully the victim into submission. These have been set out in submissions of DPP Johannus. In response to the victim’s query about being scolded and beaten every day, she had said “_\[B\]ecause I’m the one who called for you to come here, I can do whatever I wish onto you_”. She had accused the victim of having an affair with Tasleem, simply because he had shown civility towards her initially. The victim suffered poor working conditions. She did not have the freedom to leave the house. It was apparent that the victim had been cowed into subservience. Farha’s conduct inflicted both physical and psychological harm.

104    On physical harm, the medical evidence supported the finding that the injuries suffered by the victim fell into the “less serious physical harm” category. These injuries comprised bruises, swellings and tenderness, and most had also healed completely by the time of the trial.

105    Of the nine charges under s 323 read with s73(2) PC against Farha, six fell into the “less serious physical harm and less serious psychological harm” category. These were the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 10th charges (see table at \[98\]). The indicative sentencing range was three to six months’ imprisonment.

106    I was of the view that the 1st and 5th charges fell within the lower end of the indicative sentencing range. Apart from the physical harm being less serious, I found that there was any psychological harm suffered by the victim save for some level of distress. For the 1st charge, there was no cogent evidence of injuries arising from the slap and punch, although the victim had felt pain. As such I was of the view that the sentence of three months’ imprisonment (the lowest end of the range) was appropriate. For the 5th charge, the kick was to the victim’s lower back which in my mind constituted a vulnerable part of the body. The evidence showed that she had suffered tenderness over the entire posterior midline and para-midline of her spine on palpation[^71]. As such, I was of the view that the sentence of four months’ imprisonment for the charge was appropriate.

107    For the 2nd, 7th, 9th and 10th charges, I found that the level of physical harm were the same as in the 1st, and 5th charges. These assaults had only caused minor physical injuries. In relation to the 2nd, 7th and 10th charges, the assaults were not persistent. However, Farha had used a rolling pin, a toy stick and a pair of tongs to physically assault the victim. As such, an uplift from the lowest of the indicative sentencing range was appropriate. In this case, I sentenced her to four months’ imprisonment for each of the four charges.

108    In relation to the 9th charge, the same pair of tongs in the 10th charge was used to assault the victim except that in this charge, the tongs were heated. Farha had placed the hot tongs on the victim’s right arm for a few seconds. The act was callous and demeaning. Because the tongs was hot, I agreed with the DPP’s submission that the pain suffered was elevated and it also increased the psychological trauma. As such, I was of the view that the sentence should fall on the upper end of the range ie six months’ imprisonment.

109    For the remaining three charges- the 3rd, 4th and 6th charges - I found that they fell into the “less serious physical harm and more serious psychological harm” category. The indicative sentencing range for this category was six to 12 months’ imprisonment.

110    In relation to the 3rd and 4th charges, a shower head and broomstick were used to assault the victim. The assaults were sustained and demeaning. In the 3rd charge, Farha had preceded the physical abuse with verbal abuse when she scolded the victim in a derogatory manner saying, “_why are you asking me this? Who are you in this house?_”. The attack had caused visible bruises over her left arm which persisted for several days (see Exhibit P45). The fact that the attack had been inflicted in the small confines of the bathroom would have elevated the level of the victim’s trauma. The persistent nature of the assaults and excessive violence employed were not consistent with a spontaneous or momentary loss of self-control. Instead it was a vivid demonstration of cruelty by Farha.

111    For these reasons, the sentences should be pushed upwards from the lowest end of the range. In my view, a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment was warranted for the 3rd charge, while a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment was warranted for the 4th charge. The one month difference was to account for the more elevated level of trauma of the victim in being assaulted within the small confined space of the bathroom.

112    I agreed with the submission of DPP Johannus that the 6th charge represented the worst of the abuses. The victim suffered a rapid fire series of abuses within a short span of time. This charge together with the 8th charge (criminal intimidation) was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back for the victim. The victim was so traumatised and in fear for her life that she took the huge risk of climbing over the living room window onto the ledge in order to make her escape. This action was clear evidence of the high degree of psychological harm inflicted on her. I was of the view that the appropriate sentence should be closer to the upper end of the sentencing range ie, ten months’ imprisonment.

113    In relation to the 8th charge (criminal intimidation), I followed the guidelines set out in _Tan Kay Beng v PP_[^72]. The nature of the threat, the context in which the threat was uttered, and the effect it has on the victim were the most significant factors for sentencing. The custody threshold could be expected if the threat was committed in the course of an assault or other criminal conduct. If the threat had caused the victim to fear for his or her safety, that was an additional aggravating factor. Where the threat was to kill but without a weapon, then the sentencing range for a first offender was between six to 12 months’ imprisonment.

114    In the present case, the threat was made at the end of a series of what constituted a prolonged and brutal assault on the victim. The fact that Farha had pointed to the toy stick that she had used to assault the victim earlier when she uttered the threat underscored the point that she was serious, and that the victim should contemplate a severe beating with the stick if she did not complete her chores by the time Farha and her family returned to the flat. Farha’s words immediately after that about telling people that the victim had jumped off the flat because she was mad was a veiled threat at the victim’s life. It was not surprising that the victim had been psychologically terrorised. This explained her pell-mell exit from the flat. For these reasons, I agreed with DPP Johannus that a sentence of at least three months was appropriate.

#### The charges against Tasleem

115    I was of the view that the two charges against Tasleem fell into the “less serious physical harm and less serious psychological harm” category. With regard to psychological harm, apart from the attendant distress felt because of the pain from the assaults, there was very little psychological harm caused by Tasleem. In relation to the degree of physical harm, I agreed with DPP Johannus that the assault in the 2nd charge was more egregious than in the 1st charge. In the 2nd charge, Tasleem had kicked her twice on her lower back at the waist, whereas in the 1st charge, the assault comprised punching the face. The lower back constituted a vulnerable part of the body given that was where the lumbar area of the spine was located. As such, the sentence for the 2nd charge should be higher than the sentence for the 1st charge.

116    I accepted that the two assaults were committed in a pique of anger because of what Tasleem perceived to be the victim’s ineptness in carrying out her chores. As such, I accepted that there was a lack of premeditation. However, Tasleem had, in the course of the trial, attempted to cover up his and Farha’s crimes by trying to suborn the victim. This was a clear lack of remorse on his part. It was also an aggravating factor.

117    All considered, I was of the view that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment for the 1st charge and four months’ imprisonment for the 2nd charge were appropriate.

119    The sentences in MAC 900959-18, MAC 900962-18, and MAC 900964-18 were ordered to run consecutively. The total aggregate sentence was 21 months’ imprisonment. In making this order, I applied the totality principle set out in _Shouffee_. In my view, three sentences should run consecutively to reflect the persistent nature and the intensity of the acts of abuse. I should highlight here that the abhorrent manner in which Farha had conducted her defence was also factored into the equation. She had made demeaning aspersions on the victim’s hygiene, saying that the victim had smelt of cow dung. She had also accused the victim of ill-treating and hurting her younger son by banging his head against the wall. The icing on the cake was her assertion that it was not at all dangerous for the victim to be on the ledge outside her flat, callously claiming that she would have been comfortable sitting on the ledge. Therefore all considered, the total aggregate sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment was not disproportionate.

120    I did not give significant weight to Farha’s psychiatric condition. Firstly, there was no causal or contributory link between her condition and the offences. Secondly, other than the stress from caring for Ashir, the other stressors had stemmed from factors post-offence ie, her father’s passing, marital strain and worry over the case against her. It was also significant that despite her claim that she had suffered from low mood and stress during the period of the offences, she had not sought psychiatric help or treatment until after the commission of the offences. She herself had said that she saw Dr Leong for psychiatric help after her father’s death. The medication prescribed to her and which she took was for migraine, not for low mood and stress. Her conduct and behaviour during the material time also suggested that she was not suffering from major depressive disorder. She was engaged in activities such as fitness classes and studying for her Project Management Professional certification.

121    The sentences in relation to Tasleem were as follows –

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="43.48%"> <col width="56.52%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">MCN 900632-18</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Three months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">MCN 900633-18</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Four months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

122    The two sentences were ordered to run concurrently, making the aggregate sentence four months’ imprisonment. Similarly, in making this order, I had applied the principles in _Shouffee_. Notwithstanding that the offences constituted distinct offences, there was none of the pattern of sustained and cruel abuses seen in Farha’s case. Although his conduct in attempting to suborn the victim was serious and constituted an additional aggravating factor, overall, the degree of harm and culpability in Tasleem’s case was still far lower than Farha’s.

## Compensation Order

123    I ordered that Farha make compensation payment of $4,500/- to the victim pursuant to s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68. I also ordered that Tasleem make compensation payment of $1,000/- to the victim pursuant to the same Code.

124    I applied the principles set out in _Tay Wee Kiat and anor v PP and anor[^73]_ (“_Tay Wee Kiat No. 2_”). In that case, the heads of damage in ordering compensation in a maid abuse case were - (i) pain and suffering caused to the victim; (ii) medical expenses incurred by the victim; (iii) loss or damage to the victim’s property as a result of the offence; and (iv) prospective earnings ie income the victim would have earned but for her being unemployed pending the investigation and trial.

125    DPP Johannus sought for compensation for “pain and suffering” caused to the victim. Under this head of damage, the court in _Tay Wee Kiat No 2_ (at \[19\]) followed the Guidelines for the Assessment of Damages in Personal Injury Cases[^74]. In the Guidelines, a single abrasion or contusion was pegged at $500. For multiple contusions on any part of the body, the starting award was $500 to $1,000. Applying these guidelines, DPP Johannus submitted for a sum of $500 for each charge under s 323 read with s 73(2) PC against the two accused persons. Mr Fernando did not make any submissions on compensation. Having considered the matter, I accepted DPP Johannus’s submission. As such I ordered that Farha pay compensation to the victim of $4,500 in default nine days’ imprisonment, and Tasleem pay compensation to the victim of $1,000 in default two days’ imprisonment

## Conclusion

126    In conclusion, Farha’s total aggregate sentence was 21 months’ imprisonment. In addition, she was to pay the victim compensation of $4,500 in default nine days’ imprisonment. Tasleem’s total aggregate sentence was four months’ imprisonment, He was to pay the victim compensation of $1,000 in default two days’ imprisonment.

127    The accused persons have appealed against conviction and sentence. They are currently on bail pending appeal.
