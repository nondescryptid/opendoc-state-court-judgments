Criminal Law – Statutory offences – Misuse of Drugs Act

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9870/2020/1.\]

19 November 2020

### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

1       The Accused claimed trial to a single charge of enhanced trafficking, as set out below:

> “You… are charged that you, on 12 September 2018, at or about 8.15 a.m., at Blk 255 Balestier Road #1-03 Fragrance Hotel – Balestier, Singapore 329710, together with one Nurul Shahida Binte Mohamed Razhik …, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did jointly traffic in a “Class A” controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, by having in your possession for the purpose of traficking one packet and six straws containing not less than 11.72 grams of granular/powdery substance which was pulverised and homogenised into a powdery substance, and analysed and found to contain not less than 0.12 gram of diamorphine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby comitted an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed),

> and further, that you,

> prior to the commission of the aforesaid offence, were on 3 October 2013 in District Court No. 12, Singapore, _vide_ DAC7239/2013, convicted of an offence of trafficking in a controlled drug, _to wit_, Methamphetamine, under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under section 33(4A)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted the Accused accordingly.

3       He is now appealing against this conviction.

## Prosecution’s Case

4       The Accused was arrested on 12 September 2018 in Room 103 of Fragrance Hotel Balestier for an offence of drug consumption[^1]. After the arrest, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) led by PW1 ASP Tan Teo Hai (“PW1 ASP Tan”) conducted a search on the hotel room and recovered several exhibits, including the following:

> (i)     One packet containing granular substances (later marked “FH-D1A”);

> (ii)     One packet containing six straws of granular substances (later marked “FH-D1B”);

> (iii)     Numerous empty packets, labelling stickers and mini envelopes; and

> (iv)     One weighing scale (marked “FH-G1”)

5       The drug exhibits FH-D1A and FH-D1B were found on the bed.

6       One Nurul Shahida Binte Mohamed Razhik (“PW 21 Nurul”) was also arrested together with the Accused in Room 103.

7       After the arrest and search, PW1 ASP Tan recorded a contemporaneous statement from the Accused at about 9.30 a.m[^2]. This took place on the balcony of the hotel room.

8       The Accused was subsequently brought to his motorbike for a search, and then back to his official residence at Blk 978 Jurong West Street 93, #XXX, Singapore 640978 for a house raid. Nothing incriminating was found in both searches. The Accused was then brought back to Tanglin Police Division to be processed.

9       Back at Tanglin Police Division, the Accused’s urine specimen was procured and an Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) was conducted on a portion of the urine specimen. The result was positive for Amphetamine[^3].

10     Following from this, a statement under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”) was recorded from the Accused on 12 September 2018 at about 4 p.m[^4], and another one on 13 September 2018 at about 1 a.m[^5].

### Chain of possession of the relevant drug exhibits

11     The drug exhibits (later marked FH-D1A and FH-D1B) were seized by PW2 Staff Sergeant Muhammad Azri bin Abu Bakar (“PW2 SSgt Azri”) in the course of the search of Room 103 of Fragrance Hotel. They were contained in a black pouch bag, which was found on the bed. At the point when PW2 SSgt Azri seized the drug exhibits, the Accused was beside him. PW2 SSgt Azri asked the Accused who the drugs belonged to, and the Accused answered that “all the drugs belongs to him”, and that they contained heroin.[^6] Upon seizing the exhibits, PW2 SSgt Azri held on to them in an Ops bag until he arrived back at Tanglin Division. The exhibits were sealed in a polymer bag and kept in his locked drawer. At about 9 plus p.m. that same day, PW2 brought the exhibits to CNB Headquarters (“HQ”) at Police Cantonment Complex, and handed the exhibits over to PW11 Edmund Ong (“PW11 IO Edmund”), who was the investigation officer (“IO”) in charge at that point.

12     Both PW2 SSgt Azri and PW11 IO Edmund gave evidence of the handing over process, which would involve both of them going through the list of exhibits and ensuring that the exhibits tallied with what was stated in the arrest report and had not been tampered with. PW11 IO Edmund would physically check the exhibits, even cutting open the sealed bags if necessary to ascertain the quantity of exhibits within. After he ensured that everything was in order, he officially took over custody of the exhibits.

13     PW11 IO Edmund and PW2 SSgt Azri also confirmed that the exhibits marked “D1A” and “D1A1” in the arrest report were later collectively marked as FH-D1A, and the exhibits marked “D1B” and “D1B1” in the arrest report were later collectively marked FH-D1B. PW11 IO Edmund explained that he had made some changes to the marking when he was taking photographs of the exhibits, although he could not recall exactly why he did it. He confirmed that it was up to the IO to decide on the eventual marking.

14     After taking over custody of the exhibits, PW11 IO Edmund proceeded to take photographs of the exhibits (as reflected in P7), after which he kept the exhibits in his locked personal cabinet. The next day (13 September 2018), he handed over the exhibits to the CNB Exhibit Management Team (“EMT”) at about 11.15 a.m. The EMT officer who took over the exhibits from PW11 IO Edmund Ong was PW15 SSSgt Chang Tat Tien (“PW15 SSSgt Chang”).

15     PW15 SSSgt Chang also gave evidence on the process for taking over, which would involve him checking the exhibits against the submission form prepared by the IO. The form would contain the marking and description of the exhibits. Once these were in order, the exhibits would be sealed in polymer bags and signed by both PW15 SSSgt Chang and PW11 IO Edmund. After taking over the exhibits, PW15 SSSgt Chang kept them in a locked cupboard in the EMT office. On the same day at about 3.13 p.m., he brought the exhibits FH-D1A and FH-D1B to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) and handed them over to a staff in HSA. The HSA staff would check that the exhibits were in order and tallied with the descriptions in the form before they accepted the exhibits.

16     PW16 Goh Jia Hui Karen, an analyst working in the Illicit Drugs Laboratory, HSA at the relevant time confirmed that she had received the exhibits marked FH-D1A and FH-D1B on 13 September 2018 at about 3.13 p.m. She subsequently handed them over to analyst PW17 Lee Yan Kai on 1 October 2018. The exhibits were then analysed by PW17 Lee Yan Kai and PW 18 Rachael Lim Su Yun, and confirmed to be the following:

> (i)     Exhibit marked “FH-D1A” was found to be 7.46 grams of granular substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.07 gram of diamorphine; and

> (ii)     Exhibit marked “FH-D1B” was found to be 4.26 grams of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.05 gram of diamorphine.

17     The relevant HSA certificates issued by PW17 Lee Yan Kai were admitted and marked P8 and P9.

### Urine procurement and test

18     Evidence was also led by the Prosecution on the urine procurement process and the Accused’s urine test results.

19     PW9 Toh Zong Jun (“PW9 Toh”) gave evidence that he assisted to procure the Accused’s urine on 12 September 2018. PW10 SSgt Muhamad Suffian Bin Salleh (“PW10 SSgt Suffian”) gave evidence that he was the IUT operator at the material time, and was the one who had printed out the IUT results slip[^7]. He was also the sealing officer who had instructed the Accused to sign on the HSA labels which were later affixed on the two bottles containing the Accused’s urine sample, and deposit them into a metal box which would later be sent to the HSA for analysis. PW10 SSgt Suffian also explained that although the IUT results for the Accused’s urine sample only tested positive for Amphetamine, he had sealed the urine sample for both Amphetamine and Opiates, and this would have been under the instructions from the IO in charge. PW10 SSgt Suffian also confirmed that the Accused was present throughout the sealing process.

20     PW24 Sgt Zakaria Bin Zainal gave evidence that he was the officer who submitted the box containing the Accused’s urine samples to HSA on 13 September 2018.

21     The two HSA analysts, PW25 Siti Aisyah Binte Jamil (“PW25 Siti”) and PW26 Maggie Tiong Su Su (“PW26 Maggie”) gave evidence that they had analysed the Accused’s urine samples, which were found to contain Methamphetamine. The two HSA certificates bearing Lab No. AT-1833-08952-001-03 and AT-1833-08952-002-03 were admitted and marked P15 and P16 respectively. Both analysts confirmed that this result was consistent with the consumption of Methamphetamine.

22     Both analysts also confirmed that the Accused’s urine was tested for Opiates[^8] but found to be negative. PW25 Siti gave evidence that she got a reading of 94 ng/ml of opiates when the initial test was carried out, while PW26 Maggie gave evidence that she got a reading of 16 ng/ml. The international criteria for a positive reading of Opiates was 300 ng/ml. The Accused’s urine was also screened for monoacetymorphine. PW25 Siti gave evidence that she found a concentration of zero for monacetylmorphine, while PW26 Maggie gave evidence that she found a concentration of minus 1.6 ng/ml.

23     According to PW25 Siti, the detection period for diamorphine in a urine sample was about 1 – 3 days.

### Evidence from the co-accused

24     PW21 Nurul was the co-accused named in the charge. She pleaded guilty on 20 June 2019 to a similar charge of being in possession of the said drug exhibits for the purpose of trafficking, and in furtherance of the common intention between her and the Accused[^9]. In the Statement of Facts that she pleaded guilty to, PW21 Nurul admitted that the drug exhibits belonged to the Accused, but that she would help him sell them with his knowledge and consent, at $20 for a straw. She knew they contained diamorphine.

25     Her evidence in court was that the Accused was a “companion” whom she met a few months before the arrest, and whom she would meet up with about three to four times a week. They consumed Methamphetamine together. PW21 Nurul admitted that she was the one who passed the diamorphine to the Accused, but the drugs belonged to the both of them. The Accused had given her $300 to purchase three packets of diamorphine, which was later repacked, the remainder of which formed the seized drugs exhibits at FH-D1A and FH-D1B[^10]. She confirmed that she and the Accused had intended to sell the drug exhibits[^11]. She also confirmed that she had never seen the Accused consuming diamorphine, and that she did not consume diamorphine herself.

### Statements from the Accused

#### First ancillary hearing (three statements recorded on 12 and 13 September 2018)

26     As the Accused objected to the admissibility of his statements on two different grounds, two separate ancillary hearings were conducted.

27     With regard to the contemporaneous statement recorded on 12 September 2018 at about 9.30 a.m. and the s 22 CPC statements recorded on 12 September 2018 at 4 p.m. and 13 September 2018 at 1 a.m., the Accused claimed that he was intoxicated and did not know or remember the answers which he gave for those statements. He mainly relied on the positive IUT result to show that he was intoxicated. In addition, the Accused also tendered his educational documents[^12] to prove that, contrary to what was indicated in his statements, he was not a Secondary Two drop-out. According to him, this showed that he was not giving answers properly in the statements.

28     The Prosecution called the three recorders of the statements to give evidence, as well as all the arresting and escorting officers who had contact with the Accused throughout his arrest and up until his third statement was recorded.

29     The three recorders of the statements were PW1 ASP Tan, PW8 Sgt Muhammad Firdaus Bin Salleh (“PW8 Sgt Firdaus”) and PW11 IO Edmund. All three of them confirmed that there was nothing remarkable about the recording process, and that the Accused’s demeanour was normal and he could understand and respond to their questions. All three of them also gave evidence that the Accused did not show any signs of intoxication or drug withdrawal at the time of the recording, and that they would not have proceeded to record the statements if they had observed any such signs in him. In fact, PW11 IO Edmund testified that prior to the recording of the third statement, he had asked both the Accused and PW21 Nurul if they were feeling alright or sleepy. The Accused had replied that he was alert as he had managed to sleep for a few hours in the lock up prior to this[^13]. PW21 Nurul replied that she was feeling sleepy. As such, PW11 IO Edmund discarded his initial plan to record a statement from PW21 Nurul, and instead went to record a statement from the Accused.

30     PW8 Sgt Firdaus also gave evidence that throughout the recording of the second statement, he would check in with the Accused regularly on whether he was okay and whether he needed a toilet break.

31     All three recorders confirmed that the contents of the statements had been given voluntarily by the Accused.

32     Evidence from the other arresting officers was consistent with the observations by the recording officers, in that none of them observed any signs of intoxication or drug withdrawal in the Accused. He could walk steadily and unaided, and he could respond to questions and comply with instructions. In short, he appeared “normal” to all of them.

33     Evidence was also led from these officers about the many processes which the Accused had to go through from the time of his arrest to the time his third statement was recorded, including:

> (a)     leading the officers to his motorbike which was parked at the basement car park of the nearby Rocca Balestier building;

> (b)     guiding the officers to his official residence for a home raid;

> (c)     answering questions on the DNA consent form and giving his blood sample;

> (d)     confirming his particulars for the purpose of the IUT;

> (e)     complying with instructions to provide his urine specimen, which involved choosing the bottles, and transferring his urine specimen from the master bottle to the two sample bottles;

> (f)     complying with instructions to deposit his two urine sample bottles in the correct hole in the metal security box; and

> (g)     complying with instructions for a strip search, involving having to take off his clothing in a particular order, squatting, and later wearing back his own clothes himself.

34     The evidence from the arresting and escorting officers was that the Accused had no problems doing the above, and exhibited no signs of intoxication or drug withdrawal throughout the process.

#### Court’s decision on first ancillary hearing

35     I noted that the three statements were recorded by three separate recorders from the Accused over a course of about 16 hours. There was no reason to disbelieve the evidence from the recorders and other arresting and escorting officers that the Accused’s demeanour throughout this 16 hours was unremarkable, and that he exhibited no apparent signs of intoxication or drug withdrawal. It was very difficult to see how the procedures listed at \[33\] above could have been completed if the Accused had been in such a state of intoxication that he could not respond properly to questions or instructions.

36     I further noted that the contents of the statements themselves were internally coherent and consistent, and certainly not like the ramblings of someone not in control of his own mind. The Accused had also neatly written down his NRIC and signed on every page of the statements. Although he claimed not to recall anything of the process, the Accused did not disagree that the handwriting and signatures on the documents were his.

37     The Accused pointed out that the educational level provided in the statement was wrong, and that while the contemporaneous statement stated that he sold one packet of “Panas” for $100, the second statement stated that he had sold one bag of “Panas” for $140. However, I did not think that the inconsistencies pointed out by the Accused in the statements were significant at all, and certainly not to an extent to detract from the voluntariness of the statements.

38     The IUT results alone, being simply a preliminary test for the presence of drugs in the urine, was not sufficient to show that the Accused was intoxicated. Other than this, what the Accused had left was simply a bare assertion of intoxication. Considering that against the weight of the evidence from all the prosecution witnesses, and the coherent, detailed and signed statements, I was satisfied that the first three statements were recorded voluntarily and admitted them into evidence accordingly.

#### Second ancillary hearing

39     The Accused also challenged the admissibility of a fourth statement recorded from him on 8 October 2018. This statement was recorded by PW11 IO Edmund at Changi Prison Cluster B3. The main ground of challenge appeared to be that the statement had been made on the basis of an inducement/promise.

40     According to the Accused, when PW11 IO Edmund came to see him that day, he informed the Accused that he had to “speed up this interview”[^14] because he needed to record a statement from the co-accused afterwards. PW11 IO Edmund then showed the Accused the charges against him, and the Accused disagreed with the trafficking charge. They had a “disagreement” and PW11 IO Edmund then told him that he was unable to do anything because of the previous statements. PW11 IO Edmund then told the Accused not to worry as his case was still undergoing investigation. If the analysis from the HSA came back with the results below the trafficking limit, then he would “drop” the charges against the Accused to possession.[^15] The Accused believed this, and decided to give the statement. The Accused agreed that he had signed on the statement.

41     PW11 IO Edmund denied making any such statements or promises to the Accused, and confirmed that the statement was given by the Accused voluntarily. He also explained that the purpose of this further statement was to establish the _modus operandi_ on how the Accused transacted and obtained his drugs, with a view to further investigation upstream on his suppliers. PW11 IO Edmund also gave evidence that the Accused’s previous statements were read back to him prior to the recording of this fourth statement.

#### Court’s decision on second ancillary hearing

42     There was no reason for me to disbelieve PW11 IO Edmund’s evidence. The Accused had already given detailed confessions in three earlier statements, and there was no logical reason why PW11 IO Edmund needed to resort to any promises or undue influence to get him to give another positive statement.

43     In any case, even if I accepted that PW11 IO Edmund had said what he was alleged to have said to the Accused, I was unable to see how this translated into a promise that made the Accused give this statement. Indeed, if the Accused had been unhappy with the trafficking charge and was only convinced to give this statement on PW1 IO Edmund’s promise that the charge might be reduced, it did not make sense for him to then go ahead and give a false statement about drug transactions. The Accused’s claim was therefore inherently incoherent.

44     Given the above, I did not accept that any promises were made to the Accused, but even if there were, it was not such a promise as to render the statement involuntary. I was satisfied that the statement was given by the Accused voluntarily and admitted it accordingly.

#### Contents of the Accused’s statements

45     In the Accused’s first statement recorded on 12 September 2018 at 9.30 a.m[^16]., he stated the following:

> (a)     The exhibits found and seized from the room were “Panas” and “Sejuk”.

> (b)     All the “Panas” and “Sejuk” belonged to him, except for the “Sejuk” found in the safe, which belonged to PW21 Nurul.

> (c)     The “Sejuk” was meant for consumption and selling. The “Panas” was only meant for selling, as he did not smoke “Panas”.

> (d)     He sold one set of “Sejuk” (5g) for $200 - $250, and one packet of “Panas” (8g) for $100.

> (e)     He started selling “Sejuk” about one month ago, but only just started selling “Panas”.

46     In the Accused’s second statement recorded on 12 September 2018 at 4.00 p.m[^17]., he stated the following:

> (a)     Exhibits “D1A1” and “D1B1”[^18] were the remains of heroin which PW21 Nurul bought. There were initially three bags like “D1A1” but the rest had been sold off. The Accused had packed half of a bag into straws, and another bag into packets. He sold about two or three straws for about $20 each, half a bag for $100 and one bag for $140.

> (b)     PW21 Nurul was a friend of his with whom he was in an open relationship. He had known her since June 2018 and they smoked “ice” in hotel rooms once in a while. Apart from “ice”, he did not consume any other controlled drugs.

> (c)     The reason he sold “ice” was so that he would have money to cover his drug taking habits.

47     In the Accused’s third statement recorded on 13 September 2018 at 1 a.m[^19]., he was shown photographs of the seized exhibits and confirmed the following:

> (a)     With regard to the photograph of the exhibit marked “FH-D1A”, he explained that the exhibit was bought by PW21 Nurul. She had bought three similar packets and together, they sold one and a half packets. The photograph showed what was left. They sold to friends. They intended to sell the remaining, but had not found any clients yet. In relation to this exhibit, the Accused also reiterated that he did not consume “P”.

> (b)     With regard to the photograph of the exhibit marked “FH-D1B”, he explained that the exhibit was the remainder of the half packet which PW21 Nurul and him had sold. They had the intention to sell this too, but had not found any clients yet.

48     In the Accused’s fourth statement recorded on 8 October 2018 at 10.08 a.m[^20]., he stated the following:

> (a)     He usually sold “ice” and only recently started selling “heroin”. He planned to sell “heroin” at $15 to $20 for one straw. He did not weigh the “heroin”.

> (b)     His clients would normally contact him via Whatsapp to buy drugs, and he only sold to people he knew.

> (c)     Usually PW21 Nurul was the one who would buy the “heroin” in bulk and he would repack it into straws for selling.

49     The Accused’s memorandum of certified previous convictions was also tendered[^21], confirming that on 3 October 2013, he had been convicted for one count of trafficking (Methamphetamine) under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA and sentenced to a term of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane.

50     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, I found that there was a prima facie case made out against the Accused and called for the defence accordingly.

## The Defence Case

51     The Accused chose to give evidence on his own behalf, and did not call any other witnesses.

52     The Accused admitted to the ownership and possession of the seized drugs (FH-D1A and FH-D1B) and knew that they contained diamorphine[^22]. However, he maintained that they were meant for his own consumption. He explained that PW21 Nurul had never seen him consume diamorphine because he did not want her to become “involved”[^23] in diamorphine. His evidence was that on the day of the arrest, he had consumed Methamphetamine.

53     In cross examination, the Accused agreed that both he and PW21 Nurul were heavy users of Methamphetamine. The Accused was not staying at his official place of residence at the material time, and he would stay at various locations during the period, including hotels and friends’ houses. The Accused was not earning a salary since July 2018. However, he maintained that his lifestyle was still affordable, and denied that he was funding his hotel stays with the money he made from selling drugs.

54     The Accused admitted that he had given $300 to PW21 Nurul so that she could help him purchase diamorphine, although he was not sure how many packets she would buy as she would usually buy different types of drugs at the same time. He also claimed that he did not count the packets when she handed them over to him. In cross examination, he stated that it was PW21 Nurul who offered to buy heroin for him from her supplier. However, he also admitted that she did not consume diamorphine, and had never seen him do so as well. When asked why PW21 Nurul would offer to buy diamorphine for him, the Accused’s response was that perhaps PW21 Nurul had seen that he was “craving”[^24] for diamorphine. PW21 Nurul had consumed diamorphine in the past, and would know the signs.

## Court’s Findings

### Chain of custody of the relevant drugs established

55     In the course of closing submissions, the Accused raised an issue of certain discrepancies in the listing of the seized exhibits in the contemporaneous statement marked P3, and the arrest report marked P1. In particular, the exhibit referred to as “B2B1” in the contemporaneous statement P3 was described as one packet of crystallised substance, while the same exhibit referred to as “D1B1” in the arrest report P1 was described as two packets of crystallised substance. On this basis, the Accused contended that there was some doubt as to the integrity of the seized exhibits as a whole. The Prosecution’s response was that (a) the discrepancies did not relate to the diamorphine exhibits, (b) P3, being a contemporaneous statement, was never meant to be taken as authoritative list of exhibits which were seized and it was P1 which the court should have reference to, (c) the accuracy of the descriptions in P1 was confirmed by the photographs annexed to the statement marked P5 and (d) the other evidence pointed to no break in the chain of custody of the seized exhibits.

56     I agreed broadly with the Prosecution’s arguments. The discrepancy highlighted by the Accused was a minor one in the face of all the other evidence pertaining to the seized exhibits and how they were handled. PW1 ASP Tan was the best person to have been confronted about this discrepancy, but unfortunately that was not done. Presumably this was because the Accused only discovered this discrepancy in the course of preparing closing submissions. Being unrepresented, I did not think the failure to confront PW1 ASP Tan should be taken against the Accused, but the fact is that the purpose of P3 was not to put the seizure of exhibits on record. There is good reason why the practice is for this to be properly put into an arrest report (P1) _after_ the scene of crime had been processed, and when the relevant officer has the time and space to properly account for everything. In addition, the evidence from PW2 SSgt Azri was that he had kept all the seized exhibits with him, until the time he handed them over to PW11 IO Edmund. Everything was properly documented and his evidence as well as the evidence from the other witnesses who came into contact with the relevant drug exhibits thereafter was clear and unimpeachable.

57     At trial, the Accused also raised an issue regarding the change in the marking of the drug exhibits. Although the marking of the exhibits had changed slightly, this did not affect the fact that these were the same exhibits which were seized and subsequently sent to HSA for analysis. The evidence from PW2 SSgt Azri and PW11 IO Edmund established this. PW2 SSgt Azri was the officer who first seized the exhibits, and he identified them in the photographs admitted and marked P7[^25]. PW11 IO Edmund confirmed that he had taken photographs of the exhibits he took over from PW2 SSgt Azri, as reflected in P7 and that the same exhibits were later handed over to the CNB EMT.

58     Pertinently, as also pointed out by the Prosecution, the Accused himself did not dispute at trial that the exhibits FH-D1A and FH-D1B belonged to him and were the same exhibits seized from him. In addition, PW21 Nurul was shown the photographs of FH-D1A and FH-D1B and confirmed that those were the same drug exhibits which were seized.

59     I was therefore satisfied that the chain of custody for the drug exhibits was established and unbroken, and that the drug exhibits marked FH-D1A and FH-D1B, which were found to contain not less than 0.12 gram of diamorphine, were the same drug exhibits which were seized from the hotel room, and which the Accused admitted were in his possession and belonged to him.

60     The key issue in contention is the purpose for which the Accused was in possession of the said drug exhibits. The Prosecution’s case was that the Accused was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The Accused claimed that he was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of consumption.

61     Having considered the evidence tendered at trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drug exhibits were in the possession of the Accused, for the purpose of trafficking.

### Accused had admitted in four separate statements that he intended to sell the drugs

62     I attached full weight to the four statements recorded from the Accused, because I found no basis to do otherwise. The statements were recorded by three separate recorders, and were internally and externally consistent and coherent. I found the recorders to be credible witnesses, and accepted their evidence that the statements were recorded according to procedure and read back for the Accused for him to be able to make any amendments he wanted. I also accepted that the statements were signed by the Accused.

63     I found that the statements were recorded from the Accused voluntarily, and for the reasons set out at \[35\] to \[38\] above, I did not accept the Accused’s account that he had been intoxicated in the course of recording the first three statements. I note that the Accused had not sought to provide another explanation for why he had said what he said in those statements. Three of the statements were recorded in the English language and in the course of the trial, it was clear to me that the Accused could understand and speak English quite well. There was therefore also no basis to find that there might have been any miscommunication or inaccuracy in the recording of these statements.

64     The statements given by the Accused consistently maintained that he did not consume heroin, and that the said drug exhibits found in his possession were for sale.

65     The contents of the Accused’s statements were also externally consistent with the exhibits found and the form they were found in – drug exhibits repacked into straws, numerous empty packets and a weighing machine. While these items by themselves are not conclusive of trafficking, they certainly provide some form of corroboration for the Accused’s confessions in his statements that he was selling heroin, since these are the paraphernalia associated with selling drugs.

66     The Accused’s statements were also corroborated by the evidence of PW21 Nurul, who confirmed that the drug exhibits were meant for sale and that she had helped the Accused sell heroin before. PW21 Nurul also confirmed that she had never seen the Accused consume heroin. There was no reason to disbelieve PW21 Nurul, or to think that she would want to falsely implicate the Accused. She had already pleaded guilty to a similar trafficking (read with common intention) charge, and whether or not she implicated the Accused would not make a difference to her. Having assessed her demeanour in court, I was satisfied that she was telling the truth.

67     Another circumstance brought to my attention and which I thought corroborated the Accused’s confessions, was the fact that he was unemployed since July 2018. It was quite implausible that he would have money to sustain his lifestyle of drugs and the frequent hotel stays for more than two months, if he did not have a source of income. There was no evidence that he had any other source of income. The only reasonable explanation for how he managed to sustain this lifestyle was found in the statements – he used the profits from his drug sales to fund his lifestyle.[^26]

68     Therefore, apart from the fact that the statements themselves were coherent and internally consistent, there was also external corroboration by other evidence.

### Accused’s explanation for how he came by the diamorphine was not satisfactory

69     I wasn’t satisfied with the Accused’s account of how he got PW21 Nurul to buy the diamorphine. He was evasive about the amount of diamorphine he was looking to buy, and claimed that he did not know[^27]. His evidence was that when PW21 Nurul passed him the drugs, he did not count the packets.[^28] The Accused had given $300 to PW21 Nurul for the purchase, and he must have known how much drugs he was supposed to get. $300 was not a small sum of money, and it was not believable for the Accused to have simply handed over this sum of money in such a careless manner. This was particularly so given that the Accused was unemployed at the material time and not earning any income at all.

70     In addition, there were also many inherent difficulties with his account of PW21 Nurul being the one who offered to buy diamorphine for him. First, this does not sit well with the evidence that PW21 Nurul had never seen him consume diamorphine before. If she had never seen him consume diamorphine before, and they did not sell diamorphine, why would she even ask him if he wanted to buy diamorphine? PW21 Nurul’s evidence, which the Accused did not dispute, was also that this was not the first time she had bought diamorphine for the Accused. The Accused’s explanation that PW21 Nurul might have seen him craving for heroin also does not sit well with her not knowing that the Accused was consuming diamorphine. Why would she not assume he was simply craving Methamphetamine? The undisputed evidence is that PW21 Nurul had never seen the Accused consume diamorphine and did not know that the Accused was consuming diamorphine. That being the case, the only other possibility that PW21 Nurul would offer to buy diamorphine for the Accused or to agree to buy diamorphine for the Accused, would be because they were planning to sell the diamorphine.

71     In addition, the Accused’s evidence that he never consumed diamorphine in front of PW21 Nurul because he did not want her to get involved with diamorphine, was at odds with his account of asking her to go and buy the diamorphine for him. There was also no logical reason why the Accused needed to shield PW21 Nurul from diamorphine, given that they were both consuming another Class A controlled drug (Methamphetamine) together, and he knew that PW21 Nurul had previously been convicted for consuming diamorphine. I also note that the diamorphine drug exhibits were openly found on the bed of the hotel room, and not locked away from PW21 Nurul. PW21 Nurul’s evidence was that she had free access to these drug exhibits.[^29] This was not disputed by the Accused.[^30]

72     There were too many inherent inconsistencies and difficulties with the Accused’s account for it to be believable. The Accused had clearly tied himself in knots in trying to explain away how he came to get PW21 Nurul to buy diamorphine for him, when she was not supposed to have known that he consumed the drugs. The only reasonable explanation was that the diamorphine had been bought for sale, and both PW21 Nurul and the Accused knew that.

### Accused’s consumption claims are an afterthought, not borne out by HSA test results

73     The urine test results further support the evidence that the Accused did not consume diamorphine. His urine specimen tested negative for opiates or monoacetylmorphine. While it was possible that any traces of diamorphine in his urine might not be detected after a few days of consumption, the Accused tellingly did not give any evidence as to when was the last time he consumed diamorphine.

74     The negative urine results also indicate that at the very least, the Accused could not have been consuming diamorphine to such a degree that he had to purchase such large amounts of the drugs, or that he would suffer from such severe withdrawal effects for PW21 Nurul to have deduced that he was craving diamorphine.

75     Apart from a bare assertion, there was simply no other evidence to support the Accused’s claim that he had consumed diamorphine. In fact, the evidence seems to indicate otherwise.

76     Finally, I also note that the Accused never mentioned that he had consumed diamorphine in his statements, even in his 4th statement recorded about a month after his arrest. There was no good reason why he would not have mentioned this in his statements if that was the truth, since he would have known that that would have provided him with a defence for the enhanced trafficking charge. The Accused was also aware of the sentence for an enhanced trafficking charge, and would presumably have been eager to get out of it if he could. The irresistible inference was therefore that the Accused’s consumption defence was simply an afterthought.

## Conclusion

77     Based on the above, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the charge against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt, and convicted him accordingly.

78     The Accused has not appealed against his sentence, but for completeness, I will state that after conviction, the Accused pleaded guilty to three other charges, and was sentenced as follows:

79     Five other drug related charges were taken into consideration. The sentences for DAC 930710/2018 and DAC 900302/2019 were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 10 years’ and 8 months’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. The term of imprisonment was ordered to commence from 13 September 2018.
