\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9773/2020/01.\]

1 September 2020

### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to one charge of consuming methamphetamine. Positive urine test results were visited upon her and occasioned by sipping from a drink placed by her husband in their home freezer. Essentially, she raised the spiking defence.

2       All things considered, the presumption under s 22 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) was invoked, and the Accused had not rebutted the presumption on a balance of probabilities. The Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. She was convicted and sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment.

3       The Accused has appealed against conviction and sentence, and the sentence has been stayed pending appeal. I set out my reasons.

## Charge

4       The Accused faced one charge under s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA:

> You, SURIANNY BINTE SULAIMAN are charged that you, on or before 26 December 2018, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, Methamphetamine, without authorization under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the said Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and you shall be punished under Section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev. Ed).

## Statement of agreed facts

5       The Accused is Surianny Binte Sulaiman, a 38-year-old female Singapore Citizen.

6       On 26 December 2018, the Accused provided a sample of her urine. Her urine sample was transferred into two bottles. She was shown two labels which were marked “C-SL-18-00032-1 SURIANNY BINTE SULAIMAN” and “C-SL-18-00032-2 SURIANNY BINTE SULAIMAN”. She verified her particulars on the labels and signed on them. The signed labels were affixed to the two bottles separately and sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU”. The Accused deposited the two bottles into two metal boxes belonging to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) separately. On 27 December 2018, the two bottles were submitted to the HSA’s Analytical Toxicology Laboratory for analysis.

7       On 28 December 2018, one Zhang HuiFen Hannah, an analyst employed by the HSA, issued a certificate under section 16 of the MDA bearing laboratory number “AT-1833-12263-001-03”, stating that on analysis, the urine specimen in the bottle marked “C-SL-18-00032-1 SURIANNY BINTE SULAIMAN” was found to contain methamphetamine.

8       On 28 December 2018, one Kwok Yi Ling Miiko, an analyst employed by the HSA, issued a certificate under section 16 of the MDA bearing laboratory number “AT-1833-12263- 002-03”, stating that on analysis, the urine specimen in the bottle marked “C-SL-18-00032-2 SURIANNY BINTE SULAIMAN” was found to contain methamphetamine.

9       The Accused was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume methamphetamine.

10     On 25 February 2019, the Defence made written representations to the Prosecution. On 19 August 2019, the Prosecution replied to the Defence’s representations.

11     Parties agreed that all documentary exhibits listed in Annex A may be admitted as Prosecution exhibits without the need to call the witnesses to the stand.

12     Parties agreed that the documentary exhibit listed in Annex B may be admitted as a Defence exhibit without the need to call the witness to the stand.

## Prosecution’s case

13     The Accused was presumed under s 22 of the MDA to have consumed drugs. The Accused had not rebutted this presumption.

## Defence’s case

14     The Accused’s urine tested positive for methamphetamine as she had sipped from a drink placed by her husband in their home refrigerator. Essentially, the spiking defence was in play.

## Issues to be determined

15     The issues to be determined are:

> (a)     whether the s 22 MDA Presumption has been invoked (‘Issue 1’);

> (b)     if ‘yes’, whether the Accused has rebutted the presumption on a balance of probabilities (‘Issue 2’).

16     Briefly, my answers are ‘Yes’ to Issue 1 and ‘No’ to Issue 2.

## Issue 1: Whether the s 22 presumption has been invoked

17     Section 22 of the MDA reads:

> If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).

18     The Prosecution relied on the presumption under s 22 of the MDA –when a controlled drug is found in the urine specimen of a person as a result of urine tests conducted under s 31(4)(b) of the MDA, that person shall be presumed until the contrary is proved to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of s 8(b) of the MDA.

19     Two Health Sciences Authority (HSA) certificates under s 16 of the MDA were admitted into evidence. The first certificate bearing Lab No. AT-1833-12263-001-03, issued by the analyst, Zhang HuiFen Hannah, stated that on analysis, the Accused’s urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.[^1] The second certificate bearing Lab No. AT-1833-12263- 002-03 issued by the analyst, Kwok Yi Ling Miiko, similarly stated that on analysis, the Accused’s urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.[^2] The two certificates complied with s 16 of the MDA and could be relied on to prove that the Accused’s urine specimens contained methamphetamine: _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 802</span> at \[27\], \[37\], and \[42\].

20     The interplay between ss 16, 22, and 31 of the MDA was explained by the Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris_ at \[34\] to \[45\] (see generally Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir et. al., _Criminal Procedure, Evidence and Sentencing_, (2011) 12 SAL Ann. Rev. 243 at \[13.58\] to \[13.63\]). For instance, ss 16 and 22 of the MDA have different functions – they exist separately and operate independently of each other, possess different prerequisites, and give rise to presumptions which are different in nature: _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris_ at \[35\].

21     Successfully rebutting the s 16 presumption would mean rebutting the s 22 presumption because it would fatally undermine the implicit assumption of s 22 (i.e. that the two urine tests mentioned in section 31(4)(b) are accurate in identifying the specified drug(s) in the urine sample in question): _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris_ at \[35\].

22     In the present case, based on the evidence, I was satisfied that the presumption under s 22 of the MDA has been correctly invoked.

## Issue 2: Whether this presumption has been rebutted on a balance of probabilities

23     Once the presumption under s 22 of the MDA is triggered (i.e. the drug is found in the accused person’s urine), both the _mens rea_ and _actus reus_ of the drug consumption offence are satisfied; the burden of proof then falls upon the Defence who would have to disprove either element on a balance of probabilities, and it is insufficient for the accused person to merely raise a reasonable doubt: _Vadugaiah Mahendran v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 719</span> at \[23\] and \[24\], affirmed by the Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris_ at \[10\] (see also _Lim Chee Huat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 433</span> at \[70\]).

24      Spiking Defence. Although it is not the law that a commonly-used defence of spiking will not be accepted, a judge may be obliged to approach such a defence with greater caution and circumspection than usual in the absence of any other credible evidence: _Cheng Siah Johnson v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 839</span> at \[15\], and _Public Prosecutor v Tan Chui Yun Joselyn_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 85</span> at \[20\].

25     While the courts should be sensitive to the efficacy of the presumption in combating drug consumption, it is equally true that the presumption should not place too onerous a burden on a defendant. In order to rebut the presumption, the Defence is not required to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that someone has tampered with the drinks. That would be tantamount to making the offence one of strict liability.

26     Whether the Defence has managed to rebut the presumption remains a question of fact to be decided on the totality of the circumstances of each case: _Tan Chui Yun Joselyn_ at \[20\], and applied in _Public Prosecutor v Tan Loon Lui_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 216</span> at \[22\] (see generally Glenn Seah Kim Ming, _Criminal Procedure, Evidence and Sentencing_, SAL Annual Review 2003 at 205 to 207, under the heading “Spiker Defence – Section 22 of the Misuse of Drugs Act – Standard of Proof” at \[11.63\] to \[11.71\], and Chan Wei Xian, _Your Honour, but my drink was spiked_, The MINDEF Legal Counsel (October 2003) at 8-10). For a case where the defence successfully rebutted the presumption, see _Public Prosecutor v Lee Voot Seong <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGDC 60</span> at \[7\] to \[43\]_.

27     For completeness, a helpful summary of the cases relating to the spiking defence can be found in _Public Prosecutor v Poh Teck Khoon_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 17</span> at \[17\] to \[29\], particularly at \[23\] and \[27\]-\[29\].

28     In the present case, at about 3a.m. on 26 December 2018, the Accused said that after quarrelling with her husband, she needed a drink to cool down as she was thirsty.[^3] She sipped once or twice from a glass mug half-filled with a dark-coloured drink, which had been placed by her husband in their home refrigerator;[^4] during cross-examination, she testified that it was the “freezer”.[^5] Essentially, she raised the spiking defence.

29     I did not accept the Accused’s version of events. There are three interlacing reasons.

30     First, the Accused failed to mention her spiking defence in _any_ of her statements recorded by the authorities.[^6] She did not mention it in her contemporaneous statement,[^7] long statements[^8] or cautioned statement.[^9] Notably, her statements had been recorded separately over several weeks. The spiking defence only surfaced in late February 2019 in the Defence Counsel’s representations.[^10]

31     The Accused explained that she failed to mention her spiking defence in her statements because she was possessed of the need to be certain that her husband had mixed drugs into the drink before implicating him.[^11] However, given that she was facing a sword of Damocles – penal consequences (_viz_. likely jail sentence) – this argument gave me pause. The following excerpt from her cautioned statement under s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) brought this to sharp focus:[^12]

> Do you want to say anything about the charge that was just read to you? **If you keep quiet now about any facts or matter in your defense and you reveal his fact or matter in your defense only at your trial, the judge may be less likely to believe you. This may have a bad effect on your case in court. Therefore, it may be better for you to mention such facts or matter now.** If you wish to do so, what you say will be written down, read back to you for any mistakes to be corrected and then signed by you. \[bold added\]

32     Allied to this, if the spiking defence is true, the Accused should have, at the very least, mentioned in her statements that she suspected that the mug had been spiked without necessarily revealing any specific names at that stage. However, the Accused failed to do so.

33     On a related note, her husband’s statements recorded by the authorities (P9 and P10) also did not contain any reference to her spiking defence.[^13] One could possibly advance the point that he had little reason in his statements to mention his wife’s spiking defence. But that was not his testimony in court. In fact, he claimed that he had mentioned her spiking defence to the recorder but its provenance had not been recorded in his statements.[^14] He neither read his statements nor were they read back to him.[^15]

34     I did not accept his explanation. The recorder of P9 and P10, Staff Sergeant Syazana Hidayu Binte Sazali (‘SSgt Syazana Hidayu’),[^16] testified that the Accused’s husband did not mention her spiking defence during the recording of his statements. SSgt Syazana Hidayu also affirmed that she had asked him open-ended questions and recorded everything that he wanted to say.[^17] SSgt Syazana Hidayu confirmed that he was read back his statements in Malay and was invited to amend any part of his statements before acknowledging that they were correct and that he had no complaints.[^18] Hand-written additions were made to P9 by SSgt Syazana Hidayu and countersigned by him.[^19] Taken together, these countersigned hand-written additions overlaid with the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officer’s cogent testimony militate against believing the Accused’s husband’s contention.

35     Second, the Accused’s version is inconsistent with her husband’s version for the spiking defence. Her husband testified that he had placed the mug in the non-freezer compartment of their refrigerator.[^20] In contrast, the Accused testified that the mug had been placed in the freezer;[^21] her version also finds expression in the Case for the Defence:

> Our client went to the fridge to get a drink. She saw there was a mug of coca-cola in the **freezer**. It is her husband’s habit to pour drinks into a mug and leave it in the **freezer** compartment. \[bold added\][^22]

36     Third, many drugs and drug utensils were lying around the Accused’s home.[^23] These drug and drug utensils are described in the Police Report (NP299):[^24]

37     The CNB officers testified that they saw drugs and drug utensils lying around the Accused’s home. Staff Sergeant Muhammad Radi Bin Aziz[^25] attested to the fact that “during the search, there were drugs and drug paraphernalia found in places in the house such as the living room, on the table, beside the bed and on the bed”.[^26] Woman Sergeant 3 Toh Yang Qi[^27] stated that there were smoking utensils (glass bong for smoking ‘Ice’) on a coffee table in the home,[^28] and added that during a search they “recover(ed) more drugs on the table, on the bed, uh---**everywhere**, lah, inside the house” (emphasis added).[^29]

38     Given that drugs and drug utensils were lying around the Accused’s home,[^30] it is manifest that she would have seen and known about these drugs and drug utensils. Although the Accused claimed otherwise[^31] – she said that she “didn’t want to check because (she) didn’t know what is it, so (she) just turned a blind eye. (She) didn’t---didn’t bother checking”[^32] – and added that she did not really clean the house as she was then at her lowest point,[^33] I am unable to accept the Accused’s explanation.[^34] My view is fortified by the fact that by her own admission, she was at home “90% of the time” so home was her province.[^35]

39     Furthermore, her husband testified that she had seen him smoking Ice at home.[^36] This occasioned his argument with the Accused on 26 December 2018.[^37] In fact, the Defence Counsel stated in court and in closing submissions that the Accused had seen her husband smoking Ice at home.[^38]

40     Taken together, given that (i) the Accused would have seen and known about the drugs and drug utensils in her home, (ii) she knew about her husband’s drug antecedents,[^39] and (iii) she had also seen him consume drugs at home, it stands to reason that these points would coalesce into her exercising greater caution before imbibing his drinks.[^40] Moreover, it is unlikely that her husband would simply leave his drink – laced with illegal drugs – lying around the home on the table or in the freezer.[^41] This would be patently unsafe as the banned concoction would be within easy reach of their two children aged 6 and 7 years.[^42] And this would run counter to a parent’s primal protective instincts.[^43]

41     To be sure, there was a “spiker” (the Accused’s husband) who asserted that he had mixed the methamphetamine in carbonated water without the Accused’s knowledge.[^44] Tracing the provenance arc, his version was conveyed to the CNB in a statement on 17 July 2019[^45] and retold in a letter to the Accused in June 2020, 3 weeks before trial.[^46] The Defence posits that there is no collusion with the Accused as husband and wife argued often and are not on good terms.[^47] But the fact remains that they have been a married couple for more than 10 years, and she is a mother and primary care-giver to his two children.[^48] He also telegraphed his love and care for his wife and children in court.[^49] In short, he sacrificed himself for his family and took the rap – _viz._ he took one for the team.[^50] And he may feel that he has nothing to lose as he is already serving a lengthy custodial sentence of 6 years and 8 months’ imprisonment for several drug charges, including drug consumption.[^51]

42     The case of _Tan Chui Yun Joselyn_ can be distinguished on its facts from the present case. In that case, there was a witness (Chris) “who was found to have been ‘clear and lucid’ – (who) corroborated Joselyn’s version of events. As such, there was a finding of fact that Joselyn had indeed taken a drink offered her by a man in a white shirt who had been with Dennis” (at \[17\]). In addition, the District Court had found Dennis to be lying (at \[17\] and \[20\]):

> … In particular, the district judge found the fact that Dennis denied being at the pub on the night of 2 May 2002 to be significant. If he had been at the pub but had not spiked her drink, he should simply have testified to that effect. However, his categorical denial that he had been at the pub, when both Joselyn and Chris had testified to the contrary, showed that he had something to hide. It was this fact which led the district judge to conclude that there was a strong probability that Dennis may indeed have colluded with another person to spike Joselyn’s drink. (at \[20\]).

43     I was mindful that although the Prosecution has a statutory presumption operating in its favour, when it comes to assessing the evidence to determine whether the presumption has been rebutted, the starting point should be neutral with no predilection for either conclusion. The real significance of the statutory presumption is that it reverses the burden of proof. But once the evidence has been led, it must be evaluated neutrally to determine whether the presumption has been rebutted: _Gopu Jaya Raman v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 499</span> at \[25\].

## Impeachment

44      The Law for Impeachment. Guidance on the scope and relevance of an impeachment exercise can be found in _Osman Bin Ramli v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 959</span> at \[29\] to \[32\]:

> (a)     First, “innocent” discrepancies must be distinguished from deliberate lies.

> (b)     Second, the credibility of a witness cannot be impeached unless there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions in his evidence. “Serious discrepancies” or “material contradictions” are those that go to the crux of the charge against the accused.

> (c)     Third, even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it does not automatically lead to a total rejection of his evidence. The court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded.

45     The credit of the witness is impeached upon the inconsistent former statement being proved, _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[22\].

46     In the present case, the Prosecution sought to impeach the credit of the Accused’s husband on certain portions of his statements to the CNB and his testimony in court. The Prosecution succeeded in doing so. I shall analyse portions of his statements – which the witness agreed had been voluntarily given[^52] – and which were highlighted by the Prosecution in court, against his testimony.

47     For his statement recorded on 27 December 2018,[^53] paragraph 19 reads:

> I recognized the photograph label as Photo 8. I recognized this as ‘Ice’, ‘popeye’ and straw. I was then instructed to write down to my best knowledge. (Recorder’s note: Accused was shown Photo 8 and accused wrote in Malay language after which he append his signature and date.) I am now required to give further information pertaining to what I wrote on the given space. This is the packet of ‘Ice’ that I have weighed and rationed out for me to smoke daily. As for the ‘popeye’ it is for me to smoke ‘Ice’. The straw is for me to scoop abit \[_sic_\] of ‘Ice’ and put it into the ‘popeye’. All this is mine and for my own consumption. \[emphasis added\]

48     The Prosecution pointed out that he did not mention consuming methamphetamine by mixing it with a soft drink in paragraph 19.[^54] The Accused’s husband agreed and explained that this is because he was simply answering the question of whether he had smoked ‘Ice’.[^55] Notwithstanding the recorder’s testimony that her question to him had been “why is your urine positive”,[^56] there did not appear to be a contradiction per se.

49     Paragraph 21[^57] reads:

> I last smoke ‘Ice’ the night before my arrest. I smoke using the bong which I had mention earlier in my statement. I can’t remember from which packet of ‘Ice’ that I had use to smoke ‘Ice’. After smoking ‘Ice’, I will sleep. \[emphasis added\]

50     The Prosecution pointed out that he did not mention consuming methamphetamine by mixing it with a soft drink in paragraph 21.[^58] The Accused’s husband agreed and explained that this is because he was simply answering the question of whether he had smoked ‘Ice’.[^59] Notwithstanding the recorder’s testimony that her question to him had been “why is your urine positive”,[^60] there did not appear to be a contradiction per se.

51     Paragraph 27[^61] reads

> My wife is aware of the drugs as I told her before because it is lying around all over in the house. She did question me why I have a lot of ‘Ice’ and I told her it is for me to smoke. I did not smoke ‘Ice’ with my wife before. I do not know if she smoke ‘Ice’ behind my back but in front of me, I have never seen her smoke ‘Ice’. My time at home is limited. After I finish work at about 9pm to 10pm, I will usually go gambling at different places, mostly Geylang. Then, I will be at home at about 1 or 2 am, then I smoke ‘Ice’ in the toilet and go to sleep. So, my wife has a lot of time alone at home because both my kids are in childcare. My wife has seen me smoke ‘Ice’ before at home. \[emphasis added\]

52     In his testimony, he denied that the Accused knew about the drugs at home.[^62] However, in paragraph 27, he admitted that the Accused was “aware of the drugs as I told her before because it is lying around all over in the house. She did question me why I have a lot of ‘Ice’ and I told her it is for me to smoke” (emphasis added).

53     When asked to explain the discrepancy, he said that he meant that she was aware that he was a drug addict, and it was during the CNB officers’ search that the drugs were lying all over the home.[^63] Explaining the key word in the first sentence in paragraph 27 (_viz._ ‘before’), he said that he told the Accused about his drug antecedents when he was released from DRC (Drug Rehabilitation Centre) and when they got married,[^64] and that she found out about the drugs at home during the search by the CNB officers.[^65] He added that he had accidentally left the ‘bong’ on the table before the said search as he had been in a rush to hide all of the drug items.[^66] In my judgment, there is a serious discrepancy.

54     In his testimony, the Accused’s husband said that he smoked ‘Ice’ outside the home and not inside the home.[^67] But in paragraph 27, he admitted to smoking ‘Ice’ in the toilet at home. When asked to explain the discrepancy, he said that he smoked ‘Ice’ in the toilet at home on one or two occasions when the children were asleep.[^68] He added that he would exhale the smoke from the small toilet window so that the smoke would not re-enter the home.[^69] In my judgment, there is a serious discrepancy.

55     In his testimony, he denied that the Accused had seen him smoke ‘Ice’ at home.[^70] However, in paragraph 27, he admitted that the Accused “has seen me smoke ‘Ice’ before at home”. When asked to explain the discrepancy, he said that he was referring to the night of the arrest where the Accused had seen him smoking in the toilet, which occasioned their argument.[^71] In my judgment, there is a serious discrepancy.

56     For his statement recorded on 29 January 2019,[^72] paragraph 34 reads:

> For 25g of ‘Ice’ it will last me for about a month. In a day I will smoke about 06 to 10 times a day. The amount of ‘Ice’ that I placed at the ‘bong’ is about 06g. It will last me for the 02 to 03 days. I smoke ‘Ice’ on a daily basis. If I finish up my stock and I do not have a lot of money, I will buy about 6g for $200. This 6g I buy from Geylang. I will go to Geylang and ask around for ‘Ice’. I buy from different people on different occasions. All of them I do not know who they are and I do not have their contact number. \[emphasis added\]

57     The Prosecution pointed out that he did not mention consuming methamphetamine by mixing it with a soft drink in paragraph 34.[^73] The Accused’s husband agreed. In my judgment, there did not appear to be a contradiction per se.

58     In the present case, there were serious discrepancies that went to the crux of the charge: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ at \[26\], and _Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[33\].  In the circumstances, the credit of the witness was impeached. In my analysis of the impeachment application, I took into account the totality of the evidence tendered at trial: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ at \[21\].

59     I was aware that even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it did not automatically lead to a total rejection of his evidence; the court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded: _Osman Bin Ramli_ at \[32\].

## Verdict

60     I was mindful that in criminal proceedings, it is the Prosecution’s burden to prove its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. It is for the Prosecution, and not the court, to fill in any gaps in the Prosecution’s case. This is not least because while the Prosecution is charged with a number of significant burdens (such as having to prove its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt), it has access to the police, the investigating authorities, as well as witnesses and their statements, and is also armed with and assisted by various tools (such as statutory presumptions): _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad_ at \[171\]-\[172\].

61     Based on the evidence, I found that the presumption under s 22 of the MDA was invoked, and it had not been rebutted on a balance of probabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, I would have arrived at the same conclusion regardless of whether the Accused’s husband’s credit had been impeached.

62     Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on the drug consumption charge.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

63     The prescribed punishment for s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to both. The sentencing range for first-time offenders is 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment: _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> at \[38\] (see also the Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition: Volume II, LexisNexis, 2013) at pages 1194-1195 and 1200-1202).

64     The Sentencing Information and Research Repository (‘SIR’) provides as follows for s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA (_viz._ imprisonment):

![]([2020] SGDC 0182_Image/[2020] SGDC 0182_image1.png)

65     The offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought therefore to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament: _Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 684</span> at \[44\] (see also Benny Tan, _Assessing the Effectiveness of Sentencing Guideline Judgments in Singapore Issued Post-March 2013 and A Guide to Constructing Frameworks_, <span class="citation">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 1004</span> at \[46\]).

66     In other words, the court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence: _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> at \[60\] (see also the parliamentary debates on the amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act in 2012 \[_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (14 November 2012) Vol 89\]).

67     In the present case, the Accused had consumed methamphetamine.

68     By way of background, the then-Minister for Home Affairs had already warned in 2006 against the emerging threat of synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine \[_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (16 January 2006) vol. 80 at col 2095\]:

> ... \[T\]here is the emerging threat of synthetic drugs such as 'Ecstasy', Ketamine, _Methamphetamine_, and Nimetazepam. Indeed, the trafficking and _abuse of synthetic drugs continues to be a major concern in the region_ … (emphasis added)

69     Against this backdrop, it is apposite to note the global milieu of methamphetamine having the largest market worldwide for amphetamine-type stimulants: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s (UNODC) World Drug Report (June 2020).

70     Consequently, Singapore needs to maintain its “zero tolerance” approach towards drug abuse. Singapore is fully committed to providing a safe and healthy environment that allows people to live, work and play, free from the scourge of drugs: Singapore’s National Statement by Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs, 62nd Session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) (16 March 2019) at \[8\] and \[18\].

### Antecedents

71     The Accused has no prior antecedents.[^74]

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

72     The Prosecution sought a 10-month imprisonment term.[^75]

### Mitigation plea

73     The Defence sought an 8-month imprisonment term.[^76] Amongst other things, due to the Accused’s husband’s incarceration, she is “basically more or less a single mother bringing up 2 very young children”, one of whom is autistic.[^77]

### Decision on sentence

74     Sentencing is ultimately an exercise in evaluative ethical judgment: _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> at \[48\] (see Anthony Hooper, _Sentencing: Art or Science_, <span class="citation">(2015) 27 SAcLJ 17</span>).

75     I turn now to the interplay of harm, culpability, mitigating and aggravating factors (“Analytical Framework”) that lends itself well to sentencing.

76     Harm is a measure of the injury that has been caused to society by the commission of the offence: _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span> at \[41\]. Harm may:

> (a)     Cleave into “physical harm” and “psychological harm” for maid abuse cases under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code: _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1315</span> at \[70\]-\[72\] (see also _Public Prosecutor v Bong Sim Swan, Suzanna_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 82</span> at \[60\]-\[63\] and \[74\]-\[79\]); and

> (b)     Include serious economic loss to the victim under s 17(1) of the Medical Registration Act: _Neo Ah Luan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1153</span> at \[69\].

77     Culpability is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act: _Public Prosecutor v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1141</span> at \[35\] (see Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (Cambridge University Press, 6th Ed, 2015) at \[4.5\]).

78     Two broad observations can be made on the Analytical Framework:

> (a)     The synergistic interplay between harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing.

> (b)     The eclectic ensemble of cases adopting the Analytical Framework is testament to its versatility.

79     First, the synergistic interplay of harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing. While facts are the cornerstone, harm and culpability are the pillars on which we place the cross-beams of aggravating and mitigating factors.

80     The typical framework consists of a 2-step sentencing bands framework as found in _Ng Kean Meng Terence_ at \[73(a), (c) and (d)\] (see also _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span> at \[71\]-\[84\]).

81     At the first step, the court should have regard to the _offence-specific_ factors in deciding which band the offence in question falls under. Offence-specific factors comprise factors going towards: (a) the harm caused by the offence; and (b) the offender’s culpability.

82     These categories may not always be watertight. For instance, the degree of planning and premeditation and the level of sophistication, were categorised as offence-specific factors going towards the offender’s _culpability_ in _Logachev Vladislav_. Yet, the High Court observed that they may also relate to the _harm_ caused by the offence in so far as they affect the likelihood of harm: _Logachev Vladislav_ at \[38\] (see also _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> at \[79\], and _Public Prosecutor v ASR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 941</span> at \[131\]).

83     Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may usually be imposed for an offence with those features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an indicative starting point.

84     At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender to calibrate the sentence. These _offender-specific_ factors comprise other aggravating and mitigating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence: _Logachev Vladislav_ at \[34\], and _Ng Kean Meng Terence_ at \[39(b)\].

85     A slight variant of the 2-step sentencing bands framework finds expression in drug trafficking and importation cases where the quantity of the drugs indicates the potential harm to society.  In this regard, the indicative starting sentence – based on the quantity of the drugs (_viz._ potential harm) – may be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors.  Essentially, _harm_ is the fulcrum for such cases.

86     Examples of these cases include _Vasentha d/o Joseph_ at \[43\]-\[48\] (drug trafficking) and _Suventher Shanmugam_ at \[29\]-\[30\] (drug importation).

87     In similar vein, for voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code, the seriousness of the injury caused (_viz._ harm) is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and guides the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing. The indicative starting sentence may then be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and other aggravating and mitigating factors: _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> at \[55\].  The same approach applies for s 323 of the Penal Code: _Low Song Chye_ at \[76\]-\[78\].

88     Another model of the 2-step sentencing bands framework can be found in fatal accident cases under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code. For such cases, as the harm is the death of the victim, the harm is generally uniform. Accordingly, what sets such cases apart is, in the vast majority of cases, determined primarily by the accused’s culpability. After considering the accused’s culpability, a sentencing court takes into account other aggravating and mitigating factors: _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 681</span> at \[54\].

89     Finally, in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> at \[52\], \[57\] and \[60\], the 3-Judge Panel noted that the:

> offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors are necessarily factored into the analysis within the harm and culpability considerations themselves.

90     An example of this approach may be found in _Public Prosecutor v Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 707</span> at \[50\]-\[56\], where the 3-Judge Panel held that exceptional performance during National Service was not a mitigating factor, as it reduces neither the defaulter’s _culpability_ nor the _harm_ he had caused by his offence.

91     For completeness, in lieu of using the 2-step sentencing bands framework as a starting point for sentencing, the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chai Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1275</span> stated that the starting inquiry in sentencing offenders with a mental disorder ought to be whether the deterrent, retributive and protective principles of sentencing prevail over the principle of rehabilitation. 

92     The second observation is that the eclectic ensemble of cases adopting the Analytical Framework is testament to its versatility.

93     These cases include participating in a corrupt transaction with an agent under s 6 read with s 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (_Public Prosecutor v Wong Chee Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 144</span>), stalking under s 7 of the Protection from Harassment Act (_Lee Shing Chan and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 41</span>), s 331(3A) read with s 240(1) of the Securities and Futures Act (_Public Prosecutor v Tan Seo Whatt Albert and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 654</span> at \[50\]-\[56\]), s 23(1) of the Infectious Diseases Act (_GCP v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 626</span>), cheating at play under s 172A(2) of the Casino Control Act (_Logachev Vladislav_), digital-penetration under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code (_Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span>), offences under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (_Public Prosecutor v GS Engineering & Construction Corp_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 682</span>), and ss 140, 146, and 148 of the Women’s Charter (_Poh Boon Kiat_). The above list is non-exhaustive.

94     I was mindful that in assessing the level of harm or potential harm, the sentencing court should be careful not to double-count any factors which may already have been taken into account in assessing the level of culpability: _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 1005</span> at \[58\] and _Wong Chee Meng_ at \[57\] (see also Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (6th Ed, 2015, Cambridge University Press) at \[4.3\] and \[4.5\]).

95      Culpability. Given that the Accused is 38 years old and a mother of 2 children, she is not young and immature: _Terashima Jun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 17</span> at \[14\] (where the 45-year-old accused person was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment). In the present case, there was no evidence to suggest that this was a case of drug consumption which was not planned or committed on the spur of the moment.

96      Claiming Trial. Although claiming trial is not an aggravating factor, no discount would be given to offenders who elect to claim trial: _Mohd Shahrin bin Shwi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 174</span> at \[21\]-\[22\] (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[20.147\]).

97      No Prior Antecedents. I gave due weight to the fact that the Accused had no prior antecedents.

98      Personal Circumstances. The Defence alluded to the fact that being the primary caregiver to the children (due to her husband’s incarceration), the Accused’s incarceration would bring hardship to the family.[^78]

99     However, personal circumstances such as hardship caused to the family by incarceration have no mitigating value save in the most exceptional cases: _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span> at \[10\]-\[11\]. In the present case, I saw no cogent reasons to consider her family circumstances as valid mitigating factors, albeit I empathise with the fact that the Accused has two fairly young children, one of whom is autistic. For completeness, the Accused’s mother helps to look after the two children.[^79]

100     Proportionality. I kept in mind the proportionality principle in sentencing: _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[30\]. Under the proportionality principle, the sentence to be imposed must not only bear a reasonable proportion to the maximum prescribed penalty, but also to the gravity of the offence committed (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[06.091\]-\[06.093\]) (see also Ho Hsi Ming Shawn, _The Centrality of Proportionality: A Golden Thread in Sentencing_, Singapore Law Gazette (July 2020)).

101     Sentence. All things considered, a sentence higher than the 8 months’ imprisonment meted out in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh_ – where the accused person had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity (at \[56\]) – was called for. The Accused was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment. The sentence has been stayed pending appeal.[^80]

## Conclusion

### Summary

102    A summary of my Grounds of Decision is as follows:

> (a)      **Issue 1:** Yes, the s 22 MDA presumption was invoked (at \[17\] to \[22\]).

> (b)      **Issue 2:** No, the Accused failed to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities (at \[23\] to \[43\]).

103    Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on the drug consumption charge. She was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment. The sentence has been stayed pending appeal.

104    In closing, I am grateful for the hard work and assistance of both sides.
