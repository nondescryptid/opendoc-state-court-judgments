Arbitration – Stay of court proceedings – Standard of review – Whether prima facie case established that Plaintiff was a party to the arbitration clause

Arbitration – Stay of court proceedings – Case management stay

2 November 2020 - Judgement reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Sheik Umar Bin Mohamed Bagushair:

1       The Plaintiff commenced DC/DC 1044/2020 (“Suit”) against the Defendant for salary arrears during his time as the Defendant’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The Defendant filed DC/SUM 1603/2020 to stay the Suit pursuant to Section 6 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”). In the alternative, the Defendant seeks a case management stay.

2       The arbitration clause at issue was in an agreement to which the Plaintiff was not a party. However, the Defendant and a number of other related parties, including a company of which the Plaintiff was a managing director, were parties to that agreement. I had to consider whether the Defendant could establish a _prima facie_ case that the Plaintiff was nevertheless bound to the arbitration clause. I also had to consider whether a case management stay should be granted in favour of an arbitration that had been commenced in India.

## Material Background Facts

3       The Plaintiff was for many years a senior executive in SSP Group, one of the biggest F&B operators in airports and train stations. In 2016, he left to start his own business investing and running restaurants.

4       Together with his wife Ms Velma Vimmi (“Ms Velma”) and their family friends Ms Richa Kansal (“Ms Richa”) and Mr Amit Kansal (“Mr Amit”), they incorporated Fusion Concepts Pte Ltd (“FCPL”) to invest and run restaurants. All four were directors of FCPL and the Plaintiff the managing director. Only Ms Velma and Ms Richa were shareholders (holding 67% and 37% of the shares respectively).

5       Sometime in 2016, the Plaintiff and Bikanervala Food Private Limited (“BFPL India”) agreed to work together to set up in Singapore food outlets under the Bikanervala brand, and sell food products manufactured by BFPL India. On 27 January 2017, FCPL and BFPL India entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) for this purpose.

6       BFPL India incorporated a Singapore subsidiary, BFPL Singapore Pte Ltd (“BFPL SG”). It was decided that the joint venture envisaged in the MOU would take the form of a joint venture company incorporated in Singapore that would be owned by BFPL SG and FCPL equally. The joint venture company is the Defendant.

7       On 9 March 2017, FCPL, BFPL India, BFPL SG and the Defendant entered into a joint venture agreement (“JVA”). The governing law of the JVA was Indian law and the dispute resolution clause provided for disputes to be resolved by arbitration in New Delhi:

> 47.    Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

> This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of India. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement (“Dispute”), including but not limited to any question regarding the existence, interpretation, performance, enforcement or termination of this Agreement shall be resolved by reference to a sole arbitrator to be mutually appointed by the disputing parties in accordance with the provision of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, as amended. Arbitration shall be held in New Delhi. The proceedings of arbitration shall be in the English language. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on the Parties.

> 48.    Jurisdiction

> Subject to Clause 50 above, the competent courts of New Delhi shall have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of any matter arising out of this Agreement.

8       Although Clause 48 of the JVA refers to Clause 50, I believe that is a typographical error as the reference should be to Clause 47. Clause 50 is the counterparts clause. I will refer to Clause 47 of the JVA as the “arbitration clause”.

9       Under the JVA, the Plaintiff and his daughter Ms Megha Verma would become directors of the Defendant, together with 3 other directors who would represent BFPL SG’s interest. The Plaintiff was also appointed CEO of the Defendant. Although the Plaintiff CEO was not a party to the JVA, the JVA nevertheless imposed certain obligations on him.

10     The joint venture appeared to be successful, at least initially. However, the relationship between parties soured sometime in July 2019. The dispute initially was over the non-payment of the Plaintiff’s salary as CEO. On 3 October 2019, the Plaintiff purported to resign as CEO but did not apparently see it through and continued working.

11     Sometime in December 2019, the Defendant’s then account manager, Ms Goh Lay Lan (“Ms Goh”), resigned. Ms Chhavi Goel (“Ms Chhavi”), an employee of BPFL SG, took over Ms Goh’s role. Ms Chhavi discovered numerous issues with the management of the Defendant and its finances.

12     As a result of this discovery, in April 2020, the 3 BFPL SG directors passed several board resolutions effectively curtailing the Plaintiff’s ability to unilaterally make decisions in relation to the Defendant.

13     On 21 April 2020, the Plaintiff commenced the Suit for what is a fairly straightforward claim for unpaid salaries for the months of August 2019 to March 2020. On 13 May 2020, the Defendant filed this stay application.

14     On 13 June 2020, BFPL India and BFPL SG issued a legal notice (“Legal Notice”) to the Plaintiff, FCPL and the Defendant. The Defendant says this had the effect of commencing arbitration proceedings pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act (“IAC Act”). The Plaintiff disputes this. The Legal Notice makes a number of allegations against the Plaintiff and FCPL and asserts that the JVA has been breached. For convenience, and in the context of the arbitration, I will refer to BFPL India and BFPL SG collectively as the “claimants” and the Plaintiff, FCPL and the Defendant collectively as the “respondents”.

15     On 10 July 2020, FCPL replied to the Legal Notice (“Reply”).

16     On 24 July 2020, FCPL brought a petition to the High Court of Delhi against BFPL India, BFPL SG and the Defendant. The petition was filed pursuant to Section 9 of the IAC Act which granted the court power to order interim relief before or during arbitration proceedings. FCPL claimed that the board resolutions passed by the 3 BFPL SG directors were null and void as they were in breach of the JVA and sought consequential orders barring BFPL India, BPFL SG and the Defendant from taking any further steps pursuant to those board resolutions. FCPL sought an urgent hearing and relief before the filing of any reply. However, the High Court of Delhi issued an order refusing to hear the matter without replies being filed and thus fixed the matter for a further hearing on 9 November 2020 after the filing of replies.

17     On 28 August 2020, the Plaintiff informed the Defendant that he was resigning as CEO with effect from 31 August 2020.

## Stay Pursuant to Section 6 of the IAA

18     As I alluded to earlier, the Defendant seeks a stay based on Section 6 of the IAA and in the alternative, a case management stay.

### Parties’ arguments

19     In respect of the stay based on Section 6 of IAA, the Plaintiff is not a party to the JVA. Notwithstanding this, the Defendant says that he is nevertheless bound to the JVA and the arbitration clause because:

> (a)     The Plaintiff is estopped from denying that he is bound to the JVA as he is relying on the JVA as the basis for his claims in the Suit.

> (b)     FCPL, a party to the JVA, was the Plaintiff’s _alter ego_ as it was carrying on the Plaintiff’s business and was used as a vehicle for the Plaintiff to participate in the joint venture.

> (c)     The Plaintiff by his conduct impliedly consented to the JVA, as he acted on his CEO appointment under the JVA, and also relied on the JVA in seeking to be remunerated.

Based on either of these grounds, the Defendant says it has established a _prima facie_ case that the Plaintiff is bound to the arbitration clause.

20     The Plaintiff denies that he is bound to the JVA or the arbitration clause, on any of the grounds. FCPL was not at any time the Plaintiff’s _alter ego_. The Plaintiff was not a shareholder of FCPL and he was only one of four directors of FCPL. Neither was there any estoppel or implied consent.

### Decision

21     I find that the Defendant has failed to establish a _prima facie_ case that the Plaintiff is bound by the arbitration clause in the JVA, on any of the grounds put forward. Before explaining in detail my reasons, I need to emphasise that my analysis is solely based on the application of Singapore law, expect for one issue, namely whether arbitration proceedings had commenced in India (which is governed by Indian law, and in particular, the IAC Act). Save for that, neither party argued that any other issue needed to be determined by Indian law, the governing law of the JVA. This was so even though some of the issues could possibly be governed by Indian law. But since neither party relied on Indian law or tendered evidence of Indian law (apart from the IAC Act), I proceeded on the basis that Singapore law governed the issues.

### Analysis

#### Applicable legal principles

22     Sections 6(1) and 6(2) of the IAA provides as follows:

> **Enforcement of international arbitration agreement**

> **6.**—(1)    Notwithstanding Article 8 of the Model Law, where any party to an arbitration agreement to which this Act applies institutes any proceedings in any court against any other party to the agreement in respect of any matter which is the subject of the agreement, any party to the agreement may, at any time after appearance and before delivering any pleading or taking any other step in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the proceedings so far as the proceedings relate to that matter.

> (2)    The court to which an application has been made in accordance with subsection (1) shall make an order, upon such terms or conditions as it may think fit, staying the proceedings so far as the proceedings relate to the matter, unless it is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.

23     It is common ground between parties that under Section 6 of the IAA, a court should grant a stay in favour of arbitration if the applicant is able to establish a _prima facie_ case that:

> (a)     there was a valid arbitration clause between the parties to the court proceedings;

> (b)     the dispute in the court proceedings (or any part thereof) fell within the scope of the arbitration clause; and

> (c)     the arbitration clause was not null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed

(_Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and anor v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 373</span> at \[63\] (“_Tomolugen_”)).

24     The court will only refuse to grant a stay when it is clear on the evidence placed before it that one or more of the above three requirements have not been satisfied: _Tomolugen_ at \[64\]. However, the Court of Appeal in _Wilson Taylor Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Dyna-Jet Pte Ltd_ \[2017\] 2 SLR 363 (“_Dyna-Jet_”) also explained at \[15\] that:

> The fact that the court is to apply a _prima facie_ standard of review…does not mean that it must turn a blind eye to obvious drawbacks in the case put forward by an applicant, which drawbacks would not pass muster even applying an attenuated standard of review.

25     At the hearing, the Plaintiff did not seriously argue that the second and third requirements in _Tomolugen_ (_supra_ at \[22\]) were not satisfied. The arguments were focused on whether the first requirement was established, and in particular, whether the Plaintiff was bound to the arbitration clause in the JVA.

#### Estoppel

26     Although non-parties to an arbitration agreement cannot be compelled to arbitrate their disputes, this rule is subject to exceptions, as explained in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 2 (LexisNexis, 2003 Reissue) at para 20.020:

> The parties to the arbitration agreements would normally be the signatories to those agreements. There are however, several situations where non-signatories may be considered a party to the arbitration agreement. Such situations may arise by way of incorporation of an arbitration agreement by reference; or an assumption of rights or liabilities to a contract with an arbitration clause (for example assignment, novation); or where the agreement was entered into by an agent; **or the corporate veil-piercing on the basis of alter ego principle; or by the operation of the doctrine of estoppel.** \[emphasis in bold added\]

The above passage was cited with approval by Andrew Ang J in _Jiang Haiying v Tan Lin Hui and anor_ \[2009\] SLR(R) 13 at \[23\] (“_Jiang_”).

27     The Defendant relies on _Riek v Xplore-Tech Services Private Limited_ 2009 WL 891914 (M.N.D.C.) (“_Riek_”), a decision of the United States District Court of the Middle District of North Carolina, as well as the cases referred to in _Jiang_, for the proposition that in a situation where the terms of the agreement containing the arbitration clause have to be enforced in order for a party’s claim to subsist, that party is estopped from avoiding arbitration even though he was not a party to the agreement containing the arbitration clause.

Riek v Xplore-Tech Service Private Limited

28     In _Riek_, the former president of Help Desk NOW, Inc. (“Help Desk”), Riek, had made a loan to Help Desk. Subsequently, Xplore-Tech Services Private Limited (“Xplore-Tech”) purchased Help Desk pursuant to a share purchase agreement (“SPA”) and agreed to assume Help Desk’s liabilities, including Riek’s loan to Help Desk, up to a limit of USD 4.5 million. The SPA contained an arbitration clause.

29     Following the execution of the SPA, a dispute arose regarding the liabilities that Xplore-Tech had assumed. Riek filed an action against Xplore-Tech (amongst others) for repayment of the loan. The claim was based on the SPA. Xplore-Tech applied to compel arbitration of Riek’s claim. The court held that the parties to the SPA intended to benefit creditors such as Riek and Riek, although a third party, could therefore enforce the SPA. The court then considered whether the principle of equitable estoppel applied against Riek such that he became bound by the arbitration clause. The principle of equitable estoppel applies against a non-signatory who sues a signatory to an arbitration provision where the non-signatory’s underlying claim seeks a direct benefit from the contract containing the arbitration clause. Since Riek was seeking to enforce the SPA and seeking a direct benefit from the SPA, Riek was estopped from denying that he was bound by the arbitration clause in the SPA.

30     I have some doubt as to whether _Riek_ represents Singapore law. The principle in _Riek_ appears to be that a third-party beneficiary to a contract may enforce the contract, and in doing so, he would necessarily be bound by the arbitration clause in the contract. However, I am not sure such a principle, in essence a third-party beneficiary exception to the privity rule, exists under Singapore law _outside_ of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed). Indeed, the court in _Jiang_ did not think it existed: see _Jiang_ at \[45\].

31     In any event, even if _Riek_ represents Singapore law, I do not consider that it assists the Defendant. Although the Plaintiff refers to the JVA to support his claim in the Suit, he is neither seeking a direct benefit under the JVA nor is he trying to enforce any specific obligation in the JVA. On the contrary, and as both parties recognise, the JVA does not actually say that the Plaintiff is entitled to a salary. The facts are therefore different from _Riek_.

Jiang Haiying v Tan Lin Hui and anor

32     I move on to _Jiang_ and the cases cited therein. In _Jiang_, the plaintiff, Jiang, had transferred 50,000 and 490,000 shares in DHS to Tan and SPP respectively. Jiang’s position was that the shares were held on trust for his benefit but Tan and SPP denied this. SPP then sold his 490,000 shares to SPH without Jiang’s knowledge. Subsequently, as part of the listing process, Jiang, Tan and SPH effectively exchanged their DHS shares for Vita shares. Jiang was upset about the outcome of the exchange of shares as he considered it to be inequitable. Jiang entered into a sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”) to sell his Vita shares to SPH and two other individuals. The SPA contained an arbitration clause. After the SPA was concluded, Jiang commenced three suits:

> (a)     The first suit was against SPP for conversion of the 490,000 DHS shares;

> (b)     The second suit was against Tan for a declaration that Tan held the Vita shares in his name on trust for Jiang;

> (c)     The third suit was against SPH for the return of certain Vita warrants which Jiang said SPH held on trust for him.

33     The third suit, against SPH (who was a party to the SPA), was successfully stayed pursuant to the arbitration clause in the SPA. Tan and SPP also applied to stay the suits against them, even though neither of them were parties to the SPA. One of the arguments made was that the claims in the two suits were intimately intertwined with the SPA such that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applied. Tan and SPP relied on two different American decisions in support of their position. Andrew Ang J commented at \[28\] of _Jiang_ that he “was not convinced that those cases reflected the state of the law in Singapore” but that in any event, “an examination of the cases revealed that, on the facts, those two cases were not applicable to the present cases”.

Sunkist Soft Drinks, Inc v Sunkist Growers, Inc

34     The first American decision was _Sunkist Soft Drinks, Inc v Sunkist Growers_, Inc 10 F.3d 753 (11th Cir, 1993) (“_Sunkist_”). The court at \[28\] to \[29\] of _Jiang_ described the facts and holding of _Sunkist_ as follows:

> 28    …In \[_Sunkist_\]…, Sunkist Growers was the exclusive owner and licensor of the “Sunkist” trademark. Sunkist Growers granted a licence to Sunkist Soft Drinks to market and sell “Sunkist” soft drinks. The licence agreement contained an arbitration clause. Subsequently, one Del Monte Corporation (“Del Monte”) bought over Sunkist Soft Drinks from Sunkist Soft Drinks’ parent company and absorbed Sunkist Soft Drinks under Del Monte’s beverage division. Later, Sunkist Growers asserted ten claims against Del Monte and Sunkist Soft Drinks variously in tort and in contract, arising out of Del Monte’s alleged interference with the Sunkist Growers–Sunkist Soft Drinks licence agreement. Del Monte filed a motion to compel arbitration on the grounds that Sunkist was contractually bound to arbitrate its claims under the terms of the licence agreement.

> 29    The United States Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit decided, after reviewing several American cases, that Sunkist Growers was estopped from avoiding arbitration even though Del Monte was not a party to the licence agreement. The basis for its decision was as follows (at 757–758):

>> … these decisions rest on the foundation that ultimately, each party must rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting their claims. … Therefore, the focus of our inquiry should be on the nature of the underlying claims asserted by Sunkist \[Growers\] against Del Monte to determine whether those claims fall within the scope of the arbitration clause contained in the license \[_sic_\] agreement.

>> … Essentially, Sunkist \[Growers\] contends that Del Monte, through its management and operation of \[Sunkist Soft Drinks\], caused \[Sunkist Soft Drinks\] to violate various terms and provisions of the license \[_sic_\] agreement. Each claim asserted by Sunkist \[Growers\] makes reference to the license \[_sic_\] agreement. Although Sunkist \[Growers\] does not rely exclusively on the license \[_sic_\] agreement to support its claims, each claim presumes the existence of such an agreement. We find that each counterclaim maintained by Sunkist \[Growers\] arises out of and relates directly to the license \[_sic_\] agreement.

> Thus, in _Sunkist_, while the third party was not party to the contract unlike the situation in _The Smaro_, there remained a very close connection between the third party (_ie_, the non-party, Del Monte) and the agreement (containing the arbitration clause) because the terms of the written agreement had to be relied on for claims against the third party to be made. As such, the court was able to surmise as follows (at 758):

>> The nexus between Sunkist’s \[Growers\] claims and the license \[_sic_\] agreement, as well as the integral relationship between \[Sunkist Soft Drinks\] and Del Monte, leads us to the conclusion that the claims are ‘intimately founded in and intertwined with’ the license \[_sic_\] agreement. Therefore, we hold that Sunkist \[Growers\] is equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration of its claims.

Choctaw Generation Limited Partnership v American Home Assurance Company

35     The next American decision was _Choctaw Generation Limited Partnership v American Home Assurance Company_ 271 F 3d 403 (2nd Cir, 2001) (“_Choctaw_”). The court at \[30\] to \[32\] of _Jiang_ described the facts and holding of _Choctaw_ as follows:

> 30    The fact that the underlying contract must be relied on was also decisive in the second American case of \[_Choctaw_\]…. In _Choctaw_, the defendant, American Home Assurance Co (“American Home”), issued an $81m surety bond to secure the performance of one Bechtel Power Co (“Bechtel”) under a construction contract (“the Construction Contract”) between Bechtel and the plaintiff, Choctaw Generation Ltd, under which Bechtel was building a power-generation facility for the plaintiff. The project was delayed. The plaintiff sought liquidated damages in an ongoing arbitration with Bechtel pursuant to the arbitration clause of the Construction Contract. To obtain payment of the liquidated damages pending the outcome of the arbitration, the plaintiff drew down in full a $33m letter of credit which American Home had procured pursuant to the surety bond. The plaintiff then demanded, pursuant to the construction contract, that American Home replenish the letter of credit until the full $81m was drawn down to fund the rapidly accruing liquidated damages. American Home disputed its contractual requirement to do so and argued that the dispute was subject to arbitration.

> 31    The United States Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit agreed with American Home. The court opined as follows (at 406):

>> The controversy between \[the plaintiff\] and American Home under the Bond could hardly be more closely bound to the dispute now in arbitration between \[the plaintiff\] and Bechtel under the Construction Contract. The surety contract incorporates by reference the underlying Construction Contract. And the present dispute concerns the duty to replenish a letter of credit maintained under the Construction Contract, and requires a ruling as to whether that duty is independent of certain others in the context of the Construction Contract as a whole.

> And, it reiterated (at 407):

>> American Home’s argument – and presumably Bechtel’s position in the arbitration – is that since \[the plaintiff\] and Bechtel have stipulated that there is a bona fide dispute as to whether the delay in provisional acceptance is being caused by force majeure, there is no duty to replenish the letter of credit. … In short, it is American Home’s (and presumably Bechtel’s) position that \[the plaintiff\]’s drawing down of the letter of credit was an act in breach of the Construction Contract.

>> …

>> In short, the controversy presented on this appeal is linked textually to the Construction Contract, and its merits are bound up with the dispute now being arbitrated between \[the plaintiff\] and Bechtel.

> 32    Hence, in _Choctaw_ (\[30\] supra), the decisive factor was that there was a very close connection between American Home and the Construction Contract (which contained the arbitration clause) as the Construction Contract was referenced in the surety agreement; whether there was a breach of the surety agreement depended entirely on an interpretation of the Construction Contract. Accordingly, the court held that the plaintiff was estopped from denying arbitration to American Home.

36     As I mentioned earlier, the court in _Jiang_ did not think that _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ reflected Singapore law. Even if they did, the court held that the facts of _Jiang_ were far removed from either _Sunkist_ or _Choctaw_. This was because the claims were based on Tan and SPP holding the shares on trust for Jiang. The claims had little to do with the SPA, and bore no relationship, much less were they “so intertwined”, with the SPA: _Jiang_ at \[33\].

37     The issue then becomes whether, on the basis of _Jiang_, _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ and the evidence before me, the Defendant has established a _prima facie_ case that the Plaintiff is bound by the arbitration clause in the JVA on the basis of estoppel. I find that a _prima facie_ case has **not** been established, for the following reasons:

> (a)     In _Jiang_, the court held that the principles in _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ did not “\[reflect\] the state of the law in Singapore” (at \[28\] of _Jiang_). This holding is binding on me. I acknowledge that the court in _Jiang_ nevertheless proceeded to consider whether the principles in _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ were applicable to the facts in _Jiang_, ultimately finding that they were not. However, this did not detract from the clear holding that the principles in _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ did not reflect Singapore law. The court in _Jiang_ could have chosen to be more circumspect in its holding, proceeding to consider whether the principles in _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ applied to the facts, without necessarily deciding whether the principles in _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ reflected Singapore law. That was an option open to the court, especially if the position was not clear or necessitated further arguments. In this case, the court chose not to do so. Consequently, the Defendant is foreclosed from relying on the principles in _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ to establish that the Plaintiff is bound by the arbitration clause in the JVA.

> (b)     Even if I was prepared to accept that _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ represented Singapore law, the facts here were not similar to either of those cases. In _Sunkist_, the non-signatories were bound to the arbitration clause in the agreement because their claims relied on the agreement or presumed the existence of the agreement and were therefore “intimately founded in and intertwined with” the agreement. In _Choctaw_, there was a very close connection between the non-signatories’ claims and the agreement, such that whether or not their claims were established would depend on an interpretation of the agreement.

> (c)     In contrast, and based on the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim filed on 20 April 2020 (“SOC”), the Plaintiff relies on a number of different matters to support his claim, only one of which is the JVA. This is clear from \[3\] to \[5\] of the SOC:

>> **AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES**

>> 3.    It was contemplated in the JVA that the Defendant would employ the Plaintiff as its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) (the “Employment Agreement”).

>> 4.    The relevant terms and conditions of the terms of the Employment Agreement can be inferred from the discussions of the parties at the time of execution from the JVA, the terms of the JVA, and through the practice, actions and conduct of the parties.

>> 5.    Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, the Plaintiff, as CEO, is to receive a monthly salary of S$10,000.00 which equates to a net sum of S$9,220.00 (after all Central Provident Fund Board (“CPF”) deductions and contributions).

> (d)     Therefore, it cannot be said that the Plaintiff’s claim’s reliance on the JVA is such that his claim was “intimately founded in and intertwined with” the JVA. Neither can it be said that the Plaintiff’s entitlement to a salary will solely turn on the interpretation of the JVA. The fact of the matter is that the JVA does not expressly provide for the Plaintiff to be paid a salary. Of course this may suggest that the Plaintiff is not in fact entitled to a salary. However, given how the Plaintiff has pleaded his claim, the fact that the JVA does not expressly provide for the Plaintiff to be paid a salary does not determine his entitlement to a salary.

38     In this case, the Plaintiff was not a party to the JVA and the Defendant had to establish, on a _prima facie_ basis, that the Plaintiff was nonetheless bound by the JVA and its arbitration clause. The Defendant relied on _Riek_, _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ to support a theory of estoppel that would bind the Plaintiff to the arbitration clause in these circumstances. As I explained above, _Riek_ does not assist the Defendant, and _Sunkist_ and _Choctaw_ do not represent the law in Singapore. Whilst the _prima facie_ standard of review is not a high one, it “does not mean that \[the court\] must turn a blind eye to obvious drawbacks in the case put forward by an applicant” (_Dyna-Jet_ at \[15\]). Given that none of the cases relied on by the Defendant support a theory of estoppel that would bind the Plaintiff, a non-party, to the arbitration clause in the JVA, this was an obvious drawback that I could not simply overlook. The Defendant did not produce any other authorities that could support its estoppel argument. Since the Defendant could not establish a _prima facie_ case that the Plaintiff was bound to the arbitration clause in the JVA on the grounds of estoppel, a stay on this ground fails.

#### Alter ego

39     In _Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 308</span> at \[96\] (“_Alwie_”), the Court of Appeal explained that a successful assertion that a company was the _alter ego_ of an individual would lead to a lifting of the company’s corporate veil. The key question that must be asked whenever an _alter ego_ argument is raised is whether the company is carrying on the business of its controller.

40     I think it is important to look at examples where the _alter ego_ argument was raised successfully, as well as those where the _alter ego_ argument failed, to get a sense of what is meant when it is said that the company is carrying on the business of its controller.

41     In _Alwie_, the Court of Appeal took into account the following matters in concluding that the _alter ego_ argument was successfully raised (at \[97\] to \[100\]):

> (a)     The company was incorporated by the controller for the sole purpose of receiving payments under certain agreements;

> (b)     The controller was the sole director and shareholder of the company;

> (c)     The controller admitted that he controlled the company and that he was the “directing mind and will” of the company;

> (d)     The controller did not make any distinction between himself and the company when it came to monies which the company received under certain agreements;

> (e)     The controller directed that monies paid to the company were to be paid into his personal bank account.

42      _NEC Asia Pte Ltd (now known as NEC Asia Pacific Pte Ltd) v Picket & Rail Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and ors_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 565</span> (“_NEC_”), a decision of Belinda Ang J, was a case where the _alter ego_ argument failed. The court did not consider the following matters to be sufficient to establish that the company was the _alter ego_ of the alleged controller (at \[32\] to \[39\]):

> (a)     That the alleged controller was the only witness of the companies at the trial and was actively involved in the trial, suggesting that he had a vested interest over and above that of an employee or officer of the companies;

> (b)     That the alleged controller was linked to the companies, such as by being their sole shareholder;

> (c)     That the alleged controller had arranged for one company to pay the debt of another.

43     The court in _NEC_ also commented at \[36\] that “\[e\]vidence of sole shareholding and control of the company without more will not move the court to intervene.”

44      _Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd and ors v Dafni Ifal and ors_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 426</span> (“_Zim_”), a decision of Lai Siu Chiu J, was also a case where the _alter ego_ argument failed. The arguments made were that the companies had made wrongful declaration to the authorities, had misstated information on its website, and that the alleged controllers were the majority and controlling shareholders of the companies. The court held at \[86\] to \[88\] that these matters were not sufficient to lift the corporate veil of the companies.

45     Turning to our facts, it is clear on the evidence placed before me that FCPL is not the _alter ego_ of the Plaintiff. Firstly, the Plaintiff did not have sole control and management of FCPL. Although the Plaintiff was the managing director of FCPL, he was one of four directors. He was not a shareholder of FCPL. The facts are therefore very far from _Alwie_. Majority or sole shareholding, which the courts in _NEC_ and _Zim_ held was insufficient to establish an _alter ego_ claim, did not even exist.

46     The Defendant suggested that because Ms Velma held a 65% shareholding in FCPL, the Plaintiff effectively controlled FCPL. I am unable to agree. The mere fact that the Plaintiff’s wife held shares does not mean, without more, that the Plaintiff held or controlled those shares. In any event, 35% of the shareholding in FCPL (a not insubstantial shareholding) was held by the Plaintiff’s family friend and it cannot possibly be said that the Plaintiff also controlled that shareholding.

47     Secondly, the evidence shows that FCPL was not used simply to enter into the joint venture. It also invested in another F&B business, Circular Holdings Pte Ltd. That investment was made on 29 June 2016 and therefore pre-dated both the MOU and the JVA. The evidence therefore supports the Plaintiff’s position that FCPL was a vehicle used by the Plaintiff, his wife Ms Veema and their family friends Mr Amit and Ms Richa to invest in and run F&B businesses.

48     The Defendant pointed to the fact that the Plaintiff represented FCPL in its dealings with the other joint venture partners. Whilst that may be true, it does not follow that FCPL was therefore the Plaintiff’s _alter ego_. The Plaintiff was FCPL’s managing director and possessed relevant F&B experience and it was not surprising that he represented FCPL in its dealings with the joint venture partners.

49     At times, the Defendant appeared to suggest that it had established a _prima facie_ case that FCPL was the Plaintiff’s _alter ego_, simply because the claimants had commenced arbitration proceedings in India against the respondents (which included the Plaintiff) and the _alter ego_ argument had been raised in their Legal Notice. For example, the Defendant argued that:

> …in the present case, it is apparent that \[the claimants\] have made an averment that the Plaintiff is a party to the arbitration agreement, whether as a signatory to the JVA in his own stead, or as an alter ego of FCPL – which has submitted to the jurisdiction of the putative tribunal. The question of whether the Plaintiff is party to the arbitration agreement in the JVA is a question for the tribunal in New Delhi.

50     Whilst the _prima facie_ standard of review means giving necessary deference to the arbitral tribunal to decide its own jurisdiction, including whether a party is bound to the arbitration clause and is properly a party to the arbitration, it does not mean that simply asserting that a non-signatory is bound to an arbitration clause, without more, establishes a _prima facie_ case. If that were the case, then the court would have no role at all and every stay would be granted, once the averment is made. I do not think the _prima facie_ standard of review compels that conclusion.

51     Since the Defendant has failed to establish a _prima facie_ case that FCPL is an _alter ego_ of the Plaintiff, a stay on this ground necessarily fails.

#### Implied consent

52     The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff became a party to the JVA through conduct, relying on the fact that he acted on his CEO appointment under the JVA, and his reliance on the JVA in seeking to be remunerated.

53     I must confess I have trouble following the Defendant’s argument. No Singapore authorities were adduced to support the Defendant’s position. A contract can of course be entered into by conduct – for example, parties may have drafted a contract but rather than execute it, act in accordance with the terms of contract. However, I am not sure a non-signatory can become a party to a contract by conduct. I was therefore not persuaded that the Plaintiff had become a party to the JVA by conduct or by consent, even on a _prima facie_ basis. The Defendant did not press this argument strongly in any event.

54     I therefore decline to grant a stay on this basis as the Defendant has failed to establish a _prima facie_ case that the Plaintiff had become a party to the JVA by implied consent or by conduct.

#### Other arguments

55     The Plaintiff argued that given that there was an employment relationship between the parties, this suggested that parties could not have contemplated for the contract between parties to be governed by Indian law, the governing law of the JVA. The Plaintiff pointed to the fact that central provident fund (“CPF”) contributions pursuant to the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36, 2013 Rev Ed) were made for the Plaintiff, which suggested that Singapore law applied.

56     This particular argument was not fully developed by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff could not explain what effect this argument, if successful, would have on the issues of estoppel, _alter ego_ or implied conduct had I decided in the Defendant’s favour on any of these points, or on the issue of the stay. The issue arising from this argument, as I see it is this: If parties enter into a contract providing for a foreign governing law, can the forum’s mandatory rules apply to the relationship, and if so, what is the impact, if any, to the parties’ choice of foreign governing law? Without full arguments on these questions, I consider there are at least two possible answers. Either the forum court refuses to recognise the choice of foreign governing law, or the court recognises the choice, but only to the extent that it does not contradict forum mandatory rules applicable to the contractual relationship.

57     Given my findings, it is not necessary for me to resolve this issue. In any event, it appears to me that at the most, the Plaintiff’s argument may have an impact on the _choice of law_ applicable to the contractual relationship but has no impact on the issue of jurisdiction.

## Case Management Stay

### Parties’ arguments

58     The Defendant argues that the issues in the arbitration proceedings commenced in India overlap with the issues in the Suit, and without the stay there was a risk of inconsistent findings. The Plaintiff disputes that arbitration proceedings have even commenced, but argues that, in any event, there are no overlapping issues between the Suit and the arbitration.

### Decision

59     I decline to grant a case management stay as I was of the view that it would not serve the ends of justice to do so. The only possible factor pointing to a stay was a risk of inconsistent decisions, but this could be ameliorated or mitigated. There were many factors pointing against a stay – namely, the Plaintiff’s right to choose whom and where he wants to sue; there was minimal overlap in parties and issues; the Defendant was not likely to participate substantively in the arbitration; and a stay would delay the resolution of the Suit quite significantly.

### Analysis

#### Applicable legal principles

60     In _Tomolugen_, the Court of Appeal at \[186\] to \[188\] came to the following conclusions on the court’s powers to grant a case management stay:

> 186    The authorities discussed above reveal gradations of response to what is in essence the same problem as that in the situation of overlapping court and arbitral proceedings outlined at \[140\] above. We alluded to this problem in our introduction to this judgment, namely, that of seeking to uphold the statutory mandate and the strong legislative policy in favour of arbitration in circumstances where the dispute which is covered by the arbitration clause in question forms only part of a larger dispute with a broader horizon. The unifying theme amongst the cases is the recognition that the court, as the final arbiter, should take the lead in ensuring the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole. The precise measures which the court deploys to achieve that end will turn on the facts and the precise contours of the litigation in each case.

> 187    We would not set the bar for the grant of a case management stay at the “rare and compelling” threshold that the English and the New Zealand courts have adopted. We recognise that a plaintiff’s right to sue whoever he wants and where he wants is a fundamental one. But, that right is not absolute. It is restrained only to a modest extent when the plaintiff’s claim is stayed temporarily pending the resolution of a related arbitration, as opposed to when the plaintiff’s claim is shut out in its entirety: _Reichhold Norway (HC)_ (\[165\] _supra_) at 491 _per_ Moore-Bick J. In appropriate cases, that right may be curtailed or may even be regarded as subsidiary to holding the plaintiff to his obligation to arbitrate where he has agreed to do so. The strength of the plaintiff’s right of timely access to the court will therefore vary depending on the facts of each case. In a situation where there are multiple plaintiffs, some of whom are not bound to arbitrate (as in _Danone v Fonterra_ (\[175\] _supra_)), staying the court proceedings may result in a greater derogation from this right for those plaintiffs who are not bound by the arbitration clause. But, that is not a concern for us in the present appeals because Silica Investors is the _sole plaintiff_ in the Suit and is _bound to arbitrate_ at least one of the issues that it intends to rely on in the court proceedings against Lionsgate and the remaining defendants (namely, the Management Participation Allegation). The presence of the obligation to arbitrate this allegation diminishes the force of any objection that Silica Investors may raise that its right of timely access to the court is being undermined.

> 188    This does not mean that if part of a dispute is sent for arbitration, the court proceedings relating to the rest of the dispute _will_ be stayed as a matter of course. The court must in every case aim to strike a balance between three higher-order concerns that may pull in different considerations: first, a plaintiff’s right to choose whom he wants to sue and where; second, the court’s desire to prevent a plaintiff from circumventing the operation of an arbitration clause; and third, the court’s inherent power to manage its processes to prevent an abuse of process and ensure the efficient and fair resolution of disputes. The balance that is struck must ultimately serve the ends of justice. In this regard, we consider that the court’s discretion to stay court proceedings pending the resolution of a related arbitration, at the request of parties who are not subject to the arbitration agreement in question, can in turn be made subject to the agreement of those parties to be bound by any applicable findings that may be made by the arbitral tribunal. We also think that the set of factors considered by Venning J in _Danone v Fonterra_ (at \[179\]–\[180\] above) offers a comprehensive (although by no means exhaustive) and instructive guide for courts faced with the scenario of overlap described at \[140\] above.

61     The factors considered by Venning J in _Danone Asia Pacific Holdings Pte Ltd v Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited_ \[2014\] NZHC 1681 (“_Danone_”), also referred to as the _Danone_ factors, are the following: (a) the relationship between the parties to the court proceedings and the parties to the arbitration; (b) the claims in the court proceedings and those in the arbitration, and the respective issues which they raised; (c) issue estoppel; (d) the risk of inconsistent findings between the two sets of proceedings; (e) the risk of delay; and (f) cost: _Tomolugen_ at \[179\].

62     In _Rex International Holding Ltd and anor v Gulf Hibiscus Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 682</span> (“_Rex_”), the Court of Appeal commented further on the situations when a case management stay may arise (at \[9\] and \[11\]):

> 9    …A claimant has the right to choose its cause of action and to sue the party it wishes to sue, in whichever forum it wishes, subject only to any applicable legal constraint, such as an arbitration agreement: \[_Tomolugen\]_ at \[187\]. While this is not an absolute right, it is nonetheless a fundamental one. Its derogation should only be countenanced if the facts properly give rise to other higher-order concerns that warrant such derogation.

> …

> 11    The question of case management arises where there are overlapping issues that will have to be ventilated before different fora among different parties, some of whom are bound by an arbitration agreement, while others are not. The typical case would be one where there is: (a) some overlap in the **_parties_** to the putative arbitration and the parties to the suit; and (b) some overlap in the **_issues_** that will be engaged in the putative arbitration and those in the suit. At times, the issue may be complicated where there is an underlap in the **_remedies_** that the putative arbitral tribunal may grant as compared to those which the court may grant as was noted in _Tomolugen_ at \[140\]. The short point is that in order for case management concerns to be relevant at all, there must first be the existence or at least the imminence of separate legal proceedings giving rise to a real risk of overlapping issues. Until such time, it would be premature to consider, let alone grant, a case management stay. We emphasise that when considering whether to grant a case management stay, it is critically important that the court apply its mind to appreciate the nature and extent of the overlaps between the putative arbitration and the court proceedings. Otherwise, the court may find itself, as it did here, ordering a case management stay for no good reason, because it has been distracted by some abstract notion of potential or theoretical overlapping of issues, parties or proceedings. It is, of course, always conceivable that there might appear to be a potential for some sort of overlap where common events involve several different parties. But a court should not stop there. Instead, it must go further and examine precisely which are: (a) the potential fora for the resolution of the dispute; (b) the different parties before each forum; and (c) the issues to be determined before each such forum. The sort of overlap that would attract a case management stay is one where the proper ventilation of the issues in the court proceedings _depended on_ the resolution of the related putative arbitration. In such circumstances, a case management stay would be needed in order to achieve the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole: _Tomolugen_ at \[186\].

63     In both _Tomolugen_ and _Rex_, the plaintiff was a party to the arbitration clause and the issue was whether its claims (whether in whole or in part) were subject to a case management stay. Can a case management stay be sought against a _non-party_ to the arbitration clause? It appears that a stay can still be sought and granted, even against a non-party, so long as it is necessary to serve the ends of justice: see _Trinity Construction Development Pte Ltd v Sinohyndro Corp Ltd (Singapore Branch)_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 215</span> at \[40\] to \[42\] (“_Trinity_”).

#### Whether arbitration proceedings had commenced

64     I first deal with a preliminary point raised by the Plaintiff, which was that no arbitration proceedings were afoot. The Plaintiff relied on the following closing lines of the order of the High Court of Delhi (referred to at \[16\] above):

> Needless to say, the pendency of this petition would not come in the way of parties coming to a consensus regarding appointment of the learned sole arbitrator to arbitrate on the disputes, **and in initiating arbitration proceedings**. \[emphasis in bold added\]

65     The Plaintiff argued that the lines in bold suggested that arbitration proceedings had not been initiated. The Defendant however argued otherwise, relying on Section 21 of the IAC Act which states:

> **21**.     **Commencement of arbitral proceedings.**–Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular disputes commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent.

66     The closing paragraph of the Legal Notice was as follows:

> In case you Noticees fail to comply with the aforementioned requisitions and reimburse the loss caused to the \[Defendant\] and direct financial loss caused to our clients \[BFPL India\]/\[BFPL SG\] within 30 days from the date of issuance of this notice, then upon expiry of the said period of 30 days, the present Notice shall, for all intents and purposes, be treated as a 30 days Notice of Arbitration in conformity with Clause 47 of the \[JVA\] and the \[IAC Act\], as amended up to date invoking arbitration. It is proposed to refer all the disputes between our clients and you Noticees to the arbitration of a Sole Arbitrator namely Justice G.S. Sistani, Retired Judge of the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in accordance with Clause 47 of the \[JVA\] and the provisions of the \[IAC Act\], as amended up to date…

67     The Defendant therefore argued that the Legal Notice contained a request for the disputes to be referred to arbitration, pursuant to the JVA, and since the respondents have received the Legal Notice, arbitration proceedings have commenced, pursuant to Section 21 of the IAC Act.

68     I agree with the Defendant. In my view, the requirements under Section 21 of the IAC Act had been complied with and arbitration proceedings had commenced. As for the closing lines of the order of the High Court of Delhi, the issue of whether or not arbitration proceedings had commenced was not before the High Court of Delhi and as such I would hesitate to rely on those lines as making any determinative finding on such an issue.

#### Whether a case management stay should be granted

69     I start by reiterating the court’s task when faced with a request for a case management stay. As the Court of Appeal in _Tomolugen_ explained, the court’s task is to strike a balance between three higher-order concerns: first, a plaintiff’s right to choose whom he wants to sue and where; second, the court’s desire to prevent a plaintiff from circumventing the operation of an arbitration clause; and third, the court’s inherent power to manage its processes to prevent an abuse of process and ensure the efficient and fair resolution of disputes. Of these three higher-order concerns, only the first and the third are applicable here. The second does not apply since the Plaintiff is not a party to the arbitration clause. For the third, there is no abuse of process but the issue of the efficient and fair resolution of disputes does arise, which I turn to.

70     I first consider whether there is an overlap between the parties in the Suit and those in arbitration proceedings. In my view, the overlap is minimal. I say this for the following reasons:

> (a)     The claimants (BFPL India and BFPL SG) commenced the arbitration against the respondents, namely, FCPL, the Plaintiff and the Defendant. To be consistent with my findings above, I must necessarily proceed on the basis that the Plaintiff is not properly a party to the arbitration.

> (b)     Superficially, there is an overlap in that the Defendant is a party in both the Suit and the arbitration. However, I do not think the Defendant will participate substantively in the arbitration. In my view, the Defendant should properly be a claimant, rather than a respondent in the arbitration. This is because the breaches of the JVA alleged by the claimants would have caused damage to the Defendant. Notwithstanding this, the claimants (who control the Defendant) chose not to make the Defendant a claimant in the arbitration.

> (c)     That the Defendant is not likely to participate substantively in the arbitration is somewhat confirmed by the fact that the Legal Notice issued by the claimants asserts breaches by FCPL and the Plaintiff, and seeks reliefs against them, rather than against the Defendant. This is not surprising given that the dispute in the arbitration is essentially a joint venture dispute between shareholders.

> (d)     Since the Defendant is not likely to participate substantively in the arbitration, the fact that it is a common party in both the Suit and the arbitration is not a strong factor pointing to a case management stay.

71     I then consider whether there is an overlap of issues. The Defendant argued that the following issues (amongst others) are the subject of the arbitration:

> (a)     Unauthorised withdrawals by FCPL that were orchestrated by the Plaintiff;

> (b)     Unauthorised withdrawals by the Plaintiff under the guise of salary payments;

> (c)     Unauthorised payments to a creditor of the Defendant;

> (d)     Unauthorised salary increments given to the Defendant’s employees by the Plaintiff;

> (e)     The failure to keep proper records of the Defendant’s stocks; and

> (f)     The failure to properly maintain the books and accounts of the Defendant.

72     Whilst the arbitration encompasses a large variety of issues, the issue in the Suit however is a fairly narrow one and is only one of the issues raised in the arbitration (Issue (b) in the list above). The overlap of issues is therefore not significant.

73     I consider that the issue of delay pointed against the grant of a case management stay. Realistically, the arbitration will take at least one to two years to complete. If the Suit was stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration, the Suit would be significantly delayed.

74     Finally, I consider the risk of inconsistent findings. If the Suit proceeds, the court will likely refer to and interpret the JVA. This could give rise to a risk of inconsistent findings on the interpretation of the JVA between the court and the arbitral tribunal. This risk can however be mitigated or ameliorated if the claimants in the arbitration choose not to pursue the claims in relation to the Plaintiff’s entitlement to a salary in the arbitration, and leave the issue, which I consider to be a discrete one that can be severed from the arbitration, to be decided in the Suit. Since the claimants are in control of the Defendant, all the arguments that they wish to make in the arbitration can be made in the Suit through the Defendant’s defence. Although I am unable to direct the claimants to take this approach, I consider it to be a reasonable way to mitigate any risk of inconsistent decisions.

75     In any event, even if the risk of inconsistent decisions remained, that has to be balanced against the factors pointing against a stay – namely, the Plaintiff’s right to choose whom and where he wants to sue; there was minimal overlap in parties and issues; the Defendant was not likely to participate substantively in the arbitration; a stay would delay the resolution of the Suit quite significantly; the issue of the Plaintiff’s entitlement to his salary is a discrete issue which can be severed from the arbitration if necessary; and that any risk of inconsistent decisions could be ameliorated or mitigated by the actions taken by the Defendant, BFPL India and BFPL SG.

76     Therefore, balancing the various factors for and against a case management stay, I conclude that it would not serve the ends of justice to grant the stay.

77     Finally, I also looked at the cases of _Tomolugen_, _Danone_ and _Trinity_, cases where a case management stay was granted, to get a sense of the nature of cases which would attract a case management stay. I thought this was a useful exercise given that in trying to balance the various factors to decide whether a case management stay was warranted, it is not altogether clear if any one factor is more important than the other. For example, it is just a “numbers” game, and if a majority of the _Danone_ factors pointed for or against a case management stay, that would resolve the issue? Or are some factors more weighty than others, such that if the more weighty factors pointed for or against a case management stay, that would be decisive?

78     In _Tomolugen_, the plaintiff Silica Investors sought relief under Section 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) for oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct towards it as a minority shareholder. The defendants in the Suit included the company of which Silica Investors was a minority shareholder, AMRG, other shareholders of AMRG and current or former directors of AMRG or its related companies. A number of allegations were made against the defendants, including one referred to as the Management Participation Allegation. One of the defendants was Lionsgate, who sought a stay under Section 6 of the IAA pursuant to the arbitration clause in the share sale agreement between itself and Silica Investors.

79     The Court of Appeal held that the Management Participation Allegation was caught by the arbitration clause and a stay was mandated. However, the other allegations were not, and furthermore the other defendants apart from Lionsgate were not parties to the arbitration clause. At \[190\] of _Tomolugen_, the Court of Appeal issued a series of directions as to how the various claims should be managed. In essence, the Silica Investors were given the option of forgoing the Management Participation Allegation against Lionsgate. If they chose to do so, then no stay would be granted, but it would also mean that they would not be able to rely on the Management Participation Allegation against the remaining defendants.

80     If Silica Investors wanted to pursue the Management Participation Allegation against Lionsgate, the court proceedings in respect of that allegation would be stayed based on Section 6 of the IAA, and the remaining allegations against Lionsgate would also be stayed pursuant to the court’s case management powers. Silica Investors was to consider offering to arbitrate the Management Participation Allegations against the rest of the defendants before the same tribunal. Because the Management Participation was a fairly narrow issue which was subsidiary in importance to the other issues and allegations in the suit, the Court of Appeal expected the arbitration to proceed expeditiously, and if possible, by means of any expedited procedures available. In any event, if the resolution of the arbitration was unduly delayed, any party to the arbitration may apply to court for the stay to be lifted. If the Management Participation Allegation against Lionsgate is arbitrated, whether with or without the participation of the remaining defendants, the rest of the court proceedings in the suit would be stayed pursuant to the court’s case management powers.

81     In my view, an important consideration in the way Court of Appeal decided how the disputes in _Tomolugen_ were to be managed, was the fact that the plaintiff, Silica Investors, was bound by an arbitration clause and at least part of the dispute had to be submitted to arbitration. Consequently, any objection from the plaintiff that its right to litigate was being curtailed through the case management stay was less compelling. Indeed, the Court of Appeal appeared to suggest that in balancing the various higher order concerns, one of which was a party’s right to choose whom he wants to sue and where, the balance may be struck differently depending on whether the plaintiff was or was not bound to an arbitration clause. At \[187\], the Court of Appeal said:

> We recognise that a plaintiff’s right to sue whoever he wants and where he wants is a fundamental one. But, that right is not absolute. It is restrained only to a modest extent when the plaintiff’s claim is stayed temporarily pending the resolution of a related arbitration, as opposed to when the plaintiff’s claim is shut out in its entirety... **In appropriate cases, that right may be curtailed or may even be regarded as subsidiary to holding the plaintiff to his obligation to arbitrate where he has agreed to do so. The strength of the plaintiff’s right of timely access to the court will therefore vary depending on the facts of each case. In a situation where there are multiple plaintiffs, some of whom are not bound to arbitrate (as in** **_Danone v Fonterra_** **(\[175\] ****_supra_****)), staying the court proceedings may result in a greater derogation from this right for those plaintiffs who are not bound by the arbitration clause. But, that is not a concern for us in the present appeals because Silica Investors is the ****_sole plaintiff_**** in the Suit and is ****_bound to arbitrate_**** at least one of the issues that it intends to rely on in the court proceedings against Lionsgate and the remaining defendants (namely, the Management Participation Allegation). The presence of the obligation to arbitrate this allegation diminishes the force of any objection that Silica Investors may raise that its right of timely access to the court is being undermined.** \[emphasis in bold added\]

82     In _Danone_, eight plaintiffs (who were all part of the Danone group of companies) had commenced arbitration proceedings against Fonterra Limited and Fonterra Australia. The dispute arose out of a supply agreement between only one of the plaintiffs and Fonterra Limited. The claims were in contract and tort (and in particular for false representations about the safety of a product), and there were also statutory claims for misleading and deceptive practices.

83     The eight plaintiffs then commenced proceedings in the New Zealand High Court against Fonterra Limited’s parent company, FCGL. The eight plaintiffs contended that the persons who made the false representations on behalf of Fonterra Limited had been employed by FCGL at the material time and FCGL was therefore vicariously liable. There were claims against FCGL in negligence and deceptive and misleading conduct, as well as statutory claims for misleading representations. The heads of damages and amount claimed by the eight plaintiffs in the court proceedings and arbitration were exactly the same.

84     FCGL applied for a case management stay and this was granted by Venning J, for a number of reasons which included the following (_Tomolugen_ at \[180\]):

> (a)     The claims in the court proceedings were effectively derivative from, and subsidiary to, the claims being pursued in the arbitration;

> (b)     There was a significant overlap between the factual basis underlying the claim in the arbitration and the court proceedings and also the legal issues that will arise in both;

> (c)     The claimants were the same in both the arbitration and the court proceedings;

> (d)     There was a practical risk of inconsistent findings of fact and law between the court proceedings and the arbitration, given the overlap between the facts and legal issues in the two sets of proceedings; and

> (e)     There would be a duplication of witnesses and evidence between the arbitration and the court proceedings.

85      _Trinity_ was a rather unique case in that the plaintiff filed duplicate proceedings in court in response to the defendant’s jurisdictional objection to the arbitration on the basis that there was no arbitration agreement between parties. The plaintiff was at all times prepared to proceed with the arbitration but was concerned that if the tribunal made an adverse ruling, it would be left with no relief because its claim was time-barred. It therefore filed duplicate proceedings in court. The defendant sought a striking out of the suit, but in the alternative a case management stay. The court declined to strike out the suit but ordered a case management stay instead. The court noted the following factors pointed towards the grant of a case management stay: the fact that the plaintiff had always been willing to arbitrate, the parties in the arbitration and court proceedings were identical, the claims were duplicated, there was a risk of inconsistent findings, and there was increased costs owing to potential duplication of witnesses and evidence.

86     The facts of _Tomolugen_, _Danone_ and _Trinity_ are of course very different from the facts here. That alone does not mean that a case management stay should not be granted. As the Court of Appeal in _Tomolugen_ explained, a case management stay should be granted if it served the ends of justice. However, I consider that the facts of those three cases gives a sense as to the circumstances when a case management stay is warranted. Where part of the dispute was caught by an arbitration clause to which the plaintiff was a party, this is likely to be a strong factor pointing to a case management stay, even if a significant part of the dispute was not caught by the arbitration clause and a number of other parties in the court proceedings were not parties to the arbitration clause. This was the case in _Tomolugen_. And where there was significant overlap in parties, issues, and claims between the court proceedings and the arbitration, all of which would naturally lead to a duplication of witnesses and evidence and a risk of inconsistent findings, this pointed to a grant of a case management stay. This was the case in _Danone_ and _Trinity_.

87     None of these circumstances are present here, and this further buttresses my conclusion that a case management stay would not serve the ends of justice.

## Conclusion

88     The Defendant has failed to establish a _prima facie_ case that the Plaintiff is bound to the arbitration clause in the JVA, on any of the grounds put forward. Additionally, I did not consider that a case management stay served the ends of justice. Consequently, I dismiss the stay application, with costs payable to the Plaintiff.
