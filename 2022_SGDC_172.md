### District Judge Brenda Chua:

## Introduction

1       Zhu Yu, the accused person, pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> **DAC-921531-2020**

> You…are charged that, you, sometime on or before 21 October 2020, in Singapore, did abet the commission of the offence of carrying on a business of providing payment service in Singapore by engaging in a conspiracy with one “Raymond”, which offence was not committed in consequence of your abetment, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, to wit, you were present at 7 Claymore Road, Singapore on behalf of Raymond to facilitate the physical meeting between Lin Chun Yan (“Lin”), Lin Wei Keong and Kelvin Yap Qi Hao to effect a money-changing service to exchange RMB to SGD for Lin, when Raymond did not have in force a licence that entitles him to do so and was not an exempt payment service provider, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1) and punishable under section 5(3)(a) of the Payment Services Act 2019 read with section 116 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Facts

2       The accused, a 27-year-old male Singapore citizen, admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification. In the Statement of Facts:

> (a)     Lincoln Poh Chong Tee and Raymond (who was based in Vietnam and currently at large) hatched a money-changing service scam. The scam involved converting Renminbi (“RMB”) to Singapore dollars (“SGD”) worth SGD150,000. Once the victim transferred the money to be exchanged, they would lie to the victim that they had not received the money and keep it;

> (b)     Raymond roped in the accused to participate in the scam, on the promise of commission expected to be about SGD1,000 to SGD3,000;

> (c)     The accused was aware that his role was to ensure that the money exchange transaction went smoothly, and the parties did not undercut Raymond. While Raymond did not specify the precise amount, the accused was aware from deals where he previously assisted Raymond that this was in the range of SGD100,000 to SGD200,000;

> (d)     On 21 October 2020, the accused met Lin Wei Keong and Kelvin Yap Qi Hao (“the two men”) who had SGD150,000 in cash with them. The accused brought them to a basement carpark, where Lin Chun Yan and Ong Mun Chuan (“Ong”) waited. The accused witnessed the counting of cash from about three to four metres away, and heard that the value amounted to SGD150,000;

> (e)     Lin Chun Yan transferred half of the agreed amount in RMB to two bank accounts given to her by Raymond. She did not make further transfers after the two men refused to hand her any cash. The two men then ran out of the carpark with the cash. The accused did not give chase and left. Ong called the police, who arrested the two men and seized the cash of SGD150,000; and

> (f)     The accused deleted his Whatsapp chats with Raymond and other chats which might hint at his involvement in the money exchange transactions, as he suspected they were illegal.

## The prosecution’s submission on sentence

3       The prosecution submitted that an imprisonment term of five to six weeks should be imposed. The prosecution cited _Public Prosecutor v Lange Vivian_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 11</span> (“_Lange Vivian_”) and set out these reasons:

> (a)      Public interest. Where offences affect the delivery of financial services and the integrity of the economic infrastructure, general deterrence assumed significance as a sentencing consideration.

>> (i)       It was stated in _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ \[2007\] SLR(R) 814 (at \[24(e)\]) that “\[t\]he public interest vested in a secure and reliable financial system that facilitates convenient commercial transactions is extraordinary, especially in light of Singapore’s reputation as an internationally respected financial, commercial and investment hub…The courts will take an uncompromising stance in meting out severe sentences to offences in this category”;

>> (ii)       It was also stated in _Lange Vivian_ (at \[21\]) that the legislative intent behind the Payment Services Act 2019 (“the Act”) was to address “increased risks of money laundering and terrorism financing”. Such unregulated transactions inevitably present such risks;

> (b)      Role of the accused. Given that such transactions were inherently risky as they occurred outside the bounds of regulatory safeguards and often between complete strangers, the accused’s presence provided necessary security and assurance for the transaction to take place, since Raymond was overseas; and

> (c)      Other factors. The transaction was conducted in a basement carpark. While there was no evidence of criminal proceeds, such transactions were profitable and difficult to detect.

4       For the offence-specific factors, the prosecution submitted that (a) the total transaction value was high; (b) there were hierarchical layers where the first layer comprised the mastermind and the next layer comprised the accused as the trusted person on the ground to execute the transaction; and (c) there was a transnational element involving overseas bank accounts and foreign elements.

5       For the offender-specific factors, the prosecution submitted that the accused was aware that this was a pre-arranged transaction where he would expect to earn SGD1,000 to SGD3,000. The accused also suspected that the transaction was illegal.

## Mitigation

6       The defence submitted that an imprisonment term of not more than three weeks would be appropriate. The accused was untraced, pleaded guilty and cooperated with the authorities.

7       The defence cited _Lange Vivian_. For factors going towards culpability, the defence submitted that first, the accused was not involved in any premeditation or planning as his role was limited to being present to facilitate the transfer. Second, no sophisticated means were used to execute the transaction. Third, the accused did not earn any commission or profit. Fourth, the accused had no knowledge that the transaction was a scam until the two men fled the scene.

8       For factors going towards harm, the defence stated that:

> (a)     None of the money was dissipated as the SGD150,000 cash was recovered. The accused did not know the quantum until he witnessed the transaction, although he admitted to facilitating past transactions for Raymond ranging from SGD100,000 to SGD200,000;

> (b)     There was no evidence of criminal proceeds, unlike in _Lange Vivian_ where a sum of SGD2,200 was ascertained to be criminal proceeds. Whilst the defence stated that “the more crucial consideration was the fact that the funds were tainted” (see _Lange Vivian_ at \[24\]), the defence acknowledged that the amount in this case was large and such offences were difficult to detect; and

> (c)     Although the transaction took place domestically with the parties physically present, the defence conceded that there was a transnational element with the online transfer of money and instructions originating from Vietnam. In addition, as the accused only communicated with Raymond, the accused did not know that a syndicate was involved.

## The court’s decision

9       The Act provides for the licensing and regulation of payment service providers and the oversight of payment systems. With the proliferation of scams in Singapore, there is a public interest element in safeguarding our country’s financial stability and efficiency. It is imperative to take a strong stance against offenders who circumvent the Act’s licensing and regulatory requirements. There is therefore a need for general deterrence for offences of this nature.

10     The prosecution and the defence relied on _Lange Vivian_. As I found the sentencing factors in _Lange Vivian_ relevant to the present case, I reproduce them below:

11     For the offence-specific factors going towards harm, the transaction was for SGD150,000, which is a significant amount. This figure is _54 times_ the amount involved in _Lange Vivian_. A higher transaction value would erode trust in the payment services infrastructure to a greater degree. A syndicate’s involvement represented a higher degree of harm as there was a collective and group element. The fact that the accused previously assisted Raymond in deals meant that similar transactions might have been carried out but were undetected – this reinforced the point that such offences were difficult to detect. Although the SGD150,000 cash was recovered, this was not due to the accused’s efforts. Further, half of the agreed amount which Lin Chun Yan transferred in RMB to the bank accounts given by Raymond has _not_ been recovered.

12     The Act is “concerned with preventing an unregulated shadow financial system, irrespective of whether criminal proceeds are involved or not”: _Lange Vivian_ at \[14\]. The prosecution and the defence agreed that whilst there were no criminal proceeds, a transnational element was present as the accused was executing instructions from overseas and money was transferred online to overseas bank accounts. Offences with a transnational element are more serious as they encompass law enforcement issues (in this case, Raymond was still at large) and the use of Singapore by overseas masterminds as a target destination to commit the offences. Similarly, there was a transnational element in _Lange Vivian_ where the offender took instructions from abroad.

13     For the offence-specific factors going towards culpability, I noted that the accused did not plan the transaction and facilitated it on Raymond’s instructions. In _Lange Vivian_ (at \[27\]), it was stated that “while the accused did not come up with the elaborate plan, she had played a critical role in the scheme of things”. In this case, the accused was instrumental in facilitating the transaction by meeting the parties in person and bringing the parties together. By the accused’s admission, he was motivated by the commission of SGD1,000 to SGD3,000 which was a substantially higher commission than that in _Lange Vivian_.

14     In terms of sophistication, the scheme was complex, systematic, elaborate, and well planned. A considerable amount of SGD notes was used as a ruse and to create credibility, the accused and the two men played different and distinct roles, and the two men were tasked to bring the cash and to flee with the cash.

15     It was noteworthy that the accused deleted his Whatsapp chats with Raymond as he suspected that the money exchange transaction was illegal. Significantly and inexcusably, taking active steps to conceal and avoid detection was a factor warranting a more severe sentence.

16     For the offender-specific mitigating factors, the accused was untraced, pleaded guilty and cooperated with investigations. No offender-specific aggravating factors appeared present here.

## Conclusion

17     Having considered the facts of the case, the prosecution’s submission on sentence and the defence’s submission on mitigation, I imposed an imprisonment term of five weeks.
