2       The prescribed punishment for each of the charges was up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The accused person was also liable to a fine.

3       At the end of the trial, I found the accused person guilty and convicted him of all 8 charges.

4       The accused person had no antecedents and I sentenced him to a global sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment.

5       I allowed the accused person’s request to defer his sentence to 18 November 2019 and released him on bail. On 15 November 2019, the accused person filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. On 18 November 2019, I allowed bail pending appeal.

## Prosecution’s case

6       The prosecution had called the following witnesses to establish its case:

#### Evidence of Rashid - C1, C2 and C3

7       Rashid testified that he was first acquainted with the accused person in polytechnic in 2006 and he became best friends with the accused person when they met each other again during national service days.

8       Sometime in 2014, after they had completed national service, the accused person told Rashid that he was working as a trader for a company called “Varius Evans” and introduced Rashid to “the world of trading and investing”.[^1] According to Rashid, the accused person was “always dressed nicely, smart attire, carrying a briefcase. And a few times, \[the accused person\] showed \[Rashid\] … stacks of cash like 50s and 100s.” The accused person also gave details of his office, relationship with his colleagues and how profitable “Varius Evans” was.[^2]

9       On 22 June 2014,[^3] the accused person sent a message on the Whatsapp Messenger communication application (“**Whatsapp**”) to ask Rashid if wanted to invest in some oil stocks, purportedly “a very safe trade investment”, with “Varius Evans” through the accused person and his colleagues. The accused person informed Rashid that the amount of investment was $10,000 and Rashid would earn a profit of $3,100 at the end of 3 months.[^4] The accused person gave Rashid an hour to decide whether to invest as the company “needed to close the accounts quickly or soon, so they can start trading.”.[^5]

10     Rashid thought that it was a “safe and sure way… to get some money” and agreed to invest with “Varius Evans” through the accused person (the “**1**st**Investment**”).[^6] As Rashid did not have $10,000 with him at that time, the accused person informed Rashid that he will “get his colleague to put in the money for \[Rashid\] first”. Thereafter, Rashid obtained a loan from his mother, Takako Tomizawa, who transferred $10,000 from her POSB Bank account to the Bank Account the next day, _ie._ 23 June 2014.[^7] This transfer was documented in a POSB Bank withdrawal slip dated 23 June 2014.[^8]R

11     Rashid checked with the accused person in September or October 2014 when Rashid did not receive his returns from the 1st Investment more than 3 months’ later. The accused person told Rashid that there was “a bank delay” as the company had to “finish and closed (_sic_) their account”.[^9] The accused person also told Rashid that here was a “bank audit”.[^10]

12     On 22 October 2014, the accused person again asked Rashid to invest with “Varius Evans” through him. In court, Rashid recalled that the new investment was for a period of less than 1 year. Rashid agreed to invest $20,000 with Rashid (the “**2**nd**Investment**”) as he was “happy with the progress of \[the 1st Investment\] and it came across to \[Rashid\] that it was really safe and secure”. The accused person gave Rashid an hour to confirm if he wanted to make the investment as “the company will be closing their account, soon to be---soon to be traded”.[^11]

13     Rashid was prepared to make the 2nd Investment even though he had not received the proceeds from the 1st Investment as he believed that the delay was not the fault of the accused person or “Varius Evans”:[^12]

>   
| 

A

 | 

According to him \[_ie._ the accused person\], the funds from the 1st investment were out his company and close their account. And the delay was due to bank processing. And eventually, it would add on to, uh, bank audit.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, why would that make you invest with him a second time?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Because I did not see the delay as his fault or his company’s fault.

 |

  
  

14     For the second time, Rashid turned to his mother for a loan for the 2nd Investment. On 23 October 2014, Rashid went with his mother to the DBS Bank branch at Raffles City Shopping Centre where his mother withdrew $20,000 from her POSB Bank account and deposited the same into the Bank Account.[^13] The withdrawal and deposit were documented in a DBS Bank withdrawal transaction receipt[^14] and a DBS Bank deposit transaction receipt[^15], respectively, both of which were dated 23 October 2014. Thereafter, the accused informed Rashid that he had received the money and that “it was good to be traded with”.[^16]

15     After the 2nd Investment was made, the accused person periodically updated Rashid on the Facebook Messenger communication application (“**Facebook Messenger**”) on the progress of the 2nd Investment and the reasons for the delay in the return of the capital and profit from the 1st Investment (the “**Messenger Log**”).[^17]

16     An extract of the Messenger Log and Rashid’s corresponding testimony in court, from the Prosecution’s closing submissions,[^18] is reproduced below:

17     By September 2015, Rashid still had not received any returns from the 1st Investment and the 2nd Investment. Nevertheless, the accused person contacted Rashid on Facebook Messenger on 28 November 2015 to ask him to make yet another investment (the “**3**rd**Investment**”):[^25]

> supp you wanna do a personal investment with all of my colleagues? **it’s just 1 week of trades. we’re estimating returns of at least 32 percent.** that’s a modest estimate as you can tell. that’s the returns that I can promise you ah. we’ll log in our trades at 7pm today and start trading from monday to saturday morning. we’ve raised 3 million dollars from my colleagues and from my company. We’re doing this twice a year whereby everyone pool their money for a short time. Don’t care about how small or big the amount is but of course, if it’s a big amount, you feel the rewards but whatever it is, i think you should go for it! small investment will do too! **haha i mean you already have 2 portfolios with my company. haha let me know! you can grow your money without any risk and you’ll get it back v fast too.**

> (Emphasis added.)

18     Notably, the accused person had also referred to the 1st Investment and the 2nd Investment in the same message.

19     Rashid understood that the 3rd Investment was for a period of 1 week. However, it would take up to 9 working days for him to receive the returns.[^26] As with 1st Investment and 2nd Investment, the accused person gave Rashid an hour to decide whether to participate in the 3rd Investment.[^27]

20     Rashid decided to invest $5,000 in the 3rd Investment but told the accused person that he could only make a payment of $3,000 that day, _ie._28 November 2015, due to a $3,000 withdrawal limit on his bank account, and the balance of $2,000 the next day.[^28]

21     Accordingly, Rashid transferred $3,000 to the Bank Account on 28 November 2015 at 7:03 pm and a further $2,000 after midnight, _ie._ on 29 November 2015, at 2:09 am.[^29] The funds transfers were confirmed by way of a letter dated 15 February 2017 from DBS Bank to Rashid.[^30]

22     After Rashid invested in the 3rd Investment, he continued to correspond with the accused person on Facebook Messenger and periodically checked with the accused person on the status and the promised returns on the investments. However, the accused person was slow to respond and continued to give many reasons why the returns were not forthcoming.[^31]

23     By January 2017, about 2½ years after the 1st Investment and 1¼ year after the 3rd Investment, Rashid still had not received any returns on all three investments. Rashid started to feel that something was wrong when the accused person “started to play the disappearing game like… he wouldn’t be contactable”.[^32] As the accused person had previously informed Rashid that some of their mutual friends had also invested with him, Rashid decided to reach out to them to find out if they were in a similar situation.[^33]

24     Rashid contacted Farahyn and her husband and found out that Farahyn had similarly invested money with the accused person and the accused person had not paid her any returns from her investment. The reasons that the accused person gave to Farahyn for the delay were similar to the reasons that the accused person had given to Rashid.[^34] Rashid “felt heartbroken” when he heard this “\[b\]ecause more or less, it kind of confirm thatt something was amiss”.[^35] Subsequently, Rashid also found out from Farahyn that her friend, Naziehah, had also invested in “Varius Evans”.

25     On 25 June 2017, Rashid filed the following police report at the Bedok Police Division:[^36]

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image2.png)

26     Rashid never received any returns (_ie._ capital and/or profit) from the accused person for the 1st Investment, the 2nd Investment and the 3rd Investment.

27     For all 3 investments, Rashid testified that he would not have given the monies to the accused person to invest if he had known that the accused person did not have the intention or the ability to help him invest with the trading company that the accused person was purportedly working for, _ie._ “Varius Evans”, which was not true.[^37]

#### Evidence of Farahyn - C4

28     Farahyn was acquainted with the accused person through her husband, Abdul Haliim Khan s/o Mohamed Hapiz Khan (“**Haliim**”), at the polytechnic and had known the accused person for about a decade as at February 2019. Farahyn became closer to the accused person in 2014 or 2015.[^38]

29     Sometime in January 2016, while the Farahyn and the accused were communicating with each other on Whatsapp, the accused person mentioned that he was already a millionaire and that he had given Farahyn’s cousin money for his wedding.[^39] Farahyn then asked the accused for advice on how to invest. The accused person told her that he had been working with “Varius Evans” as a trader since 2015. According to Farahyn, the accused person came across as knowledgeable about investments:[^40]

Q

 | 

So from your interactions with Fayyadz, what was your impression about Fayyadz in terms of his involvement in investment?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He seemed like a very knowledgeable guy. Um, he certainly, un, did know the jargon of trading. Something which I’m not very well-versed in. Um, and he came off as genuine---as a genuine trader.

30     As the accused person continued to expound his knowledge and success in investments, Farahyn asked the accused person whether she could pass him her money and let him “handle it” for her[^41] The following is the relevant extract of the Whatsapp communication between Farahyn and the accused person:[^42]

33     Farahyn understood that her investment would be made together with the company’s account.[^45]

34     The accused person told Farahyn that there would be no paperwork as her investment would be amalgamated with his so that there would be no need to pay commission to the company, and that the investment would close on 27 March 2016 and the returns would be forthcoming about 9 days thereafter:[^46]

35     Farahyn discussed the matter with Haliim and decided to go ahead with the investment. On 28 January 2016, Farahyn transferred $10,000 to the Bank Account and sent a screenshot of the money transfer to the accused person.[^47]

36     Farahyn also told her best friend, Syafiqah, about the investment opportunity that the accused person had offered to her.[^48] Syafiqah expressed interest in investing $1,000 with the accused person as well. As such, Farayhn called the accused person to ask whether Syafiqah could participate in the investment. The accused person’s response was positive:[^49]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

What did you discuss---what did you talk to Fayyadz about in that phone call?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I told her, I asked him whether it’s okay if others wanted to invest as well, namely Syafiqah. And he said, “It’s okay.” Therefore, I went to ask her whether she would like to invest as well.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And what was Fayyadz’s reply when you said that she wants to put in 1K?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He said that, “Tell her she would get back minimum 1.2K.”

 |

  
  

37     Consequently, Farahyn provided Syafiqah with the Bank Account details and asked Syafiqah to transfer $1,000 directly to the Bank Account and provide a screenshot of the transaction record. Syafiqah transferred the money accordingly and sent the screenshot of the transaction record to Farahyn. The correspondence between Farahyn and Syafiqah was documented in the following extract of Farahyn’s Whatsapp communication with Syafiqah:[^50]

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image3.png)

38     Farahyn forwarded Syafiqah’s screenshot of the online transaction record to the accused person on 29 January 2016 at 9:23:53 pm.[^51]

39     Shortly after Farahyn and Syafiqah had made their payments to the accused person, Farahyn asked the accused person for an update on the investment. The accused person replied that the investment had yielded a profit:[^52]

40     Thereafter, the accused person continued to periodically update Farahyn on the performance of the investment. The updates were generally positive and the accused person subsequently told Farahyn that he was not going to close the investment at the end of 2 months as there was still room for growth. The following is a summary of the periodic updates from the accused person and Farahyn’s oral testimony in court, adapted from the Prosecutions closing submissions:[^53]

41     Over time, Farahyn became concerned about the accused person’s delay in closing the investment and paying her the returns. However, the accused person was always ready with reasons for the delay, for instance:[^60]

> Salam, apologies for the late reply. I am still not back yet though but never mind. I spoke at great lengths with my MD about everything and I mean, literally, everything. I will tell you the specifics when everything is over and when we meet but the main pointers were my utmost disappointment about my accountant's failure to keep her promise no matter how valid her reasons were and also, that it's been 1.5 weeks since the money is in our firm's hands and not everyone has received the returns which was unprecedented because during all my time working there when we received the returns, we will payout within 3 working days even if the clients were too busy to meet us, we would personally meet them at their homes or at their offices to issue them cheques. but before I go on and share with you about the steps taken, I'd like to remind you that the first delay was 2 months after the initial estimated return solely because it's a financial decision taken by my MD as our group of traders and analysts (me included) decided that there's still much more money to be made, hence, we extended the date to close our trading account as we were obligated to earn as much as possible as long as we've factored in the risks involved and it paid off handsomely. A little reminder that ALL of your money, my money, shareholders' money, clients' money, colleagues' money and the firm's money were poured into ONE single account which totalled to approximately 4.2 million dollars. With that money, we made 70.2 percent profits. When we finally decided to close the account though we could squeeze out a little more money, it took 12 working days for the firm to receive the money. My accountant assumed almost all of the responsibility in handing out cash returns for that account and also, 6 more accounts. On top of that, she had many other responsibilities as my MD wasn't around but like I said, though she had valid excuses, I am still angry because promises are something which I hold on to dearly. I am especially disappointed that after she made that promise and I told you about it. To be honest brother, I am not supposed to tell you about any potential return dates to avoid disappointments or potential suits against us because we didn't follow through on our words and being in the finance line, delays are always there. It starts right at the top from MOF to banks to small firms like ours. What I am saying is that before working in this line, I never thought about delays because I didn't see any delays before but only after having my accounts frozen for nothing, and despite later on receiving a letter from MOF to the banks to release my accounts to me immediately, I still have to wait more than 2 months before my accounts were accessible. It's bloody annoying but understandable. So, what I was so angry about was that this delay is caused by my accountant prioritising the clients before us (shareholders, colleagues). I would have done the same thing too except that I will make sure that I will settle it immediately even if it means not sleeping or working ten times harder. I hate giving excuses. But of course, she isn't me. So, I told my MD everything about what I feel and I told him that you guys needed the money for your wedding next month (haha) and he said that he would personally make sure that my accountant will prioritise bank transfers as soon as possible. From this second onwards, I am liasing with my MD and not that accountant. I know it's frustrating but that's all I could do for now. I am frustrated, angry and disappointed especially when I had to bite my tongue and borrow money from someone I used to work for because I promised HDB to settle the remaining 40k yesterday. It was humbling. But when I think about everything, perhaps that this experience is just a little tiny test or payment for us to great rewards. I will update you the second the transfer has been made. Like I told you, Banu and my account numbers have already been updated into our firm's server. I personally checked them when I dropped by to the office with my MD just now and I've also checked the status of it which showed that the returns haven't been paid to us. After all of this is over, if the both of you need to pay a little more because of the late bookings, I promise to absorb the cost of it and don't be shy or humble about it, like I said, it's the least I could do. Just tell me. I do not know anything more than what I have told you. In shaa Allah, the money will be in our hands very very very soon, that's all I pray and hope now really.

42     However, Farahyn always felt reassured whenever the accused person told her about how well the investment was doing.[^61]

43     Things changed in January 2017 when Rashid approached Farahyn and Haliim and told them that he had invested with the accused person and had not received a single cent back after a number of years. Farahyn was “shocked and very angry” to hear this.[^62]

44     Another meeting was held by Farahyn Haliim, Rashid, Rashid’s wife as well as the accused person’s ex-girlfriend and friend from polytechnic. They did some background check on “Varius Evans” and realised that its address was a mailbox and not an office, as claimed by the accused person. Subsequently, they decided to report the accused person to the police.[^63]

45     On 28 June 2017 at 00:07 hours, Farahyn’s husband filed a police report at the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters, an extract of which is as follows:[^64]

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image4.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image5.png)

46     Farahyn testified that she would not have given her money to the accused person to invest if she had known that the accused person did not have the intention or the ability to help her invest with the trading company that the accused person was purportedly working for, _ie._ “Varius Evans”, which was not true.[^65]

#### Evidence of Syafiqah - C7

47     Syafiqah was acquainted with the accused person through Farahyn in October 2015 when they had dinner together.[^66] During the dinner, the accused person told Syafiqah that he was working for a trading company and gave the impression that he was a successful and well-off investor.[^67]

48     Syafiqah testified that Farahyn called her on 29 January 2016 to inform her that the accused person was “doing the investment with a company” which offered a return of 20-30%. Syafiqah did not know the name of the company that the accused person was working for[^68] but she was drawn to returns of 20-30% that the accused person talked about and asked Farahyn if she could participate in the investment with $1,000.[^69] As such, Farahyn called the accused person to ask if Syafiqah could participate in the investment.[^70]

49     Subsequently, Farahyn told Syafiqah that the accused person had agreed to let her participate in the investment and conveyed to her that the accused person had said that Syafiqah would receive $1,200 with an investment of $1,000.[^71] Farahyn then sent the Bank Account details to Syafiqah[^72] for her to transfer $1,000.

50     Syafiqah transferred $1,000 to the Bank Account on 29 January 2016 at about 9:16 pm and sent a screenshot of the online transaction record to Farahyn.[^73]

51     Even though Syafiqah had invested directly with the accused person, she did not communicate directly with the accused person in relation to the investment or for subsequent updates. She had obtained all the information on the investment from the accused person through Farahyn, including the 3-month period for the investment.[^74]

52     Sometime in 2016, Syafiqah found out that Farahyn was having difficulty getting her money back from the accused person. Syafiqah suffered the same fate. However, she did not try to reach out to the accused person directly for repayment of her investment as she had communicated with him through Farahyn all the time. Syafiqah also did not make a police report as she knew that there was a group of victims who had already lodged police reports against the accused person. In particular, she was aware that Farahyn had filed a police report that mentioned her as a victim.[^75]

53     Syafiqah testified that she would not have given her money to the accused person to invest if she had known that the accused person did not have the intention or the ability to help her invest with the trading company which the accused person was purportedly working for, which was not true.[^76]

#### Evidence of Nasrul - C5

54     Nasrul was the accused person’s cousin. Sometime in 2016, Nasrul saw various “money quotes and everything” that the accused person had posted on his account on the Instagram social networking application (“**Instagram**”). Nasrul had the impression that the accused person was working as a trader with an trading company and asked to meet up with him to learn more about investments and trading.[^77]

55     On 24 April 2016, Nasrul met the accused person at the accused person’s void deck where the accused person impressed him with his knowledge about investments. Nasrul asked the accused person for an investment opportunity. As such, the accused person told Nasrul that he was working closely with his manager on a “particular account where small investors put up a small amount of money to share an account for about a period of 1 year which will triple … returns”. The accused person suggested that, for a small amount of $10,000, Nasrul should “put in the money for 1 year. After 1 year, \[the accused person\] would probably double or triple the amount”.[^78]

56     Nasrul understood from the accused person that he, _ie._ Nasrul, would be investing together with the trading company for which the accused person was working through the accused person’s colleague, and that the investment term was 1 year with projected returns of 2 to 3 times the capital However, the accused person did not tell Nasrul the name of his company.[^79]

57     Nasrul agreed to participate in the investment and transferred $10,000 to the Bank Account the next day, _ie._ 25 April 2016. The money transfer was documented in a DBS deposit transaction slip dated 25 April 2016 that stated the Bank Account as the destination account with the accused person’s name.[^80]

58     After Nasrul entered into the investment, he received periodic updates from the accused person _via_ Whatsapp on the performance of the investment.[^81] However, after more than a year, the accused person did not pay Nasrul the returns from his investment and kept giving reasons why the money was not forthcoming.[^82]

59     The following are extracts of the Whatsapp communication between Nasrul and the accused person[^83] and Nasrul’s corresponding testimony, as set out in the Prosecution’s closing submissions:[^84]

60     Nasrul did not have any records of his Whatsapp communication with the accused person prior to 5 June 2016 as he changed his mobile phone in May 2016.[^88]

61     Nasrul testified that he subsequently received a call from Rashid’s wife who put him in touch with a few other persons who had invested monies with the accused person and did not get their monies returns back. That was when Nasrul realised that he had been cheated by the accused person.[^89]

62     Nasrul filed a police report at Bedok Police Divisional HQ on 9 July 2017 at 13:27 hours.[^90] The following is an extract from Nasrul’s police report:

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image6.png)

63     Nasrul testified that he would not have given his money to the accused person if he had known that the accused person was not employed by any trading company.[^91]

#### Evidence of Imran - C6

64     Imran was acquainted with the accused person through a mutual friend whom they had met up a few times to talk about football. Imran was not very close to the accused person but the mutual friend had told him that the accused person was working for a trading company.[^92] As Imran wanted to grow his money, he decided to invest with the accused person in the accused person’s company:[^93]

>   
| 

A

 | 

… I told Irfaan that, um, \[the accused person\] was, um, working at a trading company, and he---I was interested in growing my money. That’s why I spoke to him more, spoke to \[the accused person\] more.

 |

  
  

65     Consequently, Imran decided to approach the accused person “about putting \[Imran’s\] money with \[the accused person\], so that he can grow \[Imran’s\] money”.[^94]

66     In May 2015, Imran obtained the accused person’s phone number from the mutual friend and sent a text message to the accused person to ask for a meeting in Bugis.[^95] During the meeting over tea, the accused person told Imran that he worked as a trader for “Varius Evans” and that he could double Imran’s investment in 6 months.[^96] According to the accused person, he would amalgamate Imran’s money with the monies of a pool of other investors with the company, and trade stocks in their respective proportions.[^97]

67     Following the meeting, Imran decided to invest $5,000, with “Varius Evans”, believing that the accused person was working as a trader with “Varius Evans”, with a view to seeing returns at the end of 6 months, _ie._ towards the end of 2015.[^98] On the same day, Imran went with the accused person to an automatic teller machine at Raffles Hospital where Imran made a transfer of $5,000 into the Bank Account with the accused person himself keying in the Bank Account details.[^99] Thereafter, the accused person would update Imran periodically on the performance of his investment.[^100]

68     In December 2015, the accused person told Imran that the funds of “Varius Evans” were frozen due to an audit by the Ministry of Finance and the Monetary Authority of Singapore and that he could not pay Imran the returns from his investment,.[^101]

69     By April 2016, the accused person still had not paid to Imran any of the returns from the investment. However, the accused person informed Imran _via_ Whatsapp on 16 April 2016 that the investment account had been closed and Imran’s investment of $5,000 had ballooned to $28,000:[^102]

> \[… Yes, I’ve closed the account. I rounded off your returns at exactly 28,000 dollars. … I will update you on Wednesday if the money is transferred to our company account or not.”

70     Thereafter, the accused person continued to stall on paying Imran his returns and gave various reasons, as set out in the following extract of a summary of the Whatsapp communication between Imran and the accused person, with Imran’s corresponding court testimony, adapted from the Prosecution’s closing submissions:[^103]

71     On 19 May 2016 at 16:09 hours, Imran sent a series of Whatsapp messages to the accused person to ask for his investment of $5,000 to be returned to him without the profits but he did not receive any reply from the accused person:[^106]

> \[19/05/2016, 4:06 PM\] Imran: Dude you got to understand

> \[19/05/2016, 4:07 PM\] Imran: Ive been waiting for almost a year

> …

> \[19/05/2016, 4:07 PM\] Imran: Ive been patient man

> \[19/05/2016, 4:07 PM\] Imran: You cant deny that

> \[19/05/2016, 4:07 PM\] Imran: In really dire situations

> \[19/05/2016, 4:08 PM\] Imran: A man needs to do what he needs to survive

> \[19/05/2016, 4:08 PM\] Imran: Im sure you understand were im coming from

> \[19/05/2016, 4:08 PM\] Imran: Look, its up to you if you want to pass me the cash

> \[19/05/2016, 4:09 PM\] Imran: Im good if you don’t pass me the profits

> \[19/05/2016, 4:09 PM\] Imran: All I badly need now is the 5k

72     The accused person replied much later when the Imran sent him another Whatsapp message the next day:[^107]

> \[20/05/2016, 9:42 PM\] Imran: Hey man so youve no intention to return me the 5k yeah?

> \[20/05/2016, 9:44 PM\] Accused person: Return? No. That 5k is your investment to our account. The 5k you’re asking is from MY own money. There’s a difference. So, wait for me to receive the funds and I will transfer you the 28k immediately.

73     Thereafter, Imran asked the accused person when he would return his money to him but the accused person gave a series of evasive responses. Eventually, Imran threatened to file a police report against the accused person:[^108]

> \[17/06/2016, 1:00 AM\] Imran: I just got off the phone with my lawyer. …for the sake of Naqib and Irfaan, I’m gonna give you an option to save you from all that might happened. Altho my lawyer advised me against meeting you to head to the police station (which he makes a lot of sense of\], I’m going to give you the chance to trf me the money. By tonight and latest my 12 pm Friday afternoon. If i don’t see it reflected in my account, I’ll just head to the police station during my lunch time.

74     The accused person replied that he will head to the bank after prayers but he “\[d\]on’t know how’s the queue gonna be.”[^109] However, Imran insisted that the accused person made payment by 12:30 pm before his prayers, failing which he would “go to the nearest police station.”[^110] Imran also pointed out that the accused person could make payment using the automatic teller machine or internet banking.[^111]

75     This was followed by a string of Whatsapp messages from the accused person seeking to further defer the payment which Imran did not reply to:[^112]

> \[17/06/2016, 7:43 AM\] Accused person: My credit limit for my card is 3k so I’d have to go to the bank. I’m going to the mosque at 10 am and I’m not going to give in to your demands over my desire to go to the mosque early. Prayers end around 140 p.m. and I’d cab to Tampunes bank. If the queu is reasonable, by 3 plus, you’d get my money. If of course, if it sounds ridiculous to you, you’re welcome to go to the police station right now. Just tell me which station and I’d head there as soon as I’m done with prayers. I said 430 because that’s the latest possible time as you wouldn’t be able to understand that delays are part of everything and they aren’t in our control. Let me know of your decision so that I don’t have to transfer my money and head to the police station straight.

> \[17/06/2016, 8:19 AM\] Accused person: Alright. No problem.

> \[17/06/2016, 8:21 AM\] Accused person: Just tell me which police station and the docket number for the complain.

> \[17/06/2016, 11:07 AM\] Accused person: So, confirm right you don’t want the money today and you’d wait till next week? Today means before 430.

76     At 11:49 hours on 17 June 2016, the accused eventually sent a Whatsapp message to Imran saying “Done”.[^113]

77     Imran then proceeded to check his bank account and confirmed that the accused person had transferred $5,000 into the same. He then replied “Okay I got it” to the accused person _via_ Whatsapp.[^114]

78     Consequently, Imran did not file a police report against the accused person.

79     Imran testified that he would not have passed his money to the accused person to invest if he had known that the accused person was unable to invest the money with any company that the accused person was purportedly working for or that Imran would not have been able to get his money back at the end of 6 months.[^115]

#### Evidence of Naziehah - C8

80     Naziehah was acquainted with the accused person through Haliim in January 2017. Subsequently, she had supper with the accused person, Halim Khan and Rashid. She testified that she was quite close to the accused person until they stopped communicating with each other in June 2017. According to Naziehah, they stopped communicating with each other as the accused person “stopped responding to \[her\] messages” in June 2017.[^116]

81     On 8 March 2017, Naziehah picked up the accused person from his home and drove to the Pasir Ris-Punggol flyover where they had a long talk about life in general – “current updates, and thoughts and viewpoints about things.”[^117] The meeting lasted about 3-4 hours, during which the accused told him that he had resigned from “Varius Evans” “because of some unfairness” and was then “working on his own”.[^118] After the meeting, Naziehah went home.

82     Just before midnight on 8 March 2017, she received the following message from the accused person on Facebook Messenger inviting her to invest with him through his ex-colleagues in “Varius Evans”:[^119]

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image7.png)

83     According to Naziehah, she had earlier confided in the accused person that she had a student loan of $30,000 to repay. However, she did not tell the accused person that she wanted to invest. Naziehah understood the accused person’s message to mean that he will help her invest her money until June and reap a profit of 40% or even 50% or more to help her pay off the student loan.[^120]

84     The accused person also asked Naziehah to “transfer \[him\] before 2pm because \[he needs\] to screenshot proof of transfer to \[his\] ex colleague.”[^121]

85     Naziehah “wanted to release the burden of \[her\] student loan” but decided to “sleep on it”.[^122] However, she indicated to the accused person that she was contemplating investing $2,000 or $3,000 and the accused person replied, “good! If 3k will be roughly 4.5k back”.[^123]

86     Eventually, Naziehah decided to invest $3,000 with the accused person for the following reasons:[^124]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So you have just explained the reason why you decided to put in the sum of 3K, but I would like to know the reason why you decided to take up this investment opportunity?

 |
| 

A

 | 

The reason was because he mentioned that investing with him would help ease my burden, and that I will get back my money. So regardless of whether or not I am going to get back more than my principal sum, he would still return me my principal sum anyway.

 |

  
  

87     On 9 March 2017, Naziehah withdrew $3,000 from her POSB Bank savings account and deposited it into the Bank Account.[^125] The transactions were documented in a POSB Bank withdrawal transaction slip and a POSB Bank credit advice slip dated 9 March 2020.[^126]

88     Naziehah testified that she would not have invested $3,000 with the accused person if she had known that:[^127]

> (a)     the approximate returns for the investment would not be 40%; and

> (b)     the accused person was not investing the money with “Varius Evans” through his ex-colleagues.

89     Shortly after Naziehah made the purported investment, the accused person updated her on the performance of the investment on 23 March 2017 _via_ Facebook Messenger. The accused person told Naziehah that her investment of $3,000 had grown to $3,948:[^128]

> \[03/23/2017, 2:49 PM\] Accused person: “… I’m supposed to update you tomorrow and I’ll update you now instead and I think you’ll be extremely happy. They surpassed the fortnight estimates by more than 3 folds! In simple terms, your 3k is now 3,948 dollars. Almost 4k! That’s just for the first 2 weeks too! I am extremely happy too. … I was given word that it would surpass their initial estimates of 40 plus percent to over 70 which is a pretty rare in a 2 month timeframe.”

90     In the same message, the accused person also suggested that Naziehah doubled her investment, “…I’ve doubled my principal sum and I believe you should too because we won’t get any more opportunity like this.”[^129]

91     Over the next few months, the accused person updated Naziehah periodically on the performance of the investment. However, on 22 June 2017, he informed Naziehah _via_ Facebook Messenger that the investment would be closed the next morning, which was a Saturday. The accused person also informed Naziehah that her investment had grown to $4,188, which he rounded off to $4,500. However, he told her that it would take 3-9 working days for the funds to be credited into the account of “Varius Evans”:[^130]

> … Anyway, they’re closing the account tomorrow at 2:30 am. Saturday morning. Your returns is 4188 but i just round it off to 4500. Easier. Allow 3-9 working days minimum for the funds to be credited into the firm’s account. I need your account number too.

92     Naziehah was delighted and replied, “I could use the money to gift my grandparents than the other way round.so cute this two. … thanks for keeping to your word fayyaz. means a lot really.”[^131]

93     Naziehah also asked the accused person, “Any idea when itd be credited?” However, the accused person did not reply.[^132]

94     Naziehah further asked the accused person, “3-9 working days from saturday is next week yes?” Again, the accused person did not reply.[^133]

95     On 8 July 2017 at 18:57 hours, Naziehah tried to get a response from the accused person:

> Naz

> Hi fayyaz

> can you get back to me asap when you see this please

96     The accused person finally replied:[^134]

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image8.png)

97     Thereafter, Naziehah and the accused person spoke to each other through Whatsapp. Naziehah could not recall what exactly they spoke about although she was sure that she was asking for her money back and the accused person was trying to delay the payment.[^135]

98     Subsequently, Naziehah again tried to get in touch with the accused person on Whatsapp Messenger to no avail:

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image9.png)

99     On 28 June 2018 at 11:18 hours, Naziehah filed a police report at the Pasir Ris Neighbourhood Police Centre.[^136] The following is an extract from the police report:

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image10.png)

#### Evidence of Mohamed Ayub Bin P N Shadul Hameed

100    Mohamed Ayub Bin P N Shadul Hameed (“**Ayub**”) incorporated Varius Evans Private Limited (“**Varius Evans PL**”) on 5 December 2013 with an issued share capital of $2 for the following business activities:[^137]

> (a)     WHOLESALE ON A FEE OR CONTRACT BASIS (EG COMMISSION AGENT)

> (b)     PASSENGER LAND TRANSPORT N.E.C. (EG PRIVATE CARS FOR HIRE WITH OPERATOR AND TRISHAWS)

101    The other corporate information on Varius Evans PL based on the BizFile records by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority were as follows:[^138]

> (a)     Registered office address: 14 Robinson Road, #13-00 Far East Finance Building, Singapore 048545

> (b)     Directors and shareholders: Ayub (managing director) and Jamilah Binte Sahul Hameed

> (c)     Secretaries: Kong Ing Ing and Pay Thiam Yong Roger

102    According to Ayub, he had incorporated Varius Evans PL as a shelf company and Varius Evans PL did not have any employees or actual trading activity.[^139] The registered office address was just a paid virtual office address while Jamilah Binte Sahul Hameed was his mother. Kong Ing Ing and Pay Thiam Yong Roger were company secretaries whom he engaged through a secretarial services company called “A-Star” to meet statutory requirements.[^140]

103    Ayub had set up a Facebook Business Page for Varius Evans PL (the “**FB Page**”)[^141] and used the FB Page to “post random articles or informations about stock exchanges, trading tips.”[^142] Ayub had also used the FB Page to promote a free ½-hour preview of a share trading course that he had conducted at the Temasek Club (the “**Preview**”) with a view to recruiting people for a more comprehensive chargeable share trading workshop (the “**Workshop**”) which did not materialise:[^143]

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image11.png)

104    Ayub recalled that the accused person had contacted him _via_ Facebook Messenger to register for the Preview but he could not recall if the accused person eventually turned up. However, after the Preview, the accused person had contacted him on Facebook Messenger again to discuss about trading:[^144]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So to clarify, how many times in total did the 2 of you communicate on Facebook?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I would say on 2 occasions.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

From what you said in your evidence, one was before the preview and one is after the preview, am I right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah, that’s right.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Why did he message you after the preview?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Why did he message me? To ask me about---I mean, if---to just, um, brainstorm about trading.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What do you mean by “brainstorm”?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Like I mentioned earlier, on how I trade, what platform I used, and what are the methods I used for trading. And he also shared his views.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How long did the conversation last?

 |
| 

A

 | 

It’s a very short conservation. I don’t know how long exactly.

 |

  
  

105    Aside from the two episodes of communication with the accused _via_ Facebook Messenger, Ayub did not have any further contact with the accused person and never met him in real life.[^145]

106    Finally, Ayub confirmed that neither he nor Varius Evans PL ever employed the accused person.[^146]

#### Evidence of Inspector Gan Ren Jian

107    Inspector Gan Ren Jian (“**Insp Gan**”) was the original investigation officer from Bedok Police Division for the case before he was posted out in March 2018.[^147]

108    Insp Gan had recorded a number of investigation statements from the accused person pursuant to section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012) (the “**CPC**”) all of which were admitted as evidence with the consent of the accused person:

109    The following is summary of the 1st Statement:

> (a)     The accused person joined “Varius Evans” in 2014 and that he had paid $2,800 to learn about the trading of stocks, commodities and derivatives over a period of 3-4 months. However, the accused person was trading on his own and was not offered any employment by “Varius Evans”.

> (b)     The accused person’s trainer was one “Mohd Ayob” and he learnt how to trade using IG-Market and FXCM using the software “Metatrader4”. Subsequently, the accused person used his savings of about $7,000 to trade using the trading platforms IG-Market and FXCM. The accused person also claimed that the following persons had transferred monies to him and asked him to help them trade:

>> i.       accused person’s uncle, Mahmud Bin Abdul Karim - $10,000;

>> ii.       Rashid - $35,000;

>> iii.       Nasrul - $10,000;

>> iv.       Halim Khan - $10,000; and

>> v.       Halim Khan’s friend - $10,000.

> (c)     The accused person claimed that he had returned $12,000 to his uncle and over $6,000 to Imran, which was more than what they invested because the accused person had “traded well and profited”. However, he had lost the all the monies transferred to him by the others.

110    In the 2nd Statement, the accused person provided more details of his trading activities using IG-Market and FXCM:

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image12.png)

111    In the 3rd Statement, the accused person stated that he had difficulty retrieving his trading records with FXCM and IG-market:

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image13.png)

112    In the 4th Statement, the accused person stated, amongst other things, the only way that he paid FXCM for the purpose of trading was using his credit card.

113    The 5th Statement contained a number of bare assertions by accused person in relation to the multiple allegations of cheating against him:

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image14.png)

114    On 5 October 2017 at 9:36 am, Insp Gan sent an email to FXCM to seek the following information in relation to the 3 accounts which the accused person claimed to have opened in 2014 and closed in 2017 bearing the user names “Xanthousa”, “fayyaz10” and “fayyadza” (as provided by the accused person in the 3rd Statement):

> (a)     account details (user name, email, national identification, nationality _etc_);

> (b)     trading records (specific stocks purchased, date, _etc_);

> (c)     monies transacted;

> (d)     date of liquidation;

> (e)     date of the start of account and date of account closure; and

> (f)     mode of payment to FXCM.

115    Through a series of email correspondence between Insp Gan and one Sammantha Clegg, Associate Counsel, Litigation and Complaints, of FXCM (“**Ms Clegg**”), it was ascertained that FXCM did not have records of any trading accounts with the user names “Xanthousa”, “fayyaz10” and “fayyadza”. Additionally, Ms Clegg informed Insp Gan that “Residents of Singapore are not eligible to apply for an FXCM live trading account with any FXCM Entity.” and that FXCM stopped taking on clients from Singapore in 2011.[^148]

#### Evidence of Station Inspector Djong Nam Him, Nicholas

116    Station Inspector Djong Nam Him, Nicholas (“**SI Djong**”) was the investigation officer from Bedok Police Division who took over the investigations from Inspector Gan.

117    He had recorded the following statements from the accused person:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="30.24%"> <col width="69.76%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Marking</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description of statement</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">P44</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statement recorded on 8 August 2018 at 15:40 hours</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(the “<b>6</b><sup>th</sup><b>Statement</b>”)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">P45</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Statement recorded on 8 August 2018 at 15:55 hours</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(the “<b>7</b><sup>th</sup><b>Statement</b>”)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

118    In the 6th Statement, the accused person stated that Naziehah had contacted him on Facebook and asked him to help her invest her money. The accused person agreed to do so and told her that she would get a return of about 20-30% of the principal sum. The accused person promised to update her every fortnight. The accused person mentioned that he “invested the said money in Stocks, on the plaform (_sic_) MetaTrader Four. This platform is linked to FXCM.” and that he had “used \[his\] debit card and transferred S$3000 to the trading account” and lost all the money.

119    In the 7th Statement, the accused person admitted that he had told a number of lies to Naziehah:

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image16.png)

120    By way of email correspondence between SI Djong and the compliance department of FXCM (the “**FXCM Compliance**”) between 7 January 2019 and 20 May 2019, FXCM Compliance confirmed that it “could not identify the individual Mohammed Fayyadz Bin Halim Angullia” in their internal records. However, FXCM Compliance declined to respond to any other requests by SI Djong as it pointed out that only the enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom have enforcement authority over FXCM.[^149]

#### Evidence of Pamela Tan Pei Hsiang

121    Pamela Tan Pei Hsiang (“**Pamela**”) was the head of sales at IG Asia Private Limited (“**IG Asia**”). She had been working for slightly over 6 years as at the day that she gave her evidence in court, _ie._ 27 February 2019.[^150]

122    As head of sales, Pamela led the sales team for client onboarding, _ie._ “… things like collecting, supporting documents for client applications, um, speaking with the right department to get the account set up. And thereafter, speaking to clients themselves to get them familiar with the trading platform, and to eventually start funding their trading accounts.”[^151]

123    Pamela testified that IG Asia was a trading platform for clients to execute their share trades by way of their mobile phone or an application. IG Asia did not provide any form of advisory service.[^152]

124    According to Pamela, IG Asia maintained a database of all applications submitted by individuals since the year 2006, regardless of whether the applications were successful.[^153]

125    Pamela confirmed that Insp Gan had written to IG Asia to enquire if the accused person had opened a trading account with them. By way of a letter dated 3 October 2017 by IG Asia to Insp Gan (the “**IG Asia Letter**”),[^154] IG Asia confirmed that it had no records of the accused person, _ie._ Mohammed Fayyadz Bin Halim Angullia, in its customer database system.

126    However, IG Asia had received an online application for an account on 1 April 2014 from an individual with the name “Fayyadz Angullia” (the “**Applicant**”) and a birth date of 29 August 1990. The application was subsequently declined as the Applicant could not be contacted for follow-up.[^155] The information on this application was set out in an email from Pamela to SI Djong dated 20 February 2019 at 5:48 pm (the “**Email**”) which set out, amongst other information, an online submission form for a live account in 2014 by one “Fayyadz Anguillia”.[^156]

127    The Email also set out the result of a search by IG Asia for the email address “XXX”, which was the email address used by the Applicant to apply for a live account. The search disclosed that the email address was used to register two demonstration accounts. A demonstration account was a practice trading account whereby the user would trade without the use of real currency.

## End of the Prosecution’s case

128    At the end of the Prosecution’s case, the accused person did not submit that there was no case to answer.

129    Nonetheless, I considered the evidence of the Prosecution and found that there was evidence, not inherently incredible, that satisfied each and every element of the respective charges against the accused person. Accordingly, I delivered the allocution under section 230(1)(m) of the CPC and called on the accused person to enter his defence.

130    The accused person elected not to make his defence:

>   
| 

Fayyadz:

 | 

Your Honour, yesterday, you give me 2 options, right? So I’m going to take the 2nd option because I do not have any proof to furnish, so I don’t think that it’ll be wise for me to take the stand. And I think that my defence has, uh, already sent it on my Cross with the witnesses. So---yah. Thank you, Your Honour.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

You do not wish to give evidence on the witness stand?

 |
| 

Fayyadz:

 | 

I don’t have any evidence or proof right now, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So you have no evidence and you have no other witnesses to call in your defence and you have no---and you do not wish to give evidence, right?

 |
| 

Fayyadz:

 | 

Yes, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

## Assessment of the evidence

#### The prosecution’s case

131    Each of the victims of the eight charges against the accused person testified that the accused person had boasted of his knowledge in investments and success in yielding high returns, albeit in slightly different ways. In the case of Rashid, the accused person had invited him to invite him to invest in “Varius Evans” on three separate occasions.

132    Similarly, the accused person had invited Naziehah to invest with “Varius Evans” through his ex-colleagues after she shared with him that she had an outstanding study loan of about $30,000.

133    Farahyn, Nasrul and Imran had separately approached the accused person to ask him for help with investments. Thereafter, the accused person had shared with them highly attractive investment opportunities with the trading company that the accused person was purportedly working for. The accused person had told Farahyn and Imran, but not Nasrul, that he worked for “Varius Evans”.

134    Syafiqah did not communicate with the accused person directly when she made the investment with him. However, since her first meeting with him in October 2015, he had already impressed upon her that he was a successful and well-off investor with a stock trading company. When Farahyn shared the investment opportunity with Syafiqah on 29 January 2016, Syafiqah expressed an interest to participate in the investment with a sum of $1,000. Accordingly, Farahyn asked the accused person if Syafiqah could do so and the accused person agreed, adding that the investment would yield a profit of $200, _ie._ 20% returns. Consequently, Syafiqah proceeded to transfer $1,000 to the Bank Account.

135    All the victims, except Imran, had bank transaction records evidencing the respective payments that they made to the Bank Account. Imran had transferred $5,000 to the accused person using an automatic teller machine at Raffles Hospital. During the accused person’s cross-examination of the victims, he did not challenge any of the victims’ evidence that they had transferred or deposited monies into the Bank Account that belonged to him. Additionally, a letter from DBS Bank dated 10 October 2017 stated that the accused person was the holder of the Bank Account.[^157]

136    All the victims did not receive any documentation or acknowledgement of their investment with the accused person, on the pretext that he would amalgamate their investments with his own investments. The accused person had even had told Rashid and Farahyn that “Varius Evans” would charge them a 20% commission if they invested directly with the company instead of through him.[^158] Based on the evidence, the accused person was not working for “Varius Evans” or any trading company.

137    All the victims testified that the accused person had periodically given them positive updates on the performance of their respective investments after they made their investments. For example, 11 months after Imran invested with the accused person, the latter had informed Imran that his investment of $5,000 had ballooned to a whooping $28,000. The periodic updates by the accused person were evidenced by the various messages that the accused person had sent to Rashid, Farahyn Nasrul, Imran and Naziehah _via_ Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp, as the case may be. Syafiqah received her updates through Farahyn. However, there was no evidence of any investments made by the accused person, much less any profits that he could have earned for the victims.

138    The accused person persistently stalled on paying the victims’ their returns, when they asked for them or when their respective investment periods were over, by claiming that the investment monies were held up due to audits or checks by various government bodies or third-party institutions such as the Ministry of Finance, the Singapore Exchange Ltd or the “Singapore Securities and Exchange Commission”. Only Imran managed to recover his capital of $5,000, about 1 year after he first made the investment and after he threatened to file a police report against the accused person. The accused person never paid Imran any of the profits that Imran had purportedly made from his investment.

139    Even though the accused person had claimed in the 1st Statement, 2nd Statement and 3rd Statement that he had paid $2,800 to learn about trading in various instruments through “Varius Evans”, that his trainer was “Mohd Ayob” and that he had used the trading platforms of IG-Market and FXCM for his trades, there was no evidence that any of these assertions were true.

140    On the contrary, Ayub had testified that Varius Evans PL was merely a shelf company with no business activities and that he never held any share trading workshop aside from a free ½-hour preview in early-2014. Ayub also told the court that he had communicated with the accused person only twice on Facebook Messenger and he had never met the accused person face-to-face.

141    The Prosecution had also adduced evidence through Pamela (head of sales at IG Asia), and by way of letters from IG Asia and FXCM that the accused person did not have any trading accounts with them. In fact, Ms Clegg (associate counsel of FXCM) had confirmed _via_ email to Insp Gan that FXCM had stopped taking on clients from Singapore since 2011.

142    All the victims came across as candid and truthful witnesses whose testimonies were internally and externally consistent, cogent and detailed. Even though a number of the victims were acquainted with one another, and had mutually shared their experiences with one another before deciding to file their respective police reports (except for Imran and Syafiqah who did not file police reports), they had denied and there was no evidence of any form of collusion. On the contrary, the testimonies of the victims were materially corroborated by bank transaction records and extracts of their Facebook Messenger and Whatspp communications with the accused person.

143    I also saw no reason to doubt the evidence of Insp Gan, SI Djong and Pamela whose evidence were objective and based on the accused person’s investigation statements, email correspondences and company records that were not challenged by the accused person.

#### The defence’s case

144    The accused person had elected not to give evidence or call any other witnesses in his defence. Aside from bare assertions in the accused person’s closing submissions, which were not supported by any evidence, there was no countervailing evidence or explanation in response to the Prosecution’s evidence that the accused person had made many untruthful representations to the victims and had not entered into any _bona fide_ investments after receiving the victims’ monies.

145    Nonetheless, I carefully considered whether any meaningful defence could be discerned from the accused person’s cross-examination of the Prosecution witnesses.

146    The following is a summary of the material aspects of the accused’s person’s cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses:

147    Except for a few disparate strands of bare assertions against the Prosecution witnesses, the accused person did not put forward any substantive defence in the cross-examination of the witnesses. On the contrary, he did not challenge the victims’ evidence that they had transferred monies to the Bank Account.

## The relevant legislation

148    Section 420 of the PC provides:

> **Cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property**

> **420**.    Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person … shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

149    The definition of cheating is set out at section 415 of the PC:

> **Cheating**

> **415**.    Whoever, by deceiving any person, whether or not such deception was the sole or main inducement, … dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person … is said to “cheat”.

> _Explanation_ 1. – A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section.

> …

> _Explanation_ 3. – Whoever makes a representation through any agent is to be treated as having made the representation himself.

150    “Dishonestly” is defined in section 24 of the PC:

> **“Dishonestly”**

> **24**.    Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.

151    In turn, “wrongful gain” and “wrongful loss” are defined in section 23 of the PC:

> **“Wrongful gain” and “wrongful loss”**

> **23**.    “Wrongful gain” is gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled; “wrongful loss” is loss by unlawful means of property which the person losing it is legally entitled.

> _Explanation_ – A person is said to gain wrongfully when such person retains wrongfully, as well as when such person acquires wrongfully. A person is said to lose wrongfully when such person is wrongfully kept out of any property, as well as when such person is wrongfully deprived of property.

## Court’s findings

152    Contrary to the overwhelming evidence that the accused person had represented to all the victims that he worked or was working as a trader in a trading company, there was no evidence that the accused person was actually employed by any company as a trader. In fact, the accused person admitted in the 1st Statement that he “was not offered any employment by Varius Evans”.

153    There was also no evidence that the accused person had made any investment with the victims’ monies on their behalf.

154    At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved the following beyond reasonable doubt:

> (a)     In relation to C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6, that:

>> i.       the accused person had deceived each of the victims into believing that he would be able to help each of them invest with a trading company by which he was employed, which he knew was false; and

>> ii.       by such deception, the accused had dishonestly induced each of the victims to deliver cash of varying amounts, as set out in C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6, to him in the Bank Account.

> (b)     In relation to C7, that:

>> i.       the accused person had deceived Syafiqah, by making representations through Farahyn, into believing that he would be able to help her invest with a trading company by which he was employed, which he knew was false; and

>> ii.       by such deception, the accused had dishonestly induced Syafiqah to deliver cash of $1,000 to him in the Bank Account.

> (c)     In relation to C8, that:

>> i.       the accused person had deceived Naziehah into believing that he would be able to help her invest with a trading company by which he used to be employed, which he knew was false; and

>> ii.       by such deception, the accused had dishonestly induced Naziehah to deliver cash of $3,000 to him in the Bank Account.

155    Accordingly, I found the accused person guilty and convicted him of all 8 charges.

## Sentencing

156    The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 27 months’ imprisonment based on the following individual sentences:

157    The following were the key sentencing factors raised by the Prosecution:[^170]

> (a)     There was significant harm caused to the victims and the total amount involved was $64,000 of which only $5,000 was returned to Imran;

> (b)     The accused person was a serial cheat who faced multiple charges;

> (c)     The accused person engaged in a premeditated and deliberate course of offending and abused the level of trust reposed in him by the victims; and

> (d)     The accused person’s conduct demonstrated his complete lack of remorse.

158    The Prosecution also submitted the following sentencing precedents:

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image17.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0086_Image/[2020] SGDC 0086_image18.png)

159    I was mindful that, except for the accused person in _Public Prosecutor v Tey Choon Yong_ (“**_Tey’s_** **Case**”), the accused persons in _Public Prosecutor v Peter Aw Boon Cheong_, _Public Prosecutor v Chng Min Sheng_ and _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Lai Heng_ had pleaded guilty to the respective charges against them.

160    The primary sentencing consideration for a cheating offence is the value of the property involved, although factors such as the number and vulnerability of the victims, the level of premeditation and deception will also have a bearing on the eventual sentence.[^171] Generally, the higher the quantum involved, “the heftier the sentence”.[^172]

161    In the present case, I agreed with the sentencing factors submitted by the Prosecution and found that the sentencing precedents provided a useful reference point for sentencing in the present case. The global sentence sought by the Prosecution was within an appropriate spectrum of sentences given the amount involved in the present case, the number of charges and the circumstances of the offences that took place over an extended period of time.

162    However, even though the accused person had claimed trial to all 8 charges, he had exercised some restraint in his cross-examination of the Prosecution witnesses and did not unduly prolong the trial. However, it also transpired that the accused person did not actually have a meaningful defence to put forward to any of the victims. I was also mindful that the accused person had repaid $5,000 to Imran even though he had done so only after Imran threatened to report him to the police.

163    All considered, I decided that the following sentences were appropriate:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="15.4430886177235%"> <col width="21.8043608721744%"> <col width="32.2264452890578%"> <col width="30.5261052210442%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Remark</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$10,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">5 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Concurrent</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$20,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">10 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C3</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C4</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$10,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">5 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Concurrent</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C5</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$10,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">5 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C6</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C7</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$1,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Concurrent</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">C8</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$3,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Concurrent</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Global Sentence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>21 months’ imprisonment</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

164    I ordered the sentences in C2, C3, C5 and C6 to run consecutively as the dates of the offences were representative of the period of the accused’s offending over more than 2½ years. I considered that the resulting global sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment befitted the circumstances of the offences based on, amongst other factors, the total amount of money involved.

165    No compensation order was made as it was apparent from the evidence that the accused person was not in a financial position to repay the balance of the monies that the victims had delivered him and the global sentence would sufficiently meet the justice of this case.
