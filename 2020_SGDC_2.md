6 January 2020

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       The accused one Mohammad Sohail, a 50-year old male Pakistani national and also Singapore Permanent Resident had pleaded guilty on 18 December 2019 to two charges namely, one charge of making a false statement in an application for Permanent Residence in Singapore for Professionals, Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers to the Singapore Immigration to enable him to obtain an entry permit granting him permanent residence in Singapore under s 57(1)(k) and punishable under s 57(1)(iv) Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Rev. Ed.) in **DAC 92634 - 2019** and a charge of using as genuine a forged document which he knew to be forged under s 471 read with s 465 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **MAC 909546-2019**.

2       I sentenced the accused to three weeks’ imprisonment for the charge under s 57(1)(k) and punishable under s 57(1)(iv) Immigration Act in **DAC 92634-2019** and similarly three weeks’ imprisonment for the charge under s 471 read with s 465 Penal Code in **MAC 909546-2019**. I ordered the sentences in **DAC 913400-2019** and **MAC 909546-2019** to run concurrently and as such his global sentence was three weeks’ imprisonment.

3       This is his appeal against his sentences filed on 18 December 2019 through his Defence Counsel, Mr Mahmood Gaznavi s/o Bashir Muhammad of Mahmood Gaznavi & Partners. The two proceeded charges against him were as follows:

> _Exhibit C1A –_ **_First charge_**

> “…that you, sometime between September to October 1997, at 95 South Bridge Road #08-26, Pidemco Centre, Singapore 058717, did by making a false statement in an “Application for Permanent Residence in Singapore for Professionals, Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers” and obtained an entry permit on 12 January 1998 for yourself, granting you Permanent Residence in Singapore, to wit, you falsely stated in the said application form that your highest academic qualification attained was “Bachelor of Arts” which you had obtained from “University of Punjab”, when in fact that was not true, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), punishable under Section 57(1)(iv) of the said Act.”

> _Exhibit C2A –_ **_Second charge_**

> “…that you, sometime between September to October 1997, at 95 South Bridge Road #08-26, Pidemco Centre, Singapore 058717, did dishonestly use as genuine a forged document, namely, a Bachelor of Arts Degree purportedly awarded by the University of Punjab, which you knew to be forged, to support the application for your permanent residency to Singapore Immigration (now known as the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 471 read with Section 465 of the Penal Code,vChapter 224, 1985 Edition.”

## B.   Statement of Facts

4       The Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) prepared by the Prosecution which the accused had admitted to without qualification is as follows:

> “1.    The accused is Mohammad Sohail, Male, 50 years old, Date of Birth: 9 June 1969. He is a Pakistani National and a Singapore Permanent Resident bearing NRIC No: XXX.

> **Background information**

> 2.    The accused first arrived in Singapore sometime in 1995 on an employment pass.Sometime in 1996, he married his wife, who was a Singaporean.

> **Facts relating to the first charge (DAC-926334-2019)**

> 3.    Sometime between September to October 1997, the accused applied to Singapore Immigration (now known as “the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority”) (“**SI**”) for an entry permit to reside permanently in Singapore (“**the Entry Permit**”). For the purposes the application, the accused submitted to SI an application form titled “Application for permanent residence for professional/technical personnel and skilled workers” (“**the form**”).The form was submitted at SI’s office, which was located at 95 South Bridge Road #08-26, Pidemco Centre, Singapore 058717.

> 4.    In the form, the accused falsely stated that his highest academic qualification attained was “Bachelor of Arts” and that he had obtained the qualification from “University of Punjab”. In reality, the accused’s highest education qualification is the equivalent of GCE “A” Levels in Singapore. The accused made the aforesaid false statement in order to obtain the Entry Permit for himself. The academic qualification of the applicant is one of the material considerations in the granting of an entry permit.

> 5.    The application was approved by SI on 19 Dec 1997, and the accused obtained the Entry Permit on 12 January 1998.

> 6.    The accused has thus committed an offence punishable under s 57(1)(iv) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (1995 Rev Ed).

> **Facts relating to the second charge (MAC-909546-2019)**

> 7.    Sometime between September to October 1997, at SI’s office, in support of the aforesaid application, the accused dishonestly submitted a forged document to SI, namely, a Bachelor of Arts Degree purportedly awarded to the accused by the University of the Punjab, Lahore, on 30 June 1991.

> 8.    In reality, the said document was “bogus” and not issued by the said university. The accused had obtained the document from his cousin in Pakistan and submitted it to SI in order to enhance his chance of succeeding in the application.

> 9.    The accused has thus committed an offence punishable under Section 471 read with Section 465 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (1985 Rev Ed).”

## C.   Antecedents

5       The Accused has no related antecedents. His previous antecedents were convictions on 11 May 2017 in Court 21 for offences under s 96(1) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276), s 35(1) punishable under s 131(2)(a) Road Traffic Act, s 120(4) punishable under s 131(2)(a) Road Traffic Act and s 3(1) Motor Vehicle (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act (Cap 189). His total sentence was a global fine of $2,600 as well as a disqualification for a period of 12 months from the date of his conviction for all classes of vehicle.

## D.   Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

6       In its written address on sentence, the Prosecution had indicated that they were seeking a custodial term of four weeks’ imprisonment for each of the proceeded charges in _DAC 926334-2019_ and _MAC 909546_ - 2019. It was submitted that they were seeking for the sentences to run concurrently resulting in a global sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment.

7       The Prosection had referred to the case of _Lin Lifen v PP [^1]_ which concerned an offender who _inter alia_, had submitted a forged degree certificate in her application for PR status (subject of a charge under s 471 PC, also under the 1985 Rev Ed) and who had also made a false statement concerning her educational qualifications (subject of a charge under s 57(1)(k) Immigration Act). It was highlighted that in this context, the High Court there made the following pertinent holdings namely:

> (i)     Where an offender makes a false statement in a PR application and supports it with a forged document, the sentence for both the s 471 PC and s 57(1)(k) IA offences ought to be same (at \[25\] to \[28\]);

> (ii) The precedents for such offenders who plead guilty to such offences ranged from two to eight weeks and the starting point for such offences is two to four weeks’ imprisonment per charge (at \[49\]).

In _Lin Lifen_, the High Court had upheld the offender’s sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment as the offender had absconded while on bail (at \[50\] to \[51\]).

8       As there were no exceptionally aggravating or mitigating factors in the present case, the Prosecution had submitted that a sentence in the middle of the range _i.e._ four week’s imprisonment would be appropriate. As the two offences relate to the same application, it was further submitted that the sentences should run concurrently.

## E.   Mitigation

9       In his written plea in mitigation, his Defence Counsel had highlighted that the accused had pleaded guilty to the following charges namely:

> i.      _DAC 92634 – 2019_: Making a false statement to obtain entry permit and the granting of Permanent Residence, an offence under s 57(1)(k) and punishable under s 57(1)(iv) Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Rev. Ed.); and

> ii.      _MAC 909546 – 2019_: Using as genuine a document knowing it to be forged to support his application for permanent residency, an offence punishable under s 471 read with s 465 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).

10     It was submitted that the Immigration Offence took place on 3 September 1997. The prescribed punishment under the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Rev. Ed.) is a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

#### Mitigating Factors

11     It was submitted that the accused’s relevant mitigating factors were as follows:

> i.     His genuine remorse;

> ii.     His co-operation with the authorities;

> iii.     His familial circumstances;

> iv.     The offences were not committed for personal gain.

## Early plea of guilt and genuine remorse

12     It was submitted that the accused had elected to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. Pursuant to the principles of _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor[^2]_, it was further submitted that it is trite that a plea of guilt is a significant mitigating factor.

13     It was the Defence’s case from the start of the matter the accused had informed the authorities that he intended to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. He did not shy away from his actions. Instead, in his cautioned statement, he apologised and acknowledged that he had made a mistake and pleaded for leniency.

14     It was submitted that in pleading guilty at an early opportunity well before the pre-trial stage, the accused had saved this Court and the Prosecution valuable time and resources which would have otherwise been expanded in pursuing this matter.

15     It was further submitted that the accused’s plea of guilt was motivated by his genuine remorse. By taking responsibility for his actions as evident in his cautioned statement recorded on 17 September 2019, the accused has admitted to his wrongdoing and was motivated by genuine remorse.

16     It was submitted that the principles in _Angliss_ were opposite and the Court was urged to accord sufficient weight to the accused’s timeous and early plea of guilt.

## Familial circumstances

17     It was the Defence’s case that the context of the accused’s familial circumstances were relevant because they relate to the genesis of the commission of the offences. It was submitted that in 1996, the accused married his Singaporean wife through an arranged marriage with the assistance of his parents. According to his Counsel at that time, the accused was a Pakistani citizen.

18     Shortly after marriage, his wife became pregnant with their first child. On 27 March 1997, the accused and his wife had their first child who is a Singapore citizen. The accused was overcomed with joy in respect of his marriage and the birth of their first child. However, at that time he was not a permanent resident of Singapore and had to return to Pakistan. It was submitted that the accused had wanted to be with his wife and child. According to his Counsel, the accused was confused and his mind was clouded. To buttress his permanent residency application, the accused went against his better judgment and committed the offences.

19     It was submitted that the accused subsequently had two more children. His second daughter was born on 30 April 1999 and his son was born on 8 August 2000. It was highlighted that both his second child and third child are also Singapore citizens.

## Offences committed not for personal gain

20     It was the Defence’s case that the offences were committed a long time ago. According to his Counsel, he was instructed that the accused has been a law-abiding permanent resident of Singapore and has a clean record, save for some minor traffic-related offences.

21     His Counsel was also instructed that the accused did not seek to gain any benefit, nor did he obtain any benefit in respect of his permanent resident status. It was orally argued before me that the fact that he had obtained permanent residence was an unnecessary ingredient of the offence and that the mere stating of a statement is not an offence provided it yielded a result or there is an attempt to yield a result. It was submitted that the accused did not rely on his permanent resident status and/or his education qualification in order to seek employment in Singapore. It was further submitted that his actions were motivated by his desire to be with his family in Singapore.

22     It was the Defence’s case that the accused’s children were born and bred in Singapore and are Singapore citizens by birth, by virtue of his wife’s Singapore citizenship. It was submitted that the accused did not use his permanent residency to obtain any form of advantage for his children.

## Submissions on Sentence

23     It was submitted that the accused should be sentenced to a fine only for both offences. It was noted that in the case of _Abu Syeed Chowdury v Public Prosecutor[^3]_ the High Court had laid down a sentencing benchmark and held that for false representation made under the various limbs under s 57(1) Immigration Act and punishable by s 57(1)(iv) of the said Act, a custodial sentence should be the norm with a fine only warranted under exceptional circumstances.

24     It was highlighted that in _Abu Syeed Chowdhury_, the offender had committed the offences with a view to obtain personal advantage. He had managed to renew his employment pass because of his purported educational qualifications and would not have succeeded in doing so but for his purported educational qualifications.

25     It was submitted that the accused was very dissimilar to the offender in _Abu Syeed Chowdhury._ It was reiterated that the accused only committed the offence in order to be able to remain in Singapore and to be with his wife and children. It was submitted that the accused did not rely on his permanent residency and/or his educational qualifications in order to obtain employment in Singapore.

26     It was highlighted in the case of _Shi Rongping v Public Prosecutor[^4]_, the offender was charged with an offence under s 57(1)(k) Immigration Act. She had made a false declaration in respect of her educational qualification that resulted in her obtaining Singapore permanent residency. It was submitted that unlike the offender in _Abu Syeed Chowdhury_, the offender in _Shi Rongping_ was a first-time offender and had committed the offence not for the purpose of employment but rather to live as a housewife to a Singapore citizen. It was also orally highlighted that the High Court had distinguished the case of _Abu Syeed Chowdhury_ as it observed that the accused there had several offences. The High Court allowed the offender’s appeal and set aside her sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment and substituted it with a fine of $3,000.

27     It was submitted that against the backdrop of the facts in _Shi Rongping_, the facts in the present case was similar to _Shi Rongping_. It was Defence’s case that the client had committed the offence in order to be with his family. It was submitted that his motivations for committing the offence was identical with the offender’s motivation in _Shi Rongping_. It was further orally submitted that when he came to Singapore, the accused had an Employment Pass and he married a Singaporean. Those two factors would have played a role in assisting him in getting some status in Singapore. The academic qualification of the applicant is one of the material considerations and the granting of an entry permit. For the _Abu Syeed Chowdhury_’s case, it was submitted that the impact the deception played had been diluted by the fact that it is only one of the factors rather than being a decisive factor. It was the Defence’s case that the offence committed simply enhanced his chance in succeeding in the application as opposed to playing an overriding or a material factor to be relied upon in granting the permanent residence. Consequently, it was further submitted that the Court should follow the High Court’s decision in _Shi Rongping_ and sentence the accused to a fine not exceeding $3,000 for the immigration offence.

28     In respect of the forgery offence in the context of immigration offences in which the false declarations was made it was submitted that it is often the case for the offender to also commit forgery-related offences. It was highlighted that this was observed in the High Court decision of _Lin Lifen v Public Prosecutor[^5]_.

29     It was submitted that the Court in _Lin Lifen_ observed at \[25\] that it would be in the Prosecution’s discretion as to charge the offender for either an offence under the Immigration Act or under the Penal Code. It was the Defence’s case that this was an important observation because both offences attracted different ranges of punishment.

30     It was further observed in _Lin Lifen_ at \[27\] that in such situations the offences under the Immigration Act and/or the Penal Code would effectively form one transaction and were essentially two manisfestations of a single criminal enterprise namely a scheme to deceive the immigration authorities into thinking that the offender was better-qualified than she actually was with the aid of a forged document. It was submitted that this was an important observation because the Court in _Lin Lifen_ at \[27\] had noted that the offender’s culpability for making the false declaration was virtually indistinguishable from the offender’s culpability in using the forged document.

31     It was the Defence’s case that the principles in _Lin Lifen_ were applicable to the present matter. It was submitted that in the present case, the accused sought to deceive the immigration authorities on his educational qualification with the aid of a forged document. By applying the principles in _Lin Lifen_, it would mean that the accused had committed two offences that form part of the same transaction in which his culpability for the immigration offence was indistinguishable from his culpability for the forgery offence.

32     It was further orally submitted that an important point that the Defence wanted to focus on was that at \[46\] of _Li Lifen_ the High Court had stated the following:

> “…So, for instance, given a case in which the false statement is material and the extent of the deception is significant, but the consequences of the deception are not substantial, I would not say categorically that a custodial sentence should should never be imposed…”

33     It was submitted that given the factual circumstances of the accused and coupled with the sentencing principles in _Shi Rongping_, the accused should be sentenced to a fine of not more than $3,000 for the immigration offence. Given that his culpability for both the immigration offence and the forgery offence were virtually indistinguishable as per the principles in _Lin Lifen_, it was submitted that the accused should be sentenced to a punishable identical to that of the immigration offence.

34     In conclusion, it was submitted that a global sentence of fine of $3,000 would be more sufficient punishment for the accused. It was the Defence’s case that it is consistent with the law and there were no aggravating factors to warrant a custodial sentence. It was hoped that the Court would grant him leniency given the facts.

## F.   The Prosecutions’ Reply

35     In their oral response to the written plea in mitigation, the Prosecution had observed that the Defence Counsel had relied on the case of _Shi Rongping_ and had emphasised the fact that his client’s main goal was to stay with his spouse.

36     It was submitted that in _Lin Lifen_, the High Court had considered many authorities including _Shi Rongping_ itself and after an extensive analysis of the various cases at \[49\] had set out the sentencing range of two to four weeks’ imprisonment as the starting point. The High Court was of the view that there was nothing exceptional in _Lin Lifen_ that would warrant a non-custodial sentence.

## G.   The Sentences

#### Prescribed punishment for an offence under Section 57(1)(k) Immigration Act

37     The prescribed punishment for an offence of making a false statement to obtain or attempt to obtain an entry or re-entry permit, pass or certificate for himself or for any other person under s 57(1)(iv) Immigration Act is a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding one year or to both.

38     In my consideration of the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I noted that the accused had first arrived in Singapore sometime in 1995 on an Employment Pass. Sometime in 1996, he married his wife, a Singapore citizen. Subsequently between the months of September to October 1997, he had applied to Singapore Immigration for an entry permit to reside permanently in Singapore. He had submitted an application form titled “Application for Permanent Residence for Professional, Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers”. I was mindful that this application form was specifically intended for the category of professional, technical personnel and skilled workers and he had falsely declared that his highest academic qualification attained was “Bachelor of Arts” from “University of Punjab” when in fact his highest education qualification was the equivalent of GCE “A” Levels in Singapore.

39     His application to be a permanent resident was approved by the immigration authorities on 19 December 1997 and the accused obtained the entry permit on 12 January 1998. It was unclear when or how the immigration authorities discovered the offence but the accused was first charged in Court 23 for the offence only 18 September 2019 more than 21 years later. This shows that such deception was difficult to detect as this would require verification from the foreign academic authorities that issued the certificates and such verification usually require a considerable length of time. It was accepted by the Defence that the academic qualification of the applicant is one of the material considerations in the granting of an entry permit.

40     Nevertheless it was the Defence’s case that the fact that the accused had an Employment Pass and he married a Singaporean would have played a role in assisting him in getting some status in Singapore. The academic qualification of the applicant is one of the material considerations and the granting of an entry permit. It was submitted that the impact the deception played had been diluted by the fact that it is only one of the factors rather than being a decisive factor. It was also the Defence’s case that the offence committed simply enhanced his chance in succeeding in the application as opposed to playing an overriding or a material factor to be relied upon in granting the permanent residence.

41     In determining the appropriate sentence, the factors that the Court would consider include the following:

> \*    Impact/materiality of falsehood on grant of application;

> \*    Great lengths taken to deceive authorities;

> \*    Conscious defiance of authorities eg failure to declare entry ban;

> \*    Nature of deception difficult to detect;

> \*    Forged documents;

> \*    Detriment suffered for example by an employer;

> \*    Put others at risk without the requisite skills.

42     In the present case, I was further guided by the sentencing benchmark in _Lin Lifen v PP_ where the High Court had expressed the view that the starting point for making a false statement on educational qualification in an application for permanent residence should be two to four weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution had sought an imprisonment term of four weeks’ while the Defence was seeking a fine of $3,000 for this charge.

43     I noted that while his Counsel accepted that the usual sentence for such an offence was a custodial sentence, it was the Defence’s case that there were exceptional circumstances in the present case. It was argued that the accused had not committed the offence for personal gain as he had not sought to obtain any benefit nor did he obtain any benefit from the permanent resident status. He had not relied on his permanent resident status and/or his education qualification in order to seek employment in Singapore. According to his Counsel, his actions were motivated by his desire to be with his family in Singapore.

44     I disagreed with Counsel’s assertion that the accused had not committed the offence for personal gain as he had not sought to obtain any benefit nor did he obtain any benefit from the permanent resident status. In his plea in mitigation, it was submitted that the accused had to return to Pakistan after the birth of his first child as he was not a permanent resident. It was clear that a permanent resident status carries with it substantially greater rights and privileges, in particular his ability to continue to stay in Singapore without the usual restrictions of having to meet the eligibility criteria of an employment pass and its limited duration had he still been on an employment pass.

45     I also disagreed with his Counsel’s submissions that the impact the deception played had been diluted by the fact that it is only one of the factors rather than being an overriding or a material factor to be relied upon in granting the permanent residence. In my view, his educational qualification would have been highly material in an application for permanent residence as his application was specifically intended for the category of professional, technical personnel and skilled workers. The fact of his marriage to a Singapore citizen would not have diluted its significance in the immigration authorities’ consideration when dealing with such an application.

46     In my view, the argument that his actions were motivated by his desire to be with his family in Singapore were neither exceptional nor unique. Furthermore, unlike the offender in _Shi Rongping_ this was not an instance where he faced a single charge under the Immigration Act but also an additional charge of using as genuine a forged document under s 471 read with s 465 Penal Code. Hence, I saw no reason to depart from the usual custodial sentence for an offence of this nature.

47     I also noted that the accused was not as law abiding as his Counsel had made him out to be. In 2017, he was convicted of offences of driving without a valid driving licence, using a vehicle without the requisite insurance coverage, driving a vehicle without the owner’s consent and failed to comply with a traffic directions or signs. In my view, these were not just minor traffic-related offences but showed his propensity not to comply with the laws of Singapore. Nevertheless, I accorded some weight to his plea of guilt, his show of remorse and imposed a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment instead of the four weeks that the Prosecution had sought.

#### Prescribed punishment under Section 471 Penal Code

48     The prescribed punishment for an offence of using as genuine a forged document under s 471 read with s 465 Penal Code is a term of imprisonment that may extend to 2 years or with a fine, or with both. In the present case, the accused had used as genuine a Bachelor of Arts Degree purportedly awarded by the University of Punjab, which he knew to be forged and not issued by the said university to support the application for his permanent residency to Singapore Immigration. He had obtained the forged document from his cousin in Pakistan and submitted it in order to enhance his chance of succeeding in the application. The accused’s highest education qualification was in fact the equivalent of GCE “A” Levels in Singapore and he had not even studied at the University of Punjab.

49     In my sentencing considerations, I was guided by the High Court’s observation in _Lin Lifen_ at \[25\] to \[28\] that such offences was essentially a single criminal enterprise, viz a scheme to deceive the immigration authorities into thinking the accused was better qualified than he actually was with the aid of a forged document. Thus, where an offender makes a false statement in a permanent residence application and supports it with a forged document, the sentence for both the s 471 Penal Code and s 57(1)(k) Immigration Act offences ought to be same. As I had imposed a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment for the immigration offence, I accordingly imposed a similar sentence of three weeks imprisonment for the charge of using as genuine a forged document in _MAC 909546-2019_.

50     Given that the offences were essentially a single criminal enterprise, I agreed with the Prosecution that the two imprisonment terms in _DAC 926334-2019_ and _MAC 909546-2019_ ought to run concurrently. Hence, the accused global sentence in respect of his present case was three weeks’ imprisonment.

51     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused through his Counsel had filed a Notice of Appeal against his sentences on 18 December 2019. The accused is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.
