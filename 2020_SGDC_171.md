CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND SENTENCING – Sentencing – Prisons Act – Section 50Y sentence for serious breach of mandatory aftercare condition

24 August 2020

### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       I had delivered the following reserved judgment on 3 August 2020 setting out my reasons for the sentence. I have nothing further to add.

2       This judgment is to be read in conjunction with the Grounds of Decision in _Public Prosecutor v Mohamad Dom Bin Matsaad_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 11</span> (“_Dom_”). In the case of _Dom_, I had discussed the principles and approaches to be adopted and the factors to be considered in the calibration of enhanced sentences under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).

3       The present case involves the determination of an enhanced sentence under section 50T(1)(a) of the Act for a _breach of the basic condition_ of a remission order under the Conditional Remission System. In addition, this judgment also deals with the passing of a sentence for an offence under section 50Y(1)(a) of the Act for a _serious breach_ of the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme conditions.

## Background facts

4       The accused in this case is Norfarah Binte Amir Hamzah (“Norfarah”). She is 36 years old and a repeat offender for the consumption of specified drugs. Her first brush with the law was in 2001 at the age of 17, when she was imprisoned for four months for offences of criminal intimidation. She has been in and out of prison since that year, for various offences including thefts, voluntarily causing hurt and misuse of drugs.

5       In 2015, Norfarah was sentenced to the mandatory minimum imprisonment of five years (LT1) for the consumption of morphine, a specified drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). At the same time, she was also given a consecutive sentence of one year’s imprisonment for an offence under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed).

6       Norfarah served two-thirds of her total sentence of imprisonment of six years and was released on 5 January 2019 pursuant to a remission order issued by the Commissioner of Prisons under the Conditional Remission System (“CRS”). The remission order states that the remaining portion of her sentence from 5 January 2019 to 23 December 2020 is suspended.

7       Norfarah was also subject to the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”) conditions from 5 January 2019 to 4 July 2020. She was to reside in a halfway house and undergo the programmes as provided by the halfway house and abide by the house rules. She must remain indoors between 2200 hours and 0600 hours every day of the week at the halfway house. She must respond promptly to all telephone calls from her supervision officers. If she was admitted to a hospital, she must inform her supervision officers of the date and time of her discharge from hospital, without undue delay.

## Facts of present offences

8       On 10 July 2019, Norfarah was arrested by the police on suspicion of consumption of a controlled drug. Her urine samples were procured and sent for analysis and found to contain the specified drug morphine, a metabolite of diamorphine (which is also known as heroin). She admitted to consuming heroin three days prior to her arrest. She had relapsed into smoking heroin because she was stressed by her family problems.

9       As mentioned at \[7\], Norfarah was required under the MAS to reside at a halfway house from 5 January 2019 to 4 July 2020 unless she was admitted to a hospital. In the early hours of 17 July 2019, she was conveyed from the halfway house to Changi General Hospital by ambulance and warded in the hospital on the same day.

10     On 19 July 2019, the nurses discovered that Norfarah had not been seen in the hospital ward since the afternoon of that day. The hospital informed the halfway house just past midnight on 20 July 2019 that she was missing from the hospital ward. Members of the staff of the halfway house called the mobile telephone number of Norfarah but did not receive any response. They sent text messages via WhatsApp requesting her to return to the halfway house immediately as she had not obtained any approved time-off.

11     On 21 July 2019 at 12.42 a.m., a police report was lodged against Norfarah for committing a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition by failing to remain indoors at the halfway house for a cumulative period of more than 24 hours. On 22 July 2019, she was arrested by the police at about 8.00 p.m.

12     Norfarah was last seen at the hospital on 19 July 2019 at around 2.30 p.m. Since she was not at the hospital, she was expected to return to the halfway house by 4.30 p.m. on 19 July 2019. By failing to return to the halfway house, Norfarah had therefore wilfully remained out of the halfway house, until her arrest by the police, for a period of 75 hours and 30 minutes between 19 and 22 July 2019.

13     She was charged in court and has been in remand since 24 July 2019. She is represented by a counsel assigned under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”).

## Offences and charges taken into consideration

14     Norfarah pleaded guilty to the commission of two offences. She also admitted and consented to two other charges being taken into consideration for sentence. The offences and TIC charges are:

## Submissions on sentence

15     The Prosecution and the Defence share the common position that the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment for the LT2 offence is appropriate. I saw no reason to disagree with the parties’ common position on imposing the minimum sentence for the offence _per se_, in view of her early plea of guilt and the absence of aggravating factors. This decision was straightforward to arrive at.

16     What is not straightforward to calibrate is the enhanced sentence (under s50T(1)(a) of the Act) for the breach of the basic condition of the remission order and the sentence (under s50Y(1)(a) of the Act) for the serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition.

17     I invited the DPP and the defence counsel to put in written submissions on these two aspects. They have done so and I thank them for their assistance.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

18     The Prosecution sought for a total imprisonment term of not less than seven years and 260 days – the minimum seven years for the LT2 offence plus the enhanced sentence of 130 days for the breach of the basic condition of the remission order and another 130 days (to run consecutively) for the offence of the serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition.

19     On the issue of the enhanced sentence for the breach of the basic condition of the remission order, the DPP submitted that there are two broad questions to be answered – whether an enhanced sentence ought to be imposed and if so, the length of the enhanced sentence. The DPP answered both questions as follows:

> (a)     It is obvious that the LT2 offence is grave and of the same nature _i.e._ consumption of a specified drug; it is virtually identical to the remission offence of LT1 for which she was sentenced to five years of imprisonment in 2015. The imposition of an enhanced sentence is therefore warranted.

> (b)     As for the duration of the enhanced sentence, the Prosecution’s position is that an enhanced sentence around the mid-point of the remaining period of the remission order would serve the ends of justice in this case.

20     On the sentence for the offence under Section 50Y(1) of the Act for the serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition, the DPP submitted that the sentence should be also around the mid-point of the remaining period of the remission order. The DPP highlighted that the mandatory aftercare conditions help to ensure that the accused’s location and activities at any given time comply with the needs of the rehabilitation program. Serious breaches of these conditions frustrate this purpose. The longer the breach continues, the longer the purpose of the MAS is frustrated and the greater need for both general and specific deterrence.

21     The serious breach in this case involved a duration three times in excess of the 24-hour threshold and she did not surrender but was arrested. The MAS conditions were supposed to be complied with for a period of 18 months from 5 January 2019 to 4 July 2020 but she had only done so for slightly over six months before she breached them in July 2019. The Prosecution accepts that she did not commit any other offence when she stayed away from the halfway house and she had also pleaded guilty. On the other hand, there is the offence of failing to wear the electronic tag to be taken into consideration for sentence.

22     In view of the requirement of the law that these sentences must be ordered to run consecutively, the DPP submitted for the application of the Totality Principle to avoid a crushing sentence. The DPP suggested a further reduction by 50% of the proposed enhanced sentence and the sentence for the serious breach. With that, the Prosecution’s suggested total sentence was seven years and 260 days of imprisonment.

### Mitigation & Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

23     The defence counsel sought for a sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment for the LT2 offence and 261 days of imprisonment for the offence of the serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition. The defence counsel appeared to take the view that there is no necessity to impose an enhanced sentence for the breach of the basic condition of the remission order. He only addressed the sentencing for the offence of the serious breach under s50Y(1)(a) and did not make any submissions on the issue of the enhanced sentence under s50T(1)(a) of the Act.

24     After analysing the decisions of the District Courts in _PP v Danny Eliezer Vaswani_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 181</span> (“_Vaswani_”) and in _Dom’s_ case, the defence counsel proposed the following framework.

25     Stage 1. To take the maximum remaining remission period as the starting point and calibrate the length of the sentence based on the factors in s50Y(2)(a)-(d) of the Act. Next, determine the degree of severity – low, moderate, high – using the sentencing band approach and derive an indicative starting range based on whether the serious breach evidences a lack of commitment by the person to his rehabilitation and reintegration into society.

26     Stage 2. Adjust the sentence upwards or downwards by determining the degree of severity (low, moderate, high) based on the gravity of the serious breach by looking at factors such as the duration of the serious breach and the motivations and reasons behind the breach.

27     Utilizing his proposed framework, the defence counsel submitted at Stage 1 that his client would fall within the indicative starting range of one-third to two-thirds of the balance of her remission sentence. For Stage 2, he submitted that her culpability was low as she did not commit the LT2 offence during her breach of the MAS conditions and that she left the hospital on the spur of the moment – it was not pre-meditated. All in all, the defence counsel proposed an imprisonment term of 261 days, which is about half the length of the remaining period of her suspended sentence as at the date of the serious breach.

## Sentencing considerations and issues

28     From the facts and circumstances of this case and the sentencing submissions put up by the Prosecution and the Defence, the issues to be determined for the calibration of the sentences are:

> (a)     Can the sentencing approach to calibrate an enhanced sentence under section 50T in _Dom’s_ case be adopted for the calibration of a sentence under section 50Y of the Act?

> (b)     How much of the Totality Principle is relevant?

### Approach in Dom’s case for 50T enhanced sentence

29     Section 50T(1)(a) of the Act provides as follows:

> “(1)  When a person commits an offence in breach of the basic condition of his remission order made under Division 2 or 3, the court may, **_in addition_** to imposing any sentence on the person for that offence, impose an **_enhanced sentence_** for that offence as follows:

>> (a)    Imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the commission of the offence; ”

(emphasis in **_italics_** mine)

30     The principles and approaches to be adopted and the factors to be considered in the calibration of the **enhanced sentence** under section 50T(1)(a) of the Act were elucidated in the Grounds of Decision for the case of _Dom_.

31     The brief facts of _Dom’s_ case are as follows:

> “Dom had pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the offence of Affray. Prosecution and Defence agreed that an imprisonment term of one week was sufficient punishment for the offence _per se_. However, he had committed this offence when he was under a remission order. Therefore, he was liable for an enhanced sentence to be imposed under section 50T(1)(a) of the Act. The remaining period of the suspended sentence was 713 days.

> The bulk of this remaining duration of the suspended sentence was due to the LT1 sentence he had received of 66 months’ imprisonment. The other part of the suspended sentence was derived from the consecutive sentence of 8 months for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt.

> Dom was given a sentence of one week for the offence of Affray and an enhanced sentence of 30 days under section 50T(1)(a) of the Act.

> The Prosecution filed an appeal against sentence but subsequently discontinued the appeal after the Grounds of Decision were rendered.”

32     The approach put forth for determining the 50T enhanced sentence and applied in _Dom’s_ case can be summarized as follows:

> (a)     The determination of the enhanced sentence is a distinct and separate sentencing exercise from the sentence to be passed for the (breaching) offence.

> (b)     There are two decisions to be made in the enhanced sentencing exercise – whether an enhanced sentence is warranted and the length of the enhanced sentence, if it is warranted.

> (c)     The enhanced sentence is not a “fresh” sentence in that the court is not called upon to generate a sentence from scratch. Instead, the court is tasked to decide how much of the remaining suspended sentence ought to be “clawed back” and served in prison.

> (d)     The factors for making the two decisions at (b) are stipulated in section 50T(3) of the Act. These are the gravity of the breaching offence, the similarity of the breaching offence to the remission offence(s) and how long the person had remained crime-free after release on remission. It is evident from these factors that the court has to be concerned with not only the breaching offence but also with the remission offences for which the person was placed on conditional remission.

> (e)     The enhanced sentence is to be imposed and calibrated with the objectives of the CRS in mind. As spelt out in section 50E(1) of the Act, the purposes of the remission of sentences are to encourage good conduct and industry by prisoners who are serving their sentences and to facilitate the rehabilitation of prisoners and their reintegration into society. Bearing in mind the objectives of the CRS, the imposition of the enhanced sentence must serve the purposes for which a person was placed on remission and it must safeguard the integrity and not undermine the effective functioning of the CRS.

33     Following from the above approach (and the detailed discussion of how to assess the relevant sentencing factors in the Grounds of Decision in _Dom’s_ case), the steps for calibrating an enhanced sentence are:

> (a)     Consider if an enhanced sentence is warranted based on the gravity of the breaching offence and the similarity with the remission offence(s). If the breaching offence is dissimilar and not grave, an enhanced sentence would not be warranted unless the circumstances of the re-offending revealed a blatant disregard for the law or a total lack of interest to remain crime-free.

> (b)     Once an enhanced sentence is warranted, the starting position is to impose the full period remaining of the suspended sentence as at the date of the commission of the breaching offence, on the basis that there has been a fundamental violation of the conditional release to serve the final part of the sentence in the community.

> (c)     Where there is more than one type of remission offences giving rise to the suspended sentence, the court would have to decide whether to exclude the portion of the suspended sentence which are attributable to the remission offence which is dissimilar from the breaching offence. This was the situation in _Dom’s_ case where the bulk of the suspended sentence was due to the LT1 sentence. The breaching offence was Affray, which was not grave and a totally different type of offence. The portion due to the LT1 sentence was therefore excluded.

> (d)     The next step is to consider the similarity of the breaching offence with the remission offence. If they are identical or very similar, there would be no reason not to impose the full remaining period. If they are not similar but the breaching offence is grave, a significant length could still be justifiably imposed, depending on the nature of the breaching offence and how soon it was committed after the conditional release from prison. The commission of a grave offence while on conditional remission is an abuse of the opportunity to be released and rehabilitated within the community.

34     A caution must always be borne in mind that in assessing the factors for calibrating the enhanced sentence, there is to be careful avoidance of double counting of the factors for the enhanced sentence and the factors for the breaching offence.

### Different approach for 50Y sentence?

35     Section 50Y(1)(a) of the Act provides as follows:

> “(1)  A person who commits a serious breach of mandatory aftercare condition of his remission order shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to –

>> (a)    imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the offence; ”

36     The imposition of a custodial sentence after a conviction for the offence of a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition is mandated by law under section 50Y(1) of the Act. As required under section 50Y(5) of the Act, the imprisonment term imposed under section 50Y of the Act must run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment.

37     Although the MAS operates within the framework of the CRS, there are several key differences to take note of in the calibration of the enhanced sentence under section 50T(1)(a) of the Act for a breach of the basic condition of the remission order and the sentence under section 50Y(1)(a) for a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition. The material differences are:

> (a)     The 50T enhanced sentence is a sentence in addition to the sentence to be passed for the breaching offence. The 50T enhanced sentence is discretionary and not mandatory.

> (b)     A serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition is a distinct offence under the Act. The 50Y sentence is a custodial sentence which must be imposed upon the conviction of the offence. The 50Y sentence is a punishment for the distinct offence and not an add-on to a custodial sentence for a breaching offence.

> (c)     The factors to be considered for the 50T enhanced sentence are found in section 50T(3)(a)-(d) of the Act and the factors for the passing of a 50Y sentence are found in section 50Y(2)(a)-(d) of the Act.

38     Do these differences warrant a different sentencing approach when calibrating the 50T enhanced sentence and the 50Y sentence?

39     I am of the view that a broadly similar approach to the 50T enhanced sentence can be applied, with modification, to the calibration of the 50Y sentence. The MAS was introduced within the framework of the CRS and therefore shared the same objectives as the CRS. It is stated in section 50V(1) of the Act that the purpose of the mandatory aftercare conditions is to facilitate a person’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society.

40     The length of the 50T enhanced sentence and the 50Y sentence are both limited by the remaining duration of the remission order. This is regardless of how many offences in breach of the basic condition of the remission order have been committed or how many serious breaches of the MAS conditions have occurred. (See section 50T(2)(b) and section 50Y(3)(b) of the Act.)

41     The approach to calibrate the 50Y sentence, with the modifications, are summarized as follows:

> (a)     The starting position is to impose the full remaining duration of the suspended sentence. This is similar to the approach for the 50T enhanced sentence.

> (b)     Based on the factors stipulated in section 50Y(2)(a)-(d) of the Act, calibrate the sentence for the offence based on the gravity of the serious breach, how soon after being released was the offence committed and whether the serious breach showed a lack of commitment by the person to his rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The key difference here from the 50T enhanced sentencing is the absence of any comparison of similarity to the remission offence(s).

> (c)     Taking reference from the case of _Vaswani_, the next step is to determine the degree of severity of the breach using the sentencing band framework by identifying the elements of the breach and assessing the gravity of the offence within the low, moderate or high levels of severity.

42     Unlike the possibility of double counting in calibrating the 50T enhanced sentence, there is no need to be concerned about this aspect when calibrating the 50Y sentence as the serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition is a distinct offence.

### The Relevance of the Totality Principle

43     Before we move on to carry out the exercise of calibrating the sentences for Norfarah in this case, there is one more issue to contend with and that is whether the Totality Principle is to feature in the final analysis. The Totality Principle is primarily a principle of limitation to avoid aggregate sentences of unrelated offences that are disproportionate to the overall criminality presented: _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span>.

44     I have my doubts as to the relevance of the Totality Principle in dealing with the enhanced sentence for a breach of the basic condition of a remission order and the sentence for a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition. This is because there is already a limiting mechanism worked into the provisions for imposing these sentences. Although section 50T(5) and section 50Y(5) of the Act stipulates that these sentences shall run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment, the provisions in section 50T(2)(b) and section 50Y(3)(b) of the Act limit the aggregate length of all these sentences not to exceed the remaining duration of the remission order.

## Sentencing

45     To recap, the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment of seven years for the LT2 offence committed by Norfarah is the appropriate sentence to be passed in this case, in view of her plea of guilt and the absence of aggravating factors for a higher sentence to be imposed. It is to the calibration of the 50T enhanced sentence and the sentence for the serious breach of the mandatory aftercare condition under section 50Y that I now turn to.

### The calibration of the 50T enhanced sentence

46     The first stage in the consideration of the 50T enhanced sentence is whether the enhanced sentence is warranted. I accept the DPP’s submissions that it is warranted. The factors identified in section 50T(3) for consideration are the gravity of the breaching offence, the similarity of the breaching offence to the remission offence(s) and the length of time the person did not commit any offence after being released on remission. Norfarah had re-offended by consuming a specified drug which is the offence which she was sentenced to imprisonment of five years in 2015. She has committed essentially the same type of drug offence and there is no doubt the offences of LT1 and LT2 are grave offences. Therefore, there is a sound basis for the imposition of the enhanced sentence. Not imposing the enhanced sentence for the LT2 offence would undermine the CRS.

47     The second stage in the calibration of the 50T enhanced sentence starts with the full period of the remaining duration of the remission order. The date of the LT2 offence is 10 July 2019 and her remission order ends on 23 December 2020. Therefore, the full period which may be imposed as the enhanced sentence is 533 days.

48     With 533 days as the starting point, the next step is to determine the gravity of the breaching offence and the similarity of the breaching offence to the remission offences. The breaching offence is LT2 drug consumption which is punishable with a minimum imprisonment of 7 years and a maximum imprisonment of 13 years. It is certainly a grave offence.

49     Moving on to the factor of similarity with the remission offences, the LT2 offence is identical to the LT1 offence except that the LT2 offence is more serious. The LT1 offence is punishable with a minimum imprisonment of 5 years and not more than 7 years. However, the remission offences also included an offence under the Moneylenders Act. For this offence, Norfarah was sentenced to imprisonment of one year which was ordered to run consecutively with the LT1 sentence of five years’ imprisonment.

50     As per the approach in Dom’s case for such a scenario where there is a remission offence which is not similar and unconnected to the commission of the breaching offence, there should be a reduction in the remaining portion of the suspended sentence in proportion to the dissimilar remission offence. Therefore, in this case, since the sentence for the Moneylenders Act offence was one year and the sentence for the LT1 offence was five years, there should be a reduction in the total remaining period of 533 days by one-sixth. Reducing the total remaining period by one-sixth (which is 89 days) works out to 444 days.

51     As I had analysed in _Dom’s_ case, the time factor of how soon after being released on remission the person re-offends is already inherent in the system. The earlier the person re-offends, the longer is the period for enhanced sentence; the later the person re-offends, the shorter is the period for enhanced sentence. In the present case, Norfarah re-offended after about six months and that is why the remaining period of her remission is about one and a half years.

52     I had also indicated in _Dom’s_ case that the fact that a person had pleaded guilty to the breaching offence would not in principle be considered a mitigating factor for the purpose of the enhanced sentence. This is because, the enhanced sentence is consequential upon the conviction of the breaching offence. Furthermore, the mitigating value of a guilty plea had already been factored into the calibration of the sentence for the breaching offence. There should not be a double counting of this factor.

53     Based on the aforesaid approach and calibration, the enhanced sentence to be imposed under section 50T(1)(a) of the Act should be 444 days of imprisonment. But as we will see later, this is not the end of the calibration in respect of the enhanced sentence.

### The calibration of the 50Y sentence

54     The first thing to bear in mind for the calibration of the sentence under section 50Y(1)(a) of the Act for an offence of a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition is that this is a distinct offence and not an add-on to the punishment for a breaching offence. The person who commits a serious breach of a MAS condition must have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty after a trial and convicted of the offence under section 50Y(1)(a) of the Act. Therefore, if the person had shown remorse by pleading guilty and saved public resources, this would amount to a mitigating factor which ought to be accorded some weight in imposing a lower sentence.

55     Although the serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition is treated by law as a separate and distinct offence, the court is not called upon to generate a “fresh” sentence. Instead, the court is limited by the remaining period of the suspended sentence of the remission offence(s) in the punishment it can mete out as a sentence under section 50Y(1)(a) of the Act. This is regardless of how many serious breaches of the MAS conditions were incurred during the period of the remission order (see section 50Y(3)(b) of the Act).

56     As discussed at \[35\]-\[42\], the starting point is the full period of the remaining duration of the remission order. Norfarah committed this offence of the serious breach on 20 July 2019 which meant that the remaining duration of the remission order was 523 days from 20 July 2019 to 23 December 2020.

57     Next, we consider the level of severity of the serious breach of the mandatory aftercare condition. Norfarah was missing for a total of 75 hours and 30 minutes. I agree with the DPP’s submissions that the offending conduct was of a moderate severity for the reasons he had provided i.e. the length of time was about three times in excess of the threshold of 24 hours and she did not commit any crime during that time. I did not agree with the defence counsel that the level of severity is low. The fact that the person left the hospital instead of from the halfway house does not reduce the severity of the offence. Conversely, absconding from the hospital where she was brought for treatment could arguably be considered as more serious.

58     As for the level of culpability, I agree with both the Prosecution and Defence that it is in the moderate range. The main consideration for this factor stipulated in section 50Y(2)(c) of the Act is whether the serious breach evidences a lack of commitment by the person to her rehabilitation and reintegration into society. I accept the defence counsel’s submissions that Norfarah had been gainfully employed as a laundry assistant during the remission period. On the other hand, although she claimed to have committed the offence as she wanted to visit her mother, she did not return to the halfway house but was instead arrested. As the level of culpability and the gravity of the serious breach have been assessed to be at the moderate level, the sentence to be imposed should be half of the remaining period of the suspended sentence. The remaining period is 523 days and half of that would be 261 days (rounded down to the nearest day).

59     Norfarah had pleaded guilty to this offence and should be given a discount but at the same time, there are the two charges to be taken into consideration for sentence. These two charges are for the failure to wear the electronic transmission device and the related offence of mischief for tearing the electronic tag. Therefore, the mitigating value of the plea of guilt is negated by the aggravating effect of the charges taken into consideration for sentence.

60     Up till this stage, the calibrations are 444 days for the 50T enhanced sentence and 261 days for the 50Y sentence. These sentences have to be run consecutively by law but by doing so, the aggregate sentence for the 50T and 50Y sentences would be 705 days and this would exceed the 533 days of the remaining period of the suspended sentence as at 10 July 2019 – the date of commission of the first offence (the LT2 offence).

61     In my view, although there is no specific provision in the Act directly prohibiting such a sentencing result, the spirit of the provisions in section 50T(2)(b) and section 50Y(3)(b) of the Act would be violated. As I see it, there should not be any punishment beyond the remaining period of the suspended sentence regardless of the number of breaches, either of the basic condition or of the mandatory aftercare conditions. The structure of the CRS and MAS, in replacing the previous unconditional remission, were not intended to subject the person, who has been granted conditional remission, to additional punishment longer than what the court had previously decided as sentences for the remission offences. The CRS and MAS were meant to help the prisoners rehabilitate and reintegrate into society and not lead to an extension of their sentences previously imposed.

62     In order that the aggregate consecutive sentences (consecutive by operation of law) do not exceed the remaining portion of the duration of the remission order, I adjusted the sentence for the 50T enhanced sentence downwards from 444 days to 272 days as:

> 272 (50T enhanced sentence) + 261 (50Y sentence) = 533 days.

## Conclusion

63     The total sentence of seven years for the LT2 offence, 272 days of 50T enhanced sentence and 261 days for the 50Y offence of a serious breach of the mandatory aftercare conditions would adequately address the sentencing objectives as presented by the facts and circumstances of this case.

64     Norfarah has been in remand since 24 July 2019. As there is no impediment to the sentence being backdated, I hereby order the total sentence of imprisonment of seven years and 533 days to take effect from 24 July 2019.
