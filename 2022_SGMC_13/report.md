Criminal Law – Offences – Outrage of Modesty

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Taking additional evidence – Comparison of testimonial evidence of additional witness with her prior statutory declaration, and accused’s testimony at Remittal Hearing

9 February 2022

### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## Introduction

1       On 13 August 2021, the High Court in Criminal Motion 54/2021, ordered that this case be remitted to the trial judge to take further evidence pursuant to s 392(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). I will follow to flesh out these findings with more background information on the context of the additional evidence against salient aspects of the main trial in respect _of Public Prosecutor v Loh Siang Piow @ Loh Chan Pew_ SGMC 16 (hereinafter _Loh Siang Piow_ (main)), but it would be expedient to first set out the directions of Hoo Sheau Peng J at the aforementioned Criminal Motion which were

> Pursuant to section 392 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), this matter is remitted to the Trial Court for evidence to be taken on two issues raised in the Statutory Declaration of Ms Amelia Monteiro (“Ms Monteiro”) dated 21 October 2020.

>> (a)     **_the timing of the race that Ms Monteiro participated in on 31 July 2016_**: and

>> (b)     **_what Ms Monteiro heard the Applicant_** (the accused; Loh Siang Piow) say **_in the telephone call_**.

2       The High Court had provided that additional evidence be taken from Ms Monteiro, Mr Loh Siang Piow (“Mr Loh”), and one meet official, with a proviso that if a meet official was not available, for one participant or coach of the meet each by the prosecution and the defence.

3       As matters eventuated, the final measure was not required and additional evidence was taken from three witnesses at the remittal hearing, being Ms Monteiro, Mr Loh and Mr Nelson Tan Chin Siong (“Mr Tan”), who had been a meet official of the Singapore National Games 2016, as an event operations Manager for Singapore Athletics Association (SAA).

### Operation of section 392 CPC

4       Section 392 of the CPC provides:

> 392.(1)    In dealing with any appeal under this Part, the appellate court may, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by the trial court.

> (2)    Unless the appellate court directs otherwise, the accused or the accused’s advocate must be present when the additional evidence is taken.

> (3)    When the trial court has taken the additional evidence, it must send the record of the proceedings duly certified by it to the appellate court for it to deal with in the appeal.

> (4)     **_The trial court_** **_must_** **_also state_** **_what effect_** **_(if any)_** **_the additional evidence_** **_taken has on its earlier verdict._**

5       By the operation of section 392(4) of the CPC, it will also be my duty to evaluate the evidence and state whether the additional evidence would have affected the earlier verdict. In these findings, I will first set out the background facts and sequence of events, as well as Ms Monteiro’s testimony from both her statutory declaration and her court testimony, juxtapose these with the evidence of the accused and the designated meet official, and render my ruling, along with reasons on the impact (or absence thereof) that the additional evidence would have on the original verdict.

### The charges and the trial

6       The significance of the two issues of the timing of a sprint race that Ms Monteiro had participated in, and what she had overheard in a telephone call that Mr Loh had received while in his presence will be clearer if I set out the context within an event where the two had allegedly met each other on 31 July 2016. It would thus be _apropos_ to set out the background beginning with the fact that Mr Loh had been convicted before me in a State Court on 3 June 2020 on both charges that the prosecution had proceeded with:

> (i)     **MAC-904652-2017[^1]**

> “(Mr Loh is) charged that (he), on a Sunday between January 2013 and 17 March 2013 between at or around 12 p.m. and at or around 6 p.m. on a bench along the corridor leading to the gate below the spectators’ sitting area of Tampines Stadium located at 25 Tampines Street 82, Singapore, did use criminal force on one (Ms C), a female then aged 18 years old, to wit, by rubbing her vulva region over her clothing with his digit in the course of massaging the back of her thighs, knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty.”

> (ii)   **MAC-904653-2017** [^2]

> “(Mr Loh is) charged that (he), on or about 15 March 2013 between at or around 12 p.m. and at or around 6 p.m. on a massage bed inside an equipment room under the spectators’ sitting area of Tampines Stadium located at 25 Tampines Street 82, Singapore, did use criminal force on one (Ms C), a female then aged 18 years old, to wit, by rubbing her vulva region over her clothing with his digit in the course of massaging the back of her thighs, knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty.

### The appeal and the statutory declaration

7       On 22 July 2020, Mr Loh had been sentenced, on MAC 904652-2017, to a term of eight months’ imprisonment, and, for MAC 904653-2017, to a term of 13 months’ imprisonment. These would aggregate to a global term of 21 months’ imprisonment from a consecutive run of the two sentences[^3]. Mr Loh had appealed against both conviction and sentence vide MA 9695-2020-01. According to the prosecution, the accused had filed a criminal motion to admit a statutory declaration from Ms Monteiro on 4 June 2021, which was two months before the hearing of the case, and about a year from the date of Mr Loh’s conviction.

8       Ms Monteiro’s statutory declaration essentially referred to her meeting Mr Loh in the morning of 31 July 2016, at Choa Chu Kang stadium, where the latter had received a call. Ms Monteiro had formed an impression from the circumstances and substance of the call that Mr Loh had been speaking to a police officer. In her own words, Ms Monteiro states[^4]:

> 2    I make this statutory declaration in relation to the conviction of Loh Siang Piow @ Loh Chan Pew (Mr Loh). I have read the article in the Straits Times dated 3 June 2020 titled “_Veteran track and field coach Loh Chan Pew found guilty of molesting teenage athlete_: …I was shocked when I read in the article that the Court had apparently disbelieved Mr Loh that the police had revealed the victim’s names to Mr Loh before they had taken a statement from him.

> 3    I wish to state that **_I was physically beside Mr Loh at the moment Mr Loh had received the telephone call from the police on 31 July 2016_**. Based on what I heard, I wish to state that **_the police had in fact told Mr Loh the victims’ names during this call, which I believe to be before they had taken a statement from him_**.

### Significance of the contents of the call received by the accused

9       To afford a full contextual understanding, I will explain the evidential significance of what the police officer did, or did not, reveal to Mr Loh on 31 July 2016. The salient starting point from the sequence of events would be the day before, 30 July 2016, where the complainant in the proceeded charges (Ms C) and her fellow athlete (Ms W), who was the complainant in another three presently stood-down charges, had proceeded to file respective police reports against Mr Loh. The day after, PW11; Station Inspector Goh Teck Heng (IO Goh), who was the initial investigation officer assigned with the cases, had called Mr Loh on the morning of 31 July 2016, to inform him that police reports had been lodged against the latter, and that the accused had been required to “_come down to assist_” in police investigations.[^5] IO Goh, in his court testimony, had been explicit that he did not reveal the contents of the reports made by Ms C and Ms W over the phone. He had planned to see the accused “_in person and ask him directly_”[^6] to address the complainants’ accusations.

### Further interactions with IO Goh

10     After the call, Mr Loh had, in the afternoon of 31 July 2016, attended personally before IO Goh at an interview room in Tanglin police station but had pleaded that he was medically unwell and was not in a proper state of health to be interviewed. Mr Loh had enquired about the nature of the charges, and IO Goh had, according to the officer’s own account, remained circumspect in not revealing the identity of the putative victims, merely responding to the query that the complaints were in relation to Mr Loh being “_touchy towards the victims_”.[^7] IO Goh was, nevertheless explicit that he would not reveal the names of the putative victims; Ms C and Ms W, as he was ever conscious of the risk that a suspect of a sexual crime might “_go and destroy evidence or contact the victims_”. IO Goh recalled Mr Loh’s bid to impress him by stating that he was a vice president of the Singapore Athletic Association and had been a former superintendent of prisons. (Mr Loh had been a deputy superintendent (DSP) in the Prisons service). IO Goh acceded to Mr Loh’s request to delay his statement recording, and the latter was allowed to give his statement on 2 August 2016.

### Subsequent attendance before another investigation officer where accused tendered images of Ms C and Ms W in social and training settings

11     This exchange had become relevant when Mr Loh had subsequently appeared before **_another_** investigation officer IO Alan Khor on 2 August 2016, bearing images of Ms C and Ms W in an apparent bid to show the images, so as to refute the accusations of molest and to demonstrate that he had continued to maintain warm relations with the two female athletes both on and off the track. This included a photographic image of Ms C celebrating her birthday with Mr Loh. This production had, in turn, implicitly demonstrated an incongruous prescience that Mr Loh knew that Ms C was a complainant. Other images showed Ms W’s warm interactions with Mr Loh and her fellow trainees in a social setting. Mr Loh’s production of these images thus begged the obvious question of how Mr Loh would have **_known_** that Ms C and Ms W had been the complainants among his huge cadre of athletes, which encompassed girls’ secondary school (CHIJ Toa Payoh), junior colleges (CJC), tertiary educations and also a group of ‘private athletes’ who were unaffiliated to any educational institutions, if IO Goh had not told him during the phone call.

### Date and duration of the call between IO Goh and the accused

12     The exact time and duration of the call between the investigation officer and Mr Loh has been established by a defence exhibit[^8] which showed that Mr Goh had called Mr Loh at 9.24 am (for 3.4 minutes) and again at 9.28 am (for 2.4 minutes) on 31 July 2016. IO Goh had also spoken to Ms W around the time but had **_never_** spoken directly to Ms C, the complainant for the two proceeded charges, in the brief time he had handled the investigation before it was handed to IO Alan Khor, who had followed through to its conclusion. Hence any issues of testimonial credibility arising from Ms Monteiro’s new evidence would, from a retrospective analysis considering her account, potentially impact only the evidence of Mr Loh and IO Goh, and not affect the quality of Ms C’s evidence.

## Evidence of RH-W1 Amelia Monteiro

### What RH-W1 stated in the statutory declaration

13     There are differences between Ms Monteiro’s accounts in her statutory declaration and her court testimony. To allow a proper juxtaposition and assess the materiality of the variations, I will set out the material portions of her statutory declaration first. In relation to the events of 31 July 2016 she stated:

> 13    On 31 July 2016 (a Sunday), the Singapore National Games 2016 was held at the Choa Chu Kang Stadium. On that day, I was scheduled to run in the 200m race in the morning, and the 4x400m relay would be held that evening.

> …

> 15     **_My individual 200m race was held at around 9.15 am, and it was the only round_** because there were only 7 runners for the event. I had finished the race in the 4th place with a timing of 26.68 s.

> 16     **_After my race_**, I was walking around to relax and chat with people, I bumped into Mr Loh at the carpark beside the stadium. I had not made any prior arrangement to meet Mr Loh. I understand that Mr Loh was at the event because it was organised by the SA, and Mr Loh was then the vice president for competition planning.

> 17    I was happy to see Mr Loh. We started chatting, and **_I updated him about my earlier race_**. While we were chatting, Mr Loh broke off because he had to pick up a call. I was standing beside him at that point of time but **_I could not hear what was being said to him over the line, I could however hear what Mr Loh said quite clearly_**, and from his body language it appeared to me that Mr Loh was having a very important call. Mr Loh appeared very surprised, and it seemed to me as though he was repeating what the person was saying over the line**_, I remember the following details about_** **_the phone call_**:

>> (a)    I heard Mr Loh saying something along the lines of “_police? I have to go down to police station? What…what…what_?”

>> (b)    As I was still beside Mr Loh and observed him to be in shock, I tried to ask him what had happened. Mr Loh continued talking on the phone, and **_I heard him mention something about molest_**.

>> (c)    I then heard Mr Loh saying over the call something along the lines of “_who, no tell me…no, tell me…_ (Ms W_)…you mean my girl_ (Ms W)? _and who_ …_?_ (Ms C_)? You mean my girl_ (Ms W) _said that!?!?_

>> (d)    I then heard Mr Loh say a few times ”_ok_”, before the call ended.

> 18     **_After Mr Loh put down the phone, I asked him what happened. Mr Loh replied_** “(Ms W) **_and_** (Ms C) **_went to the police station”. I was very shocked as I understood this to mean tha_**t (Ms C) **_and_** (Ms W) **_had reported Mr Loh to the police about an alleged molest_**, but I did not know any further details. It was quite apparent to me that this was the first Mr Loh was hearing of this. He sounded in shock and disbelief during the call and I did not want to press further. I remembered asking the twins (Ms N) and (Ms T) who happened to be in the vicinity to come over, and I told them what just happened. They were both as surprised as I was.

> 19    I have a very clear recollection of this incident because it is so unexpected, and I also remember that a short while after **_the phone calls_** as described above…Mr Loh asked me to help him buy TOTO.

14     As can be seen from the reproduced passage above, Ms Monteiro had a strong impression of the event as she had subsequently “_after a short while_” post the tele-conversation been asked to buy TOTO for Mr Loh, for which she had registered surprise as this idiosyncratic request had come in “_after he has been informed by police that he was accused of molest_”.[^9] Strangely, in relation to the tele-conversation, Ms Monteiro used the singular term “_I remember the following details about_ **_the phone_** **_call_**”[^10] in a paragraph and “_a short while after_ **_the phone_** **_calls_** **_as described_**”[^11] in another.

## Court testimony of RH-W1

### RH-W1’s error in the timing of the race

15     Ms Monteiro stated that she had made an error in her account. She clarified that her references in paragraph 16 where she had mentioned having met Mr Loh **_after_** her race, where she had encountered him while “_walking around to relax and chat with people_” was incorrect. Ms Monteiro thus sought to amend her account stating that she had “_mixed up with the chronology of events that happened_” on what had happened on 31 July 2016 but was still certain that she had been at Choa Chu Kang stadium “_very early in the morning, … intending to run a morning race_”[^12]. The **_morning_** 200 metre sprint that she had intended to run had, however, been pushed to the **_afternoon_** of that day. She explained that it had not occurred to her that her event had been moved to the afternoon. Ms Monteiro also revealed that the race schedule showed that her 200-metre event would have been held at **10.15 am**, and hence her original account of meeting Mr Loh **_after_** a race and then encountering his taking a call, which was documented from IO Goh’s outgoing call records to have occurred from **9.24 am** and **9.28 am** that day, would also have been incorrect.

16     In relation to her interactions with Mr Loh at the material time, Ms Monteiro gave a version which cohered with her version in the statutory declaration. She indicated that she had seen Mr Loh at the car park of Choa Chu Kang stadium, and she had been used to his presence as an organiser of track related events. The two had started chatting, when the latter “_had received_ **_the_** _phone call_”. In the course of this call, she had noted Mr Loh looking “_very surprised and a bit agitated on the phone_”.[^13] The remaining portion will form the heart of her testimony, and I will thus reproduce the passage _verbatim_ to allow a better sense of the manner that the witness rendered her testimony on this critical aspect [^14]:

> And (_Mr Loh_) kept, uh, asking the person on the line to repeat what he was saying, kept saying like “_What? What? What_?” like that on the phone. And---and then, he started to ask the person on the phone to tell him like “_No, tell me_” and **_he was very persistent on the phone, like, asking the other person on the line to tell him. And then, after that, I heard him mention_**, _um_, **_the runners’ names_**, uh, some of my group, track and field runners’ names and it was something like, uh, (_Ms W_) and “You mean, my girl (_Ms W_) and who? (_Ms C_)? You mean my girl, (_Ms W_) said that?” Yes. And, um, so because during the phone call, I also heard him mentioned something about the police station and something about molest which …caught my attention at the beginning which is why I started to listen to the conversation. **_And then, after the entire conversation and looking at Mr. Loh’s body language and also_** his, uh**_, how his emotion was, I gathered that_**, uh, **_it was the police that was calling him_** and that, um, it was about two girls who to---the two runners whose names I have mentioned, uh, who said something about him and it was along the lines of molest. And after the phone call, when I asked him, **_he said_**, um, (Ms W) **_and_** (Ms C) **_went to the police station_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

## Cross-examination of RH-W1 Amelia Monteiro

### How witness RH-W1 erroneously believed her race was a morning race

17     At cross-examination, DPP Gail Wong had queried how Ms Monteiro had made such a profound error as to forget that her race had been in the afternoon rather than the morning, as she had stated in her statutory declaration. Focusing on the discovery of the error, Ms Monteiro admitted that she had been oblivious of this mistake for almost ten months from the time she had completed and signed her statutory declaration on 21 October 2020, up to the time that Mr Loh’s appeal had been scheduled to be heard on 13 August 2021[^15], where criminal motion 54 of 2021 had also been concurrently scheduled.

18     While Ms Monteiro had euphemistically attributed her epiphany to “_some discussion and going back to think about it_”,[^16] the mistake had indeed been brought up to her by Mr Loh’s counsel when they had held a meeting with her, and she had to be prompted by their query whether the race had been held in the morning or it had been another time.[^17] Ms Monteiro’s memory was only jotted when the accused’s solicitors produced a race schedule showing that the **_heats_** to the 200 metre sprint event that she had entered, were to be held in the morning, whereas the **_finals_** had only been scheduled to be run in the afternoon. When asked by DPP Wong whether she had any actual memory of what time she had run the race. Ms Monteiro conceded to relying only on what was based on the schedule as she had no memory “_what time of day I ran the event_”.[^18]

19     Ms Monteiro had based her error to an extrapolation from her having to be at Choa Chu Kang stadium early that morning, stating _“I say I believe it was held in the morning because I remembered I had to be there very early_”.[^19] Ms Monteiro added:

> …I just didn’t remember that the morning race was cancelled and we ran it to straight finals which was in the afternoon. To me, **_that small detail_** did not come to me when I was drafting this Stat Declaration, yah

> \[Emphasis added\]

### My preliminary observations

20     As a preliminary observation, Ms Monteiro, from the evidence that she gave, seemed somewhat prone to extrapolating her own expected conclusions, and where she would give her account of events seemingly from an impression of how she thought they **_should_** have occurred, rather than how they **_actually_** came to pass. She had thus inferred that she had run a morning race simply because she had been constrained to attend early in the morning at the stadium. In this event and her described _sequalae_ to the morning race that had never occurred, she had proceeded on her own accord to project events, and emotional or psychological states, that (by token of her mistake in timing) could **_not_** have occurred (which will be covered in the next part). These had occurred where a truly objective witness in her situation could have simply indicated she had no recollection of that part of the event, and not really be faulted as a credible witness given the fading of memories over the effluxion of time between July 2016 and October 2020. Her dismissal of her mistake in overlooking the cancelled heats as “_that small detail_” would lend to an impression that she might not have fully grasped the need to meticulously document her account, if she had expected her account to be accepted.

### Examination of described post-race actions

21     DPP Wong had next latched onto Ms Monteiro’s expressions of her post-race actions and state of mind where she had reported in the statutory declaration that “_(a)fter_ _my race, I was walking around to relax and chat with people_” and also “_I updated him_ (Mr Loh) _about my_ _earlier_ _race_”[^20] The DPP had also noted that her reference to the completion of the race at the preceding paragraph with timing and placing stated, would necessarily have meant that she had intended to refer to having completed the race, and which was proven to be wrong. It was notable that rather than concede the obvious that the impressions were rendered invalid following the proof of her actual race times, the witness had taken a rather more argumentative tack. Ms Monteiro had instead dismissed the DPP’s challenge to her having made three errors in the statutory declaration “_on the time when the race happened on the sequence of events and your actions and on the contents of (her) conversation with Mr. Loh_”[^21] with a lengthy exchange ensuing and finally concluding with Ms Monteiro’s dismissal of what she regarded as the DPP’s undue emphasis on what she described as “_the periphery_”: [^22]

> When I wrote this declaration, I just wanted to tell the Court, uh, the context of the situation why I was walking around, why I went to meet Mr. Loh, you know, like---because I just wanted to give a general idea of why I was there and why I was in conversation with Mr. Loh in the first place and that’s when the phone call came in. So, it’s just to give a context. I---**_I did not see the significance of_**, you know, uh, **_the timing of the race or_** like **_whether I was walking around to relax and chat with people_**, honestly. Because to me, **_what was most important was the contents of the conversation_** and **_these things that_** (DPP) Wong **_is asking me about is more of like the periphery which I didn’t pay a lot of attention to_**.

22     While I would understand Ms Monteiro, who was giving evidence in court for her first time, had expressed that her principal wish was to simply testify on the purported conversation that she had overheard while in Mr Loh’s presence that day, it was important for the court in a remittal hearing, in the exercise of its duties under section 392 (4) of the CPC, to hear the **_complete_** testimony of witnesses, so as to deliver properly considered views on the veracity of the new testimony, and thereby assess its impact on the verdict already given. In this regard, assessing a witness’ performance in the crucible of cross-examination was critical. Ms Monteiro’s reluctance to engage and respond to the DPP’s questions about her **_active representations_** of events that objectively could not have happened (i.e., a post-race walk-around to relax and chat, and an ‘updating’ to Mr Loh about a race that was yet to occur) would inevitably have an impact on my assessment of the quality of her evidence.

### RH-W1 had never sought to know who made the call, or what the caller had actually told Mr Loh

23     When cross-examined in relation to the call, Ms Monteiro stated that she had neither confirmed with Mr Loh **_who_** the caller had been, or **_what_** the caller had said but that in her mind, the caller had “_registered as a police officer_”.[^23] I found Ms Monteiro’s incurious behaviour within this factual matrix quite perplexing as she had admitted to spending an hour or so with Mr Loh before she had left to purchase his TOTO lottery tickets.[^24] Ms Monteiro was hardly a stranger or mere acquaintance but had trained under Mr Loh since December 2009, and it seemed peculiar that she had not seen fit to clarify the surrounding details of the perplexing call in the extended period she had remained in his presence. I will delve in greater detail on what Ms Monteiro had heard in a sequential juxtaposition with Mr Loh’s account in a later part of these findings.

## Evidence of RH-W2 Loh Siang Piow

### Sequence of events according to accused

24     The sequence of events as given by Mr Loh in his oral testimony in the remittal hearing has been set out for the purpose of comparison with Ms Monteiro’s account. This account begins in the morning of 31 July 2016, Mr Loh had received a call at “nine-something” in the morning from an officer based at Tanglin Police Station. The officer had asked “_Are you Loh Chan Pew_?” Upon Mr Loh’s affirmative response, he was told that he was needed “_to assist in the investigation_”. Mr Loh had demanded to know “_Over what case?”._ He had been told that “_two girls had lodged a report against_ (him)” and he was again told he was required to go down to the police station to assist in a police investigation.

### Accused’s exchange with IO Goh

25     At this point the police officer, who was yet to reveal his identity, had taken an adroit turn in his questioning and asked Mr Loh if he was a retired civil servant. After Mr Loh had confirmed that he had indeed retired in 2002 after 37 years’ service, the caller had asked on his own accord if Mr Loh had been a superintendent of Changi Prison. Mr Loh had replied in the affirmative and gone on to state his heading “_quite a number of drug centres_” and a minimum-security prison. The caller had then asked if Mr Loh was “_also the vice president of Singapore Athletic Association_”. To this, Mr Loh had confirmed to say, “_Yes, I was the vice president, in charge of organising and competition_.” The caller had then asked “_Mr. Loh, are you a school coach_?” to which Mr Loh had emphasized that he was not merely a school coach, but also “_the State coach_”. According to the accused, it was Mr Loh who had asked the officer to “_Please come to the point. What is it about?_”[^25] He had then allegedly demanded “_Look, you have to---I want you to tell me who are the people who complain about_ ---_that lodge report at me.”_

26     Mr Loh had continued to state[^26]:

> “I was in IJ Toa Payoh, a girls’ school for 14 years. I was in Primary school, Red Swastika, for 10 years. I was in CJC for 10 years. I was coach in SAS[^27] for five years. And I also in the NTU, National University, for almost 25 years. I have five, six hundred of girls under me. **_If you don’t tell me who were the girl_**(s) **_then I really I cannot come down to your police station_**.”

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Alleged revelation by IO Goh of the names of the accusers

27     At this point, Mr Loh recalled that the caller had put down the phone for some 20 to 30 seconds before calling him back and stating “_Mr. Loh, I am Senior Investigator Inspector Goh, I’m going to tell you, the two girl_(s) _who complained---who lodged a report against you that you have molested them were_ (Ms W) _and_ (Ms C).” Mr Loh stated that he was stunned, “_very hot_” and “_very agitated_”. He had raised his voice to say, “_Are you telling me that my girl(s)_, (Ms W) _and_ (Ms C), _are complain_ (sic) _about me, make a police report_?” and “_You’re very sure that”_ the two had proceeded as IO Goh had stated_._ At IO Goh’s confirmation, Mr Loh had agreed to meet him at the police station, adding that he remained “_really very hot_”, which I understood to be a colloquial expression that he was extremely angry.

### Whether the word “molest’ was ever mentioned during the phone call by the accused

28     There is a difference in Ms Monteiro’s account and that given by Mr Loh in his court testimony. This is in relation to Ms Monteiro’s impression that she had heard Mr Loh mention “_something about the police station and something about_ **_molest_**”[^28] in the course of the conversation that she had eavesdropped on. She repeats this again in her testimony to assert that she heard from Mr Loh’s side of the conversation that two trainee accusers had “_said something about him and it was along the lines of_ **_molest_**.”[^29]

29     It is notable that Mr Loh had **_never_** mentioned the word ‘_molest_’ in the entire length of the phone call, even where IO Goh had allegedly told him that Ms C and Ms W had lodged reports against him that the accused “_had molested them_”. Mr Loh’s account was his merely using the word ‘_complain_’ on his own end of the dialogue. To be clear, Mr Loh had related a subsequent episode that same morning at a time **_after_** the call where he had specifically complained of having to attend at a police station after being accused of acts of molestation. He had then told two track and field officials, apparently in Ms Monteiro’s presence that “_these two girls went to a police station to lodge a report saying that I_ **_molested_** _them_” [^30] This seemed to have been conflated by Ms Monteiro in her claim that she had heard Mr Loh use the word **_during_** the conversation. The witness had remained insistent when she was confronted on this by DPP Gail Wong that she had indeed heard such an utterance at an **_early_** part of the call[^31]:

> DPP:  So, would you agree with me that nothing in the words you’ve heard here if true---even if true, could lead you to conclude that (Ms C) had reported Mr. Loh to the police about molest. Would you agree?

> RH-W1:    Because I heard him say the word “molest”, **_something along_** …**_the lines of “molest” early in the phone call…_**

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Observation of accused’s testimony of his conversation with IO Goh Teck Heng

30     My views of the accused’s prior testimony in relation to his interactions with IO Goh Teck Heng have been set out in \[259\]-\[271\] of the grounds of decision for _PP v Loh Siang Piow_ (main). In relation to the iteration of his tele-conversation at the remittal hearing, I found Mr Loh’s rendition of how IO Goh had suddenly _segued_ from the solemn business of telling a suspect that he was to attend in an investigation for sexual offences against two trainees, to suddenly change the subject midstream, and engage in a convivial conversation about Mr Loh’s prior vocation as a Prisons officer and latter-day coaching career, rather implausible.

31     From Mr Loh’s account at the remittal hearing, IO Goh had become ever more deferential as the conversation went, to the point where Mr Loh appeared to take the dominant role in the exchange, going to the extent of expressing his anger (becoming “_very hot_”)[^32] and demanding that IO Goh reveal the identities of the two putative victims. IO Goh was then said to relent after a short pause, and made a second call to tell him the accusers were Ms C and Ms W.

32     As I have stated in my grounds[^33] in _PP v Loh Siang Piow_ (main), IO Goh was a police officer of 28 years’ standing, and had been in the investigation service for some 20 years at the time of his encounter with Mr Loh. Given this, he would be expected to have had a good grasp of his professional responsibilities. The narrated exchange[^34] also appeared to be rather long, considering that IO Goh’s outgoing call records show two fairly short run-times of 3.4 minutes and 2.4 minutes respectively. This would be especially so if one were also to take into account for the usual pauses, and time taken by two people who were unfamiliar with the other’s speech patterns, accent, intonation and cadences, to understand what that person was saying. I should add that there is no specific indication from Ms Monteiro’s version that she had eavesdropped on the two **_distinct_** calls that were logged, from her proximate vantage point, which was reportedly within a metre’s radius from Mr Loh. The call log[^35] had shown a separation of time of 28 seconds between the two calls, and this interval would have been quite obvious if Mr Loh had presumably ceased speaking after the first call, and then answered the second call some half a minute later.

## Evidence of RH-W3 Tan Chin Siong Nelson

33     The final witness at the remittal hearing was Mr Tan Chin Siong Nelson (“Mr Nelson Tan” or “Mr Tan”), an event operation manager for Singapore Athletics, who had worked at the Singapore Athletics Association for 11 years. Mr Tan was referred to the _Meet Programme Choa Chu Kang Stadium Singapore National Games 2016_[^36] and confirmed that he had been present in the stadium on 31 July 2016 as the competition director and explained how the start list for scheduled events was collated to list registrants for these various events. Interested athletes would register using Sport Singapore’s registration portal. For the event on 31 July 2016, Mr Tan recalled generating the start list on 29 July 2016. He explained that where nine or more persons had registered, he would have to generate preliminary heats events, to enable the top runners to proceed to the finals, which would only allow a maximum of eight competitors.

### Listing of RH-W1 in the Meet Programme

34     Turning to the _Meet programme_, Mr Tan confirmed that there had been nine entrants listed in the programme for Ms Monteiro’s individual sprint, which was **_Event 107_**, the women’s 200m open race. The programme showed five runners for the first heat and four for the second heat, with Ms Monteiro being listed to run the second heat race as runner 316. Mr Tan confirmed that Ms Monteiro had not been required to run any heat event, as fewer than nine of the athletes who had initially registered, had actually reported in the morning, and the finals event that she had run had taken place at **_5.30 p.m_**. on 31 July 2016.

35     Mr Tan was referred to a print-out titled _Singapore Athletics Assoc -Inter Club-Organisation Licence Singapore National Games 2016 -31/7/2016-7/8/2016 Choa Chu Kang Stadium_ which had shown Ms Monteiro having run the open-category 200 metre dash as **Event 113** and garnering a fourth-place finish at a timing of 26.68 seconds in a field of just **seven** athletes in the finals of the event**.** Mr Tan explained the different event numbers, stating that the initial event number (Event 107) had been for the heats, but the latter (Event 113) had been the number assigned to the finals.[^37]

36     Mr Tan stated that the reason there were only seven runners was because “(t)_wo of the participants did not turn up in the morning when_ (the registered runners were to) _report to the call room and the event is advanced to the final in the afternoon_.”[^38] He added that the run had been documented in the SAA’s _FinishLynx software_. The _FinishLynx_ software, when linked with the photo finish camera and another system known as the _Hy Tek Meet manager_, allowed the capture of highly precise images of the finish-line, and automatically annotated the race and event times.

## THE TIMING OF THE INDIVIDUAL RACE THAT MS MONTEIRO PARTICIPATED IN ON 31 JULY 2016

37     Having set out the premises in the foregoing, from the documentary and testimonial evidence of both the prosecution and defence, I will now directly address the two questions framed as the terms of reference for the remittal hearing. Beginning with the question of the timing of the race, the evidence from RH-W3 Nelson Tan in the preceding paragraphs, points conclusively to Ms Monteiro running just **a** **_single_** individual open-category 200 metre dash finals race event at **_5.30 p.m. on 31 July 2016_**, clocking 26.68 seconds and finishing fourth in a field of just seven runners, who were the only athletes who had shown-up for that event on 31 July 2016, even though there had been nine registrants. Ms Monteiro had been mistaken on her timing in her statutory declaration as she had referred to an untimed print out showing her race results for the finals of the individual 200 metre race that day and had seemingly proceeded on the wrong assumption that she would have had to run a morning heats event before advancing to the finals. For completeness, Ms Monteiro had also run a relay event that day, the four by 100 metre race, but that event had taken place **_after_** her open-category 200 metre dash.[^39]

## WHAT MS MONTEIRO HEARD THE ACCUSED SAY IN THE TELEPHONE CALL

### Precis of RH-W1’s oral testimony

38     Ms Monteiro’s version in her statutory declaration had already been on the record since its submission for CM 54 some two months before the date that the Criminal Motion and Magistrate’s Appeal were scheduled on 13 August 2021. The main purpose for the recording of (_inter alia_) Ms Monteiro’s oral testimony, would necessarily be to allow this testimony be part of the record, tested via cross-examination, and analysed against other accounts. I will therefore begin with a _precis_ of what Ms Monteiro stated in court on 20 December 2021.

39     Ms Monteiro’s evidence in this respect has been set out verbatim in a preceding part of these findings. The gist is that she had recalled Mr Loh, after receiving the call repeatedly ask the person on the line to repeat what he was saying, where she had repeatedly heard him ask: “_What? What? What_?” Thereafter she had noted that Mr Loh had started to ask the person on the phone to tell him more, using phrases like “_No, tell me_”, noting that he was very persistent on the phone in his quest for more information.

40     Ms Monteiro’s evidence was that she had thereafter heard Mr Loh mention the runners’ names, first Ms W then Ms C in their first names: “_You mean, my girl_ (Ms W) _and who?_ (Ms C)? _You mean my girl_, (Ms W) _said that_?” Ms Monteiro had then heard him mention “_something about the police station and something about molest …_**_at the beginning_**” which had caught her attention and prompted her to make a more concerted bid to listen in on the conversation. She had reasoned after listening to Mr Loh’s half of the conversation, and assessing his body language and emotional state, deduced that the call had come from the police, and that the two named runners had “_said something about (Mr Loh) and it was along the lines of molest_.”[^40].

### Cross-matrix of the three versions of events in RH-W1’s statutory declaration, her oral testimony and accused’s testimony at the remittal hearing

41     The prosecution had set out a cross-matrix schedule setting out the three accounts of Ms Monteiro’s statutory declaration, her oral testimony, and the accused’s own testimony in their closing submissions[^41]. After closely examining the prosecution’s schedule, I was convinced of the **_utility_** of such a cross-matrix table setting out the three versions side-by-side to allow a comparison for consistency of account against the sequence of events. I have therefore, using a similar template, created a table using inputs that I had separately gleaned from Ms Monteiro’s statement and the record of proceedings. My version of the cross-matrix table, which differs from the prosecution’s version by (_inter alia_) using direct quotes rather than commentary, and the omission of a row stating on the presence of other athletes, which I deemed unnecessary, is set out below:

### RH-W1’s testimony does not correspond with the accused’s account

42     The sequence of events as given by Ms Monteiro in her oral testimony differs from the account proffered by Mr Loh at the remittal hearing. Ms Monteiro’s account has the identity of the two trainees revealed at a relatively early phase of the conversation, where Mr Loh’s version had the revelation at the beginning of the second call, and where a full 3.4 minutes’ talk-time and a further 28 second interval had elapsed. Ms Monteiro’s distortion of the sequence can be seen in the following passage[^60]:

> …**_I just started chatting with Mr. Loh when he received the phone call_**. During then…it appeared to me that he was **_very surprised and a bit agitated_** on the phone. (_Mr Loh had kept asking the person on the line to repeat what he was saying and_) kept saying like “What? What? What?” like that on the phone. (T)hen, he started to ask the person on the phone to tell him like “_No, tell me_” and he was very persistent on the phone, like, asking the other person on the line to tell him. **_And then, after that, I heard him mention, ... the runners’ names_**, uh, some of my group, track and field runners’ names and it was something like, …(Ms W) and “You mean, my girl (Ms W) and who? (Ms C)? You mean my girl, (Ms W) said that?” Yes. And…so because **_during the phone call_**, **_I also heard him mentioned something about_** **_the police station_** **_and something about_** **_moles_****_t…_**

> **\[Emphasis added\]**

43     From the reproduced quote above, Ms Monteiro had placed the events close to the beginning of her encounter with Mr Loh as she had “**_just started_** _chatting with Mr. Loh when he received the phone call.”_ Unlike the calm emotional state that Mr Loh had sought to portray at the beginning of the call, Ms Monteiro had continued to state _“_**_During then_**_…it appeared to me that_ **_he was very surprised and a bit agitated_** _on the phone_”.[^61] Ms Monteiro’s account presented problems beyond the fact that Mr Loh had not mentioned ‘**_molest_**’ at any point of his conversation in his iteration of events. There is also the inversion of events, as Mr Loh’s **_ultimatum_** that he would not attend at the police station unless the officer had given him the names of his accusers, would have come first before the names of Ms C and Ms W were allegedly revealed to the accused. The sequence given by Ms Monteiro misses some key milestones which could have been difficult to forget if she were indeed just a metre away. Because of the sheer length of the exchange set out in Mr Loh’s own version, the context would have been clear even if she could only hear half the conversation. To recapitulate from the accused’s account:

> (a)     At the call that came at ‘nine-something’, the yet-to-be identified officer had asked “_Are you Loh Chan Pew_?”

> (b)     Upon Mr Loh’s affirmative response, the accused was told that he was needed “_to assist in the investigation_”.

> (c)     Mr Loh had demanded to know “_Over what case?”_

> (d)     The accused had been told that “_two girls had lodged a report against_ (him)” and he was to go down to the police station to assist in a police investigation.

> (e)     The caller had then taken a softer tone to ask if Mr Loh was a retired civil servant.

> (f)     Mr Loh mentioned his 37 years’ service before retirement in 2002.

> (g)     The caller had asked if Mr Loh had been a superintendent of Changi Prison.

> (h)     Mr Loh had replied in the affirmative referenced his heading “_quite a number of drug centres_” and a minimum-security prison.

> (i)     The caller had asked if Mr Loh was “_also the vice president of Singapore Athletic Association_”.

> (j)     Mr Loh had confirmed by saying “_Yes, I was the vice president, in charge of organising and competition_.”

> (k)     The caller had then asked “_Mr. Loh, are you a school coach_?”

> (l)     Mr Loh responded that he was not merely a school coach, but also “_the State coach_”.

> (m)     Mr Loh who had asked the officer to “_Please come to the point. What is it about?_” and had only made his first demand for the identities of the persons who had complained and lodged a report against him.

> (n)     Mr Loh had given a detailed disquisition of the sheer number of people he had trained, the institutions involved, and the years he had coached in those institutions, ending to claim that “_I have five, six hundred of girls under me_.”

> (o)     Mr Loh had then finally issued his ultimatum “_If you don’t tell me who were the girl_(s) _then I really I cannot come down to your police station_.”

> (p)     There had been a 28 second pause before the officer called back to reveal his identity as “_Senior Investigator Inspector Goh”_ and disclose the names of Mr Loh’s accusers.

> (q)     It had been only at this point that Mr Loh, having allegedly finally learnt the identities of the accusers, raised his voice to say, “_Are you telling me that my girl(s)_, (Ms W) _and_ (Ms C), _are complain about me, make a police report_?”.

### By his own account, the accused had not been persistent or imposed pressure to know the identities of the accusers from the beginning

44     Mr Loh’s account was the inverse of Ms Monteiro’s account in the sense that while Ms Monteiro had found Mr Loh to have been repetitive and ‘_very persistent on the phone, like, asking the other person on the line to tell him_” the identities of the two complainants, the accused had, for much of the first phone call remained relatively sanguine while he spoke to the person who subsequently identified himself as IO Goh. Mr Loh’s account conversely asserted that he had to ask the caller to “_Please come to the point. What is it about_?” when the caller had digressed into inquiring into various aspects of Mr Loh’s prior career and his professional history as a coach.

45     This prolonged series of questions had apparently spontaneously arisen after the caller asked Mr Loh if he had previously been a civil servant. In the exchange claimed by the accused, while the caller had meandered from his task of facilitating a police investigation to ask about Mr Loh’s career and coaching history, Mr Loh had seemed happy to respond, and even enthusiastically complicit in the then seemingly genteel discourse, in elaborating that he was “_in charge of organising and competition_” as vice president of the Singapore Athletics Association, his leading role in managing “_quite a number_” of drug rehabilitation centres, and that he was not merely a school coach but a “_State coach_”. None of these featured in Ms Monteiro’s account.

### Witness RH-W1 could not have missed accused’s ultimatum

46     From Mr Loh’s account, he had simply reasoned with the caller that he had, over the years trained many female athletes in a variety of institutions, before issuing the ultimatum that he “_really cannot come down to your police station_”. There had also been no indication from Mr Loh from his oral testimony that he had experienced any difficulty in hearing the caller, despite Ms Monteiro’s testimony that he had. Ultimately, I did not believe that Ms Monteiro could have missed Mr Loh’s ultimatum, coming as it did immediately **_after_** his protracted recitation listing the number of athletes, their schools and the years he had spent coaching each educational institution.

### From accused’s account, his display of anger and agitation had only arisen at the second call

47     Further, there would also have been an unmistakable change in **_tone_** in the subsequent part of the exchange, after the first call which ended with the ultimatum. Upon the resumption of the conversation with the second call, the caller’s alleged revelation of the names of the accusers would result in Mr Loh stating that “_I was stunned. I was very hot, I was very agitated…I raise my voice_”.[^62]

### RH-W1’s impression that the accused did not seem angry

48     As a rather stark contrast, Ms Monteiro, who stated that she had been with Mr Loh for “_roughly a bit more than an hour_”[^63] after the call, had stated that he seemed “_in shock_” after the revelation of the identities of the two accusers, but had still asked her to buy TOTO. When asked by DPP Gail Wong if Mr Loh had appeared “_jovial_” at the time he had asked her to buy TOTO, she had responded that Mr Loh was “_not jovial… at all_” but she had also noted that he had, contrary to Mr Loh’s account, **_not_** appeared angry.[^64] I would observe that Ms Monteiro’s statutory declaration was rather more sequentially coherent with the accused’s account, while the version she had offered at trial was discontinuous and, on occasion, at variance with Mr Loh’s oral testimony at the remittal hearing.

## WHAT EFFECT (IF ANY) OUGHT THE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE TAKEN HAVE ON THE COURT’S EARLIER VERDICT

49     The detailed narration and analyses of the evidence in the foregoing have been with a view to setting the basis of the answer to the question of what effect, if any, should this additional evidence taken from the three witnesses, have on the court’s earlier verdict, which was to find Mr Loh guilty as charged in respect of the two proceeded charges. As mentioned above, the trial court is, by operation of section 392 (4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, duty bound to complete the findings in a remittal hearing by indicating whether the additional evidence would be of such a nature as to affect the verdict.

50     In this respect the two areas which I propose to cover would be firstly, the question of whether Ms Monteiro could possibly have been at the scene at the time Mr Loh received the call, as to overhear one side of the conversation between Mr Loh and IO Goh. -The second would encompass the question of whether Ms Monteiro could be considered a **_credible_** witness, and in this regard, whether this witness has been both internally consistent and externally consistent, when juxtaposed with Mr Loh’s testimonial account and other aspects of documentary or circumstantial evidence. This would then lead to the final analysis of whether the additional evidence has done anything to change the complexion of the case, and possibly require the court to give pause to reconsider the soundness of its verdict.

### Whether it was possible for RHW-1 to have been present at the scene when the call by IO Goh was received by the accused

51     The prosecution has argued that a literal reading of Ms Monteiro’s statutory declaration would have meant that she would **_not_** have been in a position to have met Mr Loh at or before the time that IO Goh had made the two calls on 9.24 am and 9.28 am respectively to Mr Loh. This would have been literally true if she had, _per_ her claim in her statutory declaration, met Mr Goh **_after_** her run had the event occurred _per_ the schedule prepared by RHW-3, SAA event competition director, Nelson Tan. Mr Tan had scheduled the **_heats_** for the 200-metre dash open event to commence from 10.15 am[^65] with the finals to be run in the afternoon.

52     To be clear, Ms Monteiro’s original race timing of 9.15 am, as stated in her affidavit to be the time of her event, would have been, in any case, potentially problematic as the timing would have given her an extremely narrow window of under nine minutes to run the 200 metre race, leave the track and then encounter Mr Loh in the stadium carpark, outside the stadium **_before_** the time of the call at 9.24 am. Ms Monteiro had at the beginning of her examination-in-chief sought to correct the timing of the race from 9.15 am to 10.15 am, but added that she had belatedly realised that while the heats had been scheduled at the latter time,[^66] she had actually run the race in the afternoon, stating that she had “_mixed up with the chronology of events that happened on_ … _31st of July “_ as she recalled being at Choa Chu Kang stadium _“very early in the morning, ... intending to run a morning race_” which was “_pushed to the afternoon_”. So, she had “_not run the race in the morning_” at all[^67]. At the tail end[^68] of Ms Monteiro’s cross-examination, DPP Gail Wong produced conclusive proof that no heats had been run in the morning, and the open category 200-metre dash had been run as a straight final at 5.30 pm, with just the seven female contestants who had personally attended at the stadium to run the race.

53     In my judgment, while Ms Monteiro had been wrong about her timing in her statutory declaration that she had run her race at 9.15 am and DPP Wong had, via Mr Nelson Tan, produced images from the _Finishlynx_ system to show the race being actually run at 5.30 pm, her oversight did **_not_** necessarily mean that she **_could not_** have been in the vicinity of Choa Chu Kang stadium at or around 9.24 am on 31 July 2016. This would be on the basis of Mr Nelson Tan’s evidence that all registrants who intended to participate in an event would be required to report 30-40 minutes before their competitions to the call room, where their attendance would be marked.[^69]

54     Ms Monteiro had stated that she had she had been present at Choa Chu Kang stadium early in the morning. This presence would have been necessary for her to register her attendance for the 200-metre event. Given the mentioned cut-off for attendance of half an hour before the planned heats, she would not have known until 9.45 am (which was half-an-hour from the initially schedules heats for her individual event) that there was no need to run the heats as only seven contestants had turned up. Based on this I would rule that the encounter between Ms Monteiro and Mr Loh that morning, at or before IO Goh’s call at 9.24am, was **_within_** the realm of possibility.

### Whether RH-W1 was a credible witness

55     Notwithstanding the above, Ms Monteiro’s evidence was riven with internal and external inconsistencies.

### RH-W1’s failure to inquire about the identity of the caller is internally inconsistent with her stated actions in her statutory declaration and her oral testimony

56     In her court testimony, Ms Monteiro had indicated that she had not thought to ask Mr Loh for any more details after the call despite not knowing the identity of the caller. Her explanation was that she did not wish to “_trigger it anymore or I felt like it wasn’t my position to pry also_.”[^70] Ms Monteiro’s disinclination to inquire further or “_pry_” appears uncharacteristic with her actions in actively inquiring **_during the call_** about the situation that had transpired, in her statutory declaration and her oral testimony.

> (i)     In her statutory declaration[^71] she had made a bid to inquire after observing Mr Loh’s mental state:

>> b)    As I was still beside Mr Loh and observed him to be in shock, I **_tried to ask him what had happened_**. Mr Loh continued talking on the phone, and I heard him mention something about molest.

> (ii)     In her court testimony, she had, in her evidence in chief, actually asked Mr Loh the following:

>> And after the phone call, **_when I asked him_**, he said, _um_, (Ms W) and (Ms C) went to the police station.

### RH-W1’s evidence lacked specificity on the caller’s identity and the contents of the call

57     The prosecution has characterised Ms Monteiro’s evidence as “_classic hearsay_” which could not be relied upon to prove what the caller said.[^72] This was essentially true, as Ms Monteiro had never actually **_heard_** the voice of the caller. She was thus bereft of all clues as to the caller’s gender, or other audial cues that could be drawn from hearing the person speak, which would include linguistic fluency, or authoritativeness in speech which might have afforded a basis to sense that the speaker might be a police officer. She would also have had no idea of the age or ethnicity of the speaker and would be in no position to say if Mr Loh had indeed spoken to IO Goh, a middle-aged Chinese police officer, which was the defence’s case. Indeed, Ms Monteiro was not in a position to verify if the caller had spoken in the English language, although Mr Loh was heard by her to be responding in English[^73].

### RH-W1 had derived her information about the caller only from what she had been told by the accused and from observing his reactions during the call

58     All the information that could be gleaned would be from what Mr Loh would **_tell_** her about the caller, which was of course technically hearsay. In this respect, Ms Monteiro was further hampered by her inexplicable disinclination to check with Mr Loh on the identity of the caller, or even the actual substance of the call during the one hour or so she had remained by Mr Loh’s side after the call.

59     From her testimony, Ms Monteiro had based her impressions principally on what she had heard Mr Loh utter as well as the accused’s “_body language_” and also “_how his emotion was_”.[^74] She had gathered from Mr Loh’s utterance of the names of Ms C and Ms W to premise her conclusion that the caller had been a police officer who was calling him about the two runners named. This was in my mind, a massive leap of conjecture, made in circumstances where an objective and rational person would have sought clarification from her source, Mr Loh, during the extended period they were together.

60     Notably, Ms Monteiro agreed that she had heard Mr Loh utter Ms C’s name just **_once_** during the call[^75] but she had not heard Mr Loh state **_during_** the call, that Ms C had gone to a police station. He had only made the assertion **_after_** the call. It thus appeared that Ms Monteiro’s interpretation had been premised by her hearing certain key words uttered by Mr Loh such as “_molest_” (a word which Mr Loh himself does not admit to having used **_during_** the call) “_police_” and “_police station_”[^76] seemingly in isolation. Ms Monteiro had interposed these uttered words with her observation that Mr Loh had shown expressions of “_disbelief, betrayal_ (and) _shock_”[^77] but not anger, to form her impression that he had been speaking to a police officer. Other than the two unelaborated allusions made to the accused’s “_body language_”[^78], Ms Monteiro did not specify how Mr Loh’s “_body language_” would have prompted her to believe he had been speaking to a police officer. Given the above, I would agree with the prosecution’s expressed views[^79] that:

> (_Ms Monteiro’s_) ability to read (_Mr Loh’s_) body language and emotions is seriously questionable **_given her testimony that the Accused was not angry, contrary to the Accused’s own evidence both at the trial proper and in the remittal hearing_**, that he was very angry. There is no logic to the submission that the caller had uttered the victims’ names just because the Accused said them himself.

> \[Emphasis added\]

61     I would also agree with the prosecution’s contention that Ms Monteiro’s evidence lacked contextual underpinnings, given that the inputs from the call were fragmentary words or phrases by Mr Loh that she had overheard. The situation thus did not afford her any insight to **_why_** the words were uttered, and **_how_** their meaning might be different if **_both_** the question and response from both parties in the call had been heard by her. The one-sided conversation that she heard might have made it difficult for her to consider other possible explanations for what she heard. These considerations were well-articulated by the prosecution in their submissions[^80], with which I entirely agree:

> **_Context is important in understanding a conversation; without it, the conversation can be easily misinterpreted_**. In this regard, (Ms Monteiro) did not even seek to check with the Accused on the caller or the contents of the calls. **_Her understanding of the calls was based on her own presumptions_**. It is thus apparent that she had closed her mind to the possibilities that persons other than the police could have called the Accused, and on the contents of the telephone conversation.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Given the inconsistencies and limitations, RH-W1’s evidence had to be treated with caution

62     While Ms Monteiro had come across as an earnest and forthright individual, the limitations presented by the situation she faced could not be ignored. To re-capitulate, she had never directly heard the caller’s voice in the two calls that lasted under six minutes, and thus remained unaware of the gender of the caller. Nor was she in a position to explain any characteristics which would have placed the caller as a police officer, such as the tone, manner, and language he spoke. Given these limitations, she had merely extrapolated that Mr Loh had been speaking to a police officer from references to “_police station_” from a discussion where the two runners’ names were mentioned. Unsurprisingly, there had been inconsistencies between their two accounts, where she had also heard Mr Loh reference the word ‘**_molest_**’ in the call, which differed from Mr Loh’s account, where he had **_never_** used the word **_during_** the call.

63     The external inconsistencies between her account and Mr Loh’s version were even more marked in other respects. Ms Monteiro had Mr Loh being agitated from the start of the call, where Mr Loh’s version had been more of a progression, with an extended portion of the first call involving Mr Loh and the caller being engaged in an apparently convivial digression about Mr Loh’s past career as a senior prisons officer, his professional achievements in running drug rehabilitation centres and minimum-security prisons, as well as his special coaching appointments as a State coach. Again, I note that all this did not feature at all in Ms Monteiro’s account.

64     Most significantly, Ms Monteiro never heard Mr Loh’s ultimatum that he would not attend at the police station unless the officer had given him the names of his accusers. This was the central thrust of the defence’s case in their bid to persuade why a policeman of 28 years’ standing would depart from protocol of never revealing the identities of complainants before a statement had been recorded from the accused. Also significant was Ms Monteiro’s divergence that the interaction had involved just one long call, rather than the two calls with a 28 second separation, which was the defence’s case. Indeed, the differences, as listed in the foregoing were so profound that a case might be made that Ms Monteiro was listening in on an entirely different call altogether (as the prosecution has alluded in their submissions)[^81]. This possibility was all the more accentuated by Ms Monteiro’s inability to place the exact time of the call.

65     I should add that a major consideration of the case was Ms Monteiro’s inability to recall that her race had been held at 5.30 pm on 31 July 2016, rather than her earlier indication of 9.15 am in her statutory declaration. Ms Monteiro’s assertion “(a)_fter my race, I was walking around to relax and chat with people”_ before encountering Mr Loh to debrief him about her race, in her statutory declaration, amounted to Ms Monteiro confidently extrapolating two events that could, with due respect, have only existed in her imagination (given that the race was yet to be run in the morning, and Mr Loh would have left Choa Chu Kang stadium for Tanglin police station well **_before_** the actual completion of the individual 200 metre open category sprint in the late afternoon/early evening of 31 July 2016).

66     All considered, Ms Monteiro’s accounts in her statutory declaration and her court testimony, already limited by her being only able to hear one side of her conversation, was further compromised by a number of internal and external inconsistencies, which have been explained in detail in the foregoing.

67     Given this, and in particular; the fact that her account did not cohere with Mr Loh’s version of events in important respects, Ms Amelia Monteiro’s testimony must be deemed to be unreliable and, should be treated with caution. There thus has been no additional convincing evidence tendered in this proceeding to rebut the prosecution’s case that Mr Loh had, when he attended the police interview two days after the athletics meet with photographic images of Ms C and Ms W, prescient knowledge of the identities of the two complainants which he could not properly account for.

### Whether the additional evidence should affect the verdict

68     Given the analysis above, there would be, in my judgment, no basis to conclude that the additional evidence that was recorded in the remittal hearing, should have any effect on the guilty verdict pronounced on the accused at the main trial. Thus, having heard the evidence of the witnesses produced for the remittal hearing, I conclude that the additional evidence that was recorded in the said hearing would not have had any effect on the verdict given at the main trial.

### Appreciation

69     In concluding, I would like to thank both defence counsel and the DPPs for their thoughtful and cogent submissions, which were of significant assistance, and I also acknowledge their role in facilitating the expedition of the trial portion of the remittal hearing, which was completed in just two days in 20-21 December 2021.
