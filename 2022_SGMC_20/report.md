### District Judge Lau Qiuyu:

1       The accused, Mdm Wang Xuyi, claimed trial before me to a total of four charges – one charge for voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “PC”), one charge for attempting to voluntarily cause hurt under s 323 read with s 511 of the PC, and two charges for using insulting words towards a public service worker under s 6(1)(_a_) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (the “POHA”).

2       Having heard the testimonies of the Prosecution’s witnesses and that of the accused, and having considered the evidence tendered at trial and parties’ submissions, I found the accused guilty of all four charges and convicted her accordingly.

3       After convicting the accused, I imposed a total sentence of one week’s imprisonment and a fine of $5,000 (in default thereof, eight days’ imprisonment) as follows:

4       The accused has lodged an appeal against both conviction and sentence and I set out the reasons for my decision below. A stay of execution on the sentence was allowed further to the lodging of the appeal. The accused is presently on bail pending the appeal.

## The charges

5       The four charges are reproduced in full below:

> The first charge

> You… are charged that you, on 16 May 2020, at around 11:04pm, at the Accident and Emergency Department of the Changi General Hospital, located at No. 2 Simei Street 3, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to Nurul Neeza Binte Mohd Jumain, _to wit_, by hitting her shoulder several times, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> The second charge

> You… are charged that you, on 16 May 2020, at around 11.05pm, at the Accident and Emergency Department of the Changi General Hospital, located at No. 2 Simei Street 3, Singapore, did attempt to voluntarily cause hurt to Nurul Neeza Binte Mohd Jumain, _to wit_, by attempting to bite her, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 read with section 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> The third charge

> You… are charged that you, on 16 May 2020, at around 9pm, at the Accident and Emergency Department of the Changi General Hospital, located at No. 2 Simei Street 3, Singapore, did use insulting words towards a public service worker, namely Dr Magneline Ang Ke Xin, a medical doctor with the Changi General Hospital, in relation to the execution of her duty as such public service worker, _to wit_, by calling her “stupid”, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 6(1)(_a_) punishable under section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed).

> The fourth charge (as amended at close of Prosecution’s case)[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> You… are charged that you, on 16 May 2020, at around 11pm, at the Accident and Emergency Department of the Changi General Hospital, located at No. 2 Simei Street 3, Singapore, did use insulting words towards a public service worker, namely Dr Magneline Ang Ke Xin, a medical doctor with the Changi General Hospital, in relation to the execution of her duty as such public service worker, _to wit_, by calling her “shen jing bing” in Mandarin, which means “crazy” in English, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 6(1)(_a_) punishable under section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed).

## The Prosecution’s case

6       The following six Prosecution witnesses were called at trial:

7       Of the six Prosecution witnesses, the Prosecution had initially intended to call only the first four (_ie_, PW1 to PW4).[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) However, just before the Prosecution was about to close its case after leading evidence from PW1 to PW4, the accused queried if two other witnesses, namely PW5 and PW6[^3], would be coming to court. To this, the Prosecution’s position was that they would not be calling PW5 and PW6, but would assist, and did indeed assist, to check on their availabilities for them to be offered to the accused.[^4] I explained this to the accused, and asked if she wished to call them as the Defence’s witnesses. In response, the accused expressed reservations and difficulties with calling the two witnesses. In the same breath, she stated that she “wanted to see these \[two\] people.”[^5] Eventually, the Prosecution decided to call PW5 and PW6 as well, so as to afford the accused the “full opportunity to cross-examine them”.[^6] Nonetheless, the Prosecution’s position was that it was not relying on PW6’s evidence for its case, and had only called PW6 so that the accused could “effectively cross-examine him”.[^7]

8       For completeness, the Prosecution also invited the accused to confirm the identities of any further witnesses that she wished to call, so that the Prosecution may similarly propose to have them called as Prosecution witnesses for the accused to cross-examine. However, the accused said that this was not necessary, and she did not wish to summon other witnesses apart from PW5 and PW6, who were there with her on the material day.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

### Background facts

9       The accused attended at the Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) on the material day, 16 May 2020. PW1 is Dr Magneline Ang Ke Xin, a doctor working in the Accident & Emergency Department (“A&E Department”) of CGH on that same day. PW1 is a medical doctor registered with the Singapore Medical Council and employed by MOH Holdings Pte Ltd.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) At about 6 pm, PW1 called the accused into the consultation room. During the consultation, there were disagreements between PW1 and the accused on the treatment and tests required. PW1’s evidence was that she had “faced a lot of resistance from \[the accused\] as \[the accused\] was quite fixated on the treatment that she wanted.”[^10] In particular, the accused had insisted on antibiotics, which PW1 did not deem necessary at that point. The accused also disagreed with PW1’s professional recommendations for the accused to undergo various investigations.

10     PW1 expended considerable time to convince the accused to proceed with the investigations, which the accused eventually agreed to undergo. However, the accused subsequently changed her mind. PW1 thus sought to persuade the accused a second time to go for the investigations, and further engaged the help of a senior doctor and the medical registrar on call that day to explain the options to the accused. Despite the opinion of the three doctors, the accused remained dissatisfied with the options provided, and insisted on being prescribed antibiotics.

11     It was against the backdrop of these disagreements that the offences arose.

### Evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses

#### The third charge

12     After the exchange with the medical registrar, PW1 told the accused to take some time to consider her options. Thereafter, PW1 returned to her consultation room to see another patient.

13     PW1 testified that around 9 pm, she was just finished with the consultation of another patient when the accused “proceeded back into \[PW1’s\] room” before she even called for the accused.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) This room referred to the consultation room in the A&E Department of CGH.[^12] The accused informed PW1 that she was “just going to leave”, and before the accused closed the door to PW1’s room, the accused had called PW1 “stupid”.[^13] According to PW1, the exact words that the accused had said to her were “you are stupid”.[^14] PW1 “felt that the comment was very insulting.”[^15]

14     As this occurred in PW1’s consultation room, she did not think there was anybody else in the vicinity who heard the accused’s comment.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) It had just been PW1 and the accused in the consultation room at the material time.[^17]

#### The fourth charge

15     Thereafter, PW1 thought that the accused had left the A&E department and PW1 continued with what she was doing with her other patients. However, at about 9.30 pm, PW1 was informed by the senior doctor that he had spoken to the accused, who was now keen for admission. The senior doctor asked that PW1 proceed with the paperwork. He further told PW1 that PW1 need not speak to the accused again as he had already spoken to her. As such, PW1 proceeded to print the necessary forms for admission and passed them to the nurses to process the accused’s admission.

16     Sometime between 10 pm to 11 pm, PW1 was informed again that the accused was not keen to be admitted and that the accused wanted to speak to PW1. PW1 thus proceeded to the admissions counter to speak to the accused to understand her concerns. PW1 testified that the accused was very agitated at this point. The accused maintained that she did not want to be admitted and queried PW1 on why the admission process was done. PW1 again tried to explain the situation to her, and at around 11 pm, the accused said the exact phrase “ni sheng jing bing” in Mandarin to PW1, which meant “you are crazy” in English.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

17     PW1 testified that this comment was made by the accused very loudly in front of the general public at the admissions counter. There were therefore several people around who had heard the same, including the administrations counter staff, the nurses in the vicinity, and the general public seated at the admissions counter, who turned around to look at PW1 and the accused. Upon hearing the comment, PW1 felt insulted and felt that the accused was threatening her. Further, the circumstances of the incident led PW1 to feel that her image had been affected in front of the general public. [\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

#### The first charge and second charge

18     As a result of the events at the admissions counter (as set out at paragraphs 16 to 17 above), PW1 decided that she could not proceed with a further consultation with the accused and asked that the nurses call the security officers over.

19     Consequently, three AETOS auxiliary police officers, namely PW3, PW4 and PW5 (collectively, the “APOs”), were deployed to the admissions counter further to the call for assistance.

20     PW4 is Ms Nurul Neeza Binte Mohd Jumain, the victim named in the first and second charges. She said that at around 10.45 pm, she was activated by PW3 on her walkie-talkie as PW3 needed assistance at the admissions counter. When she arrived, she saw that PW3 and PW5 were already attending to the accused. PW3 and PW5 then briefed PW4 of what happened.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) PW4 testified that the APOs were escorting the accused out of the hospital as the accused had refused to take medical treatment and was making public nuisance.[^21]

21     As the APOs were escorting the accused out of the hospital, the accused raised her mobile phone. The APOs and the accused were still within the A&E Department of CGH at this point.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) The accused’s action appeared to the APOs that she was taking a picture or a video of them.[^23] The APOs thus covered the camera of the mobile phone to prevent the accused from doing so, as videos or any recordings were not permitted in the A&E Department. Following this, the accused became “a bit aggressive” and started hitting PW4 on her “left shoulder a few times”, “around 3 to 4 times”. PW4 testified that the accused had used her palm to hit PW4’s left shoulder. As a result of this, PW4 felt “a bit of soreness and redness”, though PW4 did not seek any medical treatment for her injuries.[^24]

22     The APOs then let the accused sit, to calm her down. PW3 and PW4 also held on to the accused’s hands to prevent further instances of getting hit by the accused.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) While the accused was seated, the accused attempted to bite PW4, although the accused failed to do so as PW4 had let go of her hand from the accused.[^26] PW4 testified that the accused was “pulling down her mask and tried to bite” PW4. At the time of the attempted biting, PW4 said that the accused’s mask had been at the accused’s chin level.[^27] PW3 also saw that the accused had opened her mouth and tried to bite PW4.[^28]

23     A CCTV footage of the exchange between the APOs and the accused at the A&E Department of CGH was tendered through PW2 and marked as P1. PW2 is Ms Tan Pei Ling Pamela, the investigation officer who obtained a copy of P1 from CGH. The accused did not object to the admission of P1.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

## Amendment of the fourth charge and recall of PW1

24     The Prosecution made an application to alter the fourth charge at the close of its case, pursuant to s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”). The relevant portion of the pre-amended fourth charge had read:

> … in relation to the execution of her duty as such public service worker, _to wit_, **by calling her “crazy”**…

> \[emphasis added in bold and underline\]

25     Based on the evidence of PW1 at trial, the Prosecution sought to amend the fourth charge to reflect that the words “crazy” as stated in the pre-amended charge were uttered in Mandarin, as well as to state what the Mandarin words were.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) The Prosecution’s position was that it was making the amendment to ensure consistency between the Prosecution’s witnesses and the charge against the accused.[^31]

26     In response to the Prosecution’s application, the accused indicated that she did not think there was a need to do so, and that the charge was baseless.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

27     Having considered the evidence before the court and the stage of proceedings at the time the Prosecution’s application was made, I allowed the application for the fourth charge to be altered as follows:

> … in relation to the execution of her duty as such public service worker, _to wit_, **by calling her “shen jing bing” in Mandarin, which means “crazy” in English**…

> \[emphasis added in bold and underline\]

28     The altered fourth charge was read and explained to the accused, who maintained a plea of not guilty. I highlighted s 131 of the CPC to the accused and asked if she would like to recall any witness pursuant to that section. The accused indicated that she would like to recall PW1 to give evidence on the altered fourth charge. I allowed the accused’s application. PW1 was recalled to the stand and the accused cross-examined PW1 with reference to the altered charge.

## Close of Prosecution’s case

29     After the court heard evidence from PW6 (who was called by the Prosecution pursuant to the accused’s request), the Deputy Public Prosecutor Mr Teh again queried the accused on whether she wished to call any further witnesses to which the Prosecution might assist. The accused confirmed that there were no further witnesses that she wished to call.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

30     In the premises, the Prosecution proceeded to close its case. As I was satisfied that there was some evidence, not inherently incredible, that satisfied each and every element of the four charges, I called upon the accused to give evidence in her own defence. The accused elected to give evidence.

## The Defence’s case

31     The accused was the sole witness for the Defence. The accused tendered a total of 11 exhibits, which were marked and admitted into evidence as D1 to D11 respectively:

### The accused’s evidence

32     The accused was born in Shanghai. She is a registered architect in China and is in the architecture design industry. She came to Singapore in 1998 and continued to be in the architecture field until 2018.

#### The third charge and fourth charge

33     The accused did not dispute that there were disagreements between herself and the doctors in CGH (including PW1) on the treatment plan. The accused testified that she did not think it was necessary for her to do an X-ray examination or the series of tests which PW1 had wanted her to undergo. She also disagreed with PW1’s recommendations on the use of steroids in the treatment, owing to an allergy which the accused suffered from.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

34     The accused conceded that she might “have said some words which maybe \[_sic_\] hurting the doctor”, although she denied saying “shen jing bing” (which means “crazy” in English) to PW1. She sought to explain that the meaning of words would differ in different areas, notwithstanding that they were all in Mandarin. For example, in Jiangnan, Shanghai (where she came from), one would use “shi san dian” to describe “crazy”. In contrast, the equivalent phrase in Beijing would be “ah pai uh”. PW1 might therefore have misunderstood the accused owing to the differences in language.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) In cross-examination, the accused elaborated that when one scolded someone as a “shen jing bing”, there “are a lot of meanings to it”. It might be a vulgarity, it might be a scolding, or it might mean that the person is diagnosed with a medical illness. Nonetheless, the accused accepted that one would usually interpret “shen jing bing” to mean crazy.[^36]

35     As regards the word “stupid”, the accused said that this could similarly have been a misunderstanding.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) In cross-examination, while she maintained that she had “never said this”, she observed that the word “stupid” could be used in a joking context and “\[might\] not necessarily be scolding another person”. Instead, it could be used to “bring the relationship between different people closer.” The use of the word “stupid” is different in “different scenarios and environment.”[^38]

36     In re-examination, the accused highlighted that there were no witnesses who saw her scolding PW1 with the insulting words, and the allegations should therefore not be valid.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

#### The first charge and second charge

37     The accused denied hitting and attempting to bite PW4. Instead, the accused alleged that it was the APOs who were attacking her and grabbed hold of her hands. In support, she tendered D9 to show that her hands were red and swollen as a result of the APOs grabbing her with “great strength”.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40) The accused testified that she felt very frightened when the APOs attacked her. She said that she could not move at all as the APOs were grabbing hold of her hands. Thereafter, a man “stretched his hand from behind and placed it on \[her\] chest area”. In response, she grabbed hold of her right breast and shouted molest. It was only after she shouted about three times that he released his hand.[^41]

38     When the police officers arrived at CGH, the accused relayed this incident of molest to them. Her statement was taken by PW6, who was the on-duty investigation officer attending to the incident at CGH. According to PW6, the accused had alleged that her breast was touched by the APOs during the incident.[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42)

39     It was the accused’s testimony that during the statement recording, PW6 “kept telling \[her\] to reduce big matter to small and small matters to not \[_sic_\], and asked \[her\] not to proceed.”[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) PW6 denied this in cross-examination.[^44] The accused added that PW6 told her that he would settle her medical bills and she did not need to pay. The accused tendered P4, which was the tax invoice from CGH, in support of this. Again, PW6 denied this in cross-examination.

40     For the first charge, the accused denied that the CCTV footage in P1 (which had shown her swinging her hands up and down) meant that she had hit PW4. In cross-examination, this specific portion was played to the accused.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45) The accused admitted that her arm could be seen to be raised at least three times. However, she explained that this was just a “habitual action of movement” and she was not hitting anyone. She had pulled her hands backwards in response to the APOs grabbing hold of her hands.[^46]

41     For the second charge, the accused was shown parts of the CCTV footage in P1 (during cross-examination) where her mask appeared to be below her mouth. The accused said that she could not see whether her mask was below her mouth and did not know whether there were points during the incident where her mask was worn below her mouth.[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47) The accused was also shown a portion of P1 where she had lunged forward towards PW4.[^48] The accused explained in cross-examination that as the APOs had grabbed both of her hands, she could only use her head to hit PW4’s arm. As such, she lunged forward to lower her gravity to protect herself. This was her natural instinct.[^49]

## My decision

### Finding of guilt

#### The third charge and fourth charge

42     Both the third charge and the fourth charge relate to an alleged offence under s 6(1)(_a_) of the POHA, which reads:

> (1)    An individual or entity that by any means —

>> (_a_)    uses any indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour;

> … towards or to a public servant or public service worker (called in this section, except subsection (1A), the victim) in relation to the execution of the duty of the public servant or public service worker, shall be guilty of an offence.

43     To sustain a conviction, the following elements of the offence must be established: (a) the accused used insulting words; (b) the insulting words were used towards a public service worker; and (c) in relation to the execution of the duty of the public service worker.

44     As regards the definition of a “public service worker”, ss 6(5) and 6(6) of the POHA provide:

> (5)    In this section —

>> … “public service worker” means an individual who belongs to a prescribed class of employees or workers that provides any service which is essential to the well-being of the public or the proper functioning of Singapore, as prescribed under subsection (6).

> (6)    For the purposes of the definition of “public service worker” in subsection (5), the Minister may, by order published in the _Gazette_, prescribe the classes of employees or workers and the services provided by them.

45     The relevant order for the purposes of the definition of “public service worker” under s 6(5) of the POHA is the Protection from Harassment (Public Service Worker) Order 2014 (the “Order”). In particular, paragraph 1 of the Schedule to the Order prescribes the following class of employees or workers and services provided as falling within the said definition:

> A healthcare professional providing healthcare services to patients at a public healthcare institution, with the permission of or under contract with —

>> (_a_)    MOH Holdings Pte. Ltd.; or

>> (_b_)    a cluster HQ or its subsidiary, which owns or operates the public healthcare institution.

46     It was not in dispute that PW1 (_ie_, the named victim in the third charge and the fourth charge) was a doctor working in the A&E Department at CGH on the material day, 16 May 2020. PW1 gave evidence that she is a medical doctor registered with the Singapore Medical Council and employed by MOH Holdings Pte Ltd. It was clear to me that PW1 was a “public service worker” within the definition of s 6(5) of the POHA.

47     The issues to be decided by the court in respect of the third charge and fourth charge are as follows:

> (a)     Did the accused use “stupid” and “shen jing bing” towards PW1 at around 9 pm and 11 pm respectively?

> (b)     If so, were the words “stupid” and “shen jing bing” used towards PW1 in relation to the execution of her duty as such public service worker (_ie_, doctor)?

> (c)     Were the words “stupid” and “shen jing bing” insulting?

48     Given the overlap between the first two issues, these will be dealt with together first before the third issue.

##### (1)   Did the accused use “stupid” and “shen jing bing” towards PW1 in relation to the execution of PW1’s duty?

49     Both the Prosecution and the accused primarily relied on oral evidence. PW1 testified that the accused used “stupid” and “shen jing bing” towards PW1. The accused denied this. Much would therefore depend on the credibility of the main witnesses, PW1 and the accused.

50     In evaluating credibility, I had regard to the principles laid down in _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span> (at \[9\]). I considered each witness’s demeanour, internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of their evidence, and external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of their evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

51     Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, I found PW1 to be a credible witness. PW1 was forthcoming in her evidence and testified candidly about what transpired while she was on duty on 16 May 2020 at the A&E Department of CGH, the disagreements that the accused had with PW1 and the two other doctors on the recommended treatment options, which then led to the accused calling PW1 “stupid” and “shen jing bing” at around 9 pm and 11 pm respectively. PW1 was clear in her evidence and testified unhesitatingly on the stand the exact words in verbatim that the accused had said to her and the locations where they said. PW1’s evidence was also unshaken during cross-examination where she maintained her version of events despite questioning from the accused. Accordingly, I accepted PW1’s evidence as regards the events on the day of the alleged offences.

52     In my assessment, there was no reason or motive for PW1 to make false allegations against the accused. PW1 had not known the accused prior to the incidents. PW1’s first and last interactions with the accused had been at the A&E Department of CGH when the accused was allocated to be PW1’s patient.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) PW1 was simply carrying out her duties as a medical doctor by providing her professional opinion and recommending that the accused proceed with various investigations to obtain a reasonable and appropriate diagnosis.

53     PW1’s evidence in relation to the second incident of “shen jing bing” at around 11 pm was also broadly consistent with the evidence of the APOs (_ie_, PW3, PW4 and PW5). The APOs all testified that around 11 pm, they had witnessed the accused approach PW1, where the accused scolded PW1 in Mandarin in an angry manner and tone.[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51)

54     On the other hand, I found the accused’s evidence to be lacking in credibility and it was difficult to rely on the same. Throughout the course of the trial, the accused presented contradictory positions and evidence on the issue of whether she had used “stupid” and “shen jing bing” towards P1. I cite a few examples below in support of this:

> (a)     In the accused’s cross-examination of PW1, the accused first said that she had scolded PW1 “due to the medication”. Shortly after, she denied scolding PW1 and asserted that she did not remember saying “you are stupid” to PW1.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) The accused subsequently explained in her examination-in-chief that the term “stupid” could have been a misunderstanding.[^53]

> (b)     In the accused’s examination-in-chief, she testified that she might have said some hurtful words to PW1, for which the accused would apologise to PW1. However, she denied saying “shen jing bing”. Notwithstanding this, the accused proceeded to explain that “shen jing bing” might have different meanings according to regions and PW1 could thus have misunderstood her. This appeared incongruous to me – if the accused had indeed not said “shen jing bing” to PW1, the issue of any misunderstanding would not even arise. There would have been nothing said for PW1 to misunderstand.

> (c)     Subsequently, during the accused’s cross-examination, she said that she could not say for sure what the phrase “shen jing bing” meant and that she was not too sure what the phrase was.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) This was despite the fact that the accused had herself, in examination-in-chief, pointed to how the phrase “shen jing bing” would be expressed in other regions of China, namely, “shi san dian” in Shanghai (where she was from) and “ah pai uh” in Beijing. It thus seemed curious for the accused to then allege ignorance of or unfamiliarity with the meaning of “shen jing bing”.

> (d)     When pressed further by Mr Teh on the accused’s understanding of the phrase “shen jing bing”, the accused then reverted to her explanation that “shen jing bing” could take various meanings and might be understood differently. The accused eventually conceded that one would usually interpret “shen jing bing” to mean crazy.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)

55     All considered, the totality of the evidence led me to conclude that the accused did use the words “stupid” and “shen jing bing” to PW1 at around 9 pm and 11 pm on 16 May 2020 respectively, in the A&E Department of CGH. These words were said to PW1 in relation to the execution of PW1’s duty as a medical doctor on the said day, while PW1 was attending to the accused as a patient.

##### (2)   Were the words “stupid” and “shen jing bing” insulting?

56     The ordinary meaning of “insulting” is “disrespectful” or “scornfully abusive” (see _Public Prosecutor v Chan Kong Thoe_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 150</span> at \[23\], citing the Oxford Living Dictionary).

57     The accused had uttered the words “stupid” and “shen jing bing” (which means “crazy” in English) towards PW1 further to the accused’s disagreement and unhappiness with PW1’s recommended investigative tests. As the accused admitted, she was “angry because there was no solution given” to her and she had been “in the hospital for a long time”.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) The accused was “angry with \[PW1\] because \[the accused\] disagreed with \[PW1’s\] medical opinion”.[^57] In my judgment, the two uttered words of “stupid” and “shen jing bing” were evidently disrespectful towards PW1’s position as the accused’s attending doctor and served to insult PW1.

##### (3)   Conclusion on the third charge and fourth charge

58     I found that the Prosecution had proven its case against the accused on the third charge and fourth charge beyond a reasonable doubt. In the premises, I found the accused guilty of the third charge and fourth charge, and convicted her accordingly on these two charges.

#### The first charge and second charge

59     The first charge relates to an offence under s 323 of the PC, whereas the second charge relates to an offence under s 323 read with s 511 of the PC.

60     Section 323 of the PC reads:

> Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 323A or 334, voluntarily causes hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.

61     The definition of “voluntarily to cause hurt” and “hurt” are found in s 321 and s 319 of the PC respectively. These are set out below:

> **321**.    Whoever does any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person, and does thereby cause hurt to any person, is said “voluntarily to cause hurt”.

> **319**.    Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt.

62     Section 511 of the PC explains when one has attempted to commit an offence:

> **511.**—(1)    A person attempts to commit an offence punishable by this Code or by any other written law who, with the intention of committing that offence takes a substantial step towards the commission of that offence.

> (2)    For the purposes of subsection (1), an act is a substantial step towards the commission of an offence if it is strongly corroborative of an intention to commit the offence …

63     The issues in relation to the first charge are as follows:

> (a)     Did the accused hit PW4 on the shoulder several times?

> (b)     If so, was hurt caused to PW4?

> (c)     If so, did the accused hit PW4 on the shoulder several times with the intention of causing hurt to PW4?

64     The issues in relation to the second charge are as follows:

> (a)     Did the accused intend to bite PW4?

> (b)     If so, did the accused take a substantial step towards the biting of PW4?

65     The issues in relation to the first charge will be considered first, before turning to the second charge.

##### (1)   First charge: Did the accused hit PW4 causing PW4 hurt?

66     The first two issues (_ie_, as set out in paragraphs 63(a) and 63(b)) in relation to the first charge will be dealt with together first before the third issue (_ie_, as set out in paragraph 63(c)).

67     The Prosecution primarily relied on the oral evidence of PW3, PW4 and PW5, as well as the CCTV footage which was marked and admitted as P1, in support of its case that the accused hit PW4 several times on PW4’s shoulder, causing her hurt. The Defence relied mainly on the accused’s oral evidence, while also referring to P1, to explain why the accused did not hit PW4.

68     I found the evidence of the relevant prosecution witnesses, PW3, PW4 and PW5, to be internally and externally consistent. PW4 testified that the incident had arisen while the APOs were escorting the accused out of the hospital. In the midst of doing so, the accused raised her mobile phone to make a video recording of the APOs. The APOs then covered the camera of the mobile phone to prevent any recordings from being made. At this point, PW4’s evidence was that the accused became “a bit aggressive”. The accused then used her palm to hit PW4’s left shoulder around three to four times, resulting in “a bit of soreness and redness”. PW4’s testimony was unshaken during cross-examination, where she affirmed that it was her left shoulder that was hit and that she felt the soreness as a result.

69     PW4’s testimony was also corroborated by the evidence of PW3 and PW5. PW3 said that the accused got agitated after the APOs warned her not to take any pictures, and the accused thereafter hit PW4 a few times.[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58) PW3 affirmed unequivocally in cross-examination that he witnessed the accused hit PW4 a few times.[^59] Similarly, PW5 testified that the accused started to get aggressive after they tried to stop the accused from making recordings on her mobile phone. The accused then “punched” PW4.[^60]

70     I further found the oral testimonies of PW3, PW4 and PW5 to be consistent with objective contemporaneous evidence, _ie_ the CCTV footage of the incident at P1. At around the timestamp of 11:04:38 pm, the right arm movement of the accused was observed. While P1 did not clearly show the point of contact between the accused’s palm and PW4’s shoulder, what could clearly be observed was that the accused’s right arm and open palm was raised up and down in a repeated fashion, such action being consistent with the act of hitting down on something with force. At this time, the left side of PW4’s body, including PW4’s shoulder, was seen to be facing the accused. Taken together, I accepted the evidence of PW3, PW4 and PW5 that the accused had hit PW4 on her left shoulder several times. This corroborated PW4’s evidence that soreness and redness had resulted from the accused’s hitting.

71     In contrast, I again found it difficult to accept the accused’s evidence in relation to the first charge. The accused’s attempt to portray herself as a victim who had been bullied by the APOs was both internally inconsistent and externally inconsistent with the objective contemporaneous evidence in P1:

> (a)     In the accused’s examination-in-chief, she insisted that it was the three APOs who were attacking her, and the fact that she swung her hands up and down did not mean she was hitting others. However, she provided no explanation on why she was moving her hands as seen in P1.

> (b)     During cross-examination, Mr Teh played the portion from P1 where the accused was seen to be raising her arms at least three times. Only then did the accused explain that she was pulling her hands backwards, and this was because the APOs had grabbed hold of her hands. However, it was clear to me, from a perusal of P1 from 11:04:38 pm to 11:04:40 pm, that the accused’s actions were not consistent with that of pulling back from another’s grip. If it were a mere pulling back as described by the accused, there would have been no need for the accused’s arms to be raised and lowered repeatedly, and certainly not lowered with some force.

> (c)     The accused said that this arm movement was a “habitual action of movement \[of three\] times”. It was not very clear to me what “habitual” could have meant in this context. In any event, the accused next revised her version again to explain that this was a “natural instinct of \[the\] body” as she was attacked and captured. Therefore, even if the accused were to hit PW4, this was not intentional, and was merely reactional.[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61) This was evidently inconsistent with what the accused had said in the earlier parts of her evidence, _ie_, that she was not hitting others and that she was just pulling her arm back from another’s grip.

72     The accused was also evasive when pressed by Mr Teh on this point. When Mr Teh queried whether the accused’s arms in CCTV footage at P1 were not only raised but also immediately lowered in quick succession, the accused responded that she could not remember, and only knew about it after viewing P1. Mr Teh therefore played the relevant portion of P1 once more. To which, the accused again insisted that it was the APOs who were hitting, capturing and subduing her. The accused then changed the topic again to state that she was molested, and that PW1 had instigated this.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62) Thereafter, she evaded Mr Teh’s questions on multiple instances, either by stating that she did not understand, or simply stating that she refused or did not wish to answer.

73     Having considered the evidence in their totality, I found that the accused did, at around 11.04 pm on 16 May 2020, hit PW4 on her shoulder several times, and this had caused hurt to PW4 in the form of redness and soreness, which was evidence of bodily pain.

##### (2)   First charge: Did the accused intend to cause hurt to PW4?

74     Based on my assessment of the evidence, I found that the accused did hit PW4 on her shoulder several times with the intention of causing hurt to PW4. As explained at paragraphs 68 to 70 above, I accepted the evidence of PW3, PW4 and PW5 in relation to the version of events in relation to the first charge. They testified that the accused was in an agitated and aggressive state after they tried to stop her from making recordings on her mobile phone. The accused was clearly unhappy with the APOs for being in her way.

75     In addition, the accused had hit PW4 on her shoulder several times. I came to the conclusion that the accused must have intended to cause hurt to PW4 in so doing, as it could not have been an accidental one-off act.

##### (3)   Conclusion on the first charge

76     I found that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the first charge, and convicted the accused accordingly.

##### (4)   Second charge: Did the accused intend to bite PW4 and take a substantial step towards this?

77     Owing to the overlap, the two issues at paragraphs 64(a) and 64(b) above will be discussed together in the subsequent paragraphs.

78     As with the first charge, the Prosecution relied substantially on the oral evidence of PW3, PW4 and PW5, and the CCTV footage at P1, in putting forth its case for the second charge, _ie_, that the accused had attempted to bite PW4. The accused refuted this based on her oral evidence and her explanation of P1.

79     I similarly found the evidence of PW3, PW4 and PW5 to be internally and externally consistent in respect of the second charge. PW4 testified that, following from the accused’s hitting of her left shoulder, the APOs let the accused sit down. According to PW4, while the accused was seated, the accused was pulling down her mask and tried to bite PW4. However, the accused failed to do so as PW4 had let go of her hand. PW4 also maintained her testimony throughout cross-examination. The accused had, in cross-examination, put to PW4 that the accused would not have had any “free hand” to pull down her mask as both of her hands were held on to by the APOs. In response, PW4 explained that while she had held on to the accused’s right hand, the accused was still able to pull down her mask as PW4 “did not grab \[the accused\] that hard” and the accused’s hand was also close to her mouth.[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

80     PW4’s oral testimony was consistent with that of PW3 and PW5. PW3 similarly testified that the accused had tried to bite PW4. PW3 stated that the accused had tried to bring her head down to bite PW4, and he saw this as he was standing next to PW4. Further, PW3 could see that the accused had an “open mouth, trying to bite”.[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64) PW3 also said that from his view, the accused’s mask was already lowered when she attempted to bite PW4.[^65] In the same vein, PW5 testified that the accused “tried to bite \[PW4’s\] hand”.[^66]

81     In my judgment, the oral testimonies of PW3, PW4 and PW5 were also consistent with the objective contemporaneous evidence in the CCTV footage at P1. At the timestamp of 11:05:09 pm of P1, the accused was seen to be lunging forward towards PW4 by bringing the accused’s face close to PW4’s arm. While it could not be seen clearly from P1 at this point whether the accused’s mask was covering her mouth, I observed that the accused’s mask was not fully covering her nose and mouth shortly before and after the said timestamp. I accordingly accepted the evidence of PW3, PW4 and PW5 in this regard.

82     As regards the accused’s evidence, I again found this to be internally and externally inconsistent and it was therefore difficult to rely on the same:

> (a)     The accused was inconsistent as regards her version of whether her mask was or was not covering her mouth at the material time. In her examination-in-chief, the accused said that she was wearing her mask and the prosecution witnesses were therefore lying.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67) However, in cross-examination, the accused said that the mask was lowered but she did not use her hand to pull down her mask.[^68] After Mr Teh replayed portions of P1 to the accused, the accused then again changed her position by explaining that her mask was always on but “\[w\]hether it was properly worn, that is another matter.”[^69] In re-examination, the position changed yet again, and the accused explained that she was “screaming out, and because \[she\] opened \[her\] mouth wide, the mask slipped down to below \[her\] nose.”[^70]

> (b)     The accused’s position in examination-in-chief (_ie_, that she was wearing her mask) was also inconsistent with her position during cross-examination of PW3. During her cross-examination of PW3, the accused said that her mask had been lowered when she was seated as she was “getting breathless”.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) In closing submissions, the accused’s position again reverted to that of her mask being “always on”, as could be “seen from the footage at that time”.[^72] The accused’s evidence and position on this point was constantly shifting and there was not a thread of consistency holding her version together.

> (c)     The accused’s evidence was also externally inconsistent with P1. While the accused sought to explain how P1 showed that her mask was always on, I was unable to agree with the same based on my review of P1. From my review of P1, the accused did have her mask pulled down (_ie_, not covering her mouth and nose) at points during the exchange with the APOs, and most crucially, at the moments before and after she lunged forward towards PW4. This was observed at P1 from the timestamp of 11:05:09 pm to 11:06:02 pm.

> (d)     The accused also focused a large part of her evidence on how the APOs had attacked her and held on to her with great strength. In support of this, the accused tendered D9, a photograph of her wrist, to show that her wrist was “red and swollen” and that her “vein stood out”.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) The accused alleged that this photograph was taken on 16 May 2020, and that the original photograph was in her phone with the date. There was however no evidence of this before the court. There was also no date indicated on D9. In any event, even if I were to take the accused’s word that the photograph was taken on 16 May 2020 itself, I did not think it was manifestly clear from D9 that the wrist (assuming it was the accused’s wrist) was red and swollen.

> (e)     In her examination-in-chief, the accused never purported to give any explanation for her lunging forward towards PW4. The accused stated that she was pressed down on the chair and unable to move at all during that time. It was only during cross-examination, when Mr Teh played the portion of P1 showing the accused lunging forward, that the accused sought to explain this. The accused said that as the APOs had grabbed hold of both her hands, she could only use her head to hit PW4’s arm. On the accused’s own version, it would appear that she had an intention to inflict hurt on PW4 in any event.

> (f)     Shortly thereafter, the accused’s version again shifted, and she then stated that she “lowered \[her\] gravity to protect \[herself\]”, which was her “natural instinct” in that one minute.[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74) The accused again gave a wholly confusing account to explain her lunging action, by stating that both of her legs were “lifted up” and her “point of gravity \[was\] towards the back”.[^75] I considered this to be an evasive response.

##### (5)   Conclusion on the second charge

83     All considered, I found that the accused did, at around 11.05 pm on 16 May 2020, intend to bite PW4. The accused had also taken a substantial step towards the biting of PW4 by lowering her mask and lunging towards PW4 by bringing the accused’s face close to PW4’s arm.

84     I found that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the second charge, and convicted the accused accordingly.

#### Allegation of collusion raised by the accused

85     For completeness, I also considered the allegation of collusion between the Prosecution’s witnesses, as raised by the accused.

86     The accused had, at various points during the trial, alluded that the Prosecution’s witnesses had colluded and lied to falsely implicated the accused. It is trite that until the Defence has shown that the victim has a motive to falsely implicate the accused, the burden does not fall on the Prosecution to disprove that motive. In this case, I found that the accused has not discharged this burden to show that any of the Prosecution’s witnesses had any motive to falsely implicate her, and her allegations in this regard were baseless and inconsistent.

87     The accused initially alleged in her examination-in-chief that she believed that PW1 had been working at CGH for a long time, and that there was a “close connection” between PW5 and PW1.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) The accused had however not put this to PW1 in cross-examination, whether at the first instance or when PW1 was recalled further to the Prosecution’s application to amend the fourth charge. As regards PW5, the accused asked PW5 in cross-examination how long he had known PW1 for. PW5 replied that he did not know PW1 prior to the incident.

88     The accused again alleged this when she was cross-examined by Mr Teh. The accused said that there was “someone \[who was\] behind this asking them to do this and that person \[was\] PW1”.[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77) However, when asked directly by Mr Teh on this “close connection” between PW1 and PW5, the accused appeared to have retracted this allegation and responded that “\[y\]ou cannot say that”.[^78] This therefore seemed to me to be a baseless allegation, and the accused has failed to provide any basis for the same.

89     As for PW6, the accused thought that PW6 was very familiar with the hospital and the people there. The accused’s basis for this belief appeared to stem from the fact that PW6 “kept going out” to talk and interact with the doctors and nurses when PW6 was taking the accused’s statement. The accused also said that PW6 kept telling her to “reduce big matter to small and small matters to not \[_sic_\], and told her not to proceed” with her claim of molest.[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79) This was denied by PW6 in cross-examination. It also appeared to be the accused’s case that PW6 informed her that if she were to proceed with the molest case, he would sue her, and it would be disadvantageous to her. This was similarly denied by PW6.[^80]

90     In addition, the accused said that PW6 had informed her that he would be settling her bill with the hospital and that she would not need to pay. This was denied by PW6 in cross-examination. The accused tendered D4 in support of this account. On its face, D4 is a tax invoice from CGH billed to the accused herself for “A&E attendance fee”. I was unable to see how D4 would be sufficient evidence of the accused’s allegation that PW6 would settle her bill with the hospital, especially since the bill was addressed to the accused. There was simply no reason for PW6 to have made such an offer.

91     The accused herself admitted during cross-examination that she did not know any of the Prosecution’s witnesses (_ie_, PW1 to PW6) prior to the material date on 16 May 2020.[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81) The accused also said that she did not know if the Prosecution’s witnesses would have any reason to falsely implicate her. The accused was unable to point to any reason why the Prosecution’s witnesses would have the motive to lie against her, save to insist that they were lying.[^82] The accused’s position appeared to be that the Prosecution’s witnesses were not telling the truth as they were just “testifying against \[her\] based on the footage of that 45 seconds recording” (_ie_, P1).[^83]

92     To this end, I was satisfied that the material witnesses for the first charge and second charge (_ie_, PW3, PW4 and PW5) had given their oral evidence on the day’s incidents **_before_** the CCTV footage at P1 was played to them in court. They had testified from memory first, without any aid or interference from P1. Their respective oral accounts were consistent with each other and with P1. In any event, the accused had similarly relied heavily on the P1 and provided her own explanations on how P1 ought to be viewed. For example, the accused provided multiple screenshots from P1 in her mitigation plea and “implore\[d\] the judge to watch the video … carefully”, where, on her account, she did not hit anyone.

93     Having carefully assessed the evidence before the court, I found the accused’s allegation of there being some form of collusion and false implication on the part of the Prosecution’s witnesses to be wholly devoid of merit. The accused had simply made bare assertions to this effect and was unable to discharge her burden of proof.

### Sentencing

#### Antecedents

94     The accused is a first-time offender.

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

95     The Prosecution submitted that the following sentences were appropriate: a short custodial term for the first charge and second charge, and a fine ranging between $3,000 to $5,000 each for the third charge and fourth charge. While the Prosecution did not initially indicate a position on how the short custodial term for the first charge and second charge were to run, Mr Teh subsequently clarified in oral submissions that the Prosecution has no objections to them being run concurrently given that they were of a similar nature being committed within a short span of time and involved the same victim.[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84)

96     For the first charge and second charge, the Prosecution relied on _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”), which set out a two-step sentencing framework for a first-time offender who pleads guilty to an offence under s 323 of the PC. The Prosecution submitted that both the first charge and the second charge fell under Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework, which attracted an indicative sentencing range of fines or a short custodial term of up to four weeks.

97     The Prosecution’s position was that a short custodial sentence was appropriate for the first charge and second charge for the following reasons: (a) the accused had claimed trial despite clear evidence of her offending behaviour; (b) the injuries were nevertheless minor for the first charge and the victim (_ie_, PW4) did not seek any medical treatment for them; (c) the victim (_ie_, PW4) did not sustain any injury from the accused’s attempt to bite in the second charge; (d) the accused’s actions were not premeditated; and (e) the altercation was brief and only lasted for a few seconds.

98     As regards the third charge and fourth charge, the Prosecution referred to _Tan Yao Min v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1134</span>, where it was noted in the context of offences under s 3 of the POHA that courts have imposed fines ranging from $1,500 to $2,500 where the communication is less aggravated. Here, the third charge and fourth charge were for offences under s 6 of the POHA. Further, the accused had claimed trial to them. The Prosecution thus submitted that a fine of $3,000 to $5,000 each would be appropriate bearing in mind the relatively minor communication involved.

#### Mitigation

99     The accused filed a written mitigation plea, which dealt largely with issues relating to the finding of guilt rather than sentence. This was written in a mix of English and Chinese, and the accused elected to read out the portions in Chinese, for it to be interpreted in English through the interpreter.

100    The accused maintained that she did not do the acts as stated in all four charges. Nonetheless, the accused pleaded for leniency and asked that the court give a verbal or written warning. The accused also said that she was willing to apologise if found guilty.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85)

101    The accused also raised a list of her medical conditions in her mitigation, which are summarised as follows: (a) inflammation of thyroid glands for over 30 years for which an operation was scheduled on 11 January 2022; (b) asthma for over 30 years; (c) depression for six years; (d) allergic skin disease for 20 years; (e) vitiligo for 10 years; (f) immune system disorder for about 10 years, which resulted in loss of hair; (g) loss of smell and taste for 10 years; and (h) pre-gastric cancer diagnosed in 2018. The only documents tendered by the accused in support of the above were: (a) a referral note from Bedok Polyclinic to the psychological medicine department in CGH (for a visit on 13 November 2021); (b) a consult note from CGH postponing a surgery to 11 January 2022; and (c) an admission authorisation form from CGH ordered on 8 October 2021 stating an admission date of 11 January 2022 for total thyroidectomy.

#### Decision on sentence

102    Across all four charges, I took into consideration the fact that the accused was a first-time offender. However, the fact that she has claimed trial and not pleaded guilty was indicative of her lack of remorse and she would not be afforded any sentencing discount associated with a genuine show of remorse.

103    As regards the accused’s request for a verbal or written warning, I did not consider this to be a sentencing option available to the court. Accordingly, I did not consider this option in coming to my decision on sentence.

##### (1)   First charge and second charge

104    Under s 323 of the PC, any person who voluntarily causes hurt shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both. Under s 512(2) of the PC, any person who attempts to commit an offence punishable by the PC shall be punished with such punishment as is prescribed for that offence.

105    I agreed with the Prosecution that the first charge and second charge, both of low harm, placed within Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework. I also agreed with the Prosecution that the custodial threshold has been crossed in respect of the first charge and the second charge. The victim in both these charges (_ie_, PW4) was an auxiliary police officer who was activated to the scene further to a call for assistance at the admissions counter, due to a commotion that had arisen from the accused’s actions. The victim and her colleagues (_ie_, the APOs) proceeded to escort the accused out when the accused took out her mobile phone midway and pointed it towards the APOs. The APOs tried to prevent the accused from making any recordings, and what ensued was the accused hitting the victim on the shoulder several times and then attempting to bite the victim.

106    I considered that it would be in the public’s interest for a deterrent custodial sentence to be imposed here. There exists a need to protect auxiliary police officers who are discharging their duties, to ensure that they are able to work in a safe environment free from abuse. As was observed in _Public Prosecutor v Mah Kiat Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 4</span> (“_Mah Kiat Seng_”) in the context of an offence under s 323 of the PC, it “would normally be an aggravating factor that the assault was made against a person of authority” (at \[67\]). The victim in _Mah Kiat Seng_ was a campus security officer. In the present case, I found it similarly aggravating that the assault and attempted assault were made against an auxiliary police officer, as a person of authority. While the court in _Mah Kiat Seng_ sentenced the offender to the maximum fine of $5,000, the court explained that this was due to the exceptional facts of that case, including the peculiar character traits of the offender (at \[67\]-\[70\]).[^86] I did not think that there were such exceptional facts here, and I found that the custodial threshold has been crossed.

107    Nonetheless, as highlighted by the Prosecution, the injuries caused in the first charge were minor and no injuries resulted from the attempt in the second charge. I also agreed with Prosecution’s submissions that the accused’s actions were not premediated, and the altercation was brief.

108    Having considered the circumstances in their totality, I imposed sentence of one week’s imprisonment each for the first charge and second charge, to be run concurrently. I was of the view that this was proportionate to reflect the criminality presented.

109    In coming to this sentence, I bore in mind the list of medical conditions raised by the accused (at paragraph 101 above) alongside the observations of the High Court in _Chew Soo Chun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 78</span> on the relevance of ill health to sentencing (at \[38\]-\[39\]):

> 38    In summary, ill health is relevant to sentencing in two ways. _First, it is a ground for the exercise of judicial mercy._ Judicial mercy is an exceptional recourse available for truly exceptional cases and which will result in an exceptional sentence. Where mercy is exercised, the court is compelled by humanitarian considerations arising from the exceptional circumstances to order the minimum imprisonment term or a non-custodial sentence where appropriate. _Secondly, it exists as a mitigating factor._ The cases where ill health will be regarded as a mitigating factor include those which do not fall within the realm of the exceptional but _involve markedly disproportionate impact of an imprisonment term on an offender by reason of his ill health_. The court takes into account the fact that ill health may render an imprisonment term that will not otherwise be crushing to one offender but may be so to another, and attenuates the sentences accordingly for the latter offender so that it will not be disproportionate to his culpability and physical condition.

> 39     _In all other cases, ill health is irrelevant to sentencing. It may be that the offender has a condition or several conditions, but unless he can satisfy the tests for exercising judicial mercy or for mitigating a sentence because of disproportionate suffering or decreased culpability, there is no proper basis to vary the sentence. Hence, it will be insufficient for an offender to merely show that he is ill_…

> \[Emphasis added in italics\]

110    In the present case, based on the documents and submissions of the accused before the court, I was not of the view that the accused has satisfied the tests for exercising judicial mercy or for mitigating a sentence because of disproportionate suffering or decreased culpability. I did not find there to be proper basis to vary the sentence of one week’s imprisonment each for the first and second charge (to run concurrently).

##### (2)   Third charge and fourth charge

111    Under s 6(3) of the POHA, an individual convicted for an offence under s 6(1) of the POHA shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

112    Public service workers must be protected against such insulting words in their execution of duty. In this case, PW1 was discharging her duties as a medical doctor and exercising her professional opinion in recommending that the accused undergo various tests to aid in diagnosis. The accused was entitled to her own views and disagree with PW1. However, to direct insulting words towards PW1 in so disagreeing was wholly unnecessary and inappropriate. Further, the fourth charge had taken place at the admissions counter, in the presence of other hospital staff and members of the public.

113    That said, I agreed with the Prosecution that the custodial threshold has not been crossed in respect of the third charge and fourth charge and a fine would be appropriate. I considered that the two sets of words said by the accused, namely “stupid” and “shen jing bing” (_ie_, meaning “crazy”), could be regarded as being on the less aggravating end of the spectrum of insulting words.

114    All considered, I found that a fine of $2,500 each (in default thereof, four days’ imprisonment each) for the third charge and fourth charge was appropriate in the circumstances. As regards the default sentence to be imposed, the accused indicated during sentencing that it would be “impossible for \[her\] to pay” on that day.[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87) I have thus taken that into account and calibrated the default sentence for each charge accordingly to ensure that the total term of imprisonment to be served by the accused would not be crushing.

## Conclusion

115    In summary, I found the accused guilty of all four charges and sentenced her to a total sentence of one week’s imprisonment and fine of $5,000 (in default thereof, eight days’ imprisonment).
