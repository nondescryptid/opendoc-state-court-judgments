Credit and Security – Performance bond – Unconscionability

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/RAS 23/2021.\]

27 December 2021

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       The applicant is a building contractor. The first respondent is the owner of a detached house at Branksome Road. The second respondent had issued a performance bond (“the Bond”) in favour of the first respondent as required under the terms of a building contract entered into between the applicant and the first respondent on or around 1 June 2018.

2       The first respondent made a demand on the Bond in July 2021. In this originating summons (“OS”), the applicant sought _inter alia_ a declaration that the first respondent’s demand on the Bond was unconscionable together with an injunction to restrain the second respondent from making any payment, and the first respondent from receiving any monies, under the Bond.

3       After due consideration of the evidence and submissions, I had dismissed the OS and ordered costs on an indemnity basis in favour of the first respondent. The applicant being dissatisfied with the outcome of the hearing has appealed to the High Court. My reasons for dismissing the OS are set out herein.

## Background

## The Contract

4       Pursuant to a letter of acceptance dated 1 June 2018, the applicant had been appointed as the contractor to carry out various additions and alterations to the house (“the Project”) for the original contract sum of $2,296,386.98[^1].

5       The parties agree that the building contract (“the Contract”) is in the standard form incorporating the Singapore Institute of Architects’ Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (2017) (1st Edition) (“the SIA Form and/or SIA Conditions”)[^2]. Under the SIA Form, the first respondent is the Employer while the applicant is the Contractor. The named architect for the Project is SH Lim Architects Pte Ltd (“the Architect”) of which one Tan Suat Hua _aka_ Mrs Lim Suat Hua (“LSH”) is the managing director as well as one of the shareholders.

6       The Project was personal to LSH – she had designed the house as the architect for her own family’s occupation. At the outset of the project, LSH had declared her interest as the sole shareholder of the first respondent, as well as the “qualified person” appointed for the Project for the purposes of the Building Control Act (Cap 29). The Declaration of Interest dated 1 June 2018[^3] had been accepted and signed by the applicant’s director, Ng Shi Yong (“NSY”).

### The Performance Bond and the interim injunction

7       The Bond was furnished pursuant to paragraph 2.3.7 of the letter of acceptance dated 1 June 2018 for a sum equal to 10% of the contract sum and addressed to the first respondent as the Employer. The validity of the Bond had been extended repeatedly and as at the commencement of this action, the extension was valid for the period “31 August 2020 plus 12 months’ Maintenance Period.”[^4]

8       It is not disputed that the Bond is an on-demand bond as can be seen from the provisions of the Bond extracted below[^5]:

> Now in consideration of Employer not insisting on the Contractor paying the sum of Singapore Dollars Two Hundred Twenty Nine Thousand, Six Hundred and Thirty Eight and Cents Seventy Only (S$229,638.70) under the Contract as a security deposit for the Contract, we Great Eastern General Insurance Limited (at the request of the Contractor) hereby agree as follows:

>> 1.    We hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertake, covenant and firmly bind ourselves to pay to you on demand any sum or sums which from time to time may be demanded by you up to a maximum sum of Singapore Dollars Two Hundred Twenty Nine Thousand, Six Hundred and Thirty Eight and Cents Seventy Only (S$229,638.70) (“the Guaranteed Sum”) upon receiving your written notice of claim for payment made in the manner as set out in Clause 2 herein.

>> 2.    Upon your demand of the whole or any part of the Guaranteed Sum made in writing addressed to us and sent by hand or by AR registered post to 1 Pickering Street, #01-01 Great Eastern Centre, Singapore 048659 or at such other address as may be notified by us in writing to you, and made at any time on or before the expiry of 90 days after the Termination Date of this Bond, we shall immediately pay the sum demanded to you notwithstanding the existence of any dispute or differences which may have arisen in relation to the Contract or any amount payable under the Contract or any defences which the Contractor may have, or any request or instruction which may have been given to us by the Contractor not to pay the same.

>> 3.    We shall not be obliged to inquire into the reasons, grounds or circumstances of any demand made by you nor into the respective rights, obligations and/or liabilities between you and the Contractor under the Contract, or into the authenticity of your notice or the authority of persons signing such notice but shall immediately pay to you the Guaranteed Sum (or any part as stated in your demand) on your written demand made in the manner as set out in Clause 2 herein.

9       As such, the second respondent was obliged to pay the sum demanded under the Bond immediately upon the first respondent’s demand.

10     The first respondent sent its written demand for the full sum of the Bond by hand to the second respondent on 15 July 2021 demanding for payment to be made no later than 12 pm on 22 July 2021[^6].

11     Upon being notified of the demand, the applicant had filed the present action and obtained an interim injunction on an urgent _ex parte_ application to restrain the payment on the Bond pending the hearing of the OS. Based on the evidence adduced at the hearing of the contested _ex parte_ application, I had granted the interim injunction upon the applicant’s undertaking as to damages.

### Events prior to the demand on the Bond

12     Although the original contract period was stated as 12 months from the contract commencement date of 28 June 2018, it is undisputed that the completion of the works had been delayed substantially beyond the original contracted completion date of 27 June 2019. The Completion Certificate for the Project issued by the Architect on 24 March 2021 certified 31 August 2020 as the completion date of the works under the contract. Consequently, the 12 months maintenance period defined in the Contract was to commence on 1 September 2020 and expire on 31 August 2021 as agreed between the parties[^7].

13     While LSH and her family had moved into the house from around September 2020, there were various items of outstanding works and defects that were notified to the applicant by way of emails dated from 1 September 2020[^8]. As the outstanding works and defects had not been attended to or rectified by the applicant according to the Employer’s requirements, the Architect had issued six sets of Architect’s Directions pursuant to Clause 1(1) of the SIA Conditions[^9].

14     A joint site inspection was arranged on 15 April 2021 which was attended by representatives of the applicant as well as the first respondent and the Architect. Further Architect’s Directions were issued to the applicant following the joint inspection which also notified the applicant to complete the rectification works before the expiry of the maintenance period on 31 August 2021. On 31 May 2021, the Architect gave a final deadline to 14 June 2021 for the applicant to carry out the rectifications and/or submit its proposal for rectification[^10]. It appears from the photographs exhibited in LSH’s affidavit that as at 28 June 2021, the majority of the defects identified at the joint inspection of 15 April 2021 had not been rectified.

15     From the averments made in the affidavits of NSY[^11] and LSH, it is clear that there is a dispute between the parties as to the scope of uncompleted works and the defects requiring rectification. The chain of correspondence exhibited in LSH’s affidavit also shows that it was only in February 2021 after the issuance of the Architect’s Directions to rectify defects that the applicant made the allegation on the Architect’s conflict of interest[^12].

16     In regard to the delay in the Project, the applicant had on 22 April 2019 submitted an application to the Architect for extension of time (“EOT”) of 122 days pursuant to Clause 23 of the SIA Conditions[^13] on three grounds, _viz_ (1) delay in the issuance of the permit to commence structural works from the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”), (2) delay caused by additional strengthening structural works, and (3) delay in the approval of the shop drawings of the roof structural steelworks and changes in design.

17     The Architect had responded on 14 May 2019 rejecting the first ground of the EOT application stating that the permit to commence structural works on 27 August 2019 did not cause any delay to the progress of the works. As for the second and third grounds for the EOT application, the Architect replied to state that these grounds could not be evaluated unless further information was provided to show how these items were in the Project’s critical path and had affected the sequence and progress of the works. The applicant failed to respond with the requested information. On 30 March 2021, the Architect had given notice[^14] to the applicant that based on the actual completion date of 31 August 2020 certified in the Completion Certificate, after deducting 122 days of relief under Part A of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, there was a total of 309 days of delay. This would entitle the Employer to recover liquidated damages of $154,500 (based on $500 per calendar day of delay) pursuant to the Contract.

18     The applicant disputed the validity of the notice of delay[^15] and asserted in its reply dated 20 April 2021 that the Architect had not acted independently due to her conflict of interest as both owner and Architect for the Project. On 27 April 2021[^16], the Architect responded to ask the applicant to explain its reasons to dispute the notice of delay and to substantiate its claim with the necessary documents. The applicant did not respond with any further application for EOT or provide any information or documents. As such, the applicant would be deemed to have accepted that it was in culpable delay. The applicant had also been notified that the Delay Certificate would be issued at any time on or before the Final Certificate under the SIA Conditions[^17].

### Payment Claim 24

19     On 28 April 2021 against the backdrop of the events outlined above, the applicant submitted a progress payment claim for the sum of $389,203.15 (inclusive of GST). This was progress payment claim number 24 (“PC 24”).

20     In response to PC 24, the Architect had certified that only the sum of $1,980.60 was due for payment under Interim Certificate 24 (“IC 24”) issued on 10 May 2021. The Architect’s certification translated to a difference of $387,222.55 (inclusive of GST) as the amount disputed between the parties.

21     Notably, the first respondent did not provide a payment response under s 11 of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B) (“SOPA”) within the timelines given in the SIA Conditions. Based on the SOPA regime, the applicant was entitled to lodge an adjudication application between 28 May and 3 June 2021.

### SOPA adjudication

22     On 3 June 2021, the applicant through its solicitors served a notice of intention to apply for adjudication on the first respondent and lodged the adjudication application on the same day. The Singapore Mediation Centre as the authorised nominating body under SOPA appointed the adjudicator on 7 June 2021. All directions given by the adjudicator were complied with.

23     On 25 June 2021, the adjudicator issued her adjudication determination (“AD”) in which it was determined that the first respondent was to pay the applicant the adjudicated amount of $210,120.34 (inclusive of GST). This was subsequently amended on 28 June 2021 to $335,783.82 (inclusive of GST) to include the item on ACMV works in the sum of $117,442.50 on the basis of a clerical mistake or an error arising from an accidental slip or omission pointed out by the applicant’s solicitors.

24     Payment of the adjudicated amount was to be made within 35 days after the applicant served its tax invoice on the first respondent. As the applicant had served its tax invoice on 29 June 2021, the due date for payment fell on 3 August 2021. It is not disputed that all payments required under the AD, including the adjudicator’s costs, have been paid by the first respondent.

### Delay Certificate, Architect’s Revised IC 24a and Demand on the Bond

25     On 14 July 2021, the Architect issued the Delay Certificate pursuant to Clause 24 of the SIA Conditions[^18]. This was sent to the appellant by the first respondent’s solicitors on 15 July 2021 together with their letter notifying the applicant of the first respondent’s intention to impose liquidated damages of $154,500 for the 309 days of delay and to claim costs of rectification of defects assessed at $167,690[^19].

26     The Architect’s Interim Certificate 24a (Revised) (“IC 24a”) which took into account the adjudicated sum and the deductions for the liquidated damages and outstanding defects rectification works dated 15 July 2021 was also sent to the applicant on the same day[^20]. On the same day, the first respondent made the demand for payment on the Bond[^21].

## Issue – whether demand on the Bond was unconscionable

27     The sole issue that the court had to determine was whether the first respondent’s demand on the Bond was unconscionable. From the arguments canvassed by the parties, the following sub-issues touching on aspects of unconscionability had also to be addressed:

> (a)     whether the call on the Bond was to undo the effect of the SOPA adjudication determination,

> (b)     whether the Architect’s certifications of delay and defects were in conflict of interest, and

> (c)     whether the call on the Bond was for an excessive sum.

### Applicable law

28     It is well settled that an applicant seeking to prevent the call on an on-demand performance bond has a high threshold to cross. The test to apply in the exercise of the court’s discretion and the rationale for imposing a barrier of such a high level in applications of this nature has been clearly explained by the Court of Appeal in _BS Mount Sophia Pte Ltd v Join-Aim Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 352</span> (“_BS Mount Sophia_”) at \[20\] to \[25\], as extracted below:

> _The high threshold for establishing unconscionability_

> 20    Of greater significance in the context of the present appeal is the necessary threshold of unconscionability that has to be established before the court will exercise its discretion to grant an injunction. Indeed, as we shall see, it is precisely this threshold that constitutes the key to resolving the relevant tension that exists, which tension we will address in a moment…. It is important to note, at the outset, that the law in this regard is settled. Simply put, the threshold is a high one, and the burden that the applicant has to discharge is to demonstrate a strong _prima fac_ie case of unconscionability…

> 21    When determining if a strong _prima facie_ case has been made out, the entire context of the case must be thoroughly considered, and it is **_only if the entire context of the case is particularly malodorous that such an injunction should be granted_**. We must emphasise that **_the courts’ discretion to grant such injunctions must be sparingly exercised_** and it should not be an easy thing for an applicant to establish a strong _prima facie_ case.

> 22    The **_reason for setting the barrier at such a high level_** is that the equitable remedy of the interim prohibitive injunction is a very harsh one. It restricts the person in whose favour the performance bond was issued (“the **_beneficiary_**”) from doing that which he was entitled by agreement of the parties to do, and which he in all probability had bargained for during the negotiations leading up to the contract concerned. In essence, he **_would be prevented from enforcing a substantive right which he had contracted for_**.

> 23    …

> … Unconscionability is a distinct and separate ground from fraud, and … includes conduct such as unfairness and abuse that are broader than the conduct that would constitute fraud. In other words, the availability of unconscionability acknowledges that **_conduct exhibited by the beneficiary_** other than fraud might be **_sufficiently reprehensible to justify relief_** on the part of the obligor...

> 24    Hence, the availability of unconscionability as a ground for relief does not necessarily mean that it would be easier for an obligor of a performance bond to obtain injunctive relief from an oppressive call on the bond by a beneficiary. As mentioned earlier, the high threshold for unconscionability is established law and in this appeal we are merely reinforcing this and explaining why this is so. The reasons for requiring a high threshold for unconscionability relate to the need to strike the appropriate balance between the conflicting positions of the obligor and beneficiary of a performance bond, which we have termed the “perennial tension”. Tied up in this balance is the underlying need to preserve the _raison d’être_ of performance bonds – that they are to provide security for the performance of the obligor’s obligations – which stems from broader policy reasons. **_If calls on this security by the beneficiary are too liberally subject to injunctive relief from the courts, this security loses its efficacy_** and the _raison d’être_ of performance bonds would be eroded or even wholly undermined.

> 25 Furthermore, the **_courts should be slow to upset the status quo_** and disrupt the allocation of risk which the parties had decided upon for themselves in a building contract (see, eg, the decisions of this court in _Anwar Siraj_ v _Teo Hee Lai Building Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 394</span> at \[16\] and _Eltraco International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 198</span> (“_Eltraco_”) at \[30\]). The bid price or other terms of the contract would in all probability have been influenced by the mode of provision of security, _viz_, a performance bond as opposed to a cash deposit. As with all contracts, **_the parties should abide by the bargain that they have struck_**.

(emphasis in bold italics mine)

29     In the present case, the applicant had relied primarily on the Court of Appeal decision of _Samsung C&T Corp v Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 955</span> (“_Samsung C&T Corp_”) to argue its case of unconscionability.

30     The facts of _Samsung C&T Corp_ are as follows[^22]:

> (i)     The Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) had engaged Samsung C&T Corporation (“Samsung”) as the main contractor for one of its projects (“the Project”). Samsung engaged Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd (“SLH”) to be its subcontractor to carry out excavation works for the Project. Under the subcontract between SLH and Samsung (“the Subcontract”), SLH was to excavate various types of material. Pursuant to the Subcontract, SLH procured a performance bond (“PB”) by a bank in favour of Samsung.

> (ii)     On 31 August 2018, SLH served Payment Claim Number 20 on Samsung for $3,278,935.95. Samsung issued its payment response, stating that Samsung should pay SLH $167,848.99 only. The matter proceeded to adjudication and the adjudicator determined that Samsung was to pay $2,473,295.20 to SLH.

> (iii)     Subsequently, Samsung claimed that it had noticed from an e-mail from SLH to LTA that SLH was saying that it had disposed of 226,875,130kg of material as of 16 December 2018 and that the remaining loads would be disposed of based on a weight of 16,000kg per lorry. Based on those figures, Samsung then applied a formula to determine the volume of material removed per lorry and asserted that the actual volume of material removed was less than what SLH had previously claimed.

> (iv)     On 31 January 2019, SLH submitted Payment Claim Number 25. On 6 March 2019, Samsung issued a further notice of dispute, claiming overpayment and demanding repayment within seven days, failing which it would take all steps necessary to recover the sum.

> (v)     The matter was again referred to adjudication. While that adjudication was ongoing, Samsung made a demand for the full bond amount of $826,713.53 on the basis that SLH had, in breach of the Subcontract, over-claimed in relation to works purportedly performed under that contract.

> (vi)     SLH applied for an injunction to restrain Samsung from receiving any money under the PB on the basis that its call was unconscionable which was granted by the High Court.

31     In dismissing the appeal from Samsung, the Court of Appeal in _Samsung C&T Corp_ held that it was unconscionable for a party to make a demand on a performance bond in circumstances where the effect of so doing would be to negate an adjudication determination prior to any final determination of the dispute between the parties because of the legislative scheme embodied in SOPA.

### Whether the call on the Bond was to undo the effect of the SOPA adjudication determination

32     The applicant sought to draw an analogy of its case to that of _Samsung C&T Corp_ – it argued that the first respondent’s call on the Bond purportedly in exercise of its contractual rights and premised on its claim for liquidated damages for delay and alleged defects rectification costs as the basis of the call on the Bond was effectively to negate the effect of the AD. The applicant relied on the Court of Appeal dicta in _Samsung C&T Corp_ to emphasise that the first respondent’s right to exercise its contractual rights had been circumscribed by ss 21 and 36 of SOPA. S 21 of SOPA provides for the binding effect and temporary finality of an AD while s 36 prohibits contracting out of SOPA.

33     However, in applying the holding in _Samsung C&T Corp_, it is crucial to bear in mind that the subcontractor, SLH, did not rely merely on the existence of an AD but that Samsung’s reasons for making the demand on the PB had already been considered and rejected by the adjudicator. It was in fact agreed that the nub of Samsung’s complaint about overpayment, which was the premise of its demand on the PB, concerned matters that had already been adjudicated under the first AD[^23].

34     Hence, the Court of Appeal had, after analysing various Australian decisions relied on by Samsung touching on their equivalent legislation to SOPA, opined at \[58\] that:

> …. While Samsung is entitled to disagree with and challenge the views of the adjudicator, it is entitled to do so only in final dispute resolution proceedings between the parties, whether before a court or tribunal or otherwise. The contractual rights of parties are circumscribed by SOPA and the scheme under SOPA and not the other way around. Otherwise the “no contracting out” provision in s 36 SOPA would be meaningless. We did not agree that, on the one hand, Samsung must pay the adjudicated amount but, on the other hand, it can recover overpayment by making a demand on the PB and **_rely on reasons which have been rejected by the adjudicator to resist a restraining order_**. If it could do so, the temporary finality of the AD would be undermined.

(emphasis in bold italics mine)

35     The inquiry as to unconscionability in each case is a fact-sensitive one. As emphatically expressed by the Court of Appeal in _BS Mount Sophia_, the entire context of a case has to be considered, and only if the conduct of the beneficiary is so reprehensible and malodorous that an injunction would be granted to prevent the beneficiary from enforcing a substantive right that he had contracted for.

36     A perusal of the AD issued by the adjudicator shows that matters pertaining to the first respondent’s claim for delay and defects had not been (and could not have been) canvassed before her due to the absence of a payment response as mandated under the SOPA scheme. The applicant sought to argue that these matters could, and should, have been raised at the SOPA adjudication but the first respondent had elected not to, for reasons best known to itself.

37     From the full record of the correspondence exhibited in the affidavits of NSY and LSH, it cannot be said that there was any deliberate intention on the part of the Architect and/or the first respondent to avoid making the claims for delay and defects in the adjudication proceedings.

38     At the time when PC 24 was submitted, the applicant had repeatedly failed to address the issue of defects raised in the first respondent’s emails and Architect’s directions. The ultimatum issued on 31 May 2021 giving a final deadline on 14 June 2021 had overlapped the timelines for the applicant to lodge its adjudication application. At no time did the applicant inform the first respondent of its intention to make a SOPA application until the last day of the dispute settlement period on 3 June 2021 which it proceeded to do on that same day. While the applicant had acted within its rights under SOPA, the sequence of events as documented gives some credence to the first respondent’s characterisation of the applicant’s action as an “ambush” application[^24]. The SOPA proceedings thus dealt only with the valuation of the works performed under the Contract.

39     As the applicant had been given until the 14 June 2021 deadline to respond on the defects rectification, it was not within the contemplation of the Architect to address this issue in its initial certificate, IC24. Accordingly, it is hardly surprising that the first respondent did not provide a payment response to PC24.

40     Further, the third party delay analysis report and report on the building defects were only completed in July 2021. The findings in these reports were relied on by the Architect to issue its revised certificate IC24a. It was only upon the issuance of IC24a that the first respondent could take steps to seek recovery of sums due to it under the Contract and have recourse to the Bond.

41     As to the contrasting positions on the delay analyses as well as the differences in valuation of the defects rectification works put up by both sides, it was not required of the court in its inquiry on unconscionability to engage into a protracted consideration of the merits or go into the minutiae of the case (see _BS Mount Sophia_ at \[40\] and \[45\]). Nonetheless, I would observe that the two reports furnished by the first respondent had served to bolster its case that it had not acted _mala fide_ in making the call on the Bond.

42     Considering the demand on the Bond in the context of the full chronology of events, there was no basis for the court to find any “collateral purpose” as alleged by the applicant. It could not be inferred that the first respondent’s call on the Bond on 15 July 2021 was made to undo or negate the effect of the AD. Hence, the declaration of unconscionability sought in prayer 1 of the OS had to be dismissed.

### Whether the Architect’s certifications of delay and defects were in conflict of interest

43     To support its case of unconscionability, the applicant had canvassed the argument that because of the dual role of LSH in the Project, there was the issue of whether as the Architect, she had acted independently. Despite the Declaration of Interest which its director, NSY, had acknowledged before the Project commenced, the applicant submitted that there had been no express agreement on its part to waive any conflict of interest.

44     In my view, the applicant’s submission on this point has no merit. There is no basis to disbelieve LSH’s statement that she had declared to all tenderers her personal involvement in the Project[^25] in view of the signed Declaration of Interest which had been duly acknowledged and accepted by NSY. Notably, throughout the progress of the works, the allegation of the Architect being in a position of conflict had not been raised at any time, even when the applicant’s EOT application in April 2019 had been rejected by the Architect in May 2019. As earlier noted, the conflict allegation only surfaced in February 2021 after the applicant had refused to comply with the Architect’s directions.

45     In any case, the Architect’s certification in IC24a is amply supported by the delay analysis report from ACX Contract Services Pte Ltd as well as the defects survey report from Building Appraisal Pte Ltd. Both the experts who put up these reports had filed affidavits attesting to the instructions received and _prima facie_ would have to be considered as independent third parties. The relative merits of their assessments and opinions can only be tested at the appropriate forum.

46     There is accordingly no basis on the applicant’s part to allege unconscionability on the ground of conflict of interest.

### Whether the call on the Bond was for an excessive sum

47     On this issue, the applicant’s case was that based on the Architect’s revised interim certificate IC24a, the contract sum had been reduced to $1,544,433.51, which was lower than the sum of $2,296,386.98 in the original Contract[^26]. As such, the first respondent’s call on the Bond for the sum of $229,638.70 was excessive by reference to the contract price. It was submitted that a call on a performance bond for an excessive sum would be unconscionable on the authority of _GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack Building Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] SGCA 60</span> (“_GHL”_).

48     In my view, the facts in _GHL_ can be distinguished as the contract sum there had been revised drastically downwards by a very substantial 65% from $5,781,400 to $1,961,400. This was due to the exclusion of various subcontract works for which separate contracts and performance bonds had been procured from subcontractors. As such, it was found unconscionable for the employer to call on the bond for the original sum of $578,140 which represented 30% of the revised contract sum.

49     In the present case, the Architect’s revised IC24a showed that the original and adjusted contract sum to be the same _ie_ $2,296,386.98[^27]. The valuation of the works done cannot be taken as equivalent to a revision of the contract price. Otherwise, every time there is a variation in the valuation of the works upon the submission of a progress claim, this would mean that the Bond amount would have to be adjusted accordingly. The aim of the Bond is to serve as a security for the due performance of the contractor’s obligations under the Contract. In this case, there is no prejudice to the applicant as the first respondent’s claim for delay and defects is for the total sum of $322,290. Should the first respondent succeed in its claim entirely, there would still be a shortfall of over $90,000 that has to be borne by the applicant.

50     While I was initially persuaded that the call on the Bond should not exceed 10% of the contract sum, it appeared that parties were unable to agree on what that sum should be. Hence, I was reluctant to give any consequential directions for payment of a reduced sum by the second respondent in default of the parties’ agreement on what that sum should be, and in the absence of any unequivocal evidence of the same.

## Conclusion

51     There was no unconscionability found on the part of the first respondent in its call on the Bond which led to the OS being dismissed.

52     The court was informed that an offer to settle (“OTS”) had been made by the first respondent to the applicant on 21 September 2021 before the second round of affidavits were filed. The terms of the OTS were for the applicant to withdraw its action with each party bearing its own costs. As the applicant clearly did not obtain a judgment that could be said to be more favourable than the terms of the OTS, I agreed that the first respondent was entitled to indemnity costs from the date of the OTS. Taking into account wasted costs due to delay on the part of the first respondent and the work done for the interim injunction hearing, I fixed costs in the sum of $10,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed failing which they are to be fixed by the court.
