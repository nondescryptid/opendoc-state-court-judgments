### Deputy Registrar Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       This action arose from a rear-end collision between motor vehicles driven by the parties. The Plaintiff, the driver of the leading vehicle, alleged that the collision inflicted various personal injuries, including a grade 2 whiplash injury. The Defendant admits to being responsible for the collision but contends that the impact of the collision was too minor to inflict the whiplash injury as alleged. The injury, the Defendant argued, was actually the product of a pre-existing neck injury caused by a different tortfeasor in an earlier motor accident. In these premises, the central issue before me was whether the Plaintiff has established the causal link between the whiplash injury and the present accident. Before I address this issue, I begin with a narration of the relevant background facts.

## Background facts

2       The present accident took place on 11 May 2015 (the “2015 Accident”).[^1] The Defendant’s vehicle rear-ended the Plaintiff’s vehicle while it was stationary.[^2] According to the Plaintiff, the sudden impact of the collision caused his body to reel forward and backward.[^3] He immediately felt pain in his neck and lower back region, and was treated at the Accident & Emergency (“A&E”) department of the National University Hospital (“NUH”).[^4] On examination, Dr Srinesh Balakrishnan (“Dr Balakrishnan”) diagnosed him with a neck sprain and right wrist sprain and issued a medical leave of 5 days from 11 to 15 May 2015.[^5]

3       As the pain persisted for more than a week, the Plaintiff consulted Dr S R E Sayampanthan, an orthopaedic specialist on 19 May 2015.[^6] On examination, Dr Sayampanthan diagnosed the following injuries:[^7]

> (a)     whiplash injury to the neck (Quebec Classification Grade 2) (“Whiplash Injury”) and aggravation of pre-existing neck injuries;

> (b)     soft tissue injury to lower back;

> (c)     soft tissue injury to left thumb; and

> (d)     soft tissue injury to right wrist.

4       Dr Sayampanthan gave the Plaintiff hospitalisation leave from 19 to 29 May 2015, and subsequently another one from 15 to 21 June 2015 following a second review conducted on 15 June 2015.[^8] To manage the injuries, Dr Sayampanthan also referred the Plaintiff for physiotherapy.[^9]

## Whether the Whiplash Injury was caused by the 2015 Accident

5       The Defendant admits to being responsible for the collision but disputes the causal link between the collision and the Whiplash Injury.[^10] In this regard, the Defendant argued that the impact of the collision was not forceful enough to inflict a whiplash injury of grade 2 severity.[^11] The main evidence relied upon were photographs showing the damage done to both parties’ vehicles were minimal. In this regard, there were no visible dents though the collision did dislodge the number plate on the Defendant’s car and leave some scratch marks on the Plaintiff’s car.[^12] Further, the Defendant insinuated that the symptoms were attributable to the Plaintiff’s pre-existing injuries.[^13] It is undisputed that, right before the 2015 Accident, the Plaintiff had some residual neck pain, arising from an earlier road accident that he was involved in about a year ago on 25 May 2014 (the “2014 Accident”).[^14] The 2014 Accident also inflicted on him a grade 2 whiplash injury.[^15]

6       In favour of the Plaintiff’s case is the evidence of Dr Sayampanthan. Dr Sayampanthan, in his capacity as the medical expert jointly appointed by the parties, took the position that the Plaintiff did suffer a neck injury from the 2015 Accident.[^16] He made the assessment based on a physical examination of the Plaintiff during which he observed “a lot of tenderness and muscle spasm”.[^17] He maintained this view after being shown the damage photos of the vehicles.[^18] While he was unable to measure the force of the collision from the photos, he said that the mechanism of the accident, namely, a front to rear collision which caused the Plaintiff’s body to jerk forward, was capable of inflicting a whiplash injury.[^19] Dr Sayampanthan further said that the neck sprain diagnosed by the doctor who treated the Plaintiff at NUH corroborates his diagnosis.[^20] When asked why his diagnosis of a whiplash differs from the NUH doctor’s diagnosis of a neck sprain, he explained that whiplash injuries can take time to develop, in that patients may start experiencing the symptoms over a period of 24-72 hours after the accident.[^21]

7       I considered the possibility that the Plaintiff was already suffering from the whiplash symptoms diagnosed by Dr Sayampanthan before the 2015 Accident, such that the whiplash symptoms would have persisted even without the 2015 Accident. The evidence on record signals that this possibility is unrealistic. The Plaintiff’s averred in his AEIC that the pain symptoms from the prior injury had _almost completely receded_ right before the 2015 Accident.[^22] This averment went unchallenged during cross-examination. That being the case, the Defendant is deemed to have accepted the Plaintiff’s account of events, by virtue of the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67, which requires witnesses be given an opportunity to respond to allegations made against their evidence (_Tan Kok Yong Steve v Itochu Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 85</span> at \[44\]).

8       The Defendant contended that the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ is inapplicable in the present case because the Defendant had notified the Plaintiff of its case prior to the assessment of damages hearing.[^23] In this regard, the Defendant relied on the interlocutory judgment entered against the Defendant in which the Defendant reserved the issue of causation for the assessment of damages.[^24] The Defendant also referred to the case of _Chan Emily v Kang Hock Chai Joachim_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 37</span> (“_Emily Chan_”), arguing that the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ is a “technical rule” developed in a time where “opposing parties did not disclose evidence to each other by way of \[Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”)\]”.[^25] This submission is misguided. First of all, the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ remains very much alive. Just recently, it was successfully invoked in _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 25</span>, a decision issued by the Court of Appeal. In that case, the Prosecution’s failure to put an important point to the accused during trial precluded them from running it in closing submissions (at \[134\]). In civil proceedings, the rule was endorsed in similar fashion by the Court of Appeal in _Sudha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 141</span> at \[48\], where the respondent was not allowed to advance a case that was not put to the appellant at trial.

9       While the rule in _Brown v Dunn_ does not require every point to be put to the witness, the _raison d’etre_ of the rule requires _witnesses be given an opportunity to explain allegations that go to the heart of the matter (Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 292</span> at \[42\]). This is especially important in personal injury cases like this where the Defendant, unlike the defendant in _Emily Chan_, dispensed with the filing of a Defence and an AEIC. The reservation made in the interlocutory judgment is not specific and granular enough to put the Plaintiff on notice of the precise allegations that the Defendant intends to advance. By the time the allegation is finally raised in closing submissions, the plaintiff would have been irreparably prejudiced by being deprived of the opportunity to contradict it, either in his testimony or by leading rebuttal evidence. This is not a case where it could be said with conviction that notice of the precise allegation had so distinctly and unmistakably been given and it would be a waste of time to put that allegation to the witness (_Kwee Seng Chio Peter v Biogenics Sdn Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 482</span> at \[21\]).

10     In the present case, the status of the Plaintiff’s pre-existing injury is pivotal to both the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s case theories. Whose case theory would prevail largely depends on the factual finding made on this issue. It is therefore critical for the Defendant to have challenged the Plaintiff on this averment, if it had wanted to make good the contention that the Whiplash Injury was caused by 2014 Accident and not the 2015 Accident. Since it did not do so, it is no longer open to the Defendant to challenge the averment retrospectively. Indeed, the Defendant did not even raise such a challenge in its closing submissions. Its case is simply that the Plaintiff had not established causation on a balance of probabilities.

11     Viewed in the context of the substantial recovery that the Plaintiff has made from the prior whiplash injury right before the 2015 Accident, Dr Balakrishnan’s diagnosis of a neck sprain followed by Dr Sayampanthan’s diagnosis of a grade 2 whiplash injury after the 2015 Accident collectively points to the 2015 Accident as the cause of the Whiplash Injury. The traditional “but for” test for proving causation is plainly satisfied – but for the 2015 Accident, the Plaintiff would not have suffered the Whiplash Injury (Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at \[07.017\]).

12     While the Plaintiff experienced some residual pain right before the 2015 Accident, there is no evidence to suggest that the symptoms were of the same severity as that diagnosed by Dr Sayampanthan or that the pre-existing injury would degenerate to produce such symptoms even without the accident. In fact, the evidence suggested otherwise. In this regard, the Plaintiff averred that he was treated conservatively for the prior injury for which he had attended only two (2) physiotherapy sessions.[^26] By his account, he had substantially recovered. Once again, this averment went unchallenged during cross-examination, thereby precluding the Defendant from raising retrospective challenges.

13     Further, while Dr Sayampanthan elaborated during the hearing that part of the tenderness and muscle spasm could be attributed to the 2014 Accident,[^27] he did not go as far as to say that the 2014 Accident had caused or materially contributed to the Whiplash Injury. What he meant was the symptoms could be attributed in part to the residual pain that the Plaintiff had right before the 2015 Accident. The main thrust of his evidence was that the 2015 Accident had aggravated the pre-existing neck problems.[^28] Given the factual finding that the pre-existing neck problems were minor, it follows that the 2015 Accident was the “effective” or “dominant” cause of the Whiplash Injury. As the Court of Appeal observed in _The “Cherry” and others_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 471</span> (at \[68\]):

> … \[A\] claimant can recover damages … where that breach (or wrong) was the “effective” or “dominant” cause of the loss. The courts adopt a common sense approach in interpreting the facts of each case to determine whether the breach was the cause of the loss or merely gave the opportunity for the loss to be sustained. …

14     In these premises, the Defendant must therefore be responsible for the Whiplash Injury, save for the residual pain that the Plaintiff was suffering right before the 2015 Accident.

15     In arriving at this conclusion, I am of the view that the Plaintiff has discharged the burden of proving causation on a balance of probabilities. It is trite that the legal burden of proof for establishing causation rests and remains with the Plaintiff (_Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 782</span> at \[71\]). The _evidential_ burden is however capable of shifting to the Defendant to show an absence of causation. To shift the evidential burden, the plaintiff must adduce some (not inherently incredible) evidence of the existence of the facts asserted (_Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith & Associates Far East, Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 855</span> at \[60\]). Upon adduction of that evidence, the evidential burden shifts to the defendant to adduce rebuttal evidence. If no rebuttal evidence is adduced, the court may conclude from the plaintiff has discharged its legal burden.

16     The case of _King Fish v Wee Meng Tugboat Service_ \[1994\] 3 SLR(R) 059 illustrates the shifting of the evidential burden in the context of a negligence claim. In that case, the plaintiff sued the defendant for damage done to his fish farm, caused by a collision with the defendant’s tug boats which were not properly moored during a storm. The defendant denied the alleged collision had taken place. The plaintiff’s evidence was that the proprietor had witnessed the collision (at \[21\]). The High Court Judge dismissed the claim due to the lack of evidence of the actual mooring position of the tug boats (at \[25\]). Overturning this ruling on appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff did not bear the burden of proving the mooring position of the tug boats (at \[26\]). What it had to prove was that a collision did take place. This the plaintiff did, by relying on the sound testimony given by the plaintiff’s witness. Consequently, the evidential burden shifted to the defendant to prove that the tug boats could not have collided with the fish farm (at \[27\]). The defendant, however, could not produce credible evidence to show that the tug boats did not collide into the fish farm (at \[27\]). As a result, the defendant did not discharge its evidential burden and was liable for the collision.

17     Returning to the present case, the Plaintiff discharged its evidential burden for the reasons mentioned above. The effect of this is to shift the evidential burden to the Defendant to lead rebuttal evidence. The Defendant however fell short. The strongest evidence in favour of the Defendant’s case was the damage photos showing minimal damage to the Plaintiff’s vehicle. That alone, however, is not enough. On the present facts, I am unable to conclusively determine the impact speed of the collision based on the photos and whether such impact was capable of inflicting a whiplash injury of grade 2 severity on the Plaintiff. To make good its case, the Defendant could perhaps have called an accident reconstructionist to give evidence on these matters, like what was done by the defendant in _Mark Amaraganthan Selvaganthan v Cheung Man Wai_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 253</span>.

18     Further, if the Defendant’s case is that the Plaintiff had not recovered from the 2014 Accident right before the 2015 Accident, it should have, as stated above, put this into issue and lead evidence on the same. For instance, it could have called the doctors who treated the prior injury to give evidence. The Defendant’s decision not to call rebuttal evidence puts a further dent on its case theory.

19     Instead of leading rebuttal evidence, the Defendant raised a litany of arguments, all of which are wide off the mark. For completeness, I will address the salient points briefly. First, the Defendant argues that the Plaintiff had given inconsistent accounts of the state of his pre-existing neck injury.[^29] In this regard, the Plaintiff’s evidence was the pain symptoms had “almost completely receded just prior to \[the 2015 Accident\]”,[^30] whereas Dr Sayampanthan’s medical report recorded him saying that there was “some residual pain and stiffness in the neck just before the \[2015 Accident\]”.[^31] In my judgment, the Defendant is splitting hairs. The two statements are consistent with each other. The former says that he has made substantial recovery. The latter addresses the residual pain from which he has not fully recovered. I have no difficulty reconciling them.

20     Next, I address the main precedent cited by the Defendant: _Menjit Singh s/o Hari Singh v Ong Lay Peng_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 11</span> (“_Menjit Singh_”).[^32] In _Menjit Singh_, the claimant used for damages arising from a whiplash suffered in a relatively minor car accident in a car park. The claimant sued for not only pain and suffering of the injuries but also loss of earnings as a teacher, alleging that the injury had rendered him unable to teach. The trial judge ruled in favour of the claimant and ordered the bulk of the damages claimed in excess of $1 million. The defendant appealed against the loss of earnings award but did not appeal against a sum of $12,000 awarded for the pain and suffering that arose from the injury, and a sum of $21,000 awarded as special damages. The issue on appeal was whether the claimant had indeed been suffering from “chronic whiplash”, a condition so serious that he could no longer continue working as a teacher. Justice Tan Lee Meng found that the symptoms were exaggerated and that the claimant could have continued working as a teacher. Justice Tan disbelieved the claimant was suffering from all 23 symptoms of chronic whiplash injury – many of which were not disclosed to the doctors he had consulted. Private surveillance video tapes adduced by the defendant showed that the claimant could carry on with daily activities without any problems, which implied that the alleged neck problems he had were not bad enough to prevent him from working as a teacher (at \[58\]). The defendant’s medical expert also testified that the disability that the claimant had did not preclude him from continuing to work as a teacher (at \[54\]).

21     In my view, _Menjit Singh_ does not assist the Defendant. The only commonality is perhaps the fact that the claimant there similarly suffered a whiplash injury arising from a minor vehicular collision. Beyond that, the evidence, arguments and issues featured in _Menjit Singh_ are vastly different.

> (a)     The injuries alleged in that case were far more serious. The claimant alleged that the “chronic whiplash” was so bad that he could no longer continue working as a teacher. Here, the Plaintiff did not go so far – the whiplash injury concerned did not prevent the Plaintiff from continue working. The Plaintiff’s claim is limited to general damages for pain and suffering associated with the whiplash injury. In fact, the claimant in _Menjit Singh_ successfully recovered $12,000 in damages for the pain and suffering associated with the injuries. The issue on appeal was whether the claimant was entitled to recover loss of earnings as a teacher. In the present case, the Plaintiff did not make a claim for loss of earnings.

> (b)     The defendant in _Menjit Singh_ had alleged that the claimant was exaggerating the symptoms in a bid to bolster his claim. Here, no such allegation was made against the Plaintiff. That the Plaintiff did suffer the Whiplash Injury is not in dispute. The question was whether that injury was caused by the 2015 Accident.

> (c)     Most importantly, the evidence in _Menjit Singh_ amply justified the finding that the claimant was exaggerating the whiplash symptoms. As mentioned above, the claimant did not mention many of the symptoms complained of during his medical consultations. The medical experts opined that the claimant had psychologically magnified the symptoms. In this regard, even the claimant’s expert conceded that the claimant had exaggerated the symptoms by 30%. The claimant’s medical expert also failed to conduct objective tests, choosing instead to accept the claimant’s complaints of pain and discomfort and face value. The final blow to the claimant’s case were the surveillance footage showing that the claimant had no difficulty carrying on his daily activities. None of such rebuttal evidence featured in the present case. On the contrary, the Plaintiff’s case is grounded on unchallenged factual and medical evidence. As I have mentioned above, the Defendant’s failure to lead rebuttal evidence proved fatal to its case.

22     For all these reasons, I am of the view that _Menjit Singh_ is distinguishable. It does little to advance the Defendant’s case.

23     In conclusion, I find that the Plaintiff has established the causal link between the Whiplash Injury and the 2015 Accident on a balance of probabilities.

24     I turn now to assess the amount of damages for the Whiplash Injury.

## Quantum of damages for pain and suffering

### Whiplash Injury

25     Dr Sayampanthan diagnosed a whiplash injury of grade 2 severity according to the Quebec Classification of Whiplash-Associated Disorders. According to the said classification, whiplash injuries of this severity entails neck complaints of pain and the examining doctor finds decreased range of motion and point tenderness in the neck. As a starting point, awards for such injuries typically range from $7,000 to $8,000 (Charlene Chee _et al_, _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (the “_Guidelines_”)). Such injuries typically take about two years to resolve with residual long-term disabilities (the _Guidelines_ at p 20).

26     In the present case, the Whiplash Injury resulted in a total of 23 days of medical/hospitalisation leave.[^33] The Plaintiff’s evidence was that the pain symptoms disrupted his sleep pattern and sleeping posture. According to him, he would at times wake up with stiffness in his neck.He also had to sleep in certain positions to avoid aggravating the pain.[^34] In the months preceding the accident, he began swimming, running and gym on a weekly basis. The fresh bout of injuries confined his exercise routine to brief swims.[^35] In the span of about two years, he attended three medical consultations and 97 physiotherapy sessions.[^36] In or around April 2017, he reduced his weekly physiotherapy sessions to fortnightly sessions.[^37] As at December 2018, which was when he filed his AEIC, the pain had significantly improved and he only experienced occasional neck pain. He only attended physiotherapy sessions as and when he required relief from the symptoms.[^38] The Plaintiff’s account was once again unchallenged. Given that the injuries are by no means trivial, the $300 compensation offered by the Defendant is plainly inadequate. The only authority cited for this is _Yap Pow Kin v Muhammad bin Johari_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 40</span> (“_Yap Pow Kin_”), a case involving a form of whiplash injury that was far less serious. In that case, the sum of $300 awarded was for a grade 1 whiplash injury that was observed by the Court to have been “transient and not significant” (at \[15\]). This can hardly compare to the injuries sustained by the Plaintiff.

27     The Plaintiff claims $12,000 for the pain and suffering associated with the whiplash injury, justifying the uplift by reference the case of _Scott Grayham De Silva v Comfort Transportation Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 215</span> (“_Scott Grayham_”).[^39] The claimant in that case suffered a grade 2 whiplash injury and an aggravation of pre-existing cervical spondylosis. The court at first instance awarded $7,000 for the whiplash injury. On appeal, the Court increased the award to $11,000 to take into account the aggravation of the pre-existing cervical spondylosis. The Plaintiff argued that the present diagnosis of a grade 2 whiplash injury coupled with “an aggravation of pre-existing neck problems” should similarly warrant an uplift to the award typically given for grade 2 whiplash injury.

28     In my judgment, the diagnosis of an “aggravation of pre-existing neck problems” does not justify an uplift to the award for grade 2 whiplash injuries. Unlike the claimant in _Scott Grayham_ whose intermittent neck pain had “become chronic” some two years three months after the accident, there is no evidence to suggest that the Plaintiff’s neck pain had progressively worsened or become chronic. The symptoms experienced by the Plaintiff are consistent with those typically associated with grade 2 whiplash injuries, namely, that such injuries takes about two years to resolve with residual long-term disabilities (_Guidelines_ at p 20). By April 2017, some two years after the 2015 Accident, the Plaintiff must have substantially recovered from the injuries, such that he no longer attended physiotherapy sessions on a weekly basis. As at December 2018, which was when he filed his AEIC, the pain had almost completely subsided and by then the Plaintiff only experienced occasional pain. In short, the aggravation did not amount to a _distinct injury_. It is at best an “overlapping” injury (_Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> at \[17\]). Since “overlapping” injuries do not result in different set of pain or disability, issuing a separate set of damages in respect of such injuries is plainly unjustified.

29     In this regard, I echo the observation made in _Yap Pow Kin_ that the focus should be on the pain and suffering experienced by the claimant, and less so on the semantics of the diagnosis (_Yap Pow Kin_ at \[41\]). It is important not to forget that the end goal is to quantify the pain and suffering experienced by the claimant. This is especially so when a diagnosis made years ago does not commensurate with the actual trajectory of the injury as at the date of the hearing. I also find the following observation made by the Court of Appeal to be apposite (see _Armstrong, Carol Ann (executrix of the estate of Peter Traynor, deceased, and on behalf of the dependents of Peter Traynor, deceased) v Quest Laboratories Pte Ltd and another and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 133</span> at \[92\]):

> The \[Court\] is not bound to accept any expert opinion in its _entirety_. The ultimate consideration in deciding whether to reject or accept expert evidence, and whether to do so in part or in whole, is driven by, among other things, considerations of consistency, logic and coherence, and with a powerful focus on the objective evidence before the court.

> \[emphasis in original\]

30     In fact, even if one were to focus on the diagnosis, I would venture to say the “aggravation of pre-existing neck injuries” was probably not diagnosed as a separate injury. As Dr Sayampanthan explained during the hearing, the “tenderness and muscle spasms” in the neck was attributable to _both_ a whiplash grade 2 injury and an aggravation of pre-existing neck problems.[^40] He said it was not possible for him to apportion the injuries between the two sources.[^41] In effect, what Dr Sayampanthan meant was that the “aggravation of pre-existing neck injuries” had _contributed_ to the neck injuries, as opposed to being a standalone injury.

31     The fact that Dr Sayampanthan did not specifically refer to an “aggravation” of the Plaintiff’s “cervical spondylosis” reinforces my understanding that he did not (and could not at that point in time) diagnose as such. It is also significant to note that, in _Scott Grayham_, the claimant did not receive the diagnosis of “aggravation of the pre-existing cervical spondylosis” immediately after the accident. The condition was diagnosed almost three years after the accident, in circumstances where the neck pain had become chronic. In the present case, the Plaintiff had only consulted Dr Sayampanthan on two occasions shortly after the accident – without any further consultations on his pre-existing cervical spondylosis. There is therefore no evidence to support a finding that the 2015 Accident had aggravated his pre-existing cervical spondylosis, and more importantly, even if there were such aggravation, there is nothing to suggest that it would have a material impact on the Plaintiff’s well-being.

32     All things considered, I award the Plaintiff $9,000 in respect of the Whiplash Injury. In arriving at this amount, I have also considered that inconvenience that the injury has brought to the Plaintiff, including the many physiotherapy sessions that he had attended over two years. While I accept that, as at December 2018 which was when he filed his AEIC, he continued to experience occasional pain in the neck, I would not give an uplift for that, simply because doing so would put him in a better position than where he was prior to the 2015 Accident. At that time, the Plaintiff had not fully recovered from the 2014 Accident, and was similarly suffering from some residual pain in the neck. The goal of tort law is to return the claimant to its original position before the wrongdoing, not better and not worse. This is consistent with the well-established principle that a tortfeasor takes the victim as he finds him. To treat the Plaintiff as though he was an unharmed, asymptomatic individual would be to overcompensate him (see for instance, _Performance Cars Ltd v Abraham_ <span class="citation">\[1962\] 1 QB 33</span> at 40).

### The remaining soft tissue injuries

33     I turn now to address the remaining soft tissue injuries mentioned at \[2\] above: soft tissue injury to lower back; soft tissue injury to left thumb; and soft tissue injury to right wrist. The Defendant does not dispute that these injuries flowed from the 2015 Accident. The dispute centres on the compensation amount.

34     The unchallenged evidence is that it took about two years for the back pain to improve.[^42] The Defendant submits that this injury should attract no more than an award of $1,000. Based on recovery time of about two years, this amount is manifestly inadequate. The _Guidelines_ provides that the compensation award for minor back injuries that are resolved within two years or so is $2,000 or less. The Plaintiff’s back injury fits this description. I therefore award $2,000 in respect of this injury, which is the amount sought by the Plaintiff.

35     The soft tissue injuries to the right wrist and left thumb were far less serious. There is no evidence on how long the pain lasted. Neither injury necessitated further consultation or treatment. Presumably, the pain resolved itself shortly after the 2015 Accident with no residual disabilities. As such, I award $600 in respect of each injury. In making this assessment, I had regard to the sum of $500 prescribed in the _Guidelines_ for a “contusion” (at p 59).

### Summary

36     In sum, total quantum of the general damages awarded for the pain and suffering arising from the injuries mentioned above is **$12,200**. In the course of my assessment, I have taken into consideration the monetary inflation that has accrued since the publication of the _Guidelines_ in 2010 (_Chang Mui Hoon v Lim Bee Leng_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHCR 17</span> at \[15\]).

## Quantum of damages for medical and transport expenses

37     As for special damages, the Plaintiff is claiming $108 in medical expenses[^43] and $92.08 in transport expenses.[^44] On the last day of the hearing,[^45] counsel for the Plaintiff informed the Court that he has decided to abandon his claim for physiotherapy expenses. Parties also agreed on the medical expenses claim, leaving the transport expenses claim to be determined.

38     The breakdown of the transport expenses claim is as follows:[^46]

> (a)     one return trip to NUH at $18.02 per return trip, totalling $36.04;

> (b)     two return trips to Dr Sayampanthan at $32.36 per return trip, totalling $64.72; and

> (c)     one return trip to Parkway East Hospital (for physiotherapy) at $9.34 per return trip, totalling $9.34.

39     The Plaintiff did not adduce any receipts to support his claim. Instead, he used an online taxi calculator to compute the putative taxi fares.[^47] This is problematic because, as he revealed during the hearing, he did not actually travel by taxi, but rather by his personal car.[^48] He claimed that he could not ascertain the amount of petrol consumed for the trips.[^49] The difficulty with his case is that the petrol required for these trips would certainly cost less than the taxi fare incurred for the equivalent distance travelled. With the claim premised on petrol costs only, assessing the award based on the putative taxi fares would lead to overcompensation. What the Plaintiff should have done is to adduce evidence of petrol receipts, fuel consumption rate of his car model and the driving distance between the various places. This would have provided some basis to assess the actual transport expenses incurred. Since he did not do so, I can only make a reasonable estimate of the transport expenses. Any such estimate must be conservative to avoid putting the Plaintiff in a better position that claimants who assiduously retain receipts and produce them in evidence (_Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> at \[146\]). The Defendant submits that $20 is fair and reasonable.[^50] In the absence of evidence pointing to the contrary, I find no reason to award more.

## Conclusion

40     In summary, the heads of claim advanced by the Plaintiff are awarded as follows:

> (a)     General damages (for pain and suffering):

>> (i)       Whiplash injury: $9,000

>> (ii)       Soft tissue injury on back: $2,000

>> (iii)       Soft tissue injuries on wrist and thumb: $1,200

> (b)     Special damages:

>> (i)       Medical expenses (by consent): $108

>> (ii)       Transport expenses: $20.

> **Total: $12,328.**

41     I will hear parties on the consequential orders and the issue of costs.
