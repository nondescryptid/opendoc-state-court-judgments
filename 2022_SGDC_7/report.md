Civil Procedure – Parties

10 January 2022

### Deputy Registrar Jonathan Ng Pang Ern:

1       Summons No 4700 of 2021 was the Plaintiff’s application to, among other things, substitute the 2nd Defendant, who had died, with the 2nd Defendant’s “personal representative”. However, at the time of the application, there was no grant of probate or administration made. Could the application be granted in such circumstances? After hearing Mr Subir Singh Panoo, who appeared for the Plaintiff, I dismissed the application. These are the grounds of my decision.

## Background

2       The Plaintiff commenced suit against the Defendants on 22 September 2021.[^1] The claim arose out of a road traffic accident that took place on 24 August 2019: the 1st Defendant was the owner of the allegedly offending vehicle, while the 2nd Defendant was its driver.[^2]

3       On 8 November 2021, Mr Panoo sent a letter to the Defendants’ solicitors, giving notice that he had instructions to enter judgment if the Defence was not filed and served within 48 hours.[^3] In response, the Defendants’ solicitors sent an email stating that they had recently been informed that the 2nd Defendant had passed away on 24 February 2021.[^4] The Plaintiff thus filed this application on 1 December 2021. The application was filed as a consent summons and sought the substitution of the 2nd Defendant with the 2nd Defendant’s “personal representative”, alongside other consequential orders. The prayers were as follows:

> 1.    That the 2nd Defendant “Ng Jui Chye” be substituted with “the personal representative of Ng Jui Chye, deceased” as the 2nd Defendant for the purpose of the proceedings herein;

> 2.    That the name of the 2nd Defendant be amended to “the personal representative of Ng Jui Chye, deceased” in the Writ of Summons and all subsequent documents;

> 3.    That the (Amendment No. 1) Statement of Claim be amended as shown herein;

> 4.    That the proceedings herein continue to be carried on against 1st Defendant and the said Personal Representaive of Ng Jui Chye, deceased as the 2nd Defendant;

> 5.    The costs of and incidentals to this application be costs in the cause;

4       However, it was evident from the supporting affidavit that there was no grant of probate or administration made.[^5] It was also evident from the supporting affidavit that the Defendants’ solicitors were not acting for the Defendants _per se_. Rather, they were acting for the Defendants’ insurers.[^6]

5       The application was first fixed before me as a “paper” hearing on 1 December 2021. I had some doubts as to whether the application, as framed, could be granted because O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) appeared to require the identification of a person to represent the deceased’s estate in circumstances where there was no grant of probate or administration made. I expressed this concern to Mr Panoo by way of Registrar’s Direction(s) and fixed a further “paper” hearing on 22 December 2021. Mr Panoo wrote in on 3 December 2021 and maintained the view that the application, as framed, could be granted. I therefore fixed the application for an oral hearing and heard submissions from Mr Panoo on 27 December 2021. The Defendants’ solicitors did not attend his oral hearing: Mr Panoo mentioned on their behalf.

## Plaintiff’s submissions

6       I understood the thrust of Mr Panoo’s submissions to be as follows:

> (a)     The application would not prejudice the 2nd Defendant’s estate as the Defendants’ insurers continued to represent the 2nd Defendant’s interest and conduct the 2nd Defendant’s defence.[^7] Further, the Defendants’ insurers were aware of the nature and import of the application and had given their consent to the orders sought.[^8]

> (b)     The provisions in O 15 r 6A of the Rules of Court did not require the identification of a person to represent the deceased’s estate. In particular, O 15 r 6A(2) of the Rules of Court allowed an action to be brought against the “personal representatives” of the deceased.[^9]

## Analysis

7       The issue in the application was a straightforward one: does O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court require the identification of a person to represent the deceased’s estate in circumstances where there is no grant of probate or administration made?

8       I appreciated that the application was, in practical terms, a formality. The Defendants’ insurers were, for all intents and purposes, conducting the litigation on behalf of the 2nd Defendant and the actual identity of the 2nd Defendant was therefore not substantively material. Moreover, as Mr Panoo submitted, there was no prejudice to the 2nd Defendant’s estate, and the Defendants’ insurers had consented to the application (see \[6(a)\] above). These were all compelling points but, ultimately, and perhaps unfortunately, did not obviate the need for the Rules of Court to be complied with. To this end, I took the view that, where there is no grant of probate or administration made, an application under O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court requires a person to be identified. It is not sufficient, in these circumstances, for the plaintiff to apply for the “personal representatives” of the deceased to be made a party to the proceedings.

9       First, the plain wording of O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court makes this clear. This provision states as follows:

> (4)    In any such action as is referred to in paragraph (1) or (3) —

>> (_a_)    the plaintiff shall, during the period of validity for service of the writ or originating summons, apply to the Court for _an order appointing a_ **_person_** _to represent the deceased’s estate for the purpose of the proceedings_ or, _if a grant of probate or administration has been made_ for _an order that the_ **_personal representative_** _of the deceased be made a party to the proceedings_, and in either case for an order that the proceedings be carried on against the **_person appointed_** or, as the case may be, against the **_personal representative_**, as if he had been substituted for the estate; and

> \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

10     Thus, O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court contemplates two scenarios:

> (a)     The first scenario is where “a grant of probate or administration has been made”. In this scenario, the application shall be for “an order that the _personal representative_ of the deceased be made a party to the proceedings” \[emphasis added\].

> (b)     The second scenario is not explicitly spelt out but, by implication, is where a grant of probate or administration has not been made. In this scenario, the application shall be for “an order appointing a _person_ to represent the deceased’s estate for the purpose of the proceedings” \[emphasis added\].

11     This distinction is also drawn in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2021_ vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2021) at para 15/6A/6. Indeed, it also finds expression in the later part of O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court, which states that in both scenarios, the application shall also be for “an order that the proceedings be carried on against the _person appointed_ **_or_**, as the case may be, against the _personal representative_, as if he had been substituted for the estate” \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\].

12     This distinction is significant. If it were sufficient, in both scenarios, for the “personal representatives” of the deceased to be made a party to the proceedings, there would have been no need for O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court to draw this distinction and make repeated reference to the “person” appointed to represent the deceased’s estate.

13     Second, this distinction makes sense. The term “personal representatives” is commonly used to refer to either the executors or administrators of a deceased’s estate (see, _eg_, _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 15 (LexisNexis, 2019) at para 190.004). In circumstances where there is no grant of probate or administration made, there are simply no “personal representatives” to speak of. This point might appear theoretical but it does have practical implications. Order 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court must be interpreted in a manner that is capable of general application. While it was fortuitous, in the present case, that the Defendants’ insurers were conducting the litigation on behalf of the 2nd Defendant (see \[8\] above), this will not be the case in many other cases. Practical difficulties will then arise. Taking an obvious example, who should Court documents addressed to the “personal representatives” be served on when no such “personal representatives” actually exist?

14     It is true that, as Mr Panoo submitted (see \[6(b)\] above), O 15 r 6A(2) of the Rules of Court allows an action to be brought against the “personal representatives” of the deceased. However, it is important to read O 15 r 6A(2) of the Rules of Court in context. In this regard, O 15 r 6A(1)–(4) of the Rules of Court provide as follows:

> **Proceedings against estates (O. 15, r. 6A)**

> **6A.**—(1)    Where any person against whom an action would have lain has died but the cause of action survives, the action may, if no grant of probate or administration has been made, be brought against the estate of the deceased.

> (2)    Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), an action brought against “the personal representatives of A.B. deceased” shall be treated, for the purposes of that paragraph, as having been brought against his estate.

> (3)    An action purporting to have been commenced against a person shall be treated, if he was dead at its commencement, as having been commenced against his estate in accordance with paragraph (1), whether or not a grant of probate or administration was made before its commencement.

> (4)    In any such action as is referred to in paragraph (1) or (3) —

>> (_a_)    the plaintiff shall, during the period of validity for service of the writ or originating summons, apply to the Court for an order appointing a person to represent the deceased’s estate for the purpose of the proceedings or, if a grant of probate or administration has been made for an order that the personal representative of the deceased be made a party to the proceedings, and in either case for an order that the proceedings be carried on against the person appointed or, as the case may be, against the personal representative, as if he had been substituted for the estate; and

>> (_b_)    the Court may, at any stage of the proceedings and on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application, make any such order as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (_a_) and allow such amendments (if any) to be made and make such other order as the Court thinks necessary in order to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceedings may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon.

15     These provisions collectively deal with cases where a deceased has died prior to the bringing of an action. They establish the following scheme:

> (a)     Order 15 r 6A(1) and (2) of the Rules of Court deal with the situation where the plaintiff is, at the time the action is brought, _aware_ that the deceased has died. Order 15 r 6A(1) of the Rules of Court allows such an action to be brought against the deceased’s estate, while O 15 r 6A(2) of the Rules of Court treats an action brought against the “personal representatives” of the deceased as having been brought against his estate.

> (b)     In contrast, O 15 r 6A(3) of the Rules of Court deals with the situation where the plaintiff is, at the time the action is brought, _not aware_ that the deceased has died. Notwithstanding that such an action is brought against the deceased _per se_, O 15 r 6A(3) of the Rules of Court treats the action as having been commenced against the deceased’s estate and therefore valid pursuant to O 15 r 6A(1) of the Rules of Court.

> (c)     In both situations above, the plaintiff must, within the validity period for service of the writ or originating summons and pursuant to O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court, apply to the Court for the relevant order.

16     The present case fell within the second situation described at \[15(b)\] above. Order 15 r 6A(2) of the Rules of Court was therefore not directly applicable. But could O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court nevertheless be interpreted in light of O 15 r 6A(2) of the Rules of Court? In my view, it could not. Even where O 15 r 6A(2) of the Rules of Court is directly applicable, the Rules of Court do not allow the action brought against the “personal representatives” of the deceased to remain as it is. As mentioned at \[15(c)\] above, the plaintiff must _still_, within the validity period for service of the writ or originating summons and pursuant to O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court, apply to the Court for the relevant order. This brings us back to the plain wording of O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court and the distinction it draws (see \[9\]–\[12\] above). In other words, the meaning of O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court cannot be derived from O 15 r 6A(1)–(3) (and, in particular, O 15 r 6A(2)) of the Rules of Court because O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court refers to an application that has to be made precisely when the situations in O 15 r 6A(1)–(3) of the Rules of Court arise.

17     Third, this distinction might give rise to some concern if it were to leave a plaintiff without remedy where a person cannot be identified to represent the deceased’s estate. However, this is not the case. In _Ratan Tuzul Islam Mazumder v Ergo Insurance Pte Ltd (personal representative of the estate of Fang Wee Shyong, deceased) and another_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 265</span> (“_Ratan Tuzul_”), the District Court held (at \[10\]–\[17\]) that the person appointed to represent the deceased’s estate under O 15 r 6A(4) of the Rules of Court must have consented to such appointment. Following the decision of the High Court of Justice of Northern Ireland in _Firth Finance and General Limited v McNarry_ \[1987\] NI 125 (“_Firth Finance_”), the Court held (at \[12\]) that requiring such consent does not leave a plaintiff without recourse even if all of the deceased’s “intimates” whom the plaintiff manages to contact decline to represent the deceased’s estate. This is because the plaintiff might, in such circumstances, apply to have his own nominee appointed as the person to represent the deceased’s estate. As to how this would work, the Court went on to explain as follows (at \[14\]–\[15\]):

> 14    It was not suggested that there is in Singapore a right equivalent or similar to the right to a fair trial set out in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Absent such a right, I did not think that it was objectionable in principle to permit a plaintiff to appoint a “puppet” to represent the estate of a deceased defendant. This does not mean of course that the plaintiff is given _carte blanche_ to appoint whomsoever he wishes. Ideally the representative should be someone closely connected to the deceased, for instance a spouse or family member or trusted friend. If there is no such person willing to consent then the next-best alternative will in all likelihood be a “responsible, professional person” (in the words of Master Bell in \[_Steven Turner and Carol Turner v Patrick Kearney_ \[2010\] NI Master 10\]). But if even such a professional person proves elusive I see no good reason to restrict the class of candidates to whom the plaintiff might have resort. If the plaintiff satisfies the court that he has taken all reasonable steps to bring in someone appropriate to represent the deceased defendant’s estate but has not been able to secure consent from anyone, in my opinion it would be wholly fair and just to appoint the plaintiff’s nominee, even a “puppet”, given that the blameless plaintiff would otherwise be left without a remedy. This is provided that the plaintiff has given notice of his proposed appointment to all persons who to his knowledge may have interests aligned with those of the deceased defendant’s estate, even if those persons may previously have intimated an unwillingness to represent the estate: as Murray J pointed out in _Firth Finance_ (at 128B), this is because the attitude of those persons “may change” when they learn that the plaintiff is proposing to appoint his own nominee. …

> 15    Once the plaintiff has had his nominee appointed to represent the deceased’s estate, he may carry on the proceedings against the estate. I would think that in participating in the proceedings the plaintiff’s nominee owes some basic duty to the deceased’s estate – perhaps a duty not to act in bad faith – but I would imagine it very easy to fulfil this duty if indeed no one else has stepped forward to represent the estate despite having been given the opportunity to do so. Thus I should assume that the plaintiff would inevitably obtain judgment against the estate. If by that time no grant of probate or administration has been made the estate will be bound by the judgment in accordance with O 15 r 6A(8). The plaintiff may then enforce the judgment against the estate and any other appropriate parties. …

18     A plaintiff is therefore not left without remedy even if he is unable to identify a person to represent the deceased’s estate. He might be able to have his own nominee (_ie_, a “puppet”) appointed and, subject to the caveats in _Ratan Tuzul_, might even enjoy the corresponding advantages of such appointment.

## Conclusion

19     For the reasons set out at \[9\]–\[18\] above, I took the view that, where there is no grant of probate or administration made, an application under O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court requires a person to be identified. It is not sufficient, in these circumstances, for the plaintiff to apply for the “personal representatives” of the deceased to be made a party to the proceedings. Having interpreted O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court in this manner, I was obliged to dismiss the application although, given the practical realities (see \[8\] above), this was not without some reluctance. However, I also made clear that this was without prejudice to the Plaintiff’s right to take up a subsequent application once the correct substitute was identified.

## Postscript

20     After I had given my decision, Mr Panoo, relying on the part of O 15 r 6A(4)(_b_) of the Rules of Court that allows the Court to make an order under O 15 r 6A(4)(_a_) of the Rules of Court “of its own motion”, asked that I appoint the 1st Defendant as the person to represent the 2nd Defendant’s estate for the purpose of the proceedings. According to Mr Panoo, the 2nd Defendant was the father of the 1st Defendant.[^10] However, _Ratan Tuzul_ requires the person appointed to represent the deceased’s estate under O 15 r 6A(4) of the Rules of Court to have consented to such appointment (see \[17\] above). As there was, at this point, no such consent from the 1st Defendant, I declined to make such an order.
