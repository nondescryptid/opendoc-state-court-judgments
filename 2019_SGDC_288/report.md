### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

## Introduction

The Accused is a 56-year-old male. He pleaded guilty to one charge under s 324 of the Penal Code[^1] of causing grievous hurt with a kitchen knife and was sentence to 15 months’ imprisonment. The Accused has appealed against that sentence. He is currently on bail and will commence serving his imprisonment term on 4 February 2020.[^2]

## Facts

2       The facts of this case, as gleaned from the Statement of Facts (to which the Accused admitted without qualification), are set out below.

3       On 9 October 2018, sometime after midnight, the victim and his friend were having drinks at a coffeeshop at Block 678A Choa Chu Kang Crescent (“the coffeeshop”). The Accused and three of his friends (Oh, Seah and Wong) were also in the coffeeshop.

4       Towards the early morning, the victim and his friend started gambling with Wong in a card game. That game ended with Wong losing a few thousand dollars. The Accused decided to use the same pack of cards to play a game with his own friends, for fun. Upon distributing the cards, the Accused realized that there were only 49 cards in the deck instead of 52 (_ie_, three cards were missing). This prompted him to accuse the victim and his friend of cheating Wong in the earlier game. A verbal altercation ensued between the Accused and the victim, during which the victim revealed his gang affiliations. The victim then flipped the table and punched the Accused’s upper lip. The Accused responded by punching the face of the victim, who ran away. The Accused, believing that the victim was going to return with a weapon, went into one of the coffeeshop’s stalls where he retrieved a knife.

5       The victim did indeed return. He drove his vehicle to the road near the coffeeshop and alighted with an aluminium pole. He then made his way to a footpath next to the coffeeshop. This footpath, which was separated from the coffeeshop by a grass verge, stood at a higher level than the coffeeshop. There was thus a short flight of concrete steps on the grass verge leading up to the footpath.

6       When the Accused spotted the victim on the footpath, he picked up the kitchen knife with his right hand and a broom with his left, rushed out of the coffeeshop and headed towards the concrete steps to meet the victim. The following events were then captured, on video, by the mobile device of a patron at the coffeeshop:

> (a)     As the Accused rushed out of the coffeeshop with the knife and broom, his friend Seah picked up a plastic chair from the coffeeshop and accompanied the Accused.

> (b)     When the Accused reached the base of the concrete steps leading up to the footpath, the victim picked up an OFO bicycle and threw it down the steps at the Accused, who dodged the bicycle. Seah threw the plastic chair at the victim.

> (c)     The Accused then walked up the concrete steps to the footpath, where he confronted the victim. A verbal altercation ensued, with the Accused pointing the kitchen knife at the victim and the victim pointing the aluminium pole at the Accused.

> (d)     At about this time, Wong approached the duo and threw a plastic chair in their direction. The chair did not hit the victim.

> (e)     The victim then hit the Accused’s face with the aluminium pole once. The Accused responded by using the kitchen knife to slash at the victim’s arms and hands repeatedly, with the intention of inflicting grievous hurt.

> (f)     In the course of this fight, Seah took another plastic chair from the coffeeshop and threw it at the victim.

> (g)     The victim, who was now bleeding profusely, ran away. The Accused gave chase. Two of the Accused’s friends, Oh (who was holding a plastic chair at the time) and Seah, joined him in pursuing the victim.

7       Eventually, the Accused, Seah and Oh ended their pursuit. The victim stopped near the door of a HDB flat at the ground level of Block 670 Choa Chu Kang Crescent. At about 4.12am, the flat’s owner called the police after spotting the victim sitting down and bleeding profusely.

8       The police arrived and the victim was conveyed to hospital. The police then followed the blood trail from where the victim was found (at Block 670 Choa Chu Kang Crescent) to the coffeeshop (at Block 678A Choa Chu Kang Crescent). That same morning, the accused returned to the coffeeshop. When he saw the police in the vicinity, he decided to surrender himself at the Neighbourhood Police Post.

9       As a result of the attack by the Accused, the victim sustained the following injuries:

> (a)     Laceration to the right wrist, with laceration of the ulnar nerve and artery; and

> (b)     Laceration to the left forearm, with resulting lacerations of the following extensor tendons:

>> (i)       Extensor carpi ulnaris;

>> (ii)       Extensor digiti minimi; and

>> (iii)       Extensor digitorum communis of the ring and little fingers.

The victim had to undergo wound debridement of the right wrist, repair of the ulnar artery and nerve repair, wound debridement of the left forearm and repair of the extensor tendons listed in paragraph b(i) to (iii) above.

10     The victim was given 62 days’ hospitalisation leave,[^3] during which he was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. In particular, during the first three weeks of this period, he was unable to write, eat or work easily due to the injury on his upper limbs. At a follow-up medical examination on 11 December 2018 (_ie_, about two months after the attack), the victim’s wounds were found to have healed well but he still had diminished sensation over his right little finger and the radial aspect of his ring finger.[^4] A medical report issued on 22 March 2019 stated that the Accused had not been able to recover full function in his hands. The report opined that whether the victim will suffer permanent destruction or impairment required further time to assess. A subsequent medical report issued on 29 July 2019 stated that the Accused might have permanent incapacity, but qualified that permanent incapacity is best ascertained at least one year after surgery.

11     The victim previously worked as a general worker, which required manual labour. He has since lost his job because of his injuries and has sought financial help from social services.

12     When the Accused first appeared before me,[^5] he was charged under s 326 of the Penal Code (causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon). This was subsequently reduced to the present charge under s 324 of the Penal Code (causing hurt with a dangerous weapon), albeit the charge itself continues to refer to the victim’s injury as _grievous_ hurt:

> You … are charged that on the 9th day of October 2018, at or about 4.00am, in the vicinity of the coffeeshop at Blk 678A Choa Chu Kang Crescent, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to \[the victim), to wit, you slashed him multiple times on the arms and hands with a kitchen knife (an instrument for cutting) intending to cause him grievous hurt, causing him to suffer inter alia a right wrist laceration with laceration of the ulnar nerve and artery, and a left forearm laceration with resulting lacerations of multiple extensor tendons, leaving him unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for 62 days, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). ….

13     The Accused also sustained injuries from the fight with the victim. However, these were less extensive, comprising facial and pinna contusion, as well as a fracture at the fourth mid phalanx.

## Antecedents

14     The Accused has no past convictions for violent crimes.

## Mitigation

15     In the mitigation plea, the Defence stressed that the victim was the party who first turned hostile, by professing his gang affiliations, flipping the table and punching the Accused on the mouth. The Accused punched him back in self-defence. The Accused had armed himself with a knife thereafter only because he thought that the victim was going to return with a weapon.

16     As it turned out, the victim did return with a pole. The mitigation plea claimed that the victim then challenged the Accused to a fight. The Accused feared for his own personal safety and, acting in self-defence,[^6] picked up the kitchen knife and broom and rushed out of the coffeshop to meet the victim at the footpath. The mitigation plea maintained that even then, the Accused was reluctant to go forward. He brought the knife only as a deterrent[^7] and, to this end, warned the victim to back off.[^8] However, the victim swung the pole at the Accused a few times, hitting him on the cheek, shoulder and left finger. The mitigation plea contended that the Accused was compelled to use the knife to fend off the victim’s blows10 and, in the process, could have _accidentally_[^9] cut the victim. The mitigation plea claimed that the Accused had _no intention to inflict any injury_ on the victim.[^10]

17     During the oral hearing before me, I asked Defence Counsel if he was going to maintain his claim that there was no intention to injure the victim, as this could qualify the plea of guilt. Defence Counsel agreed to retract the claim and conceded that the intention to injure could well have developed during the fight.

18     The mitigation plea also alleged that after the victim ran off, the Accused _did not chase after him_.9 Instead, the Accused returned to the coffeeshop without even realising that the victim was injured.[^11]

## Parties’ Submissions on Sentence

#### Prosecution’s Submissions

19     The Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of at least **18 months**.

20     The Prosecution relied on the case of _Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span> (“_Ng Soon Kim_”), where Sundaresh Menon CJ set out the following three-step approach to sentencing under s 324 of the Penal Code:

> (a)     Under the first step, the court determines the notional starting sentence had the case been one of voluntarily causing hurt simpliciter, under s 323 of the Penal Code (which carries a maximum imprisonment term of only 2 years). In determining that starting sentence, regard is had to the sentencing framework governing first-time offenders pleading guilty to a charge under s 323 of the Penal Code, as set out in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”). In _Low Song Chye_, See Kee Oon J laid out three sentencing bands containing indicative starting sentences that hinge on the severity of the hurt caused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.1%"> <col width="56.56%"> <col width="31.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p class="Table-Heading-Center">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p class="Table-Heading-Center">Hurt caused</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p class="Table-Heading-Center">Indicative sentencing range</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term up to four weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (b)     Under the second step of the sentencing approach in _Ng Soon Kim_, the court adds an appropriate uplift to the starting sentence derived under the first step above, to account for the egregiousness of the dangerous weapon or means used to inflict the hurt.

> (c)     Under the third step, the court calibrates the final sentence according to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances at play.

21     The Prosecution argued that under the first step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ approach, the victim’s injuries fall under Band 3 of the _Low Song Chye_ sentencing framework (_ie_, six to 24 months’ imprisonment). Specifically, the Prosecution submitted that the appropriate starting sentence should be 12 months’ imprisonment, given the seriousness of the victim’s injuries. Moving on to the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ approach, the Prosecution argued that the kitchen knife was inherently dangerous, thereby warranting an uplift of four months’ imprisonment. Adding this to the starting sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment would raise the total sentence to 16 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution then argued that under the third step, a further uplift of two months should be added, on account of the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     While the victim may have struck the Accused first, the Accused’s response of slashing the victim’s arms and hands repeatedly was wholly disproportionate.

> (b)     The Accused failed to render assistance even when the Accused started to bleed. Instead, he chased the victim. The attack was thus persistent in nature.

> (c)     The Accused effectively perpetrated a group attack as he had three other friends attacking the victim, alongside himself.

The uplift of two months would bring the total imprisonment term to 18 months.

22     The Prosecution further submitted that this imprisonment term cohered with the precedents, which showed a general correlation between the weapon used and the harm caused on the one hand, and the resulting imprisonment term on the other. Specifically, the Prosecution tendered a table setting out the following six precedents:

#### Defence Submissions

23     The Defence contended that the Accused should receive an imprisonment term of only four to six months. It relied on the case _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Firdaus Khan s/o Rahman Khan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 270</span> (“_Muhammad Firdaus Khan_”), where the offender faced (_inter alia_) one charge under s 324 of the Penal Code for attacking his girlfriend with a 31 cm blade. The girlfriend suffered a superficial 2 cm laceration over the scalp, swelling over the occipital region, a minor head injury and concussion. The Defence highlighted that the offender received an imprisonment term of only eight months for the s 324 charge, despite the presence of aggravating factors, including the fact that the offender faced a related charge under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act[^12] for possessing two knives (one of which was that used to attack the girlfriend). The Defence thus argued that the Accused in the present case deserves an even lower imprisonment term of four to six months. [^13]

## Decision

24     I applied the three-step sentencing approach laid out in _Ng Soon Kim_ and imposed an imprisonment term of 15 months on the Accused.

25     In arriving at this decision, I was unable to derive much assistance from the Prosecution’s table of precedents (set out at paragraph 22 above), as these precedents were not accompanied by any reasoned grounds. In any event, they were all decided prior to the sentencing approach laid down in _Ng Soon Kim_.

#### Step 1 – The notional starting sentence had this been a case of voluntarily causing hurt simpliciter

26     Pursuant to the approach laid out in _Ng Soon Kim_, the first step is to determine the notional starting sentence had this been a case of voluntarily causing hurt simpliciter (under s 323 of the Penal Code). To that end, the focus is on the _actual_, rather than the potential harm, caused by the offender’s actions (_Low Song Chye_, at \[79\]).

27     The facts of both _Low Song Chye_ and _Ng Soon Kim_ provide some illustration as regards how the starting sentence should be pegged:

> (a)     In _Low Song Chye_, the victim suffered mild loss of hearing and tinnitus. See J held that this fell within the lower half of Band 2 and, after taking account of the aggravating and mitigating factors, imposed an imprisonment term of two months.

> (b)     In _Ng Soon Kim_, the offender had (pursuant to a road rage incident) sprayed insecticide at the victim’s face, while simultaneously igniting the aerosol stream with a lighter, as the victim sat in his car. This singed the victim’s hair and caused superficial first-degree burns. Menon CJ held that this injury warranted an imprisonment term of two months under the _Low Song Chye_ framework (prior to adjustment for aggravating and mitigating factors).

28     The injuries in both _Low Song Chye_ and _Ng Soon Kim_ were relatively minor, compared to the present case. I agreed with the Prosecution that the injuries caused by the Accused fell within **Band 3** of the _Low Song Chye_ framework. In _Low Song Chye_, See J explained (at \[85\]):

> The third band covers cases in which serious hurt has been caused to the victim. This would generally include serious injuries of a permanent nature, or **_which necessitate significant surgical procedures_**. \[emphasis added\]

In this respect, the surgical procedures which the victim underwent included wound debridement and surgical repair of the ulnar artery and nerve as well as of the extensor tendons.

29     The injuries had lasting impact. At a follow-up medical examination conducted two months after the attack, the victim still had diminished sensation over his right little finger and the radial aspect of his ring finger. A medical report dated 22 March 2019 was consequently unable to rule out the prospect of the victim’s injuries being permanent, noting that the Accused had not recovered full function in his hands. It is of course true that the Accused must be given the benefit of the doubt, in that the prospect of the victim recovering full function in his hands must not be ruled out, short of medical evidence to that effect.[^14] Still, it would be wrong to trivialise the injuries as being merely transient, given that they were serious enough to cost the victim his job and render him financially dependent on social services. The victim had 62 days of hospitalisation leave, the first three weeks of which were marked by an inability to write, eat or work easily. In that respect, the injuries had traversed well into the legal realm of grievous hurt. The Accused was convicted under s 324 (rather than s 326) of the Penal Code only because the Prosecution had reduced the charge.

30     The Defence sought to rely on _Muhammad Firdaus Khan_, where the offender faced (_inter alia_) one charge under s 324 of the Penal Code for attacking his girlfriend with a knife. He was sentenced to only eight months’ imprisonment. Nevertheless, _Muhammad Firdaus Khan_ is clearly distinguishable. The offender in that case did not slash or cut the victim with the knife. Instead, he used the _blunt_ end of the blade to hit the victim’s head.[^15] In the present case, the Accused deployed his blade in a much more lethal fashion, slashing the victim repeatedly to inflict injuries that were serious and extensive. To put things in perspective, the victim’s wounds in the present case generated a trail of blood stretching over several blocks, allowing the police to trace his path all the way back to the coffeeshop.

31     In light of the severity of the injuries, I pegged the starting sentence (under the first step of the approach laid out in _Ng Soon Kim_) at **10-12 months**’ imprisonment. This lies slightly _below_ the one-third mark within _Low Song Chye’s_ Band 3 range (which spanned from six to 24 months).

#### Step 2 – The appropriate uplift to account for the weapon used

32     I now move to the second step of the sentencing approach laid out in _Ng Soon Kim_. This involves factoring in an appropriate uplift to account for the dangerous weapon or means used to inflict the hurt. While the first step of determining the appropriate starting sentence focuses on the _actual_ harm suffered by the victim (as explained at paragraph 26 above), the second step takes on board the _potential_ harm posed by the dangerous weapon or means employed to inflict that harm (see _Ng Soon Kim_, at \[12\]). The more _inherently_ dangerous the weapon or means, the greater the potential harm and the higher the level of egregiousness. In this respect, the following passage from Menon CJ’s judgment in Ng Soon Kim is instructive (at \[11\]):

> Some of these means, such as using an instrument for shooting, or using a weapon likely to cause death, are likely to be inherently more egregious than other means, such as the use of a substance deleterious to the body or by means of an animal, although even in the latter, much will depend on the particular facts. By way of example, if the accused person were to use an animal to inflict harm, the gravity and egregiousness would vary greatly depending on whether, for instance, a king cobra was used as compared to if a small dog was used.

33     In _Ng Soon Kim_, Menon CJ observed that the act of spraying insecticide at the victim while igniting the aerosol stream “would not have been trivial by any means, but neither would it have been at the high end of serious culpability” (at \[15\]). Menon CJ also took account of the enhanced potential harm arising from the flame being directed into the confines of the victim’s car, as the car interior could have caught fire. That risk was further compounded by the fact that the car was in the middle of a busy road intersection (at \[16\]). His Honour thus held that a “substantial uplift” of six months’ imprisonment was warranted, on account of the dangerous means used to inflict the hurt.

34     It is worth noting that when assessing the potential harm from an ignited aerosol stream, the court in _Ng Soon Kim_ took account of how that harm was exacerbated by the interplay with _environmental factors_, e.g. the possibility of fire starting in a car at a busy road intersection. In contrast, it is fair to say that the _inherent_ danger of a kitchen knife is higher, given that it could kill with a single blow to any one of the human body’s vulnerable points, _irrespective_ of environmental factors. As such, if an ignited aerosol stream could attract an uplift of six months’ imprisonment under the second step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ approach, I was of the view that the uplift for a kitchen knife should be the same, if not more. Of course, much would depend on the facts. The uplift may not be as high if the kitchen knife were blunt and incapable of breaking the skin. That was not the case here, as evidenced by the extensive lacerations sustained by the victim. I was thus of the view that the uplift for the kitchen knife in this case should be pegged at **six months**’ imprisonment.

35     Given that that the starting sentence under the first step of the sentencing approach in _Ng Soon Kim_ may extend to two years,[^16] the uplift added under the second step (to account for the dangerous weapon or means used) could _potentially extend to five years_, given that the maximum imprisonment term under s 324 is seven years. In light of the inherent danger posed by a sharp kitchen knife, I did not think that pegging the uplift at the six-month mark within that five-year span was in any way excessive.

36     Adding this uplift of six months to the indicative starting sentence of 10-12 months’ imprisonment (derived under the first step, at paragraph 31 above) yields an overall sentence of **16-18 months**’ imprisonment.

#### Step 3 – Calibrating for aggravating and mitigating circumstances

37     The third step of the sentencing approach under _Ng Soon Kim_ entails adjusting the overall sentence to account for the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case. Under this third step, I reduced the overall sentence of 16-18 months’ imprisonment, as derived under the preceding paragraph, to **15 months**’ imprisonment.

38     I set out below the factors which justify calibrating the sentence _downwards_:

> (a)     In the instant case, the Accused faced repeated and escalating acts of provocation by the victim:

>> (i)       It was the victim who first flipped the table at the coffeeshop and punched the Accused.

>> (ii)       After having left, the victim returned to the coffeeshop armed with an aluminium pole.

>> (iii)       When the Accused walked up the concrete steps to meet the victim, the latter threw a bicycle at the Accused.

>> (iv)       Finally, when both parties were armed and having a verbal altercation, it was (yet again) the victim who struck the first blow - this time with a weapon and to a vulnerable part of the Accused’s body (his face).

> That provocation is a relevant sentencing consideration is seen from the following passage in _Low Song Chye_ (at \[98\]):

>> I am also aware, however, that these acts need to be seen in their proper context. In this case, the victim had also acted in an aggressive manner. Indeed, the victim admitted that she wanted to retaliate against the accused. The CCTV footage also clearly shows that the victim had thrown a pool ball in the accused’s direction. Therefore, while the accused’s actions were certainly disproportionate and unwarranted, there was also an element of provocation by the victim.

> (b)     I also note that the injuries inflicted by the Accused were confined to non-lethal parts of the body (_ie_, the victim’s hands and arms). This is in contrast to the precedents cited by the Prosecution at paragraph 22 above, where the weapon was directed at more vulnerable parts of the body. The attacks in those precedents included stabbing of the abdomen (_eg_, _Ellson Ang_, _Albert Lee_ and _Muhammad Bin Kamarudin Mustaffa_), slashing of the chest wall (_eg_, _Muhammad Zuraidi bin Md Sharif_) and slashing of the forehead (_eg_, _Ubonphan_).

> (c)     The fact that the Accused pleaded guilty also warranted a further sentencing discount. As observed by Menon CJ in _Ng Soon Kim_ (at \[17\]):

>> Even though the evidence against the appellant in this case was largely uncontroverted, I accepted that his timeous plea of guilt saved precious judicial time and resources that would otherwise have been incurred at trial.

I also note that the Accused did not have any violence-related antecedents that would have potentially justified an uplift in sentence.[^17]

39     In calibrating the imprisonment term downwards, I was mindful that the discount should nevertheless be restricted, given the following countervailing considerations:

> (a)     Firstly, the nature of the attack was highly persistent. As See J observed in _Low Song Chye_, continued aggression by the offender after inflicting the injury is a relevant aggravating factor (at \[98\]):

>> I am of the view that the accused’s subsequent acts of aggression, including the second time he grabbed the victim’s neck, can be taken into account. This is because they took place shortly after the offence had been committed, and can properly be seen as part of the same altercation. Further, the accused’s subsequent aggressive behaviour did reflect on the accused’s culpability in so far as it indicated that the offence took place within a longer episode of aggressive behaviour

> In the present case, the victim had, upon suffering profuse bleeding, disengaged from the fight and run away. Yet, the Accused chased after him. I note that the mitigation plea denied that the Accused pursued the victim.9 However, this runs counter to the Statement of Facts (which the Accused admitted to without qualification), which states unequivocally[^18] that the Accused and his two friends _did_ chase the victim even after the latter ran away.

> (b)     Secondly, the attack perpetrated by the Accused was a group attack against a single victim – this is yet another aggravating factor. While the Accused launched his assault, his three friends each took turns to throw plastic chairs at the victim. Even during the subsequent pursuit of the victim, the Accused was joined by two of his friends.

> (c)     Finally, while the Accused’s plea of guilt did save precious judicial time, his attempt at mitigation was marked by a distinct _lack_ of remorse. The mitigation plea averred that when the victim returned to the coffeeshop with an aluminium pole, the Accused rushed out to meet him “in self-defence and self-preservation”.[^19] This was a grotesque mischaracterisation. A person intent on avoiding trouble would have either stayed away from the victim and/or called the authorities for assistance. However, the video evidence showed the Accused striding out to meet the victim, kitchen knife in one hand and broomstick in the other. Those were not the actions of a person acting in defence. The mitigation plea even contended that the Accused had _no intention to injure_ the victim, going so far as to suggest that the Accused inflicted the wounds _accidentally_ while defending himself. This was clearly controverted by the video evidence, which showed the Accused repeatedly slashing at the victim while _advancing_ towards him, even as the victim kept _retreating_. During oral arguments before me, Defence Counsel re-iterated the claim that the Accused had no intention to injure the victim. It was only after I cautioned Defence Counsel that he was straying into the realm of qualifying the plea of guilt that he retracted the claim.

## Conclusion

40     The Accused was thus sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment for the charge under s 324 of the Penal Code.
