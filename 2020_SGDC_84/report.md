Summary Judgment – Conditional Leave to Defend

31 March 2020

### District Judge Constance Tay Woan Fen:

1       This is an appeal against the learned Deputy Registrar’s decision in the Plaintiff’s application for summary judgment. The Plaintiff sought summary judgment against the Defendant for the sum of S$160,500 and interest thereon, amongst others. After hearing Counsel over 2 tranches, the learned Deputy Registrar granted the Defendant conditional leave to defend with costs in the cause with payment of S$160,500.00 to be made by the Defendant. I dismissed the Defendant’s appeal against the learned Deputy Registrar’s order and had provided brief oral reasons for doing so. I now set out my reasons in detail.

## Preliminary procedural point

2       The Notice of Appeal filed by the Defendant merely states that the appeal is against the decision of the learned Deputy Registrar. Appellant’s Counsel clarified during oral submissions at the hearing before me that the Appellant was seeking an Order for unconditional leave to defend. I had pointed out to Appellant’s Counsel that there was no indication in the Notice of Appeal or the Skeletal Submissions that they were seeking to substitute the Deputy Registrar’s order for conditional leave to one for unconditional leave or that the Deputy Registrar’s order for conditional leave ought to be set aside or of any other order they may have wanted to seek by way of this appeal. Be that as it may, I proceeded to hear the appeal.

## The Plaintiff’s case

3       The Plaintiff’s pleaded case is based in restitution. The Plaintiff claims that they agreed to buy and the Defendant agreed to sell 2 units of the Diamagnetic Device CTU-Mega 18 Machine at the price of SGD150,000 per unit and the Defendant issued an Invoice IN070180 dated 26 October 2016 with payment terms in that regard. One of the payment terms was for the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant a 50% deposit and GST thereon for the 2 machines, which the Plaintiff duly paid. The Plaintiff subsequently paid the balance 50% of the purchase price and GST thereon when the Defendant represented to the Plaintiff that the machines were ready to be delivered. The machines were never delivered to the Plaintiff. When the Plaintiff repeatedly demanded for a refund of the monies paid, the Defendant returned a sum of SGD160,500 (equivalent to 50% of the purchase price of the 2 machines and GST thereon). The Defendant has not returned the balance monies paid by the Plaintiff, hence this claim.

## The Defendant’s defence

4       The pleaded defence is that the Plaintiff devised a scheme for the purchase of the 2 machines “in furtherance of a joint venture” between the Plaintiff’s director and the Defendant’s director. The Defendant says they paid the Plaintiff the sum of SGD160,500 on the request of the Plaintiff’s director and issued a credit note for the said amount. The Defendant also says it was taking steps to perform the agreement between the parties for delivery of the machines to the Plaintiff and even if the Defendant was in breach of the agreement, the Plaintiff had elected by conduct to affirm the contract. The Defendant counterclaims against the Plaintiff for repudiatory breach by refusing to accept delivery of either one machine in satisfaction of the Plaintiff’s claim or both machines in discharge of the Defendant’s obligations under the agreement.

## The applicable law

5       The Court of Appeal in the case of _Akfel Commodities Turkey Holding Anonim Sirketi v Townsend, Adam_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 412</span> clarified that the grant of conditional leave to defend should be reserved to cases “where the defendant’s defence has not yet reached the level of showing a reasonable probability of a _bona fide_ defence, a fair case for defence, reasonable grounds for setting up a defence or a fair probability of a _bona fide_ defence.” Where what the defendant has shown does not amount to a fair probability of a _bona fide_ defence, but only that the defence raised is not hopeless, it is warranted for the court to impose conditional leave to defend.

6       I noted that Order 14 rule 1 allows a plaintiff to apply to Court for summary judgment on a “claim included in the writ, or to a particular part of such a claim”. Prayer 1 of the summary judgment application sought judgment “for the sum of S$160,500 together with interest thereon”. Paragraph 3 of the learned Deputy Registrar’s oral reasons at the hearing below confirmed that the Plaintiff withdrew Prayer 2 of the application during the first tranche of the hearing before the Deputy Registrar on 3 September 2019. With respect to the sum of S$160,500, the Plaintiff’s pleaded claim in its Statement of Claim is “Restitution of the said deposit amounting to SGD160,500 under the principles of unjust enrichment”.

7       To my mind, it is arguable whether restitution and payment are perfect alternatives such that a claim in restitution would entitle a successful party to payment of a specific sum (akin to a debt or liquidated claim) without more, such as assessment of damages. The very nature of a claim in restitution lends itself readily to multiple triable issues of fact or law or mixed fact and law, rather than be determined summarily.

8       One of the main planks of the defence is an implied term for time of delivery “within a reasonable time after any and all contractual and regulatory approvals were obtained for the importation and sale of the Diamagnetic Machines in Singapore”. In my view, that in itself would be a critical triable issue – can such a term be implied? How detailed can and should an implied term be?

9       What is also telling to me is that in both the Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim and the show cause affidavit of Ho See Peng filed for the summary judgment application, the Defendant did not address the invoice that was issued by them to the Plaintiff. The Defendant admitted receiving both payments from the Plaintiff and referred to the issue of a credit note in regard to the return of SGD160,500 to the Plaintiff. The Defendant wants the Plaintiff to accept delivery of the machines but has not provided any evidence that the machines are, in fact, ready to be delivered. Instead, throughout its Defence and Counterclaim and the show cause affidavit, the Defendant sought to paint an elaborate and complicated arrangement surrounding the purchase of the machines.

10     The Defendant also submitted that as the Defendant has a subsisting counterclaim, it ought to be allowed unconditional leave to defend. For that proposition, the Defendant relied on _Kim Seng Orchid Pte Ltd v Lim Kah Hin (trading as Yik Zhuan Orchid Garden)_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 34</span>. The High Court recommended a framework on the proper approach to be taken when determining whether summary judgment ought to be ordered where there is a subsisting counterclaim. Step 1 in the recommended framework is for the court to first consider whether the counterclaim is plausible, that is, whether it is reasonably possible for the counterclaim to succeed at trial. The next step is for the court to determine whether the counterclaim that it has found to be plausible amounts to a defence of set-off, whether legal or equitable. If the counterclaim does not amount to a defence of set-off, then the court goes on to consider whether there is a connection between the claim (for which summary judgment is sought) and the counterclaim which it has considered to be plausible. If the court is satisfied of the degree of connection between the claim and counterclaim, then this may provide grounds for the court to stay execution of the whole judgment pending the determination of the connected and plausible counterclaim. The High Court went on to emphasise that the appropriate effect of a connected and plausible counterclaim not amounting to a defence should only be that of a stay of execution pending determination of the counterclaim, rather than that of unconditional leave to defend.

11     On that basis, the Defendant further submitted that there is a reasonable possibility for the counterclaim to succeed at trial and the counterclaim amounts to a defence of set-off. If I am right in applying the framework approach in _Kim Seng Orchid_ in the light of _Akfel_ (where there was no counterclaim involved), I am of the view that the Defendant’s counterclaim for specific performance in that the Plaintiff be ordered to accept delivery of the 2 machines may not succeed at trial and therefore not plausible. It is trite that specific performance of a contract will be ordered only in special circumstances. If a claim is based on a breach of contract, the usual remedy is in damages.

12     Going on to consider the Defendant’s alternative claim for damages in its counterclaim, while it can be said to be a plausible counterclaim, I am not minded to conclude that it amounts to a defence of set-off. In any event, the Defendant made no submission on whether this alternative claim for damages amounted to a set-off. Even if I am satisfied of the connection between the claim and the Defendant’s alternative claim for damages in its counterclaim, the appropriate order I should make is for a stay of execution pending determination of the counterclaim.

13     Here, I am not able to make such a stay order as the Plaintiff has not been granted summary judgment. In the final analysis, I agreed with the learned Deputy Registrar that this is an appropriate case for conditional leave to be granted and dismissed the appeal.

14     I fixed the costs of the appeal at S$2,500 to be paid by the appellant/Defendant to the respondent/Plaintiff.
