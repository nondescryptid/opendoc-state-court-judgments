### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The Accused, Muhammad Is Bin Alias, pleaded guilty to four charges and admitted and consented to four other charges being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing.

2       He was sentenced as follows:

3       Pursuant to section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), in the present case, at least two of the imprisonment sentences had to be ordered to run consecutively. I ordered the sentences for the two offences as shown in the Table in \[2\] to run consecutively. The Accused was thus sentenced to a total imprisonment term of eight years and 19 months, and six strokes of the cane. The Accused was serving sentence for other offences at the time he was sentenced for these current offences. I ordered that the imprisonment term imposed commence with effect from the expiry of the current imprisonment term being served. The Accused appealed against the sentence imposed. The Accused is currently serving sentence.

4       Of the four proceeded charges the Accused faced, two concerned offences of house-breaking (in order to commit theft). The Accused had committed these offences together with one Mohammad Zulkarnai. The Accused was also convicted of an LT-2 charge under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). The other proceeded charge related to an act of mischief, when the Accused cut the GPS Monitoring Tag he was required to wear.

5       Three of the four TIC charges related to property offences. Two of these charges were for two instances of attempted house-breaking (committed together with the said Mohammad Zulkarnai). The other property-related charge that was TIC was a charge of dishonestly misappropriating a bicycle valued at $300 (also committed together with the said Mohammad Zulkarnai).

6       The said Mohammad Zulkarnai also pleaded guilty before me on the same date as the Accused. For the two offences committed together with the Accused, Mohammad Zulkarnai was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment per charge. Mohammad Zulkarnai received shorter sentences for these offences as he was not traced for property antecedents. By contrast, the Accused had several property related antecedents to his name.

7       The Accused and Mohammad Zulkarnai (hereinafter referred to as the “Pair” when relating to the offences they had committed together) had targeted several properties in their house-breaking and attempted house-breaking offences.

8       For the house-breaking offence committed on 13 January 2020, the Pair had broken into a shop-house consisting of a hair salon on the first level and a residence on the second level. The Pair committed this offence at 4.20 am on 13 January 2020. The Accused had used a screwdriver to pry open the rear wooden door of the hair salon for the Pair to illegally gain entry. The Pair had also used their elbows to push open the door.

9       From the hair salon, the Pair stole cash and items totalling $1,950 in value. Of these items stolen, only items totalling $575 were later recovered. The Pair then stole from the residence at the second level. Items totalling $308 in value were stolen. Only one item valued at $8 was later recovered from this part of the theft. The person occupying the residential premises on the second level had been awakened by the Pair’s actions. She opened the door to her bedroom and saw one of the Pair. She shouted in shock, which sent the Pair fleeing from the premises.

10     On the earlier occasion on 10 January 2020, the Pair had chosen a convenience store to break into. In this instance, the Accused had used a screwdriver to pry open the hinge to the padlock which had secured the sliding glass door to the store. This had occurred at about 5.57 am on 10 January 2020. Upon gaining entry, the Accused stole cash and items (including four cartons of cigarettes) amounting to $2,586 in value. On this occasion, Mohammad Zulkarnai had acted as a lookout whilst the Accused committed the actual break-in. Of the items stolen during this episode, only 40 packets of cigarettes were recovered.

11     When the Accused was arrested, urine samples were taken from him. Reports from two analysts from the Health Sciences Authority confirmed that the two samples obtained from the Accused contained Methamphetamine (the street name for which is “Ice”). The Accused admitted that he had smoked Ice a few days before his arrest. Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”), and the Accused is not authorised to consume it.

12     Prior to this offence, the Accused had been convicted, on 5 September 2007, of an LT-1 offence under the MDA and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. He had therefore committed an LT2 offence this time round and was liable for a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. In fact, this offence in 2020 was the second LT-2 offence that the Accused had committed. He had been sentenced on 1 April 2015 to seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for an earlier LT-2 offence.

13     The final proceeded charge faced by the Accused was one of mischief. The Accused had been placed on the Work Release Scheme. He was required to wear a GPS Monitoring Tag. On 2 December 2019, the Accused had cut the said Tag. He was unable to recall where he had disposed the cut Tag.

14     With respect to the sentences to be imposed, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for the Mischief charge. The Tag that the Accused had cut and disposed of was valued at $535. I considered the sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution to be appropriate.

15     As for the LT-2 offence, the Prosecution sought a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The mandatory minimum sentence for this offence was an imprisonment term of seven years and six strokes of the cane. As stated in \[12\] this was the second time the Accused had committed an LT-2 offence. He had been sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence for the earlier LT-2 offence as recently as 1 April 2015. The Prosecution sought an uplift of one year (over the mandatory minimum sentence) for this repeated offence. In _Cheang Geok Lin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 548</span>, it was recognised by the High Court that there “were a number of precedents that suggested that the sentence for a second LT-2 offence should be a term of imprisonment of about eight years”. What the Prosecution was seeking here for the Accused was appropriate.

16     We now turn to the two house-breaking charges faced by the Accused. The Prosecution was seeking a term of 19 months’ imprisonment for each of these two charges. The Prosecution tendered a “Table of Sentencing Precedents” in support of their contention that the Accused ought to be sentenced to 19 months’ imprisonment for each of the two house-breaking charges.

17     I recognised the limitations involved in relying on precedents cited where such precedents involved unreported cases. In four of the six cases in the Prosecution's Table, the persons sentenced had no property-related antecedents, and were sentenced variously to imprisonment terms ranging from eight months to 15 months. Based on the Prosecution’s Table, these four cases all involved stolen items valued at less than $1,000. In the cited case of _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Razali Bin Kamaludi_, the offender there (who was traced but for unrelated offences) was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment, where items valued at $900.65 were stolen. By contrast, the items stolen by the Pair in the present case were valued at $2,258 and $2,586 (for the respective charges).

18     The other two cases in the Prosecution’s Table involved accused persons who were traced for property-related antecedents. In the cited case of _Public Prosecutor v Daud Bin Ali_, the offender there was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment where the items stolen were valued at $4,695. The offender there faced only one charge, and had effected illegal entry by using a discarded wire to unlock the main door, which was secured only by a door knob lock. In the other cited case of _Public Prosecutor v Rino Hardi Bin Rahim_, the offender had illegally gained entry by opening a numeric padlock and unchaining the gate to the premises. Items stolen there were valued at $1,550. The offender there was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment.

19     In the present case, there were several aggravating factors surrounding the two proceeded house-breaking charges faced by the Accused. The offences were committed at 4.20 am (13 January 2020) and 5.57 am (10 January 2020) respectively. In the incident on 13 January 2020, the Accused had used a screwdriver to pry open the rear wooden door to the hair salon. The Pair then used their elbows to push the door open. The premises here consisted of a hair salon and a residence, on separate levels. The Pair had intruded not only upon the commercial premises of the hair salon, but also upon the residence of the victim (who was 61 years old) who had been awakened by the Pair’s actions. She had shouted in shock when she detected one of the Pair.

20     In the incident on 10 January 2020, the Accused himself had carried out the act of breaking in, whilst Mohammad Zulkarnai had acted as a lookout. The Accused had used a screwdriver to pry open the hinge to the padlock which had secured the sliding glass door of the convenience store.

21     As stated in \[17\], the items stolen by the Pair were valued at $2,258 and $2,586 (for the respective charges). Further, as stated in \[9\] and \[10\], there was only partial recovery of all the items stolen by the Pair.

22     The Accused had several property-related antecedents. He had faced (amongst other charges) a criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) charge on 3 March 2006 (which was TIC). On 5 September 2007 he was sentenced for several offences (including the LT-1 offence mentioned in \[12\]). Amongst the sentences meted out on this occasion in 2007 were two sentences of three years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each of two proceeded robbery charges (the imprisonment term for one was ordered to run concurrently) and a six month concurrent term for a theft charge. On 1 April 2015, the Accused was again sentenced for several offences (including the LT-2 offence mentioned in \[12\]). On this occasion, the accused was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for each of three proceeded CBT charges, and another term of six months for a proceeded theft charge. One of the six months term for one of the CBT charges, and the six months term for the theft charge were ordered to run concurrently. On the occasions of 5 September 2007 and 1 April 2015, there were several property-related charges that were TIC. As stated in \[6\], Mohammad Zulkarnai had been sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment for each of the present house-breaking charges. Mohammad Zulkarnai did not have property-related antecedents on his record. The Accused had several. Hence, the Prosecution sought an uplift of four months per house-breaking charge for the Accused (as compared to Mohammad Zulkarnai). It had to be borne in mind as well, that of the four TIC charges faced by the Accused, two involved two separate attempts to commit house-breaking, and one charge relating to dishonest misappropriation. It was therefore appropriate to factor in an uplift to the sentences to be meted out for the two proceeded house-breaking charges. All factors considered, I found that the sentence sought by the Prosecution for the Accused (19 months' imprisonment) in relation to each of the house-breaking charges was therefore appropriate in the circumstances. The mitigation plea of the Accused was unremarkable.

23     The Accused was therefore sentenced to the terms as sought by the Prosecution (see Table at \[2\]). As mentioned in \[3\], the imprisonment sentences of at least two of the four proceeded charges had to be ordered to run consecutively.

24     The Prosecution had urged that the sentences for one of the house-breaking charges and the LT-2 charge be made to run consecutively. I found that this submission was entirely in keeping with the principles guiding sentencing courts.

25     A sentencing court has to be mindful not to infringe the one-transaction rule (_Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>). In this case, it was entirely appropriate to order that the sentence for one of the house-breaking charges run consecutively to the LT-2 sentence. These two offences were distinct in character and nature, and were committed on different dates. Further, this would be in keeping with the direction (_Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span>) that the Accused should be separately punished for such unrelated offences. It was clear that one of the sentences for the house-breaking charges had to run consecutively to reflect the culpability of the Accused with regard to the several property-related charges that he faced, and the level of criminality shown in the present episode. It was also necessary to recognise the need for specific deterrence in this particular case: the Accused had a history of varied property-related offences. Specific deterrence was also an important consideration with regard to the LT-2 offence. The Accused had been sentenced for his earlier LT-2 conviction as recently as 1 April 2015.

26     The sentencing court must, before meting out the sentences to be imposed, take a last look at all circumstances of the case. The court must be satisfied that, in totality, the sentence is appropriate and must not be a crushing or excessive sentence. The records of the Accused indicated that he had been sentenced to a total sentence of eight years’ imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane on 5 September 2007; on 1 April 2015 his total sentence was seven years and 19 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. On these two occasions, the total sentences were made up of consecutive imprisonment terms for drug-related and property-related offences. Upon a final consideration in the present case, the total sentence of eight years and 19 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was therefore appropriate and was not manifestly excessive, in all the circumstances of the case.

27     At the time of conviction and sentencing, the Accused was serving his previous sentence. Section 322(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that “Where a person who is an escaped convict or is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced again to imprisonment, the latter sentence of imprisonment must begin either immediately or at the end of the imprisonment to which he was previously sentenced, as the court awarding the sentence directs.”

28     I directed that the total sentence of eight years and 19 months’ imprisonment take effect from the expiry of the current imprisonment term being served. The current offences committed by the accused were distinct from the earlier offences for which he was serving sentence and did not form part of the same transaction. It was therefore appropriate to order the present sentence to commence only after the expiry of the previous sentence being served.

29     The accused has appealed against sentence and is currently serving sentence.
