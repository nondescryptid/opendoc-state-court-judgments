BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION LAW – contractors’ duties – completion of works

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 48/2021.\]

20 December 2021

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       The present suit was a one day trial on whether the plaintiff had proven on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was liable to pay the plaintiff for firstly, retention monies in the sum of $169,414.24 for construction of retaining wall and E-Deck for a construction project in Singapore. The breakdown of the retention monies was $38,758.47 for the retaining wall and $130,655.77 for the E-Deck. The second sum claimed was $30,000 for the remaining monies due and owing from the retaining wall as a goodwill discount of $543.89 was conceded by the plaintiff to have been granted in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff sought leave and was granted leave by this Court at the commencement of the trial to reflect these amended amounts.

2       At the end of the trial, I found that the plaintiff had not proven its case and dismissed its claim. Being dissatisfied, the plaintiff has since appealed against my decision and these are the full grounds of my decision.

## Facts

### The parties

3       It was undisputed that the parties entered into a contract dated 22 October 2013 for the construction of the retaining wall and E-Deck of a construction project located at 29 Tampines Central 7, Singapore. The plaintiff was tasked with such construction works and therefore sought payment from the defendant upon completion of these works. The sum claimed by the plaintiff totalled $199,414.24 comprising of $169,414.24 for construction of retaining wall and E-Deck and $30,000 for the remaining monies due and owing from the retaining wall.

4       On 11 January 2017, the plaintiff’s Director Mr Liu Sheng Ping (“Mr Liu”) and the defendant’s Managing Director Mr Tng Kay Lim (“Mr Tng”) met to discuss payment of outstanding sums. They agreed on a settlement sum amounting to $299,600 to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff. This sum was reflected in the amended Final Payment Certificates that were subsequently signed by both of them. Pursuant to such agreement, the defendant paid this amount the very next day which was 12 January 2017. On that day, Mr Liu attended personally at the plaintiff’s premises to collect the cheque payment. Both Mr Liu and Mr Tng gave evidence in court as they were clearly relevant witnesses.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

5       The plaintiff’s pleaded case was that as the defendant’s subcontractor, it was engaged to undertake construction of the retaining wall and E-Deck for the project at Tampines Central. As such works had been completed and the defect liability period had since long passed, the plaintiff was therefore claiming the sum of $199,414.24 for work done.

6       According to the plaintiff, after the completion of the works, the defendant’s Quantity Surveyor (“QS”) one Hooi Fang handed over the Final Certificates for the retaining wall and E-Deck to the defendant on or around 26 August 2016. However, Mr Tng did not certify them nor did he address or discuss them with the plaintiff until 11 January 2017 when Mr Tng and Mr Liu met to discuss the amounts payable by the defendant to the plaintiff.

7       Mr Liu alleged that the Final Payment Certificates were printed and not handwritten when he signed on them during the discussion that took place on 11 January 2017. My Liu’s position was that Mr Tng insisted on a goodwill discount for the retaining wall and E-Deck but Mr Liu only agreed to a discount of $543.89 for the retaining wall such that the final figure of $30,000 was still due to the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had made handwritten amendments to the Certificates after the discussion without the plaintiff’s consent.

8       On 12 January 2017, Mr Liu turned up at Mr Tng’s office building to collect cheque payment. He conceded that he saw handwritten amendments on Final Payment Certificate No 22 but he proceeded to sign and endorse all documents as “the sum to be paid was substantial”[^1]. He conceded that “the issues with regard to the two final certificates slipped” his mind until July 217 when the defect liability period for the retaining wall works ended[^2]. Mr Liu claimed that the copies of the amended Payment Certificates were not released to him on a timely basis until 17 May 2018.[^3]

9       The plaintiff claimed that he found serious problems and errors in the Certificates. Firstly, the retention value was covered and replaced by $38,758.47 and the value of the retaining wall works was amended to $346,752.34 which was lower than the value of $356,394.92 certified by the defendant in its Payment Certificate No 7. Mr Liu claimed that there was no discussion nor dispute on the value of the works done and the value of the retention monies as they had only discussed the goodwill discount of $543.89.[^4]

### The defendant’s version

10     The defence as pleaded was straightforward. The plaintiff submitted a payment claim of $30,543.89 for the retaining wall works and on 21 December 2016, the plaintiff submitted a payment claim of $309,176.50 (being $288,949.97 plus 7% GST) for the E-Deck works. At the discussion on 11 January 2017, parties agreed on a full and final payment of $299,600 as payment for the E-Deck works with zero amount remaining for the retaining wall works. The full and final settlement agreements had been captured in the two Final Payment Certificates signed between Mr Liu and Mr Tng at the 11 January 2017 meeting. On 12 January 2017, Mr Liu accepted payment of $299,600. Hence, the plaintiff was estopped from commencing action against the defendant as the matter had been fully settled.

11     According to Mr Tng, at the meeting on 11 January 2017, he proposed to Mr Liu to accept payment of $299,600 for the E-Deck and a full discount for the remaining amount for the retaining wall works. Mr Liu agreed. Hence, Mr Tng proceeded to make the necessary amendments to the Payment Certificates to reflect this agreement.[^5] Mr Liu signed off on the Certificates and copies were given to Mr Liu for his record.[^6]

12     Based on this understanding reached during the meeting, the plaintiff had prepared an invoice dated 11 January 2017 that was consistent with the understanding for the sum of $299,600 for the E-Deck and the defendant also issued a Payment Voucher dated 12 January 2017 to reflect such payment.[^7]

## Issue to be determined

13     The main issue for determination was whether there had been a full and final settlement of the claim pursuant to the meeting of 11 January 2017 between Mr Liu and Mr Tng followed by the defendant’s payment of the sum of $299,600 on 12 January 2017 such that the defendant was not liable to make further payments to the plaintiff.

## Decision of the court

14     I found that the two main documents relied by the parties in the course of the trial were as follows:

> a.     For the claim relating to the retaining wall, the evidence was found in the Final Payment Certificate No. 8 dated 24 August 2016[^8] and Interim Payment Certificate No 7 dated 11 April 2014[^9].

> b.     For the claim relating to the E-Deck, the evidence was found in the Final Payment Certificate No 22 dated 21 December 2016[^10] and Interim Payment Certificate No 21 dated 6 January 2016[^11].

15     The applicable law can be found in the Court of Appeal decision of _Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal_ \[2009\] 2 SLR (R) 332. At \[46\], the Court of Appeal enunciated that for there to be a valid agreement, there must be “an identifiable agreement that is complete and certain, consideration as well as intention to create legal relations.” I found that these elements had been satisfied when the parties entered into the settlement agreement on 11 January 2017 which was followed by payment made by the defendant on 12 January 2017. Therefore, I found that the settlement agreement was valid and parties were bound by the terms of the settlement agreement in that the full and final payment made on 12 January 2017 such that the plaintiff could make no further claims for the sum of $199,414.24 claimed in the present suit.

16     In paragraphs 7 to 9 of the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant did not furnish the original copies of the final certificates despite a series of emails between parties in May 2018. The plaintiff also asserted that the emails did not state that there was a full and final settlement and there was no consideration. I found such assertions to be unmeritorious.

17     I found that Mr Liu and Mr Tng had agreed at the 11 January 2017 meeting that the sum of $299,600 which was paid on 12 January 2017 included all the sums claimed by the plaintiff in this suit. It was clear that when the meeting was convened between parties, it was intended between parties to create legal intentions as evidenced from the discussion about moneys owing. This meant that there were no retention monies of $169,414.24 payable at all for the retaining wall and e-Deck by the defendant.

18     Mr Liu agreed at cross-examination that he did sign the Final Payment Certificates at BA 89 and 91. Mr Liu claimed that Mr Tng or his staff changed the amounts and were not in line with the agreement Mr Liu had with the QS. Mr Liu exhibited at BA 106 his contemporaneous email sent on 25 May 2018 to Mr Tng entitled “Sintrust Final Claim for EC Retaining wall contract” wherein he claimed that Mr Tng edited the payment certificate after they had both signed. I found this to be a bare assertion as there was no proof of such alterations as claimed. And as rightly pointed by the defendant’s counsel at cross-examination, the plaintiff did not file a notice of objection as to the authenticity of the certificates after original copies of the certificates were viewed by the plaintiff’s counsel and the plaintiff as part of discovery on 4 November 2020.

19     I found that both Final Payment Certificates had a clear statement to the effect that the defendant had confirmed and accepted the final account statement and there shall be no further claims and/or outstanding invoice from both parties. Hence, the agreement was complete and certain.

20     During the trial, I found Mr Tng to be a truthful witness and accepted his version of what transpired at the 11 January 2017 meeting. I accepted the pleaded case of the defendant that the agreement between parties was for $299,600 to be paid in full and final settlement of all dues relating to the E-Deck and zero sum payable for the retaining wall works. This had been supported by an examination of the two Final Payment Certificates.

21     Mr Tng had testified that the figures of retention sum of $38,758.47 for the retaining wall and $130,655.77 for the E-Deck for the final payment certificates were not written by him but by his staff. I agreed with Mr Tng that the meeting had focused on full and final settlement sums and retention monies that were reflected in brackets in both final payment certificates were not intended to be retained. This was because in the final payment certificate for the retaining wall, line 10) clearly stated that “Amount Due” was a “ – “ which meant that no amount was due at all. In addition, Mr Liu had signed next to the line 10) indicating that he agreed to accept that there are no amounts due for the retaining wall.

22     For the Final Payment Certificate for the E-Deck, there was a “-“ next to the line 5 for retention sum and a final figure of $299,600 was shown in the final line. So $299,600 was the final amount payable for the E-Deck and this was actually paid the next day.

23     Although Mr Liu had made the commercial decision to accept $299,600 as full and final payment for all sums due for the retaining wall and E-Deck works, he chose to subsequently still pursue $30,000 as balance sum payable for the retaining wall works. Mr Liu claimed that he had been consistent about his unhappiness in not being paid $30,000 for the retaining wall works. According to Mr Liu at \[29\] of his AEIC, on 12 January 2017, when he went to the defendant’s office to collect payment for the $299,600, he complained to the defendant’s staff about not receiving the cheque for retaining wall. He further pointed to the invoice he had prepared dated 11 January 2017[^12] which showed that the $299,600 was stated as a “progress payment” for the E-Deck.

24     According to the plaintiff, he did not pursue payment for the E-Deck and retaining wall works for about 6 months from 12 January 2017 till July 2017 as he had “so many project issues to settle every day” and the “issues with regard to the two final certificates slipped” his mind. Even then, he only chased Li Ping, an employee of the defendant, in July 2017 to prepare retention release payment certificate. It took Mr Liu up to May 2018 before he actually confronted Mr Tng about the allegedly outstanding payments.

25     I found the plaintiff’s explanation as to why he did not actively pursue the allegedly outstanding payment of $199,414.24 for 1 year and 5 months to be incredible. This amount of $199,414.24 was no small sum in view of Mr Liu’s email of 25 May 2018[^13] sent to Li Ping which was copied to Mr Tng. In that email, Mr Liu had described his own company as “small” and “poor”. I found that the plaintiff did not actively pursue this amount because he knew there was a full and final payment made on 12 January 2017 but he had regretted making the settlement agreement.

26     After the settlement discussion between parties, Mr Liu had prepared the invoice for the E-Deck for $299,600[^14]. It was stated in the invoice as “progress payment” for the E-Deck. However, Mr Liu agreed during cross-examination that as at date of the invoice dated 11 January 2017, all works had been completed on site. Further, I noted that the Payment Voucher issued by the defendant on 12 January 2017 [^15] stated “Supply Labour to construct the E-Deck” and did not mention that it was progress payment. Mr Liu conceded that he had signed on the Payment Voucher. If Mr Liu had intended for the sum of $299,600 to be a progress payment, he did not pen down any reservation of his right to pursue further payment given that all works had been completed by then and there would be no more payments due. Therefore, I found that this invoice was for final payment instead and not progress payment as alleged by Mr Liu.

27     Finally, as for the claim by the plaintiff that the agreement lacked consideration, I agreed with paragraph 22 of the defendant’s closing submissions that there was consideration in that the defendant paid the retention moneys ahead before expiration of the defect liability period by relying on the promise by the plaintiff to accept $299,600 as full and final settlement of all claims.

## Conclusion

28     For the above reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. After hearing parties on their submissions relating to costs and disbursements, I fixed the costs and disbursements accordingly to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff.
