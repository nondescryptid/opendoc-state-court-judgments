3       The Accused was sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 3 years.

## Newton Hearing

4       The Accused disputed that he was the “headman” of ‘Pak Hai Tong’ Triad Society of the ‘Ji it’ Group as stated in the Statement of Facts (the “SOF”). As the role of the Accused in a triad society had a bearing on sentence, a Newton hearing was held. After the evidence of the only witness for the Prosecution had given evidence and cross-examined, the Accused admitted that he was the “headman” as stated in the SOF. The Newton hearing was then discontinued.

5       During the Newton hearing, the statement of the Accused was admitted into evidence (exhibit P1). The Accused had clearly stated that he was the “headman” of the ‘Pak Hai Tong’ Triad Society of the ‘Ji It’ Group since 2013. Prior to that he was a “fighter” from the same gang since 2009.

6       Counsel claimed that had she been given exhibit P1 she would have advised her client to admit it. On the other hand, the learned DPP asserted that she did show the relevant portion of exhibit P1 to counsel some time ago. As this allegation came from the Bar, I was not able to determine which version was the truth.

## Statement of Facts

7       The Accused admitted to the following facts stated in the SOF produced below:

On 21 December 2018 at about 12.17 a.m., the informant reported to the Police Operations Command Centre (POCC) of a case of “J ERT came across man with parang”. The incident location was given as Blk 221A Boon Lay Place Market, Singapore (“the Market”).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Facts pertaining to the arrest</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8. On 21 December 2018 at about 12.17 a.m., the informant who was on patrol duty had responded to an incident of a fight occurring in the vicinity of the Market after being alerted by members of public.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9. Upon arrival at the scene, the informant spotted several members of the Group accosting Syafiq, with one of them holding a black rod and another holding a watermelon knife. The informant immediately drew his revolver and commanded the accused persons to drop their weapons. Following which, all the accused persons split up and fled from the scene.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10. Jurong Division Ground Response Force (GRF) officers subsequently managed to locate Chun Yi and Shengwei, who were inside an SBS bus along Boon Lay Avenue, and they were placed under arrest.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Facts pertaining to the offence</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11. Investigations revealed that on 19 December 2018 at about 11.00 p.m., at the coffeeshop located at No.90 Boon Lay Place, Singapore, B1 to B8 had assaulted Syamie due to a staring incident. Patrick had perceived Syamie to have been staring at him and incited the other co-accused persons to confront Syamie. In the course of the assault, Syamie attempted to run away from B1 to B8, but was tackled to the ground by Shengwei and further assaulted by them while on the ground. B1 to B8 then left Syamie there and rode away on their e-scooters.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12. After being assaulted, Syamie did not seek any medical treatment for his injuries and returned home. At home, Syamie related his assault to Syafiq and Danial. Danial, who realized that one of the assailants was Terry, was furious over the group assault on Syamie and planned to confront Terry and his gang members the following day.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13. On 20 December 2018 at about 10.30 p.m., while together with Hakim, Danial called Terry on the phone, asking why Syamie had been assaulted. During the phone call, Patrick took the phone from Terry and challenged Danial to a fight at the Market.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14. After the phone call, Patrick, who was at the coffeeshop at Boon Lay Shopping Centre with the rest of the Group except Chun Wei, told all of them to standby in readiness for the impending fight. All of them agreed to do so, and then walked to the Market to standby for the fight.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15. At that time, Chun Wei was at home. After being informed by Patrick that a confrontation was pending, Chun Wei left his house and went to the Market, where he joined the other members of the Group.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16. While standing by for the fight, the Group discussed arming themselves with weapons for the fight. Patrick and Chuan Wei armed themselves with a black metal rod (measuring approximately 50 cm in length) and a watermelon knife (with blade measuring approximately 34 cm in length) respectively. Chuan Wei warned the other members of the Group not to stand too near to him when he was using the watermelon knife, or they might get hurt.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17. On 21 December 2018 at about 12.00 a.m., Danial and Hakim arrived at the Market. Shortly after and thereat, they were accosted by the Group. During the confrontation, Danial demanded to know the Group’s reason for assaulting Syamie. Patrick gave Danial two options: first was to leave the Market, or second, to be beaten up by the Group.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18. Danial insisted that he would remain at the Market for Syamie to arrive and to identify his assailants, and then called Syamie and told him to come to the Market immediately to identify his assailants and for an eventual fight.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">19. At their home, Syamie related Danial’s encounter at the Market to Syafiq. Fearing that Danial would be outnumbered for the fight, Syafiq and Syamie decided to support Danial at the Market for the fight. They decided to bring along two metal poles to arm themselves for the fight, and wrapped these metal poles with newspapers. Thereafter, Syamie carried the metal poles in a plastic bag and they both proceeded to the Market.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20. While Danial was waiting for Syamie, he was confronted by one member of the Group who told Danial to leave the Market. When Danial refused, he was punched on his left face. Having seen the assault on Danial and fearing for his safety, Hakim ran away from the Market.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">21. At about 12.15 a.m., Syafiq and Syamie arrived at the Market and met up with Danial. Syafiq took the two metal poles from Syamie and approached Chun Wei, demanding to know the identity of the Group and the reason why the Group had assaulted Syamie.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22. Seeing Syafiq standing chest-to-chest with Chun Wei, Shengwei went forward and pushed Syafiq away, causing Syafiq to fall onto the ground. Danial ran forward and punched Shengwei in the face.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">23. Thereafter, in pursuance of the common object of the Group to voluntarily cause hurt to Syafiq, Syamie, and Danial with a dangerous weapon, the Group started to attack Syafiq, Syamie, and Danial by punching and kicking them. Patrick and Chuan Wei also used their respective weapons (as referred to at [16] above) to attack Syafiq, Syamie, and Danial. Chuan Wei used the watermelon knife and slashed Syafiq multiple times on his hands and body. Patrick used the black metal rod to hit Syafiq. Syafiq used his metal poles in defence against the Group by swinging them in the Group’s direction.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24. While he was being slashed by Chuan Wei, Syafiq shouted for Syamie and Danial to run. Seeing that Syafiq was being outnumbered in the assault, Syamie and Daniel ran away.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25. While Syafiq was on the ground during the attack, Patrick, who was armed with the black metal rod, and Jun Wei decided to confront Syafiq. At this moment, the complainant arrived at scene and raised his revolver in Patrick and Jun Weis’ direction, stopping the attack on Syafiq.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">26. Seeing that the police had arrived at the scene, Chuan Wei hid his watermelon knife under a tree and escaped from the scene. Chuan Wei’s act of hiding the knife was captured by an incar camera belonging to Logeswaran, who was driving past the incident location. The rest of the Group also split up and ran away from the scene.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">27. The watermelon knife and the black metal rod were recovered at the scene. Photographs of the watermelon knife and the black metal rod are appended at Annex A.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28. Chun Yi and Shengwei was eventually located inside a SBS bus along Boon Lay Avenue by the Jurong Division Ground Response Force (GRF) officers, and were arrested.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">29. Patrick and Jun Wei decided to escape to Malaysia and left Singapore for Johor Bahru via Woodlands Checkpoint at about 6.00 a.m. They eventually returned to Singapore a few days later as they ran out of money in Malaysia, and were arrested upon their return.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30. The rest of the Group, excluding Chuan Wei who is still at large, were eventually traced and arrested.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Medical reports</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">31. Syafiq was conveyed to the National University Hospital, Singapore (“NUH”) from the scene. A medical report dated 3 January 2019 by Dr Tay Kon Voi, a Registrar with the Trauma Division, General Surgery Department of NUH, stated that Syafiq sustained the following injuries:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">a. Scalp laceration with outer skull fracture;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">b. Right shoulder laceration;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">c. Left arm laceration;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">d. Left hand laceration; and</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">e. Abrasions over bilateral knees and back.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">32. Syafiq was admitted to NUH for 2 days from 21 to 22 December 2018, where he underwent toilet and suture of his lacerations with repair of hand tendons, and dressing for his abrasions. He was given a total of 18 days’ hospitalization leave.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">33. Syamie and Danial did not seek any medical attention as they did not sustain any visible injuries.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">34. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused Chun Wei was a member of an unlawful assembly with the other co-accused persons, whose common object was to voluntarily cause hurt to Syafiq, Syamie, and Danial, and in prosecution of this common object of the said assembly, one or more of them did use violence and were armed with deadly weapons. He has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 148 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">35. The other co-accused persons, save for Chuan Wei who is still at large, have been dealt with separately:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">a. On 19 August 2019, Chun Yi pleaded guilty to his role in the offence;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">b. On 11 October 2019, Terry pleaded guilty to his role in the offence; and</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">c. On 18 October 2019, Shengwei, Patrick, Jun Wei, Jin Xiang, Jia Long and Jun Tat pleaded guilty to their roles in the offence.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36. Chun Yi, Shengwei, Jin Xiang and Jun Tat were subsequently placed on probation. Patrick, Jun Wei and Terry were ordered to undergo reformative training.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC-913525-2019</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">37. Investigations revealed that since 28 February 2014 to 2 January 2019, in Singapore, the accused Chun Wei was a member bearing the role of ‘Headman’ of the ‘Pak Hai Tong’ Triad Society of the ‘Ji It’ Group operating at Block 175 Boon Lay Drive, Singapore. The accused remained a member of the said group for a continuous period to the date of his arrest.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">38. Investigations further revealed that sometime in November 2018, Chun Wei accepted some of the other accused persons, including Jun Wei, Patrick, Shengwei, Terry, Chun Yi and Jin Xiang, under his leadership as ‘Headman’. There were other members of the accused’s gang whose names he did not know, and whom he recognised only by sight. Chun Wei did not have to brief these gang members of the gang rules as most of them were already affliated gang members. The gang would normally hang around Boon Lay Market and its vicinities.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">39. The ‘Pak Hai Tong’ Triad Society is not a registered society in Singapore under the Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Societies Act”), and is thus an unlawful society.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">40. By virtue of the foregoing, Chun Wei has committed an offence punishable under section 14(3) of the Societies Act.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

## TIC Charges

8       Two other charges were admitted and consented by the Accused for the purposes of sentencing. One of these 2 charges was in respect of a section 147 offence that took place on the 19 December 2019 (DAC900143/2019) which involved substantially the same group of people. The other charge was for being a member of an unlawful society from the period 2009 to 27 February 2014.

## Antecedents

9       The Accused was sentenced to undergo probation in 2012 for the being a member of an unlawful assembly, an offence under section 143 of the Penal Code.

## Mitigation

10     Counsel tendered 2 written mitigation. In the first written mitigation dated 25 March 2020, counsel submitted for a short custodial sentence considering the Accused’s family and personal circumstances.

11     In the latest mitigation dated 28 August 2020, the Accused’s personal circumstances and family situation were highlighted again. With respect, I did not find the circumstances to be so exceptional. Accordingly, I did not think it had any mitigating value.

12     The Accused was diagnosed to have depression and chronic insomnia. See letter dated 8 October 2019 from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.

13     Counsel submitted for a probation report to be called.

## Submissions on Sentence

14     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment. In respect of the section 148 charge, the learned DPP asked for a jail term of at least 3 years’ imprisonment. As for the other charge, the Prosecution submitted for an imprisonment term of 3 months. Both the sentences were to run concurrently.

15     The Prosecution also highlighted that the Accused had not shown remorse as he chose to have a Newton hearing.

16     The learned DPP highlighted that the Accused was the headman of the group. He ought to have exercised control but chose not to deescalate the situation or stop his members from committing the offence. The Accused was also one of the oldest in the group.

## Sentencing Considerations

17     The punishment prescribed for section 148 offence was a mandatory jail term up to 10 years and liable to caning. For the offence under the Societies Act, it was punishable with fine up to $5,000 or imprisoned up to 3 years or both.

18     Given the nature and severity of the offences committed, I was of the view that the main sentencing consideration must be one of deterrence.

19     Next, I considered the mitigating factors. I considered favourably the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty.

20     The Prosecution contended that by having a Newton hearing, the Accused had not shown remorse and accountability for his role in the commission of the offence. I was of the view that as there was an issue as to whether exhibit P1 was indeed disclosed to the Accused before the Newton hearing, the Accused should be given the benefit of doubt.

21     As to the Accused’s medical conditions, there was no evidence to show that it had a causal link to his offending behaviour. Accordingly, I gave no weight to this factor.

## Aggravating Factors

22     As indicated by the Prosecution, the Accused did not wield any weapon during the fight. Nevertheless, I agreed that his culpability was on the high side. As the headman and one of the oldest of the group, he ought to have controlled the situation and not allowed the offence to be committed. I also noted that in this case, the Accused and members of his group were Chinese while the victims were Malays.

23     In determining the sentence, I noted that the Accused had admitted to 2 other similar offences for the purpose of sentencing.

24     Next, the incident took place in the vicinity of the market which prompted members of the public to alert the Police. The situation was very tense. The victim was accosted by the group, with one of them holding a rod and another a watermelon knife. It necessitated the police officer to draw his revolver to stop the altercation. Clearly there was public fear and alarm. It also demonstrated the brazenness of the Accused and his blatant disregard for law and order.

25     I noted the victims in this case were relatively young. One of them, Syafiq, sustained multiple lacerations and a fracture of the outer skull. See \[31\] of the SOF. He was hospitalized for 2 days and given 18 days’ hospitalization leave.

26     Next, I noted there were 10 offenders involved in the rioting. The SOF also disclosed there was premeditation. See \[14\] and \[16\] of the SOF.

## Whether probation was appropriate

27     Given the circumstances and the gravity of the offences committed, I was of the view that probation was not appropriate. There were no exceptional circumstances to warrant the call for a probation report. The Accused was not a youthful offender. Moreover, it appeared that the last probation had no beneficial effect on the Accused. In my view, clearly deterrence must triumph over rehabilitation.

## Sentencing Precedents

28     The Prosecution referred to various sentencing precedents. They were unreported cases except for the case of _Md Anverdeen Basheer Ahmed & 5 ors_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 233</span> and _Muhammad Azlan bin Shaman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 2</span>. In the former case, it involved 2 groups of about 10 people fighting with knives at a pub. The fight arose as a result of a dispute with the pub owner. Minor injuries were suffered by all parties. The High Court sentenced the offender to 36 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for an offence under section 148 of the penal Code. The latter case involved a group of people that fought at a coffee shop. The offender was armed with a samurai sword. The victim’s arm and finger were slashed but there were no permanent injuries. The offender had unrelated antecedent. He was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

29     The cases cited by the Prosecution showed that the sentence meted out for section 148 offence ranged from 30 months’ imprisonment to 4.5 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

30     Ultimately, the sentence must be determined in the light of the facts and circumstances of the case. In my view, the sentence meted out for the section 148 offence in the present case was not far off from the precedents cited by the Prosecution.

31     The Prosecution also tendered several unreported cases in support of their submission for sentence in respect of offence under section 14(3) of the Societies Act. The sentence ranged from 2 to 5 months’ imprisonment. I also noted that in _PP v Zackeer Abbass Khan and Anwer Ambiya bin Kadir Maideen_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 138</span> at \[146\], it was held that the sentencing benchmark for a senior member of a secret society of fighter rank was at least 3 months’ imprisonment term. In that case, the sentence imposed on the offender _Anwer_ was a jail term of 3 months’ imprisonment. This was upheld by the High Court on appeal. See MA 9419/2020. In the present case, the Accused was the headman. Hence, a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

## Conclusion

32     Considering all the circumstances, I sentenced the Accused to 3 years’ imprisonment in respect of DAC 900142/2019 and 3 months’ imprisonment for DAC 913525/2019. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
