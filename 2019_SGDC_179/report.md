### District Judge Sarah Tan:

1       The Accused, Rozkyazmie Bin Rozli, faced a single charge:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">are charged that you, on or about 29 August 2013, in Singapore, did engage in a conspiracy with Sollihin Bin Anhar and persons unknown to cheat Aviva Limited, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 30 August 2013, to wit, you lodged an Accident Statement to deceive Aviva Limited into believing that the vehicle with the registration number SGV9240R (registered under the name of Rozli Bin Jantan) and purportedly driven by you on 30 August 2013 was involved in a genuine accident on 30 August 2013 at about 8.45am with motor vehicles SFY9750Y and YL2824S along Adam Road, when you knew such a purported accident never took place, and thereby dishonestly induce Aviva Limited to pay a claim made by MasterMotors Pte Ltd on your behalf for property damage to SGV9240R for the sum of $10,964.50, which offence was not committed in consequence of this abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 read with Section 116 of the Penal Code Chapter 224.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

2       The Accused claimed trial.

3       After the end of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him.

4       I sentenced him to 6 months’ imprisonment.

5       The Accused has now appealed against his conviction and sentence.

## FINDINGS AT TRIAL

6       For the Accused to be found guilty of the charge, various issues have to be examined / determined:

> (a)     What was stated in the Accused’s Accident Statement?

> (b)     Did the Accused write on and sign the Accused’s Accident Statement?

> (c)     Falsity: Was the alleged accident stated in the Accused’s Accident Statement genuine?

> (d)     Was there a conspiracy with Sollihin Bin Anhar (“Sollihin”) and persons unknown?

7       I will now proceed to elaborate on my findings.

8       For ease of reference, I will use the following terms:

> (a)     SGV9240R: “the Accused’s Car”;

> (b)     SFY9750Y: “Masliana’s Car”; and

> (c)     YL2824S: “Juraimi’s Lorry”.

## (A)    ALLEGED PREJUDICE CAUSED BY THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER

9       Right at the outset of this Grounds of Decision, I will deal with the alleged prejudice caused by the former Investigation Officer Jazzmine Ng: the Defence Counsel alleged that she ought to have been more thorough and retrieved more evidence, such as traffic camera footage along Adam Road and cashcard records.

10     At the end of the day, the evidence before me was what I had to consider in coming to a determination. I was not in a position to speculate what could or could not have been obtained, and what such evidence could or could not have shown.

## (B)    WHAT WAS STATED IN THE ACCUSED’S ACCIDENT STATEMENT?

11     The first prosecution witness, Mr Chua Ming Tsuan Albert, was a claims manager at Aviva Ltd, heading a team of claim handlers to actually assess complex claims and having the authority to process up to a higher limit.

12     Mr Albert Chua had filed a police report dated 31 March 2014 [^1] on suspicion of fraudulent activity involved an accident dated 30 August 2013 along Adam Road (“Alleged Accident”). The 2nd vehicle in the Alleged Accident, Masliana’s Car, was insured by Aviva Ltd. Aviva Ltd had received a claim in respect of the Accused’ Car for $10,964.50 in respect of the Alleged Accident.

13     The suspicions arose due to various factors, for example, their insured driver, Masliana binte Osman (“Masliana”) had been involved in multiple accident records, and photos did not show corresponding damage between the vehicles.

14     In cross-examination, Mr Albert Chua elaborated that he would have looked at the damage pattern, height, the angle of damage. He found the heavier dent on the Accused’s Car, usually the point of impact, closer to the car plate itself. He then compared this to the damage sustained by his insured vehicle, which was quite low and the damage was actually at the bumper and closer to the middle to lower bumper. He was prompted to pursue further investigation.

15     In Exhibit P3, an account of the Alleged Accident was given by the Accused.

16     The salient points of the Accused’s account are that on 30 August at 9 am, the Accused’s Car was hit from the rear by Masliana’s Car. Another vehicle was involved in the Alleged Accident, Juraimi’s Lorry, which was behind Masliana’s Car.

## (C)    DID THE ACCUSED WRITE ON AND SIGN THE ACCUSED’S ACCIDENT STATEMENT?

## (I)    HANDWRITING ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON: “PROBABLE”

17     The Accused asserted that he did not write the handwritten words on the 4th page of Exhibit P3, which appeared below the words “Describe circumstances of the accident”. [^2]

18     He also said that he did not draw the sketch plan. [^3]

19     The Case for the Defence stated: “To the best of our client’s knowledge and recollection, he did not sign the signature that appears on the sketch plan above the line marked ‘Driver’s signature’”.

20     Investigation Officer Kumarasamy testified that he submitted various documents to the Health Sciences Authority for analysis: the Accused’s Accident Statement, the statement of the Accused, and also the 4th page of his cautioned statement.

21     Ms Nellie Cheng, a Senior Forensic Scientist with the Health Sciences Authority, was tasked with examining 2 exhibits, CADRBR/01 and CADRBR/02:

> (a)     To determine if the writer of the specimen signatories in CADRBR/02 could have written the question signature against the driver’s signature (if the driver is not the policyholder) in CADRBR/01; and

> (b)     To determine if the writer of the specimen handwriting in CADRBR/02 could have written the question handwriting in CADRBR/01 with the exceptions of words such as “TP Claim”, “AXA” as highlighted in her report. [^4]

22     Ms Nellie Cheng clarified during cross-examination that she did not examine any words against the sketch plan; she examined the description which appeared below the words “describe circumstances” of the accident. [^5]

23     Ms Nellie Cheng was of the opinion that “it is probable that the writer of the specimen signatures in CADRBR/02 wrote the question signature against the driver’s signature in CADRBR/01”. [^6]

24     A scale of 1 to 8 was used: “for the 1st level it will be…it is the writer and for the 8th level it will be, is not the writer”. [^7] In the present case, having followed their examination protocol and studied the range of variation and characteristic features etc, Ms Nellie Cheng had assessed it to be of the 3rd level of their conclusion levels. [^8]

25     I noted that this assessment of the 3rd level of the conclusion levels was closer to the positive end of the scale.

26     I noted that the Accused did not call his own handwriting expert. Instead, the Defence Counsel raised his own observations and making suggestions to counter Ms Nellie Cheng’s findings, such as:

> (a)     “wouldn’t that be how most people would write R anyway?”; [^9]

> (b)     “Now, would you agree that the---D, as written in the specimen signatures…is generally for the---the round loop---in the D---is generally rounder and bigger as compared to the question handwriting’s Ds”; [^10] and

> (c)     “I’m suggesting to you---Ms Cheng---that this feature of---writing the G---with the loop and then with---the line---to form---an angle---is a common way of writing the letter G”. [^11]

27     The Health Sciences Authority report had stated that it was probably the Accused who had written the details of the accident in Exhibit P3. I found that the Defence had not successfully rebutted that finding.

28     In any event, after taking a look at page 9 of Exhibit P2 and page 4 of Exhibit P3, the Accused said that the signatures of his father and himself seemed the same. [^12]

29     The Accused also tried to argue that the details of Juraimi’s Lorry were not filled in by him, but in any event he did confirm that a lorry was involved. [^13] In fact, in the Accused’s Accident Statement, the full name of Juraimi bin Rajab (“Juraimi”) was explicitly spelt out. [^14]

30     Further, in Exhibit P18, the Accused admitted that he had written the report of the Alleged Accident.

## (II)    WHAT WAS IN THE ACCUSED’S ACCIDENT STATEMENT WAS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH HIS ACCOUNTS ELSEWHERE

31     The Accused’s verbal account of the Alleged Accident in Court also largely accorded with what was described in the Accused’s Accident Statement.

32     The Accused confirmed that his accident involved 3 vehicles:

> “Q:Now, insofar as your evidence is concerned, you were involved in a 3-vehicle collision, yours was the 1st car, there was a 2nd car involved behind you and there was a 3rd lorry behind you. Now, these details would be consistent with the description in page 4 of P3, agree?

> A:Yes.

> Q:It’s also your only accident ever?

> A:Yes, accident for driving a car. [^15]

> Q:What did you see behind you? How many vehicles were involved in the collision?

> A:Many cars stopped, Your Honour, but what I knew that he collided into me and there as a lorry behind.

> Q:So how many cars were involved in the collision?

> A:Three, Your Honour.” [^16]

33     The Accused also conceded as follows:

> “Q:…And your answer…my question is do you agree that the answer you gave in your statement is consistent with your evidence?

> A:No.

> Q:Why?

> A:Because I did not write.

> Q:That’s not the question, Mr Azmie. The question is, is your answer recorded in your statement consistent with your evidence, yes or no?

> A:Yes” [^17]

34     Even in the Defence submissions—Close of Defence Case dated 22 February 2019 at page 34, paragraph E, the Defence wrote that the Accused’s factual accounts “of how the accident occurred is not inconsistent with the written account that appears on 4th page of P3”, save that he did not furnish the licence plate number of the 3rd vehicle.

35     I found that the Accused had written the account of the Alleged Accident set out at page 4 of Exhibit P3 (which largely mirrored his oral testimony in court) and / or had signed against it.

## (D)    FALSITY: WAS THE ALLEGED ACCIDENT STATED IN THE ACCUSED’S ACCIDENT STATEMENT GENUINE?

## (I)    THE OTHER “DRIVERS” AND “PASSENGERS” DISCLOSED IN THE STATEMENTS DENY THE ALLEGED ACCIDENT

36     Mr Albert Chua had confirmed that there were a total of 3 accident reports lodged in relation to this alleged accident. [^18]

37     In Exhibit P4, Masliana Binte Osman had given her account of an accident.

38     Masliana stated that she was the driver of a Mazda and on 30 August 2013 at 8.45 am, along Adam Road, the Accused’s Car had braked in front of her. She stepped on her brake, then Juraimi’s Lorry which was behind her collided into her car and the impact pushed her forward and hit the Accused’s Car.

39     In Exhibit P5, Juraimi Bin Rajab had given his account of an accident.

40     He stated that on 30 August 2013 at 8.45 am, along Adam Road towards PIE, Masliana’s Car in front of him braked, he hit it, and the Accused’s Car was in front of Masliana’s Car.

41     Reading the Accused’s account, as well as Masliana’s and Juraimi’s accounts side-by-side and going by the details of the 3 accounts, **they surely must be describing the same accident:**

> (a)     The same 3 vehicle licence numbers were mentioned in their respective accounts;

> (b)     The date, time and location of their accident tallied; and

> (c)     The descriptions of how their accident occurred tallied.

42     Indeed, there was no other evidence before the Court of any other accident reported to have happened on that day, at that time, along that road, involving all or any of the 3 vehicles. In particular, there was no other accident report of another vehicle or driver or passenger, stating that it was involved in an accident with the Accused’s Vehicle on that day and time at that location.

43     Investigation Officer Kumarasamy testified as follows:

> “Q:Alright. Now, to go back to an earlier area, so, now, apart from the 3 Singapore Accident Statements before this Court, did you discover any other SAS filed for an accident involving SGV9240R that took place on 30 August 2013?

> A:No, Your Honour

> Q:One moment, Your Honour. Right, did---did you conduct a screening to see whether SGV9240R was involved in any accident on 300 August 2013 may---part from the accident reported in the Singapore Accident Statements?

> A:Yes, Your Honour. We did the screening with, uh, the Merimen system and, uh, we found no other accident, Your Honour.” [^19]

44     In Court, Masliana and Juraimi both confirmed that what they had stated in their accident reports were not true. The accident on 30 August 2013 described by them never took place.

45     Rahmat bin Mohd (“Rahmat”) also gave evidence as follows:

> “Q:Now, is the accident as reported in the Singapore Accident Statement in P4 and P5 genuine?

> A:No.

> Q:And how do you know this?

> A:I staged the accident. I did the damages.

> Q:Whose idea was it to stage the accident?

> A:Sollihin.

> Q:And why was there a need to stage the accident?

> A:For fraudulent claim. For the workshop to get money. It is between Sollihin and the workshop.”

46     Interestingly, out of the 3 account-givers of the Alleged Accident, 2 of them, with the exception of the Accused, have admitted that the accident on 30 August 2013 was not genuine.

47     It was clear from Masliana’s evidence that she was standing in and masquerading at the driver for Masliana’s Car purportedly for an accident that did not even take place:

> “Q:So, Ms Masliana, do you know if this accident was real or not?

> …

> A:It’s not because if it’s a real or genuine accident, I don’t think so, Sollihin will call and ask me to be the driver.” [^20]

> “Q:Yes, and what happened after you saw this report, exhibit P4?

> A:I just read through and I have to memorise the diagram which is drawn here and the description of the important parts---parts of the accident and the three passengers, which is supposed to be in the car.” [^21]

48     Juraimi testified as follows:

> “Q:…My client further instructs…Would you know if you were involved in such an accident on 30 August 2013?

> A:Your Honour, I was not involved in any way.” [^22]

49     The various “passengers” disclosed in the various Accident Statements also came forward and denied the Alleged Accident.

50     Mr Mohammad Ashrik Bin Mohamad Yusof was named in Exhibit P4, as one of Masliana’s alleged passengers. He testified in Court that he was not travelling as a passenger along Adam Road at the stated date and time. He was introduced by a relative of his, Bai (Sheik Effandi Mohamad Ali), to make an insurance medical injury claim. [^23] Bai made arrangements and instructed Mr Ashrik to see a doctor at a clinic near his home as well as to meet Rahmat and go to a law firm.

51     A further “passenger” of Masliana was called as a prosecution witness. Mr Mohamad Faiz testified that Sheik Effandi instructed him to tell the doctor that there was an accident in which he was the left rear passenger and that he suffered pain on his waist. [^24] Mr Faiz had earlier pleaded guilty to one charge under Section 420 read with Section 116 of the Penal Code and sentenced to probation. [^25]

52     Mr Muhammad Haidhar bin Zulkifli, yet another “passenger” of Masliana, confirmed during cross-examination that the Alleged Accident was not genuine:

> “Q:I see, okay. But you knew why you were in the lawyer’s office that day, yes?

> A:Yes.

> Q:To say that---well, to show that you had been in an accident, which actually never happened, correct?

> A:Yes.

> Q:Because, you see, it’s mentioned here in paragraph 5 of your conditioned statement: “I was told that I would be the rear passenger of the car.” Do you see the line there?

> A:Yes.

> Q:You were told this by Rahmat, I assume?

> A:Yes.

> Q:You knew that there was no car.

> A:Yes.

> Q:You knew you had not been a passenger.

> A:Yes.

> Q:You knew that there had been no accident.

> A:Yes.

> Q:You knew you were lying by representing that you were---had been in the car, yes?

> A:Yes.” [^26]

53     Mr Haidhar had earlier been given a stern warning for one offence under Section 420 read with Section 116 of the Penal Code.

54     The Accused was the sole voice in adamantly insisting that an accident had indeed taken place in the morning of 30 August 2013 along Adam Road involving the Accused’s Car, Masliana’s Car and Juraimi’s Lorry.

## (II)    OTHER “THEORIES” OF THE ACCUSED INCREDIBLE

## Theory 1: no personal injury claim by the Accused (unlike the others) meant that the Alleged Accident would be genuine

55     The Defence Counsel asserted during the cross-examination of Mr Albert Chua that a person who claimed to have been supposedly involved in those accidents did so to benefit by way of false personal injury claims, hoping to get a compensation payout, and in the Accused’s case, the Accused had not done so. [^27] The Defence Counsel had also contended during the cross-examination of Sollihin that it would have been very strange if the driver and passengers of the middle car claimed to have suffered backache or whiplash but the occupant of the first car did not claim to have suffered any injury at all. [^28]

56     I did not find this argument persuasive. Just because the Accused had not put in a claim for personal injury did not make a “phantom accident” any more genuine.

57     Indeed, it was speculative for the Defence Counsel to have contended that if some parties in an accident suffered personal injuries, surely other parties would too.

58     It took a further leap of logic for the Defence Counsel to contend that since the other “phantom passengers” claimed for personal injury, surely the Accused would have done likewise if they were all in cahoots, and since the Accused had not, the Accused’s accident report was truthful.

## Theory 2: Claim would have gone to the workshop, Accused did not stand to benefit, so he had no reason to falsify

59     Further, the Defence Counsel argued that any claim for vehicle damage would have gone to the workshop, not the Accused. [^29] He suggested that since there was no benefit to the Accused, he had little reason to falsify.

60     The Prosecution noted from the re-examination of Mr Albert Chua that he would not have known how the workshop handled the payout, if any, thereafter.

61     Also, Rahmat in re-examination also indicated that he would not know what a workshop did with the money it received from the insurance claims. [^30] He indicated that he was not in a position to know if there were any arrangements of apportionment between the workshop and the car owner. [^31]

## Theory 3: After staging a collision first, Masliana’s Car and Juraimi’s Lorry then went cruising for a victim along Adam Road, chancing upon the Accused’s Car

62     Another theory was that Masliana’s Car and Juraimi’s Lorry had been involved in a collision first, then got on Adam Road on 30 August 2013 at 9 am and just cruised for a victim, chancing upon the Accused’s Car and banging into the Accused’s Car.

63     I did not quite find this theory believable. If Masliana’s Car and Juraimi’s Lorry had already been in a staged accident, they could have gotten on with the false claim. Why would there be a need to involve and implicate an innocent victim? An innocent person, who is not complicit in the scheme, increases the risk of detection and the unravelling of the scheme. This proposition was also not put forth to Juraimi.

## Theory 4: Removal of the Accused’s Car from the Workshop to join in a staged accident

64     Another theory put forth by the Defence Counsel was as follows: after the Accused had gotten into a genuine accident, he deposited his car with the workshop for repairs and someone took his car out to hit other vehicles and/or get hit by other vehicles.

65     The Defence Counsel postulated that because:

> (a)     Sollihin referred business to Master Motors;

> (b)     Rahmat worked for Sollihin’s business Partners Automotive as well as helped out at Master Motors;

> (c)     E-Motors was the sole proprietorship of Sollihin’s wife and E-Motors operated from the premises of Master Motors,

> when the Accused went to Master Motors to lodge a genuine report about a genuine accident, Sollhin would come to know about it.

66     During cross-examination of Sollihin, the Defence Counsel asserted:

> “Q:I further suggest to you that **_if at all any staged accident was done involving my client’s car, it was done after he gave the car to Master Motors_** and when he no longer had the car with him and without his knowledge.

> A:No---

> …

> A:\---that is not true.” [^32]

> \[emphasis my own\]

67     Again, I did not find this theory quite believable. If a genuine accident had indeed taken place in the morning of 30 August 2013 between the Accused’ Car, Masliana’s Car and Juraimi’s Lorry, there was little logic in subsequently removing the Accused’s Car from the workshop to have another collision with the **same** vehicles (Masliana’s Car and Juraimi’s Lorry).

68     I doubted also that the Accused’ Car was removed from the workshop to have a collision with **other** vehicles, as the evidence in Court was that there were no Accident Statements involving the Accused’ Car during that period, except for Masliana’s and Juraimi’s.

## (III)    THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES’ ACCOUNT OF HOW THE ALLEGED ACCIDENT WAS STAGED

69     Rahmat described how the Alleged Accident was staged: [^33]

> (a)     Sollihin instructed him to take a Mazda from Far East Shopping Centre, from someone not known to him. This was the Mazda at page 5 of P4, which Masliana ultimately claimed to be the driver of, i.e. Masliana’s Car.

> (b)     Rahmat took Masliana’s Car home and waited for Sollihin to call him.

> (c)     That night, Sollihin called Rahmat and told him to collect a lorry at Yishun, to be the last vehicle, in order to stage the accident. This would come to be “Juraimi’s Lorry”.

> (d)     At a car park in Yishun, the lorry driver, Sollihin and Rahmat discussed how to stage the accident.

> (e)     Thereafter, Rahmat drove Juraimi’s Lorry and Sollihin drove Masliana’s Car to a secluded area somewhere in Mandai or at the zoo.

> (f)     Rahmat drive Juraimi’s Lorry and hit the rear of Masliana’s. At that time, there was no vehicle in front of Masliana’s Car.

> (g)     This staged collision took place in the early hours of 30 August 2013. [^34]

> (h)     Rahmat then drove Juraimi’s Lorry back to the car park in Yishun. Sollihin also drove Masliana’s Car back to the car park in Yishun and rode his vehicle and sent Rahmat home.

> (i)     The following day, Sollihin messaged Rahmat and gave him the details of the first car, to pass the information to the lorry driver. The vehicle number which Sollihin passed to Rahmat was SGV9240R, the Accused’s Car.

70     Rahmat also drew the sketch plan at page 4 of Exhibit P4. He also prepared the content of the report at Master Motors workshop where he was working at, with information provided by Sollihin. Rahmat also met Masliana and 3 other passengers at Chinatown Point to submit personal injuries claims.

71     Sollihin was called as the sixth prosecution witness. He testified that he was involved in the staging of accidents: he would get others to supply him with the vehicles. He had his people who wanted to be involved in the accident. Together, they would stage the accident, usually at deserted places, to make claims for property damage, for repairs and personal injuries. [^35]

72     Sollihin benefitted from the claims for property damage and repairs and from the personal injury referrals. The drivers would benefit from having their vehicles repaired to a better condition. Phantom passengers would gain from the personal injury claims.

73     The details in the accident reports submitted were all bogus:

> “Q:Right, so when the phantom drivers lodge a report at the reported date and time and the place, would there be an accident that takes place as reported at the exact same time, place and date?

> A:The place, time as reported is just fabrication, Your Honour, the accident did not happen”. [^36]

74     The staging of the accidents usually took place a day earlier or at night, before a report was made the next day, to ensure that the vehicles were damaged before anyone made any report. The details of the staged accidents were also usually tied to the routes of the lorry drivers to make the accident appear to have appeared enroute their deliveries. [^37]

75     In respect of the Alleged Accident, Sollihin gave evidence that the Accused provided the Accused’s Car for the purpose of staging the accident. He had collected the Accused’s Car from the Accused at his house in Yishun, the day before 30 August 2013, or just after midnight on 30 August 2013.

76     Sollihin testified that Masliana’s Car was provided by Shek Effendy. [^38]

77     Juraimi also deposed that after Rahmat had taken over Juraimi’s Lorry and had done what he had to do, Juraimi had to make an accident report and he would be paid $1,200. [^39] He handed Juraimi’s Lorry over to Rahmat the night prior to 30 August 2013 at the car park of Block 783 Yishun. [^40] He was given a piece of paper showing the position of 3 vehicles but only with 2 vehicle numbers and he was also told that Adam Road would be the accident location. [^41] Juraimi suggested the accident time of about 8.45 am when Rahmat suggest Adam Road as Juraimi would be passing through Adam Road the next morning. [^42] The next day, before Juraimi made his report, he received a message from Rahmat: it was the vehicle number for the remaining vehicle, the Accused’s Car. [^43]

78     Juraimi gave a plausible reason why he only lodged his Accident Report a few days after on 2 September 2013: he did not have his company stamp in respect of Juraimi’s Lorry which belonged to his company. That did not dilute his evidence that indeed the handover of Juraimi’s Lorry took place on the night of 29 August 2013; he was confident of this fact. [^44]

79     The evidence of Rahmat, Sollihin and Juraimi largely corroborated each other.

80     I recognised the discrepancies between Rahmat’s evidence and Sollihin’s evidence, such as the details of the staging of the alleged accident. For instance, Rahmat was firm in his recollection that the Accused’s Car was not present at the time of the staged collision in Mandai/at the zoo, contrary to what Sollihin testified.

81     Further, Sollihin mentioned that he picked up the Accused’s vehicle at his residence in Yishun, while the Accused and his wife Suliana Binte Sukiman testified that at material time, they were not living in Yishun [^45].

82     However, given the lapse of time between the offence and the trial, I had to allow for human fallibility in retention and recollection. In any case, by Sollihin’s admission he was involved in many staged accidents so it was of no surprise if he had been mistaken in his recollection of certain details.

## (IV)    THE ACCUSED’S “AT WORK” ALIBI

83     The Accused asserted that he was working from 7 pm on 29 August 2013 to 7 am on 30 August 2013, at the SUTL building. [^46] He was on the way home and got into a genuine accident at about 9 am along Adam Road.

84     Sarizad bin Hashim (“Sarizad”), at material time a supervisor of Loyal Group Facilities Private Limited, gave inconsistent evidence as to the Accused’s working hours.

85     In his statement recorded on 19 Feb 2018 at 5.40 pm [^47], he stated that he mentioned in an earlier interview with the police that the Accused worked till 6 or 7 am as he “pitied \[the Accused\]” [^48]. However, in this statement itself, he stated that the latest the Accused ever worked at SUTL building was until around 10 or 11 pm, not overnight. [^49]

86     In Court, Sarizad testified that “PM Shift” would suggest a work shift from 5.30 pm (on 29 August 2013) to late night or maybe early morning the next day (i.e. 30 August 2013) [^50]. However, he did not maintain the timings of the people working under him. [^51] Indeed, the timing the PM shift ends “depends on each individual” [^52] and “as for \[the Accused\], \[it was\] up to him to end what time or he start what time \[sic\]”. [^53]

87     Sarizad tried to explain his inconsistencies by casting blame on the manner in which his statement was taken by the investigation officer. However, I was not persuaded that there had been any irregular in the manner in which his statement was taken.

88     Mohd Rajim B. Mohd Razali (“Rajim”), a Facility Supervisor at SUTL Logistic & Warehousing, testified that Loyal Group representatives such as the Accused may work the night shift as well, continuing until 10 or 11 pm, but they may “drag…behind \[his\] back” [^54].

89     Despite raising the possibility that work could have been done overnight till early the following morning, Rajim and Sarizad **did not go to the extent** of saying that they worked alongside the Accused or saw him working throughout, until 7 am on 30 August 2013. [^55]

90     Even on the Accused’s own evidence, I did not find the payslips to be conclusive as to the Accused’s whereabouts at material time:

| 

“Q:

 | 

Do you agree that during this period, you were also working at other buildings?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And this is not reflected in the payslips?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. In other words, the payslips do not actually show that you were at SUTL building at all times, agree?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

In fact, you are working at multiple buildings---

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

for your work?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And this is not captured on the payslips?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So, would you agree that the payslips in exhibit E would not actually show that you were working in SUTL building?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

On the 29th of August 2013?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No \[as spoken by the Witness in English\].

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

“No, Your Honour”.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

You could be at any building in Singapore that is not reflected on the payslip, agree?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Do you mean on the 29 of August?

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

On the 29 of August 2013, the payslips show that you were working at SUTL Building.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

But as you have agreed earlier, the payslips do not show that y---that you could have been somewhere else other than SUTL building?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Agree?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So this show---the payslip shows that you were at SUTL building when in fact, you were working at Tung Centre on 19 September 2013, agree?

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

“Yes. Your Honour, Tung Centre was all ad hoc work, or other buildings that we went to were all ad hoc work”.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

This is my \[as spoken by Witness in English\]---

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So you agree that the payslip is actually quite unreliable in saying that you were working at SUTL building for the pay period as stated?

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

But, from the picture, it’s quite clear you were not at the SUTL building, agree?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And, in fact, the SUTL building would be quite far away from the Dairy Farm Condominium, agree?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So this payslip would not be an accurate evidence of where you were during your working hours? Agree?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.” [^56]

91     The Accused gave evidence that for his job, when they were suspended on the rope, it was a strict requirement that they had to work in pairs or more. [^57] However, he did not call other co-workers who could give clear evidence that the Accused was indeed working throughout the night as alleged.

92     Also, his own wife Ms Suliana had initially testified that she had seen her husband at home when she came back from work on the evening of 30 August 2013. If so, then the payment voucher’s indication of the PM shift cannot be accurate. [^58]

93     The photographs and videos tendered during the course of the trial also do not unequivocally show that the Accused was at work throughout the night and ended his shift and left for home in the morning as alleged. In fact, some pictures, rather unhelpfully, depicted the Accused at work at other locations on another occasion, such as at a condominium at Dairy Farm. [^59]

94     Conversely, photographs of the accident, which the Accused said he took in the aftermath, were never placed before the Court or used in his Accident Statement. The Accused said that he had gotten out of his car and taken photographs of the cars in the collision. He claimed that he had lost his phone and the photographs were not backed up or copied.

## (E)    WAS THERE A CONSPIRACY WITH SOLLIHIN AND PERSONS UNKNOWN?

95     Rahmat gave evidence that he was involved in Sollihin’s fraudulent claims on insurance, for the car, property damage and personal injuries; Sollihin gave him instructions to damage cars. [^60]

96     For a conspiracy to exist, it is not necessary that all the co-conspirators should be equally informed as to the details, nor for them to have met one another. It is sufficient that an accused knew of the purpose of the conspiracy, the acts done by the principal is one which according to ordinary experience and common sense, the abettor must have seen it as foreseeable and the accused participated through some act. [^61]

97     One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been coordinated by arrangement beforehand. [^62]

98     As set out in _PP v Yeo Choon Poh_[^63], “the essence of a conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take place in private in such circumstances that direct evidence of it will rarely be available”. [^64]

99     The actions and words of the parties should constitute evidence of the conspiracy.

100    In my analysis, it **could not have been mere coincidence** that the 3 Accident Statements of the Accused, Masliana and Juraimi made reference to the same Alleged Accident. In fact, it was the cornerstone of such “phantom accident” scams that each participant weaves his part of the story, such fabrications like jig-saw pieces which come together to form the composite picture of the Alleged Accident.

101    Indeed, Sollihin stated that the Accused’ role in the conspiracy was to report that he had been involved in an accident and to provide his vehicle for use in the staged accident. [^65]

102    The Accused made attempts to dissociate himself from Sollihin.

103    M1’s representative Chang Siew Yen testified at on 30 August 2013 at 21:31:03, Sollihin received a missed call from the Accused’s number “XXX”. [^66] There was no prior trace of a call from Sollihin’s number to the Accused’s number.

104    Since the Accused confirmed that he was the only user of the phone number “XXX” from July to September 2013 [^67], it must have been the Accused who initiated the telephone calls to Sollihin, not a situation of the Accused returning a call to Sollihin.

105    On 31 August 2013, there was also a call from the Accused’s number to Sollihin’s number. The Accused tried to explain that he was merely returning a call that he missed, but there was no prior call from that number.

106    Rahmat said that at the time of the staging of the collision between the Mazda and the Lorry, the Accused and his Car were not there. However, there is **no requirement for physical presence** with other co-conspirators to prove a conspiracy. [^68]

107    In respect of the Accused, I was satisfied on the evidence as a whole that he must have conspired with one or more of the others.

108     **Taking into account the totality of the evidence, I found that the Prosecution has made out its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I found the Accused guilty and convict him accordingly.**

## PRESCRIBED PUNISHMENT

109    The punishment prescribed for an offence under Section 402 read with Section 116 of the Penal Code is as follows:

> “Section 420    Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter, or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with **_imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to a fine_**.

> Section 116    Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence is not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with **_imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence_**…”

> \[emphasis my own\]

## ANTECEDENTS

110    The Accused is traced:

> (a)     5 November 2004: sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for one count under Section 75(1) of the Police Force Act for being absent without official leave;

> (b)     28 January 2005: sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment for one count of desertion under the Vigilante Corps Act; and

> (c)     11 August 2009: 4 months’ imprisonment for drugs consumption under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. One count of drug consumption and one count of having a mark, plate or document, resembling a licence as to be calculated to deceive under Section 129(2)(B) of the Road Traffic Act was taken into consideration for sentencing.

## SENTENCES SOUGHT BY THE PROSECUTION

111    The Prosecution sought a sentence of 7 to 8 months’ imprisonment [^69], citing the need for general deterrence.

112    Motor insurance fraud affects the delivery of financial services and when the motor insurance industry suffers staggering underwriting losses, this would translate to an increase in premium for the general public. In the light of Singapore’s compulsory third party insurance regime, it was in the public interest to deter motor insurance fraud.

113    The Prosecution also highlighted that in the present case, the scheme involved an orchestra of players, from Sollihin, to Masliana and Juraimi (“phantom drivers”), to Mohammad Faiz Bin Anwar, Mohammad Ashrik Bin Mohamad Yusof and Muhammad Haidhar (“phantom passengers”). For syndicated crimes involving pre-meditation, sophistication and planning, deterrence is a key sentencing concern.

114    The Prosecution highlighted the case of _PP v Tijan Syafiq Bin Selamat_ **_[^70]_**, where the court stated that even where the accused had not gotten into and the driven the car himself, that was immaterial and did not detract from his overall involvement in the conspiracy. The accused agreeing to give his version of the alleged accident to corroborate with the others and paint a picture of a genuine accident was a critical part of the conspiracy. [^71]

115    The Prosecution also tendered a table of precedents (all of which were plead guilty cases), which I reproduce below:

116    The precedents show that the sentences imposed for similar cases range from 4 to 7 months in plead guilty cases.

117    The Prosecution pointed out that the Accused however had not pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and therefore an uplift from the sentencing precedents was appropriate. The Prosecution proposed an imprisonment term of 7 to 8 months.

## DEFENCE COUNSEL’S SUBMISSIONS

118    The Defence Counsel noted that the cases highlighted by them carried a range of sentences and in most, if not all, of the cases, the accused person faced more than 1 charge and had other charges taken into consideration.

119    The Defence Counsel highlighted that the Accused has 3 young school-going children. His wife is now the sole breadwinner for the family. The Accused had been deeply affected by the proceedings and the conviction.

120    The Defence Counsel pointed out that the Accused did not submit any claim for personal injury, and the Accused’s Car belonged to his father, which underwent repairs that were valued by the workshop to have cost about $10,000, but no pay-out was ever received.

121    The Defence Counsel cited the case of _PP v Teo Kian Hwee Edwin_[^72], in which the accused faced 5 charges, of which 2 were proceeded and 3 taken into consideration for sentencing. The amount of the damage claim was $26,815 and there was also a personal injury claim for $14,450.

122    2 further cases were cited by the Defence Counsel; his summary is reproduced below [^73]:

123    The Defence Counsel highlighted that Kamarulzaman and Shazali faced more charges than the Accused and / or for an amount more than the Accused’s damage claim amount, and / or one of the 2 said persons were traced, unlike the Accused.

124    The Defence Counsel submitted that 2 to 3 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

## MY DECISION ON SENTENCE

125    I accepted that the Accused had no antecedents of a similar nature.

126    However, I noted also that he had not pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and thus the mitigating factor of a timeous plea of guilt could not be availed to him. His personal circumstances and hardship were also not so exceptional as to merit much mitigating weight.

127    I accepted that syndicated offences often involve a high degree of pre-meditation, sophistication and planning, and are often hard to detect. Further, motor insurance fraud can cripple the motor insurance industry with unjustified payouts, and affect the man in the street with elevated premium costs charged by the insurers.

128    A message of general deterrence should be conveyed to deter like-minded individuals from committing similar offences.

129    For completeness, I had sought clarification on the sentences of Masliana and Juraimi. I was informed that they were charged under different sections of the Penal Code:

> (a)     Masliana faced a total of 15 charges, all under Section 417 of the Penal Code, of which only 4 charges were in respect of the Alleged Accident; and

> (b)     Juraimi faced 1 charge, under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code ($18,750 was paid out), in relation to Alleged Accident. He was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment.

130    I noted from the cited precedents of Section 420 read with Section 116 Penal Code cases, **where the claim amount was about $10,000 and the accused had pleaded guilty, the typical sentence was between 4 to 7 months’ imprisonment:**

> (a)     Muhammad Rashid Bin Dogol, $9,239.70, 5 months

> (b)     Muhammad Firdaus Bin Roslan, $10,532.30, 7 months

> (c)     Mohd Redzwan Bin Mohd Raseah, $11,055.60, 5 months

> (d)     Tan Yong Hao Kelvin, $9,931.60, 4 months

> (e)     Kamarulzaman bin Mansor, $9,896.25, 4 months

131    I was of the view that an imprisonment term of **6 months was appropriate**, factoring in the fact that in the present case the mitigating factor of a timeous plea of guilt would not apply. In fact, the sentence for Muhammad Firdaus Bin Roslan might well be considered harsher.

132    This sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment was also not discordant with the Defence Counsel’s case of _Kamarulzaman_, weighing, inter alia, the fact that Kamarulzaman had charges taken into consideration but the Accused did not plead guilty and his claim amount was higher.

## CONCLUSION

133    Given the prescribed punishment and the sentencing spectrum, the sentence imposed against the Accused cannot be said to be excessive, much less manifestly excessive.

134    The Accused is presently on bail pending appeal.
